BREAKING: SEC Says to Exchanges That It's Leaning Toward Approving Ethereum Spot ETFs - Bitcoin Sistemi


SEC officials said today they are leaning toward approving exchanges on which Ethereum Spot ETF products will be listed, Barrons reported and people familiar with the matter said.
The agency made comments on the applications that, if resolved in a timely manner, could result in approvals as soon as this week.


The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has indicated that it is leaning toward approving spot Ethereum ETFs, according to sources familiar with the matter cited by Barrons. SEC officials informed the stock exchanges where the products will be listed about these trends yesterday.
The agency has provided feedback on the applications and could seek approvals as early as this week if any issues raised are resolved in a timely manner.





Notably, the SEC provides feedback to most issuers, even those with response deadlines later in the year. This may indicate that the SEC intends to coordinate the launch of several ETH ETFs at the same time.
Approval of ETFs could open the ETH market to institutional investors, such as foundations and pension funds, who are currently unable or unwilling to invest directly in cryptocurrencies. It could also lead to increased interest in smaller cryptocurrencies like Solana and Avalanche as investors consider other tokens increasingly likely to eventually receive approval for inclusion in funds.


However, even if the SEC approves the initial 19b-4 filings this week, it does not mean that ETH ETFs will launch at the same time. The agency has yet to provide feedback to some issuers on their S-1 filings, another critical part of the launch of ETFs.

Ethereum Flips Mastercard in Market Cap, Eyes on Visa Next


							

Ethereum has now surpassed Mastercard‚Äôs market valuation by around $15B.



This comes after ETH soared by 20% amid optimism about spot ETF approval.



If ETH cracks its ATH $4,891, its market cap will exceed that of Visa by $17B.




In a significant development, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has eclipsed the market valuation of Mastercard, a global leader in payment processing.



According to recent data, Mastercard‚Äôs market capitalization stands at $427.3 billion, reflecting a modest decline of 0.13% over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum‚Äôs market capitalization now exceeds $441.8 billion.



This surge comes after Ethereum‚Äôs price rallied by over 20% within the last few hours, reaching a two-month high of $3,714. While Ethereum has experienced a slight correction, settling at $3,678 at the time of writing, its market valuation remains comfortably ahead of Mastercard‚Äôs by $14.5 billion.



ETH market statistics | CoinMarketCap



The significant uptick in Ethereum‚Äôs price can be partly attributed to growing optimism surrounding the SEC‚Äôs approval of pending applications for Ethereum spot ETFs.



Specifically, the SEC has reportedly contacted at least one exchange and one potential issuer of an Ethereum spot ETF to request updates on their 19b-4 filings. Industry insiders familiar with the situation suggest that this could signal an increased likelihood of SEC approval.



Reflecting on these developments, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have revised upwards their prediction for SEC approval of an Ethereum spot ETF, from a 25% probability to a more optimistic 75%.



 
 




Following the SEC‚Äôs approval for Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $73,750 in March. A similar scenario is being contemplated for Ethereum.



Meanwhile, Ethereum‚Äôs market capitalization remains $128 billion below that of Visa, one of Mastercard‚Äôs closest competitors in the payment processing space. Notably, if Ethereum surpasses its 2021 all-time high of $4,891, its market valuation would reach $587 billion, exceeding that of Visa by $17.72 billion.

$386,330,000 Liquidated As Ethereum Rips Before Potential ‚ÄòShock‚Äô ETF Decision - The Daily Hodl


								Ethereum (ETH) has exploded in price on hopes of an approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Bitcoin rallied alongside ETH, and the sudden move has liquidated nearly $400 million worth of traders positions, according to current data from Coinglass.










The odds of an SEC approval of Ethereum ETFs were originally slim to none, but late on Monday, Bloomberg ETF experts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart announced they were raising the odds to 75%, up from 25%.
‚ÄúUpdate: 
James Seyffart and I are increasing our odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they‚Äôd be denied).‚Äù
According to Washington, D.C.-based crypto legal expert Jake Chervinsky, the approval of an Ethereum ETF would be a ‚Äúshock‚Äù to those close to Capitol Hill.
‚ÄúIf the spot ETH ETF is approved, it will be a true shock to everyone I know in DC who‚Äôs close to this process.
That doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt happen.
It means approval could signal a major shift in US crypto policy after the SAB (Staff Accounting Bulletin) 121 vote, perhaps more important than the ETF itself‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs hard to believe this SEC would do us any favors like approving the spot ETH ETF.
But policy is politics, and crypto has been winning the political battle for months.
Maybe the Biden camp saw how many voters Trump could win with one pro-crypto comment and decided to pivot.‚Äù
Reuters reported that ‚Äúfour people familiar with the matter‚Äù said the SEC has already asked Nasdaq, CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) and the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) to ‚Äúfine-tune their applications‚Äù to list spot Ethereum ETFs, ‚Äúsignaling the agency may be poised to approve the filings.‚Äù
At time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,798.

New Development in the Massive GALA Hack - Founder Makes a Statement - Bitcoin Sistemi


The wallet address associated with the recent Gala Games (GALA) attack partially returned the stolen funds.
According to Onchain data, the wallet in question transferred back 5,913.2 ETH worth $22.5 million. This figure is close to the amount of GALA tokens sold immediately after the attack on Monday.


Earlier this week, an unknown hacker mined 5 billion GALA tokens worth over $200 million. This incident led to a 15% drop in the price of the platform's native token, GALA.
Eric Schiermeyer, co-founder of Gala Games, known online as Benefactor, announced that the attacker sold 600 million GALA, worth approximately $21 million at the time, and burned the remaining 4.4 billion tokens. He also added that Gala Games blocked and removed unauthorized access to the GALA contract within 45 minutes of the attack.






‚ÄúWe messed up our internal controls,‚Äù Schiermeyer admitted.

‚ÄúThis should not have happened and we are taking steps to ensure it never happens again. We believe we have identified the culprit and are now working with the FBI, DOJ and a network of international authorities.‚Äù

In his statement on Discord, Schiermeyer added that the amount sent back by the hacker will probably be used for GALA token buybacks and burns.

Bitcoin price prediction: Will its next ATH be closer to $77K? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin price hit $71,000, leading the market to hit a fear and greed index of 76.
The liquidation heatmap pinpointed $76.900 as the next target for BTC.

Bitcoin‚Äôs [BTC] price hit $71,000 for the first time in almost 40 days, bringing optimism back to the market.¬† The price increase aligned with AMBCrypto‚Äôs recent analysis which explained how the bull run was not over.
Beyond the metrics mentioned in that article, there were other reasons BTC recovered. First on the register were the ETFs. For those unfamiliar, a Bitcoin ETF is not the same as BTC.
It, however, suggests that an investor has exposure to Bitcoin. As such, if the price of the cryptocurrency increases, then the ETF Net Asset Value (NAV), which represents the value of each share, would also increase.
The heavyweights are back
In the first quarter of 2024, billions of dollars flowed into Bitcoin ETFs, prompting the price to reach an all-time high before the halving. However, the issuers failed to attract the king of capital they once had during the first part of the second quarter.
As a result, BTC slumped, slipping below $59,00 at one point. However, that condition has changed for the better. As of the 20th of May, the total netflow into Bitcoin ETFs was $235 million.
This meant that ARK, BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale had registered inflows for four straight days. If sustained, Bitcoin‚Äôs price could be in line to rise past $73,000 before the end of May.
Apart from this data, AMBCrypto looked at the fear and greed index. According to Glassnode, Bitcoin‚Äôs fear and greed index returned to 76‚Äî an 8.57% increase in the last 24 hours.
Source: Glassnode
This reading, represented by the color green, implies the market was in the greedy region. The last time BTC rallied to a new high, the metric hit 90‚Äî an extremely greedy (blue) region.
Liquidations pour in: What‚Äôs next for BTC?
As it stands, Bitcoin was not at a point where positive investor sentiment was exaggerated. With this position, the coin price might still appreciate, and rising close to $75,000 could be possible in a few days.
Furthermore, it is noteworthy to mention that $96.87 million worth of BTC contracts were liquidated in the last 24 hours. According to Coinglass, short liquidations accounted for almost $80 million while the rest were longs.
Source: Coinglass
For context, shorts are traders betting on the price of an asset to decrease. Longs, on the other hand, place bets on a price increase.
In addition, AMBCrypto analyzed the liquidation heatmap to check the next level for Bitcoin‚Äôs price to hit. Liquidation heatmap helps traders to identify areas of high liquidity.

If liquidity is concentrated in a region, price might move toward the point while large liquidations can also occur. According to data from Hyblock, high liquidity existed from $73,300 and above.
Therefore, Bitcoin could squeeze past its all-time high, and a target of $76,900 could be the next peak it hits.

                        In the year of the presidential election, Donald Trump tokens are gaining momentum in the DEX markets. Recently, a new Solana meme coin called ‚ÄòSuper Trump‚Äô has seen a significant surge ‚Äì jumping to the top of meme coin markets.This article will provide an analysis of Super Trump‚Äôs current price trends and look to see whether an innovative new multi-chain dog coin, DOGEVERSE, represents a more promising investment opportunity at this time.Super Trump went viral after being featured as a meme call amongst many popular crypto call channels.Super Trump Price Analysis: US Presidential Election Fuels Trump Token Popularity in Solana Meme Coin Markets
As price action fights to hold position, Super Trump is currently trading at a market price of $0.0006, down around 41% in the past 24 hours.The retracement move has eaten away at Super Trump‚Äôs rally since around 5PM (UTC) on May 20, with a quick-fire sell-off from early investors after the price hit an all-time high at $0.0043 (a jaw-dropping return of over 150,000% for the earliest backers).Amid this sell-off, price action hammered down in a much-needed price correction, leaving Super Trump trading in an accumulation zone between $0.0005 and $0.0007.So far, this has been a well-defended level by holders, with more than 12 hours of consolidation now established at these levels.Yet, Super Trump remains below overhead resistance from the downtrend, leaving holders targeting a further 2-4 hour period of consolidation before the downtrend is potentially invalidated.However, beyond the enduring meme value of a Trump-themed coin, there are strong reasons to be optimistic at these levels.Firstly, with early-backers flushed out by the sell-off, Super Trump can now rally further organically without significant risk of early-backer profit-taking behavior.Secondly, with the retracement move leaving Super Trump at a more alluring lower market cap of around $150k ‚Äì late-stage retail capital could be enticed by a 10x gainer if previous price action repeats again.This is reflected in the growing buy-pressure in the order book, which has shifted to 52.5% of transactions in the past hour.But while holders sit tight, other investors are shifting their attention to a soon-to-launch multi-chain dogecoin project.Discover the Next Solana Meme Coin to Pump in May 2024: DOGEVERSE
While Super Trump offers a high-risk opportunity, the biggest gains can be accrued through presale opportunities, which position investors as early birds able to capture the lion‚Äôs share of project growth ‚Äì just imagine investing in Super Trump before it hit the market and skyrocketed 15o,000%.One such opportunity in the SOL ecosystem is¬†the DOGEVERSE presale¬†‚Äì which has unlocked viral success over the last two weeks to hit $15M raised in the ongoing presale.Aiming to be the first multi-chain incarnation of DOGE, DOGEVERSE is positioned to grow rapidly as market participants race to grab a piece of the pie.DOGEVERSE is still raising funds at the presale stage and will start preparing for exchange listings very soon.Buy DOGEVERSE Here

GameStop Who? Ethereum ETF Hype Sends Crypto Memes Flying - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsRemember last week's GameStop-fueled meme stock hype that helped propel meme coin prices? Well, the crypto narrative has already changed, and now it's Ethereum ETF hype that's juicing the markets... and yes, meme coins are again flying.After Ethereum (ETH) exploded with historic intensity late Monday, surging some 23% within¬†hours amid renewed rumors around spot Ethereum ETF renewal, a few meme coins appear to have hitched a ride to the moon off the momentum‚Äîincluding, curiously, one of Solana‚Äôs most iconic meme tokens.Pepecoin (PEPE), one of Ethereum‚Äôs top meme coins, is up a whopping 32% in the last 24 hours. The streak has pushed PEPE to a new all-time high price above $0.0000128‚Äîalbeit still worth a fraction of a cent. For the first time, also, the meme coin has surpassed a market capitalization of $5 billion.¬†What caused the major bump? It appears PEPE is‚Äîalmost exactly‚Äîmirroring ETH‚Äôs rise.After rumors began circulating yesterday that applications to trade spot ETH ETFs on Wall Street might soon be approved‚Äîrather than denied, as many expected‚ÄîETH instantly began climbing upwards yesterday afternoon. It hasn‚Äôt stopped yet, breaking $3,800 multiple times Tuesday morning.¬†Down to the minute, Pepe began surging exactly when ETH took off yesterday afternoon. It‚Äôs unclear, though, what connection PEPE has to the ETH ETF saga, besides being one of the top meme coins on Ethereum. Meme coins are notably volatile and can be swayed by social media sentiment, however, so PEPE may be feeling the love as traders get hyped over ETH gains.The top two meme coins, however, had more marginal gains. Dogecoin, which runs on its own chain, is up 10% in the last 24 hours; Shiba Inu, the only Ethereum meme coin larger than PEPE, is up just under 6%.¬†The other biggest beneficiary during ETH‚Äôs boom lives, curiously, over on Solana.

Buy signal for two strong cryptocurrencies this week


    The cryptocurrency market kicked off the week with strong bullish momentum, led by Ethereum‚Äôs (ETH) recent surge to $3800, causing notable gains across major altcoins.



Amid this surge, two cryptocurrencies are showing notable strong momentum. In this context Finbold turned to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) heatmap from CoinGlass on May 21 to identify potential buy signals.



Uniswap (UNI) showing strong buy signal



Uniswap (UNI), the first automated market maker (AMM) decentralized exchange, remains the most popular and leads with the highest exchange volume and liquidity for trading Ethereum tokens.¬†







Currently trading at $9.52, UNI experienced a 22% gain driven by excitement over a potential Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval.



Crypto Market RSI Heatmap: UNI. Source: CoinGlass



In the past 24 hours, UNI‚Äôs price rose by 22% to $9.34, breaking out of a six-week correction and signaling a major market shift. RSI values (1 hour at 70.36, 4 hours at 83.05, and 12 hours at 79.71) indicate overbought conditions, usually a sell signal, but strong buying pressure suggests a buy signal.



Uniswap Labs, in collaboration with Across Protocol, introduced ERC-7683, a new standard for cross-chain intents enhancing UNI‚Äôs utility and market value.¬†



Technical indicators, like the 50- and 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $8.35, provide strong support if the price reverts.¬†



The bullish divergence in daily RSI above 60% indicates continued buying pressure, making UNI a compelling buy



Strong momentum for Bonk (BONK)



Bonk is currently trading at $0.00003181, showing a 23.46% gain in the past day. Fueled by market excitement around the potential approval of ETH ETFs, Bonk recorded a 7.8% jump today, breaching the neckline resistance of $0.00003.



Crypto Market BONK Heatmap: UNI. Source: CoinGlass



The RSI values (1 hour at 61, 4 hours at 88, and 12 hours at 73) indicate strong buying pressure, with the sharp upswing in daily EMAs (20, 50, 100, and 200) highlighting aggressive buying activity.



These factors and technical indicators collectively present a strong buy signal for Bonk, making it an attractive investment opportunity.



While these cryptocurrencies show strong buy signals, it is important to exercise caution. The sustainability of this rally is uncertain, and many believe that a bearish correction is inevitable.¬†



Therefore, cryptocurrency investors should conduct thorough research and prioritize robust projects to ensure sound capital allocation.

Famous Philosopher Yuval Noah Harari Slams Bitcoin


Prominent Israeli philosopher Yuval Noah Harari, who is best known for his best-selling book "Sapiens," recently¬†took aim at Bitcoin, slamming it as "a currency of distrust."¬†Even though Bitcoin proponents might have good reasons to distrust the banks, their preference for the leading cryptocurrency is still based on the distrust of human institutions, Harari claims.The famous intellectual claims that this is an "alarming development" given that money is supposed to create trust between strangers.¬†"I understand the causes for this distrust, but it is an alarming development,' he said.¬†He hopes that humanity finds a way to build trustworthy human institutions in lieu of adopting technologies of distrust. The philosopher further added that humans control the world precisely because they learned to trust one another. He warned that algorithms could start controlling the world if humans put all their trust in them.¬†"Farmers grow food. Shoemakers make shoes. What is the function of the financial system? Finance creates trust," Harari says. He adds that various financial systems are supposed to create trust between strangers who can cooperate on shared projects.¬†"Originally, there was very little trust in institutions like banks and governments, so money was minted from gold. Since gold was scarce, this limited the amount of money and limited economic cooperation," he noted. Today, 90% of money is just computer data that cannot be easily comprehended by humans.¬†¬†In March, Harari also argued against using¬†artificial intelligence (AI) in finance. The philosopher warned that this technology could make financial regulation even less clear for humans. People should first gain an understanding of how AI operates and regulate it instead of integrating it into the financial system.¬†According to Harari's philosophy, humanity is largely driven by myths that make large-scale collective cooperation possible.¬†

Here Are All the Signs an ETH ETF Approval May Be Around the Corner - The Defiant

Rumors that the SEC is asking applicants to update filings and telling exchanges it's leaning to approve the rule change has sent ETH flying. Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) applicants have sprung into a flurry of activity as a major deadline towards the funds‚Äô approval nears.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday reportedly directed major exchanges, including Nasdaq and CBOE, to refine their applications for listing spot Ether ETFs, indicating that the agency may be preparing to approve these applications.Barron‚Äôs reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, that SEC staff informed exchanges on Monday it is leaning toward approving the products. The agency provided feedback on the applications, and if the issues are resolved promptly, approvals could be granted as early as this week, Barron‚Äôs reported.Financial asset management giant Fidelity filed an amended S-1 application on Monday, stating that ETH tokens underlying their spot ETFs will not be staked. Crypto asset manager Grayscale also filed an updated 19b-4 for their Ethereum Mini Trust, a spin-off of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which aims to convert the trust into a spot Ethereum ETF.This flurry of activity prompted Bloomberg Intelligence analysts to increase their odds that the SEC will approve the spot Ethereum ETFs by the May 23 deadline to 75%. The move prompted a massive rally in Ethereum‚Äôs native token, as a spot ETF traded in U.S. markets could potentially drive billions in inflows from institutional investors, as has been the case after the spot Bitcoin ETF was approved.ETH is up 19% in the past 24 hours to $3,733, the highest since March and just 23% away from its all-time high of $4,878, according to CoinGecko.ETH Price - CoinGeckoThis week, the SEC will review the applications filed by CBOE for Ether ETFs from VanEck and ARK Investments/21Shares. However, approval of the 19b-4 filings does not guarantee that the ETFs will be authorized. The S-1 applications must also be approved before the products can begin trading. If both the 19b-4 forms and the S-1 registration are approved, only then these funds can initiate trading.Forms S-1 and 19b-4The S-1, filed with the SEC, is a registration statement required for launching publicly traded securities products in the United States.The Form 19b-4, on the other hand, is used to inform the SEC of a proposed rule change by a self-regulatory organization (SRO). This form requests the SEC to approve new types of financial products or changes to existing rules, in this case, the listing of Ethereum ETFs.Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their odds for the approval of a spot Ether ETF to 75% from 25% on Monday, following reports of a potentially more favorable stance by the SEC.However, they later clarified that these odds were specific to the 19b-4 approvals.Standard Chartered, a financial institution managing over $800 billion in assets, said in a report it anticipates that the SEC will approve spot Ether ETFs by May 24.The list of ETF applicants awaiting SEC approval includes VanEck Ethereum ETF, ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust, Grayscale Ethereum Trust Conversion, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, iShares Ethereum Trust, Franklin Ethereum ETF, and Bitwise Ethereum ETF.Not So EasyShould the SEC classify Ethereum as a security, it may result in the rejection of the spot Ether ETF applications because, according to securities regulations, any asset classified as a security must comply with strict requirements, including registration and disclosure obligations. A securities classification could impose significant legal and operational challenges on entities looking to offer financial products based on Ethereum.In the past, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has refrained from explicitly stating whether ETH is a security.Notably, the SEC does not prescribe a specific timeline for decisions on ETF applications, which could be a cause in the delay in the approval of spot Ether ETFs.Under Gensler's leadership, the SEC declined several spot Bitcoin ETF applications due to concerns about market manipulation.Despite these rejections, the SEC was compelled to approve Bitcoin ETF products following a successful court challenge by Grayscale Investments.Approval of the spot Ether ETFs would be a regulatory milestone and could pave the way for more cryptocurrency-related financial products.Still, Gensler said in a Jan. 10 statement that the Bitcoin ETF approval should ‚Äúin no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.‚Äù

The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)

It remains to be seen whether Biden will veto the measure, despite the fact that the independent Government Accountability Office (GAO) said the SEC inappropriately imposed the guidance. However, the important thing here is that sane, bipartisan, crypto rulemaking is possible, despite the opposition of figures like arch crypto skeptic Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

A Whale Turned $83 into $79.4 Million on This Altcoin That ATH'd Today: 958,580x Profit - Bitcoin Sistemi


PEPE, one of the new generation memecoins of the cryptocurrency world, experienced an impressive rally and managed to reach its all-time high today.
This rise in PEPE, the world's third-largest memecoin, is attributed to improving market sentiment as hopes grow that Ethereum Spot ETF products will be approved by the SEC.


PEPE price has risen over 30% in the last 24 hours and is trading at $0.00001267 at the time of writing.
However, the rise in PEPE also revealed that a whale has made an incredible amount of profit. According to data provided by Lookonchain, a cryptocurrency whale has still not sold the PEPE tokens he bought by paying only $ 83, and the value of the tokens he currently holds is at $ 79.4 million.






This means that the whale wallet made a profit of 958,580x. Whale wallet is one of the earliest investors in the popular memecoin.
The whale, which consists of three wallets belonging to the same person or institution, bought 6.44 trillion PEPE tokens by paying 0.041 ETH, or 83 dollars, and has not made any sales so far.

Analyst bullish on Floki as Pepe and Bonk rally - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Analyst picks Floki Inu over Pepe and Bonk as meme coins join the crypto party
Surging Bitcoin and Ethereum could help FLOKI price higher.
Technical picture also bullish for the meme coin as price nears.

Pepe (PEPE) and Bonk (BONK) are up 33% and 24% respectively as the memecoin world bids to join the crypto party after Ethereum ETF news sparked a buying frenzy.
But while PEPE and BONK are standout performers among the top meme coins by market cap today, an analyst has shared some of the reasons to be bullish on Floki Inu (FLOKI).
‚Äú$PEPE and $BONK are both up over 34% today, showing that the memecoin economy is super strong,‚Äù crypto analyst Shelby noted via X.
While the two meme coins lead the gainers across the sector, the analyst points to Floki Inu (FLOKI) as one to watch.
According to Shelby, Pepe and Bonk‚Äôs massive spikes in the past 24 hours are a precursor of what the market could witness with Floki.
‚ÄúI believe now is a good time to start paying attention to Floki,‚Äù Shelby noted, pointing to Floki‚Äôs standing as one of the top meme coins. 
Floki‚Äôs ecosystem growth, which includes key product updates, is also a factor to consider when analyzing its price potential down the road.
Floki Inu‚Äôs growth and the 2024 roadmap
Floki has witnessed steady growth since the team unveiled the project‚Äôs 2024 roadmap earlier this year. 
With part of the goal being to move Floki beyond the memecoin status, key developments to watch include staking, Floki debit cards and digital bank and the flagship utility product Valhalla.
In the market, Floki price recently surged by more than 13% amid a new DAO proposal that sought community approval to burn 15,246,000,000 FLOKI.
According to an announcement on Tuesday, that burn is set to occur on May 22, 2024 following a 99.84% vote approval.
Floki Inu price today
Today‚Äôs 11% gains come as Floki mirrors prices of top coins BTC and ETH, with sentiment positive amid the potential approval of spot Ether ETFs by the SEC. 
A sharp rise for cryptocurrencies due to an approval could catapult FLOKI higher. The token burn, as in the recent case, also adds to the positive outlook.
However, the technical picture also supports an upside continuation for FLOKI with momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) hitting at bullish strength.

Floki Inu price is currently at $0.00022, its highest level since early April.

BREAKING: SEC Primed To Approve Ethereum ETFs This Week, Report Claims | Bitcoinist.com


								In a significant departure from their previous skeptical stance, US regulators are reportedly leaning toward approving the long-awaited spot Ethereum ETFs for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.¬†
SEC Staff Signals Spot Ethereum ETFs Approval
According to a report by Barron‚Äôs, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff communicated to exchanges on Monday that they are leaning towards approving these products.¬†

The agency has provided comments and guidance on the ETF applications, and if the ‚Äúoutstanding issues‚Äù are resolved in time, approvals could be granted as early as this week.
Furthermore, the SEC‚Äôs recent engagement with exchanges further underscores the regulator‚Äôs consideration of spot Ethereum ETFs. The commission reportedly contacted the Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to request updates and modifications to existing applications before¬†an upcoming regulatory deadline.
Of particular interest is VanEck‚Äôs spot Ether ETF, which has been pending SEC approval for the past 240 days. The commission is required to decide whether to approve or deny VanEck‚Äôs ETF by May 23.¬†
Shifting Landscape
The introduction of Ethereum spot ETFs would offer investors a more traditional and regulated route to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without the complexities associated with directly trading digital assets on cryptocurrency exchanges.
Suppose the SEC gives the green light to Ethereum spot ETFs. In that case, it will mark a significant milestone in the maturation and acceptance of Ethereum and the entire cryptocurrency market, as currently seen with the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETF market in both Hong Kong and the US.
The regulatory approval of such spot Ethereum ETFs products will increase transparency, improve market liquidity and potentially attract institutional investors waiting for a regulated framework to participate in the growing digital asset space.

While the final decision rests with the SEC, the agency‚Äôs positive disposition towards Ethereum ETFs indicates a shifting regulatory landscape, recognizing the potential benefits and demand for such investment vehicles.

At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,730, up nearly 20% in the past 24 hours, reaching a high of $3,840 on Tuesday‚Äôs trading session.

SEC's Feedback Propels Ethereum ETF Listings Closer To Approval, Insiders Claim | Bitcoinist.com


								In a move that has the crypto community buzzing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked major exchanges to refine their applications for spot Ethereum ETFs.¬†
According to a Reuters report, sources familiar with the process say this request is interpreted as a positive signal that the regulator may be ready to greenlight these long-awaited products.
Ethereum ETF Approvals Inch Closer
The exchanges in question ‚Äì Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE ‚Äì have been working on submissions to list Ethereum ETFs provided by asset managers like VanEck and ARK Investments/21Shares. Typically, such regulatory feedback from the SEC precedes approval rather than rejection.¬†
‚ÄúThe SEC‚Äôs engagement with the exchanges on the ether ETF filings is a surprising and encouraging development for the crypto industry,‚Äù said one source who declined to be named.

This shift in the SEC‚Äôs stance marks a potential sea change, as the regulator had previously appeared skeptical about approving spot-based cryptocurrency ETFs. Its rejection of numerous Bitcoin ETF applications over the years, citing market manipulation concerns, dampened industry hopes.
However, the SEC was forced to greenlight Bitcoin futures ETFs last October after a court challenge from Grayscale Investments and spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. Those products have since attracted significant interest from diverse investors, including hedge funds, wealth advisors, and retail traders.
Watershed Moment For Crypto Industry
The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs would be another major milestone for the crypto sector. ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has emerged as the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, trailing only Bitcoin.
‚ÄúAn SEC-approved Ethereum ETF would be a huge deal, providing investors with a regulated and convenient way to gain exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency,‚Äù said an industry executive familiar with the matter.

Per the report, the SEC‚Äôs decision on the Ethereum ETF filings is expected by the end of this week. While the exchange applications are just the first step in the approval process, and the SEC still needs to sign off on the ETF registration statements, this latest development has fueled optimism within the crypto community.
‚ÄúThe SEC‚Äôs willingness to engage constructively with the exchanges on these filings is a clear indication that the regulator may be warming up to the idea of ether ETFs,‚Äù the industry source said. ‚ÄúThis could be a major turning point for the crypto industry.‚Äù
The daily chart shows ETH‚Äôs price trending upwards. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com
As of the time of this reporting, ETH is trading at $3,780, having surged by a substantial 22% over the past 24 hours. This surge was¬†driven by rising market expectations of imminent approval for the new ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.¬†

How a falling Yen could fuel a crypto market boom, per Arthur Hayes - AMBCrypto



A weakening Japanese Yen could fuel currency wars.
A US intervention could lead to liquidity injection, fueling the crypto market rally.¬†

BitMEX exchange founder and Maelstrom crypto fund CIO Arthur Hayes stated that the weakening Japanese Yen (JPY) could induce liquidity and boost Bitcoin [BTC] and the rest of the crypto market.¬†
On his latest blog titled ‚ÄòEasy Button,‚Äô the exec noted that,¬†
‚ÄúI think that a USDJPY surge towards 200 is enough to put on the Chemical Brothers and ‚ÄúPush the Button.‚Äù
‚ÄòChemical Brothers‚Äô refers to the US and Japan, while ‚ÄòPush the Button‚Äô means printing money or ‚Äòinjection of liquidity.‚Äô¬†
At the time of writing, USDJPY traded at $156. The USD has strengthened against the Yen in 2024, with a YTD (year-to-date) performance of 10%. 
From the Yen‚Äôs perspective, the Japanese currency has depreciated massively in the past few months.¬†
How a depreciating Yen could boost crypto
According to Hayes, the plummeting Yen‚Äôs value could induce currency wars between Japan and China, forcing the US to intervene.¬†
For perspective, a dropping Yen means it will be cheaper for Japan to export more goods in bulk to the rest of the world. Such a move would make its exports very competitive compared to China‚Äôs.¬†
In retaliation, China could devalue its yuan (CNY) by printing more money to maintain its export advantage and stabilize the CNYUSD to the desired level.
 According to Hayes, the US could intervene and strengthen the Yen by devaluing the USD by increasing its supply.¬†
‚ÄòTo weaken the dollar, its supply must increase. Imagine the Japanese needed $1 trillion worth of firepower to strengthen the yen from 156 to 100 overnight.‚Äô
The ripple effect is a surge in the price of dollar-based assets due to increased supply in USD. Collectively, with an uptick in Yuan (CNY), a ‚Äòcrypto boom‚Äô could be likely.¬†
‚ÄòCrypto booms, as there is more dollar and yuan liquidity floating in the system‚Äô
Additionally, per Hayes, the above currency devaluation will be ripe for Bitcoin‚Äôs upswing because it is the ‚Äòbest-performing asset in the face of global fiat debasement.‚Äô
That said, this isn‚Äôt the first time the executive has predicted favorable macro conditions for crypto to rally. 
Hayes previously asserted that the US elections could increase US liquidity, which could drive risk-on assets, including BTC.¬†

Apeiron embraces competitiveness to drive Web3 gaming growth - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Web3 game Apeiron announced the start of its Guild Wars tournament on May 21, featuring a $1 million prize pool. The competition will start with different regional online preliminaries up until June 25, followed by an in-person showdown set to happen in Hong Kong in Q3.Frank Cheng, co-founder of Apeiron, explained to Crypto Briefing that the Guild Wars tournament taps into the competitive nature of the game.¬†
‚ÄúThe game is in real-time and there‚Äôs an action element that you can directly control the movements of your main avatar, and you can also use cards depending on the situation in real-time. So it‚Äôs quite like Clash Royale and Warcraft Rumble,‚Äù said Cheng.
Fostering a competitive landscape for Apeiron is a major strategy for the team, as this is a key component to attract more players, streamers, and casters into the ecosystem. ‚ÄúApeiron is a game that‚Äôs fun to play and watch at the same time. A lot of our upcoming exhibitions and our launch events will be centered around competition.‚ÄùThe $1 million prize pool will be split equally between cash and NFTs and will be destined for the top guilds. The event is open to the entire Web3 community and is already attracting major guilds, such as Avocado DAO and GuildFi.Why Ronin?Apeiron was initially deployed on Polygon‚Äôs infrastructure, but the team pivoted the project to Ronin in December 2023. Cheng explains that one of the reasons behind this movement is the potential Ronin ecosystem offers for partnerships.¬†
‚ÄúIn Web3, I think one of the most important things among developers is collaboration. And being in the Ronin Network is like being part of a family. And it‚Äôs important that we support not just SkyMavis and Axie Infinity, but other Ronin chain games in the ecosystem. We will do partnerships, we will do collabs. It‚Äôs a very founder-friendly environment that I only came to understand after the decision that we migrated to Ronin.‚Äù
Apeiron‚Äôs co-founder adds that Ronin presents itself as a very dedicated team, with broad support, such as marketing and technology, something that some blockchains lack nowadays.Moreover, Cheng praises the user-friendly wallet that Ronin was able to offer their users, which he assesses is fit for mobile gamers, a niche treated as the propelling factor for gaming.
‚ÄúMobile gamers, Asian gamers, this is where we see probably the earliest adoption happening compared to Steam console games. I think mobile game players are probably more receptive to blockchain operations and payments and micro-transactions. So mobile is something that we want. [‚Ä¶] I‚Äôd say they are actually one of the most powerful and user-friendly mobile gaming wallets.‚Äù

New York Man Arrested for Swindling $1,300,000 in Scheme Involving Fictitious Crypto Wallet - The Daily Hodl


								A New York man pled guilty to fraud charges last week after using various fake crypto and real estate schemes to swindle investors out of more than $1.3 million.
Thomas John Sfraga, who went by the alias ‚ÄúT.J. Stone,‚Äù defrauded more than a dozen victims, including friends and neighbors, according to an announcement from the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Eastern District of New York.










Sfraga painted himself as a serial entrepreneur with experience in real estate development, media relations, podcasting and cryptocurrencies. He also claimed that he emceed crypto events in New York City.
To facilitate his fraud, Sfraga pretended to own multiple businesses, which he called Vandelay Contracting Corp. and Build Strong Homes LLC.
The U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office notes that Vandelay could have been named after Vandelay Industries, a fictitious company in the television show ‚ÄúSeinfeld.‚Äù
Sfraga bilked victims in Brooklyn, Staten Island and Long Island by pretending to purchase, renovate and flip residential properties. He also defrauded a victim into investing in a fake crypto wallet and convinced an investor to sink $100,000 in cash to prop up a non-existent construction project.
But instead of making legitimate investments, Sfraga used the funds to enrich himself and pay older investors.
Sfraga faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and has been ordered to pay restitution of more than $1.33 million.

CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger on Overzealous Crypto Regulation and the Need for Legislative Action

It's a very tough, difficult topic because there's a lot of nuance. So these markets, which we call event contracts, are part of our statute that was added under the Dodd Frank Act. In the grand scheme of things, it's relatively new, but we've seen interest in these contracts for quite some time and it's certainly ramping up. The way Congress laid it out for us it said these contracts generally are OK, as long as they don't touch on a number of topics, like gaming, war, terrorism, assassination ‚Äì anything that's against federal law. There are a number of people who really don't like election contracts and would like to include them in this list.

Democrats To Abruptly Reverse Party Stance on Crypto To Avoid Election Disaster: Mike Novogratz - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of the crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital says Democrats are changing their tune on crypto as the 2024 US Presidential election approaches.
In a new interview with CNBC‚Äôs Squawk Box,¬†Mike Novogratz says the Biden administration is listening to the markets and shifting its standpoint on crypto.










‚ÄúBut assuming, you know, the market is¬†right, and the market is usually pretty smart, it feels like someone at the Biden White House¬†made a call¬†and said, guys, we can‚Äôt be the party against crypto anymore.¬†
I think that‚Äôs a seismic shift. If those things actually happen, prices are going to be much higher than here.‚Äù
When asked to clarify the meaning of his speculation, Novogratz doubled down, saying the Democrats don‚Äôt want crypto to cost them the election.
‚ÄúI am sensing a widespread shift amongst Democrats that don‚Äôt want to let crypto be a big election issue. The crypto super PACs (Political Action Committees) have raised over $150 million, and they have targeted Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester, elections that matter dearly to Democrats in swing states, in vulnerable Senate seats.¬†
Crypto should be bipartisan. And quite frankly, for our industry to do well, it needs to be bipartisan. And it has been really Elizabeth Warren and a small group of people that have held the Democrats hostage on this. What the Senate broadly said, Chuck Schumer being the Senate leader who voted to overturn against Elizabeth, was, enough, enough.¬†Like, this is becoming dumb. 
And so I‚Äôm sensing a¬†real¬†shift.‚Äù

Ether Futures Surge to Record Highs as Open Interest Tops $14 Billion


							

Ether futures open interest on centralized exchanges has hit a record $14 billion.



Daily open interest in Ether futures has risen 40% since early 2024.



Optimism for a spot Ether ETF approval has increased, with analysts raising SEC approval odds from 25% to 75%.




Ether‚Äôs open interest futures on centralized exchanges (CEX) have surpassed their previous highs, reflecting increased trading volume. Open interest (OI) measures the aggregated number of open positions in a particular contract, making it a key indicator of market sentiment, liquidity, and investor sentiment.



According to insights from CoinGlass, ETH Open Interest futures hit an all-time high of $14 billion on Tuesday. This marked a significant increase in the total value of all Ether‚Äôs outstanding contracts.



On a year-to-date, daily open interest in ether futures has risen 40% from its initial $10 million valuation. Equally, Ether held price gains in its previous intraday session, surging by 21% to trade at $‚ÄØ3,783, per data from Coincodex.










The major driver of this positive trend is the renewed optimism surrounding the approval of spot Ether ETFs.¬† As a result, ETF analysts, particularly Bloomberg‚Äôs James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, have revised their estimations of the SEC approving spot ether ETFs, raising their estimations from 25% to 75%. Balchunas stated:




‚ÄúUpdate: JSeyff and I are increasing our odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they‚Äôd be denied),‚Äù 




Previously, Balchunas estimated the chances of an Ether ETF approval to be 25% in March, down from 70% in January. Co-analyst Seyffart also expressed scepticism regarding the approval, pointing to inactivity from key entities before the May 23 deadline set by the SEC.



The agency requested that issuers update and resubmit Form 19b-4 documents, which require regulatory clearance before launching spot ether ETFs. In line with this, the first wave of applications is expected this week, with VanEck‚Äôs due and Ark Invest/21Shares‚Äô individual deadlines on the 23rd and 24th, respectively.

Uniswap Labs claims SEC will fail, urges agency to drop enforcement action - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Uniswap Labs has urged the SEC to drop its pending enforcement action against the company. Arguing through a response to the agency‚Äôs Wells notice, Uniswap Labs CLO Martin Ammori said that the SEC would have to redefine what an exchange is to have jurisdiction over Uniswap.The SEC‚Äôs Wells notice was issued to Uniswap Labs in April, accusing the Uniswap protocol of being an unregistered securities exchange and the interface and wallet of being unregistered securities brokers.A Wells notice is a formal notification issued by the SEC or other securities regulators to inform individuals or companies of completed investigations where infractions have been discovered. This signals the agency‚Äôs intention to recommend legal action against Uniswap as it builds its case to pursue the company for alleged violations of federal securities laws.‚ÄúThese assertions assume that value represented in a specific digital file format is a security ‚Äì and that the SEC can unilaterally extend the definitions of exchanges, brokers and contracts,‚Äù Uniswap states in the blog post published Tuesday.Uniswap Protocol, as developed by Uniswap Labs, operates the application and interface for Uniswap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built over the Ethereum blockchain.Legal contentionsAccording to Ammori, Uniswap‚Äôs legal strategy revolves around challenging the SEC‚Äôs authority to regulate the Uniswap Protocol and its associated products based on the definition of securities and exchanges.The company asserts that the majority of digital assets traded on the Uniswap Protocol do not constitute securities under federal law. Uniswap contends that the SEC has failed to provide clear guidance on which specific assets it deems to be securities, creating an atmosphere of regulatory uncertainty for DeFi projects.Uniswap also notes that the decentralized nature of the Uniswap Protocol renders it immune to the regulator‚Äôs oversight, arguing that its autonomous operation precludes the company from being held responsible for ensuring compliance with securities laws. The company maintains that, as a decentralized protocol, Uniswap is not controlled by any single entity, including Uniswap Labs itself.‚ÄúThe Protocol is not controlled by, or comprised of, any ‚Äúgroup of persons,‚Äù let alone Universal Navigation Inc. (‚ÄúUniswap Labs‚Äù or ‚ÄúLabs‚Äù). Labs initially developed the Protocol, but the Protocol is open-source and fully autonomous. Labs cannot change the Protocol‚Äôs core code,‚Äù Uniswap states in its Wells notice response.Another notable contention is with Rule 3b-16, which expands the definition of ‚Äúexchange‚Äù to include DeFi protocols. Uniswap claims that this set of proposed changes are unlawful.Uniswap says that the proposed amendments to Rule 3b-16 misinterpret the Exchange Act and thus run counter to the original intent of Congress. There‚Äôs also the contention that the proposed rule points to a violation of the separation of powers under the major questions doctrine and the non-delegation doctrine, as it represents a significant expansion of the SEC‚Äôs regulatory authority without explicit congressional approval.Uniswap argues that the proposed rule fails to provide fair notice to regulated parties, potentially infringing on the Due Process Clause of the US Constitution.The company also asserts that the proposed amendments are ‚Äúarbitrary and capricious‚Äù under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), as the SEC has not adequately justified its position or considered the potential consequences for the DeFi industry.SEC‚Äôs previous actions against UniswapIn September 2021, it was reported by Reuters that the SEC had launched an investigation into Uniswap Labs, the developer of the decentralized exchange Uniswap.According to the report, the SEC was seeking information about how investors use the Uniswap exchange and how it is marketed. The regulator‚Äôs focus appeared to be on gathering information rather than alleging any wrongdoing at the time.The news of the SEC‚Äôs investigation into Uniswap Labs came amidst increasing regulatory interest in the DeFi space. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler had previously hinted at the need for greater oversight of DeFi projects, particularly those that offer incentives or digital tokens to participants.At the time, Gensler argued that even in the absence of a central entity controlling a decentralized exchange, DeFi projects with governance structures and fees could still fall under the purview of SEC regulation. This stance signaled the agency‚Äôs intent to apply existing securities laws to the emerging DeFi ecosystem.The SEC‚Äôs investigation into Uniswap Labs followed its first enforcement action involving securities using DeFi technology in August 2021, when it charged Blockchain Credit Partners with raising $30 million through allegedly fraudulent offerings.The regulatory scrutiny faced by Uniswap Labs in 2021 foreshadowed the ongoing legal battle between the company and the SEC, which has since escalated with the recent issuance of a Wells notice.The earlier investigation and the subsequent enforcement action against Blockchain Credit Partners demonstrates the SEC‚Äôs growing interest in asserting its authority over the DeFi industry and applying securities laws to decentralized projects.Uniswap‚Äôs Wells notice response also highlighted the potential consequences of the SEC‚Äôs actions, stating that bringing a case against Uniswap would ‚Äúpush‚Äù American crypto investors to use foreign trading protocols and discourage future innovators from fostering competition and innovation in financial markets.Ammori emphasized that Uniswap Labs is prepared to litigate if necessary and is confident in its ability to win, but hopes that the SEC will recognize that its current strategy is not protecting anyone or benefiting Americans.Uniswap Labs will be represented in court by Andrew Ceresney, the SEC‚Äôs former head of enforcement. Ceresney represented Ripple in its case with the SEC. Former US solicitor general Don Verrili, who represented Grayscale in its case against the SEC, will also join Uniswap‚Äôs legal team.

SKALE Labs names veteran Andrew Saunders as its new CMO - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            SKALE Labs, the entity behind the gasless blockchain SKALE, has announced the appointment of Andrew Saunders as its Chief Marketing and Growth Officer. Saunders‚Äô previous roles include Global Head of Entertainment and Culture at Amazon, Vice President of Content Innovation and Creative at NBCUniversal, and the first CMO at Arbitrum.According to the April edition of the ‚ÄúDappRadar Games Report,‚Äù SKALE showed 197,000 unique daily active wallets last month, being the fifth largest blockchain by user activity. Despite showing the numbers, market awareness around SKALE is not keeping up with what the project is building, something Jack O‚ÄôHolleran, CEO of SKALE Labs, recognizes.‚ÄúWhen you look at DappRadar rankings, SKALE is in the top five pretty much every day in terms of unique active wallets and transaction volume. If not five, it‚Äôs in the top ten almost every single day. But then you go look at where we rank in terms of our awareness among the broader market and we‚Äôre not there in the top five or ten,‚Äù shared O‚ÄôHolleran with Crypto Briefing.¬†However, he highlights that SKALE has ‚Äúhuge awareness‚Äù among builders in crypto. ‚ÄúThat tells me that we have an amazing opportunity now to take this foundational structure and strength and developer attention and fundamentals and then drive that awareness. So I‚Äôm incredibly excited that we have our first ever CMO and the reality is you look at Andrew‚Äôs track record and what he did at Arbitrum and what he‚Äôs done at other points in his career, he is the absolute perfect person to come here and drive our awareness through the roof.‚ÄùWithout revealing too much of his playbook, Saunders explained that there are more to marketing and growth in crypto than a professional background in the sector. In other words, being a trader and an investor also plays a huge part in spreading awareness about a protocol.‚ÄúI like to consider myself a little bit of a Web 2.5 marketer. And so what you‚Äôll probably see is things that you‚Äôve seen in Web2, things that you‚Äôve seen in Web3, but them coming together in maybe non-traditional and more interesting ways. And that‚Äôs always been how I‚Äôve been,‚Äù said Saunders.Moreover, SKALE‚Äôs new Chief Marketing and Growth Officer stated that he‚Äôs fond of experimentation, as he was the first marketer to put brands on Netflix. Therefore, users can expect ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù initiatives from Saunders.Two ‚Äúluxury problems‚ÄùOne of the core characteristics related to blockchain technology is the fee concept. To send messages on a blockchain, be it a transaction or a smart contract interaction, fees must be paid to the infrastructure in use. Otherwise, validators would have no incentives to secure the network, users would be able to spam transactions and damage the network, and many other bad scenarios.Consequently, SKALE‚Äôs idea of ‚Äògasless‚Äô might rub some users the wrong way, although the network isn‚Äôt based on totally free interactions. ‚ÄúFrankly, the architecture is complicated. It‚Äôs not easy to explain. And the easiest explanation is, hey, guess what? There‚Äôs still fees being paid, but there are chain fees and not individual gas fees. So the developer can pay instead of the end user. Because if you don‚Äôt have fees, you have no economic sustainability,‚Äù stated O‚ÄôHolleran.This issue, along with the lack of awareness among crypto users, is called by SKALE Labs‚Äô CEO as ‚Äútwo luxury problems.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have amazing fundamentals, and not enough people know about us. We have amazing technology, that‚Äôs complex and difficult to message. Those are two problems that marketing solves, and that‚Äôs why Andrew‚Äôs on board.‚ÄùThe best way to solve the complexity issue is by making people focus on the products developed on top of SKALE‚Äôs infrastructure, explained Saunders. As an example, he mentions mainstream games available on the Epic Games marketplace, which offers high-quality games and players are not interested in knowing which engine was used to develop them.‚ÄúI‚Äôm not seeing any of this on the backend. I‚Äôm just playing the game, and it‚Äôs operating. It‚Äôs never crashing,‚Äù added Saunders. By offering seamless experiences like this one, the gasless discussion becomes obsolete.

Fantasy.Top Creators to Receive Nearly 600 ETH in Rewards - The Defiant

Heroes featured in the on-chain trading card game have collectively earned almost 600 ETH, but not everyone is happy.
Fantasy.Top, the trading card and fantasy sports hybrid built on Ethereum Layer 2 Blast, has just distributed its second round of in-game rewards to creators.Creators are set to receive 600 ETH worth of rewards by May 24. Creators are now able to claim their share of ETH royalties, Blast Gold, which is akin to Blast points, and Fantasy Stars, an in-game reward with a currently unknown use case.Creators in the Fantasy.Top ecosystem, known as heroes, earn royalties and other in-game rewards based on their card‚Äôs performance and trading volume.Fantasy Top TweetThe first round of creator royalties was distributed on May 6, and a window has now opened from May 21 to May 23 for Heroes to claim their rewards.Fantasy.Top founder Travis Bickle said ‚ÄúWe want to match the on-chain claim with an option for heroes to share their rewards granularly with their card holders‚Äù in an interview.Heroes are entitled to a 1.5% fee of trading volume on their card, and a split of 10% of the total mint revenues. Total trading fees have been volatile, but have declined by over 50% between May 13 to May 19. Minting fees have declined drastically since Fantasy.Top‚Äôs inaugural week, seeing a drop of over 90% since May 7. If these trends continue the accrual of Hero royalties is also expected to slow down.Fantasy.Top is currently one of the top 15 revenue generating dApps in DeFi over the last 30 days. The protocol has amassed $12.2m in fees and revenue since its launch day on May 1, solidifying it as the highest earning Blast-native dApp at this time.Daily Minting and Trading FeesDespite earning ETH royalties, Blast Gold, and in-game rewards, some creators have voiced concerns over the lack of clarity on both the scoring algorithm and rewards distributions.Well known investor Gmoney said ‚Äúmy unsolicited advice for @fantasy_top_ is to make how scoring is calculated public so people can base decisions on knowing who gets what‚Ä¶‚Äù.Bickle responded with a quote tweet from May 17, where he said ‚Äúwe will probably disclose more information on how the score gets calculated‚Äù once they have settled on their preferred scoring models.

Tom Emmer Opposes 'Un-American' CBDC 'Used Like The Chinese Use The Digital Yuan' - Benzinga

Representative Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) on Tuesday voiced strong opposition to the potential implementation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in the United States without stringent Congressional oversight and adherence to fundamental American values.What Happened: In an interview with Bloomberg, Emmer emphasized the critical need for any proposed CBDC to be open, permissionless, and private, aligning with the freedoms enjoyed by traditional cash.Emmer‚Äôs stance comes at a time when discussions around CBDCs are intensifying globally, with countries like China already advancing their digital currency projects. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt have that in this country. That‚Äôs un-American,‚Äù Emmer said, referencing the Chinese government‚Äôs use of digital yuan as a surveillance tool, which monitors citizens‚Äô purchases and behavior to build social scores.The Congressman underscored the potential risks associated with a government-issued digital currency that does not protect individual privacy and freedom. ‚ÄúAny digital currency issued by the government must be open, permissionless and private,‚Äù Emmer insisted. ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be used like the Chinese are using the digital yuan.‚ÄùAlso Read: Diamonds As Digital Currency? How This Innovation Could Revolutionize PaymentsWhy It Matters: Emmer‚Äôs bill, currently on the floor, mandates that the federal government must seek authorization from Congress before creating a CBDC.This legislation aims to ensure that any digital currency introduced will not infringe on the privacy rights of American citizens. The bill specifies that such a currency must emulate the characteristics of cash, preserving anonymity and preventing governmental overreach.The proposal has garnered attention amid broader regulatory debates concerning digital assets. Emmer‚Äôs emphasis on maintaining privacy and preventing surveillance aligns with growing concerns about the balance between innovation and regulation in the digital currency space.What‚Äôs Next: As the debate continues, industry leaders, investors, and policymakers are set to converge at Benzinga‚Äôs Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.The event will provide a platform to discuss the implications of regulatory decisions on digital assets, including the potential impact of CBDCs on the financial system.Read Next: EXCLUSIVE: Ethereum ETFs Could Drive ‚ÄòMass Adoption‚Äô ‚Äî What Investors Need To Know NowImage: Shutterstock

                        Hong Kong police arrested on Tuesday three individuals linked¬†to a fraud syndicate that allegedly defrauded at least 10 residents out of HK$5.1 million (US$653,900) through fake virtual investment talk tickets.Authorities revealed that the victims were deceived into bidding for fake tickets to a virtual investment talk show with the intention of reselling them for a profit.Hong Kong Police Arrest Three in Fake Virtual Investment Seminar Ticket Scam
Police reported that the syndicate invited targets to an investment seminar at a grade-A office in Kowloon Bay. The scammers lured the attendees into a fraud scheme with promises of high returns and no risk, bidding on admission tickets for an investment talk show through a sham trading platform controlled by the syndicate.Acting Superintendent Man Cheuk-hei of the Sau Mau Ping district stated that the scammers persuaded the victims to deposit money into a bogus trading platform, promising a monthly return of 7% interest.¬†The syndicate, which began operations in November 2022, faces charges of conspiracy to defraud, which carries a potential prison sentence of up to 14 years. Police seized five mobile phones and cash amounting to HK$15,000 and 30,000 yuan (US$4,145).Inspector Tam Ho-yin of the Sau Mau Ping district crime squad explained that the bidding for each ticket started at 100 Tether coins, equivalent to HK$780. Victims were told they could sell the tickets the next day at a markup of 300 Tether coins but faced high handling fees for their bids. As the bidding price increased, the fraudsters claimed they would eventually repurchase all tickets at an inflated price of 15,000 Tether coins.‚ÄúThe money supposedly won by the victims during this process belonged to other victims,‚Äù Tam said. Some victims, who made profits, introduced their family and friends to the scheme. The trading platform ceased operations when the syndicate could not find new targets, leaving those who remained with substantial losses.Tam added that when victims tried to withdraw money, scammers made excuses and refused. Fraudsters even demanded exorbitant administrative fees before processing any requests. Notably, the police urged other potential victims to come forward.¬†Hong Kong SFC and Police Force Partner to Combat Crypto Scams
Hong Kong has seen a major rise in fraud cases, with a 42.6 percent increase in reports last year, totaling 39,824 cases compared to 27,923 in 2022. Financial losses from these cases surged by 89 percent, reaching HK$9.1 billion in 2023, up from HK$4.8 billion the previous year.In response to the growing number of scams in Hong Kong‚Äôs cryptocurrency space, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Police Force have partnered to tackle the issue. The collaboration was solidified during their meeting on September 28. The primary objective of this newly established group is to monitor unlawful activities associated with virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) within Hong Kong territory.A major catalyst for the initiative was the ongoing scrutiny of the JPEX exchange, the biggest fraud case in Hong Kong‚Äôs history. Accusations have surfaced that JPEX was advertising its services without securing the necessary license from the SFC. The oversight and other illicit activities allegedly resulted in losses of approximately $166 million, affecting over 2,086 investors.To prevent individuals from falling victim to scams involving bogus and unlicensed crypto platforms, the SFC has made public a list of licenses, encompassing unlicensed and suspect VATPs and those on the verge of shutting down. The list also features VATPs currently awaiting SFC approval.

DOGE To The Moon: Dogecoin Beats Out Cardano And XRP In This Major Metric | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin (DOGE) has come out on top over Cardano and XRP following a recent development highlighting each token‚Äôs growth. This could reflect positively on the meme coin‚Äôs price soon enough, given how much crypto users look to be invested in the crypto token.¬†¬†
Dogecoin Experiences The Second-Largest Network Growth
Data from the market intelligence platform Santiment shows that Dogecoin has experienced the second-largest network growth in the past six months. Currently, 6.6 million wallets are said to be holding the meme coin, representing a 27% growth over this period. DOGE is only behind Toncoin (TON), which has recorded a 110% growth over the last six months, with 16,800 wallets holding the crypto token.¬†

Meanwhile, Dogecoin topped other major cap crypto tokens, with XRP and Cardano recording 7% and 0% network growth, respectively. The meme coin also surpassed the foremost crypto tokens, Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have grown 10% and 11% in the last six months, respectively.¬†
Dogecoin‚Äôs network growth is expected to reflect positively on DOGE‚Äôs price since many crypto users are adopting the meme coin. This will likely trigger significant price surges for Dogecoin as these investors continue to accumulate the crypto token. The increased interest in Dogecoin isn‚Äôt surprising, given that meme coins are one of the leading narratives for this bull run.
Therefore, these investors are likely positioning themselves with DOGE, as the foremost meme coin, expected to gain massively from the meme coin hype. DOGE has so far enjoyed a year-to-date (YTD) of over 77% but looks to be still far from achieving its full potential, with crypto analysts like Ali Martinez predicting that it can rise to $1 in this market cycle.¬†¬†
Dogecoin‚Äôs fundamentals are also as bullish as ever, with the meme coin set to gain more utility. Automotive company Tesla recently integrated DOGE payments to purchase specific merchandise on its website. Meanwhile, there continue to be rumors that Dogecoin will likely be integrated into X payments due to Elon Musk‚Äôs fondness for the meme coin.¬†
DOGE‚Äôs Outlook On The Chart Is Bullish
Crypto analyst Kevin Capital (formerly Yomi OG) recently provided a bullish outlook for Dogecoin from a technical analysis perspective. He revealed in an X post that Dogecoin is about to receive a 2-month MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) cross to the upside for the second time in history.¬†

Source: Santiment
The crypto analyst mentioned that Dogecoin began a ‚Äúmassive bull market to $0.74‚Äù the last time this happened. This raises the possibility of the meme coin rising even higher this time around. In the meantime, DOGE¬†looks headed for $0.22 as Kevin Capital revealed that the crypto token is breaking out of a head and shoulders pattern, which could send it to this price level.

Economist Alex Kr√ºger Says ‚ÄòBase Case‚Äô Is Ethereum at New All-Time Highs, Bitcoin Much Higher by Year End - The Daily Hodl


								Closely followed trader and economist Alex Kr√ºger believes Ethereum (ETH) is headed to new all-time highs (ATHs) due to one key catalyst.
Kr√ºger tells his 175,400 followers on the social media platform X that a possible approval of a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) as early as this week could send the top altcoin soaring.










The odds for an ETH ETF approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suddenly increased this week, and ETH rallied by more than 20% in the past day.
He also believes Bitcoin (BTC) will be ‚Äúmuch higher‚Äù before the end of 2024.
‚ÄúMy base case scenario has been: 

Bitcoin much higher into year-end. 
Ethereum underperforming due to an ETF rejection. 
Ethereum over-performing from the US elections onwards, as elections would lead to a [SEC Chair Gary] Gensler removal and subsequent ETF approval in 2025. 

An ETH ETF approval this week would push everything forward. [May 21st‚Äôs] move was just the market repositioning and shorts closing (see open interest chart below), as almost nobody had been expecting an approval. Then would come the inflows, which would push ETH into ATHs. Do not fade an approval. It is not even remotely priced in. The market would likely shift back into ‚Äòyou really are a genius mode.‚Äô With ETH leading for a while. Even after today ETH/BTC is still red year-to-date. Time for it to continue much higher. 
Note: even if now unlikely, if the ETF gets rejected, we are in for a world of pain. Keep alerts on during US hours until the 23rd.‚Äù
Source: Alex Kr√ºger/X
Ethereum is trading for $3,809 at time of writing, up more than 22% in the last 24 hours. ETH reached its ATH of about $4,900 in November 2021.
Kr√ºger suspects the SEC is facing political pressure to approve the ETH ETF applications due to the politics around the US presidential election in November.
‚ÄúMany will disagree but I do believe the SEC‚Äôs seeming change in stance was politically driven, coming from the top of the Democratic party and with elections in mind. Possibly triggered by Trump‚Äôs sudden support of crypto, forcing the Dems hands.‚Äù

Another Blow to the SEC? Harsh Statements from Altcoin Under Threat of Lawsuit - Bitcoin Sistemi

Uniswap Labs, the company behind the largest decentralized crypto exchange Ethereum, has called on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to drop its planned lawsuit against them, arguing that the fight is not worth it.
In April, Uniswap Labs received a Wells notice from the SEC, a warning that the regulator believed the company was violating the law. In the notice, the Uniswap protocol was accused of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, while its interface and wallet were accused of being an unregistered securities broker.


In response to the SEC's Wells notice, Uniswap Labs disputed these allegations. The company argues that the protocol does not meet the definition of an exchange and is therefore not subject to SEC regulation. Although Uniswap Labs developed the protocol, it argues that the protocol is now a ‚Äúpassive‚Äù technology used for cryptocurrency trading.
Uniswap Labs Chief Legal Officer Martin Ammori stated that the SEC must redefine the concept of an exchange to have jurisdiction over Uniswap. According to the current definition, Uniswap should have been designed specifically for securities trading. ‚ÄúIt is general purpose and the majority of its volume consists of non-security assets such as Ethereum, Bitcoin and stablecoins,‚Äù Ammori said, noting that these assets constitute 65% of the protocol's transaction volume.






Ammori also pointed out that the SEC's current exchange definition does not include any of Uniswap Labs' products. He explained that the SEC is currently trying to redefine several terms in its regulations to try to catch them, and that he believes this move exceeds the authority given to the SEC by Congress.
Additionally, Ammori rejected the SEC's claim that Uniswap's interface and wallet are brokers, citing a recent federal court decision rejecting the SEC's claim that Coinbase Wallet is an unregistered securities broker.

Uniswap responds to SEC Wells notice, says litigation is not the path forward - Blockworks


DeFi platform Uniswap Labs responded on Tuesday to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had notified the company last month that enforcement actions were imminent.
In a 43-page submission, Uniswap made its case to the SEC on why the regulator should not take legal action against them. Uniswap last month revealed it has been served a Wells notice, which typically precedes an SEC enforcement action.¬†
Uniswap is not an exchange, the company stated in its response to the SEC. It emphasized that the SEC lacks the authority to regulate bitcoin, ether or stablecoins, which are the primary assets traded on the Uniswap protocol.
Read more: SEC signals to Uniswap that enforcement actions are looming
Uniswap argued that tokens traded on its platform are not securities but rather alternative assets such as stablecoins, community and utility tokens, and commodities. Uniswap also pointed out that ‚Äî per its decentralized nature ‚Äî the protocol does not maintain user accounts or collect personal data, complicating the SEC‚Äòs push for increased transparency and regulatory oversight‚Äã.
‚ÄúBringing this case would encourage Americans to use harder-to-regulate foreign interfaces and trading protocols, while also discouraging future innovators from attempting to foster new ideas that bring much needed competition and innovation to financial and commercial markets,‚Äù Uniswap wrote in the submission.¬†
Uniswap added that Congressional intervention is needed to regulate the crypto industry, and the SEC ‚Äúcannot obtain its desired answers through litigation.‚Äù¬†

Uniswap‚Äôs response comes a month after Consensys preemptively sued the SEC after receiving its own Wells notice. In the suit, the crypto company alleges the securities regulator overstepped its authority and failed to provide regulatory clarity for the industry.¬†
Consensys claims the SEC has been investigating Ethereum and ether‚Äôs potential status as a security for over a year. The crypto firm claims that SEC director of the division of enforcement Gurbir Grewal in March 2023 approved a Formal Order of Investigation into the buying and selling of ether. Formal Orders allow the agency to issue subpoenas and collect witness testimony under oath.
Uniswap‚Äôs response also follows news that exchange Robinhood was served a Wells notice earlier this month. The US securities regulator is interested in Robinhood Crypto‚Äôs ‚Äúcryptocurrency listings, custody of cryptocurrencies, and platform operations,‚Äù in addition to ‚Äúother topics.‚Äù¬†
‚ÄúThe potential action may involve a civil injunctive action, public administrative proceeding, and/or a cease-and-desist proceeding and may seek remedies that include an injunction, a cease-and-desist order, disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, civil money penalties, and censure, revocation, and limitations on activities,‚Äù Robinhood said earlier this month.¬†
The SEC has declined to comment on both Uniswap and Robinhood‚Äôs Wells notices and any pending enforcement actions.

Uniswap Hits Back at SEC, Says It's Ready to Fight in Court


Decentralized exchange giant Uniswap has filed its¬†response to the Wells notice it recently received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.¬†Uniswap has accused the agency of attempting to significantly expand its jurisdiction so that it covers all digital value. According to Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams, the SEC wants to become "the world internet police.""This SEC‚Äôs reckless approach to crypto has not protected consumers and has caused immeasurable harm in the US - to individuals, businesses, and the state itself. We should lead on internet innovation, not stifle it," Adams said.¬†Uniswap claims that it is not required to be registered as a broker. It has predicted that the SEC's authority over technology will be further narrowed due to its decision to litigate this issue.¬†The defendant insists that the underlying transactions on the protocol are not securities transactions, comparing Uniswap to Coinbase Wallet. In March, U.S. District Judge Katherine Failla ruled that the latter was not conducting brokerage activities.Furthermore, Uniswap claims that it does not solicit users to perform swaps on the protocol, adding that its general public statements do not amount to solicitation. In addition, the defendant has stated that it does not provide advice to the users of the protocol or the interface.¬†Uniswap neither acts as a depository nor engages in clearing activity, according to its response. The SEC suggested that Uniswap's contracts serve as depositories for securities.¬†The distribution of the native UNI token was also addressed in the lawsuit, with Uniswap stating that it does not satisfy the requirements of the Howey test in order to be recognized as a securities offering.¬†Adams has stated that Uniswap is "ready to fight" the SEC in court. As¬†reported by U.Today, it was sued by the agency in April.¬†¬†

Surprising Predictions from Bloomberg Analyst: "Ethereum ETF Approvals Will Be Nothing Like Bitcoin ETFs" - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) recent interaction with potential spot Ethereum ETF applicant companies represents a significant shift in the outlook for potential approvals.
Next steps include approving forms 19b-4 and S-1 registration statements. Balchunas noted that due to the unique nature of the issue, this may take longer than usual. Once these are met, trading can begin.


‚ÄúOvercoming the possible approval issue is the most important thing. Now it's all about logistics and legal documents,‚Äù he said.
Unlike spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, where the SEC meets with prospective issuers for weeks before finalizing the forms, the SEC began meeting with prospective Ethereum ETF issuers just days before the May 23 deadline for a final decision on the VanEck Ethereum ETF.





Despite the time constraint, Balchunas believes the process should be made easier. ‚ÄúThey just completed the Bitcoin process a few months ago, so there will be a lot of copy and paste,‚Äù he said.
In the Bitcoin ETF process, issuers like BlackRock have launched spot Bitcoin ETFs with $10 million in seed capital, with billions of dollars of capital reportedly lined up. But Balchunas doubts that will be the case with Ethereum ETFs, in part because the SEC stepped in at the last minute.


‚ÄúEveryone was pretty optimistic during the Bitcoin ETF process, so they had time. That's not the case right now,‚Äù he said. However, he did not rule out that BlackRock could do something quickly.

Balchunas also reiterated his view that Ethereum ETFs may see lower demand than Bitcoin ETFs. ‚ÄúThe people who are really interested in this probably already have ETH. And for the casual tourist types, a lot of them are probably happy with Bitcoin. It's what they know best,‚Äù he said.





The analyst estimates that Ethereum ETFs could receive 10 to 15% of the assets that their Bitcoin counterparts receive, which would bring the ETFs to around $5 billion to $8 billion. ‚ÄúFor any normal launch in the first few years, that's pretty good,‚Äù he concluded.

Pro-Crypto Bills Vote: House Democrat Leaders Say "No Whip"


								Recent reports revealed that Democratic Party leaders have opted not to whip the coming vote on two pro-crypto bills. This seemingly positive development comes alongside the recent 180-degree turn the Biden administration appears to be taking on cryptocurrencies.

House Democrat Representatives Don‚Äôt Have To Vote No
According to an email shared by Politico, Democratic Party leaders did not urge its members to vote against two pro-crypto bills expected to be brought up to the House of Representatives floor soon.
The Whip Question revealed that Democratic leaders expect bills H. R. 4763 and H. R. 5403 to come to the floor this week. As a result, they have presented their issues with the bills despite not forcing the House Democrats to vote against them.
Bill H. R. 476, or Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act, would provide a new regulatory framework for the industry. If passed, FIT21 would establish the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the primary regulator of cryptocurrencies and clarify whether a digital asset is a security or a commodity.
Per the email, Democrat leaders consider that the bill includes language that ‚Äúundermines decades of legal precedent and case law, thereby creating uncertainty in our traditional securities market.‚Äù
FIT21 would allegedly also provide a ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù for entities that would ‚Äúshield them from SEC rules and regulations until SEC and CFTC finalize their rules,‚Äù effectively ‚Äúweakening‚Äù investors‚Äô protections against fraud and market manipulation.
Regarding the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, or bill H.R. 5403, the Democratic Party considers that it would ‚Äúhave broad negative consequences.‚Äù The impact includes ‚Äúhampering the primacy of the U.S. dollar,‚Äù and undermining ‚Äúthe Fed‚Äôs ability to conduct monetary policy.‚Äù
Due to this, Ranking Members Maxine Waters and David Scott strongly oppose the legislation, releasing a ‚ÄúDear Colleague‚Äù letter on FIT21 specifically and urging Democrat House Representatives to vote ‚Äúno.‚Äù
It‚Äôs worth noting that the American Bankers Association (ABA) urged House Representatives to back up bill H.R. 5403. On Monday, ABA published a letter supporting the bill.
The association believes a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is unnecessary and ‚Äúwould present unacceptable risks and costs to the financial system.‚Äù Additionally, ABA argues that it would fundamentally alter the relationship between citizens and the Federal Reserve, undermining ‚Äúthe important role banks play in financial intermediation.‚Äù
Politico journalist Eleanor Mueller revealed that the floor debate and passage of the bills are allegedly set for Wednesday, May 22.
Is The US Gov‚Äôt Shifting On Crypto Regulations?
The US government‚Äôs crackdown on cryptocurrencies has created an unclear and uncertain landscape for the crypto industry. Moreover, the strict and sometimes ‚Äúoverreaching‚Äù approach against the sector has been strongly criticized by important figures in the community and politicians.
Government scrutiny intensifies as the November elections approach. This has seemingly prompted Biden‚Äôs administration to pivot to a more strategic approach to crypto.
As reported by Bitcoinist, experts consider this change could be a response to Trump‚Äôs endorsement of cryptocurrencies. The Republican candidate and former president has received a positive response from the crypto community for supporting digital assets.
Moreover, the pressure from the community and key political figures, who have asked for clearer regulations and a more welcoming landscape, has put the US government ‚Äúon the defensive,‚Äù as Riot Platform‚Äôs Director of Public Policy Sam Lyman highlighted.
Ultimately, the industry‚Äôs efforts should continue despite the recent victories. CoinRoutes Chair Dave Weisberger said, ‚ÄúIt is NOT time to be complacent.‚Äù

Analyst Says $71,000 Bitcoin Move Is Only Halfway Through, Here's Why


																An analyst has explained how the current Bitcoin surge appears to have hit the halfway completion mark if this indicator is to go by.
Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator Suggests BTC Rally Only Halfway Done
In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has posted an update for how the Bitcoin Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator is looking like after the latest rally.
The VWAP is an indicator that, as its full form suggests, calculates an average price for the cryptocurrency based on not just the changes in the price over the day but also the volume that was traded at these prices.

	Related Reading



Normally, this volume is measured using the spot volume data provided by centralized exchanges. Still, in the case of Bitcoin, the blockchain is available for anyone to explore, so on-chain volume is used to calculate the VWAP instead.
The VWAP Oscillator, which is the actual metric of interest here, takes the ratio between the cryptocurrency‚Äôs spot price and the VWAP and represents it as an oscillator around zero.
Earlier in the month, Woo had pointed out how the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator was forming a bullish divergence for the asset.
How the VWAP Oscillator looked like earlier in the month | Source: @woonomic on X
As is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator climbed up inside the negative territory after forming an apparent bottom back then. At the same time, the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price had been heading down instead.
In the past, such a setup has proven to be bullish for the coin, and the resulting bullish momentum usually lasts until the VWAP Oscillator tops out in positive territory. As such, the analyst remarked that the coin had a lot of room to run back then.
Since then, the price has experienced a recovery rally, potentially suggesting that the bullish divergence may be paying off. As Woo pointed out, the indicator has returned to the neutral mark after this run.
It looks like the value of the metric is making a break into the positive territory | Source: @woonomic on X
Based on the fact that tops in the past have occurred after the metric peaks in the positive territory and based on the scale of these peaks usually, the analyst concludes, ‚Äúthis Bitcoin move is now at the halfway mark.‚Äù

As for how things could play out next, the analyst says,
Consolidation under all-time-high needs to happen for a little, then we see if the second leg gives us escape velocity to new highs which will open up the flood gates.
Woo has also shared a ‚Äúrisk signal‚Äù for Bitcoin, which shows where the asset is when looking at the bigger picture.
The data for the BTC risk signal over the last few years | Source: @woonomic on X
BTC may be in that part of the cycle where risk begins to drive up as price reacts violently to capital inflows. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where most of the fast gains happen,‚Äù notes the analyst.
BTC Price
Bitcoin had recovered above $71,000 earlier in the day, but the asset appears to have seen a pullback since then, as it‚Äôs now back below $70,000.

Billionaire CEO Mike Novogratz Speaks Out: Why Did the SEC Change Its Mind? How Will Prices Be Affected? - Bitcoin Sistemi

There is said to be a significant change in the Democratic Party's stance on cryptocurrency, especially Ethereum ETFs. According to Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, this change has completely turned the Ethereum ETF world upside down.
‚ÄúI feel like someone from the Biden White House called and said, 'Guys, we can't be the anti-crypto side anymore,'‚Äù Novogratz told CNBC. said. This announcement comes after months of silence from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is now frantically communicating with potential ETF issuers, including Galaxy Digital, to get the products ready before a key May 23 deadline.


Rumors of this step back have already had a significant impact on the market, with Ethereum rising 20% since the news first emerged. Novogratz believes that if the SEC's change of heart is politically motivated, ‚Äúthis is a seismic shift‚Äù and ‚Äúprices will be much higher from here.‚Äù
While prominent members of the Democratic Party, particularly Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, have long criticized crypto, Republicans are generally more sympathetic to the sector. The difference in approach has become particularly evident in the past few weeks, with former President Donald Trump, who has historically been skeptical of cryptocurrency, recently stated that he would support the industry if re-elected.





In response, President Joe Biden threatened to veto a proposal to repeal SAB 121, a controversial crypto finance rule, despite bipartisan support. Less than six months before they face each other in the US presidential election, the standoff between the two politicians has ‚Äúcreated a ring of fire‚Äù, according to Novogratz.
With Trump leading Biden in the polls and crypto companies raising over $150 million to support pro-industry candidates, sometimes in swing states, Novogratz said Democrats' aversion to crypto is becoming less and less plausible.



‚ÄúIt was Elizabeth Warren and a small group of people who literally took the Democrats hostage on this issue,‚Äù said Novogratz, adding that Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who voted for the repeal of SAB 121, probably told Warren ‚Äúenough, this is getting stupid.‚Äù he added.
‚ÄúThere is no reason to make crypto, a technology, a political issue,‚Äù Novogratz added.

                        In a major development in the crypto space, blockchain investigator ZachXBT identified seven wallet addresses on May 21 containing 891.13 Bitcoin, worth approximately $61 million, linked to the infamous North Korean hacking group Lazarus.ZachXBT¬†shared these findings on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting the ongoing threat posed by the state-backed hacker group.¬†The revelation follows the investigator‚Äôs previous research, which led to the authorities freezing $3.8 million in digital assets.ZachXBT identifies Seven More Addresses Linked to Lazarus¬†
As of the latest updates, the flagged wallets still hold the amounts identified by ZachXBT.¬†The usernames ‚ÄúEasyGoatfish351‚Äù and ‚ÄúFairJunco470‚Äù were noted explicitly for their deposits and trading volumes, which matched the stolen funds.¬†The stolen assets were often exchanged into Tether (USDT) before being converted to fiat and withdrawn.Lazarus Group, known for its cyber heists, resurfaced earlier this year after a period of inactivity.¬†On January 8,¬†they moved $1.2 million in stolen digital assets from a mixer to an inactive wallet, involving two transfers totaling 27.37 Bitcoin. Subsequently, 3.343 BTC worth $150,582 was sent to a previously used address. The group also employed social engineering tactics, using¬†LinkedIn to target vulnerable users with malware attacks. Blockchain security firm Slowmist flagged these attacks, noting that the hackers pretended to apply for blockchain developer jobs to gain access to confidential employee credentials.Over $200 Million Laundered By North Korean Hacking Group Lazarus
The discovery of seven more addresses comes after an in-depth analysis published by ZachXBT on April 29, detailing how Lazarus laundered $200 million from over 25 hacks since 2020.¬†The investigation revealed that the group orchestrated over 25 exploits across various blockchains, using crypto-mixing services and peer-to-peer marketplaces to obscure the origins of the stolen funds.¬†The Lazarus Group, infamous for its hacking activities since 2009, reportedly stole over $3 billion in crypto assets over the six years leading up to 2023, directly and indirectly impacting thousands of individuals.¬†The laundered funds were primarily converted into USDT stablecoin before being exchanged for fiat currencies, often through over-the-counter traders in China.¬†Notably, $44 million of the stolen cryptocurrency was laundered through Paxful and Noones P2P marketplaces using specific usernames. In response, Tether blacklisted over $374,000 worth of stolen funds linked to the group, and other stablecoin issuers blacklisted an additional $3.4 million.The¬†United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and DeFiLlama data indicate North Korea has been involved in $2.4 billion worth of crypto heists since 2020, with a significant portion attributed to compromised private keys.Despite the increased hacking activity by North Korean groups in 2023, they stole $700 million less than in 2022.¬†The reduction in losses might reflect improved project security and market conditions. Experts warn that hacking activity could surge again with favorable market conditions and the continued expansion of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, however.

Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin Warns Against Rushing Into ‚ÄòVery Risky‚Äô Superintelligent AI - Decrypt

Vitalik Buterin, the mastermind behind Ethereum, called for a more cautious approach to AI research, calling the current forward frenzy "very risky." Responding to a critique of OpenAI and its leadership by Ryan Selkis‚ÄîCEO of crypto intelligence firm Messari‚Äîthe creator of the world's second most influential blockchain outlined his views on AI alignment‚Äîthe core principles that should drive development."Superintelligent AI is very risky, and we should not rush into it, and we should push against people who try,‚Äù Buterin asserted. ‚ÄúNo $7 trillion server farms, please.‚ÄùSuperintelligent AI is a theoretical form of artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence in virtually all domains. While many see artificial general intelligence (AGI) as the final realization of the emerging technology's full potential, superintelligent models would be what comes next. While today‚Äôs state-of-the-art AI systems have not yet reached these thresholds, advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and other AI-related technologies continue to progress‚Äîand people are by turns excited and worried.After Messari tweeted that "AGI is too important for us to deify another smooth-talking narcissist,‚Äù Buterin emphasized the importance of a diverse AI ecosystem to avoid a world where the immense value of AI is owned and controlled by very few people.‚ÄúA strong ecosystem of open models running on consumer hardware [is] an important hedge to protect against a future where value captured by AI is hyper-concentrated and most human thought becomes read and mediated by a few central servers controlled by a few people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSuch models are also much lower in terms of doom risk than both corporate megalomania and militaries."The Ethereum creator has been closely following the AI scene, recently praising the open-source LLM Llama3 model. He also suggested that OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o multimodal LLM could have passed the Turing test after a study argued that human responses were indistinguishable from those generated by the AI.Buterin also addressed the categorization of AI models into "small" and "large" groups, with the focus on regulation of "large" models being a reasonable priority. However, he expressed concern that many current proposals could result in everything being classified as "large" over time.Buterin's remarks come amid heated debates surrounding AI alignment and the resignations of key figures in OpenAI's super alignment research team. Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike have left the company, with Leike accusing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman of prioritizing "shiny products'' over responsible AI development.It was separately revealed that OpenAI has stringent non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that prevent its employees from discussing the company after their departure.High-level, long-view debates about super intelligent are turning more urgent, with experts expressing concern while making widely varying recommendations.Paul Christiano, who formerly led the language model alignment team at OpenAI, has established the Alignment Research Center, a non-profit organization dedicated to aligning AI and machine learning systems with "human interests." As reported by Decrypt, Christiano suggested that there could be a "50/50 chance of catastrophe shortly after we have systems at the human level."On the other hand, Yann LeCun, Meta's chief researcher, believes that such a catastrophic scenario is highly unlikely. Back in April 2023, he stated in a tweet, that the "hard take-off" scenario is "utterly impossible." LeCun asserted that short-term AI developments significantly influence the way AI evolves, shaping its long-term trajectory.Buterin, instead, thinks of himself as a centrist. In an essay from 2023 ‚Äîwhich he ratified today‚Äî he recognized that "it seems very hard to have a "friendly" superintelligent-AI-dominated world where humans are anything other than pets," but also argued that "often, it really is the case that version N of our civilization's technology causes a problem, and version N+1 fixes it. However, this does not happen automatically, and requires intentional human effort." In other words, if superintelligence becomse an issue, humans would probably find a way to deal with that.The departure of OpenAI's more cautious alignment researchers and the company‚Äôs shifting approach to safety policies have raised broader, mainstream concerns about the lack of attention to ethical AI development among major AI startups. Indeed, Google, Meta, and Microsoft¬†have also reportedly disbanded their teams responsible for ensuring that AI is being safely developed.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Why Did the SEC Suddenly Change Its Mind on Ethereum ETFs? An Inside Source Reveals the Real Reason - Bitcoin Sistemi


The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly on the verge of approving spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This sudden change left companies trying to understand the SEC's change of attitude in a difficult situation.
Just two weeks ago, the SEC showed no interest in the filings, according to a source familiar with the matter. However, on Monday, the SEC's trading and markets division notified exchanges that they would approve 19b-4s this week. This news coincides with reports from Barrons' SEC staff indicating a trend toward approval.


The source described the situation as ‚Äúcompletely unprecedented‚Äù and suggested that this U-turn was ‚Äúpurely political‚Äù. This speculation stems from a lack of internal coordination within the SEC. While the trading and markets division is preparing to approve 19b-4s, the corporate finance division, which is responsible for S-1s, appears out of sync on this issue.

The source also speculated that the SEC's change of heart could be politically motivated, given the fast-approaching elections. Former President Donald Trump, who recently backed crypto, told a crowd of NFT buyers, ‚ÄúIf you love cryptocurrencies in any form, you better vote for Trump.‚Äù





The source believes this could become a campaign issue, especially since Democrats desperately need the youth vote. The source suggested that President Joe Biden could score a win with the approval of spot ETH ETFs and position himself as a leader going forward.
The next step involves updating the 19b-4 forms once comments are received from the SEC. Given the tight deadlines, comments on 19b-4s are expected to be light. The source emphasized the urgency of the situation, likening the SEC's efforts to ‚Äúwriting a term paper the night before the deadline.‚Äù

Fed, Bank of Japan Will Drive Bitcoin to $1 Million, Says Arthur Hayes - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Federal Reserve and Bank Of Japan will be key drivers of a Bitcoin price rally to $1 million, predicts BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, when both the central banks hit ‚Äúthe easy button‚Äù to rescue the Asian nation‚Äôs flagging currency.Hayes argued in an essay published on Monday that the dollar-yen exchange rate is ‚Äúthe most important global economic variable‚Äù right now, due to its potential to influence central bankers into ballooning the global money supply.He says the story, however, begins in China, which has the most to lose from the yen‚Äôs ongoing devaluation trend.‚ÄúIf the CNYJPY exchange rate rises (weaker JPY vs. stronger CNY), China‚Äôs export competitiveness is hurt,‚Äù Hayes wrote. ‚ÄúIf the yen keeps weakening, China will respond by devaluing the yuan.‚ÄùSince a country‚Äôs local goods are denominated in its local currency, a fast-inflating currency is good for countries that rely on exports to keep their economy moving.Unfortunately for China, Japan is its biggest competitor in the automotive export market, and as the yen becomes increasingly cheap, Japan is difficult to compete with on prices.Hayes expects the Bank of China to pressure the United States into making Japan strengthen the yen. Even so, he writes that the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) will have trouble strengthening its currency through traditional methods like raising interest rates.‚ÄúThe BOJ would meltdown faster than Sam Bankman-Fried on a witness stand if they were to raise rates,‚Äù Hayes wrote, explaining that doing so would crater the value of Japanese government bonds which are 50% owned by the central bank itself.To keep bonds from collapsing, the BOJ would have to force local banks and pension funds to buy the government‚Äôs debt, Hayes said. Funding that purchase would require selling US Treasuries and US stocks, however‚Äîwhich would run against American interests.Hayes concludes that instead of raising rates, the BOJ must resort to ‚Äúthe easy button‚Äù: the unlimited US dollar ‚Äúswap line‚Äù where the BOJ and Federal Reserve can swap yen for dollars at a specified rate.Since the BOJ can freely print more yen, their cost of gaining more dollars is effectively zero. Those dollars may then be used to buy up the yen, strengthening Japan‚Äôs currency while simultaneously weakening the dollar.The final scenario would be a win for all parties: China maintains a weaker currency than Japan, the BOJ stays solvent, and the dollar weakens because of the BOJ‚Äôs open-market yen purchases.It‚Äôs also good for crypto since environments with lots of money printing tend to drive up Bitcoin‚Äôs price alongside other assets, Hayes argued.‚ÄúWhen something is done about the weak yen, I will mathematically guestimate how flows into the Bitcoin complex will ratchet the price to $1 million and possibly beyond,‚Äù the investor wrote.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

$300,000 Withdrawal at JPMorgan Chase Instantly Stolen at Bank Branch in Brooklyn: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A JPMorgan Chase customer reportedly lost $300,000 at a bank branch in Brooklyn immediately after withdrawing the cash.
The 31 year-old customer withdrew the huge sum from a teller and was robbed once he exited the bank‚Äôs front door, reports News 12.










Although the bank has not released a statement on the assault, it provided security footage from the branch showing the alleged robber, which authorities have now made public.
Source: NYPD / Crime Stoppers
Police say the suspect ‚Äúforcibly removed‚Äù the cash from the customer and rode away on a scooter.
Chase has not said whether it will reimburse the victim and the customer has not made any public statements on the incident, which happened last month.
The New York Police Department is asking anyone with information on what happened to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS.
Last year, Chase made headlines over new safety measures in New York City.
Amid a surge in crime, the banking giant said a ‚Äúsmall number‚Äù of its ATMs in NYC would be switched off by 6:00 p.m. ‚Äúdue to rising crime and vagrancy that occurred in these previously 24/7 vestibules.‚Äù

Galaxy Digital Exec: This Is How the SEC Could Classify ETH as Security


																Alex Thorn, the Head of Research at Galaxy Research, speculated that the SEC could differentiate between Ethereum (ETH) and staked Ether, possibly classifying the latter as a security.
He noted that this distinction could provide a regulatory loophole for approving spot Ethereum ETFs.
Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Loophole
In a May 21 post on X, he stated, ‚ÄúIf the speculation about a 180 from SEC on the Ethereum ETFs is true, I would guess they try to thread a needle between ‚ÄòETH‚Äô NOT being a security and ‚Äòstaked ETH‚Äô (or even more flimsily, ‚Äòstaking as a service ETH‚Äô) as BEING a security.‚Äù


This potential distinction could have implications for spot Ethereum ETFs, which the SEC has been reluctant to approve so far. According to Thorn, this shift would align with the SEC‚Äôs ongoing legal battles and investigations, enabling it to approve spot Ethereum ETFs while maintaining consistency with its previous arguments and positions.




However, Thorn also highlights that this approach might involve specific restrictions on spot Ethereum ETFs. He suggested that the SEC might prohibit ETFs from staking the ETH they hold.
By distinguishing between ETH and staked ETH, the SEC could allow for the introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs while maintaining a strict regulatory framework around staked assets and other altcoins.
SEC Approval Optimism
Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their predicted likelihood of a spot Ether ETF approval from 25% to 75% on Monday. This change followed discussions suggesting that the SEC might adopt a more favorable stance towards these applications.


In a May 20 post on X, Balchunas hinted that the SEC‚Äôs increased pace toward approving the ETF could be influenced by political pressure, contrasting with the agency‚Äôs previous lack of engagement with ETF applicants.
The analysts later clarified that their increased odds only apply to 19b-4 approvals, with the SEC‚Äôs decision on the VanEck spot Ether ETF anticipated on May 23. ‚ÄúWe also need S-1 approvals. It could be weeks to months before we see S-1 approvals and thus a live Eth ETF,‚Äù Seyffart explained.
He added, ‚ÄúThat said, if we‚Äôre correct and we see these theoretical approvals later this week, it *should* mean that S-1 approvals are a matter of ‚Äòwhen‚Äô not ‚Äòif.'‚Äù
Meanwhile, Ethereum‚Äôs value has surged by over 20% following news that the SEC might approve spot ETH ETFs, despite the market‚Äôs earlier consensus that approval was unlikely.

Trump campaign begins accepting bitcoin, ether and other crypto donations - Blockworks


Former President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs website says that the presidential candidate now supports crypto donations.¬†
According to his campaign website, users can donate fiat or, selecting more options, donate crypto. His campaign supports donations made via Coinbase Wallet and MetaMask, and the donations are made to joint fundraising committees organized by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNCH).
‚ÄúDemonstrating President Trump‚Äôs success as a champion of American freedom and innovation, we proudly offer you a chance to contribute to the campaign with cryptocurrency,‚Äù the site said.

The site shows the logos for bitcoin, Ripple‚Äôs XRP, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Solaba, SHIB and Cardano.¬†
Trump promised to allow crypto donations in a speech made earlier this month, which highlighted crypto as a political issue in this year‚Äôs presidential race.¬†
‚ÄúThis addition to President Trump‚Äôs already groundbreaking digital fundraising operation marks the first time a major party Presidential nominee has embraced cryptocurrency for donations,‚Äù a statement about the move said.
It added that Trump plans to ‚Äúbuild a crypto army‚Äù ahead of the Nov. 5 election by allowing supporters to donate crypto.

The former president is not the only candidate in this presidential race to offer people the chance to donate their crypto. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.‚Äôs campaign announced that it would accept bitcoin last May.¬†
But the opportunity for politicians to collect donations in more than just cash can be traced back to 2016, when Senator Rand Paul sought bitcoin donations during that year‚Äôs presidential election.¬†
Presidential candidates Andrew Yang and Eric Salwell also accepted crypto donations back in 2020.

Farcaster Raises $150M Series A from Paradigm | Bankless


Farcaster, the leading decentralized social network, has raised $150 million in a Series A round led by Paradigm, with participation from a16z crypto, USV, Variant, and more.What's the scoop?The latest funding round values Farcaster at $1 billion and comes as the network has facilitated 350K paid signups and an exponential increase in activity since going permissionless in October 2023.¬†While the Farcaster team still has most of its funds from its May 2022 seed fundraise, the new windfall will allow them to further hone in on growing daily active users and adding new in-protocol primitives like channels and direct messaging."We‚Äôre doubling down on Farcaster to grow it to an internet-scale protocol,‚Äù Dan Romero, Farcaster cofounder, said on the news. ‚ÄúThis funding will support our work for many years to come."Bankless take:Farcaster is king of the hill in the crypto social scene right now, so this new raise positions the team well to extend their dominance that much further. The protocol already has a significant swath of developers building atop it, so more money for building new dev-friendly features will undoubtedly lead to new waves of apps and users.Zooming out, this Series A is a big bet on the continued success of Farcaster, and if the protocol does in fact keep gaining traction from here, its rise will signal a shift toward more user-centric and decentralized internet experiences, challenging the status quo of traditional social networks.¬†

ETH NFTs in the Banana Zone | Bankless


Last month, Real Vision cofounder and CEO Raoul Pal said crypto seemed to be on the verge of the banana zone, where majors and altcoins rally hard as new all-time highs (ATHs) are reached.¬†That prospect of the, ahem, banana zone came further into focus this week as the ETH price surged to +$3,700 on the news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seems prepared to approve its first ETH ETFs.¬†With ETH now within 24% of its previous record of $4,878, and having seen $75B in inflows yesterday on the ETF excitement alone, it‚Äôs no stretch to assume that an official ETF approval in the coming days could rocket ETH through its previous ATH and into price discovery mode.¬†Why? As DCinvestor recently pointed out, a supply-side crisis seems brewing around ETH.¬†Imagine the buy pressure of major Wall Street inflows, which could be considerable, to say the least.Then imagine that pressure against how Ethereum only issues ~2.5k ETH per day currently, and at times that issuance can be entirely offset by fee burns, and how there is a ton of ETH essentially locked away in staking and across various apps and Layer 2s (L2s) right now.¬†via XThese factors create a perfect storm for a dramatic supply shock. As more institutional investors and retail buyers rush to gain exposure to ETH, the limited circulating supply would seemingly struggle to meet this demand. This dynamic could propel ETH into uncharted territory, driving prices far beyond previous ATHs.¬†For those of us that stack ETH, that would be great‚Äîbring on the banana zone squared. But what else should we be looking out for?For his part, the banana king himself, Raoul Pal, thinks the next NFT bull run will rev up once ETH breaches through its previous ATH.via XPersonally, I agree, as we‚Äôve seen this play out before. When ETH rallied hard in 2021, people also rallied hard into things you could do with your ETH, like NFTs.¬†That said, if ETH really does take off in the weeks to come, then it‚Äôs not out of the question for the floor prices of, say, the top ETH NFT collections like CryptoPunks, Bored Apes, Pudgy Penguins, and Miladies to double or beyond by summer‚Äôs end. You would also undoubtedly see a resurgence around NFT apps like NFTfi platforms if that happened.¬†via CoinGeckoOf course, I thought Runes would catalyze the Ordinals ecosystem, and while there are surely still synergies to come here, that catalyzing hasn‚Äôt panned out yet.¬†And to be sure, I do think it‚Äôs always good to anticipate the unexpected. Maybe the arrival of ETH ETFs won‚Äôt be a huge catalyst for the ETH NFT scene. Yet the arrival of Runes and the arrival of ETH ETFs are very different beasts.¬†Runes didn‚Äôt kick off the next leg up in the crypto bull market, but ETH ETFs seem primed to do just that. And the potential ETH supply-side crisis has no analogue with Runes.¬†If the ETH price does rocket to new heights, holders will feel more risk-on, and a non-trivial number of them will bid on NFTs they‚Äôve been eyeing over the past bear market. Plus, NFT projects of all stripes have better UX than they did just a few years ago, so the ecosystem is more fertile now.¬†Another angle to consider is that a new bullish momentum in ETH and ETH NFTs would likely spur a new wave of innovation and experimentation within the NFT space, from crosschain experiences to games and beyond.All in all, then? We may be on the verge of the next transformative period in crypto where NFTs and their use cases surge anew. Stay vigilant, and brace yourself, because things may go bananas soon‚Ä¶

Ethereum's Time | Bankless


Impending Approval? Denial of spot ETH ETFs was certain to occur at the outset of the week, but from the depths of multi-year lows on the ETH/BTC ratio echoed a ‚Äúwe‚Äôre so back‚Äù that has radically shifted the prevailing perception. Why are markets now anticipating approval, and have we already priced in the immediate upside?Bloomberg‚Äôs ETF analysts increased their odds of spot ETH ETF approval threefold to 75% yesterday afternoon after hearing information that the SEC may have reversed its looming decision to deny the applications because crypto has increasingly become an election issue.News that the SEC had asked exchanges SEC to update their 19b-4 filings for spot ETH ETFs on ‚Äúan accelerated basis‚Äù broke shortly after Bloomberg updated its approval odds; this request likely would not have been made if denial was certain.
Despite the increasing pervasiveness of expert-driven negative approval sentiment throughout 2024, the eventual listing of spot ETH ETFs had already guaranteed by the approval of commodity futures-based ETH ETFs as of last October.While these experts had extolled that a lack of meaningful communication between the SEC and proposed issuers was proof of denial, it looks increasingly probable that the same level of communication required to approve spot BTC ETFs was unnecessary to approve spot ETH ETFs. In the final months leading up to spot BTC ETF approval, issuers were consulted by the SEC about proposed creation and redemption processes, the roles of authorized participants, and matters related to custody.
Crucially, the approval of futures-based ETH ETF had occurred after Ethereum‚Äôs transition to Proof-of-Stake, nullifying concerns that staking could result in Ether‚Äôs classification as a digital asset security.With the experts close to confident on approval and Polymarket‚Äôs prediction odds now at 66% ‚Äì the highest level since early January ‚Äì consensus is forming that ETH ETF approval is certain to occur this Thursday, leaving those who had prepared for denial caught offsides by a monstrous pump for Ether!
ETH gained nearly $600 in dollar-denominated terms yesterday, its largest single-day gain in price corresponding to a market capitalization increase nearly the size of Solana's total MC, meanwhile the ETH/BTC ratio rallied 20% on the heightened odds of spot ETF approval and regained key support at 0.05 after plunging to new multi-year lows last week.In just under a day, erratic crypto traders went from heavily underweight Ether to trampling over each other for ETH longs, and although we can now anticipate the approval of spot ETH ETF products with confidence, questions remain over whether it will be a bullish catalyst for markets.BTC price fell by 20% in the twelve days following its spot ETF debut, with hefty redemptions on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) suppressing any net flows that could be generated from alternative products until the end of January; Ethereum faces a similar situation, with over $10B in ETH set to become redeemable upon the conversion of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF.Although regulatory filings have revealed a smattering of BTC ETF holdings among institutions, the majority of shares are held by investment advisors on behalf of their retail clients who can easily access crypto through alternative routes and hedge funds that are unlikely to be assuming directional exposure to BTC price.The arrival of Ethereum's spot ETFs is theoretically bullish, but only if they result in net inflows from buyers who are not hedging against price risks (i.e.; hedge funds).Traditional market participants have demonstrated interest in purchasing Ethereum, attested to by the $100M they have put into ETH futures products, but it's unclear if initial inflows will be powerful enough to counteract Grayscale outflows.

Crypto Exchange Binance Discloses Investment in L2 DEX Protocol Aevo - The Daily Hodl


								The venture capital arm of the world‚Äôs largest¬†crypto exchange by trading volume is announcing a new investment in a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol.
According to a new press release, Binance Labs has¬†invested¬†in a layer-2 (L2) DEX called Aevo, a rebrand of Ribbon Finance.










Aevo bills itself as a high-performance derivatives DEX platform tailored for futures and perpetual contracts trading.
The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol is built on top of the Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 protocol Optimism‚Äôs (OP) OP Stack. It acts as an off-chain order book, with orders settled on-chain on Ethereum. The protocol uses Celestia (TIA) as a high-throughput data availability (DA) layer to increase scalability. The project is also backed by Paradigm, Dragonfly and Coinbase Ventures.
According to the announcement, Aevo plans to use the investment to grow the ecosystem and its community, which already has over 50,000 monthly active users who have done more than $80 billion in derivatives volume.
‚ÄúAs part of the future roadmap, Aevo will launch vault strategies, yield products, and Aevo staking. It will expand its ecosystem of derivative products by allowing builders to deploy their dApps permissionlessly on Aevo L2 to leverage its growing user base and unique features.‚Äù

Venture Capitalist Rips Into Cardano, Questions Network's Decentralization Claims


								Justin Bons, the founder of Cyber Capital, has¬†launched a scathing attack on Cardano, claiming that the Ethereum competitor is ‚Äúcentralized.‚Äù Venture capitalists are convinced that this level of centralization, at the protocol level, is a ‚Äúmajor weakness of the proof-of-chain blockchain.‚Äù
Founder: Cardano Is Centralized
According to Bons‚Äô assessment, there is a problem with Cardano‚Äôs ‚Äúgenesis keys.‚Äù Technically, these keys are a multi-signature system that grants control over core protocol rules. 
In a post on X, the VC argued that these keys confer ‚Äúexcessive power‚Äù to Input Output Global (IOG), the company developing the smart contract platform.

The Genesis keys were introduced during the third phase of Cardano‚Äôs development: Shelley. The problem is that these ‚Äúkeys were not a temporary measure but released as part of the network‚Äôs design.‚Äù As earlier designed, the IOG didn‚Äôt have the absolute power of the genesis keys. 
However, the Cardano Foundation‚Äôs decision to delegate its control to the developer meant that IOG was now in control.
Cardano price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: ADAUSDT on Binance, TradingView
The alleged centralization, Bons claim, is that IOG ‚Äúcontrols five out of the seven genesis keys.‚Äù With this, the developer can unilaterally alter the protocol without community consensus. This level of control, the founder adds, ‚Äúgoes against Cardano‚Äôs claims that the platform is one of the highly decentralized, even better than Ethereum.‚Äù
That IOG has this power, Bons continued, means ‚Äúthey can exploit these keys and even disrupt the network.‚Äù For instance, the developer can stop the blockchain from processing blocks or modify how ADA is distributed to validators.¬†
The Venture Capital founder claims that the centralization of Genesis keys can¬†be seen in the deliberately slow development approach. Unlike competitors like Solana, Cardano is still being refined, with IOG planning to enhance efficiency once Voltaire goes live.
Cardano roadmap | Source: Cardano
Will Voltaire Increase Decentralization Levels?
By design, public blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin, for example, are decentralized. Though the level of decentralization varies as they evolve, validators are guaranteed not to censor transactions or reverse some, even in extreme disruptive hacks. 
The censorship resistance feature gives these ledgers an edge over centralized options, explaining the rapidly increasing adoption across the board.

How IOG and the Cardano community will resolve this remains to be seen. In the next development phase, Voltaire, the network will introduce on-chain governance. With this, the use of Genesis keys will be a thing of the past.

Bits + Bips: Is US Politics Driving the ETH ETF Approval? - Unchained


                                Why ETH spot ETFs are now more likely‚Äîand the reversal may have come from the Biden administration. Will this lead to ETH reaching all-time highs, sway US elections, or spark a new wave of crypto spot ETFs?

RFK Jr. Says He Bought GameStop to ‚ÄòPunish Predator Short Selling to the Moon‚Äô - Decrypt

As crypto policy increasingly divides political parties, U.S. Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.‚Äîbetter known as RFK‚Äîis now touting his love for meme stocks.In a Wednesday Twitter post, the independent candidate said that he had bought $24,000 in GameStop stock as a way to ‚Äúpunish predatory short selling.‚Äù¬†GameStop (NYSE:GME) is a video game retailer which first made headlines in 2021 when amateur traders started buying its stock and pumping its price. It made a comeback last week after the trader that started the 2021 buying frenzy, known as Roaring Kitty, posted online for the first time in nearly three years.¬†‚ÄúWe need a free and fair market,‚Äù RFK tweeted. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs punish predatory short-selling to the moon. By the way, I ride with you and I‚Äôm not leaving.‚ÄùHe added: ‚ÄúMy administration will support the Ape retail rebellion and enact aggressive Wall Street reforms.‚ÄùRFK was referring to the Wall Street firms that had initially shorted GameStop stock, betting that its price would go down. The 2021 trading frenzy aimed to stymie this strategy, and promote investing among ordinary citizens.¬†Roaring Kitty‚Äîreal name Keith Gill‚Äîurged people to invest. The craze eventually led to Wall Street chaos due to shares suddenly going up in value.¬†Despite this, it has since been revealed that major Wall Street firms such as BlackRock and Vanguard held GameStop shares and may have raked in billions of dollars as a result.¬†Such investments are now known as meme stocks‚Äîshares of companies made popular on Internet forums. Meme stocks later led to a surge in popularity in cryptocurrencies known as meme coins.Both meme coins and stocks shot up in value last week following Roaring Kitty‚Äôs return, with some investors making huge gains.¬†Crypto has becoming an increasingly pivotal issue in politics, with Trump stepping up his courtship of cryptocurrency holders and U.S. President Joe Biden finding himself at odds with some in his own party over federal regulation of the space.RFK is not a newcomer to the space, and aligned himself with the digital asset industry in the past. He previously said he wants the U.S. dollar and Treasury Bills to be backed by Bitcoin, and vowed to put the U.S. budget on the blockchain if elected.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

                        Former U.S. Treasury official Graham Steele is receiving backlash after he took to X Monday morning to scrutinize support for the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) ahead of its likely vote on Wednesday.Steele‚Äôs X post came in response to a social media petition created by Digital Innovation For America (DIFA) supporting the bill, claiming that ‚Äúthe best way to fight Big Tech is with Blockchain technology.‚ÄùX Users React After Graham Steele Shares Stance On DIFA FIT21 Petition
Calling the written request ‚Äúpretty sneaky,‚Äù Steele noted that the highly-anticipated crypto bill does not include a prohibition on ‚ÄúBig Tech.‚Äù‚ÄúThis petition about the FIT 21 Act uses progressive framing, claiming that the bill fights against ‚Äú‚ÄòBig Tech,‚Äô‚Äù Steele said. ‚ÄúFIT 21 actually creates a light-touch regulatory framework for crypto, largely outside securities laws.‚ÄúConsisting of organizations such as Amazon, Apple, and Meta, some members of the crypto community feel that standard ‚ÄúBig Tech‚Äù companies‚Äô top-down structure may at times stand in stark contrast to blockchain‚Äôs traditionally decentralized nature, seemingly prompting social media backlash to Steele‚Äôs take on DIFA‚Äôs petition.‚ÄúPoor take,‚Äù one X user replied. ‚ÄúEducate yourself about the tech and what is happening here.‚Äù‚ÄúI would argue this is fighting back against big tech,‚Äù another alleged. ‚ÄúBlockchain networks are better for consumers than corporate networks.‚Äù‚ÄúYou are making this a partisan issue and alienating millions of young, enthusiastic voters who want freedom to innovate,‚Äù a third claimed. ‚ÄúDecentralized crypto threatens ‚ÄòBig Tech‚Äô ‚Äì they are fighting against it! We hoped you would be different.‚ÄùMartin Gruenberg‚Äôs Replacement And A House Vote On FIT21
Steele‚Äôs post came amid a turbulent 24 hours for the FDIC, with Chair Gruenberg announcing he would resign from his position in light of sexual harassment, discrimination, and general misconduct concerns.In a statement on Monday, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sam Michael claimed Biden would announce Gruenberg‚Äôs replacement ‚Äúsoon,‚Äù with recent reports suggesting that Steele may make the cut to take over the position.The federal corporation has previously warned about the potential risks associated with crypto-assets pertaining to banking organizations.Meanwhile, the House is gearing up for a full floor vote on FIT21, which is scheduled for Wednesday.Backed by several key industry leaders in the crypto space, a successful vote on the bill could prove critical in establishing a robust regulatory framework with increased freedom for digital asset operators across the United States.

Donald Trump now accepts Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and other cryptos for his election campaign

Photo: Michael M. Santiago (Reuters)The presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, announced late Tuesday afternoon that he would accept donations in Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, Solana, and other cryptocurrencies. With this move, he has become the first major party candidate to embrace digital currencies. Earlier this month, the former president declared himself as the candidate for cryptocurrency at a Mar-a-Lago gala, propelling crypto into the 2024 campaign.Why Bitcoin and Ether are skyrocketingCryptocurrency donations will be accepted through the Coinbase Commerce product. ‚ÄúMAGA [Make America Great Again] supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th,‚Äù per the statement.Trump‚Äôs recent stance on cryptocurrency is viewed as an attack on Democrats, who have historically been unsupportive of cryptocurrency. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in particular, campaigned against cryptocurrency. However, this year, even some Democrats are pro-cryptocurrency, distancing themselves from Warren‚Äôs stance.Crypto has emerged as a political topic¬†in this election year, with presidential candidate Trump making several pro-crypto¬†statements during his campaigns. However, he has not yet declared how he plans to support cryptocurrency and blockchain growth through policies. His position on cryptocurrency represents a significant U-turn. A few years ago, he denounced Bitcoin as ‚Äúa scam against the U.S. dollar‚Äù and said the central bank digital currencies are ‚Äúvery dangerous.‚Äù In the past years, he said that crypto is ‚Äúa disaster waiting to happen‚Äù and that he is ‚Äúnot a fan of it.‚Äù But now he says he is ‚Äúgood‚Äù with it.

Microsoft Recall Is Spyware And an Obvious Target, Say Security Experts - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsWhen Microsoft announced its new Recall feature during its annual developer conference on Monday, the news made waves beyond the AI industry. Cybersecurity and privacy experts also took notice‚Äîand they were concerned.During the presentation, Microsoft said new Copilot-enabled computers will remember and later be able to find anything displayed on screen‚Äîincluding emails, websites, and applications‚Äîthrough AI-indexed snapshots stored on-device. Reaction to the announcement was mixed, prompting some security experts to call the feature spyware and a natural target for cybercriminals.‚ÄúThis is the company that wants to record literally everything you ever do on your computer,‚Äù Geometric Intelligence founder and CEO Gary Marcus wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt think Microsoft Recall, local or no, will be one of the biggest cyber targets in history, you aren‚Äôt paying attention.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad Microsoft is out here helping me recall why I don‚Äôt use Windows if I can help it, and when I do, I disable every ‚Äòsmart‚Äô feature they add,‚Äù writer at Linus Tech Tips Emily Young wrote.‚ÄúBack in my day, we called this spyware,‚Äù Software Engineer and crypto researcher and critic Molly White wrote.With Recall, verything that appears on screen is captured‚Äîincluding passwords, if the app or form doesn't automatically obscure it.Although a simple premise, the implementation of Recall requires a lot of care, cybersecurity expert Katelyn Bowden told Decrypt.‚ÄúRecall appears to function like existing search engines, with an expanded scope of what it records,‚Äù Bowden said, noting that Recall only functions on PCs with specific hardware configurations. ‚ÄúYou already have a browser history and file contents index on your PC, and this is functionally no different. And unlike many of those files, Microsoft says Recall data is encrypted.‚ÄúIf Microsoft were to start off-loading processing of the training set, or collecting data for use in recommendation engines or off-machine models, user privacy could be compromised,‚Äù she noted.Bowden is a member of the hacker collective known as the Cult of the Dead Cow¬†and also serves as the chief marketing officer at the open-source privacy-focused Veilid Project. She said more transparency around how AI tools are used is essential.‚ÄúI always feel more comfortable when companies who develop AI products are transparent about what datasets were used to train the software,‚Äù Bowden said. ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äôs lack of transparency surrounding that concerns me. If people don‚Äôt know what data was used to train the model, they shouldn‚Äôt submit to it.‚ÄùWith OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft pushing hard to bring generative AI products to market, several projects and groups are also offering decentralized and open-source alternatives, including Venice AI, FLock, PolkaBot AI, and the Superintelligence Alliance.Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote earlier today that open-source AI is the best way to avoid a future where ‚Äúmost human thought becomes read and mediated by a few central servers controlled by a few people.‚Äù‚ÄúPeople should assume that everything they write to OpenAI is going to them and that they have it forever,‚Äù Venice AI founder and CEO Erik Voorhees previously told Decrypt. ‚ÄúThe only way to resolve that is by using a service where the information does not go to a central repository at all in the first place.‚ÄùEdited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Dogecoin Forms Bullish Triangle Pattern, Analyst Reveals The Next Target | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin is currently seeing reasonable upside following the Bitcoin recovery above $71,000. This has sent the whole crypto market into a state of euphoria, and the DOGE price has crossed the $0.16 resistance while at it. This bullish trend is expected to continue, as one analyst points out that Dogecoin has formed a bullish triangle pattern.
Dogecoin Triangle Pattern Points To More Upside
In a TradingView post, crypto analyst Lingrid pointed out an interesting formation on the Dogecoin chart. According to the analyst, the meme coin has successfully formed a triangle pattern, which has been historically bullish for the price.

Explaining how this came to be, the crypto analyst explained that the market has been consolidating below the upper border of the triangle. Now, this triangle pattern often leads to a price squeeze, which is very bullish for its price.
Lingrid identified a range zone for Dogecoin just above $0.15, which was important to the formation of the triangle. This is because the appearance of a range zone suggests that accumulation is going on and it is time for the price to begin to move. Sometimes, this can be either bearish or bullish, but as the crypto analyst points out, with the ‚Äúconsolidating just below the upper border of the triangle,‚Äù this time around, it is bullish for the price.

Additionally, the meme coin has been creating higher lows, suggesting that this is a sustained bullish trend. ‚ÄúIf the price breaks through the downward trendline, we can expect a bullish rally to follow. Furthermore, if the price breaks through the range zone and closes above it, it‚Äôs likely that the market will move higher. My target is resistance at 0.17500,‚Äù Lingrid states.
DOGE Remains Bullish
This week, the Dogecoin price has turned rather bullish as investor interest has turned toward the meme coin. One way that this is shining through is the trading volume of the digital asset which has jumped more than 130% in the last week. Currently, Coinmarketcap data shows a more than 132% increase in trading volume which has sent it to almost $2 billion at the time of writing.

At the same time, there has been a significant increase in the Dogecoin open interest, suggesting that traders are now betting big on the DOGE price. Coinglass data shows that in the last 24 hours, there is an 18% increase to reach $921.4 million. This is the highest that the open interest has been in the past month and shows a turn in the tide from the bearish trend. Historically, an increase in open interest has usually correlated with an increase in price. So, in this case, it is expected that the price rally will continue.
For now, DOGE bulls continue to dominate the market, pushing it over 8% in the last day. It is currently trading at $0.164, which is a 122% increase in the last year.

Gala Games Recovers $23M Stolen By Hacker, Plans Token Buyback Program


																In a recent security incident, Gala Games, a Web3 gaming company, fell victim to an exploit that led to the unauthorized minting of 5 billion tokens, equivalent to approximately $214 million.¬†
The hacker behind the breach subsequently sold 592 million GALA tokens, amounting to $21.8 million in value, as blockchain analysis firm Lookonchain confirmed.
CEO Of Gala Games Takes Responsibility For Breach
Gala Games responded to the breach, assuring the community via social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the security incident involving the GALA token had been contained and that the affected wallet had been frozen.¬†
The company acknowledged the isolated nature of the incident and stated that it had addressed the cause while collaborating closely with law enforcement agencies to investigate the individuals responsible for the breach.

	Related Reading



Eric Schiermeyer, CEO of Gala Games, expressed his regret over the incident, referencing his previous stance on projects experiencing hacks.¬†
Schiermeyer disclosed that the breach led to the unauthorized sale of 600 million GALA tokens, equivalent to $21 million, and the subsequent burning of 4.4 billion tokens. Within 45 minutes, Gala Games identified the compromise and effectively secured and removed unauthorized access to the GALA contract.
Reassuring stakeholders, Schiermeyer emphasized that the Ethereum (ETH) contract for GALA remained secure and protected by a multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet, with no compromise detected.¬†
Acknowledging internal control shortcomings, Schiermeyer also admitted responsibility for the incident and outlined the steps being taken to prevent its recurrence.
Gala Games expressed confidence in identifying the culprit behind the breach. They confirmed active collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and a network of international authorities to ensure appropriate legal actions are pursued.
The incident raised concerns regarding the project‚Äôs daily distribution, prompting Gala Games to propose a node vote to address the issue. As per their community-driven approach, the decision on how to proceed will be determined by the community itself.
DFW Labs Support
In response to the incident, DFW Labs, a Web3 investor and market maker, took action to alleviate selling pressure in the market. They purchased 28 million GALA tokens from the open market to stabilize the value of the token, which had fallen to $0.037 on Monday following the exploit.¬†
However, with the investment from DFW Labs, the token rebounded to its current trading price of $0.0431, representing a loss of 7.8% in the last 24 hours.¬†

                        As the Fantom (FTM) price climbs to new monthly highs, investors are asking whether it might be too late to buy Fantom.Last at $0.8744, FTM is up 35% in the past seven days according to CoinMarketCap.A seemingly sudden shift in the SEC‚Äôs position on Ethereum ETFs has injected positive momentum into market this week.Fidelity, Vaneck, Invesco, Ark 21Shares and Franklin all filed amended 19B-4 applications on Tuesday.That comes one day after rumors emerged that the SEC might approve spot Ethereum ETFs as soon as this week.That helped launch FTM nearly as high as $1.0 on Monday, with the price having since dropped around 5%.While not in as much focus this week, macro is also more of a tailwind these days.US jobs and CPI inflation data this month helped bolster bets for Fed rate cuts this year. Tomorrow‚Äôs Fed minutes release shouldn‚Äôt threaten that narrative too much.When financial markets move to price in easier financial conditions, this tends to bolster crypto.And high-beta altcoins like Fantom are especially sensitive to changes in financial conditions.Fantom also recently kickstarted an exciting upgrade to integrate its innovative Sonic technology.The outlook in crypto markets seems tilted towards more near-term upside.So is it too late to buy Fantom?Is It Too Late to Buy Fantom?
Well, investors jumping in now will have missed the bottom of the recent price dip by a large margin.But that doesn‚Äôt mean its too late to buy Fantom.FTM remains nearly 30% below its 2024 highs. So investors can, at the very least, rest assured that they aren‚Äôt buying the market right at its recent peak.Nor is the Fantom price anywhere near its long-term peak.FTM briefly surpassed $3.70 in 2021, so it is still trading at a 75% discount versus its record highs.If FTM can break to the north of its 2021 highs this cycle, investors could still bag 5x gains.In that sense, it definitely isn‚Äôt too late to buy Fantom.If Fantom (FTM) can hit new record highs this cycle, then that means it definitely isnt too late to buy Fantom.

The outlook for Fantom is strong this bull market. The Fantom Foundation is pushing to kickstart a meme season on the blockchain.If successful, this could accelerate FTM‚Äôs appreciation, as seen with Solana.But, as noted, FTM‚Äôs gains this bull market might be limited to as much as 5x.Those gains are to be sniffed at. But some crypto traders will be targeting much greater upside.Such traders often flock to the meme coin market hunting for gems.One potential meme coin gem that analysts at Cryptonews like a lot is Wiener AI (WAI).The sausage dog-themed coin offers useful AI-powered trading tools¬†and has already raised over $2.5 million in its presale.WAI is not only a meme coin with AI capabilities but also a potential¬†passive income gem.20% of the supply has been allocated to staking rewards, and investors are currently earning a massive 396% APY, as per the project‚Äôs¬†official website.At this rate, investors can double their initial presale investment in just a few months.Crypto experts have been lining up to join the Sausage army. Here‚Äôs why widely followed crypto analyst Michael Wrubel, who boasts over 312,000 YouTube subscribers, ranks WAI as a top crypto for 2024.VIDEOInterested investors need to move quickly, as the WAI price will rise when the presale hits $2.7 million.At the current price of $0.000709, WAI‚Äôs market cap is under $50 million.If it achieves market leadership, early investors stand to benefit greatly, with a potential for 100x gains or more.Buy Wiener AI Here

                        Tuesday, May 21, 2024- As Sealana‚Äôs (SEAL) presale passes the $2 million mark, the Solana-based meme coin is poised to become the next crypto to explode in value. Sealana is a playful and culturally resonant meme coin inspired by a patriotic, obese American redneck seal reminiscent of the South Park World of Warcraft character.The Sealana presale operates on a fixed price model, selling tokens at $0.022 each. Investors can purchase $SEAL using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, or with fiat currency using a bank card.Sealana‚Äôs quirky concept and its play on American culture has struck a chord with the crypto community, visibly driving interest and investment. The concept is simple yet engaging: feed Sealana SOL (Solana‚Äôs native token), fatten him up, and watch as he repays you with SEAL straight into your wallet.After achieving the $2 million-mark milestone, the FOMO for Sealana‚Äôs market debut continues to build. The latest Solana meme coin is well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum.The success of previous Solana meme coins like Slothana (SLOTH), which, like Sealana, raised $15 million in its send-to-wallet presale in just over four weeks, sets a promising precedent for Sealana.Solana has emerged as a robust platform for meme coins, thanks to its stability, efficiency and low transaction costs.Solana Network Remains Resilient, Sealana Continues the Momentum Solana is up 25.36% over the past week and the viral meme coins on its network have remained resilient. Notable examples include DogWifHat, which is up 28.12% and POPCAT, which increased 9.26% in the last 24 hours.Betting on Solana-based meme coins right now could prove beneficial. SLOTH, which is down by 19% over last week, after launching on the top 10 HTX exchange, could be worth a look too.The cryptocurrency market is expected to experience a summer meme coin frenzy, driven by bullish sentiment following April‚Äôs Bitcoin halving.Historically Bitcoin halvings have led to increased interest in the broader crypto market, including meme coins. This anticipated market shift could further boost Sealana‚Äôs prospects.Meanwhile, the market is abuzz with speculation that the team behind Sealana may have also been involved with SLERF ‚Äì another meme coin that recorded an all-time high price of $1.30 in March 2024, but is currently trading at $0.3117. Traders in the SLERF market might now be looking for the next strong Solana meme coin, like Sealana.VIDEOSealana Presale: A Safe Bet For Q2 2024? Since March 12, Solana has consistently outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum, making it an attractive option for meme coin projects. The growth is supported by technological advancements such as token extensions, which enhance the functionality and utility of SPL tokens.The broader Solana system continues to experience rapid growth, with significant increases in DEX trading volumes and project funding.Sealana represents the next wave of Solana-based meme coins, blending cultural resonance with innovative blockchain technology.Investors looking for the next big thing in crypto should keep a close eye on Sealana.Follow the latest developments on Sealana‚Äôs X account and Telegram channel.Don‚Äôt miss your chance to purchase Sealana at what could be its lowest price ever.

√¢¬Ä¬úIt√¢¬Ä¬ôs happening√¢¬Ä¬ù: Ethereum ETF approval is imminent as issuers amend 19b-4 filings - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart shared on X that the movement to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US ‚Äúis happening.‚Äù According to Seyffart, at least five of the potential Ethereum ETF issuers have submitted their Amended 19b-4s in a 25-minute timespan.‚ÄúFidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares, & Franklin all submitted via CBOE,‚Äù he added. The 19b-4 Form is one of the mandatory documents that need to be filed before the SEC can approve an ETF.However, even with the spot Ethereum ETFs approved in the US, Seyffart highlights that this doesn‚Äôt mean an immediate launch. Notably, it can take up to months after the approval of Ethereum ETFs before they can be officially traded.‚ÄúBut these filings prove that all of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate. Need to actually see SEC approval orders on all the 19b-4s AND THEN we need to see S-1 approvals. Could be weeks or more before ETFs launch,‚Äù added the Bloomberg analyst in another post.¬†Most likely a political decisionCommenting on a The Block article about the motivations behind the sudden pivot to a spot Ethereum ETF approval, Seyffart agreed with undisclosed sources that stated this is ‚Äúa completely unprecedented situation, which means it‚Äôs entirely political,‚Äù and that ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not even internally coordinated yet, which is why this is most likely a political decision.‚ÄùJames‚Äô fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas already suggested this in a Monday X post, saying that rumors around the SEC shift in stance pointed to ‚Äúpolitical issues.‚ÄùSeyffart concludes his series of posts on X by admitting that he was wrong about a spot Ethereum ETF approval not happening this week, but so was the entire market.¬†Notably, as reported by Crypto Briefing, not even notorious fund managers were expecting a spot Ethereum ETF approval in the US this week. Katherine Dowling, general counsel for ETF applicant Bitwise, said that ‚Äúmost people are universally expecting a disapproval order.‚Äù VanEck CEO Jan van Eck also predicted a likely denial during a CNBC interview.

Standard Chartered Maintains $8,000 ETH Price Target as it Expects Green Light for Ether ETFs This Week | Cryptoglobe


                                
Standard Chartered, a British multinational banking and financial services company, has revealed it expects the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve the listing of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the country this week, and maintained its $8,000 price target for ETH.



The bank‚Äôs Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research reportedly told The Block that with key deadlines for spot Ether ETF applications looming ‚Äì May 23 for VanEck and May 24 for Ark 21 Shares ‚Äì the bank is ‚Äú80% to 90%‚Äù sure that these funds will be approved.



The potential impact is significant. Standard Chartered estimates that these spot Ether ETFs could attract significant investment, bringing in 2.39 to 9.15 million ETH within the first year, translating to roughly $15 billion to $45 billion in U.S. dollars in a figure that it sees as ‚Äúproving accurate‚Äù according to estimates for inflows for the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs.



Looking beyond approval, the bank‚Äôs analysis suggests Ether‚Äôs price could keep on climbing rapidly this year and maintain a 5.4% price ratio with the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which would suggest an $8,000 price target by the end of the year if BTC maanges to hit $150,000 as it predicts.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Earlier this year the bank revealed it was expecting spot Ether ETF applications to be approved by May 23 , but given the market‚Äôs expectations of a rejection earlier this month the bank had said that delays in the approval were already ‚Äúpriced in.‚Äù



Standard Chartered‚Äôs prediction comes after a dramatic rise in cryptocurrency prices related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds¬†update key filings¬†related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.



¬†Before any trading can begin, issuers of spot Ether ETFs must receive the go-ahead on their S-1 registration statements, with the SEC having no set deadline to review these filings.

Trump campaign leans in on crypto with new donation page amid shifting political landscape

Former President Donald Trump has begun accepting crypto donations for his re-election campaign, making him the first US Presidential candidate to adopt digital assets for funding.According to a May 21 statement:‚ÄúThis addition to President Trump‚Äôs already groundbreaking digital fundraising operation marks the first time a major party Presidential nominee has embraced cryptocurrency for donations.‚ÄùThe website‚Äôs available information showed that crypto users could donate in different digital assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and others.Crypto has become a pivotal topic in the lead-up to the November elections, with former President Trump and President Joe Biden expected to be the primary candidates for their respective parties.The candidates have taken a diverging stance toward the emerging industry, with Trump openly supporting crypto and promising to foster its growth through proper regulation. Trump stated:‚ÄúDemocrats, like Biden and his official surrogate Elizabeth Warren, continue to believe only government has the answers to how our nation leads the world.‚ÄùHowever, recent events suggest that the Biden administration may shift its long-standing hardline stance against the space.Ethereum ETFOn May 20, reports surfaced that the US SEC might approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) ‚Äî a stark pivot from earlier expectations.Bloomberg Intelligence Analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the SEC‚Äôs turnaround might have political motivations, a view shared by many in the crypto community.Variant Fund chief legal officer Jake Chervinsky said:‚ÄúIf the spot ETH ETF is approved, it will be a true shock to everyone I know in DC who‚Äôs close to this process. That doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt happen. It means approval could signal a major shift in US crypto policy.‚ÄùCongressional developmentLast week, US lawmakers from both parties united to overturn the SEC‚Äôs Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) resolution despite President Biden‚Äôs stated intent to veto the bill.Several crypto stakeholders have argued that the bulletin was controversial, as SAB 121 required financial institutions to safeguard customer assets and keep them¬†on their balance sheets. Notably, the American Bankers Association (ABA) pointed out that the regulation made it difficult for banks to act as spot Bitcoin ETF custodians.This rare bipartisan event precedes the upcoming Senate vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), widely considered the most significant piece of crypto-specific legislation likely to become law.The FIT21 bill will establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for the digital assets industry in the US. The bill has widespread industry support from key players, including¬†Coinbase, Kraken, and Andreessen Horowitz.Moreover, the bill will establish a baseline for classifying digital assets as securities or commodities. It expands the CFTC‚Äôs authority to register and regulate digital commodities and requires the FTC and SEC to jointly issue rules for assets not otherwise classified.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

VanEck's Ethereum spot ETF listed on DTCC under ticker $ETHV - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            VanEck‚Äôs proposed spot Ethereum ETF¬†has appeared¬†on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation‚Äôs (DTCC) new securities list with the ticker $ETHV. This development comes shortly after Cboe released amended 19b-4 forms.
ETHV: VanEck‚Äôs Ethereum ETF Awaits SEC Approval, Listed on DTCCWhile the DTCC listing is a crucial step for the ETF, it does not guarantee the US Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) approval, which is still pending.VanEck‚Äôs spot Ethereum ETF application will likely be the first to get a decision from the SEC. The SEC will decide whether to deny or approve the product.Van Eck filed for a spot Ethereum ETF in September 2023. Many other industry giants like BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Fidelity also followed suit.The outlook for Ethereum-based funds was previously not promising as people involved in conversations with the SEC stated that there was an ongoing lack of engagement.However, things started to take a turn just a few days before the May 23 verdict. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart estimate there is now a 75% chance of SEC approval for a spot Ethereum ETF. They cite staking removal and political issues as the key drivers.Standard Chartered is also confident in the regulatory approval potential of the spot Ethereum ETF. Additionally, the bank is bullish on Ethereum‚Äôs price, projecting that it is on track to hit $8,000 by year-end.Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has shown impressive performance following positive developments in the Ethereum ETF. Ethereum surged 8% after Bloomberg analysts raised the odds and extended its rally, breaking through its $3,500 key level. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at around $3,700, up 31% in the last 7 days.

Dogecoin Bulls On The Rise: Analyst Highlight Path To $0.2


																Dogecoin (DOGE), the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency, is currently demonstrating signals that suggest it might be on the cusp of a significant bullish breakout.
According to a recent analysis from prominent crypto analyst Ali, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency appears to be approaching a crucial resistance level, with market behaviors hinting at potential upward movement.

Eyes Set On Breaking The $0.2 Resistance Level
Ali, a well-known market analyst, pointed out that Dogecoin is testing the possibility of reaching its highest price level in over a month at $0.2. His analysis is based on DOGE‚Äôs recent escape from a descending triangle pattern, which typically suggests a shift in market dynamics favoring buyers.
Following a pattern similar to the previous cycle, where DOGE experienced a retracement after breaking out from a descending pattern before rallying, the asset has recently completed a significant 47% retracement.
This movement has led Ali to highlight the market‚Äôs tendency to echo past patterns, though not perfectly. With the breakout from the descending pattern and subsequent retracement now complete, DOGE is positioning itself for another push toward the $0.2 resistance level.

This level has proven challenging, with selling pressure frequently intensifying around this range. However, the broader market sentiment remains bullish, which could support Dogecoin‚Äôs push toward this key price point.
Notably, to reach $0.2, DOGE would need to increase further by nearly 20% from its current position. Currently, the memecoin is trading at $0.168, reflecting a 10% increase over the past 24 hours and continuing a week-long uptrend that has seen nearly a 15% increase.

Surging Interest In Dogecoin And Strong Upside Signal
The positive movement in DOGE‚Äôs price performance is further underscored by a surge in DOGE‚Äôs open interest, which has risen by 23% in the past day to reach $1 billion, according to data from Coinglass.

Additionally, the open interest volume has soared by 200%, now at nearly $4 billion. An increase in open interest indicates that new market participants are entering or existing positions are being expanded. This can be a sign of strengthening market activity and a supportive factor for the ongoing price increase.
Echoing Ali‚Äôs sentiment, another analyst from Crypto Daily Trade Signals identified a symmetrical triangle pattern in DOGE‚Äôs price movements, reinforcing the potential for continued upward momentum.

According to this analysis, Dogecoin is showing signs of bullish behavior, with immediate resistance near $0.15950. However, since DOGE already surpassed that, the analyst noted other resistance levels at $0.16980 and $0.18440.

‚ÄòAll Bets Are Off‚Äô - Top Analyst Unveils Crypto Market Forecast Amid Increased Odds of Ethereum ETF Approval - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist says that a certain altcoin group will massively benefit from the approval of a spot market Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 554,400 followers on the social media platform X that while an Ethereum ETF might be a bit bearish for Bitcoin (BTC) inflows, it will be bullish for Ethereum and an altcoin cohort that has yet to see big rallies.










‚ÄúThink ETH ETF would take quite a bit of bid away from BTC. Think ETH ETF would lead to ETH going up which would lead to more stupidity in the market. Think it‚Äôs good news ETH alts only basically, but that‚Äôs worth a lot given they‚Äôve been depressed for so long they‚Äôre dirt cheap.‚Äù
Yesterday, the crypto market took off amid reports that an Ethereum ETF now has a 75% chance of getting the green light from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
According to DonAlt, an Ethereum ETF will give the crypto markets a massive shot in the arm.
‚ÄúAnyway if we get an ETH ETF all bets are off. Retardation can go to new ATH (all-time high) levels and we‚Äôll all be friends again. Shit would be wild in my opinion and would change my mind on a lot of things short term.‚Äù¬†
The analyst names one altcoin that will likely witness a breakout rally if an Ethereum ETF gets approved.
‚Äú[Pepe is] the main ETH memecoin. I‚Äôd rather not fade it if we truly get an ETH ETF. Still technically below resistance but I don‚Äôt like the chances that holds.‚Äù¬†
Source: DonAlt/X
At time of writing, Pepe (PEPE) is trading at $0.0000111, well above DonAlt‚Äôs resistance level.

US DOJ Seizes $100M In Crypto From Major Dark Web Drug Trafficking Operation | Bitcoinist.com


								In a recent crackdown on illicit transactions involving crypto assets, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) arrested Rui-Siang Lin, a 23-year-old individual from Taiwan. Lin, who also goes by the names Pharoah and Faro, is accused of owning and operating a dark web drug marketplace known as the ‚ÄúIncognito Market.‚Äù¬†
The platform allegedly facilitated anonymous crypto-based transactions of illegal narcotics with a total value of more than $100 million worldwide.
$100 Million Crypto Operation Exposed
According to the complaint and indictment, Incognito Market emerged in October 2020 as an online narcotics bazaar operating on the dark web. Until its closure in March, the marketplace facilitated the sale of over $100 million worth of crypto in narcotics, including substantial quantities of cocaine and methamphetamines.¬†

Accessible to global users with internet connectivity, Incognito Market could be reached via the Tor web browser on the darknet. Lin, operating under the online pseudonyms ‚ÄúPharoah‚Äù or ‚ÄúFaro,‚Äù acted as the market leader¬†and oversaw all its operations, including employees, vendors, and customers.¬†
US Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York highlighted that Lin‚Äôs alleged operation exploited the community for personal profit, emphasizing that criminal actors would be pursued regardless of whether they operated on street corners or the ‚Äúdark corners of the internet.‚Äù¬†
Dark Web Drug Lord Arrested
According to the DOJ, Incognito Market was designed to facilitate seamless narcotics transactions worldwide by incorporating features commonly seen on legitimate e-commerce sites, such as branding, advertising, and customer service.¬†
Users reportedly gained access to the marketplace by logging in with unique usernames and passwords, allowing them to search thousands of listings for the drugs of their choice.¬†
It is further alleged that the platform sold illegal narcotics and misbranded prescription drugs, including heroin, cocaine, LSD, MDMA, oxycodone, methamphetamines, ketamine, and alprazolam.¬†
To become a vendor on Incognito Market, individuals had to register with the site and pay an admission fee. In exchange for listing and selling narcotics, vendors paid 5% of the purchase price to Incognito Market. Lin accumulated millions of dollars in profits from the operation.¬†
Interestingly, the marketplace had a ‚Äúbank‚Äù that allowed users to deposit crypto assets into their ‚Äúdigital bank accounts.‚Äù After a transaction, the cryptocurrency was transferred from the buyer‚Äôs account to the seller‚Äôs account, with Incognito Market taking a 5% fee.¬†

Lin was arrested on May 18 at John F. Kennedy Airport, and he is set to appear before US Magistrate Judge Willis in Manhattan federal court.¬†
If found guilty, Lin faces severe penalties, including a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for narcotics conspiracy, a maximum sentence of 20 years for money laundering, and a maximum sentence of 20 years for conspiracy to distribute narcotics.¬†

XRP starts to rise amidst Ethereum ETF hopes: What's next? - AMBCrypto



XRP holders rejoiced as prices advanced toward a key resistance zone.
The on-chain metrics showed accumulation but also warned of potential selling pressure.

Ripple [XRP] saw a moderate price jump on the 20th of May. It gained 6.13% in a 24-hour window and during the same time, Bitcoin [BTC] climbed by 6.9% but saw a minor dip from $71.3k to $70.9.
Despite the gains, XRP continued to trade within a long-term range and faced a strong supply zone at $0.57-$0.585.
The Ethereum [ETH] ETF approval chances were upgraded to 75% from 25% by Eric Balchunas and saw the token‚Äôs prices rocket upward by 20% within a few hours.
The ETF analyst added that it took everyone by surprise.
This could lead to spot ETFs being filed for other cryptos. As one of the largest tokens in the market, XRP could be among the next cryptos that ETF issuers submit applications for.
Yet, the ongoing SEC-XRP case remains a hurdle for issuers.
Crypto markets are jumpy and investors need to watch out
In November 2023, XRP surged to $0.7503 because of fake reports that BlackRock had filed for a spot XRP ETF. A month before this event, false news of a Bitcoin spot ETF approval saw BTC prices surge by 10%.
In both cases, the strong gains were quickly reversed. Therefore, while XRP might see vast price pumps due to such reports or speculation, it will do little to embolden investor confidence.
Hence, AMBCrypto analyzed social and network metrics to understand if the token might see a genuine rally in the coming months.

The daily Weighted Sentiment has been positive for a good chunk of the past month. During this time, XRP made higher lows, but still struggled to form a long-term uptrend.
The Social Volume remained consistent over the past month but has reduced noticeably from March.
The Open Interest also rose higher to show speculators were gaining confidence in going long. Yet, the recovery has been slow compared to the fall in April.

The MVRV ratio showed that investors have been at a loss since the mid-March correction. It fell to -19% on the 14th of April and was at -3.83% at press time.

Meanwhile, the mean coin age continued to trend higher to signal network-wide accumulation. Together, they signaled a buying opportunity.
Worryingly, the dormant circulation spiked during the recent rally. This suggested increased token movement, likely for selling. This might hinder the bulls‚Äô attempts at a recovery and drag prices lower.

                        As hype builds that spot Ethereum ETF approvals in the USA might be imminent and Ether pushes to fresh two-month highs above $3,800, traders are hunting for the best crypto to buy now that might hand them the quickest gains in the current market environment.Multiple potential Ethereum ETF issuers submitted amended 19b-4 applications on Tuesday.And some tickers are already being listed on the DTCC.Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading a little lower in the past 24 hours around $70,200. Solana (SOL), meanwhile, dipped 4% back under $180.Attention will shift momentarily to the macro backdrop when the Fed releases the minutes of its April meeting on Wednesday.But Ethereum ETF newsflow will likely continue to dominate the headlines this week. That potentially leaves the market with significant near-term upside risks.Imagine Ethereum ETFs get approved and launched, and then demand is stronger than expected. That‚Äôs what happened with Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.Ethereum could be about to launch back above $4,000. Even though its up 35% up versus recent lows, ETH could still be the best crypto to buy now.That being said, some traders are hunting higher beta plays.Here are some strong-performing altcoins that might offer even greater upside potential than Ethereum.Best Crypto to Buy NowPepe (PEPE)Pepe (PEPE) has jumped more than 50% in the past two days to fresh record highs above $0.000014.Last at $0.00001375, its market cap is just under $5.8 billion as per CoinMarketCap.But Pepe could yet go higher. Traders appear to be piling into the token to express bets on Ethereum ecosystem growth.And Pepe still has a long way to go to catch up to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.It could still 5x from current levels this bull market. That makes Pepe potentially the best crypto to buy now.Arbitrum (ARB)A major underperformer since March, layer-2 Ethereum scaling blockchain Arbitrum‚Äôs ARB token is attempting to pick up.ARB recently surged back above $1.20 for the first time in a month. It‚Äôs also now back above its 21 and 50DMAs.ARB could thus be one of the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewQuick 2x gains could be instore for ARB, as traders bet on Ethereum ecosystem growth, which would directly benefit Arbitrum.Arbitrum is a leading Ethereum layer-2 protocol, but currently only has a market cap of around $3.2 billion.That leaves plenty of room for growth this bull market. ARB could thus be one of the best crypto to buy now.Uniswap (UNI)The native token of multi-chain DEX Uniswap (UNI) is another outperforming crypto since the SEC‚Äôs u-turn on Ethereum ETFs.Uniswap was recently hit by a Wells Notice from the agency. Its outperformance could be related to hopes the SEC takes a softer-than-initially-feared stance against them after the Ethereum u-turn.Either way, UNI is picking up fast and hard. The token was last at $9.65, up 25% in two days.A break above resistance either side of the $10 level could open the door to a further push higher.Indeed, UNI could soon retest yearly highs around $17, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now.Crypto Alternative to Consider ‚Äì Sealana (SEAL)
If Ethereum ETFs are coming, that could be a risk on trigger to start a new meme coin season.While Ethereum is currently in focus, Solana has been the go-to trading venue for meme coins this year.Established Solana meme coins like dogwifhat are a good bet. But their already bloated market caps reduce upside potential.For 50-100x gains, traders need to find newer meme coins.One new Solana meme coin that analysts at Cryptonews think has lots of potential is Sealana (SEAL).SEAL features an overweight, South Park-themed, Solana meme coin trading degen seal called¬†Sealana.The seal mascot has already attracted over $2.2 million in funds from eager investors.Sealana‚Äôs marketing and presale success is reminiscent of the recently launched Solana meme coin Slothana (SLOTH).Slothana raised over $15 million in a blockbuster presale.However, following launch, its token subsequently pumped to a market cap of over $100 million, as per¬†DEXTools.Rumors suggest the Slothana and Sealana teams are in some way related. Traders will thus be hoping SEAL matches SLOTH‚Äôs success.Investors can buy their SEAL by connecting their web3 wallet on¬†Sealana‚Äôs official website¬†with SOL, ETH, USDT, or USDC. Sealana is also available for purchase via card.Buy Sealana Here

                        The current Bitcoin bull market is falling short of the highs of 2017, Russian experts claimed on May 20.The comments came in a Bitcoin- and crypto-themed report from the Roscongress Foundation, one of Russia‚Äôs biggest development-focused NGOs and conference organizers.‚ÄòBitcoin Bull Market Fever Will Falter‚Äô ‚Äì Experts Weigh in
The report‚Äôs authors claimed that BTC‚Äôs new all-time-high peak in March this year was part of a ‚Äúspeculative game‚Äù played ‚Äúagainst the backdrop of spot Bitcoin ETFs approvals.‚ÄùHowever, March‚Äôs sudden growth in Bitcoin prices has since ‚Äúfailed to cause a stir similar to the situation at the end of 2017,‚Äù they wrote.The authors pointed to internet search engine queries ‚Äúrelated to cryptocurrencies,‚Äù which have ‚Äúremained well below peak values.‚ÄùThe authors added that only half as many people worldwide were searching for BTC and crypto-related themes in 2024 as was the case in 2017.Better Bitcoin Access Thanks to ETF Approval, Say Experts
Experts also noted that analysts had claimed spot Bitcoin ETFs would ‚Äúmake cryptocurrency investments more accessible to a wider range of people.‚ÄùAll-time Bitcoin prices. (Source: CoinMarketCap)But the evidence appears to suggest this has not yet happened, the foundation claimed.The authors explained that the ‚Äúmining-based transaction protocols of the Bitcoin network‚Äù are an ‚Äúobstacle‚Äù to ‚Äúfull inclusion‚Äù in the traditional financial system. The authors wrote:‚ÄúGenerally, cryptoassets are still a poor fit for full integration in the traditional financial system. The main thing holding back traders is the fact that cryptoassets are not suitable for offsetting.‚ÄùA Roscongress Foundation summit. Source: (RC Dreamteam/YouTube)In the financial world, offsetting (aka ‚Äúnetting‚Äù) refers to ‚Äúthe net presentation of separate assets and liabilities or income and expenses in the financial statements.‚ÄùThe foundation added that market data shows that most investors still see Bitcoin as a ‚Äúhigh-risk asset‚Äù in the same vein as ‚Äútech stocks.‚ÄùAdditionally, the authors claimed that BTC is ‚Äúmuch more strongly correlated with stock market movements‚Äù than with assets like gold. As such, it fits the profile of a ‚Äúclassic high-risk speculative asset.‚ÄùThe authors also spoke of a ‚Äúweak reaction‚Äù in the Bitcoin market to the April halving event,‚Äù and added:‚ÄúThe behavior of an asset is increasingly determined by the general level of willingness of financial market participants to take on risks.‚ÄùHowever, the report was not entirely downbeat about BTC or the effect of spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the United States. The authors wrote that in the long run:‚ÄúThe emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs will undoubtedly make investing in cryptocurrency more accessible to all market participants.‚ÄùBut they said temporary price rises were the result of ‚Äúspeculative play‚Äù from traders trying to capitalize on the ETF approvals in Washington.They added that the ‚Äúrange of Bitcoin price forecasts for the end of the year‚Äù was ‚Äúextremely wide.‚Äù The authors explained:‚ÄúAt the top end, the average maximum forecast is $121,764, while the average floor is $50,138.‚ÄùStablecoins Influencing Bitcoin Prices?

Bull Run Not Over Yet: Bitcoin Price Could Move to New All-Time High on New Short Squeeze, Willy Woo Says | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin has recently surged to surpass the $71,000 mark, while the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum moved up over 20% in a single day, with an analyst now suggesting an upcoming short squeeze could lead to new highs.



According to popular cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo, the price of BTC surged over 6.5% in a single day and ETH moved up to the $3,800 in a massive daily move over a short squeeze that liquidated one month of short positions on BTC.



That short squeeze, he suggested, could be followed by another one that would see the price of the flagship cryptocurrency moves to a new all-time high. Bitcoin, it‚Äôs worth noting, is currently very close to its all-time high, which was slightly above the $73,500 mark.







Data shows a dramatic decrease in short BTC positions within the last 24 hours, plummeting from 291 BTC to just 165, indicating that nearly half of these bearish bets were liquidated as Bitcoin‚Äôs price climbed rapidly. This triggered a cascade of buy orders from those scrambling to cover their short positions.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The catalyst for the broader market surge appears to be news related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds¬†update key filings¬†related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.



Before any trading can begin, issuers of spot Ether ETFs must receive the go-ahead on their S-1 registration statements, with the SEC having no set deadline to review these filings.



The SEC‚Äôs ongoing investigation into Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has intensified over the last few months, especially after the network‚Äôs transition to a Proof-of-Stake protocol.



Should Ether be classified as a security, it could provide the SEC with a basis to deny the applications for spot Ether ETFs.

Perennial Bitcoin HODLers Bought Big Ahead Of Rally: Data


								On-chain data shows that Bitcoin addresses with zero sales histories participated in a big accumulation before this recovery run started.
Bitcoin Inflows To Accumulation Addresses Sharply Spiked Recently
As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the accumulation addresses on the Bitcoin network have shown some significant inflow activity recently.
The ‚Äúaccumulation addresses‚Äù here refer to the Bitcoin wallets that have never made outgoing transactions on the blockchain. In other words, the accumulation addresses are basically the HODLers of the network.
Not every address with zero history of selling is included in this cohort, though, as there are some other requirements. The address must have at least two incoming transactions, the last of which must have occurred within the past seven years.

These exist because a wallet with only one transfer wouldn‚Äôt set a pattern one way or the other, and addresses that have been inactive for more than seven years are more likely to have reached old age by being lost rather than through HODLing.
Only the addresses holding greater than 10 BTC are counted under the accumulation addresses. Naturally, exchange‚Äîand miner-related wallets are excluded from this cohort, as they represent the perennial sell side of the market, which is on the opposite end of the spectrum from these HODLers.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin inflows going into the combined balance of this group over the past year or so:

The value of the indicator appears to have been quite high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant
As displayed in the above graph, these accumulation addresses saw extremely large inflows on the 15th of this month. More particularly, these HODLers received 17,800 BTC to their balance with this spike.
At the time of these inflows, the cryptocurrency price was around $61,600, so the purchases would have cost these investors almost $1.1 billion.
Interestingly, the asset‚Äôs price started on a recovery run soon after this buying spree, culminating¬†in the asset surpassing the $71,000 mark earlier in the past day.
The accumulation from these HODLers might have naturally been a factor behind the rally, but it most likely wasn‚Äôt the sole reason. Rather, it would appear that these are potentially smart-money investors who anticipated the rally, so they bought in at the lows.

The chart shows that the indicator registered two extreme spikes earlier in the year as well. Following both of these, the cryptocurrency witnessed some bullish price action.
The accumulation has certainly paid off for these Bitcoin HODLers this time, as the stack that they bought is now worth more than $1.24 billion.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $69,600, up 13% over the past week.

Altcoins ‚ÄòManiac Phase‚Äô Preparing, Analysts Call For Next Leg Up


																The crypto industry has seen a positive shift with the recent market recovery. After a Q1 full of bullish sentiment, Q2 saw many sectors of the crypto space brewing a pessimistic feeling toward altcoins.

	Related Reading



Experts and market watchers have reassured investors that the price corrections were part of the cycle, predicting that the bullish rally would resume after the cool-off. Now, analysts consider that altcoins are about to embark on a ‚Äúmassive leg higher‚Äù for the alt season.
Ethereum‚Äôs Surge Refuels Sentiment
The crypto market is up by 8.3%, with a market capitalization of $2.55 trillion. This market surge has seen Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, soar past $70,000 in the last day.
Similarly, the ‚Äúking of altcoins‚Äù remarkably performed these past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH)‚Äôs price has risen 22% since yesterday, surpassing levels not seen since mid-March.
However, ETH is yet to test its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, set nearly two years ago. As a result, the second-largest cryptocurrency has been criticized this cycle for being ‚Äúa major disappointment.‚Äù
In a turn of events, rumors of an approval of ETH spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have refueled investors‚Äô bullish tank, ‚Äúerasing 65 days of down only‚Äù with a single daily candle.
As ETH rallies, analysts believe it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the whole altcoins sector surges to kick off the altcoin season. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted the ‚ÄòCrypto Money Flow Cycle‚Äô, stating that, now that BTC and ETH have rallied, ‚Äúit‚Äôs time for Altcoins to rally.‚Äù
Is The Altcoins Season Here?
During the slowdowns, market watchers have analyzed altcoins‚Äô run this cycle. Altcoin Sherpa has stated that many tokens didn‚Äôt ‚Äúrun that hard‚Äù during round 1 of the bull run, resulting in his forecast of a 1-4 months ‚Äúcool-off‚Äù period before resuming the uptrend.
Despite the similarities with previous bull runs, the singularities of this cycle, like the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the Memecoin pre-sale frenzy, have made investors question whether they would see the alt season this time.
Nonetheless, several analysts, who urged investors not to panic before, suggest the community prepares for the ‚Äúmaniac phase‚Äù ahead. Crypto Yoddha shared his chart for the 2024 altcoin cycle, stating that the dip was ‚Äújust a higher low in an uptrend.‚Äù

Per the chart, the altcoins market is now looking to retest the $1.27 trillion resistance level seen in March before testing last cycle‚Äôs $1.7 trillion ATH. To crypto Yoddha, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre looking at the bullish continuation‚Äù that will lead to a new market ATH during round 2.
Similarly, Top analyst Micha√´l van de Poppe, who recently sold all his BTC for Altcoins, stated that the Altcoin market capitalization has finished its correction:
The next step: reaching all-time high, which is ~60-70% from here.
I think #Ethereum is likely reaching that in the next 2-4 months.

Lastly, Crypto Jelle considers that ‚ÄúAltcoins are about to embark on a massive leg higher‚Äù after an 18-month accumulation period. The analyst compared the market‚Äôs recent breakout to a ball being held underwater, claiming that ‚Äúit‚Äôs time for history to repeat.‚Äù

Ethereum is not the only reason why Uniswap [UNI] pumped 18% in 24 hours - AMBCrypto



UNI‚Äôs price surged after the protocol disclosed a plan to introduce the ERC-7683 standard.
Open Interest hit a monthly high, activity spiked, while the token could rise to $12.

Uniswap [UNI] broke out, rose by 18.98% and hit $9.30 in an unexpected move within the last 24 hours.
For many participants, the surge could be linked to the news that the odds for the U.S. SEC to approve Ethereum [ETH] spot ETFs had increased. Because of this, ETH‚Äôs price jumped.
While that played a part, that was not the only reason. According to AMBCrypto‚Äôs investigation, a major development and other happenings on-chain were vital to UNI‚Äôs breakout.
The Labs come with a new standard
On the 20th of May, Uniswap Labs disclosed that it was introducing a new token standard called the ERC-7683. For context, ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment.
It is a standard for creating and issuing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
According to Uniswap Labs, the standard, if deployed, would solve fragmentation on the network and improve cross-chain interaction. The proposal read,
‚ÄúBy implementing a standard, cross-chain intents systems can interoperate and share infrastructure such as order dissemination services and filler networks.‚Äù
Moments after the announcement, UNI‚Äôs Open Interest (OI) increased. At press time, the OI was $64.90 million. This was a value that the metric has not reached for over a month.
Source: Santiment
Increasing OI indicates that more money is coming into the market. On the other hand, a decreasing OI is a sign of decreasing net positions with liquidity moving out.
Activity rises, sets UNI for another price boost
When put side by side with the price, the OI was a sign that buyers in the market were aggressive. If the value continues to rise, UNI‚Äôs price might do the same.
Furthermore, the prediction that the token could rally higher than its March high could come to pass. However, there were other changes on the network that propelled the hike apart from the OI.
One of them was the 24-hour active addresses. Whenever active addresses increase, it means that a large number of users are interacting with the blockchain.
If the metric falls, it means that the number of unique addresses visiting the network is decreasing. For UNI, on-chain data from Santiment showed that active addresses rose to a weekly high of 1926
This sudden surge indicates rising confidence among holders. Most times, this leads to increased buying activity and was surely one of the reasons UNI‚Äôs price moved northward.
Source: Santiment

Realistic or not, here‚Äôs UNI‚Äôs market cap in ETH terms

In addition, AMBCrypto got confirmation of the increased interest from the volume. At press time, UNI‚Äôs volume was $346.65 million.
Should this figure increase while the token‚Äôs price rises, then UNI could hit a higher value. Considering the momentum, the price of the cryptocurrency might hit between $12 and $15 within a short period.

                        Fraudsters are targetting South Korean crypto users with an Ethereum-themed scam, token holders in the country said on May 21.According to the South Korean media outlet Asia Time, scammers are sending alarming text messages to smartphone users, warning them that their ETH coins will be ‚Äúburned‚Äù on May 22 if they do not act fast.
Ethereum-themed Crypto Scam ‚ÄòOriginating from Bogus Exchanges‚Äô
The scam comes as police and regulators report that ‚Äúcybercrime relating to virtual assets‚Äù is ‚Äúon the rise.‚ÄùCrypto community members took to online meeting places to warn fellow token holders that a ‚Äúphishing text message‚Äù was circulating. One post warned:
‚ÄúYou could easily fall for it, so be careful.‚ÄùSome warned that scammers use technology that allows their messages to bypass spam filters.Some of the text messages claim to originate from a ‚Äúglobal cryptocurrency exchange‚Äù named Bit-Finance.The messages warn that ‚Äúdue to‚Äù token holders‚Äô ‚Äúlong-term inactivity,‚Äù their Ethereum holdings ‚Äúwill be burned on May 22.‚ÄùEthereum vs the USD over the past five days. (Source: TradingView)The message informs crypto holders that they should ‚Äúmake withdrawals as soon as possible‚Äù to avoid losing their funds.Recipients are prompted to click on a link that will help them understand the process and safeguard their funds.
Community Members Post Warnings
One community member posted a screenshot showing that the senders claimed a total of ETH 54.5 of their funds would be burned if they did not act.The link enclosed appears to navigate smartphone users to a phishing site, where scammers attempt to prompt people to enter wallet details and passwords.The media outlet noted that ‚Äúcyber ‚Äã‚Äãfraud using real virtual assets is increasing‚Äù in South Korea.Last year, the National Police Agency said that it had dealt with 167,688 cyber fraud cases over the course of the year. That represents a 7.68% increase on 2022 figures.‚ÄúCrimes using virtual assets‚Äù accounted for 38.3% of the 2023 total, the police agency explained.Citizens have also filed a total of 2,209 reports to the regulatory Financial Supervisory Service from January to April this year.In each case, victims claimed they had suffered financial losses because of crypto scammers.The regulator said that 17.7% of these cases are related to phishing attacks. It has previously claimed that crypto-themed phishing is ‚Äúrampant‚Äù in South Korea.
Police Vow to ‚ÄòFight Back‚Äô
Police experts said the rise in attacks was an ‚Äúopportunistic‚Äù move from scammers, with crypto markets buoyant.In recent months, South Korean markets were spurred when many exchanges began offering commission-free crypto trading.This, experts agreed, has also led to a rise in transaction volumes ‚Äì and a subsequent rise in phishing attacks.An official from the Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãInvestigation Unit at the National Police Agency said that crypto criminals were increasingly making use of so-called ‚Äúdaepo phones.‚ÄùThis term refers to cell phone numbers created using stolen name and social security number credentials. The official said:
‚ÄúRecently, fraud has become more sophisticated. There has been an increase in virtual asset-related crimes using daepo phones, and chat apps like KakaoTalk and Telegram. However, we are fighting back. We are using investigation methods that track the flow of transactions.‚ÄùLast month, South Korean media outlets reported that phishing attackers are now carefully targeting credit card users and the victims of crypto scams.Typically, these attackers try to drive their victims onto fake crypto exchanges and wallet platforms.

Dogecoin: Is a major rally coming? Key levels that say yes - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin‚Äôs current trading momentum and a symmetrical triangle pattern indicate a possible breakout above key resistance levels.
Increased Open Interest and volume suggest strong market activity, with potential for Dogecoin to hit the $0.3 mark.

Dogecoin [DOGE] has been experiencing a notable increase in market value, trading at $0.1641, marking an 8.6% rise over the past 24 hours, and extending its weekly gain to nearly 10% at press time. 
This uptrend aligned with the broader bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, drawing increased attention and investment into the meme coin.¬†
The surge in Dogecoin‚Äôs price is not only a reflection of current market dynamics, but also a sign of growing investor confidence in the asset‚Äôs potential for further gains.
Amid this positive market trend, analysts have spotted significant technical patterns in Dogecoin‚Äôs price movements. 
Particularly, Crypto Daily Trade Signals, a well-known crypto analyst, has spotted a symmetrical triangle pattern on the Dogecoin chart.¬†
¬†
Source: Crypto Daily Trade Signals/X
This pattern is often seen as a consolidation phase that precedes a breakout or breakdown in price, indicating that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of continuing its upward trajectory.
Dogecoin: Technical analysis and future projections
The symmetrical triangle pattern identified by analysts suggested that Dogecoin faced a major resistance level at $0.1545, while the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) provides strong support at $0.1513.¬†
At press time, Dogecoin‚Äôs market price was above this 50-day EMA, suggesting a bullish trend. 
However, for this upward trend to be confirmed, Dogecoin needs to break past the resistance at $0.1595, as pointed out by Crypto Daily Trade Signals.
Further supporting this bullish outlook, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above the 50 mark, indicating a buying trend in the market. 
Dogecoin‚Äôs immediate resistance levels are at $0.1595, followed by $0.1698 and $0.1844. If Dogecoin can successfully overcome these levels, it could pave the way for more significant price increases.¬†
On the other hand, if the price falls below the pivot point around $0.15100, caution is advised, though the current RSI suggests there is room for profit.
Open interest in Dogecoin has also seen a significant increase, up by 16.64% in the past 24 hours, with a current value of $946.56 million.
Rising interest
This rise in Open Interest, accompanied by a nearly 100% increase in volume to $2.76 billion in the past day, underscored the growing market activity and investor interest in Dogecoin.
Source: Coinglass
Despite the bullish metrics, not all market participants are benefiting from the current trend. Dogecoin‚Äôs total liquidations sit at over $400,000, with long traders experiencing the majority of these losses. 
This points to a market that, while trending upwards, still presents risks, especially for those on the wrong side of price movements.

Looking ahead, Dogecoin‚Äôs price chart indicates a potential breakout from the previous lower low around $0.168.

If Dogecoin can breach this level, a minor retracement might follow, potentially setting the stage for a strong upward movement.¬†

AMBCrypto‚Äôs recent analysis supported this view, suggesting that a breakout above the $0.166‚Äì$0.17 range could clear the path for Dogecoin to approach the $0.3 mark.

Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.5650.
Another Decline in ADA?

XRP extended its increase above the $0.5450 resistance zone.
The price is now trading above $0.5250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5330 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair is correcting gains, but there could be a fresh increase unless there is a close below the 100-hourly SMA.

XRP Price Holds Ground
After a close above the $0.520 level, XRP price remained in a positive zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It cleared the $0.5320 and $0.5450 resistance levels. There was also a spike above the $0.550 level.
A new weekly high was formed at $0.5571, and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $0.5450 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $0.5065 swing low to the $0.5571 high.

Immediate resistance is near the $0.5380 level. The first key resistance is near $0.5450. A close above the $0.5450 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.5570. If the bulls push the price above the $0.5570 resistance level, there could be a steady increase toward the $0.5650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5720 resistance.
More Losses?
If XRP fails to clear the $0.5450 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5330 level and the trend line. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $0.5065 swing low to the $0.5571 high.
The next major support is at $0.5250. The main support is now near $0.5185. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5185 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could drop and test the $0.5065 support in the near term.

Diamond Hands? Trader Turns $1,360 into $2.3 Million with Little-Known Solana-Based Token | Cryptoglobe


                                
A ‚Äòdiamond trader‚Äô has managed to, over the course of five months, turn around $1,360 into over $2.3 million to secure a gain of over 170,000% after spending 12 Solana (SOL) tokens to buy a meme-inspired cryptocurrency late last year.



According to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the trader bought 5.21 million $PONKE tokens on December 24, 2024 and has since held onto them as the price of the cryptocurrency rose, with their holdings now being worth $2.32 million.







The price of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency has recently surged amid a wider cryptocurrency market rally that saw the space add over $200 billion to its market capitalization.



The catalyst for the broader market surge appears to be news related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds¬†update key filings¬†related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Before any trading can begin, issuers of spot Ether ETFs must receive the go-ahead on their S-1 registration statements, with the SEC having no set deadline to review these filings.



The SEC‚Äôs ongoing investigation into Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has intensified over the last few months, especially after the network‚Äôs transition to a Proof-of-Stake protocol.



Should Ether be classified as a security, it could provide the SEC with a basis to deny the applications for spot Ether ETFs.

Miss the Notcoin pump? Better focus on L1 tokens!



                    

The market has been quite chaotic over the last couple of weeks. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 23% but has been gaining positions during the last week. As always, Bitcoin is the driver of the crypto space; once it moves, we can expect the rest of the coins to start gaining momentum.







The exceptions, as always, are new projects. The launch of Notcoin, a tokenized equivalent of game points that people were collecting on a Telegram game, was eagerly awaited by more than 5 million people. However, as we can see in the graphic, it followed a typical pattern for new projects: a huge spike followed by a sell-off. This is when market makers primarily generate revenue. After this initial phase, we typically see a steady decline in price as market makers consolidate their positions before the next possible move. We can expect the price to drop to around 0.0035. It‚Äôs likely we will see frequent pumps and dumps with this asset.








For those looking for a more stable but steadily growing portfolio, I would suggest focusing on Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) tokens, as their potential to rise is quite significant over the next couple of weeks, assuming Bitcoin continues its climb towards all-time highs.



Now, let‚Äôs review some potential tokens that are consolidating at the bottom and have not yet started their upward movement. Here are a few interesting options: Arbitrum, Aptos, Sui, and Vara. We can see that the tokens of all these projects have reached support levels and are now rebounding. But which one of them has the most potential?



Please note, this is not investment advice. I am merely analyzing the information the graphics provide.




Arbitrum



ARB dropped 60.66% from the local high when this correction started. We can see it had a false breakout with two candles, but there was no impulse, and it is once more consolidating near the level of 0.8981. If there is no rebound in the next two days, it is highly likely we will see ARB‚Äôs price drop to 0.7705.







Aptos



APT dropped 62% during this correction. It is highly likely that we will still see it go down to 7.3, with a significant possibility of a false breakout. Thus, in the next couple of days, a downtrend is highly probable, with consolidation around the level of 7.34, including a false breakout towards the level of 6.78.








Sui



SUI experienced a drop close to 60%, similar to its peers, but managed to stop at 59.37%. It had a nice rebound at the level of 0.8856 and is showing good bullish signals. This token is definitely worth watching.







Vara network



VARA proved to be one of the strongest tokens among its peers, dropping just 51.26%. It is consolidating around 0.07753, and as we can see, we can expect a rebound towards the level of 0.099 over the next couple of days. Vara has shown strong impulse movements and a steadier downtrend. So, while this is not investment advice, this token should definitely be on our watch list.







In conclusion, I would closely monitor VARA, as it has significant potential and appears to be underestimated by the market for now. SUI also looks promising with its rising possibilities.

Trump‚Äôs 2024 Campaign Now Welcomes Crypto Donations


On May 21, former US President Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign launched a fundraising page allowing federally permissible donors to contribute using cryptocurrency via Coinbase Commerce.
Trump‚Äôs embrace of crypto signals a sharp contrast with the current administration‚Äôs stance on digital assets.
Trump‚Äôs Campaign Accepts Up to 8 Cryptocurrencies

According to the campaign‚Äôs announcement, supporters can visit the designated website to make donations to the Trump campaign with crypto. All contribution limits and disclosure requirements for crypto donations will adhere to Federal Election Commission regulations.
In the announcement, Trump‚Äôs campaign emphasized that he aims ‚Äúto reduce government control over Americans‚Äô financial decision-making. He also sees accepting crypto donations reflects his ‚Äúcommitment to an agenda that values individual freedom over increased socialistic government control.‚Äù

‚ÄúBiden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an ‚Äòanti-crypto army‚Äô to restrict Americans‚Äô right to make their own financial choices. MAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army, moving the campaign to victory on November 5!‚Äù The announcement reads.


The statement citing MAGA is particularly interesting, given that MAGA is a Trump-themed meme coin. It seems that Trump wants to symbolize the campaign‚Äôs embrace of crypto through this asset.
The campaign accepts several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), USDC, XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), 0x (ZRX), and Shiba Inu (SHIBA). Supporters can donate in custom amounts or select from predefined options such as $20.24, $2,024, $45, $47, and $4547. The 45 and 47 numbers represent Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign message that he was the 45th president of the US and aims to be the 47th president.

However, it is important to note that while the announcement claimed Trump as the ‚Äúfirst major party nominee‚Äù to accept crypto donations, he is not the official nominee until July. Additionally, in 2015, Senator Rand Paul from the Republican Party accepted Bitcoin donations for his presidential campaign.
This move follows Trump‚Äôs promise at a recent event at Mar-a-Lago, where he assured supporters they could donate in crypto. He also pledged a more welcoming approach to the crypto industry, criticizing current US regulatory measures as ‚Äúhostility.‚Äù

His current crypto-focused political move comes when President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration shows a tougher stance toward the digital assets industry. This shift is notable, considering Trump was a crypto skeptic during his first presidency from 2017 to 2021.
Nonetheless, many believe that Trump‚Äôs presidency could bring a positive outlook for the crypto industry. BeInCrypto previously reported that Standard Chartered‚Äôs researcher Geoffrey Kendrick noted that Trump‚Äôs administration might adopt less stringent regulatory measures for crypto than the current Biden administration.

This potential policy shift could encourage foreign official buyers of US treasuries to explore alternative financial assets like Bitcoin. Such exploration could potentially drive its price upwards.

Bitcoiners Scoff At Gold Bull Peter Schiff's Theory That Ethereum ETF Approvals Could Sink BTC - Benzinga

Gold bull and staunch Bitcoin BTC/USD critic, Peter Schiff, used the recent euphoria around Ethereum ETH/USD spot ETF approvals to attack King Crypto's prospects.What Happened: Schiff wrote in an X post that a potential Ether spot ETF approval could be a bearish event for the world's largest cryptocurrency.He argued, "But any money to buy new Ether ETFs will most likely come from existing Bitcoin ETFs. Investors who decided to make an allocation to crypto won‚Äôt increase that allocation to buy Ether."Put simply, Schiff argued that the existing Bitcoin ETF investors would eventually sell their shares and reallocate them to new Ether ETFs rather than keeping both in their portfolios.¬†Why It Matters: Bitcoin proponents were not amused by the commentary, with one user, Rajat Soni, taking it upon himself to educate the Bitcoin skeptic. He reminded Schiff of Bitcoin's dominant position in the market and that its pump was unrelated to developments around Ether ETFs.¬†"Bitcoin‚Äôs price doesn‚Äôt go up because of Ether. Ether‚Äôs price goes up because of Bitcoin," Soni asserted.¬†Another user named¬†Joby Anderson¬†replied to Schiff that an ETH ETF approval would¬†‚Äújust¬†signal to investors that regulatory risk is improving¬†and ‚Ä¶ promote additional outside investment.¬†You know this.‚ÄùBitcoin rallied over $70,000 amid net inflows of nearly $548 million into spot ETFs this week, according to data from SoSo Value. The eleven investment vehicles tracking the spot prices of Bitcoin have raked in around $12.88 billion since their listing in early January.Schiff's skepticism stands antithetical to Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood's forecast of Bitcoin hitting $3.8 million by 2030, provided institutional investors allocate 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin.¬†¬†Price Action: Bitcoin was trading down 1.6% at $69952, as of 11:55 pm ET, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Trump Accepts Cryptocurrency Donations In Bitcoin, Ethereum, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin And More, Says MAGA Supporters ‚ÄòWill Build A Crypto Army‚ÄôPhoto via Shutterstock

Uniswap Labs Challenges SEC's Claims: Gears Up For Court Battle



	

Key Points:




Uniswap Labs disputes US SEC allegations.



UNI and LP tokens are claimed not to be securities.



Uniswap is ready to defend its stance in court.




Uniswap Labs challenges SEC‚Äôs charges on allegations that its UNI and LP tokens are not securities. The firm is ready to defend itself against the claims in court.





Uniswap Labs has reportedly challenged allegations brought against the company by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The New York-based startup disputes a claim that the company operates as an unregistered exchange and broker-dealer.



Uniswap Labs Challenges SEC‚Äôs Allegations



The SEC‚Äôs Enforcement Division sent a Wells notice last month, signaling the intention to recommend legal action against Uniswap Labs.



Marvin Ammori, the chief legal officer at Uniswap Labs, told a press conference that the SEC based the case on the incorrect assumption that all tokens are securities.




Ammori clarified that tokens are a file format and not a security per se. The chief legal officer also warned the commission that legal action risks an adverse decision and possibly clipping the commission‚Äôs wings as far as the authority to regulate crypto tokens is concerned.

Tokens are Not Securities, Says Uniswap‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer



Uniswap Labs argues that the UNI tokens the governance token for Uniswap are not securities under the Howey Test, the legal guideline defining investment contracts.



The company also states that LP tokens special tokens awarded to users contributing to liquidity pools on Uniswap are not securities but accounting tools that keep track of a user‚Äôs assets and any fees they might earn.





Ammori said that Uniswap Labs was ready to defend the company‚Äôs position in court: ‚ÄúWe will litigate if we have to, and if we litigate, we will win.‚Äù



All these happen while SEC Chairman Gary Gensler continues to insist that the regulator has the authority over digital assets, mostly unregistered securities, according to his claims, which are under the rule of the SEC.

Donald Trump's Presidential Campaign Now Allowed To Donate Using Cryptocurrency - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign now accepts cryptocurrency donations, which is the first for a major party candidate.



The campaign aims to counter Biden and Warren‚Äôs anti-crypto positions and attract young male voters.



Accepting various cryptocurrencies opens a new funding source for Trump‚Äôs campaign.




According to CNBC, Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign announced on Tuesday that it will start accepting donations in various cryptocurrencies.





Donald Trump‚Äôs Presidential Campaign Embraces Cryptocurrency Donations



The decision aligns with Trump‚Äôs pledge to embrace digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ether, positioning him as the first major party candidate to do so.



Supporters can donate using any cryptocurrency accepted through Coinbase Commerce, according to a campaign press release. This initiative follows Trump‚Äôs declaration of support for crypto at a recent Mar-a-Lago gala, marking the digital currencies‚Äô entry into the 2024 campaign.



The announcement also targets President Joe Biden, linking him to Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent crypto critic. Warren has campaigned to build an ‚Äúanti-crypto army‚Äù to restrict cryptocurrency use, a stance that Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign plans to counter with its own ‚Äúcrypto army.‚Äù




New Fundraising Avenue Through Digital Currencies



‚ÄúThis new cryptocurrency option will help build a crypto army, pushing our campaign towards victory on November 5th,‚Äù the campaign stated. The move could tap into a new funding stream for Trump‚Äôs campaign, which has lagged behind Biden in cash reserves despite strong fundraising efforts in April.



Crypto donations to Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign will be treated as in-kind contributions, akin to stock gifts, and are subject to Federal Election Commission regulations on contribution limits and disclosures. The campaign can choose to liquidate the digital assets or hold onto them.



Trump has made previous efforts to engage the crypto community, which tends to be younger and more male. In December, he released NFT trading cards available for purchase with cryptocurrency, and earlier this month, he hosted a dinner for NFT supporters at Mar-a-Lago, urging them to vote for him.



Meanwhile, the Biden campaign has maintained a skeptical stance toward cryptocurrencies. Hours before Trump‚Äôs announcement, Biden‚Äôs team sent a fundraising text warning that ‚Äúcryptocurrency executives and oil barons are backing Trump.‚Äù





While Trump promotes himself as the first major party nominee to embrace crypto donations, he follows in the footsteps of other candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Senator Rand Paul, who previously accepted Bitcoin donations.

Bitcoin mining - Here's why this group is still holding as BTC falls below $70K - AMBCrypto



The Bitcoin miner reserve has increased to its highest level since April.
BTC has fallen below $70K once again.

Recently, Bitcoin [BTC] mining difficulty has decreased, but miners‚Äô revenue has also declined. 
Despite this drop in revenue, miners have yet to start selling off their holdings, even with BTC falling below the $70,000 mark. They are choosing to hold onto their Bitcoin for now.
Bitcoin mining revenue and difficulty declines
According to data from Blockchain.com, Bitcoin mining difficulty has remained flat for several days. 
The chart analysis shows that the difficulty began decreasing around the 7th of May and continued until the 10th of May. Since then, it has stabilized.
 This implies that solving the block puzzle to add new blocks now requires less time and fewer resources.
Additionally, over 30 days ago, BTC miner revenue surged to over $107 million but then experienced a sharp decline, dropping to $26.4 million by the 1st of May. 
At press time, it was attempting to recover, likely supported by the recent rise in BTC prices, and sat around $34.1 million. This level of revenue is similar to what it was in December 2023.
Miner reserve increase in value
AMBCrypto‚Äôs analysis of the Bitcoin miner reserve indicated that it has remained stable over the past few days, holding around 1.816 million BTC at press time. 
Although there have been occasional declines, the reserve has maintained this level since the 6th of May.¬†
However, the value of this reserve has significantly increased in recent days. The chart showed that the reserve‚Äôs value rose from approximately $120 billion to over $129 billion by the 20th of May. 
As of this writing, the reserve‚Äôs value is around $129.2 billion.
Source: CryptoQuant
Bitcoin falls below $70k
The increase in the value of the Bitcoin miner reserve is due to the spike in BTC‚Äôs prices. On the 20th of May, the price of BTC surged from around $66,000 to over $71,000, a rise of more than 7%. 

Read Bitcoin‚Äôs [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

However, at press time, BTC had fallen back to approximately $69K, with a decline of 2% in the last 24 hours.¬†
This price range means that miners‚Äô holdings have become more valuable, even if the volume of their holdings has not significantly increased.

Major Worldwide News Update:			Ethereum saw a significant surge amid growing anticipation for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.

Grayscale Investments, in line with other entities, decided to remove staking from its Ethereum ETF proposal. Fidelity similarly omitted staking from its application.

Ethereum ETF Approval Unlikely This Week, Says Top Crypto Analyst: 72-Hour Window 'Weird And Almost Impossible To Establish' - Benzinga

Popular cryptocurrency analyst and trader¬†Micha√´l van de Poppe¬†went against the¬†broader market sentiment¬†by suggesting that spot¬†Ethereum¬†ETH/USD ETFs won't be greenlighted by the SEC this week.What Happened:¬†Van de Poppe, known for sharing crypto investment strategies on social media, said, "Honestly, I think it‚Äôs going to be a delay and approval in July/August," amid the ongoing frenzy. The analyst's views drew market interest as the final deadline for the first wave of applications falls on May 23, with VanEck‚Äòs proposal being the first in line.Van de Poppe told Benzinga that the likelihood of approval within a window of 72 hours is "weird and almost impossible to establish." He cited the continued presence of ETH staking in many applications as a factor that could delay approvals. He added that the market would likely respond negatively to the SEC‚Äôs refusal, but the grounds for denial would determine the next reaction."If it‚Äôs solely the staking part, then it might suggest that we‚Äôre going to have an approval, but just later on, and that would automatically lead to a positive build-up at a later point in time," Van de Poppe emphasized.Why It Matters:¬†After a few hours of receiving the aforementioned responses, nearly five applicants amended their filings to remove the staking part ‚Äî a blockade that Van de Poppe was referring to.Bloomberg Analyst¬†James Seyffart¬†maintained a 75% approval chance as of this publication. Meanwhile, VanEck's spot Ether ETF fund was listed on the website of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation,¬†according¬†to The Block. While not a confirmation of approval, this step was important in the process of listing the investment vehicles.Price Action:¬†At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading up 3.26% at $3,759.04, according to¬†data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoiners Scoff At Gold Bull Peter Schiff‚Äôs Theory That Ethereum ETF Approvals Could Sink BTCImage via Shutterstock

Trump Adopts Bitcoin, ETH, XRP, Dogecoin, SHIB For Donations


								Former US President Donald J. Trump has announced that his campaign will accept donations in Bitcoin and various cryptocurrencies, marking a significant milestone as the first major party Presidential nominee to employ this strategy for fundraising. The announcement came via an official campaign press release.
The Trump campaign‚Äôs new fundraising initiative integrates the use of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). These can now be donated through Coinbase Commerce, a service that allows merchants to accept multiple cryptocurrencies directly into a user-controlled wallet.


Trump Goes All In On Bitcoin And Crypto
According to the campaign‚Äôs press release, the move adds ‚Äúto President Trump‚Äôs already groundbreaking digital fundraising operation [and] marks the first time a major party Presidential nominee has embraced cryptocurrency for donations.‚Äù This initiative is not just a broadening of the campaign‚Äôs digital fundraising operation but also a strong political statement in favor of Bitcoin and crypto‚Äôs role in enhancing financial freedom and innovation.

The campaign contrasts its embrace of cryptocurrency with the positions of key Democratic opponents, particularly President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who have expressed significant skepticism towards the utility and regulation of digital currencies. The press release specifically calls out Senator Warren‚Äôs efforts to curtail the crypto sector, which she has often described as a ‚Äòshadowy system‚Äô that needs more stringent regulation.
‚ÄúBiden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an ‚Äòanti-crypto army‚Äô to restrict Americans‚Äô right to make their own financial choices. MAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th!,‚Äù the press release states.
David Bailey, the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, who developed the Bitcoin agenda with the Trump campaign, commented via X, highlighting the significance of this move: ‚ÄúOnly the start of the Trump news.‚Äù

He added, ‚ÄúMax the individual contribution to Trump, make sure to pay in bitcoin or crypto. We have his attention right now. Many decisions are being made. We want to validate this move with impressive numbers and keep him moving‚Ä¶ Everything is on the table right now. 3,000 people max out their individual contribution over the next 48 hrs (adds up to ~$10m) Trump is going to be blown away.‚Äù
The Trump campaign has clarified that all crypto contributions will adhere strictly to Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations. These donations will be reported as in-kind contributions, similar to gifts of stock, providing a transparent framework for how these funds will be accounted for. Donors are directed to a specific page on Trump‚Äôs official campaign website where they can complete their transactions through Coinbase Commerce, choosing from a wide range of crypto options.
This strategic move comes at a critical time as Trump‚Äôs campaign finances have shown robust growth, even outpacing President Biden in April fundraising totals, according to reports. However, Biden‚Äôs campaign still maintains a larger reserve of cash on hand. By opening up the campaign to crypto donations, Trump is not only diversifying his fundraising options, but potentially tapping into crypto voters who are single-issue voters.
While the Trump campaign claims to be the first major party nominee to accept cryptocurrencies, it‚Äôs important to note that other political figures have also engaged with crypto. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., running an independent presidential campaign, and Senator Rand Paul in his 2015 presidential campaign, both accepted Bitcoin. However, the scope and variety of cryptocurrencies now accepted by the Trump campaign set a new precedent in terms of the breadth of digital assets involved.

US Market Dominates Bitcoin Trading Amid ETF Boom


Bitcoin trading during US market hours has surged to unprecedented levels, accounting for 46% of this year‚Äôs cumulative volume from January to April.
This increase in trading activity is closely linked to the January launch of spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
US Dominates Bitcoin Trading, Asia Lags Behind

Kaiko Research highlights that the volume of Bitcoin trading spikes at the beginning and close of US trading hours. This pattern correlates with the calculation of net asset values for the ETFs at the close of US stock exchanges each weekday. 
Additionally, Thursdays see the highest share of trading during US hours, contributing nearly 15% of the cumulative daily volume.
While Bitcoin trading volume during US hours has rebounded to 2022 levels, volume during Asian trading hours remains significantly lower, Kaiko found. This shift indicates the growing influence of US market activities on Bitcoin trading dynamics.

Additionally, Toby Winterflood, Chief Product Officer of crypto data firm ‚Äì CCData, noted that the performance of Bitcoin during US market hours reflects muted volatility compared to previous periods. 

‚ÄúThat literally shows you the impact that these ETFs have had, not only on Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the S&P, but also its potential de-correlation with other altcoins and other cryptos,‚Äù Winterflood said.

The spot-Bitcoin ETFs have drawn nearly $13 billion in net inflows since their launch four months ago. This makes them one of the most successful product category debuts in industry history. 
Although demand has slowed, with a net $1.3 billion inflow so far in May, the pace seems to be picking up again. In the past two days alone, these ETFs have recorded a cumulative net flow of $542.9 million.
Currently, Bitcoin is trading around the psychological resistance level of $70,000. According to a report by Hashkey, Bitcoin returned five times the S&P 500 from January to April 2024. 

Bitcoin, representing 53% of the entire crypto market cap, delivered a 57% return year-to-date. Whereas S&P 500 recorded 12.20% growth in the same period.

Bitcoin‚Äôs typically lower volatility compared to other crypto assets highlights its unique position within the market. Many other crypto assets have returned multiples of Bitcoin‚Äôs performance, reflecting the broader volatility and potential rewards within the crypto sector.

                        Donald Trump has reportedly become the first presumptive Republican presidential nominee to accept cryptos for official campaign donations.The former US President on Tuesday, launched a crypto fundraising page for eligible donors to contribute using the Coinbase Commerce product. The move comes weeks after he declared as the candidate for cryptocurrency at Mar-a-Lago gala that thrust crypto into the 2024 campaign.Per the crypto donation portal, crypto assets including Bitcoin, (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ripple (XRP), USD Coin (USDC) and Ox (ZRX) are accepted currently.Crypto donations are subject to standard contribution disclosure requirements from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). That said, it isn‚Äôt clear whether the Trump campaign will hold onto the crypto or plans to sell it.The statement further said that the move is a ‚Äúpart of a seismic shift toward freedom.‚Äù The announcement ‚Äúreflects Trump‚Äôs commitment to an agenda that values freedom over socialistic government control,‚Äù it added.Julia Krieger, a Coinbase spokeswoman, told The Associated Press that the platform is open to all candidates this election season. ‚ÄúCrypto is nonpartisan and moves money forward because it‚Äôs cheaper and faster,‚Äù she added.Interestingly, the likely GOP flag bearer in the upcoming US elections, isn‚Äôt the first presidential candidate to accept cryptocurrency donations.Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from ‚ÄòWe The People,‚Äô announced in May 2023 that his campaign would accept BTC donations. Republican Senator Rand Paul, accepted BTC donations in its 2015 campaign.Building a ‚ÄòCrypto Army‚Äô
With the new crypto donation option, Trump supporters are planning to build a ‚Äòcrypto army‚Äô to fight with the ‚Äúanti-crypto army‚Äù that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has campaigned on.Although Trump is yet to propose any concrete pro-crypto policies, his supporters are already accepting the positive voices in favor of the nascent asset class. This is possibly due to Biden‚Äôs administration taking the anti-crypto stance in the past.The Biden administration has taken a cautious approach to cryptos. For instance, in 2022, Biden signed an Executive Order, which aims to develop digital assets in a responsible manner. The Order called on government agencies to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies, with a focus on consumer protection, financial stability and CBDCs.Trump‚Äôs Skepticism on Cryptos
Donald Trump, while in office, has expressed some skepticism about cryptos. In 2019, he said that he was ‚Äúnot a fan of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.‚Äù He strongly supported the US Dollars, calling it the ‚Äúonly real currency‚Äù in the US.‚Äú[Cryptos] are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.‚ÄùHowever, an official filing that circulated in October 2023 revealed that¬†Trump holds between $250,000 to $500,000 in digital assets, and that he held a majority of assets in Ethereum.Early this year, the former Prez said he would never allow the creation of a CBDC, calling it a ‚Äúdangerous threat to freedom.‚Äù

Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE) Will Surge 11,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gold Pepe presents a similar opportunity.



Gold Pepe has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days before it will be listed on KuCoin ‚Äì a massive cryptocurrency exchange ‚Äì and Gold Pepe could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Gold Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Gold Pepe on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gold Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 5EZoavSMtfuq3dQuyQsYqUgmD7avZJEZMYpLtpZFBgYz ‚Äì in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GOLDPEPE.

Ethereum ETF Issuers Amend SEC Forms, But Launches May Take Months


																‚ÄúIt‚Äôs happening,‚Äù exclaimed Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart on May 22 who added that at least five of the potential ETH ETF issuers have submitted their amended 19b-4s to the Securities and Exchange Commission a few hours ago.
Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco Galaxy, Ark 21Shares, and Franklin all submitted amendments via the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).
Grayscale filed an updated 19b-4 for their Ethereum Mini Trust earlier in the day.


Not So Fast
The flurry of activity follows an advisory from the SEC to submit revised 19b-4 forms by May 21. A 19b-4 is a form filed by ETF issuers and exchanges proposing to change rules or introduce new products, in this case, spot Ethereum ETPs.
May 23 is the first final deadline for SEC approval or denial for the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF.
It is still a potentially long way from a launch, said Seyffart before adding, ‚ÄúThese filings prove that all of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate.‚Äù
However, there needs to be SEC approval orders on all of the 19b-4s then the regulator needs to approve the S-1 applications, which could take ‚Äúweeks or more before ETFs launch,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúSeeing broad misconceptions that ‚Äòapprovals‚Äô mean immediate launches of the #Ethereum ETFs. This isn‚Äôt necessarily the case. There will be days (at a minimum), likely at least weeks, and potentially months between approval and launches here.‚Äù
An S-1 is the initial registration form required for new securities offered to the public. They provide the SEC and potential investors with detailed information about the company‚Äôs business operations and products.
The major amendments submitted involved removing anything related to Ethereum staking from the ETF filings, which the SEC has vetoed for these products.
If the issuers could stake the ETH in the funds, they could potentially offer investors greater returns but the regulator was having none of it, still asserting that Ether is a security.
Seyffart maintained approval odds at 75% following an upgrade from 25% earlier this week.
‚ÄúAlso ‚Äî Yes ‚Äî our approval odds are still at 75%. Not that it even means anything anymore haha.‚Äù
Meanwhile, ETF Store President Nate Geraci did not think that the last-minute SEC U-turn was politically motivated.
ETH Price Outlook
Ethereum prices topped $3,800 on May 21 as ETF hopium heats up. The asset has held on to gains and was trading at $3,750 at the time of writing.
ETH has made a whopping 31% over the past week, most of that coming in a single day.
Bitcoin could not maintain gains, however, dipping below $70,000 during the Wednesday morning Asian trading session.

GALA Price Rises 5% After Hack Recovery and DWF Labs Buy


Following yesterday‚Äôs security breach, Gala Games announced that the stolen funds had been recovered as Ethereum (ETH).
The Gala Games team said they would use Gala Swap to convert the ETH back to their native token, GALA.
DWF Labs Buys 28 Million GALA as Part of Hack Recovery

Jason Brink, President of Blockchain at Gala Games, shared a link to the on-chain data of the stolen fund return transaction. According to the data, the address labeled as Gala Games Exploiter has returned 5,913 ETH, worth approximately $22.37 million with the current price.

The Gala Games team has also shared a detailed explanation of the incident. They said they immediately activated the blocklist protocol after detecting the suspicious transfer of $200 million in GALA tokens.
As a result, they froze all tokens in the unauthorized wallet 45 minutes after the breach. The team claims that such measures allowed them to minimize the impact of the incident.

‚ÄúThis was an isolated incident on the Ethereum network. [‚Ä¶] A new Founder‚Äôs Node ecosystem governance vote will soon decide if the blocklisted GALA will be considered burned as it relates to GALA‚Äôs dynamic supply distribution model as described in the Gala Ecosystem Blueprint,‚Äù they explained.

Gala Games reassured the community that GALA‚Äôs minting capabilities on GalaChain remain secure. They also promised to continuously enhance internal controls and security protocols to protect against such incidents.
Additionally, they plan to reimburse anyone subjected to high transactional fees due to the incident. However, they have not detailed their reimbursement plans further.
As part of recovery efforts, Gala Games received help from crypto market maker DWF Labs‚Äîone of their partners. DWF Labs announced they purchased 28 million GALA tokens on the open market. Assuming 1 GALA is valued at $0.043, DWF Labs‚Äô acquisition is roughly worth $1.2 million.

DWF Labs outlined that this action aimed to stabilize the token‚Äôs value and support Gala Games during these challenging times. This transaction also intends to alleviate market selling pressures and boost investor confidence.

BeInCrypto previously reported that GALA‚Äôs price plunged from $0.047 to $0.038 following the hack. However, DWF Labs‚Äô backing and the Gala Games team‚Äôs mitigation approaches boosted the market. At the time of writing, GALA‚Äôs price has recovered to $0.044, representing an increase of 5.46% in the last 24 hours.

Six Spot Ethereum ETF Applicants Have Filed Amended 19b-4 For Upcoming Approval - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Six spot Ethereum ETF applicants, including Fidelity and ARK Invest, amended filings to exclude staking provisions after SEC feedback.



Experts believe removing staking boosts Ethereum‚Äôs legitimacy and staking returns.




Six proposed spot Ethereum ETF applicants have updated filings in response to comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission in the eleventh hour.





Read more: What Is A Spot Ethereum ETF? How Important Is The New Ether ETF?



Spot Ethereum ETF Applicants Are Actively Preparing for SEC Approval



In total, the spot Ethereum ETF applicants include VanEck, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, ARK Invest, Grayscale, and Invesco Galaxy. Such amendments filed with the Cboe exchange include the changes in response to the SEC‚Äôs concerns and notably remove staking on the Ethereum blockchain for possible ETFs.



Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and ARK 21Shares specifically removed clauses on the validation of Ethereum proof-of-stake from their proposals. In its revised filing, Fidelity emphasized that neither the Trust nor its related parties would stake in the cryptocurrency. Grayscale also made the same statement in its proxy, removing the staking provisions.




Industry Experts Praise Removal of Staking Provisions



Such changes would be made to satisfy SEC requirements. Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, and Ryan Berckmans, an investor in Ethereum, both noted that removing staking could help the overall Ethereum ecosystem by increasing the staking returns and legitimacy of Ethereum without adding risks associated with an ETF.



The Cboe exchange posted these revised 19b-4 filings in a 25-minute window on May 21, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. While the revised filings are a step toward launching, the ETFs still cannot launch until the SEC also approves the corresponding S-1 registration statements. Seyffart noted further that the road to the approval remains long, with revisions still needed for the S-1 forms.



Although the 19b-4 forms might get approved as soon as Thursday, coinciding with VanEck and Cboe‚Äôs deadline, the SEC‚Äôs position on staking has led to strategic changes by the applicants for the spot Ethereum ETF. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the SEC‚Äòs aversion to allowing staking in ETFs is due to political reasons, pointing out a complex regulatory environment for these financial instruments.

Donald Trump Campaign Is Accepting $XRP, $DOGE, and $SHIB Donations | Cryptoglobe


                                
President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign has launched a fundraising page that allows federally permissible donors to contribute using cryptocurrency via the Coinbase Commerce platform. This development is being touted as the first instance of a major party Presidential nominee accepting cryptocurrency donations, expanding the campaign‚Äôs digital fundraising methods.



The campaign has indicated that contributions will comply with Federal Election Commission regulations, including contribution limits and disclosure requirements. Supporters can now make federally permissible cryptocurrency donations at Trump Campaign Crypto Donations.







As you can see from the above screenshot, the cryptocurrencies that are being accepted for donations include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, USD Coin, Solana, and 0x.



According to the campaign‚Äôs blog post, Trump has focused on reducing regulations and promoting innovation in financial technology during his presidency. The campaign contrasts this with the views of Democratic leaders such as Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who are portrayed as favoring increased government control over financial systems.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The campaign suggests that this move reflects a broader effort to enhance individual financial freedom and minimize governmental oversight. They argue that this announcement underscores Trump‚Äôs commitment to an agenda prioritizing personal liberty over what is described as ‚Äúgovernment control.‚Äù



Elizabeth Warren has been vocal about her concerns regarding cryptocurrency, reportedly stating her intent to build an ‚Äúanti-crypto army‚Äù to impose stricter regulations on digital currencies. In contrast, the Trump campaign is calling on its supporters to form a ‚Äúcrypto army‚Äù to bolster the campaign‚Äôs efforts leading up to the election on 5 November 2024.



According to CNBC, this new approach could potentially provide a fresh stream of funds for Trump‚Äôs campaign, which, despite raising more money than Biden‚Äôs in April, still trails in terms of cash reserves. Per the CNBC article, Biden‚Äôs campaign maintains a skeptical stance toward cryptocurrency, reflecting the administration‚Äôs cautious approach. Just hours before Trump‚Äôs campaign began targeting crypto donors, Biden‚Äôs team apparently issued a fundraising message warning that ‚Äúcryptocurrency executives and oil barons are coming out of the woodwork for Trump.‚Äù 



CNBC also points out that while Trump‚Äôs campaign claims he is the ‚Äúfirst major party nominee‚Äù to embrace crypto donations, he is not yet the official nominee. Moreover, he is not the first presidential candidate to accept cryptocurrency; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., running as an independent, announced in May 2023 that his campaign would take bitcoin donations, and Sen. Rand Paul accepted bitcoin during his 2015 presidential bid.

Ripple CEO Spots High Time To Take Action Against Crypto Scams


							

Tech giants including Ripple join forces to combat rising online scams.



Coalition intends to combat the rapidly evolving crypto scams like pig butchering.



Brad Garlinghouse posits it is high time immediate action be taken against such financial scams.




In a significant development, the global payments platform Ripple has joined forces with tech giants like Coinbase, Meta, Kraken, and Gemini to combat the rise of online scams. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse applauded the tech companies‚Äô collaborative effort to disrupt scammers‚Äô activities.







On May 21, these leading technology firms launched ‚ÄúTech Against Scams,‚Äù a coalition dedicated to fighting online fraud and financial thefts. Devraj Varadhan, EVP of Engineering at Ripple, emphasized the importance of educating consumers about these malicious financial schemes, making them more resilient to such threats. He stated:




‚ÄúAs scams continue to become more convincing and intricate, bad actors are taking every opportunity to target and defraud innocent victims. We must fight back and educate individuals on how to protect themselves from these predators. There is no place for scammers, and we must come together across industries to address this pressing issue.‚Äù




Ripple took to X to announce the company‚Äôs decision to join the Tech Against Scams program. The firm wrote on its X page, ‚ÄúTogether, we‚Äôre taking action to protect consumers and disrupt scammers.‚Äù







Welcoming this development, Garlinghouse stated that it is ‚Äúhigh time‚Äù to take strategic action against the growing number of scams and exploits like ‚Äòpig butchering.‚Äô He added:










‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one thing all of us in tech can agree on ‚Äì it‚Äôs high time we dismantled the scammers once and for all. Proud that Ripple is joining this coalition along with other industry heavyweights!‚Äù




Meanwhile, the blockchain platform Coinbase announced its collaboration with the industry leads, emphasizing to its clients the need to follow the best practices to avoid the prevailing crypto threats. Coinbase declared, ‚ÄúThis partnership is dedicated to preventing online fraud and financial schemes that target consumers across various industries.‚Äù¬†

Hong Kong Privacy Commission Targets Worldcoin: Key Findings


The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD), Hong Kong, has reportedly completed its investigation into Worldcoin. 
The investigation found significant violations of the Personal data (privacy) regulations. 
Hong Kong Has Been Probing Worldcoin Since December 2023

According to Hong Kong-based media outlet RTHK, Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung Lai-ling issued an enforcement notice against Worldcoin. The notice demands the immediate cessation of iris and facial image collection using scanning devices.
The investigation revealed that Worldcoin‚Äôs practices in Hong Kong were excessive and unnecessary. Specifically, the retention of personal data for up to ten years to train AI models for identity verification was deemed excessive. Additionally, the collection, retention, transparency, access, and correction of personal data were all found to be in breach of the ordinance.
Worldcoin reportedly failed to adequately inform participants about the purpose of data collection and their rights to access and correct personal data was a key issue. Moreover, the project faced criticism for its lack of Chinese versions of privacy statements and consent forms.

The PCPD noted that staff did not explain or confirm participants‚Äô understanding of these documents. Furthermore, they did not inform them of the risks associated with disclosing biometric data.
From December 2023 to January 2024, the PCPD conducted ten undercover operations at six Worldcoin locations in Hong Kong. Following a court-authorized entry into operation sites, the investigation concluded that 8,302 people had undergone facial and iris scanning for identity verification. These participants submitted to iris scanning to verify their human identity, creating an iris code for registered identity verification.

‚ÄúWith the view to protecting the personal data privacy of members of the public, although we have not received any complaints about the project, the office has proactively commenced an investigation against Worldcoin in accordance with established procedures,‚Äù Lo Dik-fan, a senior personal data officer, said.

Despite these developments, there has been no significant impact on Worldcoin‚Äôs (WLD) price. As of writing, WLD is trading at 5.07, down by 1.59% in the past 24 hours.

The PCPD‚Äôs findings are part of broader regulatory challenges Worldcoin faces globally. For example, in Buenos Aires, authorities highlighted discrepancies between Worldcoin‚Äôs data handling practices and local regulations. 

Further scrutiny revealed that Worldcoin might have collected data from minors and stored biometric data from Argentine users in Brazil. This situation raises questions about privacy and data sovereignty. If proven, Worldcoin could face a fine of up to 1 billion Argentine pesos ($1.2 million).
In March, Portugal‚Äôs data protection authority ‚Äì CNPD temporarily halted Worldcoin‚Äôs data collection, citing risks to citizen data protection. This suspension, affecting over 300,000 Portuguese citizens, followed numerous complaints about unauthorized data collection, particularly from minors.

Other countries, including Spain, have also restricted Worldcoin‚Äôs operations due to similar concerns about the safety and ethical implications of biometric data collection.

Polkadot Price Prediction: Is DOT About to Soar Above $10?


																TL;DR

Polkadot (DOT) saw a 7% daily price increase, exceeding the $7.50 mark, with analysts predicting further gains, potentially reaching $10 and beyond.
Analysts such as Michael van de Poppe and Block Diversity envision DOT‚Äôs next targets in the $9-$25 range, boosted by the recent introduction of the JAM whitepaper and surpassing important resistance levels.


DOT‚Äôs Next Possible Move
The cryptocurrency market is flashing green today (May 21), with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and many more leading digital assets charting impressive ascents. Polkadot (DOT) is also among the notable gainers, registering a 7% daily price increase.
DOT Price, Source: CoinGecko
Numerous analysts noted the asset‚Äôs rally, outlining impressive predictions for the near future. One example is the X user Crypto Thanos, who¬†claimed¬†that the $6-$7.50 range was ‚Äúfor accumulating only,‚Äù setting $10 as the next target.
Dippy.eth¬†chipped in, too,¬†suggesting¬†that DOT ‚Äúwants to break out‚Äù from the accumulation zone of $6.90-$7.50. In their view, reclaiming the $7.50 mark might lead to ‚Äúhigher levels.‚Äù Recall that the asset surpassed that mark a few hours ago and is currently trading at approximately $7.55 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data).




Crypto Tony touched upon the matter yesterday (May 20) when DOT‚Äôs price was hovering around $6.90. The analyst¬†said they are looking for ‚Äúa safe entry‚Äù once the asset exceeds the $7.40 resistance mark. It will be interesting to follow whether the trader will jump into DOT‚Äôs ecosystem as promised.¬†
Previous Forecasts
Another crypto analyst who envisioned¬†a bright future for Polkadot‚Äôs native cryptocurrency is Michael van de Poppe. The X user, with over 700,000 followers, recently¬†claimed¬†that DOT has already ‚Äúbottomed,‚Äù especially since the introduction of the JAM whitepaper. According to Michael van de Poppe, DOT‚Äôs next price target could be in the $20-$25 range.
Recall that the team behind¬†Polkadot¬†released¬†the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) Gray Paper last month.¬†The upgrade‚Äôs goal is to create a more¬†efficient, secure, and scalable blockchain environment that integrates the best aspects of¬†both¬†Polkadot and Ethereum technologies.
For their part, Block Diversity¬†predicted¬†a price rally toward $9, $11, and eventually $13 based on DOT clearing the¬†major¬†resistance level of $6.90.

Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GAYELON has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gay Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin.



Gay Elon Musk launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gay Elon Musk on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Elon Musk by entering its contract address ‚Äì AErKQkbiSgsRMT1GmS7XW5tWkpSmdT1zdVJCMv1unvBH ‚Äì in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYELON.

Is Ethereum 'underpriced' against Bitcoin? Here's what analysts say - AMBCrypto



Analyst claims that an ‚Äòapproved‚Äô ETH ETF could attract inflows from US spot BTC ETFs.
Another analyst claims that ETH ETFs might not see outflows like in the GBTC case.¬†

According to crypto analyst and founder of Lekker Capital, Quinn Thompson, Ethereum [ETH] was grossly undervalued against Bitcoin [BTC]. 
Citing the recent update on potential ETH ETF approval and expected capital inflows, Thompson claimed,
‚ÄòThis leads me to believe that ETHBTC at 0.05 is still underpriced, particularly given we are in a bull market‚Äô¬†
The ETHBTC ratio tracks ETH‚Äôs performance in BTC terms. An increasing value suggests that ETH is outperforming BTC. However, a drop in the ratio implies that BTC is eclipsing ETH on the price charts.¬†
The ETHBTC ratio dropped to a low of 0.45 on the 16th of May. However, it has since recovered to above 0.50 following a recent update on ETH ETF approval.¬†
ETF to boost ETH price?
Thompson claimed that ETH hasn‚Äôt been able to attract enough flows because of a lack of ETFs, and the market was obsessed with BTC and Solana [SOL].¬†
‚ÄòThe reason ETH was the ugly middle child between BTC and SOL for the past 6 months was the lack of inflows from an ETF‚Äô
However, market watchers have mixed views on whether ETH ETFs will follow the BTC ETF‚Äôs path. 
After being converted to an ETF in January, GBTC recorded about $17 billion in cumulative outflows as of the 21st of May.¬†¬†
Will Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum Trust (ETHE) face a similar fate and dent ETH‚Äôs upside potential?¬†
Crypto analyst James Van Straten was conflicted about the possible outcome. 
Instead, Straten mentioned that the proposed Grayscale Mini Trust (ETH) could alleviate issues like fees that led to massive outflows in GBTC.¬†¬†
‚ÄòThe mini trust $ETH may launch at the same time with smaller fees, and investors don‚Äôt need to do anything, which wasn‚Äôt available for $GBTC.‚Äô
The proposed Mini Trust will be a spin-off from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).¬†
Interestingly, Thompson projected that ETH could attract about 9% of inflows from spot BTC ETFs in the first four months after ‚Äòapproval.‚Äô 
If confirmed, the ETHBTC ratio could increase from the current 0.53, fueling the ETH value.¬†
A Standard Chartered executive held the same bullish stance on ETH post-ETF. 
In an interview with The Block, Standard Chartered‚Äôs head of Digital Assets Research, Geoff Kendrick, claimed that ETH ETF could be approved this week.¬†
Kendrick maintained that ETH could hit $8000 by year-end. He added that ETH ETFs could attract ‚Äòroughly $15 billion to $45 billion‚Äô in inflows in the first 12 months.¬†
That said, whether ETH eclipses BTC post-ETF launch remains to be seen. In the meantime, the market will focus on the SEC‚Äôs decision on the 23rd of May on VanEck‚Äôs ETH ETF application.¬†

Ethereum Co-Founder Joe Lubin Talks About Ethereum ETFs: "Be Prepared for These Results If Approved!" - Bitcoin Sistemi

After months of anticipation, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears ready to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), setting the stage for a significant increase in demand for Ethereum (ETH) that could lead to a supply shortage.
Ethereum Co-Founder Predicts Supply Squeeze With Potential Approval of Ethereum ETFs
Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of Consensys, made a statement about ETFs in an interview.


Lubin explained that institutions investing in Bitcoin through recently launched ETFs are likely to diversify their holdings with Ethereum once spot Ethereum ETFs receive approval.
‚ÄúThere will be a fair amount of natural, pent-up pressure to buy Ethereum through ETFs,‚Äù he said. However, this demand may face a more limited supply compared to the Bitcoin ETFs approved earlier this year.





In January, when spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, authorized participants ‚Äî the firms responsible for purchasing Bitcoin on behalf of the ETFs ‚Äî were able to easily purchase idle coins available on exchanges or through over-the-counter transactions.
However, the situation with Ethereum is different. On-chain data shows that more than 27% of the total Ethereum supply is currently staked on the Ethereum network, generating returns for holders and therefore kept out of direct circulation.



‚ÄúThe bulk of Ethereum is used in the core protocol, DeFi systems, or DAOs,‚Äù Lubin said, referring to decentralized autonomous organizations.
This locked supply, combined with Ethereum's market dynamics, could make Ethereum's price more sensitive to expected inflows from ETFs.





Moreover, increased activity on the Ethereum network will trigger the burning of some of the existing Ethereum supply over time, further tightening the current supply. The deflation mechanism introduced by Ethereum's EIP-1559 upgrade contributes to scarcity by systematically reducing the supply of Ethereum in circulation.
The scenario for Ethereum ETFs could parallel or even exceed the supply pressures faced by Bitcoin ETFs.
Lubin emphasized the broader significance of this development, calling it a ‚Äúprofound turning point‚Äù for Ethereum and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.

Ethereum Blockchain's Ether (ETH) Token Nearly Adds an Entire Solana (SOL) to Its Market Value

"Near-term ETH outlook is incredibly bullish. Let's not overcomplicate it," Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an email. "The ETF announcement is a near black swan even to (most) investors, markets dramatically short-to-underweight ETH, much of ETH liquidity is locked in staking, and the macro backdrop is favourable,"

How Launchpads Are Fueling a Start-up Investment Boom

Editorial Note: The following content does not reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions. 
Crypto start-up investing is heating up. The first quarter of 2024 saw a total of $2.52 billion invested in crypto and blockchain projects, according to PitchBook ‚Äì some 25% higher than Q4 2023. 
And all signs point to an exponential increase throughout the second half of the year. Nearly every day, we‚Äôre seeing projects in the DePIN, AI, and GameFi sectors closing bigger and bigger funding rounds, and much of this surge in activity is being fuelled by crypto launchpads.
In crypto, a launchpad is a platform that facilitates the introduction and sale of a new token to the public, typically through a process called an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Launchpads act as an intermediary between crypto projects and investors. They offer a more structured and secure environment for investors and a wide range of start-up services ‚Äì from regulatory compliance to marketing support.¬†

For example, Yield App Angel provides access to its established community of 105,000 users with an estimated $20 billion in total crypto assets, along with marketing support, strong KOL relationships, access to top VCs, and so much more. Investors, meanwhile, can choose from a curated selection of vetted projects.¬†
The Formula to Start-Up Success
There are many examples of projects that successfully raised capital via a launchpad. One name any crypto enthusiast will recognize is Polygon ‚Äì a platform aiming to create a multi-chain blockchain ecosystem compatible with Ethereum. Polygon, originally called Matic Network, raised funds with the help of the Binance Launchpad back in 2019. According to Defi Llama it grew into a thriving ecosystem, with around $8 billion in total value locked (TVL) at the height of the 2021 DeFi boom.
Today, there is a wide range of launchpads in the Web3 space, from platforms run by leading centralized exchanges like Binance and Bitget, to dedicated incubators and launchpads like Yield App Angel or Seedify. Every day, these launchpads are helping start-ups get off the ground with successful funding rounds. Seedify, for example, says it has helped more than 50 projects raise some $18 million in total funding and grow their market caps to five times the total amount raised.However, while launchpads can offer a crucial support network for crypto start-ups conducting a funding round, the 2018 ICO boom has also left them with a bad rep. Some were responsible for promoting pump-and-dump tokens, with an estimated 80% of all ICOs in 2017 identified as scams.¬†
The Importance of Due Diligence
So, while launchpads are a crucial piece of the puzzle for start-up funding, as an investor, it‚Äôs important to find one that follows strict due diligence rules to avoid fraudulent projects, since not all launchpads are made equal. If you want to make the most of the current start-up investment boom but security is your top concern, then Yield App Angel could be for you.¬†
With the help of its proprietary 135-point risk assessment model, Yield App expertly navigated the 2022 crypto downturn, having avoided the collapsed UST stablecoin. In fact, Yield App has seen zero hacks or exploits since its inception. You can be confident all projects available through its launchpad will adhere to the same high standards as the rest of Yield App‚Äôs portfolio.¬†

In the 2024 start-up investment boom, robust due diligence will be particularly crucial. With thousands of new crypto projects coming to market, it‚Äôs increasingly difficult for investors to identify the ones that will deliver the best value. Launchpads with a focus on security and risk controls will create a bridge between investors and the highest quality early-stage projects coming to market.
Yield App Angel: The Gold Standard in Fundraising
Ensuring that its users have access to the most promising ICO opportunities is at the heart of Yield App Angel. Typically, these early-stage allocations are only available to top VCs and the most privileged funds, but Yield App provides early access to retail investors with much lower minimum investments. On top of this, Yield App‚Äôs total allocations are typically much larger than other launchpads ($300,000-$4 million) and can be oversubscribed, which guarantees access to all those interested.
Recently, Yield App Angel facilitated a successful fundraising round for ME3 ‚Äì a project revolutionizing fan engagement and community interaction by bringing together eSports, gaming, finance, and social connections and is currently taking subscriptions for AI project Raiinmaker.
With a wide selection of exciting fundraising rounds in the pipeline, Yield App Angel will play a pivotal role in giving the average investor access to the 2024 start-up investment boom. From gaming to AI and everything in between, Yield App seeks out curated early-stage projects that offer a real opportunity to grow your wealth and make the most of the bull market in a secure, risk-controlled way.

Analysts Expect Spot Ethereum ETFs to Launch in Weeks


Analysts anticipate the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs within weeks, following significant amendments to filings by issuers like Fidelity and Ark 21Shares.
Though US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval remains uncertain, these developments could mark a pivotal moment for the crypto market.
SEC Filings Amended, Paving Way for Potential Ethereum ETF Launch

The SEC recently requested amendments to the 19b-4 forms filed by asset managers for spot Ethereum ETFs. Five potential issuers‚ÄîFidelity, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton‚Äîhave complied and made the necessary changes through Cboe. They removed language related to staking and added clear statements that the funds cannot be staked by anyone.

‚ÄúNeither the Trust or the Fund, nor the Sponsor, nor the Custodian, nor any other person associated with the Trust or Fund will, directly or indirectly, engage in action where any portion of the Fund‚Äôs ETH becomes subject to the Ethereum proof-of-stake validation or is used to earn additional ETH or generate income or other earnings,‚Äù the amended documents read.

The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation‚Äôs (DTCC) website has also featured VanEck‚Äôs proposed spot Ethereum ETF with ticker ETHV. Despite these positive developments, SEC approval is not guaranteed.

VIDEO


‚ÄúNeed to actually see SEC approval orders on all the 19b-4s and then we need to see S-1 approvals,‚Äù James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said.

The 19b-4 filings propose rule changes necessary for listing new products on stock exchanges, such as spot Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, S-1 registration forms provide detailed information about new securities offered to the public, including the fund‚Äôs structure, management, and investment strategy. Issuers must obtain approval for both forms to launch ETFs in the market officially.
Nonetheless, Seyffart expressed optimism after seeing this progress. He stated it ‚Äúcould be weeks or more before [Ethereum] ETFs launch.‚Äù Despite his optimism, Seyffart affirmed that his approval odds are still the same, at 75%.
Many see the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs as a bullish signal for the broader crypto market. However, approving these ETFs without allowing staking might disadvantage investors seeking additional yield from staking rewards.
Investors who buy, hold, and stake ETH can earn staking rewards, which provide extra yield. In contrast, spot Ethereum ETFs without staking provide exposure to ETH prices but lack the benefits of staking rewards.

According to a recent report, the same reason led asset managers CoinShares and Valkyrie to decide not to apply for spot Ethereum ETFs. A source familiar with the matter said that the firms don‚Äôt see value for investors without the staking aspect.
Industry experts believe that political considerations could influence the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. This is especially relevant to the upcoming US presidential election in November. BeInCrypto reported that several experts agree the approval might signal a shift in President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration‚Äôs stance on crypto.

Recently, Emilie Choi, President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) at Coinbase, also noticed the swift change in SEC‚Äôs stance.

‚ÄúAnd the sense is that the tone from the SEC has just changed literally overnight based on some feedback, it must have gotten from just seeing the [Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121] SAB 121 repeal and probably the administration seeing sensing some panic, I guess,‚Äù Choi said during the JPMorgan Technology, Media & Communications Conference 2024.

VanEck's Fund Listed on DTCC, Approval Anticipated


							

VanEck‚Äôs Ethereum ETF takes a step forward, but full launch awaits SEC approval.



BlackRock, Fidelity, and others also in the race for a spot Ethereum ETF.



SEC‚Äôs recent move sparks optimism for potential approval of Ethereum ETFs.




Investment management giant VanEck saw its spot Ethereum ETF make its way onto the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation‚Äôs (DTCC) list of ETFs.



The DTCC, an American financial market infrastructure company renowned for providing post-trade clearance, settlement, custody, and information services, confirmed the addition on its website.



Crucially, listing the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF is a preliminary step and does not indicate the full launch of the fund. The ETF is still awaiting regulatory approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other similar filings from industry heavyweights like BlackRock, Fidelity, etc.



Furthermore, under the create/redeem column, the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF is marked as ‚ÄúN,‚Äù suggesting that it is not yet active. The DTCC noted:




‚ÄúThis file includes both active ETFs that may be processed at DTCC and ETFs that are not yet active (‚Äúpre-launch‚Äù) and, therefore, are not able to be processed at DTCC, unless and until such securities have received all necessary regulatory and other approvals.‚Äù




The SEC-registered securities clearing corporation has listed VanEck‚Äôs spot Ethereum fund ticker as ‚ÄúETHV.‚Äù¬†









Earlier this week, reports emerged that the SEC requested US firms to update and refile their 19B-4 filings concerning their proposed spot Ethereum ETFs. This move has been interpreted by some as a positive signal, potentially indicating forthcoming approval from the regulator.¬†The 19B-4 forms are essential documents that notify the SEC about a proposed rule change and require the agency‚Äôs approval before spot Ethereum ETFs can become effective. According to analysts, the regulator might approve 19B-4s but take its time greenlighting the S-1 filings.

Bitget celebrates il Bitcoin pizza day con oltre 20 Eventi Globali

To celebrate Bitcoin pizza day, Bitget, one of the main cryptocurrency exchanges, organized over 20 offline events worldwide. These meetings, held from May 19 to 22, brought together cryptocurrency enthusiasts on five continents to commemorate a crucial moment in the history of Bitcoin.

The origin of Bitcoin pizza day
Bitcoin Pizza Day, celebrated annually on May 22, marks the date of the first transaction with BTC made for a purchase in the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world.¬†
In 2010, in fact, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer from Florida, bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC, which today would have a value of about 270 million dollars!¬†
This transaction has demonstrated the potential of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, transforming it from an innovative idea to a revolutionary financial asset.

The global celebrations of Bitget for Bitcoin pizza day
‚Äú`
Le celebrazioni di Bitget, per commemorare questa data storica, sono state ampie ed hanno coperto citt√† importanti come Brisbane, Buenos Aires, San Paolo e Taipei. 
A Taipei, l‚Äôevento ha visto la partecipazione di Steve Chen, co-fondatore di YouTube.¬†
In Australia, the evento √® stato organizzato in collaborazione con l‚ÄôAustralian DeFi Association e la comunit√† All Things Blockchain. Le attivit√† includevano sessioni di networking, condivisione di pizze, discussioni sulla blockchain e approfondimenti da parte di Bitget.
A San Paolo, Bitget ha invece collaborato con Domino‚Äôs Pizza per fornire pizze no stop all‚Äôevento, mentre a Buenos Aires √® stato organizzato un evento di trading.¬†
These occasions therefore never turn out to be just simple celebrations, but also platforms to discuss the current landscape of blockchain technology and trading opportunities.
Beyond the celebrations: rewards and innovations
To make the celebrations more engaging, Bitget has offered exciting rewards. The company has created a 3D video to spread the message and has announced an APR of 100% in USDT for new users on Bitget Earn until June 16.¬†
These initiatives underline Bitget‚Äôs commitment to enhancing user engagement and promoting the adoption of criptovalute.

Reflections on the journey of Bitcoin
‚Äú`
Il Bitcoin Pizza Day non √® solo una semplice celebrazione, il Pizza Day √® un grande e forte reminder per tutta la comunit√† crypto.
The pizza Day is one of those dates that force us to stop and reflect on the enormous opportunity that cryptocurrencies still offer us today.
It forces us to take an important zoom out of the situation, becoming aware of the fact that investments in crypto remain the most profitable and advantageous investments of the last decade.¬†
Despite their volatility, despite the regulatory uncertainty in some of their aspects, there are absolutely no rivals.¬†
Despite the skepticism and sporadic bugs of the system, crypto, to date, has no competitor in terms of economic return.¬†¬†
With the Pizza day, therefore, the early adopters are honored and continuous innovation in the sector is encouraged.

SEC: Uniswap ritiene insensata la regolamentazione della DeFi

According to Uniswap Labs, the attempt by the SEC to impose DeFi regulation would be weak and wrong.¬†
This is what they wrote yesterday in a post published on their official blog titled ‚ÄúThe fight for DeFi continues‚Äù.

DeFi Regulation: The issue between Uniswap and the SEC
Everything originates from the Wells notice that the SEC sent to Uniswap in April.
Questo avviso informava Uniswap Labs che l‚Äôagenzia intendeva intraprendere un‚Äôazione legale contro di loro.¬†
According to Uniswap, the SEC claims that the Uniswap protocol is an unregistered exchange controlled by the company Uniswap Labs.¬†
In reality, the Uniswap protocol is decentralized, and in theory, it should not be controlled by anyone, except by the Ethereum network as a whole, and by the other networks on which it runs.¬†
However, the SEC also argues that Uniswap Labs acts as an unregistered financial intermediary, and that the token UNI is an investment contract.
Uniswap‚Äôs objections to these accusations are that the value represented in a specific digital file format cannot always and in every case be defined as a security, and that the SEC cannot arbitrarily extend the definitions of exchange, broker, and contracts to the point of rendering them meaningless.¬†
I token vengono paragonati da Uniswap a formati di file, mentre il protocollo viene definito come un programma informatico di uso generale che chiunque pu√≤ utilizzare e integrare.¬†
Furthermore, it emphasizes that the hundreds of thousands of users who received UNI tokens for their participation, in the early days, received the token for free, without any contract and without any specific expectation of profit.¬†
The response of Uniswap Labs to the SEC‚Äôs note on DeFi regulation
Uniswap Labs has already sent the SEC a comprehensive legal response to their Wells notice, and in yesterday‚Äôs post, it summarized its position for easier understanding.
First of all, they state that they believe the SEC should embrace open source technology, instead of stopping it. In this regard, they also mock the agency, highlighting how its goal should be to ‚Äúprotect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.‚Äù¬†
Instead, their aggressive theories are defined as an effort to expand the jurisdiction of the SEC beyond the exchanges, to communication technology and all markets.¬†
A tal proposito sottolineano come le loro argomentazioni legali siano talmente deboli da essere gi√† addirittura state confutate dai tribunali. Sottolineano anche che la Camera statunitense potrebbe approvare un disegno di legge che conferirebbe alla CFTC, e non alla SEC, l‚Äôautorit√† per vigilare sul trading di asset digitali.
They believe they are on the right side of history, and they invite the SEC not to dedicate its taxpayer-funded resources to initiate a lawsuit against them.
In the event that the case goes to court, they claim to be ready to fight, having on their side lawyers like Andrew Ceresney, former head of SEC enforcement who has already represented Ripple in the victory against the agency, and Don Verrilli, former United States Solicitor General who represented Grayscale in its bull case won against the agency.
The Uniswap protocol¬†
Regarding the Uniswap protocol developed by them, they believe it represents an important innovation in the markets, and that it benefits the consumers directly.¬†
It is an autonomous software that allows users to carry out transactions directly with each other, without intermediaries, without having to pay fees or rely on centralized intermediaries.¬†
Moreover, this protocol can actually be integrated by anyone with an Internet connection, even without relying on anyone else, not even Uniswap Labs.¬†
They write:¬†
‚ÄúIt just works. It has supported a trading volume of 2 trillion dollars without a single hack and has been integrated by thousands of teams and copied thousands of times‚Äù.
They also emphasize that many traditional markets are actually neither efficient nor transparent, in addition to the fact that they operate on limited days and hours, sometimes with delays of several days, requiring various intermediaries who charge commissions that increase costs for all users.¬†
Uniswap invece ha transazioni trasparenti che possono essere verificate da chiunque, la liquidazione √® immediata, ed il servizio √® disponibile in tutto il mondo 24 ore su 24, 7 giorni su 7.¬†
They add:
‚ÄúThese properties offer individuals an unprecedented authority to control what they own and create value on the Internet in new ways‚Äù.
SEC defeated?
In recent years the SEC has been defeated twice in court by crypto companies.¬†
First from Ripple, which managed to convince a judge that XRP should not be considered as an unregistered security when traded on the secondary market (the exchanges).¬†
Following Grayscale, which managed to convince a judge that the SEC‚Äôs opposition to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs was wrong, after the same agency had instead approved futures ETFs on Bitcoin.¬†
Apparently, this week the SEC might be defeated for the third time by the crypto sector, as it seems to be intending to approve the spot Ethereum ETFs, despite claiming that ETH should be considered an unregistered security.
It has always been quite clear that the SEC‚Äôs fight against the crypto sector was also a purely political initiative by a part of the United States Democratic Party, around which the current head of the agency Gary Gensler orbits, and given that in November they seriously risk losing the elections, they might have decided on a change of course to avoid losing the crypto electorate.¬†
The vittima sacrificale at this point should be the same Gary Gensler, on whom the democrats might end up placing the entire responsibility for this failure to try to come out clean in this election year.¬†

Uniswap Slams SEC's Wells Notice, Calls Out ‚ÄòWeak‚Äô Arguments


                        
                            Uniswap Fires Back at SEC‚Äôs Wells Notice, Calls Out ‚ÄòWeak‚Äô Legal Arguments

                        Uniswap Labs filed a 40-page response on Tuesday to the SEC‚Äôs Wells Notice, arguing against a potential lawsuit and urging the agency to drop the matter.It comes after the agency raised concerns a few weeks ago that Uniswap‚Äôs operations might violate US securities laws. The decentralized crypto exchange is now explaining in detail why the SEC could be wrong.Uniswap serves as a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform catering to developers, traders, and liquidity providers. But the SEC claimed that Uniswap Protocol operates as an unregistered securities exchange under Uniswap Labs‚Äô control, while labeling the Uniswap interface as an unregistered securities broker-dealer, and the UNI token as an investment contract.SEC Should Not Waste Taxpayer Money on This Case: Uniswap
Uniswap hit back, stating that the SEC‚Äôs legal assertions are ‚Äúweak‚Äù and have been contradicted by court rulings.The crypto marketplace argued that the agency is stretching the definitions of securities, exchanges, and contracts to an unreasonable point. It also said the SEC‚Äôs accusations hinge on the idea that any value stored in a digital format can be considered a security.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre confident that our work is on the right side of history,‚Äù Uniswap said. ‚ÄúThe SEC should not devote its taxpayer-funded resources to bringing a case against us.‚ÄùMost Users Outside SEC‚Äôs Jurisdiction, Uniswap Claims
Uniswap argued that most trading on its platform doesn‚Äôt involve securities, even by the SEC‚Äôs own standards. It pointed out that a large portion (65%) of its trading volume involves assets the SEC itself has admitted aren‚Äôt securities, like Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, and stablecoins.Additionally, the protocol argued that US securities laws wouldn‚Äôt apply to most users since it estimate 75% of them are from outside the US.The marketplace said that even if a few security-like transactions took place on its platform, it isn‚Äôt a securities exchange. It said a court wouldn‚Äôt see it that way because the platform wasn‚Äôt built specifically for those transactions.The federal regulator has aggressively sent Wells notices, filed lawsuits, and settled with numerous crypto companies. Its focus is shifting towards Ethereum and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) players, with ShapeShift, TradeStation, Uniswap, Consensys all facing legal action. The Ethereum Foundation is also reportedly under investigation.

                        BlackRock‚Äôs spot Bitcoin¬†exchange-traded fund (ETF) has generated significant traction, accounting for 95% of the total inflow into United States spot Bitcoin ETFs on Tuesday.The combined inflows for these ETFs surpassed $300 million, a substantial boost for the market.Preliminary data from Farside Investors¬†reveals that BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) witnessed a substantial inflow of $290 million on May 21.¬†When considering all eleven ETF issuers combined, the net inflow amounted to $305.7 million.Notably, this marks a reversal in the trend of zero or minimal inflows observed over the past six weeks.BlackRock‚Äôs ETF Sees Uptick in Inflows
The recent influx of funds into BlackRock‚Äôs ETF represents the highest level since April 5, eclipsing the cumulative inflows witnessed over the past 21 trading days.In the context of a volatile Bitcoin rally, spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced over $1 billion in inflows during the past four trading days.Taking into account the latest daily figures, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT has accumulated a total of $16 billion in inflows since its launch, as reported by Farside Investors.However, the official website for the product displays assets under management (AUM) of $19 billion.This positions BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT in close proximity to industry leader Grayscale, whose GBTC spot ETF boasts $20 billion in AUM, according to official records.Conversely, Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC recorded zero inflows on May 21, extending the streak of five consecutive trading days without outflows.Within the past five days, the fund has witnessed inflows of $72.5 billion, marking a reversal from a four-month trend characterized by consistent outflows.VanEck‚Äôs ETF Sees Outflows
Meanwhile, the significant inflow figure on Tuesday was not without its share of outflows.The VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF (HODL) experienced an outflow of $5.9 million, while the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) saw an outflow of $4.2 million.The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) observed a minor inflow of $25.8 million, while the remaining ETFs reported no significant changes.The enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin ETFs has been fueled by a recent uptick in BTC prices, with the asset gaining 12% over the past week.On May 21, BTC reached a six-week high of $71,600, but it subsequently dipped below the $70,000 level during early trading on May 22, currently trading at $69,444 at the time of writing.As reported, Bitcoin has achieved all-time highs¬†against local currencies in several countries across Asia and South America.Markus Thielen, the head of research at 10x Research, previously predicted that a breakthrough above $67,500¬†could potentially lead to new all-time highs.¬†Currently, BTC is trading at $69,000, just $3,000 away from reaching a new all-time high in U.S. dollars.Aside from 10x Research, some other analysts have also turned bullish on Bitcoin following weeks-long consolidation.Leading trading firm QCP Capital has expressed optimism about Bitcoin‚Äôs price momentum, forecasting a potential return to the highs of $74,000.In a¬†recent note, the firm said it has observed substantial buyers acquiring 100,000 to 120,000 BTC Calls for December 2024, indicating confidence in the upward movement of the cryptocurrency.

Biden campaign in panic mode as Trump accepts crypto donations


    Not long after declaring his support for the cryptocurrency sector and making it one of the defining points of his presidential bid, the former United States President Donald Trump is now officially accepting donations for his campaign in the form of crypto assets, creating concerns for his opponent‚Äôs team.



Specifically, in a historic decision, the Trump campaign has announced it would start accepting donations in digital assets and has launched a fundraising page allowing them, making the former President the first major party nominee in the US to do this, according to a press release on May 21.

As per the press release, the fundraising page provides ‚Äúany federally permissible donor the ability to give ‚Äì through its joint fundraising committees ‚Äì using any cryptocurrency accepted through the Coinbase Commerce product,‚Äù referring to the popular crypto exchange.







Indeed, the presidential hopeful‚Äôs campaign is now accepting a range of popular assets from the crypto sector, including the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset Bitcoin (BTC), as well as altcoins Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and stablecoin USD Coin (USDC).¬†



Trump vs. Biden crypto issue



Furthermore, the announcement reads that this makes Trump different from his rival, the incumbent US President Joe Biden, ‚Äúand his official surrogate Elizabeth Warren,‚Äù the Democrat Senator from Massachusetts, as the former president ‚Äúhas reduced regulations and championed innovation in financial technology.‚Äù




‚ÄúThe effort to reduce the control of government on an American‚Äôs financial decision-making is part of a seismic shift toward freedom. Today‚Äôs announcement reflects President Trump‚Äôs commitment to an agenda that values freedom over socialistic government control.‚Äù




On the other hand, Trump‚Äôs campaign argues that his opponents ‚Äúbelieve only government has the answers to how our nation leads the world,‚Äù also addressing Warren‚Äôs March 2023 reelection ad, accusing her of ‚Äúbuilding an ‚Äòanti-crypto army‚Äô to restrict Americans‚Äô right to make their own financial choices.‚Äù



Biden campaign in panic mode



Meanwhile, Biden‚Äôs team has sent a fundraising text warning donors that ‚Äúcryptocurrency executives and oil barons are coming out of the woodwork for Trump,‚Äù around the same time as the Trump campaign made the above announcement, according to a widely circulated screenshot.

As a reminder, Trump recently said he was ‚Äúfine with crypto,‚Äù that he was planning to reduce regulatory ‚Äúhostility‚Äù towards it and keep crypto businesses in America, as well as making it possible for his supporters to donate to his campaign using crypto assets, as Finbold reported on May 9.

PEPE Price Hits New ATH: Could Massive Corrections Follow?


PEPE‚Äôs price continued to please its holders, as the meme coin not only led the rallying altcoins but also marked a new all-time high in the last 24 hours.
However, this could trigger the altcoin observing a decline as investors look primed to sell.
PEPE Investors Close to Selling

Following the PEPE price rise, the meme coin looks prepared to see some major selling as the altcoin investors realize massive profits. According to the Network Realized Profit/Loss indicator, the overall gains have been inclining for the past month.
Realized profits are a sign that the investors are selling, and this could now intensify as the meme coin hits a new ATH.¬†This¬†seems to have¬†saturated the bullishness and may lead to heavy selling.

Secondly, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio also hints at profit-taking. The MVRV ratio monitors investor profits and losses. With PEPE‚Äôs 30-day MVRV at 38%, indicating profit, selling may ensue.¬†

Historically, the meme coin has undergone corrections at MVRV levels of 15% to 36%, marking it as a danger zone. PEPE is already above this level, which signifies stronger profit-taking potential.

Should this happen, the altcoin could note a fall below key support.
PEPE Price Prediction: Awaiting a Dip
PEPE price market the new ATH of $0.00001430 after rising by 51% in the last two days. At the time of writing, the altcoin is not exhibiting any signs of a decline, but considering the above indicators, it could occur soon.

The most likely outcome would be a fall to $0.00001251, which marks the 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement. Intense selling could extend this decline¬†and¬†PEPE could dip to the 61.8% Fib line at $0.00001146.
This line is known to be a bull market support floor, so losing it would wipe away a chunk of the recent profits.

But if PEPE bounces off this support floor, the meme coin could have a shot at reinitiating recovery. The same happened in mid-May before the altcoin jumped, which could invalidate the bearish thesis.

According to Gensler, FIT21 ignores long-standing precedent for how investment contracts are regulated, puts the agency into a tough position for certifying self-proclaimed digital commodity issuers, ignores Supreme Court precedent in the Howey Test, removes investor protections and potentially allows investors to take on excessive risk without appropriate disclosures.

Milady Maker led CryptoSlam‚Äôs daily non-fungible token (NFT) sales chart on Tuesday with US$1.07 million, up from Monday‚Äôs US$267,554.



Milady‚Äôs Tuesday surge follows backlash against Yuga Labs, the owner of the CryptoPunks IP. The company faced criticism for announcing on Monday a new NFT collection focusing on race and gender, tied to CryptoPunks, the day‚Äôs second-ranking collection.



While disappointed CryptoPunks owners warned they might sell their NFTs, members of the Milady community predicted that the funds would flow into Milady.







CryptoSlam data shows that many CryptoPunk owners moved their assets. It ranked second on the day with US$737,526 in sales, although it only recorded five sales transactions on Tuesday. Additionally, it also recorded 14 transfers.

	
	
	
	


On Monday, the collection had 30 total transfers, which is the highest since late March.



Following closely in third place, DMarket recorded a daily sales volume of US$735,546, with 3,680 unique buyers and sellers at 3,230, contributing to 28,835 total transactions.



Other notable collections include Fantasy Top and The Captainz, ranking fourth and fifth respectively. 



Fantasy Top achieved a daily sales volume of US$652,892 with 1,726 unique buyers, while The Captainz garnered US$618,594 with 33 unique buyers.

	
	
	

	


The Ethereum blockchain, where Milady, CryptoPunks and Captainz reside, led all blockchains with US$8.47 million in NFT sales, rising from the previous day‚Äôs US$6.09 million, a 39% jump.



In contrast, the Bitcoin blockchain reported a daily sales volume of US$5.85 million with 1,798 unique buyers, an increase from the previous day‚Äôs US$4.97 million. 



Polygon and Mythos Chain also reported substantial daily sales of US$1.60 million and US$758,947.38, respectively, highlighting the diverse and active nature of the NFT market across various blockchains.

Ether ETF Frenzy: Memecoins Explode, Investors Eye SEC Decision


							

Fate of spot Ether ETFs uncertain as deadline nears, VanEck‚Äôs proposal leads.



Memecoins Pepe and Floki Inu prices surge amid speculation of regulatory approval for Ether ETFs



SEC actions hint at potential green light for Ether ETFs, impacting broader crypto market




As the May 23 deadline for the first proposed spot Ether ETF approaches, the fate of such financial products hangs in the balance. Notably, VanEck‚Äôs proposal leads the pack, and despite the uncertainty, recent actions by issuers suggest they are preparing for a potential green light from regulators.



Notably, Ethereum-based memecoins have experienced a substantial price surge alongside ETH tokens amid growing speculation that regulators may be softening their stance on spot ETH ETFs.



Reports that the SEC has asked at least three U.S. firms to revise their applications for listing spot Ether ETFs have further fueled the bullish interest in these memecoins.



Pepe (PEPE) led the rally, rising 29% in the past 24 hours, as per the data from CoinMarketCap, while LADYS surged approximately 25%. On the other hand, Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw a small gain of 3%, while Ether (ETH) itself increased by around 4%, reaching $3,792.



Additionally, Dogecoin (DOGE) also ticked up about 4.5%, while Floki Inu (FLOKI) prices shot up by 14%. Moreover, Ethereum rollup network Mantle (MNT) saw a price surge of 6%.



 
 




The market‚Äôs positive reaction underscores the high stakes and potential impact of spot Ether ETF approvals. Investors are closely watching the SEC‚Äôs decisions, as approval could significantly boost the broader cryptocurrency market by legitimizing and expanding access to Ethereum-based investments.

Ripple CTO Falls Victim to "Sophisticated" Phishing Scam


David Schwartz, chief executive officer at Ripple, recently fell victim to a "sophisticated" phishing scam, according to his recent social media¬†post.¬†Schwartz claims the scam involved opening a support case with Apple. The fraudsters then leveraged real Apple emails and web pages in their SMS messages.¬†The SMS messages were sent to the Ripple executive in order to trick him into giving control over his Apple ID. They were likely able to open a support case with just his email address. "Presumably, Apple wouldn't have given them access. What's clever is using the (real) case to make their (fake) SMS messages convincing," he said.cardThe bad actors somehow managed to obtain Schwartz's email address and phone number. "I'm now sure exactly how they got that, but they're not great secrets," he added.¬†However, Schwartz was not tricked by scammers because their SMS messages had "terrible grammar."Ripple teams up with Facebook to fight scams¬†The latest incident coincided with Ripple launching a new anti-scam initiative in collaboration with tech giant Meta and various cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase.¬†"There‚Äôs one thing all of us in tech can agree on ‚Äì it‚Äôs high time we dismantled the scammers once and for all," Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in his social media post.¬†

Is Bitcoin at risk from Ethereum ETFs? Peter Schiff explains - AMBCrypto



Schiff‚Äôs remarks come amid Bitcoin‚Äôs brief move above $70k.
Bitcoin spot ETFs attract significant institutional investment despite the concerns.

As the world awaits the approval of an Ethereum [ETH] spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), prominent Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has taken the opportunity to attack Bitcoin [BTC].¬†
Schiff sees an upcoming bearish trend for BTC¬†
In a 21st May post on X (formerly Twitter), Schiff suggested that Bitcoin could become bearish if the Ethereum spot ETF is approved. He said,¬†
‚Äú#Bitcoin gained renewed strength from rumors that an #Ethereum ETF will likely be approved. But any money to buy new Ether ETFs will most likely come from existing Bitcoin ETFs. Investors who decided to make an allocation to #crypto won‚Äôt increase that allocation to buy Ether.‚Äù
Schiff highlighted that although the recent rumors about an Ethereum ETF approval have boosted Bitcoin‚Äôs value temporarily, things could turn out differently.
He believes that the funds for these new Ethereum ETFs will likely come from the money currently invested in existing Bitcoin ETFs.
In his view, investors who have already allocated funds to cryptocurrency are unlikely to increase their overall investment in the crypto market just to buy Ethereum ETFs. 
Instead, they might shift their investments from Bitcoin to Ethereum, which could negatively impact Bitcoin‚Äôs price.
Should you trust Schiff‚Äôs remarks?¬†
Needless to say, Schiff‚Äôs remarks sparked a lot of criticism, starting with Rajat Soni, a Bitcoin educator, who claimed,¬†
‚ÄúPeter‚Ä¶ Bitcoin‚Äôs price doesn‚Äôt go up because of Ether. Ether‚Äôs price goes up because of Bitcoin. If you don‚Äôt understand this, your opinion is irrelevant.‚Äù
However, Santiment‚Äôs latest tweet echoed Schiff‚Äôs remarks.¬†
‚Äú#Ethereum is seeing the most #bullish crowd sentiment since September with the #SEC likely to approve the first #ETF‚Äôs, and $ETH‚Äôs price surge. Meanwhile, #Bitcoin & #Solana sentiment is slightly #bearish.‚Äù¬†
Source: Santiment
¬†Bitcoin ETFs see massive inflows¬†
Despite the criticism and uncertainty, Bitcoin spot ETFs have remained a favorite among institutions. On 21st May, Bitcoin ETFs experienced net inflows totaling $305.7 million.
 Leading the pack was BlackRock with an investment of $290.0 million, followed by Fidelity with $25.8 million. Bitwise and VanEck, however, saw outflows of $4.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively.

Bitcoin has experienced a significant surge, with its price climbing nearly 13% over the past week and a half to return to the $70,000 mark per BTC.

Massive XRP Rally Expected With Federal Reserve's $6 Trillion Inflation Shift


								Could the US Federal Reserve‚Äôs potential pivot on inflation be the catalyst for a multi-trillion dollar surge in the cryptocurrency market? That‚Äôs the bullish prediction from some of Wall Street‚Äôs top analysts as they eye a seismic shift in monetary policy.

According to a new report from Forbes, the stage may be set for a remarkable resurgence in the prices of leading digital assets like Bitcoin and XRP. The key driver? An estimated $6 trillion in sidelined capital that could come flooding back into the market as the Fed eases its hawkish stance.
The Floodgates Could Open
This isn‚Äôt just a typical crypto rally. Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, believes in the potential for a transformative, once-in-a-generation event. If the Fed signals that it‚Äôs successfully reined in inflation, he said people could see trillions of dollars rushing back into the market in a matter of months.


Lee‚Äôs bullish outlook is centered around the notion that the Fed will soon declare victory in its battle against soaring prices. The recent deceleration in the US consumer price index, with a 0.3% increase in April versus 0.4% in March, suggests the central bank‚Äôs aggressive rate hike campaign may be bearing fruit.
Should that prove to be the case, Lee believes it could ignite a frenzy of investment activity, with Bitcoin potentially surging to $150,000 ‚Äì more than double its current price of around $71,000. And if history is any guide, other cryptocurrencies like XRP could follow a similar trajectory.
XRP is currently trading at 0.53. Chart: TradingView
Crypto ETFs Provide Institutional Tailwind
Bolstering this bullish case is the recent wave of crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals, which have opened the door for mainstream investors to gain exposure to digital assets. Since January, a number of high-profile Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have launched, providing a crucial on-ramp for institutional capital.
XRP Poised For Resurgence?
All eyes will be on XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which has struggled to regain its former highs after a protracted legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
However, if the broader crypto market does indeed embark on a parabolic rally fueled by that $6 trillion in dormant capital, analysts believe XRP could be one of the biggest beneficiaries. Some are even speculating that the token could soar past the $1 mark ‚Äì and potentially reach even loftier heights ‚Äì if Bitcoin achieves Lee‚Äôs $150,000 target.

XRP has been in the doldrums for a while now, but that could all change in a heartbeat if this predicted crypto boom materializes. With the SEC issue seemingly resolved, XRP is poised for a major resurgence, and we could see it reclaim its former glory as one of the market‚Äôs top-performing assets.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Paints Problematic Picture

Shiba Inu has shown us that it has the potential to break through after the 10% surge and a move above the 50 EMA threshold. However, despite the recovery, numerous data points show that it is not enough, especially as we see no continuation at the current point in time.The recent price chart indicates that while SHIB managed to surge past the 50 EMA, it struggled to maintain momentum. The volume spikes accompanying the price surge were notable, suggesting increased trading activity. However, these spikes did not sustain, reflecting a lack of consistent buying pressure necessary for a sustained breakout.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn-chain signals present a mixed picture. Net network growth and the percentage of addresses in profit ("In the Money") are both showing bullish trends, indicating some positive sentiment and network activity. However, the concentration metric is slightly bearish, suggesting that the asset might still be under the influence of a few large holders, which could lead to price manipulation or sudden sell-offs.Exchange signals offer a slightly more optimistic view. The smart price metric and bid-ask volume imbalance both lean bullish, indicating that on-exchange trading activity is currently favorable. The bid-ask volume imbalance, in particular, shows a significant 6.69% bullish tilt, which could imply a strong demand at current price levels.Despite these positive indicators, the lack of follow-through in price action and the bearish concentration signal highlight the challenges SHIB faces. For a more decisive bullish breakout, SHIB would need to overcome the 200 EMA resistance and attract sustained buying interest. Broader market conditions will also play a crucial role in determining whether SHIB can capitalize on its recent momentum.

Bitcoin Holders Resume Buying After Market Sell-Off


The basic laws of supply and demand determine the price action of any asset, including Bitcoin. When supply exceeds demand, the asset‚Äôs price tends to decline. Conversely, when demand outstrips supply, the price usually rises. 
These same principles apply to cryptocurrencies, and on-chain metrics can provide valuable insights into Bitcoin holders‚Äô behavior.
The Impact of Heightened Profit-Taking
When analyzing a Bitcoin bull market over the long term, the price movement typically exhibits significant upward volatility, mixed with periods of corrections and consolidation. Most investors know that financial markets do not consistently rise, leading to a dynamic interplay between supply and demand, resulting in periodic corrections.
This trend is evident when observing Bitcoin‚Äôs Realized Cap and Realized Profits.

Realized Cap: This adds up the value of all BTC based on the price when they were last moved, giving a clearer picture of the money truly invested in Bitcoin.
Realized Profits: This refers to the actual gains that BTC holders have made when they sell their Bitcoin for more than they paid.

As Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of over $73,000 in mid-March, its Realized Cap also increased, suggesting that most long-term holders were profitable. Consequently, some exited their positions, resulting in a significant spike in Realized Profits.

The rising supply of BTC on the market surpassed the demand levels, leading to a corrective phase that saw the price of Bitcoin dip below $57,000. This drop brought Bitcoin below its Short-Term Holder Realized Price, creating a sense of fear in the market, given that short-term holders are more prone to sell based on price volatility.


Realized Price: The average price at which all BTC were last bought. It is like finding out the average cost everyone paid for their BTC.
Short-Term Holder Realized Price: The average price investors paid for BTC that they have moved around in the last 155 days. These BTC are the ones most likely to be spent or sold soon.
Long-Term Holder Realized Price: The average price investors paid for BTC that they have not moved in over 155 days. These BTC are the least likely to be spent or sold soon.

The Short-Term Holder Realized Price, which currently stands at $60,500, served as an accumulation point despite investors‚Äô fears. Indeed, long-term holders felt comfortable adding more BTC to their positions at this level after realizing profits in March.

Bitcoin Supply-Demand Trends Shift
Bitcoin‚Äôs Long-Term Holder Net Position Change provides a glimpse into this behavior. After undergoing a prolonged distribution period, long-term holders have begun accumulating again, having amassed more than 70,000 BTC since early May.

Long-Term Holder Net Position Change: It shows how the amount of Bitcoin held by long-term investors increases or decreases over time.

Based on the simple laws of supply and demand, as demand for Bitcoin begins to outstrip the available supply of BTC in the market, the odds of Bitcoin resuming its upward trajectory improve.
Bitcoin Holder Net Position Change. Source: Glassnode
Observing Bitcoin‚Äôs Balance on Exchanges can corroborate these supply and demand dynamics.

Balance on Exchanges: This refers to the total amount of Bitcoin held in cryptocurrency exchange wallets.


Since early May, more than 30,000 BTC have moved to private cryptocurrency wallets for long-term holding, showing confidence among holders in Bitcoin‚Äôs future value.
Bitcoin Balance on Exchanges. Source: Glassnode
While assessing the future price action of any asset can be challenging, multiple on-chain metrics can hint at potential price points investors should pay attention to. One of these metrics is the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, which determines whether the price of Bitcoin is unusually high or low based on its historical averages.

MVRV: It stands for Market Value to Realized Value. Market Value is the current price of Bitcoin times the number of BTC in circulation, while Realized Value is the average price at which all BTC were last bought.
Pricing Bands: These bands show the upper and lower limits of Bitcoin‚Äôs price based on its historical MVRV values to help identify when Bitcoin is either extremely overvalued or undervalued based on historical price data.

Bitcoin recently moved back above the +0.5œÉ pricing band, which currently stands at $64,600. Historically, such an upswing has led Bitcoin to test the 1.0œÉ pricing band supported by rising demand. This pricing band is currently hovering around $77,000.

Summary and Conclusions
The basic laws of supply and demand dictate Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. Indeed, prices fall when supply exceeds demand and rise when demand exceeds supply. On-chain metrics offer valuable insights into these dynamics, allowing analysts to understand Bitcoin holders‚Äô behavior.
Recent data reveals a price decline below $57,000 as supply increased. However, long-term holders have demonstrated confidence by accumulating over 70,000 BTC since early May. This trend suggests resilience in the market despite short-term volatility.

Key metrics like Realized Cap and Realized Profits illustrate that many long-term holders were profitable at Bitcoin‚Äôs recent all-time high, leading to a wave of selling and subsequent price corrections. However, the accumulation by long-term holders at lower prices indicates a positive outlook for Bitcoin‚Äôs future value.

Overall, these on-chain metrics help identify shifts in supply and demand, providing a framework to understand Bitcoin‚Äôs price action and investor behavior and indicating potential upward trends as demand begins to outstrip supply.

Donald Trump Accepts Crypto Donations Via Coinbase Commerce Product


							

Trump champions cryptocurrency, promising to build a ‚Äúcrypto army‚Äù and criticizing Biden‚Äôs stance on digital assets.



Trump targets Senator Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs anti-crypto efforts, highlighting a Democratic crackdown on cryptocurrencies.



The campaign criticizes President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren for their efforts to form an anti-crypto army.¬†¬†




Donald Trump, the Republican candidate for the 2024 US Presidential Election, has promised to build a ‚Äúcrypto army‚Äù and announced the acceptance of cryptocurrency donations. During his presidential campaign event on Tuesday, Trump declared his support for cryptocurrency, criticizing President Joe Biden‚Äôs alleged ‚Äúsocialist government control‚Äù over digital assets



Previously, Trump emphasized the urgency of introducing a convenient and comprehensive regulatory framework. In addition, he questioned Biden and his administration‚Äôs anti-crypto stance. Trump asserted that Biden opposes crypto assets without understanding them.



In his recent campaign, Trump criticized US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a notable crypto critic, referring to her effort to build an ‚Äúanti-crypto army.‚Äù By highlighting Warren and Biden in the same context, Trump pointed out the Democrats‚Äô combat against cryptocurrencies. He stated, ‚ÄúBiden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an ‚Äòanti-crypto army‚Äô to restrict Americans‚Äô right to make their own financial choices.‚Äù



The Trump campaign‚Äôs crypto donations enable the candidate‚Äôs followers to donate any cryptocurrencies through the Coinbase Commerce product. Coinbase spokeswoman Julia Krieger commented,




 ‚ÄúCrypto is nonpartisan and moves money forward because its cheaper and faster. The Coinbase platform is open to all candidates this election season.‚Äù 




The campaign added that the limit in contribution and other requirements will be per the regulations of the Federal Election Commission. Denouncing Biden‚Äôs anti-crypto army, the campaign cited, ‚ÄúMAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th!‚Äù¬†









With the Trump campaign‚Äôs announcement to accept crypto donations, Donald Trump has become the ‚Äúfirst major party nominee‚Äù to embrace crypto donations. Meanwhile, Biden warned his supporters, stating, ‚ÄúCryptocurrency executives and oil barons are coming out of the woodwork for Trump.‚Äù

Bitcoin buy calls surge: Here's what it means for your portfolio - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin has seen a rally in buy calls on social media.
However, the coin remains at risk of a correction in the short term.

Bitcoin‚Äôs [BTC] social activity has seen a significant uptick as the cryptocurrency market anticipates the approval of the spot Ethereum [ETH] Exchange-Traded Fund [ETF].
In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Santiment noted that the surging social media discussions about the leading cryptocurrency asset have been mostly positive, with the market making more buy calls than sell calls.
When an asset sees a surge in buy calls among its traders on social media, they are expressing positive sentiment about the asset‚Äôs continued price growth. Some traders even consider it a good entry point, perceiving prices as low and due for an upswing.¬†
BTC holders must look before the leap
While this may offer a good entry opportunity for some, ‚Äúpaper hands‚Äù have been known to sell when an asset‚Äôs social activity increases like this.
This is because the surge in BTC buy calls among its traders is often due to speculation and not backed by a corresponding demand for the coin. Therefore, newer investors who need more conviction in the coin‚Äôs long-term potential might be hesitant to hold during these periods even with positive social sentiment.
Also, short-term traders often see the surge in buy calls as an opportunity to profit. Hence, a temporary sell-off is possible even amidst overall bullish sentiment.
Moreover, BTC‚Äôs Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) ratio returned a high value of 153.19% at press time. The metric tracks the ratio between the coin‚Äôs current market price and the average price of each acquired token.¬†
Source: Santiment
When it surges in this manner, the asset is said to be overvalued, and on average, coin holders are sitting on profits. This may lead to a spike in selling pressure as investors are more likely to take profits when the potential return is high.
The rise in BTC‚Äôs funding rates also heightens the likelihood of a short-term correction in its price.¬†On 21st May, the coin‚Äôs funding rate across cryptocurrency exchanges was 0.018%, its highest level in a month, according to Coinglass‚Äô data.

Generally, when an asset‚Äôs futures funding rate rallies, it is a bullish signal, suggesting a strong demand for long positions.¬†
However, when it gets too high and becomes unsustainable, it may result in forced selling by leveraged long positions. This may trigger price swings and result in unexpected price drops.

Pro-XRP Lawyer Declares 'Corruption Era' Amid New Evidence


								Pro-XRP lawyer and Republican Party candidate for the Senate Massachusetts, John E. Deaton voiced severe criticisms of what he described as pervasive corruption within federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve (Fed). Deaton, through a post on social media platform X, outlined a grim view of institutional integrity in the United States, coining it the ‚ÄúTHE CORRUPTION ERA.‚Äù
Why The Pro-XRP Lawyer Is Outraged
‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve said multiple times, we are living through a period of time history books will later describe as: ‚ÄòTHE CORRUPTION ERA,'‚Äù Deaton asserted. He expressed particular disdain for the ‚Äòrevolving door‚Äô practice, where federal regulators move into high positions within industries they previously supervised. ‚ÄúThe revolving door existing within these agencies must be closed once and for all,‚Äù the lawyer who represented 75,000 XRP holders in the Ripple vs. SEC case emphasized.
Deaton announced his intent to propose and support legislation that would enforce a five-year ban preventing federal regulators from transitioning directly into the industries they once regulated. ‚ÄúA person should not be able to leave the FDA and then immediately go work for Pfizer,‚Äù Deaton explained, highlighting the urgent need for such reforms to dismantle the entrenched networks of influence and self-interest within government bodies.

The conversation around these concerns stemmed from a statement from Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank. Today, Long expressed shock over perceived preferential treatment by the Federal Reserve towards another institution, only weeks after a federal judge has rejected Custodia Bank‚Äôs application for a Fed master account and membership with the Fed.
Her outrage followed the surprising approval of a master account to Numisma, a Connecticut-based fintech bank formerly known as Currency Reserve, which is notably not FDIC-insured nor federally regulated.
‚ÄúI AM SPEECHLESS. Is this what it appears to be ‚Äî special treatment by the Fed for another former insider, just weeks after the Fed‚Äôs Inspector General ‚Äòsuspended‚Äô its investigation into the Fed‚Äôs master account practices?‚Äù Long questioned publicly via X. She highlighted the inconsistency of the Fed‚Äôs stance in the Custodia Bank case, where it previously described such regulatory structures as unsafe and unsound.
‚ÄúThe Fed‚Äôs Custodia denial order went into excruciating detail about why these issues are not curable, but suddenly a bank with the same regulatory structure got a pass by the Fed ‚Äî and an ex-Fed governor is involved? What the ‚Ä¶.,‚Äù she stated.

FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared the scoop: ‚ÄúConnecticut-based fintech bank Numisma (formerly named Currency Reserve) has received conditional approval for access to a Federal Reserve master account, making it the second non-FDIC-insured, non-federally regulated bank to receive one in recent years.‚Äù
Terrett pointed out that both banks granted such approval had direct connections to former Federal Reserve officials, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest and the integrity of the approval process.
The denial of a master account to Custodia Bank is a significant setback for the crypto industry, which sees such access as vital to integrating more seamlessly into the broader US financial system. This access would enable crypto-focused banks like Custodia to offer more efficient, potentially less costly banking services by connecting directly to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs payment systems.
This ongoing situation casts a shadow over the crypto industry and further hints at an ‚ÄúOperation Choke Point 2.0‚Äù, an initiative by the Biden administration to stifle the crypto sector.

RNDR Token Meets Resistance as It Tries to Reclaim All-Time High


Render (RNDR) is poised to break above the upper line of an ascending triangle in continuation of its most recent uptrend.
Logging a 10% price hike in the last two days, the bulls can push above this resistance level if the current general market trend is sustained.¬†
Render May Face Some Difficulties¬†
Render‚Äôs double-digit price rally in the past 24 hours may witness a pullback as some of the token key indicators showed that bearish influence remains dominant.

At press time, the dots that make up RNDR‚Äôs Parabolic SAR indicator exceed its price. This indicator identifies potential trend direction and reversals in the token‚Äôs price.
Render Price Analysis. Source:¬†TradingView
When its dots are above an asset‚Äôs price, the market is said to be in decline. This indicates that the asset‚Äôs price has been falling and may continue to do so. Market participants interpret this as a sign to exit long positions and open short positions.
Also, the value of RNDR‚Äôs Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was -0.01 at the time of writing. This indicator measures money flow into and out of the RNDR market.

RNDR Price Prediction: Negative Sentiments Meet High MVRV Ratio
The poor sentiment currently trails RNDR is depicted in its negative weighted sentiment spotted on-chain. Subsequently,¬†at -0.29 at press time, this metric shows a dominant negative bias in the online discourse surrounding the asset.

This negative sentiment comes at a time when the token‚Äôs Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) ratio is high. As of this writing, this was 231.78%

Render Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment
A high MVRV ratio already suggests a potential correction if the price becomes unsustainable. Therefore, a negative sentiment reinforces this concern, highlighting potential selling pressure that could drive the price down.
Conversely, if selling pressure gains momentum, the token may find it impossible to break above the upper line of the ascending triangle and fall toward $9.8.

However, if this bearish projection is overturned, the token‚Äôs price may exceed $12.

Guru Network X AMA Session With BeInCrypto


We are thrilled to announce an exclusive AMA session with Evgeny Vahteev, the CTO of Guru Network, hosted by BeInCrypto. Join us as we dive deep into the evolution of DexGuru, from its origins as a DeFi trading terminal to its current transformation into the Guru Network, a comprehensive AI-driven platform.¬†
Evgeny will share insights on the vision behind Guru Network, the innovative technology stack powering it, and how it seamlessly integrates trading and analytics for a superior user experience!
AMA Session with Evgeny Vahteev from Guru Network
BeInCrypto: We‚Äôre excited about our upcoming AMA session! Today, we‚Äôre thrilled to welcome a special guest ‚Äî the CTO of Guru Network üî•üòè
üó£ COMMUNITY I‚Äôll ask some questions for Evgeny Vahteev (@evahteev). After that, he will answer the 3 most interesting questions from you (quick reminder: we collected these questions in advance!) üî•
These 3 lucky Community members will get $20 üí∏
What was the primary vision behind creating dex.guru, and how has that vision evolved since its inception?
Evgeny: That‚Äôs a great question, especially given our recent transition to Guru Network. Many people remember us from the Dex Guru Trading Terminal days and wonder why we‚Äôve shifted to a network model, what orchestration involves, and why AI plays a role in it.
We started as DeFi trading terminal providing a unified platform that merges real-time trading with in-depth analytics, and DeFi trading experience by offering both elements in a single, accessible interface.
That was a new concept back then when BNB was just Launched and Poligon was just getting steam. We went through the whole DeFi summer with terminal, got VC funded, and then UST,FTX and winter came, so plans for TGE were postponed, and retail volume dried out mostly we switched to B2B products lineup coming from the same backend.

Here‚Äôs our trading terminal with traders categorization and analytics.
We initially developed a block explorer and then began offering it to various blockchain networks.
The first one was Canto, and then on 18 chains.¬†
We began by offering B2B products to various blockchain networks and soon realized the need to enhance our offerings. This led to the development of the Guru Data Warehouse, expanding our suite of tools to better serve our clients.


At some point, we recognized that our real strength was not merely in providing a data analytics toolset but in offering a comprehensive developer‚Äôs toolkit tailored for the builders‚Äô community. This realization led to the transformation of Guru Data Warehouse into a full-fledged development platform, which eventually evolved into what is now the Guru Network and Flow.
And that path got us all the way to the Guru Multi Chain AI Orchestration layer we are launching in following weeks.
BIC: Please give us an overview of the technology stack that powers dex.guru.
Evgeny: We started at times there were no reliable RPC providers at the market. That‚Äôs why our technology stack starts from nodes we run ourselves for all the chains we support(https://mirror.xyz/evahteev.eth/POoVA0GiX9XcaQXGwQekS7o57pWwKARYzEW4uofwX2E), then we have ETL Pipeline inherited from open-source ethereum ETL(python)¬† extensively developed towards DeFI needs(Prices, Pools, Dexes, Balances etc). Clickhouse DB is a core Storage of Data Warehouse, Next.js, and react applications.
BIC: Dex.guru combines trading and analytics on one platform. Can you explain how this integration benefits users compared to using separate platforms for trading and analytics?
Evgeny: That‚Äôs the concept we started with at DexGuru, where multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXes) were presented alongside trading options across them. Users appreciated the feeling of control and the ability to conduct their own research (DYOR) directly on the platform.
We continued to deliver in that same user-centric manner, and now we offer a data-rich Guru Warehouse analytics suite, fully integrated and embedded within the platform.
We have a new DexGuru V2 Auto coming soon.¬†
BIC: What are some recent innovations or developments that you‚Äôre particularly proud of?

Evgeny: As we expanded our B2B analytics products, we began tackling not just the data-reading aspects but also the execution and orchestration side of things. This led to our first implementation of Chainflow during the ETHOnline hackathon, which further evolved into Flow and, ultimately the Guru Network.¬†
Chainflow served as a proof of concept for the future BBPA (Blockchain Business Process Automation) Engines, which now act as the compute layer on the Guru Network ‚Äì Compute Orchestration Chain.
We then implemented data-aware AI agents in our block explorers, orchestrating them in the same manner as Chainflow. The definitions are done in BPMN standard:

Process definitions are run on Guru Network Orchestration Nodes and synchronized through Inscriptions on Guru Network as they serve as inscriptions producers and indexers at the same time and can trigger events based on messages coming from other engines.

BIC: Our usual question: How do you ensure the platform‚Äôs security and reliability, especially considering the service‚Äôs decentralized nature?
Evgeny: At Dex Guru, we rely on the security mechanisms of our vendors since we function as an aggregator of aggregators. This approach allows us to leverage established, robust security protocols across different platforms to ensure the safety and reliability of our services.
For the Guru Network, particularly regarding the Process Definitions Smart Contracts we plan to deploy, we have dedicated significant time and resources to conduct thorough security audits and reviews prior to the mainnet launch.
BIC: All that Guru Network stuff looks complicated‚Ä¶ How can a simple user get started with it?
Evgeny: That‚Äôs a good question. We are constantly working on simplifying our platform and improving the user experience at Guru Network, as well as enhancing our documentation available at https://docs.gurunetwork.ai/.¬†
BIC: What trends do you foresee in the decentralized space, and how is dex.guru preparing to capitalize on these trends?
Evgeny: We see the DeFi space becoming increasingly complex for users as new financial mechanisms evolve. Recognizing users‚Äô growing demand for Web3 Automation, we are responding by delivering DexGuru V2 Auto.


These Web3 automation functions will help our users track comprehensive trends and automate their usual actions and routines, enhancing their overall efficiency and effectiveness.
BIC: How will Guru Network‚Äôs BBPA engine (Blockchain Business Process Automation) impact the future of DeFi automation? Can you share some specific examples of how it can be used to automate DeFi tasks?
Evgeny: Yes, there are some obvious trading strategy examples visible on the screenshot I provided earlier. But, besides that We envision it as a catalog where Gurus contribute snippets for trades, exit strategies, periodic routines, and other degen activities we all love.
Users can select and deploy automation snippets from the catalog, paying an instantiation fee to the Guru who developed and published the snippet.
BIC: BTW, user experience is crucial for retaining traders and analysts. What steps has dex.guru taken to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience?
Evgeny: We are planning to launch DexGuru V2, featuring a completely new interface and automations, first for a private beta within our Guru NFT Season Pass holders community and then to the public along with Guru Network Mainnet launch.
Let screenshots speak for themselves:



Plus all the automations I‚Äôve mentioned and posted as screenshots earlier.
BIC: What about the community? How important is its involvement in the development and growth of dex.guru?¬†
Evgeny: We have a vibrant community of DeFi users and Guru Season Pass NFT holders.
We are planning to launch initially within our community, offering incentives for invites to the Season 2 NFT Collection and running automations from the tGuru Faucet.¬†




We are tentatively planning to release it in the coming weeks, prior to the TGE and LBP events scheduled for the end of May or June at the latest.
BIC: How will the Guru Network be governed? Will there be a role for token holders in decision-making?
Evgeny: So the community would be able to boost their rewards by helping us make DexGuru V2 Auto better.
We postponed provisional governance two years ago, along with the deferral of our TGE plans at that time.
But now we‚Äôre revisiting that idea and will provide a governance framework for the Guru Network in the coming months before the mainnet launch.
BIC: What can users expect from dex.guru in the next year or two? Are there any major updates or expansions on the horizon?
Evgeny: The Guru Network launch and its ecosystem expansion around the narrative of Web3/AI Orchestration, fostering innovation and integration across technologies and user flows. You can learn more about it here.

VIDEO

Those plans are pretty much covering two-year period.
BIC: Thank you! Let‚Äôs move to the questions from the Community üòà
@MEHEDIIA
The Guru Enlightenment Network (GEN) aims to bridge AI and blockchain technologies. Can you detail how GEN facilitates the orchestration of user flows and business processes across both on-chain and off-chain environments, and what real-world applications this enables?
Evgeny: Guru Flow, a key product within the Guru Network ecosystem, orchestrates user actions, Web3 transactions, data insights, and the compute layer, incorporating prediction models as needed. Real-world applications range from our Web3 Auto POC, demonstrated at https://app.web3auto.guru/, to more complex, business-oriented projects like Pixelpact (https://pixelpact.ai/), our inaugural non-Guru Ecosystem venture. 
Pixelpact focuses on the tokenization of real-world assets, specifically artworks, which are used as the basis for creating unique NFTs. These NFTs, generated through three blending models that incorporate users‚Äô input with original art, represent the real artwork and its value at exhibition events. By minting these NFTs, attendees support artists and engage in subsequent social finance activities available to NFT holders. Those are the basic examples that are already implemented and clickable by users.


BIC: @RenaldoDowd
For those interested in joining the Guru Network community and exploring revenue opportunities, what are the steps to get involved? Where can individuals purchase tokens and sign up to participate in the project‚Äôs ecosystem?

Evgeny: We have multiple layers of network participants within our ecosystem. Gurus who contribute to the agents and AI/Web3 automations. Ecosystem projects which are utilizing the processes from catalog and flow technology as a framework for running their full stack applications in between AI, Web2, and Web3 context and retail who is looking to automate their DeFi routines and GPT tasks with the ability to pick something that works from catalog and start getting results in minutes.
We are currently working on better documentation and guides for each guru network participants audience so it would show a clear pass for participation and earning within the ecosystem.

that‚Äôs from the litepaper.¬†
BIC: @Anastaciaberrios63
How does DexGuru V2 (Auto) differentiate itself from traditional analytics platforms, and what features can users expect from this closed beta release?
Evgeny: On top of our traditional feature reach trading analytics Dex Guru V2 is aiming to provide new Web3 automation features. Those automation scenarios are based on reach data, synthetic indicators, and trained AI models, and executed in a non-custodial fashion in the user‚Äôs controlled environment. That gives a completely new perspective on possible DeFi activities, eliminates human errors, and makes our lives easier. On the other side community members (Gurus) who develop and publish their scripts and agents in the catalog are incentivized by instantiation and infrastructure fees share paid by users who deploy and run them.

We did POC of automation features just recently:

Bitcoin Funds Get $306 Million Boost Ahead of SEC Ethereum ETF Deadline - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsSure, the spotlight has been on spot Ethereum ETF hopefuls since Monday‚Äîbut the already-trading Bitcoin ETFs have gotten a boost from the excitement.Yesterday Bitcoin ETFs saw $306 million worth of funds deposited, according to Coinglass. That's the biggest single day of inflows the category of funds have seen since earlier this month.Yesterday's distribution across the Bitcoin ETFs wasn't exactly even.BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) took in $290 million, while the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw $26 million worth of inflows. That was offset by the Bitcoin Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) seeing $4 million and $6 million worth of withdrawals, respectively.And the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which saw $72.5 million worth of net inflows between May 15 and May 20, was flat on Tuesday, according to Coinglass data.As an aside, the gap GBTC and IBIT has now shrunk to $736 million. That's approximately half what it was less than a month ago. It remains to be seen whether Grayscale's incoming CEO, Peter Mintzberg, will make any changes to the firm's flagship Bitcoin fund.But why would Bitcoin ETFs pump on anticipation for Ethereum counterparts? That could be because some analysts, like Standard Chartered bank, are predicting that an Ethereum ETF approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission could lead both assets‚ÄîBTC and ETH‚Äîto new all-time highs.The global market cap got close to matching that in mid-March, when the Bitcoin price was on a tear and set its currently all-time high of $73,737.94.For Ethereum, that means chasing a price of $4,878.26‚Äîwhich it last saw on November 10, 2021. That's around the time that prices were booming and the global crypto market capitalization inched past $3 trillion for the first time ever.And there are plenty of traders turning to derivatives in hopes it'll do just that. In the past day, Ethereum open interest has surged by 30% to an all-time high of $11 billion, according to Kaiko.As of this morning, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation now includes the VanEck Ethereum ETF on its active and pre-launch list. Hard to say whether that's a sign of an imminent approval, though.Tickers for Bitcoin ETFs appeared and then disappeared on the clearing house and settlement company's list all the way back in October, which was months before the SEC approved any for trading.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Popular Project Banned from Hong Kong! Detected to Violate the Confidentiality of Personal Data! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The Office of the Personal Data Privacy Commissioner (PCPD) has completed its investigation into the Worldcoin project, finding that its activities in Hong Kong violated the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO).
Hong Kong Privacy Commission Orders Worldcoin to Stop Iris Scanning Operations
Privacy Commissioner Ms. Lillian Chung issued an enforcement notice requiring Worldcoin to stop using iris scanning devices to collect iris and facial images from the public.


The investigation revealed that Worldcoin violated various Data Protection Principles regarding the collection, storage, transparency, access and correction of personal data under the KVKK.
In particular, the collection of face and iris images was considered unnecessary and excessive. PCPD criticized Worldcoin's policy of storing personal data for up to 10 years to train artificial intelligence models used in identity verification processes, finding it excessive and unjustified.





Additionally, PCPD found that Worldcoin did not adequately inform participants about the purpose of data collection, their rights, and the means to access and correct their personal data as required by law.
The ‚ÄúPrivacy Notice‚Äù and Consent Form for Biometric Data provided by Worldcoin did not have a Chinese version, and staff at collection sites did not explain or confirm that participants understood these documents.



PCPD conducted multiple visits to six Worldcoin locations in Hong Kong between December last year and January this year, including a court-ordered investigation in late January.
The investigation found that participants in the Worldcoin program were required to consent to the collection of facial and iris images through iris scanning to verify human identities and generate iris codes.





This verification process was a prerequisite for receiving a registered identity and free virtual currency known as ‚ÄúWorldcoin‚Äù.
Worldcoin confirmed that the faces and irises of a total of 8,302 people were scanned during its operation in Hong Kong.
This decision highlights the importance of complying with data protection laws and ensuring transparency and fairness in the collection and use of personal data.

BlackRock's Dominance in Bitcoin ETFs Drives Market to New Highs


							

Spot Bitcoin ETF recorded $306 million in net inflow on Tuesday, May 21.



BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT accounted for $290 million of the total Bitcoin ETF inflow of May 21.



BTC surged 17% amid seven days of consecutive net ETF inflows.




The spot Bitcoin ETF market continued its strong performance with $306 million net inflow on Tuesday, May 21. With this milestone, the spot Bitcoin ETF achieved a consecutive net Outflow for seven days and a day when Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC recorded a $0.00 net inflow.







Meanwhile, the BlackRock IBIT maintained its impressive performance by ranking as the highest in net inflow. IBIT‚Äôs net inflow for Tuesday was $290 million, representing about 95% of the total daily net inflow in the spot Bitcoin ETF market.



Tuesday‚Äôs influx of investment into spot Bitcoin ETFs boosted the total net assets value across all the listed products by 4.29%. Consequently, the spot Bitcoin ETF total net assets after Tuesday‚Äôs inflow reached $58.91 billion, according to data from Soso Value, a financial research platform for crypto investors.



It is worth noting that the consecutive spot Bitcoin ETF inflow significantly affected Bitcoin‚Äôs price. The flagship cryptocurrency surged impressively during this period, pushing closer to the all-time high (ATH) established about two months ago.



Bitcoin started rallying on May 17, recording a daily profit of over 7.5% for the first time in nearly two months. The top cryptocurrency broke above significant resistance around $67,200, surpassing $70,000 for the first time in May.









TradingView data shows Bitcoin gained over 17% in the last seven days, with the bullish momentum intact. The latest rally launched the top crypto back into the bullish range and closer to the current ATH. Several crypto analysts believe a sustained net inflow rate would inject more bullish momentum into Bitcoin‚Äôs uptrend that could see BTC reach a new ATH soon.



Bitcoin traded for $69,826 at the time of writing, following a slight pullback from Tuesday‚Äôs $71,958 high. As Bitcoin edges closer to its all-time high, the sustained inflow into ETFs, driven by products like BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT, underscores a burgeoning confidence in cryptocurrency investments. With market momentum showing no signs of waning, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can sustain its bullish trajectory and possibly set new records.

Is China‚Äôs Bitcoin mining ban the worst decision this century?


    Though the process has been ongoing for a relatively long time ‚Äì and even the most outspoken opponents of the crypto market have been getting involved, including during the ‚Äòcrypto winter‚Äô ‚Äì 2024 has been the year of institutional cryptocurrency adoption.



The trend has been most evident and extensive with regard to Bitcoin (BTC), particularly since the approval of the U.S.‚Äô first-ever spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



Indeed, these financial instruments have seen significant institutional interest in recent months, with investors of all stripes joining the action.







One country that has excluded itself from both the trend and its fruits ‚Äì and which has, arguably, made it difficult for itself to catch up ‚Äì is China.



In 2021, the government of the People‚Äôs Republic banned BTC mining within its borders, which‚Äîthough it has failed to fully eliminate such activity‚Äîhas significantly damaged the once-booming sector.



The ban quickly gutted the Chinese Bitcoin mining sector, which‚Äîafter already declining in global market share between 2019 and 2021‚Äîfell to 0% at one point in 2021, per the data made available through the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI).



Though the figure rose somewhat with activity in China ‚Äì mostly considered to consist of underground operations ‚Äì standing close to 21%, it still marks a substantial drop from the final pre-ban mining market share of 46%.



China unlikely to be able to catch up



Finally, even if the Chinese government assesses in 2024 that its decision was a mistake given the recent mainstream legitimization of Bitcoin, it would likely have a hard time attempting to regain ground.



One of the biggest reasons behind the likely issues is the latest BTC halving that took place in April 2024. The event made it twice as difficult to obtain the coin, with JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) recently revising the estimated cost of mining a single Bitcoin to $45,000.



The concerns associated with the increased mining difficulty are perhaps most evident in the stock prices of major BTC miners ‚Äì such as Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) ‚Äì which have declined since the start of the year despite the crypto market undergoing a large and broad rally.



Nonetheless, with Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs (ATH) in general in March, and, when denominated in yuan, in February, and with other important metrics such as the hashrate also being at their ATH, it is possible China will seek to reverse the ban.



Why China may not regard the ban as a mistake



Ultimately, while it is possible that the recent trends could force the Chinese government to reevaluate its ban, it is far from guaranteed, given that some of the primary stated reasons behind the decision are largely still relevant.



Though Bitcoin has been trading with relatively little volatility in recent years ‚Äì at least by crypto market standards ‚Äì it is doubtful whether the stability has already proven enough to negate the original argument of preserving financial stability.



Indeed, China expressed its concerns that Bitcoin might collapse to $0 as recently as 2022 ‚Äì shortly after the ‚Äòcrypto winter‚Äô started in May of the same year.



Similarly, though China has been working on increasing its reliance on green energy, the supply share has risen by only about 2% from 27.73% in 2021 to 29.14% in 2023, meaning that it is doubtful much has changed regarding the environmental argument.



Finally, the last major reason for the ban‚Äîconcerns over capital flight‚Äîhas arguably only increased given the global economy‚Äôs increased exposure to crypto markets and the higher rates of cryptocurrency adoption.



On the other hand, there have been some developments in China that hint toward a mode dovish stance on crypto, such as a conference in Nanjing that took place in late April and that saw a number of scholars agree on the need to afford digital assets a more concrete legal status in the country.

Trump Reportedly Made Over A Million In Recent Crypto Rally As Ex-President's Investments In Ethereum And Memecoin MAGA Continue To Surge - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump's cryptocurrency holdings have sparked widespread media interest and investigation in recent months. The firebrand leader, who has strongly marketed his pro-crypto stance in the ongoing election campaign, profited handsomely from the market's recent rally.¬†What Happened: Trump's crypto portfolio was worth $8.65 million at the time of publication, according to data from Arkham Intelligence.The largest holding in his portfolio was Maga Coin TRUMP/USD, a memecoin inspired by the "Make America Great Again" political movement. The crypto rose 9% in the rally this week, pushing his total investments to $4.81 million, an increase of $520,000.The second-largest holding was Ethereum ETH/USD, followed by Wrapped Ether WETH/USD. Combined, Trump had nearly 815 ETH and WETH, worth more than $3 million at the time of writing.¬†¬†ETH witnessed a 21% surge this week on higher expectations of spot Ether ETF approval, meaning that the rally added more than 500,000 to his ETH-WETH portfolio.¬†¬†Overall, Trump's crypto portfolio gained more than a million in the rally, indicating a 13% increase.¬†Why It Matters: Donald Trump is one of the biggest celebrity cryptocurrency owners, with one prior Arkham report revealing him to be at the top of the list in terms of crypto holdings of X celebrities with over a million followers.Coins such as ETH and WETH have been gained from the sale of NFT products featuring his name and likeness, while the project designers delivered the memecoin TRUMP to his address as a token of gratitude.The Republican challenger has looked to counter his arch-rival, President Joe Biden on the subject of cryptocurrencies and regulations. He also started accepting cryptocurrency for official campaign donations.¬†Read Next: Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day!

Bitcoin Price (BTC-USDT) Analysis for 22 May 2024: Key Support and Resistance Levels Explained by Macro Trader | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 22 May 2024, a detailed analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price action was shared by pseudonymous analyst Bitmidas on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). This analysis provided an in-depth look at the market dynamics, offering valuable insights into the current and future state of BTC‚Äôs performance.







The analysis began by noting a divergence between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on the previous day. While ETH managed to stabilize, BTC struggled, adjusting towards $69,413.07 and eventually bottoming at $69,162.94. It was highlighted that today‚Äôs support level is shifting to $69,031.98, and despite the oscillations, the overall trend remains bullish.



There was a significant net outflow of $16.81 billion the previous day. Although the price drop was modest, the high price and trading volume meant that outflows nearly matched the prior day‚Äôs inflows. BTC attempted to stabilize but failed to follow ETH‚Äôs performance, breaking below $70,495.27 and adjusting towards $69,413.07.



Despite the failed stabilization attempt, BTC is still within a bullish oscillation. The key support zone for the day is identified as $69,031.98 to $68,544.98, with the price likely to oscillate between this zone and $71,016.08. If BTC can maintain the level of $70,495.27 for 4-8 hours, it could potentially target $71,016.08. Breaking this minor resistance might lead to higher targets of $72,860.67 to $73,320.85. However, multiple dips below the support zone of $69,031.98 to $68,544.98 could shift the trend to a bearish oscillation.



Additional data on capital flow shows that the support range is between $68,544.98 and $65,844.59. The daily sentiment remains predominantly bullish at 90%, with a slight 10% bearish outlook. The long/short ratio stands at 1.19, indicating a slight advantage for long positions. Funding rates range from 0.01% to 0.0213%, reflecting a strong but slightly receding bullish sentiment. The total contracts in the market amount to $350.9 billion, a 0.92% increase, and the greed index is at 76, suggesting a high level of market optimism. The turnover rate is at 25%, indicative of active trading.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The analysis continued by discussing the minor adjustments due to BTC‚Äôs failed stabilization. Early data showed a slight tug-of-war between bulls and bears, with bulls attempting to reclaim stabilization points and bears pushing towards the capital flow support levels. The increased oscillation suggests traders should exercise caution.



Despite the recent volatility, BTC remains in a long-term bullish trend. There are no immediate low-entry opportunities, and ongoing observation of macroeconomic data is essential. The long-term strategy still favors buying on dips, reinforcing a cautiously optimistic outlook.



Finally, the broader economic environment was considered. Several Federal Reserve officials made cautious statements, indicating that they are closely monitoring monthly data. They hinted at potential rate cuts in the fourth quarter of 2024, which could have significant implications for the crypto market.







While technical analysis can provide valuable insights into market trends and potential price movements, it does not guarantee future performance. Market conditions can change rapidly due to various factors, including economic events and investor sentiment. Traders should use technical analysis as one of many tools in their decision-making process and remain aware of the inherent risks involved in cryptocurrency trading. Always consider your own risk tolerance and financial situation before making investment decisions.

                        The U.S. prosecutors are pushing for a prison sentence of five to seven years for the former FTX executive Ryan Salame.According to a sentencing memorandum, the attorneys of the Southern District of New York have argued for an extended imprisonment term, citing the seriousness and the general deterrence in imposing sentence.Former FTX Executive‚Äôs Crimes of Seriousness
The document stated that Salame was first the head of the Settlements Team at Alameda and then CEO of FTX Digital Markets from 2019 to 2022, during which he assisted Samuel Bankman-Fried in ‚Äúperpetrating aspects of the interrelated frauds.‚ÄùThe attorneys elaborated that Salame was found guilty for ‚Äúunlicensed money transmission and false statements to banks‚Äù and ‚Äúunlawful political contributions through Alameda.‚Äù‚ÄúFor instance, he was relied upon to integrate FTX into the Bahamas (Def. Mem. at 9), and he spoke to Caroline Ellison about ways to retrieve funds from cryptocurrency exchanges in China that had frozen Alameda accounts (Tr. 830),‚Äù the memo reads.The memo also included the recommended sentence of 120 months‚Äô imprisonment by the Probation Office, considering serious offense conduct, the large amounts of money involved, and the need for general deterrence.‚ÄúIn light of the defendant‚Äôs serious crimes, which were designed to undermine the integrity of the U.S. campaign finance system and the U.S. financial system, a substantial term of incarceration, well above the 18 months‚Äô he requests, is required,‚Äù the memo reads.Salame Requests 18 Months or Less
The lawyers of the defendant submitted the sentencing memo on May 14, urging a prison time no longer than 18 months.‚ÄúSuch a sentence would satisfy the purposes of sentencing ‚Ä¶ while allowing Ryan to have the opportunity to continue contributing positively toward society,‚Äù the defendant‚Äôs sentencing memo reads.Salame‚Äôs attorneys argued that he did not play a central role in the fraudulent activities and lost a significant portion of his personal fortune with the collapse of FTX. The sentencing is scheduled for May 28

Economist Henrik Zeberg Issues Dire Warning, Says Fed Cannot Stop Major Recession at End of 2024 - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed economist is warning that a major economic event last witnessed almost a century ago will likely rear its ugly head in 2025.
Henrik Zeberg tells his 140,700 followers on the social media platform X that he sees risk-on assets such as stocks and crypto going higher and higher for the next few months.










However, the economist predicts that the bullish conditions will abruptly subside toward the end of the year, just as market participants become extremely exuberant.
‚ÄúYou may not like it. You may not understand it.
But the bull market has an end date ‚Äì this year! A blow-off top!
First US markets will explode higher. Crypto and small caps will soar as we see a rotation from large caps and foreign markets (outside the US).
Everybody will become euphoric and once again trust that the Fed will have our backs.
But a major recession will set in at the end of the year.‚Äù¬†
According to Zeberg, the Fed will try to support the economy by printing money to stimulate growth. But he says the Fed‚Äôs actions will only delay an economic collapse that will eventually give rise to stagflation ‚Äì a period of slow economic growth with climbing unemployment and high inflation.
‚ÄúFed will intervene ‚Äì yes ‚Äì but will only create a bounce in markets, as they enter with monetary stimulus when recession and deflation stare them in the eyes.
They will offset stagflation! 
Consequence: largest recession and bear market since 1929 in two stages. First deflation, then bounce, later stagflation.‚Äù
In January 2023, Zeberg predicted that the stock market would reach record highs before witnessing a sudden crash. At the time, the S&P 500 was trading at around 4,000 points and Bitcoin was worth close to $20,000.
At time of writing, the S&P 500 is hovering at 5,321 points and BTC is trading at $70,150.

Crypto Market Eyes Ether ETF Approval: Lubin Cautions on Supply Constraints


							

Joe Lubin warns of a potential Ether shortage with the launch of the Spot Ether ETF, raising supply concerns.



Bloomberg analysts increase Ether ETF approval odds to 75%, signaling a significant shift in market sentiment.



ETH sees a substantial surge, trading at $3,757 with 27% of the supply staked, highlighting growing market interest.




Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin has warned of a potential scarcity in the Ether (ETH) supply following the launch of the Spot Ether ETF. While anticipation of the ETF launch grows, Lubin asserted that the ‚Äúfloodgate‚Äù of ETH demand might lead to a significant shortage in supply.



Though the community was initially pessimistic about the SEC‚Äôs decision on Ether ETFs, reports suggest a potential approval of nine Ether ETF issuers‚Äô applications this week. Meanwhile, Bloomberg‚Äôs ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds of Ether ETF approval from 25% to 75%.







Reflecting on the positive development in the industry, Lubin highlighted a potential increase in the demand for Ether and Ether ETFs, noting that Spot Bitcoin ETF investors may ‚Äúlikely want to diversify into that second approved ETF.‚Äù



Lubin asserted, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether.‚Äù However, he added that Ether will be insufficient at the time to satisfy the demand.









Comparing the Bitcoin ETF launch and Bitcoin‚Äôs supply at the time with the Ether ETF and ETH supply, Lubin argued that the ETH tokens available will be much fewer than Bitcoin. Providing further insights, Lubin pointed out, ‚ÄúMuch of the Ether is put to work in the core protocol, DeFi systems, or in DAOs.‚Äù His arguments highlight that a significant portion of ETH supply will be unavailable for ETF consumption.



As of press time, ETH is exchanging hands at $3,757, marking a daily increase of 3.2%. Over the past 7 days, ETH has seen a substantial surge of nearly 30% and 16% surge over the last 30 days. While Ether holds a total supply of 120,128,511 ETH, according to onchain data, 27% of the supply is staked across the Ethereum network.

Uniswap Responses to SEC: Crypto Tokens Are Not Securities


Uniswap Labs, the leading developer of the decentralized trading platform on Ethereum, asserted that the US Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) potential enforcement action against it lacks merit. 
According to the New York-based startup, crypto tokens should not be classified as securities. Instead, they are files similar to PDFs.
Why Crypto Tokens Are Not Securities

On Tuesday, Uniswap Labs contested the allegations that it operates an unregistered exchange and broker-dealer. This response follows a Wells notice served by the SEC‚Äôs Enforcement Division last month, indicating plans to recommend legal action against the company.
Marvin Ammori, Chief Legal Officer of Uniswap Labs, spoke at a press conference, emphasizing the SEC‚Äôs flawed assumption that all tokens are securities. Uniswap Labs also argues that now, the SEC risks an adverse decision that could limit its authority over crypto tokens.

‚ÄúTokens are, in fact, simply a file format. They are a file format for value and they are not inherently securities. The SEC has to essentially unilaterally change the definitions of exchange, broker and investment contract in order to try to capture what we do.‚Äù Ammori said.

In a 40-page response, the company expressed its readiness to litigate if necessary, asserting confidence in its legal standing. 
SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has consistently argued that decentralized exchanges fall within the SEC‚Äôs regulatory scope. He has stated that many digital assets are unregistered securities subject to SEC rules. 
However, Uniswap Labs maintains that UNI tokens, its governance tokens, do not qualify as securities under the Howey Test. This legal standard from a Supreme Court ruling defines investment contracts. 
In light of these developments, Uniswap‚Äôs UNI token saw a 4% increase in value over the past 24 hours, trading at $9.63.

The broader crypto market closely watches the SEC‚Äôs actions, especially as the US election approaches and crypto becomes a significant political issue. Some believe that the SEC‚Äôs stance on crypto may be shifting. Also there are expectations that the SEC will approve spot Ethereum ETFs on May 23. 

This anticipated approval is believed to result from political pressure. Crypto enthusiasts speculate that the Biden administration and former President Donald Trump might have realized the crypto community‚Äôs growing influence. 
Not to mention, Trump‚Äôs campaign recently allowed donations via crypto, signaling a more crypto-friendly approach.

Waiting for Ethereum ETF? Analyst predicts launch delay - AMBCrypto



ETH ETF approval could be likely, but the official launch could take some time, per analyst.¬†
Mixed feelings on the potential threat of ETH ETF, if approved, to BTC ETFs.¬†

Crypto markets rallied early in the week following a positive update on US spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF approvals.¬†
However, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, despite the positive SEC update on the ETH ETF approvals, the official launch and listing could take longer.¬†
‚ÄúStill a potentially long way from a launch. But these filings prove that all of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate.‚Äù
Notably, on 21st May, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) submitted five amended 19b-4s on behalf of Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark Invest/21Shares, and Franklin Templeton.¬†¬†
While this renewed interest and update was positive, Seyffart added that,¬†
‚ÄòNeed to actually see SEC approval orders on all the 19b-4s, AND THEN we need to see S-1 approvals. Could be weeks or more before ETFs launch.‚Äô¬†
The 19b-4s forms are exchange rule changes submitted by exchanges for new funds, while S-1 filings are from individual issuers. Both forms must be approved before launching ETFs.¬†
Staking feature removed from Ethereum ETF filings
Another important update on the process was the apparent removal of ETH staking wordings from the recently amended 19b-4s filings.¬†
According to Seyffart, the amended filings replaced previous staking wordings with outright clear writing, 
‚ÄòFund‚Äôs ETH cannot be staked by anyone.‚Äô
Most market watchers have long argued that the staking feature could complicate the approval process and raise questions about ETH‚Äôs ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô status.¬†
Nevertheless, some quarters aren‚Äôt happy with the swift approval of ETH ETF, given that Bitcoin ETFs took almost 10 years to achieve. One user claimed that an ETH ETF approval will indicate that the ‚Äòmarket is not regulated by competent actors.‚Äô
The user added that the approval will make ETH a Bitcoin equivalent, yet Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem is full of ‚Äòcentralized sh*tcoins.‚Äô
On his part, Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, asserted that ETF inflows could help ETH come out of the shadows of Solans[SOL] and BTC.¬†
In fact, Thompson added that ETH ETF, if approved, could attract inflows from BTC ETFs. Even Peter Schiff echoed Thompson‚Äôs sentiment. If confirmed, it remains to be seen whether ETH ETF could be a threat to BTC ETFs.

Kakarot ZK-EVM Launches Testnet, Paving The Way For EVM-Compatibility On Starknet - The Defiant

Kakarot Labs is backed by StarkWare and Vitalik Buterin.Starknet, the seventh-largest Layer 2 network by TVL, will soon enjoy EVM-compatibility, opening the floodgates to established DeFi protocols within the Ethereum ecosystem.On May 22, Kakarot Labs launched the public mainnet phase for its modular Cairo-based zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The move sets the stage for Starknet's ecosystem to become EVM-compatible, with the popular Layer 2 leveraging the Cairo programming language and facilitating¬†smart¬†contract execution via its bespoke CairoVM.‚ÄúKakarot is essentially an Ethereum execution engine built with Cairo,‚Äù said Elias Tazartes, CEO and co-founder of Kakarot Labs. ‚ÄúIn time, this engine will be integrated into Starknet appchains, thus allowing any ZK-rollup that uses the Cairo stack to be EVM compatible.‚ÄùThe Kakarot ZK-EVM¬†was¬†first¬†created¬†in October 2022 through a joint development effort from the StarkWare Exploration Team and the open-source Starknet developer community.In June 2023, Kakarot Labs¬†announced¬†a pre-seed investment round featuring participation from StarkWare, the team behind Starknet, and Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum‚Äôs chief scientist.EVM-compatibilityWhile Starknet currently ranks as the seventh-largest Layer 2 with more than $1 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to L2beat,¬†the lion‚Äôs share of its TVL was achieved¬†through its long-anticipated¬†STARK airdrop¬†on Feb. 20.The drop was the largest in the history of web3, with the project distributing $2.1 billion worth of tokens at a $30 billion fully diluted valuation per STARK‚Äôs initial trading price. The drop also catapulted Starknet‚Äôs TVL more than 550% to $1.22 billion from $187 million overnight.However, Starknet‚Äôs modest pre-airdrop TVL illustrates the barriers posed to the network's growth by its lack of EVM-compatibility, with its TVL having sluggishly risen from $56 million in May 2023 to $187 million in February. By contrast, many EVM-compatible L2s have quickly garnered momentum by enabling established protocols leveraging Solidity ‚Äî Ethereum‚Äôs primary coding language ‚Äî to¬†easily migrate¬†onto new networks.‚ÄúToday, developers looking to build on the Starknet Stack faced the challenge of learning Cairo, the programming language developed especially for STARK cryptography, distinct from Solidity, the mainstay language of Ethereum,‚Äù Kakarot Labs said. ‚ÄúThe introduction of Kakarot zkEVM will eliminate this barrier by enabling developers to use Solidity, thereby fostering a more inclusive environment within the ecosystem.‚ÄùKakarot‚Äôs public¬†whitelist¬†phase is the first of three test network deployments, with the project set to follow up with a public¬†whitelist¬†and permissionless public testnet launches.The project said its testnet deployments will allow developers to experiment.¬†familiar¬†tooling such as MetaMask and Foundry within a Cairo-based setting. ‚ÄúBy participating in this phase, developers can test and optimize new protocol changes and the latest advancements in crypto user experiences,‚Äù Kakarot said.

Target Q1 Revenue Declined by 3.1%, EPS Short of Expectations - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our¬†website policy¬†prior to making financial decisions.



Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) reported its first quarter 2024 financial results, reflecting a performance consistent with its expectations. The company posted a total revenue of $24.53 billion, a 3.1% decrease from the previous year‚Äôs $25.32 billion. This decline was driven by a 3.2% drop in total sales, partially offset by a 3.9% increase in other revenue. The operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion, down 2.4% from the prior year‚Äôs $1.33 billion, primarily due to lower sales volume.



The first quarter operating income margin rate improved slightly to 5.3% from 5.2% in the previous year. This improvement was attributed to a 140 basis point increase in the gross margin rate, which rose to 27.7% from 26.3% last year. The gross margin rate benefited from cost improvements that offset higher promotional markdown rates, favorable category mix, and lower book-to-physical inventory adjustments compared to the prior year.



Target Fails to Meet EPS Forecast in Q1, Revenue in Line with Expectations



Target‚Äôs performance in the first quarter matched the company‚Äôs projections but fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company reported a diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.03, slightly below the expected $2.06. This figure also represented a minor decline from the previous year‚Äôs EPS of $2.05. Despite the shortfall in EPS, the company‚Äôs revenue of $24.53 billion closely aligned with the forecasted $24.51 billion.



Comparable sales for the quarter declined by 3.7%, which aligned with the expectations. This decline included a 4.8% decrease in store-originated sales, partially offset by a 1.4% increase in digitally-originated sales. Notably, same-day services grew nearly 9%, led by more than 13% growth in Drive Up. The company also saw continued growth in the Beauty category, which helped mitigate declines in discretionary categories.





Target Corporation Expects Q2 EPS to Range Between $1.95 and $2.35



Target Corporation provided guidance for the second quarter and the full fiscal year 2024. For the second quarter, the company expects a 0% to 2% increase in comparable sales and projects GAAP and adjusted EPS to range between $1.95 and $2.35. For the full year, the company maintains its forecast of a 0% to 2% increase in comparable sales, with GAAP and adjusted EPS anticipated to be between $8.60 and $9.60.



The company‚Äôs leadership expressed optimism about returning to growth in the second quarter. Brian Cornell, chair and CEO of Target Corporation, highlighted the improved topline performance for the third consecutive quarter, driven by growth in the digital business, particularly in same-day fulfillment services. Cornell emphasized the company‚Äôs commitment to delivering value and convenience to consumers, supported by the successful relaunch of the Target Circle loyalty program, which added over 1 million new members in the first quarter.



Target Paid Dividends of $508 Million, ROIC Improved



Target‚Äôs operational efficiency showed mixed results. The company‚Äôs SG&A expense rate increased to 21.1% from 19.8% the previous year, reflecting lower sales and higher costs, including pay, benefits, and marketing investments. Despite these higher expenses, disciplined cost management helped mitigate the impact on the overall financial performance. The company‚Äôs net interest expense decreased significantly to $106 million from $147 million last year, primarily due to higher interest income from increased cash balances.



On the capital deployment front, Target paid dividends of $508 million, reflecting a 1.9% increase in the dividend per share. However, the company did not repurchase any stock during the quarter, leaving approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program. Additionally, the company‚Äôs after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) improved to 15.4% from 11.4% in the prior year, driven by higher operating income and higher average invested capital.

Every 96th person on the planet currently owns at least $1 in Bitcoin


    Though the road has been rocky, with the 12 months starting in May 2022 being particularly dark for the industry, cryptocurrencies have, nonetheless, shown their resilience and continued their integration with the global financial systems.



So far, 2024 is proving to be a particularly eventful year given that it started with the approval of the U.S.‚Äô first-ever spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) ‚Äì instruments that have already done much to expand investors‚Äô exposure to the crypto market.



Bitcoin adoption is also evident in another statistic ‚Äì the number of addresses that hold at least $1 worth of the coin.¬†







Indeed, in 2022, Finbold reported that there are as many as 35 million addresses holding at least $1 worth of BTC ‚Äì up to 0.4% of the global population at the time.



Figures retrieved in May 2024 from BitInfoCharts.com indicate that the number has risen significantly, and there are, in fact, as many as 84 million such addresses. This means that approximately one out of every 96 people in the world might own at least some Bitcoin ‚Äì slightly more than 1% of the global population of 8.1 billion.



Number of addresses with more than $1 worth of BTC. Source: BitInfoCharts



It is important to note that this figure represents an upper bound, as a single individual may hold Bitcoin in multiple accounts, resulting in more than one address per person.



Likewise, at least some of the rise might be accounted for by the increase in the price of the cryptocurrency as Bitcoin price today stands at $69,953 following a 66.10% year-to-date (YTD) rise.



BTC YTD price chart. Source: Finbold



Drivers for Bitcoin ownership



It is, in general, likely that the ongoing crypto market boom is responsible for the number of relevant Bitcoin addresses as investors were likely keen to take advantage of the rally.¬†



The trend was only boosted by the bullish forecasts surrounding the latest BTC halving event ‚Äì which occurred in April ‚Äì and by the mainstream legitimization offered by the Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) approval of Bitcoin ETFs.



Indeed, though many prominent cryptocurrency advocates are generally not appreciative of SEC‚Äôs hawkish approach to the industry, there is a strong possibility that the higher levels of discussion stemming from enforcement actions¬† ‚Äì along with the sense of a lawman arriving in the Wild West ‚Äì has done much to make digital assets appear as sensible investments to more traditional traders.

Dycom Industries (DY) Shines with $1.142 Billion in Contract Revenues - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our¬†website policy¬†prior to making financial decisions.



Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE: DY) announced its fiscal 2025 first-quarter results, showcasing a notable performance improvement. The company reported contract revenues of $1.142 billion, reflecting a 9.3% increase compared to $1.045 billion in the same quarter last year. This growth includes a 2.5% organic increase, excluding $71.2 million from acquired businesses. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA rose to $130.9 million, or 11.5% of contract revenues, up from $113.5 million, or 10.9%, in the previous year. Net income also significantly rose to $62.6 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, compared to $51.5 million, or $1.73 per diluted share, in the prior year.



During the quarter, Dycom repurchased 210,000 common shares for $29.8 million, reflecting confidence in its financial health and future prospects. The company‚Äôs strategic acquisitions and organic growth have contributed to this robust performance, indicating a well-executed business plan. The increase in net income was partly due to income tax benefits from the vesting and exercise of share-based awards, amounting to $5.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $2.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year.



Dycom Industries Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



Comparing the current quarter‚Äôs performance against expectations, Dycom significantly outperformed the anticipated earnings per share (EPS) of $1.51 by delivering $2.12 per diluted share. This represents a substantial positive variance, showcasing the company‚Äôs ability to exceed market forecasts. Additionally, the actual revenue of $1.142 billion surpassed the expected $1.09 billion, highlighting a strong demand for Dycom‚Äôs services and effective execution of its projects.



The company‚Äôs performance metrics, such as Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and net income, indicate a successful quarter beyond just meeting expectations. The Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 11.5% from 10.9% in the previous year, suggesting better operational efficiency and cost management. The increase in net income, bolstered by higher revenues and tax benefits, further underscores Dycom‚Äôs robust financial health and strategic prowess.





Dycom Expects Contract Revenues to Grow by High Single Digits for the Next Quarter



Dycom provided optimistic guidance for the next quarter ending July 27, 2024. The company expects organic contract revenues to grow by high single-digits compared to the same quarter last year, alongside approximately $70 million from acquired contract revenues. This forward-looking statement suggests continued growth and integration of recent acquisitions, which are expected to contribute positively to the overall revenue.



Additionally, Dycom anticipates an increase in Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of contract revenues by 25 to 75 basis points compared to the quarter ended July 29, 2023. This guidance indicates a focus on maintaining and potentially improving operational efficiencies while scaling up revenues. Investors and stakeholders can access detailed guidance and additional information on the company‚Äôs website, reflecting Dycom‚Äôs commitment to transparency and informed investor relations.

These efforts have been backed by the intense deflationary push through its¬†burn rate and aggressive¬†Shibarium transaction growth.With these apparent efforts, Shiba Inu is arguably moving in tandem with the broader market. It is following the slower pace of the combined market to chart its growth course. However, there are expectations that the token will print a breakout in the long term.

Bitcoin ETFs See Significant Increases as Markets Lock on Ethereum ETF Approval! Which Company Is Leading? Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States are seeing significant investment inflows, recording their seventh consecutive day of net inflows on Tuesday. This increase in interest comes amid growing excitement over the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs Experience Strong Inflows Amid Ethereum ETF Speculation
A total of $305.72 million was transferred to spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to data from multiple sources.



BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust led the way, attracting $290 million of total inflows. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund also had a positive impact, bringing in $26 million.

In contrast, Grayscale's transformed Bitcoin Trust, which experienced cumulative net outflows of $18 billion, recorded no net inflows on Tuesday.
Bitwise Bitcoin ETF and VanEck Bitcoin Trust were the only funds to see outflows, with net losses of $4 million and $6 million, respectively. Other spot Bitcoin ETFs did not report any inflows or outflows.






Since their introduction to US exchanges, spot Bitcoin ETFs have been extremely popular, generating total net inflows of $13.17 billion.
The recent success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has shifted the focus in the cryptocurrency and financial markets to the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.


The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly asked exchanges to amend their 19b-4 filings earlier this week, hinting at a possible move towards approval of these products.

How a Bitcoin Pizza Trade Pushed Decentralized Money into the Spotlight 14 Years Ago - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our¬†website policy¬†prior to making financial decisions.



Fourteen years ago, on May 22, 2010, two pizzas were bought for 10,000 BTC, a transaction worth over $700 million today. This historic event marked the first documented real-world use of Bitcoin. It demonstrated the potential of decentralized digital currency, setting the stage for a revolution in finance.



Bitcoin is the World‚Äôs First Widely-Adopted Decentralized Digital Currency 



Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs first decentralized digital currency, was introduced by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. The concept behind Bitcoin was to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that would operate without a central authority, such as banks or governments. Decentralized currencies like Bitcoin offer several advantages over traditional currencies, including lower transaction fees, increased security, and the ability to conduct transactions without intermediaries.





A Programmer from Florida Paid 10,000 BTC for Two Large Pizzas



On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer from Florida, made a post on the BitcoinTalk forum offering to pay 10,000 BTC for two large pizzas. On the forum, Jeremy Sturdivant (known as ‚Äújercos‚Äù) accepted the offer and arranged to deliver two Papa John‚Äôs pizzas to Hanyecz‚Äôs home. This transaction, worth roughly $41 then, marked the first documented real-world use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, demonstrating the cryptocurrency‚Äôs potential for everyday transactions.



The pizza transaction had an immediate impact on the Bitcoin community. It validated Bitcoin‚Äôs use case and encouraged other users to explore real-world applications for the cryptocurrency. The transaction also attracted early media attention, sparking growing curiosity about the potential of digital currencies.



Over the years, the significance of the pizza transaction has only grown. The value of Bitcoin has skyrocketed, with 10,000 BTC worth over $700 million as of 2024. The Bitcoin Pizza Index, which tracks the value of the pizza transaction over time, has become a popular way to illustrate the cryptocurrency‚Äôs growth. The transaction also paved the way for technological advancements in blockchain technology and inspired the creation of numerous other cryptocurrencies.

                        Stephen Findeisen, popularly known as ‚ÄúCoffeezilla‚Äù on YouTube, has accused artificial intelligence company Rabbit AI of orchestrating a nonfungible token (NFT) scam and attempting to cover it up.Findeisen, a prominent investigator on the video-sharing platform, recently released a video¬†on the Coffeezilla channel, shedding light on Rabbit AI‚Äôs alleged involvement in the NFT space.According to Findeisen‚Äôs findings, Rabbit AI was previously known as Cyber Manufacture Co. and managed to raise $6 million for an NFT project named Gama.However, the company‚Äôs founder and CEO, Jesse Lyu, later distanced Rabbit AI from the world of cryptocurrencies, stating that they would ‚Äúnever touch crypto‚Äù in Discord statements.Fun Little Project
Lyu claimed that Gama was merely a ‚Äúfun little project‚Äù he participated in during the COVID-19 pandemic and that he left the project once the associated game was open-sourced.Contradicting Lyu‚Äôs claims, Findeisen presented recordings in which Lyu discussed ambitious plans for the Gama project.In those recordings, Lyu expressed intentions of investing millions into Gama to create a groundbreaking NFT experience.He also mentioned future plans for a concept called Gamaverse and the potential for a clean energy initiative in relation to Gama Coin.Findeisen raised concerns about the $6 million funding raised for the Gama project, questioning where the money had been allocated.Despite Rabbit AI‚Äôs assertion that the funds were solely used for the NFT project, Coffeezilla argued that Rabbit AI‚Äôs foundation was built on the remnants of the Gama project, making it a matter of concern.Additionally, Findeisen criticized the overhyped nature of Rabbit AI‚Äôs viral R1 product, drawing parallels between the exaggerated promises made by both Gama and R1.Coffeezilla‚Äôs allegations are not isolated, as others have also expressed skepticism about Rabbit AI‚Äôs offerings.Josh Olin, the founder and CEO of WeGPT, previously labeled Rabbit‚Äôs project as a ‚Äúscam,‚Äù characterizing it as a quick cash grab designed to lure in investors.Logan Paul-Coffeezilla Cryptozoo Controversy
Online detective Coffeezilla has made himself a reputation by uncovering crypto scams.Specifically, he made headlines last year for going after popular YouTuber and influencer Logan Paul to expose his ‚Äúscam‚Äù project CryptoZoo.CryptoZoo was launched in September 2021 with much fanfare, with Paul himself being one of the founders of the project.The game utilized its own cryptocurrency called ZooCoin, with buyers able to purchase ‚Äúeggs‚Äù that would hatch into randomized animals with different rarities.These animals could then be bred to create cross-bred creatures that would act as NFTs. The NFTs could be held or burned to earn more ZooCoin, purportedly providing buyers with significant returns on their investments.However, in a three-part series of videos uploaded at the end of 2021, Coffeezilla alleged that CryptoZoo had been largely abandoned shortly after its launch.He claimed that Paul distanced himself from the project, despite the extensive pre-release attention he had given it.In response to Coffeezilla‚Äôs allegations, Paul released a video blaming the co-founders and advisors of CryptoZoo for any wrongdoing and sensationalizing the story. He even threatened to sue Coffeezilla.¬†

Smart traders take millions in profit from this crypto as retail FOMO in


    High recent on-chain activity has registered at least three smart traders taking profits from the popular meme coin PEPE. These cryptocurrency whales have made millions of dollars in trades as retail jumps in with ‚ÄòFear of Missing Out‚Äô (FOMO).



Finbold gathered this data from four different Lookonchain reports posted on X on May 22, suggesting a reversal could happen.



PEPE smart traders‚Äô whale activity



First, an early buyer deposited all their 182.9 billion PEPE holdings, worth $2.53 million, into a Binance account. This was the remaining amount of a $462 initial purchase of 324.9 billion PEPE last year. In total, this smart trade rendered over $3.4 million in profits.

Second, the institutional investment firm BlockTower Capital sent $2.8 million worth of 202 billion PEPE to Cumberland, a known market maker that provides liquidity for institutional and retail trading. The transaction happened as the meme coin price broke through $0.000014 per token.



This was a six-day swing trade that earned BlockTower Capital $578,000 in profits on a $2.22 million investment.

Last, a smart trader deposited $2.83 million of PEPE to the Bybit crypto exchange as its third profitable trade. This trader is considered smart due to its 100% win rate trading PEPE, for an estimated total profit of $2.48 million.

FOMO: Retail and whales are still buying



Meanwhile, a few hours after the last activity, another whale withdrew $7.95 million in 592 billion PEPE from Binance. Lookonchain estimates this resulted from a two-day purchase during a notable price pump for the meme coin.







On May 19, Finbold reported another trader who lost $300,000 in two days of bad trading decisions with PEPE.



Moreover, Finbold gathered data from Santiment showing an increased social volume, indicating increased retail interest. Usually, these social indicators peak a few days before a trend reversal, as smart trader whales take profit over the FOMOing retail.

Meme coins and the Greater Fool Theory



Meme coins, such as PEPE, often lack fundamental value and are driven by hype and social media buzz. Traders who buy these coins are essentially gambling in the hope that someone else will buy them at a higher price.



This mentality aligns with the ‚ÄúGreater Fool Theory,‚Äù which suggests that profits can be made by buying overvalued assets and selling them to a ‚Äúgreater fool.‚Äù



However, this theory also highlights the inherent risk of such investments, as the market eventually runs out of willing buyers. When the hype dies down, and demand dwindles, traders can be left holding worthless cryptocurrencies, leading to substantial financial losses.

Crypto security: $22 million returned to Gala Games

A couple of days ago, a security incident occurred involving the crypto of Gala Games.
 A hacker managed to access the platform with the administrator address of Gala Games, and created 5 billion new GALA tokens.¬†¬†

Subsequently, he transferred approximately 4,600 ETH to 0x, and sold 600 million of the tokens he minted on Uniswap, cashing in 21 million dollars.¬†
Subsequently, 4.4 billion GALA tokens were burned.


The return of the bull and bear funds¬†
Yesterday, more than 5,900 ETH (over 22 million dollars) were sent from the hacker‚Äôs wallet to Gala Games.

L‚Äôipotesi √® che abbia deciso di restituire parte del bottino.¬†
According to Gala Games, the decision would have been the result of their timely and effective response, and the involvement of law enforcement.¬†
‚Äú`html
As they stated yesterday in a post on their official blog, the unauthorized wallet was locked down in record time, and the funds were returned because the security measures proved to be effective.
‚Äú`
Something similar, however, had also happened in the past, so it is difficult to imagine that the security measures worked 100%. 
The reaction of Gala Games: our crypto security worked
On Monday afternoon, an unusual transfer of GALA tokens occurred on the Ethereum network worth 200 million dollars.
Gala Games promptly responded by activating the blocklist protocol of GalaChain, to quickly block any further unauthorized minting and movement of GALA tokens, thus mitigating the effects of the incident.
Thanks to the swift intervention, within 45 minutes of the unauthorized minting, approximately 90% of the GALA tokens minted by the hacker were blocked.¬†
This was made possible thanks to a new feature implemented with the update to version v2.
Subsequently, Gala Games contacted the U.S. federal law enforcement authorities, hoping that they will initiate a thorough investigation and appropriate legal action against the culprits.
They also claim that the minting capabilities of GALA on GalaChain would still be secure, because the internal controls and multisig security protocols are designed to protect against such incidents and are continuously improved to keep up with new potential threats.
They have also decided to reimburse anyone who has been subject to unreasonably high transaction fees associated with this incident.
Gala Games:¬† La questione della sicurezza crypto¬†
Security on blockchain smart contracts is fundamental because they are public and accessible to everyone.¬†
In this case, the violation was carried out against the Gala platform, and in particular against the administrator‚Äôs account.¬†
Despite this, they claim that their security measures are solid and effective, and that they are committed to maintaining the highest standards of security and transparency.¬†
They justify the problem by saying that being pioneers in unknown territories can sometimes be a risky activity, but they assure that GalaChain is well-equipped to handle any unforeseen challenge that Web3 may throw.¬†
The token GALA
Today the price of the GALA token on the crypto markets has increased by 13%.
In reality, it has simply returned to the level prior to the news of the incident, given that on Monday it was above 46 thousandths of a dollar and today it has returned to just below 47 thousandths.¬†
Yesterday it had dropped to below 42 thousandths, with a daily loss of more than 12%.¬†
It is worth noting that at the beginning of 2024 it was at 30 thousandths, and during the month of February it rose significantly, reaching a peak of over 87 thousandths in early March.¬†
In April, however, it had already fallen below 35 thousandths, but only to bounce back above 50 thousandths at the end of the month.¬†
In May, it first fell below 39 thousandths and then recovered and rose above 46.¬†
The current price is in line with that of April 25, and it is 55% higher than at the beginning of the year.¬†
It should be remembered, however, that it is still down by as much as -94% compared to the highs of 2021, but that was a truly gigantic speculative bubble.¬†
At the end of 2020, the price was below 1 thousandth of a dollar, and by March 2021 it had already risen above 30 thousandths, which is a level in line with the current one.¬†
The bull si √® gonfiata da settembre a novembre, quando nel giro di poco pi√π di due mesi il prezzo schizz√≤ ad oltre 824 millesimi.¬†
The burst of the bubble ended in January 2023 when the price had fallen below 17 thousandths. Even in November, it was just above 18 thousandths.¬†
Sure, here is the translation:
‚Äú`html
The company Gala Games¬†
‚Äú`
Gala Games √® una piattaforma di gaming che vuole restituire ai gamer il controllo sui loro giochi. 
Their mission is to create blockchain games, but with the goal of radically changing the online gaming market.¬†
Their platform is also equipped with a voting mechanism, based on the Founder‚Äôs Node, which allows players to express their opinion on the games that Gala should develop and on which games should receive funding.¬†
Since its launch in 2019, Gala Games has reached 1.3 million active users and has sold over 26,000 NTF.¬†

Bitcoin (BTC) Hovers Around $70K After ETF Records Month-High Inflows

Bitcoin hovered around the $70,000 mark during the European morning, a slight drop following Tuesday's rally to as high as $71,400. BTC is currently priced at $70,069, around 1.6% lower over 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), offering a measurement of the broader digital asset market, fell about 0.5%. BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded over $290 million in inflows on Tuesday, its highest one-day figure since April 5 and nearly three times the previous high this month: $93 million on May 16. As a whole, ETFs took on nearly $300 million in net inflows on Tuesday.

WisdomTree, Managing $111 Billion, Received Approval to List Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the SEC's critical decision on spot Ethereum ETFs was awaited, positive news came from the UK.
WisdomTree has received approval to launch Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) investment products (ETP) on the London Stock Exchange, Coindesk reported.


World-renowned asset manager WisdomTree (WT) announced that it has received approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to list Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
In the statement made today, it was stated that WisdomTree's Physical Bitcoin (BTCW) and Physical Ethereum (ETHW) ETPs will begin trading on May 28 and will be open to professional investors only.





The company, which has more than $111 billion in assets under management and a spot BTC ETF (WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund -BTCW) approved in the US, has been offering crypto products on European exchanges since 2019.
The FCA banned crypto derivatives, including ETPs, in January 2020. But the FCA said it would not object to requests from financial institutions seeking to list ETPs for professional investors, softening its bans after such crypto-based products have been widely used in Europe for several years and the approval of spot ETFs in the US in January.


While the FCA has approved crypto ETPs for professional investors, the ban remains in place for retail investors.

Global Bitcoin ATM Numbers Decline for the First Time Since July 2023



                    

For the first time since July 2023, the number of active Bitcoin ATMs worldwide has decreased.



The United States and Canada dominate the Bitcoin ATM landscape, accounting for 91.4% of the global network. The U.S. hosts 31,089 (82.6%) machines, while Canada has 2,909 (7.7%).




In 2024, countries worldwide significantly contributed to the month-on-month increase in Bitcoin ATMs, nearly reaching the 38,000 mark lost in January 2023. 



However, the 10-month-long global growth streak ended when over 300 ATMs went offline in May 2024. 



As of May 21, the U.S. market saw a loss of 302 Bitcoin ATMs, and Canada lost 28 machines.




Despite these losses, new Bitcoin ATMs in Australia, Switzerland, and Europe helped reduce the net decline to 280 machines at the time of publication.



Law enforcement agencies in the U.S. actively pursue and shut down Bitcoin ATMs frequently used for extortion and scams.

However, the reasons behind the recent sharp decline in their numbers remain unclear.




Australia hosts the third-largest network of active Bitcoin ATMs after the U.S. and Canada, with 1,041 (2.8%) machines.



Bitcoin Depot, the largest ATM operator in the U.S., recorded steady earnings in 2024. 



The firm stated in its 10-K annual report filed on April 15 that there was no correlation between its revenues and the price of Bitcoin historically.



‚ÄúBased on our own user surveys, a majority of our users use our products and services for non-speculative purposes, including money transfers, international remittances, and online purchases, among others,‚Äù Bitcoin Depot wrote.



According to the ATM operator, the lack of correlation between Bitcoin Depot‚Äôs revenues and the BTC price is partly due to the nature of the services provided.

Trump crypto donations: Better 'financial choices' or 'another cow to milk'? - AMBCrypto



Donald Trump has started accepting crypto donations for his 2024 presidential campaign.
Cryptocurrencies see an increased importance in the political discourse.

As anticipation builds for the United States presidential elections of 2024, former President Donald Trump has made a bold move.
On the 21st of May, Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign launched a fundraising page, enabling federally permissible donors to contribute using cryptocurrency through Coinbase Commerce.
This move stands in stark contrast to his opponent, President Joe Biden, who has been known to advocate for stricter crypto regulations.
Trump‚Äôs bold move
The announcement highlighted the reasons behind this decision and read,
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement reflects President Trump‚Äôs commitment to an agenda that values freedom over socialistic government control.‚Äù
Providing further insight into the Trump campaign‚Äôs intentions, the announcement emphasized,
‚ÄúBiden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an ‚Äòanti-crypto army‚Äô to restrict Americans‚Äô right to make their own financial choices. MAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th!‚Äù
The remark on the ‚Äòanti-crypto army‚Äô was made in line with Warren‚Äôs re-election ad in March 2023.
Donald Trump donations are a paradigm shift¬†
These recent developments underscore a notable shift in the political landscape: in previous election cycles, cryptocurrency held little sway.
However, heightened regulatory scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) targeting numerous crypto firms has ignited a debate among voters.
This newfound attention has pushed cryptocurrency into the forefront of political debate and campaign tactics, making it a big deal in the 2024 elections.
These developments beg the question: Will Trump‚Äôs recent actions reduce Biden‚Äôs chances of winning the election?
Trump‚Äôs various pro-crypto stance¬†
Trump has actively embraced cryptocurrency, including selling limited-run NFT trading cards for cryptocurrency in December 2023 and hosting a lavish dinner for his NFT buyers at the Mar-a-Lago club earlier in May.
In contrast, Biden‚Äôs campaign reflects his administration‚Äôs cautious stance towards cryptocurrency and its proponents.
Well, Trump is not the first to accept crypto donations. Back in 2015, Sen. Rand Paul accepted Bitcoin donations for his presidential campaign.
Additionally, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also announced in May 2023 that his independent presidential bid would accept bitcoin donations.
However, despite Trump‚Äôs efforts to gain traction in the presidential race, David Hoffman, co-founder of Bankless, argues that his pro-crypto stance is nothing more than a joke.

Could Investors Cause Toncoin (TON) Price Correction?


Toncoin‚Äôs (TON) price failed to mark a new all-time high despite attempting to breach the key resistance of $7.0.
The likely reason behind this is the declining optimism of investors, which is evident in their behavior.
Toncoin Holders Hold Back

Toncoin‚Äôs price is experiencing the effect of declining bullishness among investors. The reason behind this is the lack of conviction among TON holders, which was visible in the downtick of the Mean Coin Age.
Mean Coin Age is a blockchain metric that calculates the average age of all coins by considering the time each coin has remained in its current address. It helps gauge the behavior of long-term holders and overall network stability.
The uptick in this indicator shows investors are holding onto their assets while the downtick hints at supply moving around the addresses. TON has noted a downtick since February, but the broader market cues kept increasing Toncoin‚Äôs price.

However, with the cues dissipating, the lack of conviction could show its effect on the price action.
But it‚Äôs not just the existing investors that are pessimistic; the potential TON holders are not too bullish either. This is evident in the network growth falling to a two-and-a-half-month low.¬†
Network growth is measured by the rate at which new addresses are formed on the network identified by their participation. It assesses whether the asset is gaining or losing traction in the market.

Since this indicator fell by 70% within a week, potential investors do not have much incentive at the moment. This may be reflected in Toncoin‚Äôs price action¬†going forward.
TON Price Prediction: Key Support Level to Watch

Toncoin‚Äôs price attempted to breach the resistance of $7.0 but failed to trickle back in the last ten days. Consequently, TON fell below the crucial psychological support level of $6.5. A recent broader market rally pushed the altcoin above this support but could not sustain it, falling to trade at $6.2.
This bearishness will loom over Toncoin‚Äôs price unless the investors‚Äô behavior changes. As a result, the cryptocurrency could fall to test the support at $6.0. Losing this support could lead to a dip to $5.4.

However, if Tocnoin‚Äôs price does not fall below the $6.0 support level, it could bounce back to $6.5. Flipping it into a support floor would enable recovery, potentially sending TON to $7, invalidating the bearish thesis.

A Deep Dive Into P2P

Editorial Note: The following content does not reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions. 
A look at the P2P exchange market and platforms, pros and cons, and more.¬†
Crypto has become a huge part of our lives over the years, but we still use fiat to pay for most of the services we use in our everyday lives ‚Äì which means there‚Äôs been a demand for easy conversion since the dawn of crypto.¬†
One of the oldest, most trusted and popular ways to exchange coins to fiat out there is as decentralized as the whole crypto universe itself ‚Äì it‚Äôs P2P, or Peer-to-Peer exchange, where users swap directly with each other.
A Quick P2P Market Overview
The properly decentralized P2P approach contrasts sharply with traditional centralized exchanges, where a single entity controls the order book and facilitates trades. P2P platforms empower users with full control over their transactions by allowing them to agree on terms and execute trades directly with each other.¬†
One of the defining features of P2P exchanges is their reliance on a network of users instead of a centralized system. This not only enhances privacy and security but also aligns with the foundational principles of blockchain ‚Äî decentralization and user empowerment. Each participant in a P2P transaction uses software that directly connects them with other participants without needing a middleman, which can reduce fees and increase transaction¬† transparency.
Moreover, P2P platforms often incorporate sophisticated trust and reputation systems that allow users to rate each other based on their transaction history. This feature helps build a community of trusted users and mitigates the risk of fraud. Additionally, many P2P exchanges provide an escrow mechanism, where the cryptocurrency being traded is held by the platform until both parties confirm that the terms of the transaction have been met. This safeguard reassures users and enhances the reliability of trading on these platforms.
The importance of P2P exchanges has grown in regions where access to traditional banking is limited or where financial regulations restrict the use of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. In these areas, P2P platforms offer a vital service, enabling inclusive participation in the global digital economy. Moreover, the adaptability of P2P exchanges allows them to serve a wide array of markets, catering to a diverse user base with varying needs and trading preferences.
Overall, the P2P market continues to expand due to all the perks it offers, and remains the most popular way to exchange crypto, despite other features being introduced by platforms.¬†
P2P Services: a Quick Overview
P2P platforms are designed to facilitate direct transactions between ordinary users in the cryptocurrency market. Here‚Äôs a closer look at some of the core services provided by P2P platforms:

Escrow Services: One of the most critical services offered by P2P platforms is the escrow system. When a trade is initiated, the cryptocurrency is held in escrow by the platform until all parties fulfill their parts of the deal. Only when both the buyer and the seller confirm that the transaction terms have been satisfied does the escrow release the funds. This service significantly reduces the risk of fraud and increases trust among platform users.
Reputation and Rating Systems: To enhance trustworthiness, P2P platforms often incorporate user ratings or reputation systems. Users can rate each other based on their experiences after a transaction is completed. These ratings are then compiled into a comprehensive reputation score for each user, visible to other participants. This transparency helps users make informed decisions about whom they choose to transact with.
Decentralized Dispute Resolution: Despite the best efforts of participants, disputes may still arise. Many P2P platforms have mechanisms for decentralized dispute resolution where neutral arbitrators or the community itself can get involved to adjudicate disagreements based on evidence provided by the transaction parties. This approach not only helps resolve conflicts fairly but also maintains the integrity of the trading environment.
Multi-Currency Support: Most P2P platforms support a wide range of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, allowing users from different geographic locations to trade in their preferred currencies. This inclusivity enhances the platform‚Äôs accessibility and utility, catering to a global audience with diverse needs.
Privacy Protection: In keeping with the ethos of cryptocurrency, P2P platforms typically offer more robust privacy protections compared to centralized exchanges. While users might still need to verify their identity to comply with regulatory requirements, the trading process itself can often be conducted anonymously, with no need for personal information to be exchanged between trading partners.
User-Friendly Interfaces: To attract and retain users, P2P platforms strive to offer clean, intuitive user interfaces that simplify the process of trading digital assets. Whether a novice or an experienced trader, the platform‚Äôs design ensures that users can navigate their trading environment effortlessly.


These services make P2P platforms an appealing option for users looking for a more personalized and secure trading experience. By combining the traditional benefits of cryptocurrency, like decentralization and privacy, with innovative trust-building tools, P2P exchanges are setting a new standard in the digital trading space.
A Look at the EMCD P2P Exchange

Robust Security Measures: Given its background in mining and its established infrastructure, EMCD places a strong emphasis on security. The platform implements advanced security protocols to protect users‚Äô funds and personal information. Regular security audits and compliance with the latest cybersecurity practices ensure that the platform remains secure against potential threats.
User-Friendly Interface: EMCD‚Äôs platform is designed with user experience in mind. The interface is intuitive, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced traders. This ease of use is critical in attracting a broader audience and facilitating smooth transactions.
Local and International Bank Integration: EMCD‚Äôs integration with local and international banks is a standout feature that simplifies the process of fiat deposits and withdrawals. This service is particularly valuable in Eastern Europe, where users may face challenges with international banking transactions related to cryptocurrency trading.
24/7 Customer Support: EMCD offers round-the-clock customer support to address any issues that users may encounter. Quick and responsive support is essential in the P2P exchange space, where timely assistance can make a significant difference in user satisfaction and trust.
Community and Educational Resources: Understanding the complexities of cryptocurrency trading can be daunting for many. EMCD provides extensive educational resources to help users understand market trends, trading strategies, and the basics of cryptocurrency. Additionally, a strong community presence on platforms like Telegram allows users to engage with peers and experts, fostering a supportive trading environment.
No Regional Restrictions: Unlike some exchanges that limit access based on geographic location, EMCD offers its services without regional restrictions. This inclusivity ensures that users from various jurisdictions can access the platform, trade, and benefit from its services without hindrance.

The combination of these features makes EMCD not just a platform for trading but a comprehensive ecosystem that supports its users‚Äô needs from mining to trading and learning. As the platform continues to evolve, it aims to maintain its commitment to providing secure, accessible, and user-friendly services, solidifying its position as a leading P2P exchange in the cryptocurrency space.
P2P: Pros & Cons
P2P cryptocurrency exchanges represent a significant shift away from traditional financial systems by decentralizing the control over currency trading. This model has several advantages and disadvantages, which are crucial for traders to understand.
Pros:
Decentralization

Direct Transactions: In P2P exchanges, trades occur directly between parties without the need for an intermediary. The platform only facilitates guarantees for transactions, securing them by freezing funds in escrow until the transaction is finalized.¬†
Personal Responsibility: Users have control over their wallets, which minimizes the risk of losing assets to hacks of platforms.

Privacy and Anonymity

Confidentiality: P2P platforms generally require less personal information from their users, which can provide higher levels of privacy.
Protection from Identity Theft: Reduced sharing of personal details helps protect against identity theft.

Cost Efficiency

No Fees: P2P platforms typically have no fees, since they don‚Äôt have to maintain expensive infrastructure or pay intermediaries.
No Middlemen: The absence of middlemen can further reduce transaction costs, making it more economical for users.


Global Access

Inclusive: P2P exchanges can offer services in regions where traditional banking is inaccessible or limited, providing more people with access to the cryptocurrency market.
No Geographical Limitations: Users can trade across borders without incurring the high fees usually associated with international transactions.

Flexible Payment Methods

Diverse Payment Options: P2P platforms often support a wide range of payment methods including bank transfers, online wallets, and even cash, making them more accessible.

Cons:
Complexity and Usability

Steep Learning Curve: New users may find P2P platforms more complex and less intuitive than centralized exchanges.
User Responsibility: The need for managing one‚Äôs own security can be daunting for some, as P2P does not provide the same level of user support as centralized platforms.

Security Concerns


Scam Risks: While escrow and reputation systems help mitigate risk, scams can still occur. Users must be vigilant and prudent in their dealings.
Dispute Resolution: Resolving disputes can be more complicated without a central authority to adjudicate conflicts.

Liquidity Issues

Variable Liquidity: Depending on the asset and the specific P2P platform, liquidity can be lower than on centralized exchanges, potentially making it harder to complete large transactions quickly.
Price Volatility: Lower liquidity can lead to higher price volatility; prices may vary more significantly than on centralized platforms.

Speed of Transactions

Dependency on Participants: Transaction speeds depend on the responsiveness of the counterparty, which can lead to delays if the other party is not prompt.
Manual Processes: The need to manually find and secure trades can slow down the process, especially for less popular assets or payment methods.


Regulatory and Legal Risks

Uncertain Regulation: The legal status of P2P trading is still unclear in many jurisdictions, which could pose risks of sudden regulatory changes affecting the ability to trade or withdraw funds.
Compliance Requirements: While anonymity is a benefit, it also places the onus on users to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations regarding taxation and cryptocurrency trading.

Conclusion
P2P platforms offer a compelling alternative to traditional and centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, especially for those valuing privacy, lower fees, and direct control over their transactions. However, these advantages come with the responsibility of managing one‚Äôs own security and the potential for less liquidity and slower trades. 
For many, the benefits of P2P exchanges outweigh the drawbacks, particularly in regions with restricted access to traditional banking services or where users seek to avoid heavy regulation. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, the role of P2P platforms is likely to expand, driven by increasing demand for decentralized financial services.

SEC Chair Gensler Criticizes FIT 21 Crypto Bill, Warns Of 'New Regulatory Gaps' - Benzinga

The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) would undermine investor protections and hinder the SEC‚Äôs regulatory efforts, the financial watchdog‚Äôs Chair Gary Gensler stated on Wednesday.What Happened: ‚ÄúFIT21 would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk,‚Äù Gensler warned.A joint effort by the House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, FIT21 aims to delineate the roles of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in overseeing cryptocurrency. The bill introduces the term ‚Äúdigital commodity‚Äù for digital assets not classified as securities, placing them under the CFTC‚Äôs jurisdiction.Gensler argued that FIT21 disregards long-standing regulatory precedents for investment contracts and places the SEC in a difficult position for certifying self-proclaimed digital commodity issuers. He emphasized that the bill overlooks the Supreme Court‚Äôs Howey Test precedent, compromises investor protections, and potentially exposes investors to undue risk without adequate disclosures.‚ÄúU.S. securities laws, developed after the Great Depression, were designed to protect consumers by enforcing disclosures and providing tools for regulators and investors to safeguard customers,‚Äù Gensler noted. He pointed out that the crypto industry has been reluctant to comply with these established regulations.Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Ethereum ETFs Could Drive ‚ÄòMass Adoption‚Äô ‚Äî What Investors Need To Know NowGensler also criticized the bill for removing investment contracts recorded on a blockchain from the statutory definition of securities, thus excluding them from federal securities laws‚Äô protections. He highlighted that this exclusion contradicts court rulings that many crypto assets are offered and sold as securities under existing laws.The bill‚Äôs provision allowing companies to self-certify as issuers of ‚Äúdigital commodities‚Äù is problematic, Gensler said, because it gives the SEC only 60 days to evaluate whether these assets meet the bill‚Äôs criteria‚Äîa timeframe he deemed insufficient given the vast number of digital assets in circulation.Gensler also expressed concerns about the bill‚Äôs definition of a digital commodity, which he argued ignores the Howey Test and the economic realities of assets. He cautioned that the bill‚Äôs investor protection framework and the exclusion of exchanges could increase risks to the public.Moreover, Gensler warned that FIT21 might harm the broader U.S. capital markets by enabling companies to circumvent SEC oversight through decentralized networks.The House of Representatives is expected to vote on FIT21 later on Wednesday.However, the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate and is unlikely to become law this year.What‚Äôs Next: For further insights into regulatory developments and their impact on the digital asset space, join industry leaders at Benzinga‚Äôs Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.This gathering will delve into the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape.Read Next: SEC Could Approve Spot Ethereum ETF ‚ÄòThis Week:‚Äô ReportImage: Shutterstock

Gary Gensler Criticizes FIT21 Crypto Bill Before House Vote


US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has publicly opposed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a bill to regulate digital asset markets. He believes the bill would weaken the SEC‚Äôs ability to protect investors by reclassifying crypto assets and reducing regulatory oversight.
At the same time, The House is set to vote on the bill, which faces notable opposition and an uncertain future in the Senate.
SEC Chair Criticizes FIT21 Act for Reducing Regulatory Oversight

In a Wednesday report, Gary Gensler expressed his strong opposition to the FIT21 Act. The bill, introduced in July 2023 by Chairman Glenn ‚ÄúGT‚Äù Thompson and backed by several key Republicans, aims to establish clear federal guidelines for digital asset markets. It seeks to balance innovation with strong consumer protections and clarifies the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission‚Äôs (CFTC) roles in regulating cryptocurrency.
Gensler argues that the bill undermines classifying crypto assets as investment contracts. This change would remove these assets from the SEC‚Äôs oversight, making it harder to protect investors.
Read more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?

He noted that FIT21 might enable crypto firms to self-certify their products as ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù digital commodities, thus avoiding SEC scrutiny. Gensler warned that the SEC‚Äôs limited resources would hinder its ability to challenge these certifications, leaving much of the crypto market unregulated.
Gensler also criticized the bill‚Äôs definition of a digital commodity. He said that it ignores the Howey Test and the economic realities of the assets. Furthermore, he warned that FIT21 could harm the broader US capital markets by allowing companies to evade SEC regulation through decentralized networks.

‚ÄúThe bill would remove investment contracts that are recorded on a blockchain from the statutory definition of securities and the time-tested protections of much of the federal securities laws. By removing this set of investment contracts from the statutory list of securities, the bill implies what courts have repeatedly ruled‚Äîbut what crypto market participants have attempted to deny‚Äîthat many crypto assets are being offered and sold as securities under existing law,‚Äù Gensler explained.

Stuart Alderoty, Ripple‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer (CLO), shared his thoughts on Gensler‚Äôs stance and current approach to crypto regulation.

‚ÄúHe thought he was above Congressional oversight. That‚Äôs all gone. He‚Äôs now a struggling political liability,‚Äù Alderoty said.

The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill on Wednesday. However, its passage through the Senate remains to be determined. If enacted, the bill would alter the Howey test and significantly reduce the SEC‚Äôs oversight of crypto assets. Introduced in 1946, the Howey Test determines if a transaction qualifies as an investment contract and, thus, a security.

At least eight House Democrats support the FIT21 Act and may gain more backers. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is reportedly considering supporting the bill. Despite no longer being in Democratic leadership, Pelosi‚Äôs opinions still influence many House Democrats.
If Pelosi supports the bill, she would go against Ranking Members Democrats Maxine Waters and David Scott, who both oppose it. They express concerns that the bill would result in the mass deregulation of crypto and some traditional securities. They see this deregulation severely undermining US capital markets by removing key protections for investors and consumers.

BeInCrypto previously reported that Waters and Scott urged their colleagues to vote against the bill. However, House Democrats leaders have stated they will not whip against the FIT21 bill. As the debate continues, the vote‚Äôs outcome and its implications for the future of US crypto regulation remain uncertain.

Bitcoin Pizza Day: A $700 Million Reminder of Cryptocurrency's Rise


							

Bitcoin Pizza Day marks the first documented Bitcoin transaction, now worth $700 million



Early adopter spent over 100,000 BTC on various goods, missing out on immense potential wealth



Bitcoin, despite bearish sentiment, remains a store of value with a rich and celebrated history




On this day in 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida-based software developer, etched his name in history by purchasing two pizzas with 10,000 Bitcoin (BTC). This marked the first documented commercial transaction using the original cryptocurrency. Five days before the purchase, Laszlo posted a request on the BitcoinTalk forum, seeking to exchange Bitcoin for pizza.



Today, with Bitcoin trading near $70,000, those two Papa John‚Äôs pizzas would be valued at over $700 million. Fourteen years ago, they cost a mere $41. This historic transaction is now commemorated annually as Bitcoin Pizza Day on May 22, a celebration of the cryptocurrency‚Äôs remarkable evolution.







In a 2019 interview with journalist Anderson Cooper, Hanyecz reflected on this transaction, noting that dwelling on the immense Bitcoin fortune exchanged for two pizzas would be counterproductive. Beyond the pizzas, Hanyecz made various other purchases with Bitcoin, spending over 100,000 BTC in total. Had he retained this amount, he could have been among the largest Bitcoin holders today.



Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs initial conception as a means of payment, it has not yet achieved widespread adoption for this purpose. However, it has thrived as a store of value, with many holders anticipating price appreciation. Recently, CoinEX launched the ‚ÄúOne Bite of Bitcoin‚Äù campaign on Bitcoin Pizza Day, inviting the global crypto community to join in the festivities.









Currently, Bitcoin is experiencing a bearish trend. BTC price has dipped by 1.93%, now trading at $69,764. Additionally, the trading volume has declined by 22.90% to $39.98 billion. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has fluctuated between a high of $71,426.98 and a low of $69,191.12.



The value of the Bitcoins spent on the pizzas is also referred to as the Bitcoin Pizza Index. This index serves as a poignant reminder of Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric growth and its unrealized potential. The community‚Äôs celebration of Bitcoin Pizza Day underscores the significance of this transaction in the annals of cryptocurrency history.

Is the altcoin season ‚Äòmaniac phase‚Äô about to flip on?


    Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent surge to a record $71,000, followed by a pullback, has set the stage for what many in the cryptocurrency sector believe could signal the onset of an altcoin season.



The coming two weeks are set to be pivotal for the entire altcoin industry. The United States House of Representatives is preparing to vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).



Additionally, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to vote on spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) ¬†later this week. Speculation about the likely approval of both the FIT21 bill and the spot Ethereum ETFs has been rife, driving increased activity in the crypto markets.







At press time, the global cryptocurrency market cap stands at $2.73 trillion, a 0.45% decrease in the last 24 hours.



Market movements and trends



The cryptocurrency market began the week with strong bullish momentum, led by Ethereum‚Äôs (ETH) recent surge to $3,800, which in turn has driven notable gains across major altcoins.¬†



Historically, Bitcoin initiates market cycles with a robust surge, but significant action typically unfolds during its consolidation phases, where other cryptocurrencies take the lead.¬†



This trend is expected to become more pronounced in the upcoming period, driven by varying forecasts from leading analysts



Analysts‚Äô insights



Prominent crypto analyst Micha√´l van de Poppe observed that the altcoin market cap, referred to as TOTAL2, has completed its recent correction.¬†







Poppe suggested that the altcoin market cap is well-positioned for a rally to retest its all-time high (ATH). Additionally, most altcoins, led by Ethereum, have broken out of a bullish flag pattern in recent days.¬†



Another well-known analyst, Rekt Capital, noted in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that the altcoin market cap, excluding the top 10 cryptocurrencies, has successfully retested the $250 billion level as a support level over recent weeks.



Crypto total market cap excluding top 10. Source: Rektcapital/X



According to his analysis, the altcoin market cap is expected to surge to $315 billion before retracing back to the $250 billion mark. This retracement is projected to be followed by an explosive surge above the $440 billion market capitalization.



Investor sentiment



Prominent analyst¬† advise investors not to panic and to prepare for the upcoming ‚Äúmaniac phase.‚Äù Prominent crypto analyst Crypto Yoddha shared that the recent dip was ‚Äòjust a higher low in an uptrend.‚Äô



According to his analysis, the altcoin market is looking to retest the $1.27 trillion resistance level seen in March before aiming for the previous cycle‚Äôs $1.7 trillion all-time high. He anticipates a bullish continuation leading to a new market all-time high during the next phase.



Contrasting Signals



Despite these optimistic projections, the altcoin season index by Blockchain Center presents a contrasting view.¬†



According to this index:




‚ÄúIf 75% of the top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days), it is Altcoin Season.‚Äù¬†




Currently, only 37% of the leading 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the past 90 days, still insufficient to officially declare an altcoin season.



The cryptocurrency market stands at a critical juncture, with significant legislative decisions and market movements on the horizon.¬†



While many analysts are optimistic about the potential onset of a new altcoin season, contrasting indicators suggest investors should proceed with caution.¬†



The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the direction of the altcoin market, potentially leading to a ‚Äòmaniac phase‚Äô or continued consolidation.

Ripple CLO Advocates For Crypto, Cites US SEC Chairman's Inefficiency | Bitcoinist.com


								Stuart Alderoty, the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of Ripple Labs has taken a firm stand in support of the cryptocurrency landscape, scathing the Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler for his incompetence in overseeing crypto assets.
Ripple CLO Slams Gary Gensler
Today, May 22, Chris Brummer, a professor of Financial Technology at Agnes Williams Sesquicentennial noted that for the first time, the SEC has become a subject of presidential politics.
The SEC chairman Gary Gensler was called out by name by a presidential candidate, which came as a shock to the professor because this has never happened before. Another shocking development highlighted by Brummer was the US president‚Äôs Joe Biden threat to veto Congressional legislation regarding the SEC in advance.
The post read:
This is the first time the SEC has become a subject of presidential politics. I don‚Äôt recall ever a presidential candidate mentioning the Chair of the SEC by name.¬† I also don‚Äôt remember a sitting President threatening preemptively to veto Congressional legislation about the SEC.
Responding to the professor‚Äôs post, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple‚Äôs CLO, believes Gensler has overplayed his hand, which led to the development. Rather than promoting a balanced regulatory environment that fosters growth while safeguarding investors, Alderoty argues that Gensler‚Äôs approach mistakenly labels crypto innovation as the problem, as he thought it was an easy target.

According to the Ripple CLO, the regulatory watchdog‚Äôs chairman enjoys being the person whom everyone loved to despise. Furthermore, Alderoty draws attention to Gensler‚Äôs disdain for accountability to Congress, which is essential for efficient regulation.¬†
Given his status, the Ripple CLO noted that Gensler misunderstood the role of Congressional oversight in the cryptocurrency sector, believing that he was immune to congressional scrutiny. However, with all of that gone, the chairman is now a struggling political liability, suggesting that Gensler is responsible for several problems in the industry.
Alderoty has also addressed Gensler‚Äôs unauthorized overreach in the crypto industry. Following the vote against the SEC‚Äôs SAB 121 bulletin last week, the CLO stated that the event demonstrated an agreement between the Democrats and Republicans that the chairman‚Äôs unlawful crypto overreach will no longer be accepted.
Gensler Sees Heightened Criticism From Top Crypto Figures
Stuart Alderoty is not the only popular crypto figure who has slammed the SEC‚Äôs chairman‚Äôs inefficient regulation. On Tuesday, cryptocurrency market observer and Cinneamhain Ventures founder Adam Cochran also attacked Gary Gensler over his lack of clarity regarding Ethereum regulations.

Cochran strongly believes that Ethereum is not a security, unlike the SEC, which thinks the asset fails under the securities law. Thus, Cochran insisted that Gensler explain this in court, calling on Coinbase‚Äôs CLO Paul Grewal to make this demand.
This might imply that the founder believes that Gensler might be unable to defend his claims that ETH is a security, asserting that his collapse would be historic.

It is possible that the meme coin could even approach $1 in the future.

This anticipation has caused a surge in all Cryptocurrencies, especially Meme Coins.Additionally, the growing trend towards Meme tokens in the Crypto Market and the increasing buzz on social media are also playing a significant role in boosting Meme Coin prices.

Vitalik Buterin Transfers $300,000 in ETH as Countdown Continues for Potential Ethereum ETF Approval! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


With a possible Ethereum ETF approval just around the corner, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin transferred 80 ETH worth approximately $300,000 to privacy-focused coin mixer Railgun.
Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Transferred $300 Thousand ETH to Railgun
This transaction continues a pattern observed over the past six months, where Buterin has been regularly moving smaller amounts of ETH to Railgun each month.


Buterin has previously supported the use of Railgun, highlighting its effectiveness in preventing malicious behavior and protecting user privacy.

Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our¬†website policy¬†prior to making financial decisions.



Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI) reported its financial results for the fiscal second quarter of 2024, which ended on May 4, 2024, showcasing a robust performance despite challenging macroeconomic conditions. The company reported revenue of $2.16 billion, exceeding its outlook‚Äôs midpoint. This performance highlights the resilience of Analog Devices‚Äô business model, even amidst ongoing inventory headwinds. The operating cash flow for the quarter was a significant $4.3 billion, with free cash flow reaching $3.1 billion on a trailing twelve-month basis.



Analog Devices also returned over $675 million to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases during the second quarter. Vincent Roche, CEO and Chair of Analog Devices, emphasized the company‚Äôs ability to achieve profitability and earnings per share above the high end of their outlook. Roche noted that the stabilization of inventory rationalization across their broad customer base and improving new orders positions the company well for sequential growth in the upcoming quarters.



Analog Devices Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations with $1.40 Adj. EPS and $2.16 Billion in Revenue for Fiscal Q2



When comparing the actual performance to market expectations, Analog Devices surpassed revenue predictions but fell short on earnings per share (EPS). The market had anticipated an EPS of $1.26 and revenue of $2.1 billion. However, Analog Devices reported an EPS of $0.61, significantly lower than expected, while revenue came in at $2.16 billion, slightly above expectations.



Despite the lower-than-expected EPS, the company‚Äôs adjusted EPS was reported at $1.40, which is above the market expectation, indicating strong underlying performance when excluding certain one-time costs and adjustments. The gross margin for the quarter was 54.7%, down from 65.7% in the same quarter last year, reflecting the challenging operating environment. Adjusted gross margin stood at 66.7%, down from 73.7% year-over-year. These figures underscore the operational efficiencies and cost management strategies that Analog Devices has implemented to mitigate external pressures.





Analog Devices Expects Fiscal 2024 Revenue to Be Between $2.17 Billion and $2.27 Billion



Analog Devices provided optimistic guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The company forecasts revenue to be around $2.27 billion, plus or minus $100 million. At the midpoint of this revenue outlook, the company expects a reported operating margin of approximately 20.1%, with an adjusted operating margin of around 40.0%. This guidance reflects the company‚Äôs confidence in its ability to drive growth and profitability in the coming months.



Analog Devices also projected reported EPS to be $0.71, plus or minus $0.10, and adjusted EPS to be $1.50, plus or minus $0.10. This outlook is based on current expectations and takes into account the ongoing economic uncertainties and inventory dynamics.

Ethereum ETF Excitement Sparks Bitcoin and Altcoin Surge


							

Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin will surpass its $73,798 record this week.



The potential green light for an Ethereum ETF fuels optimism, driving Bitcoin‚Äôs price surge.



Ethereum and memecoins like Pepe and Floki are also experiencing significant gains amidst renewed bullish sentiment.




Geoff Kendrick, the Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, has predicted a new all-time high (ATH) for Bitcoin by the coming weekend. Kendrick noted in an interview that the flagship crypto would surpass the current $73,798 ATH, achieved on March 14, before the weekend is over.



Citing the potential approval of an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) this week, the research expert believes it would further legitimize the crypto sector, boosting Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption. He asserts that this week‚Äôs anticipated new high aligns with his $150,000 target for Bitcoin by year-end and a $200,000 target by December 2025.



Kendrick highlighted the renewed optimism among spot Bitcoin ETF investors, which has invigorated the ecosystem. This has led to increased inflows, bringing the total value to $12.9 billion at the time of the interview. Data from Soso Value shows this figure has since risen to $13.17 billion.



Bitcoin embarked on a significant rally following a recent notice by the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), requesting updates to 19b-4 filings for spot Ethereum. The SEC‚Äôs request signaled potential progress toward an Ethereum ETF approval. It also increased the chances of approval from 25% to 75% based on the crypto industry‚Äôs sentiments.









Beyond Bitcoin, many altcoins also rallied, signaling a resurgence of bullish sentiment. Pepe and Floki led the memecoin rally, outperforming other cryptocurrencies. Pepe spiked by 59% in the past 48 hours, while Floki gained 30%.



Most notably, Ethereum, the flagship altcoin, broke out of a 5-week range to rally 26% in the past 48 hours. With the surge, Ethereum climbed above multiple resistances, opening the way for retesting this year‚Äôs high of $4,093, which it established in March. ETH traded for $3,754 at the time of writing, having retraced slightly from yesterday‚Äôs $3,841 high, according to data from TradingView.

Breakneck Growth: Polygon (MATIC) Surpasses 4 Billion Transactions


								Polygon, the Ethereum scaling solution aiming to solve the network‚Äôs scalability woes, has blasted past a monumental milestone: 4 billion total transactions. This achievement is particularly impressive considering the network launched just four years ago in June 2020. Bitcoin, for comparison, took a staggering 15 years to reach 1 billion transactions, highlighting the breakneck speed of Polygon‚Äôs adoption.

User Surge Fuels Polygon‚Äôs Growth Engine
This meteoric rise isn‚Äôt just a vanity metric. The number of daily active users on the network paints a vibrant picture of a thriving ecosystem. Since March 19th, Polygon has boasted a streak of over 60 days with an average of over 1 million daily active users.


This surge in user activity is likely fueled by the popularity of decentralized applications (dApps) built on Polygon. Popular names like Matr1x, a mobile-first play-to-earn game, and Galxe, a burgeoning digital identity network, are attracting users and driving transaction volume.

However, despite this impressive network growth, the price of MATIC, Polygon‚Äôs native token, hasn‚Äôt mirrored the enthusiasm. Over the past year, MATIC has remained largely range-bound between $0.5 and $1, significantly underperforming the broader crypto market. This disconnect between network activity and token price has some scratching their heads.

Unpacking The MATIC Price Mystery
Analysts offer a few explanations for this price conundrum. As more users flock to Polygon‚Äôs dApps, the demand for MATIC, needed to interact with them, should rise in turn. This could lead to a long-term price appreciation for MATIC. However, others point to the sheer volume of tokens in circulation (over 10 billion) as a potential damper on price increases.

Another factor is the competition. While Polygon is the leading Ethereum scaling solution, other blockchains like Solana boast even higher transaction volumes (over 290 billion in a similar timeframe).

The Future Of Polygon: A Balancing Act
Despite the current price stagnation, experts remain cautiously optimistic about Polygon‚Äôs future. The network‚Äôs rapid growth and user adoption are undeniable positives. The team behind Polygon is also actively working on scaling solutions and attracting new dApps to its ecosystem.
If they can successfully navigate the competitive landscape and translate network activity into real value for users, MATIC could finally escape its downward trend and embark on a sustained journey upwards.

Oracle Protocols: Bridging the Gap Between Blockchain and the Real World - Coin Edition


							

Oracle protocols bridge the gap between blockchain and real-world data, enhancing the functionality of decentralized applications.



Flare Network integrates Oracle capabilities directly into its blockchain, providing a robust environment for advanced smart contracts.



Arthur Hayes highlights the competition among leading oracle protocols, noting Flare‚Äôs potential to revolutionize the industry.




Blockchain technology, known for its decentralized nature, thrives on accurate and reliable data. However, to fully leverage its potential, blockchain applications require information from the real world‚Äîdata typically not available on the blockchain itself. Oracle protocols provide a solution to this challenge, acting as the critical link between off-chain and on-chain data.



What Are Oracle Protocols?



Oracle protocols are specialized software systems that serve as intermediaries between blockchain networks and external data sources. They enable blockchain applications to utilize real-world data, which is essential for decentralized applications (dApps) to operate effectively. Without oracles, blockchains would remain isolated and unable to access external information necessary for various applications.



Oracles retrieve, verify, and transmit data from outside sources to the blockchain securely and reliably. This process is crucial for smart contracts, which depend on accurate and timely data to function correctly. For example, oracles can provide real-time price feeds from traditional markets to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, enabling services like lending, borrowing, and trading based on up-to-date market data.



Furthermore, Oracle Protocols empower dApps to make informed decisions based on real-world events. Whether tracking the condition of goods in a supply chain, determining the outcome of a sports event for a betting platform, or triggering an insurance policy based on weather conditions, oracles connect blockchain technology with real-world data, enhancing the practical application and effectiveness of dApps.



How Oracles Link On-Chain and Off-Chain Data



Oracles facilitate a seamless flow of information between blockchain environments and external data sources. The process begins with an off-chain source, such as a web API, database, or sensor in a connected device. The oracle retrieves this data and verifies its accuracy and reliability through multiple stages to minimize the risk of manipulation or errors.



In decentralized oracle networks like Chainlink, this verification process involves collecting and cross-checking the same data from multiple nodes. These nodes compare their results and reach a consensus before the verified data is transmitted to the blockchain. Financial incentives, such as staking and rewards schemes, align node operators‚Äô interests with the accuracy of the data they provide.









The confirmed data is then relayed to the blockchain, where it can be used by smart contracts and other dApps. This relay process often includes additional security measures to ensure the data remains untampered. Cryptographic methods can secure the data during transmission, and time-stamping techniques ensure the data is current and relevant.



Accuracy and data integrity are paramount in this process. The reliability of smart contracts and dApps depends on the correctness of the data they use. Incorrect or outdated information from an oracle can lead to erroneous contract executions, financial losses, or other unintended outcomes. Therefore, oracles employ rigorous methods to retrieve, verify, and transmit data, ensuring blockchain applications operate as intended and make sound decisions based on the most accurate data.



How Flare Network Uses Oracle Technology



Flare Network is a protocol that integrates smart contract technology with Oracle capabilities. Unlike traditional oracles that provide data to blockchains, Flare incorporates these features directly into its blockchain architecture. This integration creates a robust environment for building and managing smart contracts with reliable data.



Flare‚Äôs approach involves validators within its network who are responsible for obtaining and verifying external data, ensuring network integrity, and earning rewards for their contributions. Key components of Flare include the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) and the Data Connector. The Data Connector allows Flare to access data from various external sources, including other blockchains and online services, while the FTSO handles time-sensitive data, which is crucial for applications needing real-time information.



By offering these integrated features, Flare facilitates the development of advanced and versatile smart contracts. The network‚Äôs ability to gather and process data streams from multiple sources ensures the accuracy and timeliness of the information available, promoting the creation of applications that depend on precise and up-to-date data without additional costs.



Insights from Arthur Hayes



Arthur Hayes, in his article ‚ÄúIgniting the Oracle Wars: Keep an Eye on Flare,‚Äù discusses the competition among leading oracle protocols‚ÄîChainlink, Pyth, and Flare. As blockchain applications grow more complex, the importance of oracles increases, making this competition critical.



Chainlink, the industry leader, benefits from a robust network and extensive integrations. However, it faces challenges with speed and managing large data volumes, as well as centralized price feed management. Pyth excels in providing rapid, precise price updates, particularly useful for financial applications.



Flare combines the strengths of both Chainlink and Pyth, offering unique features like the Data Connector and FTSO. This integration directly links Oracle services with its smart contract platform, allowing Flare to generate revenue from both data services and smart contracts. Hayes predicts that the protocol that best handles future challenges, such as managing large datasets for AI applications, will dominate the ‚ÄúOracle Wars.‚Äù Although Chainlink currently leads, Flare‚Äôs innovative approach and expanding ecosystem position it as a formidable competitor.



Conclusion



Oracle protocols are essential in the blockchain ecosystem. They enable smart contracts to utilize real-world data, thus enhancing the flexibility and utility of decentralized applications. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, Oracles will play a crucial role in supporting more sophisticated and diverse applications. Keeping abreast of advancements in Oracle technology is vital, especially with emerging protocols like Flare that have the potential to transform the industry and drive new innovations.

Ethereum ETF Launch Potentially Still Weeks Away, Says Bloomberg Analyst - Benzinga

Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on Monday pointed out that the listing of spot Ethereum ETFs could be weeks or even longer away, despite recent developments.What Haeppened: At least five potential spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETF issuers, including Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares and Franklin, have filed their amended 19b-4s through CBOE.These amendments primarily involve the removal of staking-related content, emphasizing that the Fund‚Äôs ETH cannot be staked by anyone.In his tweet, Seyffart stated, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs happening. We have at least 5 of the potential Ethereum ETF issuers that have submitted their Amended 19b-4‚Äôs in the last ~25 min. Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares, & Franklin all submitted via CBOE.‚ÄùDespite these submissions, Seyffart noted that the launch of these ETFs might still be a long way off. ‚ÄúStill a potentially long way from a launch. But these filings prove that all of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate. Need to actually see SEC approval orders on all the 19b-4s AND THEN we need to see S-1 approvals. Could be weeks or more before ETFs launch,‚Äù he explained.The only substantial change identified in the revised filings was the removal of staking language. Seyffart said, ‚ÄúThis is the only meaningful & substantial change that I can find? Removing the staking language and adding very clear language that the Fund‚Äôs ETH cannot be staked by anyone.‚ÄùDespite these modifications, the approval odds remain at 75%, as highlighted by Seyffart, though he added, ‚ÄúNot that it even means anything anymore haha.‚ÄùAlso Read: EXCLUSIVE: Ethereum ETFs Could Drive ‚ÄòMass Adoption‚Äô ‚Äî What Investors Need To Know NowAdding to the complexity, Scott Johnsson of Van Buren Capital highlighted the extensive review process the SEC typically undertakes. He explained that the SEC‚Äôs review of BTC spot and futures S-1s took several months, suggesting a similar timeline could apply here.Johnsson said, ‚ÄúSEC spent nearly 4 months reviewing and iterating BTC spot S-1s and 5 months reviewing BTC futures S-1s. If Division of Corporation Finance indeed was told about this potential approval yesterday, then they‚Äôre likely just getting started. Nothing about this situation is straightforward, so difficult to know how quickly they try to push forward this process.‚ÄùWhat‚Äôs Next: The implications of these developments and other regulatory trends in the digital asset space will be further explored at Benzinga‚Äôs Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.This event will bring together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to discuss the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape.Read Next: SEC Could Approve Spot Ethereum ETF ‚ÄòThis Week:‚Äô ReportImage: Shutterstock

WisdomTree's Bitcoin, Ethereum ETPs to debut on London Stock Exchange next week - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            WisdomTree, a global exchange-traded fund (ETF) and exchange-traded product (ETP) sponsor, has secured the Financial Conduct Authority‚Äôs (FCA) approval to list its WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin and WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETPs on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), according to a press release published today. The listing, expected to occur on May 28, will initially cater exclusively to professional investors.As previously reported by Crypto Briefing, May 28 is also expected to be the debut date of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded notes (ETNs) on the LSE.This move positions WisdomTree among the first to receive FCA endorsement for a crypto ETP prospectus. Institutions in Europe can now gain exposure to crypto backed by Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively, via these ETPs.With a Total Expense Ratio (TER) of just 0.35%, WisdomTree‚Äôs upcoming crypto ETPs are among the most cost-efficient options for investors in the region.Commenting on the latest development, Alexis Marinof, Head of Europe at WisdomTree, said the FCA approval not only facilitates easier access for UK investors but also removes the regulatory hurdles that previously discouraged investors from entering the market.‚ÄúWhile UK-based professional investors have been able to allocate to crypto ETPs via overseas exchanges, they will soon have a more convenient access point,‚Äù Marinof stated.‚ÄúFCA approval in this respect could result in greater institutional adoption of the asset class, as many professional investors have been unable to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to regulatory limitations and uncertainty ‚Äì we would expect FCA approval of our crypto ETPs‚Äô prospectus to remove those barriers to entry,‚Äù he added.WisdomTree‚Äôs commitment to providing secure, regulated investment vehicles for crypto assets began in 2019 with the launch of the WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin ETP.The firm has since expanded its offerings to encompass a suite of eight physically backed crypto ETPs. These ETPs provide exposure to both individual cryptocurrencies and diversified baskets, and are available for trading on multiple European exchanges.In March this year, WisdomTree announced it secured the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval to operate as a New York limited-purpose trust company charter. This development allows WisdomTree to offer fiduciary custody of digital assets, issue DFS-approved stablecoins, and manage stablecoin reserves.[Update with context in the second paragraph]

GameStop Price Crashes, Buy The Dip Or Sell GME? This Solana Meme Coin ICO Raises / Cryptonews
                        Just over one week on from legendary GameStop investor Roaring Kitty‚Äôs abrupt return to social media for the first time since 2021, the GameStop (GME) price has crashed, with retail investors asking whether now might be the time to buy the dip or sell GME.The GameStop price rallied as high as $65 last Tuesday but has since crashed back to $22.That leaves it barely 20% above its levels from before Roaring Kitty‚Äôs return.Roaring Kitty was a leading figure in the 2021 meme stock craze, during which time GME was a leading stock.The 2021 meme stock craze was viewed by many as a retail investor-led movement against Wall Street hegemony.Hopes remain high amongst retail investors that Roaring Kitty‚Äôs return could catalyze a new meme stock season.US Presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy even announced on Monday that he had invested $24,000 in GME.But macro conditions likely don‚Äôt warrant a repeat of 2021 meme stock mania.The US government isn‚Äôt currently handing out stimulus cheques.And while US equity markets are pushing on to new record highs, interest rates remain at multi-decade highs.Recent years of inflation plus high interest rates have put a major squeeze on retail investor spending firepower.Also, there is good reason to be bearish on the GameStop price. GME is an inflationary asset ‚Äì the company last week announced a new stock sale.Meanwhile, the company continues to run at a loss and cut jobs as it struggles with e-commerce competitors.GME Investors Should Instead Consider Meme Coins 
Traders looking to make speculative bets on assets that could see huge market hype-driven gains can do better than GME.As noted above, the outlook for the GameStop price isn‚Äôt necessarily good as it has bad fundamentals and is inflationary.Its also got a bloated market cap of around $6.5 billion.For a company that probably isn‚Äôt worth anything in real life, that‚Äôs potentially a very large overvaluation.And that reduces the likelihood of anything more than 5x gains this bull cycle.Traders considering GME should instead consider crypto meme coins.Top meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe are likely to continue to grow as crypto technology is adopted.However, their bloated market caps suggest that they also have limited room for upside.Luckily, new meme coins are popping up every day. While most are scams or pump-and-dumps, savvy traders may be able to uncover hidden 100x gems.One such coin that analysts at Cryptonews are very bullish on is Solana meme coin ICO Sealana (SEAL).Sealana (SEAL) ‚Äì The Best Solana Meme Coin ICO Right Now
South Park-themed Seal cartoon character Sealana has been generating huge excitement since launching its presale.The new¬†Solana meme coin¬†ICO features an overweight, Solana meme coin trading degen seal called¬†Sealana.The loveable seal mascot has already attracted over $2.35 million in funds from early investors.Strong demand is no surprise given the strong traction Sealana has been getting across socials.Sealana has already garnered over 5,000¬†X¬†followers, as well as over 5,000 on¬†Telegram.Sealana‚Äôs marketing and presale success is reminiscent of the recently launched Solana meme coin Slothana (SLOTH).Slothana raised over $15 million in a similar presale. However, it then went on to pump to a market cap of over $100 million, as per¬†DEXTools.Presale investors were up over 5x within just a few days of the token‚Äôs launch. That more than could likely be expected from the GameStop price in the near future.SLOTH also just launched on the top-ten crypto exchange HTX. This could lead to a new push higher in its price as new retail investors flood in.Amid rumors that the Slothana and Sealana teams are related, traders will hope SEAL‚Äôs success matches SLOTH‚Äôs.If Sealana can quickly secure exchange listings post-launch like SLOTH, it could easily be the¬†best new Solana meme coin¬†ICO to buy right now.Investors can buy their SEAL by connecting their web3 wallet on¬†Sealana‚Äôs official website¬†with SOL, ETH, USDT, or USDC. Sealana is also available for purchase via card.Buy Sealana Here

Bitcoin Price Alert: 273,000 BTC Held at Key Bitcoin Supply Range

As Bitcoin teeters near $70,000, analysts are closely watching a critical supply zone for the largest cryptocurrency. This range is crucial because it represents a key area where a substantial amount of Bitcoin was acquired.Crypto analyst Ali has identified a key supply zone for Bitcoin, situated between $70,180 and $70,600, where over 450,000 addresses have collectively acquired approximately 273,000 BTC.¬† The supply zone is an important area on the price chart that often acts as a barrier to upward price movements. It is where a large number of Bitcoin was previously bought, and holders may look to break even or take profits, potentially leading to increased selling pressure.¬†Following a steady rebound from May 1 lows of $56,500, Bitcoin reached highs of $71,980 on May 21 before encountering resistance. At the time of writing, BTC was sustaining its declines from the prior day, down 1.91% in the last 24 hours to $69,998.¬†Potential scenariosAs Bitcoin approaches the highlighted critical supply zone, several scenarios could unfold:If Bitcoin manages to break above the $70,600 level with strong volume, it could signal a continuation of the bullish trend. This would likely attract additional buyers, pushing the price higher and potentially establishing a new support level.On the other hand, if Bitcoin faces significant selling pressure within this range, it could lead to a price rejection and subsequent pullback. This scenario would indicate that many holders want to realize profits, resulting in temporary resistance.Another possibility is that Bitcoin consolidates below this range for a while. This would imply a balance between buyers and sellers ahead of a major price movement.As Bitcoin considers its next move, price behavior around the $70,000 mark would be closely watched given the sheer volume of BTC accumulated in this area.¬†Based on the MVRV Pricing Bands, Ali believes that if Bitcoin continues to trade above $65,125, the next local BTC peak before a temporary drop around $77,593.

Ethereum Spot ETFs: When Will They Begin Trading In The Event Of An SEC Approval? | Bitcoinist.com


								Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has provided insights into when the Spot Ethereum ETFs could begin trading if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were to approve these funds. Based on his remarks, it could take weeks to months before these funds launch, even if an approval would come this week.¬†
S-1 Filings Need To Be Approved Before Trading Can Commence¬†
Seyffart mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the S-1 approvals are needed before the Spot Ethereum ETFs can go live and that it could take ‚Äúweeks to months‚Äù for this approval to come in. He made this statement while clarifying that their 75% approval odds only related to the deadline for the 19b-4 filings, with VanEck‚Äôs and Ark 21Shares‚Äô final deadline coming up on May 23 and 24, respectively.¬†

Seyffart and his colleague Eric Balchunas predict that the SEC will likely approve at least VanEck‚Äôs application on or before May 23 since this is the final deadline for the Commission to decide on it. Before now, the SEC was expected to deny these applications, mainly because there were reports that it considered Ethereum a security.¬†
However, Balchunas revealed in an X post that the Commission had become willing to approve these funds due to an ‚Äúincreasingly political issue.‚Äù The SEC has already shown a willingness to approve these funds, having informed Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to update their filings.
Insiders have also claimed that the SEC‚Äôs feedback to these exchanges is a positive signal and shows that the regulator might be ready to approve these investment funds. Steven McClurg, the head of US asset management for CoinShares, also told Reuters that it could take months for the Ethereum ETFs to begin trading since, unlike the exchange filings, there is no set timeframe for the SEC to approve the registration filings.¬†¬†
However, the SEC has shown that it can approve both the 19b-4 and S-1 filings simultaneously, just like it did with the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which immediately went live thanks to this. The only difference between then and now is that the SEC constantly communicated with the issuers weeks before the Bitcoin ETFs were approved.¬†
Fidelity And Grayscale Remove Staking Plans From Ethereum Spot ETFs
Asset managers Fidelity and Grayscale have removed their staking plans in their updated S1-filings. This was expected, considering that the staking feature is a huge part of why the SEC is rumored to consider ETH a security. However, removing this staking offering again suggests that the SEC will approve these funds as long as ETH staking isn‚Äôt included.¬†

Meanwhile, Seyffart noted in an X post that their approval odds still stand at 75% since the removal of the staking plans was expected.¬†¬†
At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,700, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.¬†

Crypto Analyst Alex Kr√ºger Revises Ethereum Outlook Amid SEC Rumors | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 21 May 2024, prominent macroeconomist and crypto analyst Alex Kr√ºger provided new insights on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) regarding the potential for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve spot Ethereum ETFs. Kr√ºger, who founded the asset management and advisory firm Aike Capital, offered a detailed analysis reflecting the rapidly changing sentiment in the cryptocurrency market.



Until this week, Kr√ºger had been pessimistic about the likelihood of the SEC approving any spot Ethereum ETFs this year or soon. However, recent developments have prompted a reevaluation. On 20 May 2024, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart significantly increased their estimated odds of SEC approval for spot ETH ETFs from 25% to 75%. This adjustment was based on emerging rumors suggesting that the SEC might be reconsidering its stance, driven by political considerations.



Balchunas shared the updated odds on X, noting that the shift was fueled by afternoon chatter indicating a possible reversal in the SEC‚Äôs approach to this increasingly politicized issue. This unexpected development has caused market participants to scramble to adjust their positions, many of whom had previously assumed that ETF approvals would be denied.







In his analysis, Kr√ºger acknowledged the potential impact of these rumors. He stated that his base case scenario had been:



Bitcoin rising significantly by the end of the year.Ethereum underperforming due to the expected rejection of spot ETH ETF proposals by the SEC.Ethereum outperforming post the U.S. presidential elections in November 2024, driven by a potential change in SEC leadership and subsequent approval of spot ETH ETFs in 2025.



However, the possibility of an SEC approval, possibly as early as this week, could accelerate these timelines. Kr√ºger emphasized that the market had not fully priced in such an approval, suggesting that Ethereum could see a substantial rally if the approval were granted.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Kr√ºger explained that the current market movements were primarily driven by repositioning and the closing of short positions, as the possibility of an SEC approval caught many off guard. He predicted that if approval were granted, it would lead to significant inflows into Ethereum, potentially pushing its price to all-time highs (ATHs).



He cautioned against underestimating the potential for approval, highlighting that such a decision could reinvigorate bullish sentiment and cause Ethereum to lead the market. Despite the day‚Äôs rally, he pointed out that ETH/BTC was still down year-to-date, indicating room for further growth.







Kr√ºger also touched on the political dynamics influencing the SEC‚Äôs stance. He suggested that the seeming shift in the SEC‚Äôs approach might be politically driven, possibly influenced by the upcoming elections and the need to counteract former President Donald Trump‚Äôs recent pro-crypto stance.



He noted that if the SEC rejects the spot ETH ETF proposals, which he now views as unlikely, the market could experience significant pain. He advised traders to stay alert and monitor developments closely until the SEC‚Äôs decision on May 23rd.







Kr√ºger also delvec into the political dynamics influencing the SEC‚Äôs stance. He posits that the seeming change in the SEC‚Äôs approach may be driven by top Democratic party members, potentially influenced by the upcoming elections. He believes this shift could be a reaction to former President Donald Trump‚Äôs recent support for cryptocurrency, forcing a strategic move from the Democrats to not appear anti-crypto.

                        The Bonk price has risen by almost 1% today, reaching $0.00003187 as the wider crypto market drops by 0.5% in the past 24 hours.BONK is now up by 31% in a week and by 54% in a month, with the Solana-based meme token also up by a whopping 7,900% in a year.And these gains come at a time when prominent trader TheCryptoDog has suggested that attention is turning to BONK, presaging a possible rally in the near future.Bonk Price Prediction as Millionaire Trader TheCryptoDog Says BONK is About to Rally ‚Äì Time to Buy?
Bonk is showing some signs of a minor correction after the surging of the past couple of days, with its indicators reflecting a dip in momentum.In particular, its RSI (purple) has declined from 85 on Sunday/Monday almost 50 today, with the coin having plenty of room to slip further before becoming decidedly oversold.Source: TradingViewHaving said that, its other indicators don‚Äôt seem too bad, with its 30-day average (orange) still rising steadily beyond the 200-day average (blue), even if it isn‚Äôt rising quite as steeply today.What‚Äôs particularly positive is that BONK‚Äôs volume remains high at just over $800 million, up from $180 million only a few days ago.Also bullish are BONK‚Äôs resistance (red) and support (green) levels, which are both rising in parallel, suggesting that the coin will trade within a consistently rising band.Much of the coin‚Äôs increased volume has come from renewed interest from whales, as recent data indicates.Such interest could continue for a while yet, with the wider market looking as though it‚Äôs entering a new bull phase.This is largely because the SEC looks ready to approve several spot-based Ethereum ETFs, with the deadline for a batch coming tomorrow.While any approval will not directly affect BONK, it will at least boost market-wide bullishness, thereby helping the Bonk price.And for some traders, BONK looks likelier than many other meme tokens to rally in the very near future.This is the opinion of TheCryptoDog, for instance, who has recently posted on X that the coin seems to be attracting more interest than many of its rivals.As such, we may see the Bonk price reach $0.000035 in the next few weeks, before potentially returning to its ATH of $0.00004547 by Q4.New Meme Tokens Could Bring Bigger Rallies
Bonk does look ready to surge in the near future, yet it‚Äôs not the only Solana-based meme token with good potential right now.There are also a range of presale tokens that are gaining hype and momentum, with some of these likely to perform very well once they list.A prime candidate is Sealana (SEAL), a new meme coin that has raised just over $2.3 million in its increasingly popular sale.Aiming to follow in the footsteps of BONK, WIF and other out-performing Solana-based meme coins, SEAL is already attracting a sizeable following online.This is partly thanks to its meme stylings, with the token adopting a gun-toting yet amiable seal as its anthropomorphic mascot.One interesting feature of Sealana is that it will actually be a multi-chain meme coin, with an Ethereum version of the token already live.Given the early success of its presale, it‚Äôs likely to enjoy a big listing once it launches in the next few weeks.In the meantime, investors can still buy it via its presale by going to the official Sealana website.It‚Äôs available at a conversion rate 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which is roughly worth $0.026 per token.VIDEOIt may quickly supersede such a price once it goes live, potentially turning itself into a rival of BONK and other SOL-based coins.Buy SEAL Today

Kangamoon presale nears 7M as Uniswap (UNI) price jumps on response to SEC's Wells Notice - CoinJournal



                    

                    
The robust rebuttal from Uniswap against the SEC‚Äôs allegations has sent shockwaves through the crypto market.
The price of Uniswap (UNI) surged to a high of $9.67 following the news of the tough response.
As UNI price rises, another new altcoin Kangamoon (KANG) is also making waves as its presale nears $7M.

The Uniswap (UNI) price is soaring following Uniswap Labs‚Äô formidable response to the SEC‚Äôs Wells Notice. Although the token has slightly pulled back, it surged by more than 30% immediately after the news of the response broke.
The response has not only bolstered investor confidence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector but also ignited positive sentiment for other altcoins, notably Kangamoon (KANG), which is currently in the midst of its presale.
The 40-page response to SEC‚Äôs Wells Notice
Uniswap Labs filed a comprehensive 40-page response to the SEC‚Äôs Wells Notice, vehemently contesting the agency‚Äôs claims that Uniswap‚Äôs operations may violate US securities laws.
The decentralized crypto exchange argued against potential lawsuits, urging the SEC to reconsider its stance. Uniswap refuted the SEC‚Äôs assertions, labeling them as ‚Äúweak‚Äù and citing court rulings that contradicted the agency‚Äôs legal arguments.
Moreover, Uniswap challenged the SEC‚Äôs expansive interpretation of securities laws, emphasizing that the agency‚Äôs allegations were based on unreasonable extensions of key definitions such as securities, exchanges, and contracts.
The platform also highlighted that the majority of its trading volume did not involve securities, as per the SEC‚Äôs own standards, and that most of its users were from outside the US, potentially exempting them from US securities laws.
The new meme coin making waves alongside Uniswap (UNI)
As Uniswap continues its legal battle with the SEC, another project, Kangamoon, is making waves in the crypto space with its unique approach to meme coins and community engagement.
Kangamoon aims to establish itself as a prominent meme coin while integrating elements of SocialFi and Play To Earn (P2E).
The project promises an immersive gaming experience where players can earn rewards in the form of $KANG tokens and exclusive NFTs by participating in challenges and competitions.
Currently in its presale phase, Kangamoon has already raised a significant amount of nearing the $7 million mark.
Notably, the presale offers early investors an opportunity to acquire $KANG tokens at a favorable price before the official launch of the platform. It has garnered attention from investors and enthusiasts alike, drawn to its innovative concept and potential for community-driven growth.
Participants in the Kangamoon presale can look forward to claiming their tokens once the presale concludes.
The project‚Äôs team has assured that detailed instructions for token claiming will be provided through various channels, including the official website, social media platforms, newsletters, and Telegram.
Conclusion
The surge in Uniswap (UNI) price following Uniswap Labs‚Äô response to the SEC‚Äôs Wells Notice has injected optimism into the cryptocurrency market, benefiting projects like Kangamoon whose presale is underway.
As both crypto projects navigate regulatory challenges and strive for success, they exemplify the resilience and innovation inherent in the crypto space.

DOT Explodes Above $7.5 but Watch This Metric Closely: Polkadot Price Analysis


																Polkadot has recently witnessed a surge in demand, leading to a price uptick that has breached its previous swing high and broken through a multi-month descending trendline. The price is now approaching the upper boundary of its consolidation range and is on the brink of surpassing it.
Technical Analysis
By Shayan
The Daily Chart
A detailed analysis of Polkadot‚Äôs daily chart shows that after a prolonged phase of sideways consolidation, a renewed spike in demand has pushed the price higher. This surge has allowed Polkadot to break through several key resistance levels, including a descending multi-month trendline, the prior swing high of $7.47, and the 200-day moving average.
Now, the price is approaching the upper boundary of this long-standing range and is on the verge of breaking above it.
If the buyers manage to push above this range, it could signal the beginning of a sustained bullish trend. However, if selling pressure intensifies, a bearish reversal towards the lower boundary is possible. The price action around this crucial resistance zone will determine Polkadot‚Äôs short-term trajectory.
Source: TradingView
The 4-Hour Chart
In the 4-hour timeframe, Polkadot‚Äôs recent bullish momentum is more evident, with the price experiencing a 12% impulsive spike towards a significant resistance area.
This critical range is bounded by the 0.5 ($7.415) and the 0.618 ($7.821) Fibonacci levels. Nevertheless, the price has been fluctuating within an ascending wedge pattern for an extended period, and following the recent surge in demand, it is now slightly retracing towards its upper boundary.
If the buyers can breach the substantial resistance at $7.8, the next target will be the upper boundary of the wedge in the mid-term.
Conversely, a bearish reversal could lead to another downward move, aiming for the wedge‚Äôs lower boundary. A decisive breakout from the wedge pattern is necessary to determine Polkadot‚Äôs upcoming direction.
Source: TradingView
Sentiment Analysis
By Shayan
Polkadot‚Äôs price has recently experienced a notable surge, raising expectations of a potential mid-term bullish trend. Hence, analyzing the futures market sentiment is crucial to assess whether this uptrend will persist, as futures market positions are significant drivers of volatility.
This chart illustrates the funding rate and open interest metrics alongside Polkadot‚Äôs daily price movements. Despite the recent bullish surge, both open interest and funding rates have not shown a significant increase and remain near their lowest levels. This suggests that the recent price action was not driven by increased bullish activity in the perpetual markets.
While Polkadot‚Äôs price has surged, the sustainability of this uptrend depends on the futures market sentiment. If open interest and funding rates begin to rise, it will signal strong bullish momentum, potentially solidifying the uptrend. Conversely, if these metrics remain low, the uptrend may lack the necessary support for long-term continuation. Traders should closely watch these indicators to better understand the market‚Äôs direction in the coming weeks.

AI predicts XRP price for August 1, 2024


    With many assets in the cryptocurrency sector starting to stagnate after recent bullish price action, the same is happening to XRP, but artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms predict further improvements for this crypto asset in the following several months.



As it happens, XRP has halted its bullish advances from the previous days and has dropped back below the previously surpassed critical price level at $0.53, demonstrating the beginning of a consolidation noticeable in other assets in the crypto market as well.



XRP price prediction



Specifically, one of the popular AI algorithms, which takes into account historical XRP price movements, technical analysis (TA) indicators, chart patterns, and other relevant factors, has set the price of XRP on August 1, 2024, at $0.384764, which would suggest a drop of¬†27.29% from its current price.

Elsewhere, the newest model of the OpenAI invention ChatGPT, called GPT-4o, has set the price of XRP for August 1, 2024, in the range of $1.24 ‚Äì $3.30, taking into account both ‚Äúmedian expert expectations [and] bullish predictions and favorable legal outcomes,‚Äù as well as supply, demand, and market dynamics.¬†



Additionally, the recent Anthropic AI model, Claude 3 Opus, has offered the XRP price prediction in the range of $0.838 ‚Äì $2.23 by August 2024, considering ‚Äúmarket dynamics, regulatory developments, and the outcome of Ripple‚Äôs legal case‚Äù with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Notably, it has also explained that Ripple‚Äôs strategic partnerships could positively affect the acceptance of XRP and, with it, the token‚Äôs price action:




‚ÄúRipple has established partnerships with numerous banks and financial institutions, indicating growing adoption and integration of XRP into mainstream financial systems.‚Äù




XRP price analysis



Currently, XRP is changing hands at $0.52919, suggesting a decline of 2.19% in the last 24 hours but still recording an increase of 4.24% across the previous seven days and yet accumulating a drop of 1.08% on its monthly chart, as per data on May 22.

Earlier, crypto analyst Maximus Prime observed that XRP recently encountered rejection at the symmetrical trendline, a critical resistance level, stressing that XRP will have to ‚Äúfight its way back into it and hold above,‚Äù adding that the two-week chart presented a bearish outlook but that bulls were still trying.







At the same time, EGRAG Crypto highlighted that XRP was showing ‚Äúinclining steps to the upside‚Äù ‚Äì a bullish sign visible ‚Äúeven if you‚Äôre not a chart analyst‚Äù ‚Äì and a ‚Äúsolid trajectory‚Äù with the next pivotal target at $0.75, projecting consolidation followed by a pump and ‚Äúthe grand finale‚Äù in an X post on May 21.

All things considered, AI and experts‚Äô bullish XRP predictions might be correct, but doing one‚Äôs own research, weighing the risks, and keeping up with any relevant XRP news and Ripple news is critical before investing a significant amount of money in this token, as trends can change.

SEC's tough stance on crypto continues: Gary Gensler slams 'FIT 21' Act - AMBCrypto



Gary Gensler has opposed the ‚ÄúFIT 21‚Äù Act, citing regulatory gaps and risks to investors.
SEC‚Äôs crypto stance before the 2024 elections could majorly sway voter sentiment.

As former President Donald Trump starts accepting crypto donations for his 2024 presidential campaign, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has voiced his opposition against the crypto market bill.

In a statement released on the 22nd of May, Chair Gary Gensler publicly voiced his opposition to the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (‚ÄúFIT 21‚Äù Act).
The FIT 21 Act is a U.S. legislation aimed at promoting the development of new financial instruments and technologies while establishing a framework for their regulation and oversight.
Gensler stated,
‚ÄúFinancial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (‚ÄúFIT 21‚Äù) would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.‚Äù
He further added,
‚ÄúThe bill allows issuers of crypto investment contracts to self-certify that their products are a ‚Äòdecentralized‚Äô system and then be deemed a special class of ‚Äòdigital commodities‚Äô and thus not subject to SEC oversight.‚Äù
Such a strong stance by the SEC Chair ahead of the 2024 presidential election has sent shockwaves throughout the crypto community.
Crypto enthusiasts unhappy¬†

Echoing a similar line of thought, Ripple‚Äôs CLO, Stuart Alderoty, said,
‚ÄúGensler overplayed his hand. He thought crypto was an easy target. He relished being the guy that everyone loved to hate.‚Äù
He further went on and opined,
‚ÄúHe thought he was above Congressional oversight. That‚Äôs all gone. He‚Äôs now a struggling political liability.‚Äù
In a separate earlier interview, SEC Chair Gary Gensler voiced his frustration over the ‚Äúoutsized ratio‚Äù of crypto-related inquiries compared to those about traditional finance.
‚ÄúCrypto is a small piece of our overall markets. But, it‚Äôs an outsized piece of the scams and frauds and problems in the markets.‚Äù
Impact on the upcoming elections¬†
These developments might have a significant impact on President Joe Biden‚Äôs position in the upcoming election.
His administration‚Äôs cautious stance on cryptocurrency, as reflected in Chair Gensler‚Äôs regulatory approach, contrasts sharply with Donald Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto moves.
Hence, the difference in their approaches may sway voters, especially those supportive of cryptocurrencies.

Probe finds Effective Ventures charity acted ‚Äòdiligently‚Äô after FTX collapse


A UK government inquiry into an FTX-backed charity that received $26.8 million in donations, has concluded that its trustees acted ‚Äòquickly‚Äô and ‚Äòdiligently‚Äô protecting the charity‚Äôs funds in the wake of the crypto exchange‚Äôs high-profile collapse. 
In 2022, Effective Ventures Foundation (EV) filed a Serious Incident Report with the Charity Commission, informing it that FTX, one of the charity‚Äôs major funders, had filed for bankruptcy amid reports of criminal activity. It also informed the commission that the CEO of FTX Foundation and an unpaid advisor to the FTX Future Fund made up two of EV‚Äôs trustees.
The commission subsequently launched a probe to determine ‚Äòthe extent of any risk to the charity‚Äôs assets and the extent to which the trustees were complying with their legal duties‚Äô and to investigate ‚Äòthe governance and administration of the charity by the trustees, including relationships between the charity‚Äôs trustees and its funders and the identification and management of conflicts of interest.‚Äô
The investigation, which concluded with the publication of the commission‚Äôs report, revealed that EV trustees effectively ‚Äòringfenced‚Äô its FTX funding of ¬£3.3 million and $300,000 by informing the National Crime Agency that its FTX donated funds may be criminal as to avoid any money laundering offenses.¬†
The UK and US arms of EV also agreed to pay FTX a total of $26.8 million in 2022. The charity recently also listed for sale Wytham Abbey, the manor house that it bought with a ¬£17 million ($21.5 million) grant in 2021.
EV bought the 15th-century manor using a ¬£17 million grant unrelated to FTX.

The report also found that the charity excluded the two FTX-linked trustees from any decisions and discussions relating to the FTX bankruptcy, labeling them ‚Äònon-participating‚Äô trustees. The inquiry noted that there was a ‚Äòlack of clarity‚Äô around whether the FTX-linked trustees were acting for the charity or on behalf of FTX Foundation at any given time.
It stressed, however, that there was ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù to suggest any unmanaged conflicts of interest or that the FTX-linked trustees acted against EV‚Äôs interests. The two reportedly resigned during the inquiry.¬†
The inquiry concluded, ‚ÄúTrustees acted diligently and quickly in assessing the risk to the charity and installed measures to protect their assets and continued operations.‚Äù It added that despite ‚Äúhighlighted weaknesses within the charity and its governance the trustees sought to put these things right at the earliest opportunity.‚Äù

Trump Accepting Crypto Donations In The US Election


                                Donald Trump's Strategic Move In the US Election                                What‚Äôs The NewsAll the candidates are putting in maximum effort for their campaigns for the US presidential election to be held in November. Current president and Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden is using safety and work record as his main tools in his campaign to secure victory.¬†Meanwhile, potential Republican candidate Donald Trump has made a bold move by announcing that he will accept cryptocurrency donations for his election campaign thereby changing the entire direction of the US election.¬†According to information collected by CoinGabbar, a notice was issued yesterday stating that the Trump 2024 Campaign has launched a fundraising page using the Coinbase Commerce product, allowing eligible individuals to donate in crypto. The website features logos of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, XRP, USD Coin, Solana, and ZRX. ¬†According to the information, Elon Musk is considering Shiba Inu and Dogecoin as the better investment option.It's worth noting that Donald Trump recently held a dinner for those who bought NFTs featuring his mugshot from the time he surrendered at the Georgia jail. During this event, he asked his supporters to donate to his campaign in cryptocurrency.The president's support is a big boost for the US crypto industry which has ramped up lobbying efforts and has spent millions on the upcoming 2024 elections. This has become a new focus area for Trump to continue bashing Biden. He also disagreed with the administration‚Äôs stance on the matter, pointing out that SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been aggressively antagonistic towards crypto companies for failing to register with the agency. ‚ÄúThe Democrats are very much against it,‚Äù Trump stated.Cryptocurrency Becomes The Center Of Attraction Amid US ElectionCryptocurrency has become the center point of the US presidential election. The two parties have different views on cryptocurrency. Democratic Party candidate and current President Joe Biden has never shown support for cryptocurrency.¬† Actions and investigations by the SEC against crypto exchanges during his tenure indicate that he does not consider cryptocurrency favorable.¬†On the other hand, potential Republican candidate Donald Trump has shown a positive attitude toward crypto since the beginning of his campaign. He has also deemed the SEC investigations into crypto exchanges as wrong. Trump aims to directly connect with the crypto community by accepting cryptocurrencies as donations for his campaign.¬†For your information, about 50% of the young population in the US are crypto investors. Trump's target is to connect with this demographic directly. If the crypto community supports Trump in the presidential election, his victory could be assured. Meanwhile, Joe Biden's indifferent attitude towards crypto continues to widen the gap between him and the crypto community, which could be a significant disadvantage for him in the election.Also Read: First-Ever Standalone Crypto Legislation By The U.S.

Tether mints another $1 billion USDT this week; Is a market pump ahead?


    Tether, the world‚Äôs largest stablecoin issuer, has minted an additional 1 billion USDT tokens on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, fueling speculation about a potential market surge.¬†



This development coincides with the crypto community‚Äôs anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) decision on a spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF), expected later this week.







Tether‚Äôs CEO, Paolo Ardoino, clarified on X (formerly Twitter) that this issuance was for ‚Äúinventory replenishment‚Äù and was an ‚Äúauthorized but not issued transaction.‚Äù







This means the tokens will be used as inventory for future issuance requests and chain swaps, but are not yet in circulation. This move is viewed by market analysts as a strategic preparation for a potential market rally fueled by the expected approval of an ETH ETF.



Ivan Sherbakov, CEO of Cryptorobotics, speculated that¬† this influx of liquidity will be used to pump the market ahead of ETF news.







Historically, an increase in USDT supply has been linked with broader upward trends in the crypto market, leading to increased trading volumes and a more vibrant digital asset environment.



Tether‚Äôs market impact



As of May 22, Tether‚Äôs Transparency page shows $87.8 million worth of these USDT tokens on Ethereum. Tether‚Äôs market cap has grown significantly over the past year, exceeding $111 billion and accounting for roughly 70% of the stablecoin market.¬†



This growth has been driven by various factors, including the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and Tether‚Äôs diversification into areas like Bitcoin mining.



Concerns and considerations



Despite the positive market implications, some analysts have expressed concerns about Tether‚Äôs lack of transparency. Deutsche Bank analysts have highlighted potential risks associated with Tether‚Äôs significant market dominance.



With the total stablecoin market capitalization exceeding $160.9 billion, Tether holds a significant share.¬†



These transparency issues and market dominance continue to be debated among analysts and investors, even as Tether‚Äôs actions could trigger significant market movements if the ETF is approved.

Bitcoin key support and resistance levels to watch for a possible breakout


    Bitcoin (BTC) revisited the $70,000 price zone in a bullish seven days, powered by macroeconomic indicators and overall positive sentiments in the cryptocurrency market. Finbold looked for insights on key support and resistance levels to watch for in the last week of May.



Notably, Bitcoin has been trading in a well-defined range since March, from $60,000 to $72,000. During this time, BTC has made two brief deviations‚Äîof two days each‚Äîfrom the price range. One in mid-March made an all-time high at $73,805, and the other in early May flash-crashed to $56,590.



Therefore, the $60,000 and the $72,000 levels remain the most important support and resistance to watch for. A breakout, followed by confirmation with increased volume, from any of these levels would bring a more aggressive move.







In the meantime, the $70,000 price makes a relevant psychological resistance that Bitcoin is currently testing. Moreover, the 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA) has also been a key level, now making support at $65,200/btc.

Bitcoin on-chain data for key support and resistance levels



Looking further, Finbold gathered on-chain data from IntoTheBlock on May 22, which highlights other key levels to watch for.



In particular, the ‚ÄúIn/Out of the Money Around Price‚Äù metric shows strong support at lower prices than current ones. The largest volume is within the $63,728 to $65,830 level, at an average of $64,689. 1.79 million addresses purchased over 953,260 BTC at these prices and are currently in profit.



On the other hand, there is no relevant volume to the upside, suggesting weaker resistance to the range‚Äôs top for BTC at above $72,000.



In/Out of the Money Around Price. Source: IntoTheBlock



Is Bitcoin ready for new all-time highs?



In this context, Finbold checked Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚ÄúMarket Value To Realized Value‚Äù (MVRV) Ratio of the last 90 days on Santiment.



MVRV shows the ratio between the current price and the average price of every coin acquired. Essentially, higher ratios surge in potential resistance, foreshadowing increased selling activity, while the opposite is also valid to form support.



As of this writing, the 90-day MVRV ratio at 6% suggests a neutral outlook, with weak resistance at $70,000. Nevertheless, these prices have a proportionally low ratio compared to the 35% seen in March.



Hence, Bitcoin might make new all-time highs in the following days or weeks.

In conclusion, Bitcoin‚Äôs key support and resistance levels to watch are $60,000, $64,690, $70,000, and $72,000. The support levels are stronger than the resistance, which suggests a breakout to the upside. It is important, however, to understand that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile digital assets, and indicators are not conclusive.

Ethereum Rally Looms: Analyst Predicts ETH's Next Stop Is $5,300


																Titan of Crypto, a well-known cryptocurrency trader and expert, in a daring prediction that has drawn the attention of the crypto community, forecasting an impending significant rally for Ethereum (ETH) to unprecedented heights while putting his next price target for the crypto asset at the pivotal $5,300 level.
The analyst‚Äôs prognosis indicates that Ethereum, fueled by favorable market circumstances and rising investors‚Äô confidence, is poised for massive gains. This forecast comes at the heel of ETH‚Äôs recent robust price performance and increasing market optimism.
Ethereum Path To Massive Rally
In February, Titan of Crypto hinted at the formation of a Bullish Cypher Pattern on Ethereum‚Äòs weekly chart. ‚ÄúJust like for Bitcoin, a bullish cypher pattern is currently playing out on ETH weekly chart as well,‚Äù he stated.

Due to this, the expert pointed out several targets for the asset to reach in the near term, such as $2,410, $2,881, $3,353, and $4,024, indicating a 38.20%, 50.00%, 61.80%, 78.60% upswingm respectively, from the current price then.
Earlier this month, Titan of Crypto noted that the bullish cypher pattern has successfully developed, and the aforementioned price targets have all been achieved, suggesting a substantial rally is on the horizon.
Potential rally to $5,300 level | Source: Titan of Crypto on X
At that time, the crypto expert underscored that ETH was at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, which he also dubbed the 1st stop ($2,880). Should the coin manage to sustain this level, Titan of Crypto anticipates a move on the upside from the level.
However, today, as predicted by the expert, Ethereum performed a flawless recovery from the 1st stop ($2,880) point. As a result, the crypto asset is currently forming a bull flag pattern on the weekly timeframe, citing $5,300 as the next price target for ETH to reach.¬†
However, this is not the final destination, suggesting the potential for Ethereum to surge even higher in the upcoming months. With ETH displaying strong price performance, it could mean that the Altcoin season could be coming into play in the near future.
Indicator That Suggests A Price Correction On The Downside
Although Titan of Crypto anticipates a massive rally for ETH, Ali Martinez has underlined the potential for the asset to decline soon.¬† According to Ali Martinez, the TD Sequential indicator on Ethereum‚Äôs 4-hour timeframe on May 15, previously displayed a promising buy signal. This development practically led to a 32% rise in the price of Ethereum.

	Related Reading



However, now that the ETH Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are generating so much buzz, the indicator has transitioned to a sell signal. Consequently, Ali Martinez predicts a downward correction of one to four candlesticks.
At the time of writing, ETH had increased by over 28% in the past week, trading at around $3,728. Despite the recent price momentum, the asset‚Äôs market cap and trading volume are down by 1.56% and 28%, respectively.

Ripple Unveils Ticker For New Stablecoin In Trademark Filing


								Ripple Labs Inc. has filed a trademark application that suggests ‚ÄúRLUSD‚Äù as the ticker for its upcoming dollar-based stablecoin. This development comes amid growing anticipation within the XRP community regarding the company‚Äôs new financial product, which aims to integrate seamlessly with On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), recently rebranded as Ripple Payments.
Details On Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD Trademark Filing
According to details from Justia Trademarks, the filing, identified under serial number 98537677, was made on May 7, 2024. This application is still in the early stages of processing, listed under the status ‚Äú630 ‚Äì New Application ‚Äì Record Initialized Not Assigned To Examiner.‚Äù The attorney of record for this filing is Olivia Maria Baratta from Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP.

The filing specifies a broad range of financial services tied to this trademark, which include but are not limited to ‚Äúmonetary services for receiving and disbursing payments and gifts in virtual and digital currency and digital tokens of value determined by fiat currency over a computer network.‚Äù Moreover, the application covers ‚Äúfinancial management and administration services, such as facilitating transfers of digital currency and electronic transmission of digital currency.‚Äù
This move by Ripple marks a significant step towards launching its stablecoin, which had been hinted at earlier this year. In April 2024, the company had expressed its intentions to delve into the stablecoin market, a strategic pivot aiming to harness a market sector that is projected to burgeon to a near $3 trillion valuation in the upcoming years.

The choice of RLUSD as a ticker symbol appears to be a tactical decision, influenced by the preoccupation of other potential tickers such as USDX and USDR by other entities. Flare Networks has already introduced USDX as a stablecoin on its blockchain platform, while USDR is currently utilized by Real USD. These circumstances presumably led Ripple to settle on the designation of RLUSD for its stablecoin initiative.
While the formal launch and full details of the stablecoin are still forthcoming, the trademark filing marks another major step for Ripple‚Äôs broad vision for a full-service crypto company. The company has yet to issue an official statement regarding the detailed features and launch timeline for RLUSD.
As previously revealed, the primary motivation for introducing a stablecoin and integrating it with its payment platform is to enhance its Ripple Payments solution for cross-border transactions. The stablecoin will enable US based customers to leverage stablecoin for international payments through Ripple Payments, as an alternative to using XRP.
‚ÄúI see stablecoins as a complement or even an accelerant to what Ripple‚Äôs doing at its core,‚Äù Garlinghouse remarked during a recent interview with the CEO of SCB 10X.
At press time, XRP traded at 0.53379.

                        United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler released a statement Wednesday morning criticizing the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) ahead of the crypto regulation‚Äôs expected vote in the House today.SEC Chair Gary Gensler Pushes Back On FIT21 Before House Vote
In a blog post published on the SEC‚Äôs website Wednesday, Gensler claimed the bill would¬†in part ‚Äúcreate new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts,‚Äù ultimately ‚Äúputting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.‚ÄùIn particular, the federal regulator argued that FIT21 would work against already established securities law by negating the long-accepted Howey Test while reneging current regulations on investment contracts, allowing crypto operators to ‚Äúself-certify‚Äù their products.‚ÄúThe crypto industry‚Äôs record of failures, frauds, and bankruptcies is not because we don‚Äôt have rules or because the rules are unclear. It‚Äôs because many players in the crypto industry don‚Äôt play by the rules,‚Äù Gensler continued.‚ÄúWe should make the policy choice to protect the investing public over facilitating business models of non-compliant firms.‚ÄùCrypto Regulations Finally See Traction On Capitol Hill
Gensler‚Äôs commentary comes amidst a wave of momentum for crypto regulation on Capitol Hill, signaling potential pushback from U.S. lawmakers over the SEC‚Äôs current regulatory regimen towards digital assets.Earlier this month, both chambers of Congress voted on a resolution that would effectively overturn the SEC‚Äôs controversial crypto accounting guidance known as SAB121.In a statement shortly following the vote disavowing SAB121, pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) claimed it was ‚Äúa win for financial innovation and a clear rebuke of the way the Biden admin and Gary Gensler have persecuted crypto.‚ÄùGensler has long ruffled the feathers of key players in the crypto space, with the federal agency doling a swath of litigation to digital asset organizations for allegedly breaking U.S. securities law.Meanwhile, Ripple‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, the blockchain firm currently locked in a contentious legal battle with the SEC over the sale of cryptocurrency XRP, took to X early on Wednesday to criticize Gensler‚Äôs leadership of the SEC.‚ÄúGensler overplayed his hand. He thought crypto was an easy target,‚Äù Alderoty wrote. ‚ÄúHe relished being the guy that everyone loved to hate. He thought he was above Congressional oversight. That‚Äôs all gone. He‚Äôs now a struggling political liability.‚ÄùShould U.S. lawmakers advance FIT21, it would mark the U.S. government‚Äôs first successful push for a crypto regulatory framework and a strong reprimand of Gensler‚Äôs treatment of digital assets.

If SEC approves ether ETF, will it approve altcoin ETFs?


With the likelihood of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot ether ETF suddenly rising, altcoin investors are speculating on a possible flurry of approvals for additional coins. 
Indeed, just this morning, WisdomTree gained approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority to list its 100% physically backed Ethereum ETP on the London Stock Exchange as early as May 28 ‚Äî although the products will not be available for retail investment.
The bullish momentum for ether, which is up 29% this week alone, might spill over into other crypto assets.
On Monday, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas declared that the likelihood of the SEC approving a spot ether ETF had jumped from 25% to 75% thanks to the agency‚Äôs reported commentary to at least one exchange and one ETF applicant regarding their 19b-4 exchange rule change request.
The Wall Street Journal confirmed the news while CoinDesk also cited three people familiar with the matter. Around the same time and without citing 19b-4 news, David Han at Coinbase Institutional wrote a note adjusting his outlook for a spot ether ETF upward.
Barrons claimed staff workers at the SEC told exchanges ‚Äúthat it is leaning toward approving them, according to people familiar with the matter.‚Äù
As early as tomorrow, the SEC could approve a so-called 19b-4 filing that, alongside a related S-1 filing the deadline of which is weeks away, might lead to an eventual listing of a spot ether ETF by investment manager VanEck.
Other ETF sponsors have also filed 19b-4 applications with the SEC for a spot ether ETF, including Fidelity, 21Shares, Invesco/Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. VanEck requested the earliest response date: tomorrow.

Will a spot ether ETF lead to other altcoin ETFs?
Certainly, ether is just one of many altcoins trading on US stock exchanges via trusts. There are over a dozen trusts publicly trading in the US holding alternate crypto assets: Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Decentraland (MANA), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Filecoin (FIL), Polkadot (DOT), Horizon (ZEN), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Livepeer (LPT), Zcash (ZEC), and Solana (SOL).
So, if the SEC approves a spot ether ETF, could it also approve ETFs for additional altcoins?
The logic of altcoin proponents ‚Äî arguing that non-ether spot altcoin ETFs might gain SEC approval shortly after a spot ether ETF ‚Äî usually follows a simple argument: If the SEC permitted Grayscale to convert its bitcoin trust into an ETF, why would commissioners deny trust sponsors of other crypto assets to convert into an ETF?
For obvious reasons, that argument might fail if the SEC claims the crypto asset is an unregistered security. However, the SEC hasn‚Äôt classified all crypto assets held in US public trusts as securities.
Interestingly, many crypto trusts trading on OTC Markets, a US stock exchange, hold expressly SEC-designated unregistered securities, including SOL, MANA, and FIL. More crypto assets are rumored to be SEC-designated unregistered securities: ZEN, XLM, and ZEN.¬†
Nevertheless, there are certain trusts trading on US OTC Markets that don‚Äôt hold SEC-designated unregistered securities, such as DOT or ETC trusts. Perhaps, if the SEC were to approve a spot ether ETF, commissioners might approve spot ETFs based on such possibly non-security crypto assets.
It‚Äôs worth noting that just because the SEC hasn‚Äôt classified a crypto asset as an unregistered security doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs not. Congress didn‚Äôt task the SEC to proactively classify all assets. Instead, the SEC simply chooses to accept or reject applications that it receives, or file enforcement actions against illegal conduct on a case-by-case basis, as it has the time, money, staff, and resources.
Silence from commissioners doesn‚Äôt indicate non-designation.
Of course, there is a counterargument against this logic. Unlike altcoins like DOT or ETC, only bitcoin and ether have futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). This CME market of significant size for ether alone might be a carrying reason for approving only a spot ether ETF and not any other altcoin.
Spot ether ETF: No longer an obvious SEC rejection?
According to reports from Bloomberg, Barron‚Äôs, and Wall Street Journal sources, the Trading and Markets Division at the SEC has requested amendments to an exchange and sponsor‚Äôs joint 19b-4 form ‚Äî likely VanEck. This is a bullish sign for a possible spot ether ETF approval because, in the view of market observers, the SEC is typically silent or disinterested in 19b-4 filings if it intends to reject them.
Because the SEC is asking for a reapplication, the reasoning goes, its interest is likely a positive development.

Many viewed the SEC‚Äôs stance toward a spot ether ETF as decidedly negative. Joe Lubin‚Äôs ConsenSys even sued the SEC claiming that commissioners had secretly categorized ether as an unregistered security.
Therefore, if the SEC is actually considering a possible approval of a spot ETF for Ethereum, it would be a marked change of tone.

Amid all of these media reports, the price of ether has rallied by 29% over the past seven days ‚Äî outperforming bitcoin‚Äôs 12% rally by an additional 17%.
Form 19b-4 asks applicants for the information necessary for the public to understand why the SEC should change its Section 19(b)(1) rules pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In this case, the exchange and an ETF sponsor must explain why the SEC should allow ether to be used as the sole asset of a spot ETF.

UK Approves First Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Products | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to Bloomberg, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UK‚Äôs financial regulator, has approved the first cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs), marking a milestone in the UK‚Äôs approach to digital asset investment.



An ETP is a type of security traded on stock exchanges, similar to individual stocks. ETPs are designed to track the performance of a specific index, commodity, currency, or other benchmark, allowing investors to gain exposure to various asset classes without directly owning the underlying assets. ETPs can include different structures, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchange-traded notes (ETNs), and exchange-traded commodities (ETCs).



An ETF is a specific type of ETP that pools together various assets, such as stocks, bonds, or commodities, into a single fund. ETFs aim to replicate the performance of a specific index or benchmark and are structured as investment funds. When you invest in an ETF, you own shares of the fund, which, in turn, owns the underlying assets. ETFs are typically regulated under investment company laws, which provide certain protections and requirements for investors. Additionally, ETFs can distribute dividends to investors if the underlying assets generate income.



The main difference between ETPs and ETFs lies in their structure and scope. ETPs is a broad category that includes various types of exchange-traded securities, not limited to funds. They can encompass notes and commodities as well. While ETFs are a subset of ETPs and are specifically structured as investment funds, other types of ETPs, like ETNs, are debt instruments issued by banks. ETFs are regulated under specific investment fund regulations, while other types of ETPs, such as ETNs, may have different regulatory frameworks. Moreover, ETNs carry the credit risk of the issuer as they are debt securities, whereas ETFs do not have this risk since they own the underlying assets directly. Another distinction is that ETFs can distribute dividends to investors, whereas ETNs do not because they do not directly own the underlying assets.



Per Bloomberg‚Äôs article, WisdomTree Inc. announced today that it has received FCA approval to list two physically-backed crypto ETPs, which will track Bitcoin and Ether, on the London Stock Exchange. These products are expected to begin trading as early as 28 May 2024. 







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Several other issuers, including ETC Group, 21Shares, and CoinShares, have also applied to list their crypto products in the UK. As of midday on Wednesday, the FCA‚Äôs approval list included entries from WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Invesco Digital Markets Plc, all set to be part of the first batch of trading on the approval date.



Despite this advancement, the FCA has implemented stringent rules surrounding these products. WisdomTree‚Äôs Bitcoin and Ether ETPs, although physically-backed, are only available to professional investors. This restriction is stricter compared to the United States, where the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January has led to significant market growth. Bloomberg says that in the US, these ETFs now manage a combined $59 billion, which is nearly five times the total for similar crypto vehicles traded in Europe.



ETPs linked to cryptocurrencies have been trading on other European stock exchanges for years. The approval of such products by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year played a crucial role in propelling Bitcoin to a record high in March and has facilitated broader adoption among retail and institutional investors.











However, not all global markets have seen the same enthusiasm. In Hong Kong, despite the approval of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, investor response has been lukewarm. This contrast highlights the varying degrees of market maturity and investor interest in different regions.



ETC Group confirmed that its application is still under review, while 21Shares has already secured approval. CoinShares and the FCA declined to comment on their status, and Invesco had no immediate response.

In a reshuffling move, dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) has lost its market spot to Avalanche (AVAX).Shiba Inu has remained in 11th place in the market rankings after falling out of the top 10 due to profit-taking following its stunning 300% increase in late February to early March.¬†Despite the profit-taking that followed, Shiba Inu fiercely defended its rankings, remaining in 11th place throughout.However, Shiba Inu's resolve has been tested with Avalanche overtaking it, pushing it to 12th place in the crypto market rankings.¬†Shiba Inu's drop in the rankings coincides with a larger market fall that has seen SHIB lose roughly 4% of its value in the last 24 hours. This fall follows profit-taking after the SHIB price reached a high of $0.00002684 during today's trading session.¬†Market Rankings, Courtesy: CoinMarketCapEarlier in the week, crypto prices rose on hints of progress toward U.S. approval of exchange-traded funds investing directly in Ethereum as optimism revived.SHIB's price climbed alongside the market, but to a smaller extent. SHIB is currently up 5.15% over the last seven days, as its gains were relatively muted by the stiff daily MA 50 barrier near $0.000025.¬†In recent weeks, specifically since mid-April, Shiba Inu's price has been constricted by the daily SMA 50 barrier. Shiba Inu consistently faced a battle surpassing this level; however, the bulls made a successful attempt on May 20 before confronting resistance.¬†Conversely, Avalanche experienced a surge in value, climbing over 18% in the past week. This growth has propelled AVAX to overtake SHIB, with a current market capitalization of $15.6 billion compared to Shiba Inu's $14.8 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.As the market scenario unfolds, eyes will be on Shiba Inu to see if it can sustain its rise above the tough daily MA 50 barrier. Whether SHIB can reclaim its position or AVAX will continue to climb the ranks remains to be seen.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler criticizes crypto market bill before House vote

Hours before the U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on a crypto bill, president Biden released a statement saying that he is against the legislation, but he isn‚Äôt threatening to veto it.Why Bitcoin and Ether are skyrocketingThe White House expressed opposition to the bill, ‚ÄòThe Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21),‚Äô on Wednesday afternoon, due to concerns over inadequate investor protections.The bill, ‚ÄòThe Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), would effectively classify cryptocurrency as a commodity, not a security, and therefore make it exempt from securities regulations.‚ÄúThe Administration is eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system,‚Äù the White House statement said. ‚ÄúH.R. 4763 in its current form lacks sufficient protections for consumers and investors who engage in certain digital asset transactions.‚ÄùThe statement comes a few hours after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler publicly expressed his opposition to the bill. Gensler stated, ‚ÄúFIT21 would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.‚Äù He reiterated his stance on cryptocurrency as securities, expressing concern that the bill would exclude blockchain-recorded investment contracts from the statutory definition of securities and, hence, the protections of the federal securities laws.‚ÄúFurther, by removing this set of investment contracts from the statutory list of securities, the bill implies what courts have repeatedly ruled ‚Äî but what crypto market participants have attempted to deny ‚Äî that many crypto assets are being offered and sold as securities under existing law,‚Äù the chair added.The bill would allow companies to self-certify that they are issuing digital commodities and also give the SEC 60 days to determine if those assets fit the bill‚Äôs definition of digital commodities.‚ÄúThere are more than 16,000 crypto assets that currently exist. Given limits on staff resources, and no new resources provided by the bill, it is implausible that the SEC could review and challenge more than a fraction of those assets,‚Äù he said.FIT21 was introduced last summer to determine whether a cryptocurrency should be classified as a commodity or a security and assign oversight accordingly between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Per Forbes, the Republican candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump and his advisors also support the crypto market structure bill. Trump, who used to criticize crypto as a scam against the U.S. dollar, is now promoting himself as crypto‚Äôs candidate. Yesterday, he announced that he would start accepting campaign donations in crypto.The crypto industry has been eagerly awaiting regulatory actions from the U.S. authorities and advocating for changes in laws to prevent crypto from being categorized as a security. The SEC Chair, however, has referred to crypto as a security from time to time and claims it falls under his jurisdiction. Gensler, who once taught a course on blockchain and cryptocurrencies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is known for his strict approach to regulating crypto. He‚Äôs called the cryptocurrency market a Wild West, emphasizing its need for regulation.

Why I‚Äôm a single-issue crypto voter - Blockworks


Given the events of the past two years, everyone in the United States in both parties should be single-issue voters in favor of crypto having a level playing field. In particular, we should support all politicians who oppose the Biden administration‚Äôs extreme efforts to kill the industry in the United States, regardless of party, Republican or Democrat.¬†
This stance is not about being pro-crypto, it is about being pro-fairness. Today, the actions of the executive branch target the crypto industry, but who will be the next target under future administrations? Fossil fuel producers? Abortion providers? Public sector unions? Gun manufacturers? Green energy companies? The press?
As a people, we cannot allow government misbehavior of this sort, and it must be our primary source of concern. If we cannot secure fair treatment under the law for all, every other right we enjoy as Americans is threatened.
Why do I believe this?
In the beginning of US regulatory engagement, we had a few strict crypto regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services with its BitLicense regime. Even so, those regulators intended for crypto did exist, just within the rules.¬†
In 2022, however, we began to see regulators take it upon themselves to judge that an industry should not exist and begin to take any and all actions to destroy it. As a result, we have seen a staggering variety of inappropriate and, in some cases, illegal actions from federal agencies against crypto.
The SEC has been sanctioned by a federal judge in Utah for lying in court, bankrupting a business and destroying lives to get a TRO in the Debt Box case. The SEC treated the BTC ETF application process so inappropriately that it was ultimately overruled by a different federal judge who called its behavior ‚Äúarbitrary and capricious.‚Äù The SEC promulgated a rule on crypto custody called SAB 121 without consulting the industry or other regulators, which is so mechanically broken it has essentially banned regulated financial entities from offering crypto custody and caused both houses of Congress to vote in bipartisan fashion to overrule it.¬†
Additionally, the SEC somehow managed to sue Ripple, Coinbase, Kraken and Uniswap Labs while failing completely to sue either FTX, Terraform Labs, Celsius, 3AC or BlockFi before their various collapses harmed countless investors and consumers.
Banking regulators have engaged in similarly inappropriate behavior. From issuing a joint letter in February 2023 that unilaterally called tokens on public blockchains ‚Äúhighly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices‚Äù to pressuring banks to de-platform their crypto customers without evidence of legal wrongdoing or undue risk through ‚ÄúOperation Chokepoint 2.0,‚Äù they have also overreached. The Federal Reserve continues to deny Custodia, a regulated bank in Wyoming, an account.
Across the board, our federal government‚Äôs approach to crypto reeks of bias and misconduct. If we cannot trust the federal government to play fair, then all other political positions fade in importance until the checks and balances of the system are restored. In this case, it is important to remember that the ultimate check on both the executive and the legislative branches is the people.¬†
My belief is that crypto deserves fair treatment. While Republicans have been the recent champions of the industry thanks to their pro-business views, forward-thinking Democrat Ritchie Torres wrote an op-ed in 2022 titled ‚ÄúThe Liberal Case for Cryptocurrency.‚Äù Long after Trump is gone from crypto, Torres and other Democrats will remain. More than 30 Democrats between the House and Senate broke ranks with the administration to vote down SAB 121.¬†
Fair treatment under the law is a stance all Americans of all parties can rally behind. As a long-time Democrat myself, I believe this stance will stand the test of time for both parties. Even politicians who do not care about or even dislike crypto should be able to support the basic point that obeying the law and having fair rules is essential. If they can‚Äôt, we should vote them out.
I believe we should vote for any politician, Democrat or Republican, who rejects things like the SEC‚Äôs illegal antics in the Debt Box case or the gross misconduct of the head of the FDIC. We must secure the basic fairness of our system and hold accountable those who flagrantly violate it.
That is why I am a single issue voter on this topic. It is not that I am pro-crypto, it is that I am pro-fairness.

‚ÄòEuphoric Bull‚Äô Phase Could Be Approaching for Bitcoin (BTC), According to On-Chain Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin (BTC) could be approaching a ‚Äúeuphoric bull‚Äù phase, according to a popular on-chain analyst.
The pseudonymous analyst known as Checkmate tells his 91,100 followers on the social media platform X that BTC is approaching a ‚Äúdecision point.‚Äù










‚ÄúBitcoin breaking to a new ATH (all-time high) has historically represented a transition point from the Enthusiastic Bull, into the Euphoric Bull.
It also coincides with the MVRV (market value to realized value) ratio getting above 1 standard deviation, but we rarely clear it on the first attempt.‚Äù
Source: Checkmate/X
MVRV is the ratio of Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization relative to its realized capitalization (the value of all BTC at the price they were bought). It is used to assess whether the crypto asset is undervalued or overvalued.
Checkmate acknowledges that he doesn‚Äôt know when that transition point will occur.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a view on that as we cannot know. It completely depends on capital inflows, which right now look pretty healthy. Therefore, it could be that now is the time‚Ä¶ but we will have to read the tape as it happens. Predictions are not overly useful, instead, I prepare my reaction function. It isn‚Äôt about what will happen ‚Äì> it is about what you will do when it happens.‚Äù
The analyst also says the ongoing Bitcoin bull market is ‚Äúmuch, much more structured‚Äù than the 2021 bull run.
‚ÄúIt looks a lot more like 2016/17. Spot-driven, resilient. It‚Äôs just fantastic. I love what I‚Äôm seeing in this price action.‚Äù
BTC is trading at $69,815 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 2% in the past 24 hours and nearly 14% in the past seven days.

SEC Chair Gensler opposes today's FIT21 vote yet White House calls no 'veto'

Gary Gensler, Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), issued a statement on May 22 expressing strong opposition to the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act.The FIT21 Act is widely celebrated for offering regulatory clarity to the crypto industry. However, Gensler has criticized it, arguing that the bill would weaken current consumer protections in the crypto market.The President Biden administration said it opposes the bill‚Äôs passage. However, the White House clarified that it was willing to work with the US Congress to ‚Äúensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities.‚ÄùNotably, the US House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the bill later today, May 22.Gensler‚Äôs dissentGensler warned that the proposed bill would create significant regulatory gaps, undermining decades of precedent in overseeing investment contracts and putting investors and capital markets at substantial risk.The SEC chair further highlighted that the regulation would prevent blockchain-based investment contracts from being classified as securities. This change would enable crypto investment contract issuers to self-certify their products as decentralized, effectively removing them from SEC oversight. He added:‚ÄúThe SEC would only have 60 days to review and challenge the certification that a product is a digital commodity. Those that the SEC successfully challenges would be re-classified as restricted digital assets and subject to the bill‚Äôs lighter-touch SEC oversight regime that excludes many core protections. ‚ÄúMoreover, Gensler criticized the bill for abandoning the Howey Test, a key method for determining if an investment qualifies as a security. He argued that this would lead to reduced protections for the few investment contracts that are considered securities. Additionally, he pointed out the risks posed by excluding crypto asset trading platforms from being classified as exchanges.Gensler emphasized that the bill poses a significant threat to the American capital market and its investors. He stated that the legislation would undermine capital markets by allowing firms to evade enforcement actions more easily.FIT21 enjoys supportDespite Gensler‚Äôs antagonism towards the bill, the proposed legislation enjoys strong support from the US Congress and the crypto community.In a May 21 statement, Congressman French Hill, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion, said the bill gives the SEC authority over digital assets that are not certified under the legislation and would provide adequate securities to protect against another FTX-like situation.Several crypto companies, including Coinbase, Circle, Kraken, Gemini, and advocacy group Stand With Crypto, have urged US lawmakers to support the legislation. The Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) stated:‚ÄúFIT 21 will introduce new compliance challenges for digital assets companies, but regulatory clarity is indisputably more responsible, safer for consumers, and preferable to the status quo.‚ÄùAs the bill awaits today‚Äôs vote, the White House has¬†confirmed that it will not attempt to veto it if it passes, even though it does ‚Äúoppose‚Äù the bill. The vote will likely now be one of the most important pieces of crypto legislation to be voted on by Congress.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

                        The landscape of crypto taxes is varied and dynamic, with some nations emerging as particularly friendly to crypto investors and traders.Countries with low taxation on cryptocurrencies reap the benefits of increased investment, innovation, and economic growth, creating a compelling argument for the adoption of similar policies worldwide.Contrasting these havens are countries with more stringent crypto tax laws, which can stifle local market growth and push investors to seek more favorable environments.High-tax countries often see a brain drain in talent and capital, which can be detrimental in the long run.Evaluating Crypto Taxes
For crypto investors and businesses, understanding the landscape of crypto taxation is pivotal.When assessing where to invest or operate in the crypto space, several key factors come into play.First and foremost is the tax rate itself, which directly impacts the return on investment.Some countries offer zero tax on long-term capital gains, which can significantly enhance profitability.Additionally, exemptions such as threshold limits for taxable income or gains can also be a deciding factor for small traders and casual investors.However, the regulatory environment is equally critical. Clarity and stability in regulations ensure that investors understand the rules and can comply without fearing sudden changes.Moreover, the degree of crypto adoption within a country often signals how supportive its environment is towards innovation and technology-driven financial services.Here is a list of countries with best tax policies related to digital assets:1. GermanyGermany stands out in Europe as a beacon for crypto investors. If you hold your crypto investments for more than a year, you are exempt from taxes on any gains, fostering a culture of long-term investment.Smaller gains under ‚Ç¨600 are also tax-free, which encourages casual investors to participate without the burden of taxation.Even for the sale of Bitcoin within one year, capital gains tax will only be applied if the amount is more than 600 euros.2. PortugalMoving southwest, Portugal offers a favorable tax environment where crypto earnings are free of personal income tax.This exemption extends to trading cryptocurrencies, making it an attractive hub for day traders and crypto companies alike.However, it is worth noting that in 2023, the country started applying a 28% tax on short-term crypto gains from selling crypto held for less than a year.In February 2024, the country passed a bill that obliges crypto holders to declare their crypto assets in an annual IRS tax declaration3. SingaporeIn Asia, Singapore has positioned itself as a fintech hub by not imposing any capital gains tax on crypto investments.Moreover, digital payment tokens are exempt from Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Singapore.The absence of specific taxes on crypto transactions further cements its status as a forward-thinking center for financial innovation.4. MaltaMalta, known as the ‚ÄúBlockchain Island,‚Äù treats crypto transactions similarly to day trading but offers benefits for long-term holdings.Its legal framework is tailored to the nuances of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, providing a solid foundation for businesses and investors.In Malta, there is no long-term capital gains tax for cryptocurrency. However, trading cryptocurrency may be considered income taxed at a maximum of 35%.5. SwitzerlandLastly, Switzerland is renowned not just for its chocolates but also for its crypto-friendly policies.Although crypto wealth and income are subject to wealth tax, the rates are low, and professional trading can be tax-exempt, making it a hotspot for crypto finance.Comparative Analysis




Country
Benefits
Disadvantages


Germany
‚Äì No tax on crypto held for more than a year encourages long-term investment.
‚Äì Small gains under ‚Ç¨600 are tax-free, beneficial for small investors.
‚Äì Complexity in tracking and reporting each transaction‚Äôs holding period could be burdensome for active traders.


Portugal
‚Äì No personal income tax on crypto earnings makes it highly attractive for individual investors and traders.
‚Äì Trading cryptocurrencies is completely tax-free, fostering a vibrant trading environment.
‚Äì Lack of specific crypto regulations might lead to future stringent laws as the market matures, affecting current tax benefits.


Singapore
‚Äì No capital gains tax promotes a growth-friendly environment for crypto investors.
‚Äì Progressive regulatory framework attracts fintech companies and startups.
‚Äì While transaction-specific taxes are absent, other forms of taxation (like GST) might still apply, requiring careful financial planning.


Malta
‚Äì Offers a business-friendly environment with potential exemptions for long-term gains.
‚Äì Strong legal framework specifically for blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
‚Äì Day trading is taxed as business income, which could be higher than capital gains taxes, affecting high-volume traders negatively.


Switzerland
‚Äì Low wealth tax rates and possible exemptions for professional trading.
‚Äì Established as a global crypto hub, enhancing networking and business opportunities.
‚Äì Wealth tax applies to crypto assets, which could be a disadvantage compared to completely tax-free regimes in other countries.
‚Äì Regulatory complexities might arise as the framework adjusts to new market developments.



The Bottom Line
Tax policies actively shape the decisions of investors and businesses. Countries that have embraced low or no crypto taxes are not only fostering a conducive environment for growth and innovation but also positioning themselves as leaders in the burgeoning digital economy.

Legendary Peter Brandt Predicted Ethereum (ETH) Rally: What's Next?

The legend of trading outside of the cryptocurrency industry, Peter Brandt, revealed that he has been building a bullish case for Ethereum since May 17 and even included an action plan for buying. Unfortunately, he did not reveal what is going to happen with ETH in the future, nor did he provide additional details on his buying plan. That is why we will have to address the price chart we have right now.Obviously, Ethereum is ripping and tearing the market right now, with the price of the second-biggest cryptocurrency slicing through the $3,600 resistance like a knife through butter. One way or another, there is no base below the price, so keep in mind that any correction could turn into a substantial one.ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewWith the breakthrough above $3,600, we should be ready for a stronger move up at around the 50-200 EMAs. But as we mentioned above, do not fall for the rapid price increase as prices after that are really unstable. Also, keep in mind that even Brandt's plan could include a bearish scenario in which Ether reverses around $4,000.However, with such rapid gains, the risk of a correction is always present. Ethereum's current price surge lacks a solid support base, meaning that any pullback could potentially lead to a significant drop. Traders should be cautious and consider setting stop-loss orders to protect their investments.By using RSI, we can determine whether or not Ethereum is entering the overbought zone. Unfortunately, for now, the indicator shows that Ether is on the verge of becoming overbought and potentially facing a reversal in the foreseeable future. Thus, if you are going long, make sure to avoid overleveraging existing positions.¬†In general, Brandt's bullishness on Ethereum around May 17 made some sense, considering ETH reaching the local support level of the 200 EMA, which acted as a springboard for it.

                        The price of DogWifMAGA Coin has fallen by 73% in the past 24 hours, with the new meme token correcting heavily after a big launch at the start of the week.Running on Solana, WIFMAGA had risen by as much as 50,000% in the day that followed its listing on Raydium, with the token trending on social media.Yet it has plunged significantly today, with the coin‚Äôs founders likely dumping their bags on the retail investors who‚Äôd jumped on its bandwagon.It may struggle to recover in any meaningful way, yet there are better alternatives available to traders seeking above-average gains, with multi-chain token Dogeverse one of the most promising new coins in the market right now.DogWifMAGA Coin Price Skyrockets as Presidential Elections Heat Up
There are two key features of DogWIFMAGA Coin‚Äôs chart, and both involve sharp declines.Firstly, the token‚Äôs price has declined consistently ever since reaching a high on Tuesday, and at the moment it doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs going to recover.Source: DEXTools/TradingViewOne reason for this pessimism is that, secondly, the coin‚Äôs volume has also dried up, suggesting a very quick loss of interest.At the moment, its 24-hour volume stands only at $4 million, in contrast to $27 billion for Ethereum, for example, and $800 million for BONK (to take another Solana-based meme coin).As such, it would be unwise to assume that it‚Äôs going to recover anytime soon.This is particularly the case when its presence and fundamentals are minimal, even if some traders have been bigging it up in the past day.The coin‚Äôs only hope is that it attracts listings from major centralized exchanges, although its listing on Poloniex today has done little to resuscitate its price so far.It‚Äôs therefore uncertain as to whether we‚Äôll see DogWifMAGA Coin recover, unless a wave of new listings boosts it.It has launched at a time when the United States is gearing up for yet another election between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, with whom the coin is unofficially associating itself.Yet because it lacks any real credentials or fundamentals, it would be irresponsible to suggest that a comeback is certain.Buy Now or Is This Other Coin the Real Winner?
DogWifMAGA Coin may be inherently risky, yet there are some¬†new meme tokens that actually show more potential for gains in the near future.Possibly the likeliest to make gains soon is¬†Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain crypto that has raised more than $15 million in its heavily subscribed presale.Source: DogeverseWhat‚Äôs special about Dogeverse is that it‚Äôs the market‚Äôs first Doge-themed multi-chain cryptocurrency, running on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.Its availability on multiple chains means it could gain traction on many more apps and trading platforms than it would have otherwise.And by attracting more usage, it will, in theory, see its price rise over time.This will find help from the fact that it has a capped supply of 120 million tokens, meaning that it‚Äôs a deflationary cryptocurrency (unlike most other meme coins).On top of this, holders will be able to stake to token, something which could see a big proportion of its total supply exit circulation.Such tokenomics help explain why so many investors have ploughed into its sale, which newcomers can still join by going to the official Dogeverse website.1 DOGEVERSE is selling at a final sale price of $0.00031, although it‚Äôs likely to exceed this level comfortably once it lists in the next few weeks.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Nexo Fee Fury: Users Slam Crypto Exchange After Surprise Hike


								The cryptocurrency exchange landscape is a battlefield of trust. With centralized platforms still reeling from high-profile scandals like FTX and Celsius, any misstep can send user loyalty plummeting. Nexo, a platform that had recently emerged relatively unscathed, now finds itself in hot water after a surprise fee increase sparked outrage amongst its customer base.

From Hero To Zero: Trust Eroded By Unannounced Fees
Nexo had managed to carve out a niche as a customer-centric exchange. Their ability to dodge legal troubles and a swift reversal of a disliked fee policy in April had painted a picture of a platform that listened. However, this carefully crafted image shattered on May 21st when users woke up to emails announcing a significant hike in bank transfer fees.
The new structure imposed a ¬£5/‚Ç¨5 charge for FPS/SEPA withdrawals and a hefty $25/¬£25 fee for SWIFT transactions. This abrupt change ignited a firestorm on social media platforms like Reddit, with users expressing a mix of betrayal and frustration.

‚ÄúThey practically sent out the email after or at the exact moment they implemented it,‚Äù commented one disgruntled user, echoing a common sentiment. Many worried that this was just the tip of the iceberg, fearing a slippery slope of additional charges down the line.
The backlash extended beyond mere grumbling. One user on X, a popular social media platform, took a direct jab at Nexo‚Äôs aspirations, stating, ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt replace banks if you‚Äôre worse than them.‚Äù This highlights the core issue ‚Äì Nexo‚Äôs attempt to position itself as a disruptive force in finance now appears undermined by its own fee practices.


Communication Gap: Nexo‚Äôs Defense Rings Hollow
In response to the growing discontent, Nexo attempted to quell the flames by claiming the new fees were simply passing on costs incurred with third-party payment processors. A company moderator further asserted Nexo‚Äôs commitment to ‚Äúkeep transactions accessible and affordable.‚Äù These justifications, however, fell flat with many users.

The lack of transparency and the absence of any prior warning were major sticking points. The timing, coming just weeks after the community lauded Nexo for reversing the loan repayment fee, added another layer of sting.

How Blockchain Technology Can Combat the Rising Threat of AI-Generated Deepfakes

For those unfamiliar, a public blockchain transparently records information in a time-bound manner, accessible to all, globally, and without gatekeeping. This allows anyone to verify the validity of information, such as its creator or a timestamp, making it a source of truth. Public blockchains are also decentralized, eliminating the need for a central decision-maker, and reducing the risk of manipulation. This decentralized structure also offers high network security by eliminating single points of failure, and ensuring an immutable and tamper-resistant record.

Elon Musk Issues 'Black Mirror' Warning, Shibarium on Verge of Major Record, Samson Mow Makes Bullish Bitcoin Statement: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


U.Today presents you with the top three news stories over the past day.Elon Musk issues important ‚ÄúBlack Mirror‚Äù statement to warn communityIn a recent¬†X post, Elon Musk, the world-famous centibillionaire who takes heightened interest in the latest technological developments,¬†expressed his distrust in a new Microsoft feature. The feature is called "Recall" and, according to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it¬†represents a semantic search of users' entire history, which will help them find anything they have ever seen or done on their PCs. "Recall's" principle is simple: Windows will be constantly taking screenshots of your computer screen, then it will use a generative AI model, along with the NPU, to process all that data and make it searchable. Despite the promising utility, Musk criticized the feature, comparing it to what an episode of the "Black Mirror" series might show, implying that the series' dystopian scenario of technologies controlling humanity is getting closer to reality. "Definitely turning this 'feature' off," wrote Musk, perhaps hinting that the data collected by "Recall" could potentially be easily accessed and used to control users‚Äô actions.Shibarium on verge of major record as transactions shoot up 209%Along with the rest of the market,¬†Shibarium, Shiba Inu's layer-2 solution, has recently been seeing the positive effects of a new uptrend. According to data provided by Shibariumscan, the daily transaction count surged from 6,000 on May 14 to 18,560 on May 20, representing more than 209% growth. For weeks, the number of daily transitions on Shibarium remained relatively flat, but things changed after the Shibarium hard fork was implemented on the mainnet. This was a turning point for the Ethereum L2 protocol. With the transaction surge, Shibarium is now aiming to break the record of 420 million total transactions. Even though it remains unknown when exactly this will be accomplished, Shibarium has the right catalyst to help it drive its position to a new level overall. Currently, the total transaction count on Shibarium stands at 417,525,512, per Shibariumscan's data.Bullish Bitcoin statement issued by Samson Mow: ‚ÄúOmega coming‚ÄùBitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, has finally made the long-awaited move toward revisiting its all-time high, climbing back to the $71,000 level ‚Äì the highest price level since April 1, when BTC traded at $71,330. The likely catalysts for BTC's sudden recovery were the positive CPI data, which showed a weakening inflation rate, as well as a whole week of inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Such a positive change in the Bitcoin price could not go unnoticed by Jan3 CEO¬†Samson Mow, a renowned BTC maximalist who once predicted that the aforementioned asset could reach as high as $1 million one day. Mow took to his X handle to comment on the BTC price surge, making yet another prediction; this time, it concerns the coming of an Omega Bitcoin candle soon. As previously explained by the CEO, an Omega candle is a large trading candle on a Bitcoin chart accompanied by high volatility moves. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is changing hands at $70,006, down by 0.25% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.

Even Developers Aren't Sure How AI Models Work-But We're Finally Getting Answers - Decrypt

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models can do pretty incredible things with just a prompt, but there‚Äôs a big¬†open secret behind them: Even their creators don‚Äôt know exactly how they‚Äôre able to do what they do, or why such results can vary from prompt to prompt. But now, one of the most prominent generative AI model creators is starting to break open that ‚Äúblack box.‚ÄùAnthropic, a leading AI research company formed by ex-OpenAI researchers, has published a paper detailing a new method for interpreting the inner workings of its large language model, Claude.This innovative approach, dubbed "dictionary learning," has allowed researchers to identify millions of connections‚Äîwhich they call ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù‚Äîwithin Claude's neural network, each representing a specific concept that the AI understands.The ability to identify and understand these features offers unprecedented insight into how a large language model (LLM) processes information (how it thinks) and generates responses (how it acts). It also gives Anthropic leverage in modifying models without having to retrain them. It could also pave the way for other researchers to apply the dictionary learning technique into their own weights, to understand their inner workings better and enhance them accordingly.Dictionary learning is a technique that breaks down the actions of a model into many easier-to-understand parts using a special type of neural network called a sparse autoencoder. This helps researchers identify and understand the "features," or key components within the model, making it clearer how the model processes and represents different ideas."We found millions of features which appear to correspond to interpretable concepts ranging from concrete objects like people, countries, and famous buildings to abstract ideas like emotions, writing styles, and reasoning steps," the research paper states.Anthropic coded some of these features for the public. Claude is able to create connections for things like the Golden Gate Bridge (code 34M/31164353) to abstract notions such as "internal conflicts and dilemmas" (F#1M/284095), names of famous people like Albert Einstein (F#4M/1456596) and even potential safety concerns like "influence/manipulation." (F#34M/21750411).‚ÄúThe interesting thing is not that these features exist, but that they can be discovered at scale and intervened on,‚Äù Anthropic explained, ‚ÄúIn the long run, we hope that having access to features like these can be helpful for analyzing and ensuring the safety of models. For example, we might hope to reliably know whether a model is being deceptive or lying to us. Or we might hope to ensure that certain categories of very harmful behavior (e.g. helping to create bioweapons) can reliably be detected and stopped.‚ÄùIn a memo, Anthropic said that this technique helped it identify risky features and act promptly to reduce their influence.‚ÄúFor example, Anthropic researchers identified a feature corresponding to ‚Äòunsafe code,‚Äô which fires for pieces of computer code that disable security-related system features,‚Äù Anthropic explained. ‚ÄúWhen we prompt the model to continue a partially-completed line of code without artificially stimulating the ‚Äòunsafe code‚Äô feature, the model helpfully provides a safe completion to the programming function. However, when we force the ‚Äòunsafe code‚Äô feature to fire strongly, the model finishes the function with a bug that is a common cause of security vulnerabilities.‚ÄùImage: AntrhopicThis ability to manipulate features to produce different results is akin to tweaking the settings on a complex machine‚Äîor hypnotizing a person. For instance, if a language model is too ‚Äúpolitically correct,‚Äù then boosting the features that may activate its spicier side could effectively transform it into a radically different LLM, as if it had been trained from scratch. This ultimately results in a more flexible model, and an easier way of doing corrective maintenance when a bug is found.Traditionally, AI models have been seen as black boxes‚Äîhighly complex systems whose internal processes are not easily interpretable. Anthropic claims to have advanced into fully opening its model‚Äôs black box, providing a clearer view of the AI's cognitive processes.Anthropic's research is a significant step towards demystifying AI, offering a glimpse into the complex cognitive processes of these advanced models. The company shared the results on Claude because the firm owns its weights, but independent researchers could take the open weights of any other LLM and adapt this technique to fine-tune a new model or understand how these open-source models process information."We believe that understanding the inner workings of large language models like Claude is crucial for ensuring their safe and responsible use," the researchers wrote.Edited by Andrew HaywardGenerally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Here‚Äôs when Ethereum (ETH) could hit $5,000


    Ethereum (ETH) is on a bull rally amid positive expectations regarding the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States‚Äô approval of Ethereum spot ETFs and BlackRock‚Äôs (NYSE: BLK) interest in real-world assets (RWA) tokenization.



Analysts started speculating on price as the cryptocurrency market awaits further developments in exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval and BlackRock‚Äôs endeavors. Reaching $5,000 in the next few days is possible as speculation heats up, even before the awaited ETF approval.



In particular, two analysts from the private wealth management firm Bernstein forecast a 75% pump to $6,600 moving forward. According to Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra, ETH could mirror Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) gains after its ETFs‚Äô approval earlier this year. DefiLlama reported this and six other experts‚Äô opinions about Ethereum on May 22.







However, Ethereum could see some action before the forecasted $6,600 a few weeks after the effective approval, as reported. This is because cryptocurrency investors could try to price the approval firsthand, backed by other positive news.



Ethereum price analysis



In this context, it is possible that¬† ETH first tries to challenge its previous all-time high of $4,869. This could happen as Ethereum tests the $5,000 psychological resistance, right above the historical resistance.



Notably, the leading Web3 cryptocurrency shows strong momentum, according to its weekly relative strength index (RSI) of 65.18. ETH trades at $3,692 by press time.



ETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView / Finbold



Joe Lubin, co-founder of the Ethereum Foundation and founder of Consensys, is optimistic about the token‚Äôs price action.




‚ÄúExpect a ‚Äúfloodgate‚Äù of demand for Ether, which will likely lead to a supply crunch and drive prices higher. There‚Äôs going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether.‚Äù
‚Äì Joe Lubin




In the meantime, BlackRock has submitted an updated spot Ethereum ETF 19b-4 document, following the SEC‚Äôs guidance. The update addresses Ethereum staking by the funds, which BlackRock and other interested institutions state they will not engage with.







As things develop, traders and investors look forward to Ethereum price projections and a nearing $5,000 test. Still, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and emotion-driven, so everything can quickly change. Speculators must remain cautious and avoid exposure above their risk profile.

First Solar Becomes Most Valuable Solar Company Amid Rivals' Struggles, Up 13% - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our¬†website policy¬†prior to making financial decisions.



First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR), a leading American solar panel manufacturer, has surpassed its competitors to become the most valuable solar company globally. The company‚Äôs market capitalization reached an impressive $21.15 billion, overtaking China‚Äôs Sungrow Power Supply Co., which stood at $20.85 billion. This achievement comes amidst significant challenges Chinese solar firms face, including a price war and trade barriers imposed by the United States.



Chinese Rivals‚Äô Struggles and US Trade Policies



Chinese solar companies, such as Longi Green Energy Technology Co., have been grappling with the effects of a fierce price war and US trade restrictions. Longi reported a net loss of $325 million in the first quarter of 2024, starkly contrasting its $562 million profit the previous year.



The Biden administration‚Äôs tariffs on Chinese solar products and support for domestic manufacturers through the Inflation Reduction Act have played a pivotal role in bolstering First Solar‚Äôs market position. These tariffs have led to US solar panel prices being nearly three times higher than the global average.



Despite First Solar‚Äôs growing market capitalization, its production capacity still lags behind its Chinese counterparts. In 2023, First Solar produced 12 gigawatts of panels, while Jinko Solar Co. produced 79 gigawatts. However, the company‚Äôs strong financial performance and favorable stock outlook have contributed to its rising value.





First Solar Stock Gains Over 13%



As of the latest update, First Solar‚Äôs stock price stands at $240.61, having experienced a remarkable 13.44% increase over the day so far. Over the past year, the stock has traded between $123.50 and $256.78. The company‚Äôs market cap is currently $22.70 billion, with a trailing P/E ratio of 22.23 and a forward P/E of 16.03. First Solar‚Äôs price-to-book ratio is 3.29.



Regarding financial performance, First Solar boasts a profit margin of 28.75%, a return on assets of 7.18%, and a return on equity of 16.05%. The company reported revenue of $3.56 billion and a net income of $1.02 billion over the last twelve months. The stock has delivered impressive returns, with a year-to-date return of 33.61%, a one-year return of 13.10%, and three- and five-year returns of 203.16% and 290.55%, respectively.



Analysts have set price targets for First Solar ranging from $157.56 to $356.00, with a consensus recommendation of ‚ÄúStrong Buy.‚Äù The next earnings report is expected between July 25, 2024, and July 30, 2024.



Key Upgrades for First Solar (FSLR)



First Solar has recently received several notable upgrades from major financial institutions. UBS Group raised its price target from $252.00 to $270.00 and maintained a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù rating, resulting in a 2.8% increase in First Solar‚Äôs share price on the day of the announcement. Barclays increased its target price from $227.00 to $228.00, with an ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù rating, while Mizuho upped its price objective from $196.00 to $209.00, issuing a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù rating.



Morgan Stanley raised its price target from $245.00 to $248.00, maintaining an ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù rating, and Oppenheimer lifted its price objective from $269.00 to $271.00, providing an ‚Äúoutperform‚Äù rating. Jefferies Financial Group increased its price objective from $209.50 to $211.00, with a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù rating.

DOGE Skyrockets 100% in Whale Transactions Amid Dogecoin ETF Rumors


Dogecoin (DOGE), the famous meme-inspired cryptocurrency, is experiencing a surge in large transactions in the last 24 hours, indicating potential activity from major investors, or "whales."According to data from¬†IntoTheBlock, the total value of these large transactions, exceeding $100,000, nearly doubled in the past 24 hours, jumping from $1.53 billion to a staggering $3.01 billion. This translates to a significant rise in the volume of DOGE being moved by these whales, from 9.74 billion to 17.97 billion coins.This surge in whale activity coincides with growing speculation about a potential Dogecoin ETF. The recent optimism surrounding the¬†Ethereum ETF has fueled rumors that DOGE could be next in line for its own regulated investment vehicle.Source: IntoTheBlockWhy is Dogecoin ETF possible?Dogecoin appears to have several factors working in its favor for ETF approval. Unlike some other cryptocurrencies, DOGE is not suspected of being a security, its futures are already approved by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and it boasts a healthy market capitalization of $24 billion, ranking it as the eighth largest cryptocurrency.Interestingly, Billy Markus, one of the creators behind¬†Dogecoin under the pseudonym Shibetoshi Nakamoto, has even chimed in on the ETF rumor with a lighthearted "amusing" remark.¬†Whether fueled by these rumors or not, the recent surge in whale transactions suggests heightened interest in¬†DOGE, and investors are watching closely to see if this translates to a price increase.

Crypto Futures vs. Traditional Futures ‚Äì A Detailed and Comparative Analysis.

Factors to Consider While Trading in Crypto Perpetual Futures Contracts¬†
Cryptocurrency investors should consider the following factors in Crypto Futures Contracts

As a trader, you must be well aware of marketing analysis tools, including chart patterns, technical indicators, or support/resistance level. The knowledge of these tools will enhance your insight to analyse profitable trading business. You can take benefits by applying these techniques and took long or short position based upon market trends.

Set Stop Loss orders
You can also avoid the majority or the entire capital loss by applying stop loss order if the price of the asset moves adversely. The stop loss strategy ensures that the particular asset trade will be automatically closed if its price reaches the particular point. However you must also be very vigilant while the price movement is in a favorable direction to take benefit.¬† This technique is known as a discipline money management.¬†

Be Cautious About Funding Rates Fluctuations
Perpetual contracts embed a rate that is always charged every eight hours. These are also called inverse swaps. There can be no risk imbalances between buyers and sellers for exchange through funding rates. Although the interests of both buyers and sellers open matches at all times, leverage is subject to variation.

Crypto Futures Traders: What Are the 8 Common Trading Mistakes to Avoid?

The funding rate increases when the buyers long ask for greater leverage. Consequently, the fees will be covered by those buyers. This problem is particularly prevalent during bull run periods when there is typically a greater demand for longs.

ETHUSDT is an ETH/USDT perpetual futures contract priced on the BETHT Index. Each contract has a value equal to its price in Tether. The funding cost is paid and received every 8 hours. ETHUSDT uses a Premium index to calculate funding rates.¬†
The chart shows that the ETH USDT market made a bullish trend on November 10, 2023, raising its value to $2,118. After that, the market showed a slightly bearish trend and declined to $1,924 on November 17, 2023.¬†
However, it should be noted that some exchanges will allow manual selection of rates and set borrowing periods by users. This attitude is far better since unpleasant surprises are presented in this case, which will certainly occur after a large-scale buying activity.
Although perpetual futures trading is an excellent tool, it has shortcomings. Among those are stronger wicks running stop losses, inability to do staking, and the variable funding rate.
Leverage Results in More Powerful Wicks
The leverage will only lead to stronger wicks regardless of the market‚Äôs liquidity. Even though these moves usually do not result in a forced liquidation, they might run investors‚Äô stops.
Thus, the principal reason why carrying futures positions for extended periods should be shunned is the probability of errant wicks.

Learn all about perpetual futures contracts in the cryptocurrency market, from their mechanics to trading strategies, with this comprehensive article.

Futures liquidation engines use price indexes from several spot (regular) exchanges to avoid price manipulation. So, the system will close positions with insufficient margin only once an index reaches its stops.

Either way, you have a solid foundation for expanding your perpetual futures contract trading knowledge further.

Scarlett Johansson may have a case in OpenAI voice dispute


While Protos usually covers Sam Altman when he‚Äôs launching cryptocurrencies or scanning eyeballs, OpenAI and its CEO have recently made waves for other reasons: namely, it appears as though Altman and his team reached out to actress Scarlett Johansson, asked for her to be a voice for OpenAI, were refused permission, and chose to pursue a similar voice actor to create the voice instead.
AI advocates have been quick to suggest that, because it wasn‚Äôt Johansson herself, there would be no room for a possible lawsuit against OpenAI. As it turns out, things may not be that simple.
Indeed, there are many cases that suggest Johansson would not only have a case but would likely win.

Bette Midler v Ford Motor Company
In 1985, an advertising agency made a series of commercials for the Ford Lincoln Mercury that utilized hit music from the ‚Äò70s but almost exclusively relied on sound-alike singers. One of these songs was Do You Want To Dance from Bette Midler‚Äôs album The Divine Miss M. Apparently, a brief phone interaction between the ad agency and Midler‚Äôs agent went as follows:
Ad Agent: Hello, I am Craig Hazen from Young and Rubicam. I am calling you to find out if Bette Midler would be interested in doing . . .?
Midler‚Äôs Agent: Is it a commercial?
Ad Agent: Yes.
Midler‚Äôs Agent: We are not interested.
The ad agency already had a license from the copyright holder to use the song and had a sound-alike sing it for the ad. Midler was alerted to it when ‚Äòa number of people‚Äô reached out to her to say it sounded exactly like her. A lawsuit followed.
Midler lost the initial case but won on appeal.
Importantly, the court asked, ‚ÄúWhy did the defendants ask Midler to sing if her voice was not of value to them? Why did they studiously acquire the services of a sound-alike and instruct her to imitate Midler if Midler‚Äôs voice was not of value to them?‚Äù It then answered those questions in the next sentence, stating ‚ÄúWhat they sought was an attribute of Midler‚Äôs identity. Its value was what the market would have paid for Midler to have sung the commercial in person.‚Äù
While the case revolved around a singer, her song, and the use of both in an ad, it wasn‚Äôt those aspects that won her the case. Most importantly the court said ‚ÄúTo impersonate her voice is to pirate her identity.‚Äù
Tom Waits v Frito-Lay
While Midler had the fact that she was a superstar and that the advertising agency had reached out to her representative and asked her to sing on her side in her court case, Tom Waits had no such advantages.
In his case against Frito-Lay, Waits sued the chip manufacturer for creating a radio jingle that sounded exactly like him.
Although no one from the ad agency reached out to Waits or his representatives, they did a ‚Äòsearch for a lead singer for the commercial [that] suggests that no one would do but a singer who could not only capture the feeling of [Tom Waits‚Äô 1976 song] Step Right Up but also imitate Tom Waits‚Äô voice.‚Äô
The ad agency found a Waits impersonator and hired him to sing a song about Doritos. A video by Rock N‚Äô Roll True Stories plays the embarrassing fake Tom Waits Frito Lay radio commercial here.
In the lead-up to the first airing of the ad, Frito-Lay reached out to the ad agency to ask if they could get sued for releasing it. The attorney for the ad agency said ‚Äúthere was a ‚Äòhigh-profile‚Äô risk of a lawsuit in view of recent case law recognizing the protectability of a distinctive voice,‚Äù adding ‚Äúbased on what Grossman had told him, however, the attorney did not think such a suit would have merit, because a singer‚Äôs style of music is not protected.‚Äù
Unfortunately for the ad agency lawyers, a jury decided in Waits‚Äô favor even though they didn‚Äôt know of him and ‚Äòthought [he] was a criminal‚Äô the first time they saw him. Frito-Lay appealed.
Waits won on appeal, with the Ninth Circuit reaffirming almost all of the jury‚Äôs decisions, including his award for punitive damages of $2 million.
Vanna White v Samsung Electronics America
Wheel of Fortune hostess Vanna White sued Samsung for an ad it ran that featured a robot game show hostess. While it didn‚Äôt use her voice or name, it wore an outfit like White‚Äôs on Wheel of Fortune.
It turns out that even that was enough to win a court case.
The appeals court stated, ‚ÄúThe right of publicity does not require that appropriations of identity be accomplished through particular means to be actionable,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúif we treated the means of appropriation as dispositive in our analysis of the right of publicity, we would not only weaken the right but effectively eviscerate it.‚Äù
Read more: Opinion: Americans shouldn‚Äôt offer their eyeballs to WorldCoin
Honorable mention: Crispin Glover v Universal Pictures
Famously, Crispin Glover turned down a part in Back to the Future Part II because he didn‚Äôt like the script. But that didn‚Äôt stop Universal Pictures from using old footage, prosthetics, and face masks to recreate him in the Back to the Future sequel, and that pissed Glover off.
Upon receiving the lawsuit, Universal filed a demurrer arguing that ‚Äòthe publicity rights claim should fail because the filmmakers were only trying to perpetuate the George McFly character.‚Äô This argument was rejected by the judge and, ultimately, the case was settled in (presumably) Glover‚Äôs favor.
Not federal law
Of course, none of these cases were taken to the Supreme Court in the US, and right to publicity has largely been decided state-by-state, so no one knows what could transpire on a federal level. It‚Äôs possible that Johansson doesn‚Äôt attempt to take OpenAI on for their misuse of a voice, particularly as it was quickly pulled.
While the demo video of the new OpenAI used Johansson-modelled ‚ÄòSky‚Äô voice, it‚Äôs unclear if this is enough to seek punitive damages or if Johansson is interested in spending years of time litigating against Microsoft and OpenAI.
Regardless, this marks a watershed moment where actors, artists, writers, and other creators will need to see how far they‚Äôre willing to let artificial intelligence go before it crosses the line on their rights to privacy and publicity.

U.S. Congressman warns CBDCs 'threaten to destroy the American way of life‚Äô


    Congressman Tom Emmer spoke in the House of Representatives against Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), warning they are surveillance tools. Emmer has been against the U.S. current CBDC project for a while and is now doubling down on his stance.



Notably, the Congressman‚Äôs most recent appearance was in a video shared through his official X account on May 22. Before that, Tom Emmer gave an interview to Bloomberg on May 20, addressing a similar stance. According to him, the House of Republicans will take action to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC.



In this most recent speech, the U.S. Congressman warned CBDCs ‚Äúthreaten to destroy the American way of life.‚Äù This was said while Tom Emmer presented the ‚ÄúCBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act.‚Äù








‚ÄúWith this legislation, we are going to stop unelected bureaucrats in the Biden Administration from using a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), that threatens to destroy the American way of life.‚Äù
‚Äì Tom Emmer








Congressman Tom Emmer: CBDCs must be like cash



Interestingly, Emmer continued his speech by comparing CBDCs with decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and mentioning the properties of the competing tools.




‚ÄúUnlike decentralized digital assets such as Bitcoin, CBDCs are a digital form of a sovereign currency designed, issued, and monitored by the Federal Government. In short, a CBDC is a government-controlled, programable money that, if not designed to be just like cash‚Äîopen, permissionless, and Private (with a capital P)‚Äîit not only could it will give the federal government significant transaction-level data and individuals an ability to suppress politically unpopular activity.‚Äù
‚Äì Tom Emmer




The Congressman mentioned the example of China weaponizing its Central Bank Digital Currency against its citizens, besides other countries. Moreover, Tom Emmer warned about a Federal Reserve document highlighting CBDCs as one of their key duties moving forward.



‚ÄúIn doing this, the Biden Administration has proven they are itching to trade Americans‚Äô right to privacy for a CCP-style CBDC surveillance tool,‚Äù concluded the U.S. Representative.



However, he explained that the ‚ÄúCBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act‚Äù will not prevent a CBDC from existing. The bill aims to ensure that the centralized monetary system can maintain cash‚Äôs attributes as permissionless and ‚ÄúPrivate (with a capital P)‚Äù and guarantee individual sovereignty.

There's Been A Serious Pump In Big Memecoin: Two Whales Bought Hours Earlier - Bitcoin Sistemi

In days when a very enthusiastic atmosphere prevails in the cryptocurrency market, memecoins do not stop their upward movements.
As it is known, it is almost certain that the SEC will approve Ethereum Spot ETFs, and the final decision date for these ETFs is tomorrow.


As the possibility of approval increased, almost all memecoins, especially PEPE, were positively affected.
Today, the significant rise of a memecoin attracts attention in the cryptocurrency market. The altcoin named Dogwifhat (WIF) experienced a significant rally during the day, rising from $ 2.71 to over $ 3.20.





Graph showing the rise in WIF price.
Whales did not sit idle during the rise of WIF. According to Onchain data, two cryptocurrency whales seem to have benefited from this rise.

The first whale, with short address 37reKQ, purchased 453,877 WIF tokens at $2.89, paying $1.31 million. Then, with the rally in WIF, the unrealized profit level of the whale is around 161 thousand dollars at the time of writing this article.


The second whale with short address 8rWUUy used $730 thousand SOL to buy 247,791 WIFs at $2.95 and currently holds a total of $4.5 million WIF.
Both whales are currently profitable, but PEPE's performance has been superior to WIF so far, even accounting for WIF's recent rise. One of the reasons for this may be that PEPE is Ethereum-based while WIF is Solana-based. There is a lot of hype in the Ethereum ecosystem right now due to ETFs.

Azuki 'Satoshi Nakamoto' Hoodie Is Tokenized on Both Bitcoin and Ethereum - Decrypt

Ethereum NFT project Azuki and multi-chain marketplace Magic Eden have teamed up to create what they‚Äôre calling the first dual-chain NFT product that exists on both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains‚Äîa limited edition hoodie inspired by the creator of Bitcoin, represented by an NFT on both chains.The Azuki x Satoshi Nakamoto Enduro Hoodie, first revealed last fall, was created exclusively for holders of Azuki's "Spirits" NFTs‚Äîso there are just 98 pieces in total. The hoodies serve as a tribute to Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.Each hoodie contains an embedded chip that allows owners to scan it and mint a corresponding NFT as proof of ownership and authenticity on Ethereum‚Äîbut also an NFT-like Ordinals inscription on Bitcoin.The hoodies utilize Azuki‚Äôs own Physical Backed Token (PBT) technology per the Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP-5791 standard. Ownership transfers require a signature from the physical chip embedded in each hoodie, creating what Azuki calls ‚Äúdecentralized on-chain verification combined with off-chain ownership."‚ÄúThe ownership on ETH is still tied to immutable art on BTC,‚Äù Azuki and Magic Eden noted in a statement. ‚ÄúThe concept was built around the desire to collect and trade artifacts in a user-friendly way, which led to programming on EVM while keeping the art enshrined on BTC.‚ÄùAzuki is one of the most prominent NFT properties, with more than $1.1 billion to date worth of trading volume for its original Ethereum collection alone, per CryptoSlam.Magic Eden has been the leading NFT marketplace by trading volume in recent months, thanks in part to its early bet on Bitcoin Ordinals.

Ripple Vs. SEC Lawsuit: Latest Filing Marks Beginning Of The End Of Historic Battle | Bitcoinist.com


								The long-running legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple is one step closer to an end with the Commission‚Äôs latest filing. The court is expected to give its judgment soon enough, as both parties have filed all necessary briefs.¬†
What The SEC‚Äôs Latest Filing Is About
The Commission filed a letter in opposition to Ripple‚Äôs motion to seal certain documents related to the remedies stage. In line with an earlier report, the SEC noted that they weren‚Äôt opposing Ripple‚Äôs requests in its entirety. For the opposed redactions, the Commission argued that the crypto firm had failed to ‚Äúovercome the strong presumption that court filings should be public.‚Äù

The regulator mentioned that the materials they oppose a redaction are ‚Äúfundamental to the rationale behind the SEC‚Äôs requested remedies.‚Äù The SEC further noted that Ripple had invited the public to form an opinion about the merits of the Commission‚Äôs positions. As such, the crypto firm cannot ‚Äúsimultaneously hide‚Äù from the public the evidence on which the SEC‚Äôs position is based.¬†
Furthermore, the SEC claimed that Ripple‚Äôs argument that failure to redact these documents could harm its business doesn‚Äôt eliminate the burden of proof on the crypto firm to show ‚Äúexceptional circumstances‚Äù that justify sealing or redacting. Ripple had also cited earlier instances in the case where the court agreed to certain requests for sealing and redactions.¬†
However, the Commission claims it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äújustify‚Äù Ripple‚Äôs requests as it tried to differentiate those earlier events from the case at hand. Firstly, they noted that the court‚Äôs earlier rulings regarding redactions were ‚Äúin the context of specific filings, not for the rest of the case.‚Äù Unlike then, the financial information and offering terms the firm seeks to seal ‚Äúis now at the crux of the remedies decision,‚Äù the SEC remarked.¬†
Secondly, the SEC argued that the documents that Ripple seeks to seal are ones which it would have been legally mandated to disclose in the first place since the court had already ruled that the firm‚Äôs institutional sales were investment contracts. Lastly, the Commission argued that these documents were already ‚Äústale‚Äù and there was no need to hide them.¬†
When Is A Final Judgment Expected For Ripple?
Judge Analisa Torres is expected to give her final judgment soon enough since both parties have filed all their respective briefs according to the scheduling order. However, before then, the Judge will need to rule on Ripple‚Äôs sealing motion and decide whether or not the crypto firm‚Äôs financial information should be made public.¬†

Following the ruling, Ripple will have fourteen days to file a public or redacted version (depending on the court‚Äôs ruling) of the documents in question. After this has been done, the court can then proceed to give its final judgment. The SEC has proposed that Judge Torres order a fine against Ripple summing up to almost $2 billion.
Meanwhile, Ripple has opposed the proposed remedies and asked that the court limit any proposed fine to just $10 million.¬†

What a Potential Ethereum Spot ETF Could Mean for Cryptocurrencies?

It goes without saying that cryptocurrency and digital asset adoption has reached an inflection point. The recent approval of several Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the United States marked a significant milestone for Bitcoin and the entire crypto market as a whole.

Last year, we speculated on the prospect of these approvals and what impact it could have on the markets.¬†

Since the approvals in January, the cryptocurrency markets have entered a raging bull market with increased deliberation among the mainstream media. This week, we see yet another turning point towards widespread adoption with the chatter of the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) potentially approving several Ethereum Spot ETFs amidst a political backdrop in the US that is becoming increasingly crypto-friendly.¬†
Even though rumors of the Ethereum Spot ETF have been floating around for months, it wasn‚Äôt until this week when real traction grew. The SEC began actively engaging with issuers and national exchanges, mirroring the approach taken prior to the approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETFs. This blog explores what an approval could bring to Ethereum, altcoins and the cryptocurrency sector as a whole over the short term and long term.¬†

The SEC‚Äôs Stance on Ethereum¬†
The second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has been in the crossfire with the United States‚Äô SEC for years. Ever since Ethereum‚Äôs transition from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS) in 2022, the SEC under the helm of Gary Gensler has been maneuvering to classify Ethereum as a security rather than a commodity. Shortly after the Merge, Gary Gensler stated that tokens in a PoS consensus system could be considered securities since investors rely on the efforts of others to make a profit. 
Classifying Ethereum as a security poses significant drawbacks for the crypto market. Such a designation would subject Ethereum to stringent regulatory requirements, potentially stifling innovation and deterring investment. 
The increased compliance costs and legal uncertainties could hinder the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and other blockchain-based technologies built on the Ethereum network. 
Furthermore, it might prompt exchanges to delist Ethereum to avoid the complexities of trading securities, reducing its liquidity and accessibility for investors. This regulatory shift could create a ripple effect, impacting the broader crypto ecosystem and slowing the adoption of blockchain technology.¬†
In early 2024, the SEC began investigating Ethereum, issuing subpoenas to U.S. entities connected to the Ethereum Foundation. This move raised questions about whether it is part of a broader effort to classify ether as a security, possibly slashing hopes that the regulator will approve Ethereum Spot ETFs. Until last week, this mounting bearish stance pushed the odds of an Ethereum spot ETF being approved to 10%.¬†

Over the past week, however, the SEC has seemingly done a 180 on their stance on Ethereum. On Monday, news that the SEC had informed exchanges the agency was leaning towards approving Ethereum spot ETFs shook the world of cryptocurrencies.¬† 
Possible Impact of an Approval¬†
Price Appreciation
While the decision on the Ethereum Spot ETF‚Äôs to be authorized is still pending, it is interesting to speculate on some of the scenarios that could take place. One such is an Ethereum price surge. This scenario has in fact already taken place. Since the news broke, Ethereum‚Äôs price rallied a staggering 20% in a single day.¬†

Some on twitter are also of the opinion that the news has not been priced in. Others view the break of structure as an indicator of the start of a longer-term parabolic bull market.¬†

To understand market sentiment and the characteristics that typify a crypto bull and bear market, read this article: Bull and Bear Markets Explained: A Guide to Maximizing Profits in Crypto 



Even though predicting short term price swings can be difficult, the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price following its ETF approvals may signal similar trends for Ethereum.¬†
An Altcoin Season¬†
An approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs could potentially trigger an altcoin season by significantly boosting investor confidence in the broader cryptocurrency market. Ethereum, as the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, holds a pivotal role in the crypto ecosystem. Its recognition and validation through a spot ETF would likely attract a wave of institutional and retail investment.¬†
This influx of capital could not only drive up the price of Ethereum but also increase interest in other altcoins, as investors look to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the broader market momentum. 
Historically, major developments and positive regulatory news for bluechip cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have had a cascading effect, lifting the entire market.¬†

Read this article for an introductory guide on what altcoins are and their different types: A Brief Overview of Altcoins: What are Their Types, Pros and Cons¬†

Moreover, an Ethereum Spot ETF approval could pave the way for a broader trend of crypto ETFs gaining regulatory approval. Established protocols like Solana are already being speculated as the next candidates for such recognition.¬†


Increased Institutional Adoption¬†
One possible scenario following the approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF is a significant increase in institutional adoption of Ethereum. With a spot ETF, traditional financial institutions such as mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds would have a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of directly purchasing and storing the cryptocurrency. 
This could lead to a substantial influx of institutional capital into the market, which would not only drive up the price of Ethereum but also enhance its legitimacy as a mainstream investment asset.¬†
We have already seen this play out with the Bitcoin ETFs with large hedge funds accumulating the digital asset at unprecedented rates.¬†

Easier Accessibility
Ethereum Spot ETFs will significantly enhance accessibility for people interested in investing in cryptocurrencies without having to navigate the complex technicalities of the Web3 ecosystem. 
Traditionally, investing in Ethereum requires a basic understanding of setting up crypto wallets, managing private keys, and purchasing the asset via cryptocurrency exchanges‚Äîall of which can be challenging for those unfamiliar with this space. With the introduction of Ethereum Spot ETFs, investors can bypass these hurdles. 

Read this article for an end-to-end guide on cryptocurrency wallets: Cryptocurrency Wallets: Explained

These ETFs, traded on traditional stock exchanges, offer a familiar and regulated investment vehicle that simplifies the process. This ease of access means that anyone with a brokerage account can gain exposure to Ethereum just as easily as they would with stocks or conventional ETFs.
The availability of Ethereum Spot ETFs will diversify the investor base by attracting people who use legacy investment platforms. By offering a product that fits within the existing framework of traditional finance, Ethereum Spot ETFs open the market to a broader audience, including institutional investors, retirement funds, and everyday individuals who prefer the security and simplicity of regulated financial products.¬†
Closing Thoughts 
The prospect of an Ethereum Spot ETF approval stands to significantly shake up the crypto sector, with both short-term and long-term implications. The approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs would mark a pivotal step towards mainstream adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into the global financial system. 
While the decision for approval remains to be seen at the time of this writing, the mere possibility and the precedent set by approved Bitcoin ETFs speak volumes about the progress and maturation of the cryptocurrency industry since its inception 15 years ago. 
The journey of digital assets from a niche investment opportunity to a significant component of the financial landscape underscores its transformative potential and the capacity to redefine financial paradigms.

MetaMask set to integrate native Bitcoin functionality - CoinJournal



                    

                    
MetaMask integrating native Bitcoin support, bridging Ethereum-Bitcoin gap.
Although no exact timelines, the integration is expected within a month.
Currently, MetaMask uses Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) to bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum‚Äôs decentralized applications.

MetaMask, renowned as the most-used Ethereum (ETH) wallet, is poised to transcend one of the biggest tribal divides in the crypto sphere by extending support to Bitcoin (BTC).
The move, anticipated within the next month, will mark a significant step towards interoperability in the ever-expanding world of cryptocurrencies.
This news comes at the backdrop of Metamask‚Äôs integration¬†with Coinbase Onramp allowing Coinbase users with an active Coinbase account to seamlessly buy and transfer crypto directly to their MetaMask wallet by selecting the Coinbase Pay option.
Bitcoin addition part of MetaMask‚Äôs multi-chain approach
This development underscores MetaMask‚Äôs commitment to embracing a multi-chain approach in the Web3 landscape.
Currently, MetaMask does not directly facilitate Bitcoin transactions but utilizes Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), an Ethereum-compatible ERC-20 token, to bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum‚Äôs decentralized applications.
However, the forthcoming integration of native Bitcoin functionality within MetaMask holds the potential to streamline user interactions across different blockchain ecosystems, fostering greater interoperability and expanding the utility of both Ethereum and Bitcoin for users worldwide.
With over 30 million monthly active users, MetaMask serves as a vital gateway into the world of decentralized applications (dApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain.
As Ethereum continues to pioneer innovations like smart contracts, MetaMask has played a crucial role in facilitating user navigation within this smart contract-based environment.
Now, with plans to incorporate Bitcoin functionality, MetaMask is poised to broaden its utility and appeal to a wider audience of cryptocurrency enthusiasts.
No exact timeline for the integration
While the exact timeline for the integration remains uncertain, sources familiar with the matter suggest that access to native Bitcoin functionality could arrive within the MetaMask platform in the coming month.
However, the specific features and capabilities of Bitcoin support are yet to be finalized. It is anticipated that initial functionalities may be limited, with expansions and enhancements rolled out gradually over time.
MetaMask‚Äôs parent company, ConsenSys, led by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, has expressed excitement about the prospect of embracing the multi-chain world of Web3.
A spokesperson for MetaMask emphasized the company‚Äôs ongoing commitment to enhancing usability and security while exploring new integrated features for its self-custodial wallet.

House of Representatives To Vote on Major Crypto Bill by the End of This Week - Here‚Äôs What It‚Äôs About - The Daily Hodl


								The U.S. House of Representatives is gearing up to vote on a major crypto bill that aims to clarify how digital assets are regulated.
The bipartisan ‚ÄúFinancial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act‚Äù would empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to regulate crypto assets as commodities if the blockchain they run on is sufficiently decentralized.










The bill says decentralized blockchains can‚Äôt be controlled unilaterally by any one person. The potential legislation also states that no issuer or affiliated person can control 20% or more of the digital assets or the voting power of a decentralized chain.
Digital assets associated with blockchains that aren‚Äôt decentralized would be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as securities.
Eight Republicans and three Democrats have sponsored the bill, which is widely expected to go to a vote this week.
The Blockchain Association, a crypto lobbying group, has expressed support for the potential legislation, and a16z Crypto, the digital asset investment arm of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, says the act would ‚Äúgive blockchain projects a pathway to safely and effectively launch‚Äù in the United States.
House Democratic leaders don‚Äôt plan to whip against the bill but have expressed their opposition to the potential legislation, according to a report from Politico journalist Eleanor Mueller.
In an email sent to Democratic House members, the party leadership argues that the bill ‚Äúundermines decades of legal precedent and case law, thereby creating uncertainty in our traditional securities market.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe bill also provides a safe harbor in which entities can file an ‚Äúintent to register‚Äù if they meet certain requirements, effectively shielding them from SEC rules and regulations until SEC and CFTC finalize their rules, which weakens investor protections and opens the door to fraud and market manipulation.‚Äù

The Protocol: EIGEN Riches Tempt Ethereum Devs, Even as ETF Approval Nears

MEV SNIPING! It's not clear exactly what started it all, but top Ethereum developers locked horns on the social-media platform X, in an intense and almost uncomfortable-to-observe debate touching on the practice of maximal extractable value, or MEV ‚Äì essentially, the use of sophisticated trading bots to frontrun user transactions at the point of execution. On May 16, Ethereum core developer P√©ter Szil√°gyi tweeted about his despair over the lack of progress in pushing to solve some of the blockchain's most vexing issues. "Voila, the banking system recreated," he wrote. One of his points was that Ethereum had "glorified" MEV, remarking, ostensibly in sarcasm, that it was "futile to fight against MEV, so might as well lean hard on it, right?" (As chronicled in last week's issue of The Protocol, even U.S. government officials now appear to characterize MEV as standard operating procedure on the blockchain.) Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist retweeted Szil√°gyi's post with the comment, "This is such a lazy take if you can't also tell me what your supposed solutions are that let local block producers extract MEV." A back-and-forth ensued, and then Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin chimed in, tweeting that "I'm really proud that Ethereum does not have any culture of trying to prevent people from speaking their minds, even when they have very negative feelings toward major things in the protocol or ecosystem." Buterin, who is known to write long, interrupted his work on a project in Kenya to bang out a 3,000-word-plus essay breaking down the issues, concluding: "I also do not think that the situation is anywhere near as hopeless as Peter's tweets imply."

Good News from the USA to Binance! The Court Cancelled the Prohibition Decision! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Good news came from the USA for Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.
According to Bloomberg, the Florida Court of Appeals overturned the Binance ban.


Accordingly, the First District Court of Appeal in Florida overturned the ban on Binance on May 22 with a unanimous decision.
In its decision, the court said state regulators did not follow proper procedures when banning Binance in November 2023.





The court ruled that Binance's operations in the state could not be blocked under the emergency cease-and-desist order issued by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation.
The Court of Appeals also stated that the Florida Office of Financial Regulation did not consider CZ's conduct to be grounds for suspending the license of Binance's Florida subsidiary.


Florida regulators' decision to suspend Binance came after former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges.

Is Donald Trump Accepting Crypto Donations 'Just Another Cow For Him To Milk?' - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump is now accepting cryptocurrency for official campaign donations, a move that has garnered mixed reactions from experts in the crypto industry. While some see this as a strategic play to attract crypto enthusiasts, others remain skeptical about Trump‚Äôs genuine commitment to the sector.Experts Split On Trump's Move To Accept Crypto DonationsDavid Hoffman, Co-owner at Bankless, dismissed the significance of Trump‚Äôs move, stating, ‚ÄúI'm not going to celebrate Donald Trump accepting crypto donations. It's trivial. Thinking it's ‚Äòembracing the industry' is naive. Trump has not shown any true commitment to crypto. So far, we are just another cow for him to milk.‚ÄùIn contrast, Ryan Selkis, founder & CEO at Messari Crypto, views Trump's acceptance of crypto donations more positively.‚ÄúYou can now support the first pro-crypto major presidential candidate, President Trump‚Ä¶with crypto,‚Äù Selkis said, adding, ‚ÄúLiz had an army. We have a hulk.‚ÄùSelkis also highlighted Trump's recent influence on the crypto market and regulatory environment, noting, ‚ÄúIn one week, [Trump] sparked a $200 billion+ crypto market rally, forced Senate Dems into submission on SAB 121, forced the resignation of the FDIC Chair, forced the SEC to reverse course on its ETF approval, and upped FIT 21 odds of passage.‚ÄùThe Shift To Crypto Donations: Strategic Move Or Token Gesture?In early May, Trump indicated his support for the cryptocurrency sector, announcing that his campaign would begin accepting crypto donations.‚ÄúIf you like crypto in any form‚Ä¶if you‚Äôre in favor of crypto you‚Äôd better vote for Trump,‚Äù the former president remarked at the time.Also Read: Ethereum ETF Launch Potentially Still Weeks Away, Says Bloomberg AnalystTrump Campaign First Major Party To Embrace Crypto DonationsOn Tuesday, Trump's presidential election campaign became the first major party campaign to accept cryptocurrency donations. A statement from the campaign reads, ‚ÄúThis addition to President Trump‚Äôs already groundbreaking digital fundraising operation marks the first time a major party Presidential nominee has embraced cryptocurrencies for donations.‚ÄùThe fundraising initiative adheres to Federal Election Commission regulations and will accept any cryptocurrency currently supported by Coinbase Commerce, including Bitcoin BTC/USD, Ethereum ETH/USD, Solana SOL/USD, Tether USDT/USD, Rippple XRP/USD, Dogecoin DOGE/USD, Cardano ADA/USD, Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, and Avalanche AVAX/USD.Eric.eth commented on the broader political landscape, "It AMAZES me that people in crypto are still out here defending Biden. The guy has outright assaulted our industry for 4 years. ‚ÄòYa but Trump may change tone once elected' is max cope. No proof whatsoever that‚Äôs true. Are you people OK? Blink twice if you need help."Comparing Crypto Strategies: Trump vs. KennedyTrump‚Äôs decision to accept cryptocurrency donations comes as a strategic move to attract crypto-friendly voters, particularly as independent competitor Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been accepting Bitcoin donations for months. This effort is seen as a counter to the anti-crypto stance of President Joe Biden and several Democratic leaders, including Senator Elizabeth Warren.The campaign website promotes Trump's stance on new technologies, stating, ‚ÄúTrump stands ready to embrace new technologies that will Make America Great Again.‚ÄùIt further emphasizes Trump‚Äôs track record in reducing regulations and supporting financial innovation, contrasting it with the Democratic approach of more stringent government controls.Political And Market ImpactAs Trump's campaign aims to build a ‚Äúcrypto army‚Äù to secure victory in the 2024 election, this move could significantly influence the cryptocurrency market and its regulatory landscape. Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and ConsenSys, remarked, ‚ÄúThe resulting ‚Äòfloodgate' of demand for Ether will likely lead to a supply crunch. There's going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether.‚ÄùThe broader implications of this development, including regulatory trends and market dynamics, will be explored at Benzinga‚Äôs Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19. Industry leaders, investors, and policymakers will gather to discuss the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape.Read Next: Bitcoin Spot ETFs See Seventh Straight Day Of Inflows With $306MImage created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Bitcoin Market Not 'Top Heavy' Yet But More Consolidation Expected: Analysts


																BTC prices have retreated back below $70,000 during Wednesday morning‚Äôs Asian trading session but markets are not overbought yet, according to analyst James Check.
‚ÄúRight now, using a variety of volume metrics as the input, BTC prices appear to be right in line with the fundamentals,‚Äù he said in a newsletter on May 21.
Moreover, the market looks like it did in late-2020, he added.
In early December 2020, BTC prices rose to reclaim its 2017 all-time high of $20,000. It consolidated around this level for a couple of weeks before surging to a new peak of $30,000 by New Year‚Äôs Day.


History Rhyming?
During this recent cycle, BTC prices have climbed to almost reclaim their mid-March peak of $73,738 but have found resistance there, indicating positive momentum and potential for entering price discovery territory.




‚ÄúOnly seven days in all history have a closing price above this [$71,000], so we are really breathing thin air up here,‚Äù said the analyst.
He added that ‚Äúpunching a convincing all-time-high is rarely successful on the first go‚Äù before stating that a period of ‚Äúchopping wood‚Äù and a couple of significant attempts is very normal.
Moreover, the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio suggests that bitcoin‚Äôs price is in line with its on-chain transaction throughput, similar to the conditions seen during late 2020.
Additionally, the short-term holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) shows that the market is in an ‚Äúenthusiastic‚Äù but not ‚Äúeuphoric‚Äù phase, indicating a potentially sustainable uptrend.
This is a condition in which a significant number of holders are caught off guard and buy too many coins at too high a price.
The Glassnode analyst also mentions a ‚Äútop-heavy‚Äù market condition, where a significant number of investors are holding assets at a loss. However, he notes that this condition has improved significantly, with only 6.6% of the short-term holder supply now held at a loss, reducing the risk of panic selling.
More Chopsolidation Ahead
On May 21, fellow analyst ‚ÄúRekt Capital‚Äù predicted that a weekly candle close above $71,500 ‚Äúwould probably kickstart the breakout from the re-accumulation range.‚Äù¬†However, BTC prices had already dipped to $69,782 at the time of writing.
He added that history suggests BTC should consolidate inside this re-accumulation range for several weeks more.

5 Stocks Orbiting Nvidia's Earnings Report Today - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our¬†website policy¬†prior to making financial decisions.



When Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) released its earnings report in February for (fiscal) Q4 ‚Äò24, it significantly impacted other tech stocks. Having exceeded expectations and outperformed in data center revenue, the chipmaker bumped the NASDAQ 100 (NDX) index by 3% into the next day.



This is not surprising with Nvidia‚Äôs current market cap gravity pull of $2.38 trillion. Having started the year with $1.22 trillion, this is an impressive 95% growth of value. Effectively, NVDA stock became a proxy for all things related to generative AI infrastructure, although AMD‚Äôs MI300X chips are heading to be more cost effective.



After the market closes on May 22nd, Nvidia is scheduled to release the earnings report for fiscal Q1 2025, ending April 2024. Considering Nvidia‚Äôs heavy gravity, let‚Äôs look at five stocks that are directly involved with the company or could be lifted by Nvidia‚Äôs AI tide.¬†



SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN)



Notwithstanding Nvidia‚Äôs disclosure of 1.73 million SOUN shares at the end of 2023, SoundHound AI is a sound investor choice in its own right. The Santa Clara startup leverages the need for natural voice interfacing powered by machine learning.¬†



Alongside food chains like White Castle and Krispy Kreme, SoundHound‚Äôs AI-powered voice systems found themselves in leading auto brands under the Stellantis umbrella, including Kia, Hyundai, and Honda. Owing to the NVIDIA DRIVE framework, SoundHound is working toward AI interactions without cloud connectivity.



In February‚Äôs earnings for Q1, the company reported a 73% YoY revenue growth. Although still delivering a $33 million net loss, SoundHound ended the quarter with $226 million net cash. Year-to-date, SOUN stock is up 147% at present $5.14 per share. Nasdaq‚Äôs average SOUN price target is $7.17 per share.



Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU as ADS)



Before US export controls on AI chips, Chinese Baidu was a major source of revenue for Nvidia. The company is still a major AI player since shifting to Huawei‚Äôs 910B Ascend and its own Kunlun chips.¬†



Both Baidu and Alibaba recently cut prices on their large-language model as the AI cloud-compute wars heat up in China. In a bid to corner the market, Baidu‚Äôs Ernie Speed and Ernie Lite LLMs are now free for business accounts.¬†



The company‚Äôs income stream is stable owing to ad revenue and subscription services like Netflix. In May, for Q1 2024, Baidu reported 7% net income growth and 25% YoY growth for its Apollo Go, an autonomous ride-hailing service.¬†



Year-to-date, BIDU has tracked a negative 10% performance at $103.50 per share price. Given Nasdaq‚Äôs forecasted average BIDU price target of $155.06 per share, this makes for a very strong upswing potential.





Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM as ADS)



In a different timeline, this British semiconductor company would operate under Nvidia. But after failing to acquire Arm for $40 billion in 2020, Nvidia settled for a minor $147.3 million stake. Arm is a highly attractive asset, considering its over 90% market share in the mobile applications market.



Rather than manufacturing chips, Arm relies on design licensing for its revenue. According to a Nikkei report, the company is set to launch AI chips by spring 2025, contracting with various manufacturers for mass production. This will be a boon to suppliers looking to wean off of Nvidia.



ARM stock is up 65% year-to-date. Wall Street Journal‚Äôs aggregated forecast puts the average ARM price target at $118.81 vs. the current $114.30 per share, with a high potential of $195.



Nano-X Imaging (NASDAQ: NNOX)



Nvidia‚Äôs stake in this startup of $380k was a leftover from Nano-X acquiring Zebra Medical, which Nvidia invested in 2017. Nonetheless, Nano-X got into the public spotlight aiming to reduce healthcare costs with AI solutions.



Specifically, to leverage Digital Tomosynthesis imaging tech to break the barrier for complex and expensive scanning and diagnosis. Combined with Nanox.ARC, the company‚Äôs ecosystem to make it happen, is facilitated by Nanox.AI and Nanox.Cloud.¬†



Nano-X is scheduled to release its Q1 2024 report on May 28th. Previously, the company reported $10.2 million net loss, which was a significant reduction from $52.8 million net loss in a year-ago quarter. Year-to-date, NNOX stock is up 40%. Nasdaq‚Äôs average NNOX price target is $16 vs current $9 per share.¬†







Mobileye Global (NASDAQ: MBLY)



Mobileye‚Äôs claim to fame is its camera sensor, which facilitates ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance Systems) technology. The company‚Äôs latest iteration is Mobileye EYEQ6 Lite, which collaborates closely with the Volkswagen Group.¬†



The Israel-based company directly competes with Nvidia, having noted in 2019 that ‚ÄúNvidia must think very highly of us,‚Äù referring to Nvidia‚Äôs Safety Force Field (SFF). Mobileye CEO construed Nvidia‚Äôs document as heavily influenced by Mobileye‚Äôs own Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) published in 2017.



In April, Mobileye delivered Q1 earnings, showing a 48% YoY revenue decline and a $218 million net loss vs. a $79 million net loss in the year-ago quarter. However, Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua is still optimistic, forecasting fully autonomous vehicles hitting the roads in 2026.



With its heavy presence in Israel, investors should note that Intel (INTC) also has a stake in Mobileye. As of February, Intel CEO Gelsinger alone owned 66,386 MBLY shares, alongside 456k shares across trusts. Since Intel is one of the main beneficiaries of the CHIPS Act, aiming to become the world‚Äôs second-largest chipmaker after TSMC, long-term Mobileye investments are likely.



Year-to-date, MBLY shares are down 33%. At $27.66, Nasdaq‚Äôs average MBLY price target of $38 per share creates a high profit potential. The upper forecasting ceiling for MBLY stock twelve months ahead is $53 per share.¬†

Zacks Investment Ideas Feature Highlights: Coinbase, Robinhood, Reddit, GameStop and MicroStrategy - Coinbase Glb (NASDAQ:COIN) - Benzinga

For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL ‚Äì May 22, 2024 ‚Äì Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Coinbase, Robinhood Markets, Reddit, GameStop and MicroStrategy.3 Crypto-Related Stocks to Buy NowCoinbaseCoinbase COIN¬†is the most prominent crypto exchange in the U.S., earning a best-possible Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) score.Cash CowSeth Klarman is a legendary value investor, billionaire, and one of the highest-earning money managers in the world. In an interview last year, Klarman stated that he avoids crypto but sees value in Coinbase, saying, "Coinbase is sitting on $5 billion in cash, has less than that in debt, and is doing some smart things." Well, now that number has grown to more than 7 billion. I bring this to your attention because not many people trading a stock like COIN probably understand how sound the company is fundamentally.Coinbase Smashing the Street's ExpectationsOn May 3rd, the leading crypto exchange announced EPS of $4.4, smashing the Street's estimate of $1.07.Here is a snippet of the EPS transcript that stuck out to me:"Our financial performance in Q1 reflects our focused execution on product expansion, ongoing operational discipline, and strong crypto market conditions. We generated $1.6 billion of total revenue and $1.2 billion of net income*. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.0 billion ‚Äì more than we generated in all of 2023." Lastly, we continue to drive regulatory clarity for crypto through grassroots advocacy, pushing for legislation, and ongoing efforts to seek clarity through the courts." COIN has beaten expectations for five straight quarters, and not only are they beating them, they are smashing them. Over the past five quarters the average EPS surprise is 364.63%!Robinhood MarketsZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Robinhood HOOD is one of the most popular brokerages in the United States. Robinhood was the first major broker to "democratize" trading by offering a commission-free investing app. The app rose to prominence during the meme stock craze that was spurred on by retail investing groups on the social media platform Reddit¬†RDDT¬†and included meteoric moves in stocks like GameStop¬†GME.Bull Catalyst: CryptoHOOD recently added crypto-enabled trading. Though HOOD is late to the crypto game, the company has the perfect client base to take advantage of a Bitcoin BTC/USD bull market.Consistent Positive EPS SurprisesHOOD reported first-quarter earnings that trounced Zacks Consensus Estimates by 260%. Over the past four quarters, positive earnings beats have become the norm, with an average EPS beat of 230%!Record Net DepositsNet deposits are one of the most important metrics to monitor for brokers. HOOD net deposits reached a record $11.2 billion in Q1, translating to a 44% annualized growth rate and contributing to a 30% growth rate over the last twelve months. Meanwhile, CEO Vlad Tenev announced on May 14th that Robinhood hit $5B in equities trading volume.Robinhood Gold Is GrowingRobinhood recently announced a new "Gold" credit card. HOOD has already gained a healthy 260,000 new subscribers.MicroStrategyMicroStrategy MSTR has been around for years and is a leading provider of business intelligence software.Adopting the Bitcoin StandardFormer CEO and billionaire Michael Saylor made waves on Wall Street a few years ago when he got MSTR on the "Bitcoin Standard." Instead of sitting in inflationary assets like U.S. dollars, Saylor realized MSTR would be better off on a "Bitcoin sail." Essentially, MSTR is a leveraged Bitcoin bet. The results speak for themselves ‚Äì over the past five years, MicroStrategy is up more than 1,000%!Conversely, a good option for investors who do not want a leveraged bet but want to tap into Bitcoin's potential upside is the IBIT ETF IBIT.

Florida court reinstates Binance US money services license - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Binance US wins appeal to reinstate its Florida money-services business license.
Court ruled OFR lacked legal justification for the emergency suspension order.
Binance US suspension posed financial risks to over 170,000 Florida account holders.

Binance US has successfully appealed the suspension of its money-services business license in Florida.
The Florida First District Court of Appeal ruled that the emergency suspension order issued by the state Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) lacked sufficient legal justification.
Binance US suspension was unjustified
The suspension, initiated following Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao‚Äôs guilty plea on November 21, 2023, to federal charges of violating U.S. Anti-Money Laundering laws, was deemed unjustified by the court.
The court noted that the relevant state law uses the term ‚Äúmay,‚Äù indicating discretion rather than a mandatory action, for suspending a license.
In its ruling the court has said that it requires the OFR to provide additional reasoning beyond merely citing the statute and to explore less severe alternatives to outright suspension.
The court‚Äôs decision further emphasized that the suspension posed significant financial risks to over 170,000 Florida account holders.
The court stated, ‚ÄúFor Petitioner to immediately comply with the ESO, it would be necessary to liquidate the digital asset holdings of every customer [which] threatens financial harm because of digital asset price fluctuations.‚Äù
Binance US resumes operations in Florida
The suspension in Florida was one of the first among several states following Zhao‚Äôs plea, with similar actions in Alaska, Maine, North Carolina, and Oregon.
In addition, the status of Binance US‚Äôs operations remains uncertain in Georgia and Ohio, while it has never operated in Hawaii, Minnesota, New York, Texas, and Vermont.
Although the ruling is subject to appeal, Binance US can resume its operations in Florida for now.
The crypto exchange has, however, temporarily paused new user onboarding in Florida while continuing to serve its existing customers in the state.

Grabby Trump (GRATRUMP) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Grabby Trump (GRATRUMP) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Grabby Trump (GRATRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GRATRUMP has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Grabby Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Grabby Trump could become the next viral memecoin.



Grabby Trump launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Grabby Trump on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Grabby Trump by entering its contract address ‚Äì 84ABvkFYWuh5oCSvPMztyeK5yVQAsd17egSLgJN4X9nr ‚Äì in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GRATRUMP.

BREAKING: Highly Anticipated FED Minutes Released - Here Are The Most Important Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Investors were expecting to hear more details today about what led Federal Reserve officials to advance plans to slow the pace of balance sheet reduction even as the central bank keeps its benchmark interest rate steady.
Here are the highlights from the minutes of the April 30-May 1 meeting, where interest rates were kept constant:



'Many' respondents were uncertain about the degree to which the policy would be restricted.
'Various' participants are willing to tighten further if necessary.
Respondents assessed that it would take longer than previously anticipated to gain greater confidence that inflation would move sustainably towards 2%.
Several participants said it would be helpful to begin discussions about the appropriate term structure of the Fed's portfolio over the long term.
Nearly all respondents supported the Fed's decision to begin slowing the pace of decline in securities holdings; a few supported continuing the current pace.
Officials are discussing keeping interest rates steady for longer if inflation does not fall.
FED officials drew attention to the 'disappointing' inflation figures in the first quarter.
'Various' Fed officials have talked about raising interest rates if inflation warrants it.
Participants noted that the future policy path will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.
Many participants expressed uncertainty regarding the degree of policy restrictiveness.
Several participants spoke of a willingness to tighten policy further if the risks to the outlook materialize and make such action appropriate.
Some officials think long-term interest rates may be higher than previously thought.
Some officials worry that financial conditions are not restrictive enough.
Although the economic forecast of the FED staff is similar to the March outlook, it was stated that the deterioration in the financial positions of low-income households, in particular, could pose a greater obstacle to economic activity than anticipated.

While FED officials decided to keep the federal interest rate target at 5.2-5.50%, Powell stated that the current stance is appropriately restrictive and maintains maximum flexibility and optionality.

However, Citi's Andrew Hollenhorst argued that the economic data released so far this month, including the consumer price index, which points to a welcome slowdown in inflation, and the latest comments from FED speakers make the minutes ‚Äústale‚Äù at this point.





‚ÄúThe slowdown in employment growth and significant declines in individual sales and industrial production since the May 1 FOMC meeting will further convince officials that growth is slowing,‚Äù Hollenhorst wrote.

Whale Withdraws Over Half a Trillion PEPE Worth Nearly $8,000,000 From Binance As Memecoin Soars - The Daily Hodl


								A deep-pocketed crypto entity has been seen suddenly withdrawing more than a half trillion Pepe (PEPE) as the memecoin soars, on-chain data shows.
Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain noticed that the crypto whale withdrew 592 billion PEPE from Binance, the world‚Äôs top crypto exchange, which was worth nearly $8 million at the time of the transaction.

Pepe is trading for $0.0000137 at time of writing, up 11.5% in the past 24 hours and 108% in the last month.
Some analysts are suddenly turning bullish on Pepe, including pseudonymous crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa.
 ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking for a big cap meme to long, I think PEPE is a good one, good liquidity, strong volume. This one definitely catches up to the others a bit in my opinion ‚Äì not saying it‚Äôll flip Doge or anything, but should go up more relatively. Long in the green boxes.‚Äù

Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests Pepe could retest two trading ranges to the downside, including the range between $0.00001300 to $0.00001200 and $0.00001150 to $0.00001100, before rallying again.
However, another popular analyst DonAlt is warning that red-hot memes like Pepe could see a sudden collapse in value of more than 80% based on data from previous cycles.
‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm right, the popular memes we trade today will trade 80%+ lower. Then you‚Äôll have new memes come up that build new communities that run up. And we‚Äôll have the same discussions in a couple of years.‚Äù

Biden Campaign Pleads For Donations To Compete With Crypto Execs Supporting Trump

                        President Joe Biden‚Äôs election campaign team is calling for financial aid to keep up with his Republican, competition, who he says is backed by the wealthy crypto industry.Biden Begs For Support To Fight Crypto
In a widely circulated screenshot on Wednesday, Biden‚Äôs campaign team appeared to have messaged followers warning them of the sheer size of donations being received by the Trump campaign.‚ÄúFolks, this couldn‚Äôt be any more serious,‚Äù Biden‚Äôs message reads. ‚ÄúCryptocurrency executives and oil barrons are coming out of the woodwork for Trump. They‚Äôre rushing $800,000 checks at glitzy events.‚ÄùBiden admitted that Trump‚Äôs campaign was outraising his own, pulling $76 million in April, with $50 million raised purely from the former President‚Äôs $50 million Florida gala last month.Biden‚Äôs request mimics those of democratic senator Elizabeth Warren months prior, who is now in direct competition with a Republican pro-crypto lawyer for her seat in Massachusets.Figures from the Federal Election Commission last month showed that John Deaton ‚Äì who represented 75,000 XRP investors in a lawsuit with federal regulators last year ‚Äì raised $1.36 million in Q1, compared to Warren‚Äôs $1.1 million. Some of Deaton‚Äôs donors included Skybridge Capital co-founder Anthony Scaramucci and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, among others.Crypto‚Äôs Partisan Nature
Crypto‚Äôs lopsided support for Republicans follows years of hostile enforcement actions against the industry from the Democrat-led Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and direct efforts from the White House to hamper the Bitcoin mining industry.Earlier this month, the White House promised to veto legislation that would repeal SAB 121 ‚Äì an SEC rule widely criticized for preventing regulated banks from offering crypto custody services.Both the House and Senate have now passed the resolutions, with total Republican support alongside small Democrat support in both chambers.Meanwhile, Donald Trump ‚Äì who once derided Bitcoin as a scam ‚Äì is now warming up to the industry. After a February interview saying he would be tolerant of Bitcoin, the candidate has now begun accepting crypto-based campaign donations, with intentions to build a ‚Äúcrypto army‚Äù challenging Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs hostile efforts.An official filing in October 2023 showed that Trump personally owned between $250,000 and $500,000 in crypto.Later today, the House of Representatives will vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which is intended to foster broad regulatory clarity for crypto at large.

Bitcoin Bulls Are Strong: Over 450,000 Addresses Bought 273,000 BTC At This Level


																Bitcoin is cooling off after an impressive 25% spike from May 2024 lows. Even with this cool-off, some analysts are upbeat, predicting the coin will extend gains in future sessions.
Bitcoin Finds Strong Support Between $70,180 and $70,600
In a post on X, one analyst¬†believes Bitcoin has strong support at around $70,180 and $70,600. The analyst explained that on-chain data shows that over 450,000 addresses collectively bought over 273,000 BTC at this price range.¬†
Zone above $70,000 emerging as support | Source: @ali_charts on X
For this reason, the concentration of BTC holdings in this zone means the coin has strong support. If the level is to be broken, then sellers would need to make an even larger effort to break through this line, with a higher amount of BTC hitting the sell side of the equation.¬†

On-chain analytics firm Glassnode notes¬†that the Bitcoin market is cooling after intense selling pressure. After the strong uptick that saw the coin roar to as high as $73,800 in March 2024, prices plunged to as low as $56,500 this month. Prices have since recovered, but bulls have yet to break above all-time highs.
While capital inflows remain moderate, Glassnode adds, volatility has decreased noticeably. Still, whether this volatility will shoot higher once $72,000 is broken remains to be seen.
BTC Retraces: Will Bulls Break $72,000?
¬†
All eyes are on whether BTC bulls will shake off the current correction. In a post on X, another analyst said¬†holders shouldn‚Äôt be worried because of this pullback and the failure of bulls to confirm the May 20 leg up.
Pullbacks are inevitable in bull markets | Source: @CryptoJelleNL via X
Instead, the analyst is confident, saying pullbacks are a natural part of any bull market. The recent 23% correction, the analyst added, is an example. 
What‚Äôs important is that every retracement has been from a higher position. Therefore, the next local bottom will likely be higher than the previous one, potentially reaching around $80,000.¬†

	Related Reading



Thus far, BTC has a strong resistance of $72,000. The bulls didn‚Äôt push through this line, even with more serious attempts in early April. 
As a result, this reaction level remains important from a technical perspective. Any breakout for now would increase the probability of BTC prices floating to retest $73,800 or break higher.

In the days ahead, inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) coupled with improving sentiment might spark more demand. In that likelihood, BTC bulls will find the momentum to confirm the May 20 bar and break above the local resistance.

Solana & Bitcoin Sentiment Still Bearish: Signal To Buy?


								Data suggests the market sentiment around Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin (BTC) is negative currently, something that could benefit their prices.
Crowd Bearish About Solana & Bitcoin While Ethereum Gets All The Hype
As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Santiment in a post on X, investors have still not become bullish about Bitcoin and Solana despite their recent surge.
The relevant indicator here is the ‚ÄúWeighted Sentiment,‚Äù which is based on two other metrics: Sentiment Balance and Social Volume. The former measures the net sentiment among cryptocurrency traders¬†right now.

This indicator works by analyzing social media data and applying a machine learning model to differentiate between negative and positive posts about the asset. Then, it uses the difference between the two to determine which side is currently dominant.
The second metric of interest here, Social Volume, tracks the unique number of posts/messages/threads on social media platforms discussing a given asset. Essentially, its value represents the degree of discussion the coin receives from social media users.
While the Sentiment Balance does provide information about the net sentiment in the market, it‚Äôs not always useful, as it doesn‚Äôt say anything about how many users actually share this opinion.
The Weighted Sentiment fixes this problem by weighing the Sentiment Balance against the Social Volume. This means that this indicator‚Äôs value only spikes in either direction when many posts discuss the asset, and most of them are positive or negative about the coin.
Here is a chart showing the trend in the Weighted Sentiment for three of the top cryptocurrencies in the sector: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.

The value of the metric appears to have been quite positive for ETH recently | Source: Santiment on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Weighted Sentiment for Bitcoin and Solana has been negative recently. Interestingly, these red levels have persisted despite their prices observed bullish winds.
Ethereum, on the other hand, has seen a large positive spike in the indicator, implying that many bullish posts related to the coin are spreading on social media.
This optimism behind the cryptocurrency is due to positive news about the odds of the ETH spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) being approved.

Historically, market euphoria has been a bearish sign, as the price generally tends to move opposite to the majority‚Äôs expectations. Similarly, investors‚Äô fear has been a positive sign that fresh surges will start.
As such, at least going by the sentiment, Bitcoin and Solana may be more likely to see a rise than Ethereum, which may be getting too hot.
SOL Price
With gains of more than 19% over the past week, Solana is among the best performers out of the top coins by market cap. At present, SOL‚Äôs price is trading around $177.

                        Wednesday, 22 May 2024 ‚Äì Learn-to-Earn token 99Bitcoins ($99BTC) has raised $1.5 million from contributors to its presale as interest in its pioneering protocol grows.99Bitcoins is one of the most well-known and earliest of the Bitcoin education sites and is a respected resource for all those who wish to find out more about bitcoin and crypto more broadly.There are just five days to go before the token presale price increases from $0.00106 to $0.00107, so there‚Äôs no time to lose to catch the lowest bid.As Bitcoin hovers around the $70,000 mark a renewed push to all-time highs above $74,00,000 is on the cards, and that will keep 99Bitcoins‚Äô presale firmly in the spotlight.Ethereum ETF approval will further drive up interest in crypto and 99Bitcoins token
Bitcoin has entered the financial mainstream following the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which provide a regulated, cheap and easy entry point for investing in the preeminent digital asset.Since then, the possibility that an Ethereum ETF could be next up for approval has led to a resurgence in crypto prices, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the way.This is all good news for top crypto education and information sites like 99Bitcoins.Bloomberg Intelligence analysts have changed the probability of an Ethereum ETF being approved from 10% to 75%, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked providers to expedite submission of paperwork (19-b4s forms to be precise) that are seen as a precursor to an approval.Tomorrow, 23 May, the first provider to have its Ethereum ETF up for consideration by the SEC is VanEck Ethereum ETF.Although it is not certain that positive news will emerge tomorrow, all the signs are pointing to an approval, albeit the exact date may be several weeks away.The SEC is thought to be likely to approve all the submitted ETFs at the same time, as it did with the Bitcoin ETFs, in order to not give any one provider an advantage over its competitors.There are a total of 10 Ethereum ETFs seeking approval or conversion in the case of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.This news flow combined with the bitcoin halving event that typically ushers in a bullish pricing environment for crypto, means the 99Bitcoins presale is set to rocket.Helping $99BTC to stand out from the crowd is its strong protocol fundamentals, connected as it is to the mounting interest in the crypto space.99Bitcoins ($99BTC) is presenting to the market a revamped educational platform that monetizes education with a Learn-to-Earn rewards model that is uniquely well-positioned for success.There‚Äôs no telling how much value can be placed on trust, and 99Bitcoins has that enviable commodity by the bucket load.It means the platform will be able to capture a significant chunk of new entrants to the crypto space looking for best-in-class educational resources they can rely on.99Bitcoins‚Äô early emphasis on the visual learner through its YouTube channel will also stand it in good stead with crypto beginners, where its new visual courses are sure to be a hit.No business or website can rest on its laurels, but where 99Bitcoins is concerned, its pedigree heritage platform gives it a competitive advantage as an educator and resource provider.Its YouTube channel has 700,000 subscribers and the crypto courses already have more than two million registered users.This is how 99Bitcoins‚Äô token works to incentivize learning
99Bitcoins combines gamification with a leaderboard reward system to incentivize users to keep learning. The concept is simplicity itself: users earn crypto while learning about crypto.Interactive learning modules, quizzes, and tutorials are all designed with gamification in mind.User progression is reinforced through the unlocking of more courses, which means more opportunities to earn rewards ‚Äì at the core of the system is the $99BTC token to make learning engaging, enjoyable and profitable for all users.The emphasis on multimedia taps into the reality that people find it easier and less daunting to learn when they have audio and visual aids, instead of being expected to wade through a textbook.Building on its current offering, the courses will cover everything from the ins and outs of blockchains to crypto wallet basics, how-to guides all the way through to trading signals, strategies, and high-end technical knowledge.$99BTC token has a lot going for it in the utility stakes, which is why some crypto experts think it could be a top bet for the next 10x crypto:VIDEOWhere it all began for 99Bitcoins‚Ä¶ and where it is headed with BRC20 tokens
The roots of 99Bitcoins go back to 2013, two years before Ethereum even existed and around the same time Bitcoin achieved some mainstream awareness.Always an evangelist for financial freedom and an eye for getting people into the space, 99Bitcoins began life as BitcoinWithPayPal.com.The website said what it does on the tin.But including another company in the brand name didn‚Äôt go down too well with PayPal, so the 99Bitcoins brand was born.Being a trailblazer remains in the DNA of the website, which is why it is now pivoting to Web3 with its groundbreaking Learn-to-Earn ecosystem.Although $99BTC initially launches as an ERC-20 token, it will transition to BRC-20, the new Bitcoin Ordinals standard.Ordinals use spare ‚Äòinscriptions‚Äô space provided in the Bitcoin protocol to store the code for fungible tokens. The innovation first began as a way to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain.Among the new projects being built on the Bitcoin blockchain are the ORDI and SATS tokens, up 6.7% and 9% respectively over the past seven days.Therefore, 99Bitcoins is launching at an opportune time, as judged by the current market sentiment and the targeting of the expected continued growth in this exciting new area of Bitcoin development.The market value (market capitalization) of BRC-20 tokens is today a little shy of a whopping $2 billion.99Bitcoins is giving away $99,999 in BTC to early presale buyers
In addition to the presale opportunity, 99Bitcoins is also running a $99,999 airdrop of Bitcoin (BTC). This will be exclusively for early supporters who follow the instructions on the presale section of the official website.In the $9,999 giveaway the project is rewarding 99 participants from a total giveaway pot of $99,999 worth of Bitcoin. Eligibility is secured by following, retweeting, or signing up on the website.99Bitcoins is continuing its legacy of making Bitcoin and crypto work for ordinary people.Through education, helpful resources and now an incentivized Web3 learning platform, 99Bitcoins will help newbies onboard and grow their experience in the crypto world, and earn rewards while they are doing so ‚Äì that‚Äôs a killer combo as crypto goes mainstream.Visit the presale website at presale.99bitcoins.com (beware of imitators).¬†

Waiting for Ethereum Spot ETFs Continues: Top 10 Developer-Focused Altcoins Likely to Be Impacted Upon Approval Revealed - Bitcoin Sistemi


While there are strong expectations that Ethereum Spot ETFs will be approved by the SEC, the Ethereum ecosystem altcoins that cryptocurrency developers are most focused on have emerged.
With the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs, it is thought that other ETH ecosystem altcoins may also be affected by this event.


Here are the ETH ecosystem altcoins and developer scores that cryptocurrency developers have focused on the most in the last 30 days:

Chainlink (LINK) ‚Äì 479.77
Status (SNT) ‚Äì 307.1
Ethereum (ETH) ‚Äì 304.17
Decentraland (MANA) ‚Äì 258.63
Audius (AUDIO) ‚Äì 211.33
sUSD (SUSD) ‚Äì 185.07
Synthetix (SNX) ‚Äì 185.07
Holo (HOT) ‚Äì 146.9
API3 (API3) ‚Äì 131.03
The Graph (GRT) ‚Äì 123.37

All of these mentioned altcoins have the ERC20 standard.






However, Ethereum spot ETFs have not yet been approved, and altcoins in this ecosystem may react widely to approval or rejection. However, according to information obtained by various cryptocurrency journalists from sources, some of them originating from the SEC, these ETFs seem likely to be approved.
On the other hand, the fact that these ETFs will not have staking features causes some analysts to list them among the factors that may reduce the demand for these ETFs.

SEC's Gensler criticizes crypto regulation bill ahead of vote


SEC Chair Gary Gensler opposed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) in a statement on Wednesday.



The bill, which has garnered support from key Republicans and major cryptocurrency firms, is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives, with its future in the Senate remaining uncertain.



Gensler‚Äôs critique centers on the risk that the bill could undermine the SEC‚Äôs ability to protect investors and the integrity of U.S. capital markets by altering the classification of crypto assets and diminishing regulatory oversight.



‚Äú[FIT 21] would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk,‚Äù Gensler said.

	
	
	
	


The FIT21 Act, introduced in July 2023, seeks to establish clear federal guidelines for digital asset markets and delineate the roles of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in cryptocurrency regulation. 



Gensler said that the bill could erode the Howey test, a cornerstone in determining investment contracts, and allow crypto firms to circumvent SEC regulation by self-certifying their products as ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù digital commodities.



Additionally, the FIT21 Act‚Äôs exclusion of crypto trading platforms from the definition of an exchange is seen by Gensler as a move that could undermine investor protection. 



The White House also released a statement on Wednesday that opposes the passage of the bill.

	
	
	

	


‚ÄúH.R. 4763 in its current form lacks sufficient protections for consumers and investors who engage in certain digital asset transactions,‚Äù the President‚Äôs Executive Office said on Wednesday.

Ethereum Game 'Pixelmon' Reveals MON Token Airdrop Details - Decrypt

Pok√©mon-esque crypto and NFT game Pixelmon has announced airdrop details for its soon-to-be-launched MON token.Over 180,000 wallets will be eligible for the airdrop on Monday, May 27 with the claim process starting at 9:30 a.m. UTC through the newly created Mon Protocol. MON will be minted as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum.Those eligible include holders of selected Pixelmon game NFTs, players of Pixelmon hyper-casual game Kevin the Adventurer, participants in the PixelPals ‚ÄúFarm2Farm‚Äù competition, and buyers of the MON token presale.¬†Pixelmon originally launched with clunky Minecraft-like artwork which led to the battle arena title being widely ridiculed online. Now two years, an ownership change, and a dramatic artwork overhaul later, the Pixelmon IP is birthing quarterly mini-game releases with larger-scale games further on the horizon.This included Kevin the Adventurer, which was built around a heavily memed ogre-like creature from the Pixelmon universe, soon garnering 36,000 active players on Base. And then PixelPals was launched on the Mantle network, blending pet care and trading card elements. Both player bases are being rewarded during this airdrop.One group that won‚Äôt be receiving their MON tokens during the token generation event are those who completed Mon Protocol airdrop missions. These players will get their tokens shortly after the event has finished, as originally planned.Alongside the launch and airdrop of the MON token, a staking platform will also go live. Token stakers will accumulate points that can be spent in a launch pool, more details about this will be announced ‚Äúsoon‚Äù after the token launches, but the basic gist with most staking programs is that holders can earn rewards for locking them up within the game or platform.LiquidX bought the Pixelmon IP from the original creators in 2022, setting out to expand the initially ridiculed brand of Pixelmon into trading cards, merchandise, and various media adaptations using the Mon Protocol to power this growth.The MON token is designed to fuel what‚Äôs been described as an ‚ÄúIP protocol‚Äù to incentivize and reward NFT holders who help grow the Pixelmon brand as it expands with larger games in the future.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Gensler & Biden Speak Out Against FIT21 Act | Bankless


SEC Chair Gary Gensler says he strongly opposes the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), citing major concerns about investor protection and market integrity. President Biden has also signaled opposition but stopped short of threatening a veto.What‚Äôs the Scoop?Regulatory Concerns: Gensler opposes FIT21, arguing it undermines decades of securities regulation.Investor Risks: He claims FIT21 would allow crypto firms to self-certify as "decentralized," putting them outside the SEC's oversight and risking investor protection.State of Legislative Support: Major crypto groups and presumptive GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump support FIT21 as a necessary modernization of outdated securities laws. The U.S. House of Representatives plans to vote on FIT21 soon, and even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is considering the bill. Biden Opposition: While the White House opposes the bill over concerns about investor protections, it is not threatening a veto. This shows they are open to working with Congress on future bipartisan legislation.
Bankless TakeGary Gensler's opposition to the FIT21 Act is expected but disappointing, particularly considering the bipartisan history of the bill.¬†As Republicans lead the vote in our industry, it would be wise for Democrats to come around and reassess the issue of crypto with fresh eyes as the election approaches. Many speculate this may be the reason for the ETH ETF‚Äôs likely approval, with the White House‚Äôs stance now potentially reinforcing this view. A good thing too as proponents of FIT21, like Stand With Crypto, make it clear that crypto support spans the political spectrum, especially among Gen Z.In the end, Gary‚Äôs stance just increases the importance of voicing your support for the bill.Tell Your Representative to Support FIT21 on BanklessHelp DC pass crypto legislation that makes sense.Click here to find your representative and ask them to vote YES on the FIT21 Act.

Experts speak out on how high Ethereum could go with an ETF approval - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Tomorrow is the final deadline for the approval of VanEck‚Äôs spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, and expectations are high. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared that an approval movement ‚Äúis happening,‚Äù despite regulatory indicators pointing out to the contrary direction until Monday.As a result, Ethereum (ETH) leaped up to 21% in less than 48 hours and stood just 22% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. Bitcoin (BTC) leaped 96% in two months before the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and reached its all-time high two months later.James Davies, co-founder and CPO at Crypto Valley Exchange, highlights that Bitcoin‚Äôs case was different. ‚ÄúIn that instance, though, everything came together ‚Äì ETFs, bitcoin halving, and global inflation easing significantly ‚Äì and lined up to drive Bitcoin. Ethereum has already had the crypto cycle and global market sentiment increase,‚Äù he shares.Although Davies sees Ethereum ETF inflows having a substantial impact, propelling ETH to new all-time highs, it may be hard for Ethereum to replicate BTC‚Äôs movement after the funds‚Äô approval. ‚ÄúIt does, however, present a great steady growth story for the rest of 2024.‚ÄùRuslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, also shares the view that an Ethereum ETF might trigger a sharp ETH price increase. Moreover, this movement might not be fully priced, with significant upside yet to be seen. ‚ÄúIf so, it will be a powerful impetus for the whole crypto market and a stimulus for other coins‚Äô growth,‚Äù added Lienkha.Bitfinex‚Äôs analysts believe that a spot Ethereum ETF approval could play out just like the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, which was ‚Äúa sell-the-news event before a long-term bullish outlook was triggered, causing a multi-month rally.‚Äù As for inflows, they expect a similar level compatible with ETH‚Äôs market cap.The current move from sub $3000 to $3800 is a result of the market pricing in the higher odds of an ETF approval. It is important that market participants often front-run and price in odds as absolute ‚Äì implying that 75% odds of approval by Bloomberg analysts could potentially be priced in as 100%.Marko Jurina CEO at Jumper.Exchange, pointed out that BTC rose nearly 65% following the trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Thus, a similar movement would propel ETH ‚Äúwell beyond its previous all-time high.‚Äù Zentner also believes that the approval might trigger a crypto market growth for the second half of 2024.What if‚Ä¶?Despite the optimism regarding the Ethereum ETF approval, there is still a slight chance of rejection. Moreover, as highlighted by Seyffart, a good part of investors are misunderstanding the current movement since approval doesn‚Äôt translate to immediate trading. Both of these scenarios might then upset investors.Nevertheless, in the light of recent developments, those events are now being priced out, says James Davies, from Crypto Valley Exchange. On the other hand, Jumper.Exchange‚Äôs Marko Jurina believes that both negative possible events are already priced in.‚ÄúWhen the spot BTC ETFs first came to market, there was actually a brief sell-off where some took profits before the rally resumed. Additionally, given the volatile nature of the market, good and bad news gives ample opportunity for market makers to create more violent price swings, so blood on the streets is definitely possible. More problematic for the ETH community (if no approval) would be the loss of a narrative as a catalyst,‚Äù Jurina added.Moreover, a slight drop followed by a consolidation period is also a possibility, shares Ruslan Lienkha from YouHodler. ‚ÄúEthereum ETF approval is just a matter of time. The SEC will approve it sooner or later after the status clarification of ETH, and it matters little if it is recognized as a commodity, security, or something else. As for now, fundamentally, nothing will change for ETH. It will remain the second crypto in the industry even without ETFs.‚ÄùEven if an unlikely rejection happens, Bitfinex analysts describe a ‚Äòlayered‚Äô scenario, which could end in a ‚Äúhard rejection‚Äù or a ‚Äúsoft rejection.‚Äù A hard rejection would include ETH being considered a security, while a soft rejection would be limited to ETF proposals.‚ÄúThe former could be very bearish leading to a retrace of the entire move up currently. The latter could lead to more speculation continuing over a future approval on re-appeal,‚Äù Bitfinex analysts concluded.

                        President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration will oppose the passage of Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) amidst its vote in the House of Representatives, a Wednesday statement from the White House claims.President Joe Biden To Oppose FIT21 Amid Vote
The White House statement says that FIT21 ‚Äúlacks sufficient protections for consumers and investors who engage in certain digital asset transactions,‚Äù but stops short of vetoing the legislation altogether.‚ÄúThe Administration is eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system,‚Äù the statement continues.The Biden administration‚Äôs statement comes just as the House of Representatives are scheduled to vote on whether or not to advance the key piece of crypto regulation widely supported by the blockchain sector.If passed, FIT21 would allot greater freedoms to U.S. crypto operators and delegate increased regulatory responsibility of digital assets towards the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).Meanwhile, critics argue that the passage of FIT21 could cause market instability and negate already established securities law.SEC Chair Gary Gensler Pushes Back On Crypto Regulation Bill
On Wednesday morning, United States Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler released his own statement criticizing the bill, claiming it would put ‚Äúinvestors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.‚Äù‚ÄúThe crypto industry‚Äôs record of failures, frauds, and bankruptcies is not because we don‚Äôt have rules or because the rules are unclear,‚Äù Gensler wrote. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because many players in the crypto industry don‚Äôt play by the rules.‚ÄùBoth Gensler and the Biden administration have been criticized for their stringent regulatory-focused approach to digital assets, with the SEC filing litigation against several major crypto organizations in the past several years alone.However, new momentum around a handful of crypto-related legislation on Capitol Hill could spell the beginning of the end for the SEC‚Äôs regulation-by-enforcement approach altogether.Just last week, both chambers of Congress passed a bipartisan resolution that would overturn the federal agency‚Äôs controversial staff accounting bulletin SAB121, despite Biden having released a statement saying he would veto it.Meanwhile, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump announced has seemingly embraced cryptocurrency, with his campaign beginning to accept donations in crypto as of Tuesday.Alexander Grieve, Paradigm‚Äôs lead on government affairs, noted a shift in the White House‚Äôs tone towards digital assets between the Biden administration‚Äôs recent veto announcement and Wednesday‚Äôs statement on FIT21, calling it ‚Äúa huge course correction.‚ÄùDespite U.S. lawmakers‚Äô efforts, only time will tell whether or not common-sense crypto regulation will be passed anytime soon.

Ethereum Futures ETFs Hit Record Daily Trading Volume Amid Anticipation of Spot Approvals

                        The daily trading volume for Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) surged to an all-time high yesterday, fueled by increasing anticipation of potential spot approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission¬†(SEC).On Tuesday, Ethereum futures ETFs recorded a trading volume of $47.75 million, a 40% increase from the previous peak of $34.18 million set on March 5, when Ether was nearing the $4,000 mark. This build-up followed a significant spike of $23.67 million on Monday.New Records From All Corners
ProShares‚Äô Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) led the category, accounting for $43.14 million or 90% of yesterday‚Äôs trading volume. VanEck‚Äôs Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and Bitwise‚Äôs Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) followed, generating $2.6 million and $2.01 million, respectively, according to¬†The Block‚Äôs dashboard data.Despite this new record, the trading volume for Ethereum futures ETFs, which launched in October 2023, remains modest compared to spot Bitcoin ETFs.The latter debuted in January and amassed a combined trading volume of $2.16 billion on Tuesday, spearheaded by BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT with $1.12 billion.¬†However, it is noteworthy that spot Bitcoin ETF daily trading volume has significantly decreased since its peak of $9.93 billion on March 5, coinciding with Bitcoin surpassing its previous cycle high of around $69,000.Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum Trust (ETHE) also saw a substantial rise in trading volume on Tuesday, reaching $684.44 million ‚Äî the highest since its all-time high of $842.67 million in May 2021. ETHE‚Äôs discount to net asset value narrowed to -6.7%, its lowest level in over two years.¬†Investors are purchasing¬†discounted shares in anticipation of a potential ETF conversion, reminiscent of the scenario with Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) before its conversion to an ETF on January 11.Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Likely Close
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has¬†recently requested exchanges to update their spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings by submitting new Form 19b-4¬†on an ‚Äúaccelerated basis.‚Äù This requirement suggests that the SEC might be leaning towards approving the Ethereum ETF applications by the upcoming deadline, potentially leading to the issuance of the second spot digital asset ETF in the U.S.¬†Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have raised the approval odds from 25% to 75%, while ETF Store president Nate Geraci highlighted the necessity for the SEC to approve both the 19b-4s and S-1s for the ETFs to launch.This possible approval is seen as a significant shift in U.S. crypto policy. Variant Fund Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky noted that such an approval would surprise many in Washington, D.C., and could signal a significant policy shift rather than just the introduction of an ETF.Notably, Standard Chartered also maintains its bullish prediction of $8,000 for Ethereum (ETH) by 2024, driven by the increasing likelihood of Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals. The bank forecasts that these ETFs could launch in the U.S. this week with 80% to 90% confidence, potentially leading to significant inflows of 2.39 to 9.15 million Ether, translating to $15 billion to $45 billion in the first year.The renewed optimism surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs has contributed to a¬†20% rise in Ether‚Äôs price since Monday, driving the price to around $3,792. According to Coinmarketcap, ETH is trading at $3,741 at the time of writing.
