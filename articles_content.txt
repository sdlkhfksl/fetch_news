AVAX Price Uptrend To Continue? These Could Be The Factors To Watch


                            AVAX price is gaining pace above the $36.50 resistance. Avalanche could rise further if there is a clear move above the $40.00 resistance zone.

AVAX price is moving higher from the $30.50 support zone against the US dollar.
The price is trading above $35.00 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $34.00 on the 4-hour chart of the AVAX/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair could continue to rise if it stays above the $36.30 and $35.50 support levels.

AVAX Price Aims Higher
After a steady decline, Avalanche’s AVAX found support near the $30.50 zone. A low was formed near $30.58, and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
The price gained over 10% and broke many hurdles near $35.00. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $34.00 on the 4-hour chart of the AVAX/USD pair. The pair even cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $39.83 swing high to the $30.58 low.
AVAX price is now trading above $36.50 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $37.65 zone or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $39.83 swing high to the $30.58 low.

The next major resistance is forming near the $39.80 zone. If there is an upside break above the $39.80 level, the price could surge over 10%. In the stated case, the price could rise steadily toward the $42.50 level or even $44.00.
Dips Supported in Avalanche?
If AVAX price fails to continue higher above the $37.65 or $39.80 levels, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $36.30 level.
The main support is near the $35.20 zone and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). A downside break below the $35.20 level could open the doors for a major decline towards $32.80. The next major support is near the $30.50 level.

Jack Dorsey leaves board of decentralized social network Bluesky

Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has left Bluesky’s board — the decentralized social media platform he conceived and funded in 2019 when he was Twitter’s CEO.Bluesky confirmed Dorsey’s exit in a May 5 post on the platform, writing that it was “searching for a new board member” and thanked Dorsey for his help in starting and funding the project.Hours earlier, Dorsey had responded with a curt “no” to someone on X asking if he was still on Bluesky’s board. Neither Bluesky nor Dorsey explained why he decided to leave. Bluesky did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Source: BlueSkyMeanwhile, the early Bluesky backer was busy on X plugging his grants for open interest protocols and calling the now Elon Musk-owned social network “freedom technology.”Source: Jack DorseyTech sector executive social activity tracking X account Big Tech Alert posted that Dorsey had unfollowed “well over 2000 people,” parsing his follow list down to three people: Musk, Stella Assange — wife of imprisoned WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange — and NSA contractor-turned-whistleblower Edward Snowden.Related: Decentralized social networks have a retention problem, say execsDorsey keeping Musk on his follow list and the endorsement of X suggests the two may have made amends.In April 2023, Dorsey took to Bluesky to lambast Musk, saying he was running X poorly and the board shouldn’t have forced the sale to him, according to TechCrunch.Dorsey announced Bluesky in late 2019 when he was Twitter’s CEO, posting that the firm was “funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media.”Bluesky didn’t launch in beta until March 2023 and only opened to everyone on Feb. 7, 2024.

                        Bitcoin has officially processed over one billion transactions since its inception.According to data published on Clark Moody Bitcoin, this landmark was reached on May 5, when transaction number 1,000,000,000 was recorded. The transaction was included in block 842,241.
This achievement comes 15 years after the Bitcoin network went live on Jan. 3, 2009, taking a total of 5,602 days or roughly 800 weeks. The blockchain would see an average of 178,507 transactions per day.Bitcoin Gains New Ground in 2024
The year of 2024 has been a critical year for the leading crypto. In January, the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved in the United States, followed by the recent launch of similar products in Hong Kong, marking the first of its kind in Asia.In April, the fourth Bitcoin halving took place. It reduced the Bitcoin mining rewards by half, bringing it down from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC.Due to the popularity of Bitcoin ETFs, the pre-halving hype, and the potential impact of U.S economy, the first cryptocurrency witnessed its all-time-high on March 24, 2024. CoinGecko recorded a trading price of $73,737.94, breaking the previous historical highs.Over the past 30 days, the crypto experienced significant fluctuations. BTC price dropped from the $70,000 level and saw a recent bearish period trading below $60,000. It is currently trading at $64,222, marking 1.2% up within the past 24 hours.GBTC Records First Net Inflows in 78 Dyas
Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ETF, or GBTC, has seen its first day of net positive inflows after a long period of outflows, recording $63 million on May 3, according to preliminary data from Farside.Franklin Templeton’s ETF achieved a record inflow of $60.9 million. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund topped the chart with inflows of $102.6 million, while Bitwise and Invesco Galaxy followed with $33.5 million and $33.2 million, respectively.

Bitcoin Hits 1 Billion Transaction Milestone 10 Years Faster Than Visa


							

The Bitcoin blockchain network has processed its one-billionth transaction.



An analyst pointed out that the accomplishment surpasses Visa’s timeline by a decade.



Industry experts anticipate accelerated adoption as institutions enter the BTC market.




The premier crypto blockchain network, Bitcoin (BTC), has processed its one-billionth transaction. According to Clark Moody’s Bitcoin data, this milestone was reached on Sunday, May 5. The event comes when Bitcoin’s price shows signs of stabilization, hovering around the $64,000 mark.



Prominent figures in the Bitcoin community, including former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, have marked this development. 







Tarik Sammour, an associate professor at the University of Adelaide, South Australia, also reacted to the Bitcoin milestone. Sammour emphasized that the Bitcoin network processed 1 billion transactions flawlessly, securely, and without any centralized intermediary.



Meanwhile, other market commentators have leveraged the opportunity to draw attention to Bitcoin’s performance compared to traditional payment networks. Matteo Pallegrini, the founder of the Orange Pill App, highlighted that Bitcoin reached this milestone in a mere 15 years, a feat that took Visa 25 years to accomplish. 







However, the Alpha Beta Soup YouTube channel host disagreed with Pallegrini’s comparison with Visa. He pointed out that Visa was established in 1958 during an analog era. He highlighted that even online consumer banking did not emerge until 1994.



In rebuttal, Pallegrini highlighted that Visa enjoyed a monopoly until the 1970s. On the other hand, Bitcoin competes with hundreds of payment companies such as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Venmo, and Alipay, among others. Pallegrini underscored the billions of dollars in marketing expenditures in this competitive landscape, whereas Bitcoin has no such.









Notably, the crypto community anticipates that Bitcoin’s adoption curve will steepen significantly from its present trajectory, especially with the new involvement of institutions through Bitcoin spot ETF.Renowned Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo shared data suggesting that Bitcoin’s adoption rate is only 4.7%, akin to the internet’s adoption in January 1999. This comparison implies that, although Bitcoin is gaining traction, it remains in the early phase of its adoption journey.

Cardano: Forget $1, ADA is in danger of falling to $0.40 - AMBCrypto



The Elliot Wave showed that ADA had slipped below the crucial support.
Signals from the liquidation levels and OI predicted a decrease to $0.42.

More Crypto Online, a crypto channel, disclosed that Cardano’s [ADA] bottom was not yet in, and another decline could be close.
According to the session posted on YouTube, the anchor noted that the Elliot Wave confirmed the signal.
Explaining the thesis, the channel mentioned that,
“We have seen only a 3-wave corrective rally. These are typically not bullish and ADA might break down or movie sideways.”
Sellers are on the offensive side
The Elliot Wave is a technical theory that looks at recurrent price patterns. This way, traders can catch the tops and bottoms of a cycle.
However, More Crypto Online mentioned that ADA’s breakdown below the $0.48 support implied that any bullish bias has been invalidated.
Therefore, the price could slide down Wave 5 which could signal a large degree of downswing. Should this happen, the price of the Cardano native token might slide to $0.42.
As of this writing, ADA’s price was $0.45. This was a 2% decrease in the last 24 hours.
Previously, AMBCrypto reported how the token was showing signs that mirrored its incredible rally in the last 24 bull market.
But if this recent theory holds water, that prediction could be set back. However, technical data alone would not cut it for Cardano. Hence, we checked out the potential of the cryptocurrency from an on-chain angle.
First off, AMBCrypto looked at the Open Interest (OI). For context, OI refers to the sum of all open positions connected to a contract in the derivatives market.
Source: Santiment
An increase in the indicator implies an increase in net positioning. It could also imply that buyers (read longs) are aggressive.
However, Cardano’s OI was $548.6 million at press time— a decrease from the value seven days ago.
The inference in this case is that sellers (shorts) are the aggressive ones. If this decline goes unchecked, the prediction of $0.42 could be validated.
Will ADA move to $0.42?
Besides the OI, we also analyzed the liquidation levels and CLLD. CLLD stands for Cumulative Liquidation Levels Delta (CLLD). Liquidation levels predict price levels where price large liquidations might occur.
With this metric, traders can decide whether to go long or short. For the CLLD, its positive value indicates more long liquidations. On the other hand, negative values of the CLLD suggest more short liquidations.

Read Cardano’s [ADA] Price Prediction 2024-2025

From the chart below, there was no magnetic zone that could attract a rise in Cardano’s price. But the CLLD was positive, indicating a looming full retrace for Cardano.
Source: Hyblock
Therefore, this bearish bias could restrict ADA from starting an upside movement. For the time being, the price of the token could drop to $0.40. This might be the target in a highly bearish situation.

Legal Storm Brews For Coinbase: Lawsuit Claims Deceptive Practices


								Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, finds itself embroiled in a multi-front legal war. From disgruntled investors to the watchful eye of the SEC, the company faces challenges that threaten its operations and cast a shadow over the future of crypto regulation.

Coinbase Accused Of Selling Unregistered Securities
A new class-action lawsuit filed in California alleges Coinbase knowingly violated state securities laws by selling unregistered securities. The plaintiffs, a group of investors, target specific tokens like Solana and Uniswap, arguing they should be classified as investments and not mere digital assets.
They point to a possible contradiction within the exchange’s own user agreement, which may define the company as a “Securities Broker.” This lawsuit echoes a similar one already underway, suggesting a growing trend of investor discontent with Coinbase’s crypto offerings.

Coinbase Vs. SEC: A Battle For Regulatory Clarity
The most prominent legal fight involves the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC accuses Coinbase of acting as an unregistered securities exchange and broker by offering unregistered tokens. The company vehemently denies these charges and has filed an appeal against the initial ruling.
This clash highlights the core issue: the lack of clear regulations governing cryptocurrency. Coinbase, along with many in the industry, views this lawsuit as an overreach by the SEC, pushing for a more defined regulatory framework that fosters innovation without stifling growth.

Bitcoin is now trading at $64.493. Chart: TradingView
John Deaton Joins The Fray
Adding another layer of intrigue is the involvement of John Deaton, a prominent crypto lawyer known for his advocacy against regulatory overreach. Deaton has filed an amicus brief in support of Coinbase in the SEC battle.
This move signifies the industry’s unified front against what they perceive as stifling regulations. Deaton’s pro bono work highlights the high stakes involved, not just for the crypto exchange, but for the entire crypto ecosystem.
Beyond The SEC: GYEN And Staking Programs Face Scrutiny
Coinbase’s legal woes extend beyond the SEC lawsuit. A separate case accuses the exchange of mishandling the GYEN stablecoin, a cryptocurrency pegged to the Japanese Yen. Plaintiffs allege that the firm promoted and traded GYEN despite knowing of its volatility, leading to significant investor losses.

Additionally, the company’s staking program, which allows users to earn rewards by holding crypto, has drawn the attention of regulators. The SEC views staking as an unregistered security, while several US states have joined the case, further complicating the legal landscape for Coinbase.

Dogecoin Price Prediction: Is a Massive DOGE Price Rally in the Making?


																TL;DR

DOGE spikes approximately 15% weekly, nearing $0.17, as analysts predict a bullish trajectory fueled by breaking multi-year resistance and increased transaction volume.
Some foresee DOGE’s potential to reach $1, drawing parallels to previous price corrections followed by significant surges.


DOGE Enters a New Bullish Trend?
The revival of the cryptocurrency market has been more than evident in the past few days, with Bitcoin (BTC) reclaiming the $64,000 mark and Ethereum (ETH) climbing above $3,100. However, one digital asset witnessed even more impressive gains, and that is Dogecoin (DOGE).
The price of the biggest meme coin by market capitalization is up approximately 15% on a weekly scale, inching towards $0.17.
DOGE Price, Source: CoinGecko

According to many analysts, the latest pump has established a predominantly bullish environment for DOGE, meaning its value could rise much more substantially in the following months.
One person to support that thesis is the X user Rekt Capital. The trader, who has almost half a million followers on the social media platform, claimed that Dogecoin “flipped a multi-year resistance into new support,” resulting in a “new Macro Uptrend.”




Crypto Catalysts was even more bullish, highlighting the meme coin’s increased daily transaction volume, “reclaiming weekly level,” and other positive factors. The X user assumed that DOGE’s path to the milestone of $1 is clear. 
Previous DOGE Forecasts
One crypto analyst who also chipped in lately is Ali Martinez. The X user remained unfazed by the market decline last week and DOGE’s plummeting price, maintaining that the asset’s retreat could be “part of its usual behavior before massive bull runs.”
He noted several occasions in the past years when the meme coin’s price dipped before soaring significantly. The first case was in 2017 when DOGE retraced by 40% before exploding by almost 1,000%.
The situation repeated four years later, with the token’s valuation nosediving by 56% but later skyrocketing by a whopping 12,000%, reaching an all-time high of almost $0.70.
“Now, in 2024, DOGE has yet again broken out of a descending triangle! It is currently undergoing a 47% price correction, very similar to previous cycles, which could ignite the next DOGE bull run,” Ali Martinez concluded.

How and where to view crypto transaction histories

Each transaction on the blockchain incurs a transaction fee based on a tiered pricing structure, meaning fees are determined by transaction size or network activity levels. These fees can vary significantly, making it important to monitor crypto transactions closely. A user can identify patterns and develop strategies to minimize costs by analyzing transaction history. Viewing transaction history can help with tracking and transaction analysis.A cryptocurrency holder can perform transaction tracking in various ways, such as utilizing the search function on a blockchain explorer. This article provides a step-by-step guide on checking crypto transaction logs and where to find the historical data, which is crucial for transaction analysis.Where to check crypto transactions historyUsers can employ several strategies for transaction viewing: 1. Blockchain explorerBlockchain explorers are blockchain-specific, meaning they only work with the particular blockchain they’re designed for. A blockchain explorer is a tool that reveals records on the crypto ledger.Most explorers are open to the public, enabling the viewing of all transactions initiated and completed on a blockchain network. Each entry contains transaction details, such as the amount, timestamp and the sender and receiver’s address.Blockchain explorers have an intuitive user interface (UI), allowing users to search for all transactions, blocks, wallet addresses and digital asset history. It keeps track of all cryptocurrency records, enabling the confirmation of transaction status, block and wallet balance. A blockchain explorer can help diagnose a transaction or wallet balance issue.Examples of cryptocurrency explorers include:btcscan.org/ - Bitcoinetherscan.io - Ethereumsolscan.io - Solanalive.blockcypher.com/ltc/ - Litecoinbithomp.com/explorer - XRPA user can use the explorer to verify the transaction history details of a wallet by entering the wallet’s address in the explorer’s search bar. This method is also effective for a cold wallet, which is not connected to the internet, by first securely accessing the address of the cold wallet to search for its transaction history. Before using this functionality, taking appropriate security measures to protect your funds and private keys is crucial.2. Crypto walletIf the searcher used a wallet to transfer tokens, they can use its cryptocurrency records to access the transaction history. A wallet records all the registered incoming and outgoing transactions in the history section of the wallet. Click any transaction to view its details.3. Third-party servicesSome third-party platforms can offer insights into transaction histories as they can provide a feed of all transactions. These platforms have a user-friendly interface that displays aggregated data from a blockchain.Most third-party platforms allow users to view transactions on desktops or smart devices. They allow users to filter transactions using parameters, such as the amount, date and transaction or token type, presenting the results in an easy-to-understand format.Similarly, the cryptocurrency market has plenty of crypto wallet tracker tools that help track wallet transactions. By entering the search query, a user will gain access to transaction history, investment patterns and potentially some wallet-holder information (if the network allows for reduced anonymity). 4. Downloading the entire blockchainExpert users can download the entire blockchain history by running a full node. This gives them offline access to local searches rather than relying on online resources. However, running a full archival node can be resource-intensive and requires significant storage space. For instance, it is not unusual for the node to require 340 gigabytes of space the first time a user runs it.How to view crypto transaction history on a blockchain explorerUsers may follow these steps when using a blockchain explorer to view transaction history:Step 1: Go to the search field on the blockchain explorer.Step 2: Enter the details of the crypto transaction. The explorer allows users to search by different parameters like the sender’s or receiver’s address, transaction ID, transaction date or the block hash where the transaction data is stored.If the results do not display after entering the search query, click “search” or the search button to start the search.Step 3: If the user enters the right transaction details on the search bar, they will receive a result or a list of the possible results that could match the transaction under search.To find a particular transaction, enter the exact details of the transaction, such as the transaction hash or the exact amount sent.Step 4: Click on the desired transaction to enter the transaction page, which provides further details about the transaction. View or download/export the transaction(s) for analysis, or copy a transaction ID and send it to anyone needing proof. How to utilize a blockchain explorer to view wallet historyInstead of logging into a wallet to view transaction history, a user can follow these steps to view the transaction history of a crypto wallet:Step 1: Go to the search bar of a blockchain explorer.Step 2: Enter the exact wallet address on the search bar. It’s preferable to copy-paste the address from the wallet app to avoid errors. Click the “search” or search button.N/B: Ensure the wallet under search is compatible with the blockchain explorer.Step 3: The search results will display the entire digital currency history and the assets present in the wallet. View the different categories, including analytics and public comments on the wallet.How to use wallet activity to view transaction historyThe multichain Exodus wallet is used for illustrative purposes to access wallet transaction history:Step 1: After logging into Exodus, click the wallet icon.Step 2: Locate and click the portfolio button. Users with multiple portfolios should click the corresponding portfolio for which they want to view the transaction history. Those with only one portfolio should skip to step 3.Step 3: Click the profile button at the bottom. Select the history button to view historical transactions. Step 4: To narrow the search, click the “All” drop-down menu to filter the transactions using options like sent, received or exchanged transactions.Step 5: Click on a transaction to view its details.How to use third-party services to view the transaction historyThe Exodus platform will be used to illustrate the use of third-party services for accessing blockchain history:Step 1: Click/tap the “History” icon on the Exodus desktop or mobile app. Users should click/tap the portfolio they want to view. If users do not have multiple portfolios, they should skip to the next step.Step 2: Filter the results using the “All assets” drop-down menu. The drop-down menu lets users filter results by sent, received and swapped categories. This assists in narrowing down the results, making it easier to locate particular transactions.Step 3: Click any individual transaction to scrutinize its details.Viewing transaction histories by downloading a blockchainThe Bitcoin network will be used for illustrative purposes.Step 1: Start the initial block download (IBD) process, which involves downloading the entire blockchain and then verifying the blocks. Although the installation process provides a wallet, it only stores and records transactions after installation.Step 2: Open the Bitcoin blocks subdirectory to view transaction history. Note that it will show all Bitcoin transactions, not just the users’.Since the transactions are indecipherable as they are .dat files, build or link a wallet interface/a web front end that installs a blockchain explorer UI. The wallet or explorer will visually represent the data, making it easier to understand.Step 3: If the user installed the wallet or blockchain explorer interface, follow the steps provided in the wallet and explorer sections above to view transaction histories.How to find lost crypto transactionsFor an investor, tracking out misplaced or lost cryptocurrency transactions can be a tedious experience. The first thing to do is to review existing records in detail. This includes looking through a cryptocurrency wallet’s transaction history, reviewing exchange statements to look for missing transactions, and looking through emails to find confirmations from exchanges or wallets. The transaction can be tracked using a blockchain explorer for the relevant cryptocurrency if a fragment of the transaction hash or wallet address is known. If investors need help finding the lost transaction history, they may also contact their exchange support or wallet provider. Specialized data recovery services for lost cryptocurrency transactions are also available; however, they should be utilized cautiously because they may involve costs, and scams are unfortunately prevalent in this area. Furthermore, to prevent the headache of lost transactions, investors should diligently maintain organized wallet histories, save all exchange statements, and archive any emails or bank statements related to their cryptocurrency transactions.

FHE: The Future of Encrypted Data Processing? Buterin's Resurface Raises Hopes


							

Vitalik Buterin reignites interest in FHE, encryption tech for calculations on encrypted data.



FHE’s potential applications include secure cloud computing and privacy-preserving data analysis.



Challenges remain for FHE, such as computational cost and security vulnerabilities.




Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has ignited fresh interest in a revolutionary encryption technology called Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Buterin recently resurfaced a 2020 article he authored titled “Exploring Fully Homomorphic Encryption,” prompting discussions about the tech’s potential to transform data security.







FHE’s unique selling point is that It allows users to perform calculations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This opens a world of possibilities for data privacy.



Buterin’s re-promotion of the article occurred because of the fresh interest of the public around FHE’s practical applications. This could be a game-changer for several sectors. Cloud computing could become significantly more secure as sensitive data could be processed in the cloud while remaining encrypted. 



According to Buterin’s article, while FHE’s potential is undeniable but challenges still remain. The computations performed on encrypted data can be computationally expensive and impacting processing speeds. Additionally, FHE is a new technology which requires further research to optimize performance and address security vulnerabilities.









However, Buterin’s focus on FHE gives optimism to the crypto community for the future of data security and privacy. Additionally, Vitalik’s article states that as FHE matures, its applications could extend far beyond the initial areas of interest shaping the way we handle sensitive data in an increasingly cloud-reliant world.



Vitalik has always been one for the safety measures, the founder recently revealed that 90% of his crypto is held in Multi-Sig Service. In a multi-signature solution, users hold some keys but are unable to recover the funds independently. A multi-sig solution is recommended to minimize the personal risks associated with hardware wallets.

This is Why MakerDAO Sold $31.20 Million in MKR


MakerDAO has recently executed substantial sales of its governance token, MKR. According to the on-chain analytical platform Spot On Chain, MakerDAO’s Multisign 0xbba deposited a significant 750 MKR, valued at $2.19 million, to Binance. This transaction happened through a middle wallet – 0x1cc at a price of $2,920.
This action is part of a broader trend that has garnered attention within the industry. 
Price Impact on MKR
Spot On Chain observed that since its resurgence on March 18, 2024, the multisign has consistently deposited MKR tokens. The deposits total a staggering 11,993 MKR, valued at $31.18 million at an average price of $3,184. These deposits often precede a price drop, indicating a strategic approach to managing market movements.
During this period, a notable transfer involved 9,043 MKR, amounting to $29.75 million, which flowed from Wintermute Trading OTC to various centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken between March 18 and April 22. Additionally, 2,950 MKR, valued at $8.43 million, was directly deposited into Binance via the intermediary wallet 0x1cc in the last 11 days.

Despite these transactions, the multisign still retains a substantial 18,978 MKR, worth over $60 million.
This flurry of activity coincides with MakerDAO’s plans to introduce two new tokens – NewStable (NST) and NewGovToken (NGT). NST, an upgraded version of Dai, promises enhanced stability features for broader adoption. On the other hand, NGT represents a revamped governance model aimed at fostering wider participation and dynamic decision-making within MakerDAO’s ecosystem.
Dai holders can seamlessly upgrade to NST, while MKR holders can convert each MKR into 24,000 NGT, promoting broader engagement in governance activities.


“These additions represent an expansion and will not replace the existing Dai (DAI) and Maker (MKR) tokens. Users will have the option to transition to NewStable and NewGovToken,” MakerDAO wrote.

Despite recent market fluctuations that saw MKR dip by approximately 28% from its April highs, there are indications of a potential reversal. 
Technical analysis points to the formation of a bullish cup and handle pattern, with a breakout from the neckline potentially pushing prices up by nearly 14% to $3327. However, failure to breach this level could see support forming around $2,700.

Bitcoin’s transaction count hits a historic 1 billion, underscoring its utility and security.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Sees Positive Inflow After 11 Weeks, Sparking Optimism for BTC Price
On the other side, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) finally experienced a positive gain of $63 million after 11 straight weeks of outflows. This shift comes amid strong competition from spot Bitcoin ETFs that have gained popularity since January, impacting GBTC’s market position. Despite recent losses, GBTC remains the largest Bitcoin spot ETF with $18.7 billion in assets and around 297,000 bitcoins. Meanwhile, the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holds $17.2 billion. To regain ground, Grayscale proposes a “mini” Bitcoin ETF with lower fees. This positive news for Grayscale surprised the market, with some analysts expressing astonishment at GBTC’s turnaround.











Thus, the positive inflow into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) signalled renewed investor interest and confidence, contributing to upward pressure on the BTC price amidst competition from spot Bitcoin ETFs.













Bitcoin‘s current pivot point stands at $64,655, keeping bitcoin price prediction bearish under this level and bullish above this. Should Bitcoin surpass this level, it will encounter resistance at $67,084, followed by $69,356, and $71,309.

Conversely, support levels are identified at $61,531, $59,164, and $56,677, which will be crucial if the downward pressure persists. 
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 61, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions, while the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $61,652 could offer additional support. 
The market sentiment is bearish below $64,655, but crossing above this could shift to a more bullish outlook.

Bitcoin: good news for Grayscale's ETF

Good news for Bitcoin came over the weekend from Grayscale’s ETF. 
Indeed, quite unexpectedly, on Friday, May 3rd, there were recorded 63 million dollars of inflows towards the world’s largest Bitcoin ETF. 


The latest news on Bitcoin: Grayscale ETF outflows 
Since it was transformed into an ETF on January 11, 2024, the Grayscale fund on Bitcoin has recorded a long consecutive series of outflows.
It is enough to say that on January 10th he owned about 620,000 BTC, while now he only owns a little over 290,000, which is less than half. 
The outflows began on the very day of the stock market debut in the form of ETFs, so much so that already the next day they were forced to liquidate more than 2,300 BTC. 
Since then, practically during all daily stock market sessions, outflows had occurred, with a peak on January 23 followed the next day by a single daily liquidation of almost 16,000 BTC. 
Starting from the end of January, outflows began to decrease, reaching a first minimum peak at the end of February. However, at that minimum peak, a daily liquidation of more than 400 BTC followed. 
At the beginning of March, daily settlements returned above 9,000 BTC, only to drop below 300 BTC on April 11th. 
Since then, daily settlements have followed every day, ranging from 400 to 3,000 BTC. 
The trend reversal
No one expected this trend to reverse. 
It was expected that, as investors exited the Grayscale ETF to move to other more convenient ETFs, outflows would decrease, as indeed happened, but that there could be a net daily inflow at some point in this phase seemed really unlikely. 
For example, on Friday, May 3rd, Grayscale’s ETF had still liquidated more than 900 BTC due to outflows from the previous day. And the day before, it had liquidated almost 3,000 in one go. 
The influx on Friday, which has not yet been followed by a purchase of BTC due to the weekend break, was a real bolt from the blue. 
In fact, the crypto markets reacted well to the news, which was released on Saturday morning when traditional stock exchanges were already closed for the weekend. 
Actually, already on Friday evening the price of Bitcoin had risen with a single leap from $59,000 to about $62,000, but for other reasons. Also during the day on Friday it had risen up to $63,000.
On Saturday, however, it reached up to $64,500, both due to the positive news regarding Grayscale’s ETF, and simply continuing the upward trend started the day before. 
Between yesterday and today, however, the price has remained stable at around $64,000. 
The other ETFs
It should not be forgotten that while Grayscale’s ETF liquidated almost 330,000 BTC in less than four months, the other new ETFs landed on the stock exchange on January 11 acquired more than 500,000.
So it was not at all a flight of investors from ETFs on Bitcoin, but only a shift from an ETF with high costs (Grayscale’s GBTC) to others with much lower costs.
Indeed, overall, the Bitcoin ETF sector has attracted a lot of net capital inflows in recent months, ending up acquiring about 200,000 net BTC, including the 330,000 liquidated by GBTC. 
Furthermore, last Tuesday some ETFs on Bitcoin and Ethereum also made their debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange, although it was not a great success.
However, with the launch in Hong Kong on April 30th, perhaps one phase has ended and another has begun. 
Actually, one had already been concluded by the end of January, but the first two phases had been completely dominated by American markets. 
The point now is that a second phase may have started in which Chinese markets could also play an important role. 
At this moment, Chinese markets from this point of view are still playing only a very marginal role, to the point of being almost irrelevant, but they have started a process that could also assume considerable dimensions in the medium to long term. 
Chinese residents who do not reside in Hong Kong, who are the vast majority, are still precluded from accessing Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.
However, if this process started on April 30th were to conclude, as many believe, with the total opening of these products to all Chinese, China could become the second market in the world after the USA, playing a very significant role.
In such a scenario, it is not surprising at all that in recent days the crypto markets are reacting well to the news coming from the world of ETFs.

Bitcoin surpasses one billion transactions in its 15-year history

The Bitcoin Blockchain has surpassed one billion transactions processed after 15 years of its history. The transaction count does not include those processed on the Lightning Network. 

Bitcoin: one billion transactions after 15 years of its history
On May 5, 2024, after 15 years of its history, the Bitcoin Blockchain has surpassed one billion transactions.

“#Bitcoin has officially processed over 1 billion transactions.”
According to the data reported in the video, the billionth transaction processed on the Bitcoin Blockchain was mined in block 842,241 at 9:34 PM UTC on May 5th. 
Exactly, this milestone was reached after 15 years, four months, and four days that the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin (BTC), Satoshi Nakamoto, mined the first block of the network on January 3, 2009.
Obviously, the count of one billion transactions for Bitcoin does not include those processed on the Lightning Network, the layer 2 of Bitcoin for micropayments, but only those on the Blockchain. 
Instead, over its 5,603 days of existence, Bitcoin has processed an average of 178,475 daily transactions.
Bitcoin: the new milestone of one billion transactions reached after 15 years of history
Only in the last year, among the main factors that have allowed the Bitcoin network to reach and exceed 1 billion transactions, there are innovative protocols like Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes. 
For example, with just the Runes protocol, launched in conjunction with the fourth Bitcoin halving on April 20th at block 840,000, the network recorded an increase in BTC transactions of +57%, just on that day.
Rune is a new standard for Bitcoin tokens that allows you to embed data directly into Bitcoin transactions, going beyond simple financial transactions and allowing for the inclusion of additional information.
However, Bitcoin is not the first blockchain to surpass one billion transactions. Ethereum, launched in 2015, has already surpassed 2 billion transactions. 
The price of BTC
Meanwhile, the price of BTC seems to be recovering, registering a pump of +2.80% in the last seven days. 
Actually, at the time of writing, BTC is trading at a price of $64,172, still far away from its all-time high of over $73,000 reached in mid-March. But it is certainly recovering, compared to the $57,000 touched during these first days of May. 
And speaking of his price predictions, recently, veteran trader Peter Brandt talked about a drop to as low as $30,000 or to the lows of 2021, for the “exponential decay” phase of the Bitcoin cycle.
On the contrary, the experts from the Finder survey, have predicted that the price of BTC will rise to $109,141 by the end of 2024, $150,996 by 2025, and $567,489 by 2030.

Mercado Libre is moving forward with a $29 million investment in Bitcoin

Mercado Libre, one of the largest e-commerce operators in Latin America, reported revenue of 29 million dollars in Bitcoin (BTC) in a recent communication to the SEC.
This indicates a further push towards the institutional integration of Bitcoin in asset management. Additionally, other important financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon and BNP Paribas, have announced significant investments in Bitcoin-based ETF funds.
Let’s see below all the details. 

The e-commerce giant Mercado Libre and investments in Bitcoin
As anticipated, the recent statement to the SEC by Mercado Libre reveals an investment of 29 million dollars in Bitcoin as of March 31st. Highlighting the increasing institutional integration of cryptocurrencies in asset management.
Furthermore, this information, which confirms the adoption of the cryptocurrency announced by the company in 2021, demonstrates MercadoLibre’s commitment to digital assets, despite market fluctuations.
The latest filings with the SEC highlight the trend of financial institutions including Bitcoin in their wealth management strategies. Major players in the industry such as BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon have disclosed significant holdings in Bitcoin ETFs.
By reporting in this way a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the traditional investment landscape. 
Even smaller companies, such as Quattro Advisors and Legacy Wealth Management, have reported significant holdings in Bitcoin ETFs, indicating that interest in these instruments is growing.
As the mid-May deadline for submitting 13F applications approaches, it is expected to have a clearer view of institutional strategies regarding investments in cryptocurrencies.Remember that 13F applications are requests for institutions managing at least 100 million dollars. 
The recent filing by MercadoLibre, along with the interest of other major players in Bitcoin ETFs, suggests that this trend towards integration of Bitcoin into wealth management is set to grow.
The recovery of Bitcoin and the impact of the labor market on cryptographic assets
Recent data shows that the cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant changes, with Bitcoin gaining ground while altcoins record modest gains. 
These trends emerge in a context of US economic relations that reveal challenges in the labor market. 
The market analyst Van de Poppe suggests that the recent drop in Bitcoin may have reached its lowest point, influenced by economic indicators.
The US economic data for April shows that unemployment has increased to 3.9%, while the growth of average hourly wages has been lower than expected. 
These developments, together with a slight deceleration of inflation, could favor interest in assets such as cryptocurrencies. 
Van de Poppe believes that the Federal Reserve could respond with measures such as quantitative easing or interest rate cuts, which could further support the growth of Bitcoin and altcoins.
Bitcoin is back above 61,600 dollars, showing resilience and potential for further gains. This positive signal could give momentum to altcoins, with a possible rally after the recent consolidation. 
Some analysts predict that, if the Federal Reserve were to adopt easing measures, cryptocurrencies could benefit from increased interest from investors seeking higher returns.
In other words, with the cryptocurrency market recovering from recent declines, it is expected that Bitcoin and altcoins could reach new highs in the coming months.

Dogecoin's 15% rise in 7 days means THIS for your DOGE holdings - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin’s price increased by more than 15% in the last seven days. 
Most metrics and market indicators looked bullish on DOGE.

Dogecoin [DOGE] investors were rejoicing as the meme coin had a comfortable weekly rally. 
The good news was that the latest price uptick allowed the meme coin to go above a key resistance level, which can result in a macro-bull rally soon. 
Dogecoin breaks a barrier
Dogecoin’s price dipped to $0.12 on the 1st of May, but soon after that, it gained bullish momentum. The uptrend allowed the meme coin to push its price up by 15% in the last seven days. 
According to CoinMarketCap at the time of writing, $0.1635 has a market capitalization of over $23 billion. 
A possible reason behind this surge could have been Elon Musk.
 AMBCrypto reported earlier how Tesla updated the FAQ section on its website, stating that DOGE may now be used to purchase even more Tesla products. 
It was interesting to note that despite the daily price uptick, sentiment around DOGE remained bearish, as evident from the dip in its Weighted Sentiment. 
Its Social Volume also declined after spiking on the 4th of May.
Source: Santiment
Rekt Capital, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet that gave hopes for a further rise in the meme coin’s price.
 As per the tweet, Dogecoin has just flipped a multi-year resistance into new support, putting an end to its macro downtrend. 
The tweet also mentioned that this development has now confirmed a macro uptrend for DOGE, which might allow it to reach new highs in the coming months. 
Dogecoin’s possible weekly targets
Though the macro-uptrend has begun, it would be ambitious to hope DOGE touches an all-time high anytime soon. Therefore, AMBCrypto analyzed DOGE’s metrics to find which way it was headed this week. 
Our analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the meme coin’s MVRV ratio turned positive. This meant that more investors were in profit. 
Its velocity also shot up, indicating that DOGE was used more often in transactions within a set time frame.
Source: Santiment
A few of the technical indicators also looked pretty bullish. For instance, the MACD displayed a clear bullish crossover. 
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick, indicating that the chances of a continued price surge were high. However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) was bearish as it remained under the neutral mark.

Realistic or not, here’s DOGE’s market cap in BTC’s terms  

To see the possible targets DOGE might reach if the bull rally continues. Our analysis of Hyblock Capital’s data revealed that it will be crucial for DOGE to cross $0.1669, as liquidation would rise sharply at that level.
 A successful breakout above that mark would open the door for DOGE to touch $0.18 or $0.19.

LayerZero Tells Sybil Farmers To Out Themselves Or Face Airdrop Exclusion - The Defiant

Sybil farmers that self-report will still receive 15% of their intended airdrop allocation.The development team behind LayerZero Labs, the popular cross-chain interoperability protocol, has vowed to weed out sybil farmers ahead of its upcoming airdrop.On May 3, LayerZero Labs announced it will conduct an internal investigation intended to identify sybil farmers and exclude them from receiving allocations as part of its future token generation event. The project said it will then follow up with a reward program offering 10% of sybil farmers’ intended token allocation as a reward for bounty hunters who identify additional sybil users.“Almost 6 million unique wallet addresses have interacted with LayerZero since its initial launch over two years ago,” LayerZero Labs said. “We believe it is in the protocol’s best interest to distribute tokens to durable users — not sybil farmers,” the team added via tweet.Sybil farming refers to the practice of creating multiple wallets controlled by a single user to generate large volumes of activity on a network or protocol in a bid to maximize their airdrop allocation.In 2022, Optimism disqualified more than 17,000 wallets suspected of engaging in sybil activity from its airdrop — equating to 6.83% of wallets eligible for the token drop. In September, 21,877 wallets were accused of comprising a sybil network farming activity on ZkSync Era, with the wallets found to be transacting a closed-source token amongst each other using a private decentralized exchange.LayerZero Labs flagged a variety of on-chain activity as grounds for exclusion from its drop, including a single entity participating in “industrial farming” via multiple wallets, users that minted “‘valueless’ NFT[s]” for the sole purpose of moving it between networks, users that repeatedly bridged a minuscule value of assets between chains, and users interacting with well-known sybil farming applications.“If you think you are a sybil, you are most likely a sybil,” LayerZero Labs said.However, LayerZero Labs said sybil farmers can self-report through signed on-chain messaging until May 18 and still receive 15% of their intended airdrop allocation. The project will also provide an API allowing industrial farmers to self-report.LayerZero Labs also noted that airdrop eligibility will be subject to “legal or geographic requirements,” suggesting that sybil farmers operating from countries posing regulatory risks such as the United States or North Korea may have little to gain from self-reporting.LayerZero announced it had taken the first snapshot for its long-awaited airdrop last week. In December, the project said it would distribute a token to early adopters in the first half of 2024, suggesting the event will take place within the next eight weeks.

South Korea Says No to Crypto Donations | Coinspeaker



The updated law welcomes donations in local government-issued, KRW-pegged stablecoins and blockchain-based gift vouchers.

South Korea has taken a firm stance on the use of cryptocurrencies for charitable donations within the country.  According to a local news media outlet, Kyunghyang Shinmun, the government has scrapped the use of digital assets for philanthropic causes in a proposed amendment of the “Donations Act”.
The Ministry of the Interior and Safety said it reviewed and amended the “Donations Act” to broaden the scope of acceptable donations but this does not include digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC).




South Korea Says No Crypto Donations
The original Donations Act was introduced in 2006 before the widespread use of smartphones and the availability of various payment methods. However, the tables have turned with recent inventions, including the launch of cryptocurrencies in 2009, as the rules do not cover the many payment options available in the market.
As a result, the Ministry revisited the Donations Act, proposing new measures in January 2024 that do not allow digital assets despite the burgeoning crypto market in South Korea. However, the updated law welcomes donations in local government-issued, KRW-pegged stablecoins and blockchain-based gift vouchers. It also supports traditional bank transfers and online payments.
According to the report, the regulations also come with automated response systems, postal services, and logistics services. If approved by the State Council after a legislative notice by June 10, the proposed law will become effective in July.
“We plan to proceed with procedures to ensure that the enforcement ordinance is passed before the end of July, and it will be implemented immediately after passage,” said a spokesperson from the country’s Ministry of Public Administration and Security.
South Korea to Accept Gift Cards for Donations
Starting in July, individuals looking to donate to charitable causes will have various alternative methods, including department store gift vouchers, stocks, and loyalty points from Korean internet giant Naver.
The amended law also outlines the specific purposes for collecting donations, including supporting children, adolescents, and people with disabilities, promoting employment, addressing low birth rates, aging populations, and rural decline, revitalizing local communities, and other public interest purposes.
Additionally, the legislation designated the second Monday of December every year as “Donation Day”, allowing national and local governments to organize commemorative events and provide rewards for donors.
Meanwhile, the exclusion of cryptocurrencies from accepted payments for charity donations in South Korea comes at a time when digital asset donations are gaining momentum globally. According to TheGivingBlock, more than $2 billion has been donated using virtual assets as of January 2024.

                        Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter, has stepped down from Bluesky’s board, the decentralized social media platform he originally envisioned and funded back in 2019 during his tenure as CEO of Twitter.In a Sunday post on the platform, Bluesky confirmed Dorsey’s departure from its board.“We sincerely thank Jack for his help funding and initiating the bluesky project. Today, Bluesky is thriving as an open source social network running on atproto, the decentralized protocol we have built,” the post read. Dorsey Provides No Reasons for Departure
Notably, neither Bluesky nor Dorsey provided reasons for his departure.Prior to the official announcement, Dorsey responded with a brief “no” to a query on X about his current status on Bluesky’s board. Meanwhile, Dorsey’s recent activity on X, where he promoted grants for open interest protocols and referred to the social network now owned by Elon Musk as “freedom technology,” garnered attention. Observers noted that Dorsey had significantly trimmed down his follow list on the platform, retaining only three individuals: Musk, Stella Assange (wife of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange), and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.Dorsey’s decision to maintain Musk on his follow list, coupled with his endorsement of X, suggests a possible reconciliation between the two tech figures. This comes after Dorsey publicly criticized Musk’s management of X last year, expressing disapproval of the board’s decision to sell the platform to him.Bluesky, initially announced by Dorsey in late 2019, aimed to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. However, it wasn’t until March 2023 that Bluesky entered beta testing, finally becoming available to the public on February 7, 2024. Despite its relatively recent launch, Bluesky boasts around 5.6 million users, according to its own statistics.Dorsey’s Block Expands Bitcoin Mining Ambitions
Dorsey’s departure from Bluesky’s board comes as his payments company Block has shifted its focus from designing chips to developing a full Bitcoin mining system.As reported, Block has unveiled its accomplishment of designing a standalone three-nanometer (3nm) Bitcoin mining chip and disclosed that it is currently collaborating with a leading global semiconductor foundry to finalize the chip’s design. However, the company’s mining project doesn’t stop at chip development. It plans to expand its efforts to include system design as well.It is worth noting that Dorsey has also been deeply involved in the cryptocurrency space. In addition to his role at Twitter, Dorsey served as the CEO of Square Inc., a financial services company that developed the popular mobile payment app, Cash App. Under his leadership, Square became one of the earliest mainstream companies to embrace Bitcoin, enabling users to buy, sell, and hold the cryptocurrency directly within the Cash App.Dorsey’s personal interest in Bitcoin is well-known, and he has been an outspoken advocate for its adoption and potential to revolutionize the financial industry. He has often highlighted Bitcoin’s role as a decentralized and inclusive form of currency, advocating for its use as a hedge against inflation and government overreach.

A Deep Dive Into ERC-6551 : The Future of NFTs

These one-of-a-kind digital items, securely stored on a blockchain have captured attention due to their ability to represent anything from artwork to real estate in the form of verifiable tokens. However, NFTs offer more than proof of ownership and transferability. With the introduction of token standards like ERC 6551, the capabilities and future potential of NFTs are expanding.
ERC-6551 is a token standard designed specifically for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This standard enables each NFT to possess its unique on-chain identity within the blockchain ecosystem and facilitates interactions, with smart contracts. Under this standard, every ERC 721 token (another type of NFT) is associated with its own smart contract known as a “token-bound account.” To put it simply ERC 6551 empowers individual NFTs to function as self-contained “Web3 wallets.”

In the world of blockchain, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a concept that is transforming our perception of digital asset ownership. 

How Does ERC-6551 Differ From ERC-721?
ERC 6551 differs from ERC 721 in that it enables the creation of contract accounts for each ERC 721 token, which leads to token-bound accounts (TBAs). TBAs allow NFTs to possess assets engage with contracts and have their distinct, on-chain identity. Furthermore, ERC 6551 utilizes a permissionless registry that’s compatible with blockchain platforms enabling NFTs to interact with different blockchain ecosystems. 
Moreover, TBAs have the ability to incorporate rules that dictate the requirements, for receiving Ether while also following established Ethereum protocols. These protocols ensure a TBA interface. Grant execution permissions exclusively, to owner accounts. On the other hand, ERC 721 NFTs can only be transferred without any capacity to own assets interact with smart contracts adapt according to external factors, or respond to user inputs.

Master the art of NFT valuation and ensure accurate assessments for your digital assets. Gain essential insights and strategies with this comprehensive article.


Advantages Of ERC-6551 In NFTs
Functionality like Smart Contract Wallets

Just like smart contract wallets, ERC 6551 tokens can hold similar functions. These functions can include holding tokens and other NFTs.
Better Interactivity for NFTs

With ERC 6551, NFTs have the ability to own assets and interact with applications. This elevates their interactivity and dynamism. The adoption and usage of NFTs are expected to increase due to these capabilities.
Introduction of TBAs

The token-bound accounts that are linked to particular NFTs under ERC 6551, combine tokens, assets, and NFTs into a single account. This integration allows users to easily switch between platforms and transfer assets. This in turn results in a better user interface.

Learn essential strategies for safeguarding your NFT investments in the volatile landscape of Web3 digital assets, empowering you to navigate confidently, with this comprehensive article.

Cross Chain Compatibility

The ERC-6551 standard is designed to be compatible with other blockchains,  thus facilitating interaction with various decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.
New Use Cases for NFTs

The introduction of ERC 6551 opens up possibilities for using NFTs in different ways such as representing digital assets within the metaverse or incorporating in-game items within gaming applications.
Better Security Through Token Restrictions

Token-bound accounts allow tokens to be locked exclusively to accounts, enhancing security measures. The tokens are designed to be used under parameters set by the issuer. This helps in ensuring that the tokens are used as intended.
Real-World Use Cases And Examples Of ERC-6551 In Action
Let Us Explore Some Real-Life Scenarios Where the ERC-6551 Standard Can be Put Into Action

Gaming- The ERC 6551 enhances gaming experiences by allowing players to use NFTs for in-game events, player actions, or real-world factors.
Asset management- Managing assets can be challenging when dealing with distinct NFTs. However, by combing all assets, including those, from games into a token-bound account it becomes easier to oversee them. For example, one can categorize NFTs based on the game they belong to or group deck NFTs based on the characteristics of each card.
Linking with benefits- Instead of simply selling NFTs on their own it is possible to add various benefits to them. Not only can NFTs be linked with other NFTs but native tokens like ERC 20 and ETH can also be incorporated. As an illustration, an NFT membership card could be created that offers content or provides exclusive deals for the first purchasers using ETH.


Following are Some Examples of NFT Projects That Have Used ERC-6551
Sapienz
The Sapienz project demonstrates the improved non-fungibility of NFTs. Multiple NFTs can be added to a main NFT’s token-bound account and it can be converted into different wearables and backgrounds.

The Managers
The Managers NFT project employs the ERC-6551 standard to enable NFTs to own other NFTs, participate in DeFi applications, and interact with smart contracts.

CloneX and Doodles
CloneX and Doodles are projects that focus on PFP collectibles and can take advantage of the increased utility of their NFTs by rewarding holders with token-bound accounts. They can airdrop incentives and rewards directly to holders in their collection, incentivizing engagement and loyalty even further.



Since ERC 6551 is a standard it faces some challenges:
Limited Support & Integration Complexity
Not all wallets and exchanges currently support ERC 6551. This means that users looking to utilize ERC 6551 tokens may need to rely on wallets or exchanges that have implemented this standard. This can pose difficulties, for existing crypto and web3 projects in their transition to this token standard.
Security Concerns
Due to its novelty and limited testing there are risks, errors, and security vulnerabilities associated with this standard.

Despite these challenges, ERC 6551 holds the potential to revolutionize the NFT industry by introducing interactive features for NFTs. Additionally, it empowers ERC 721 NFTs with the capabilities of an Ethereum account, through token-bound accounts. As the crypto community continues to explore and innovate with this token standard we can anticipate enhancements and exciting use cases emerging in the future.
The Future Prospects And Adoption Of ERC-6551 In The NFT Ecosystem
As NFTs evolve and new use cases emerge, ERC-6551 offers exciting opportunities for creators, collectors, and investors. However, it is important to acknowledge that there may be challenges to overcome including the technical complexity and compatibility with existing technology. Like any technology, ERC 6551 will require time to gain adoption and for developers, creators, and users to fully engage with this new standard. Nevertheless, its potential to transform the NFT landscape is undeniable.

Additionally, we may see an integration between NFTs and augmented reality technologies resulting in a more immersive experience for users. Furthermore, various industries such as estate, finance, and even voting systems could find applications, for NFTs.
In general, ERC 6551 represents a progression, in the realm of NFTs. It enables NFTs to operate as their contract accounts thereby introducing a wide array of fresh possibilities and functionalities.
Conclusion
In conclusion, ERC 6551 serves as an upgrade for NFTs that enhances their dynamism, interactivity, and versatility. This novel standard empowers NFTs to possess assets collaborate with contracts and engage with blockchain platforms. Although it is still early in its development ERC 6551 brings forth prospects for NFTs. As more individuals gain an understanding of the potential of NFTs they are becoming increasingly popular and valuable across industries and aspects of our lives. This is indeed an exciting time, for the world of NFTs!

Important Shiba Inu Metric Explodes by 4,000%: What About the SHIB Price?


																TL;DR

Shiba Inu’s burn rate skyrockets, removing millions of tokens on a daily scale, part of a larger effort to reduce supply and enhance value.
Shibarium development advances with upgrades aimed at improving speed, scalability, and transaction fees, potentially contributing to SHIB’s recent price increase.


SHIB Burn Rate Going Through the Roof
The popular meme coin – Shiba Inu – witnessed another substantial burn rate increase. Data shows that it skyrocketed by over 4,000% in the past 24 hours, resulting in over 81 million tokens removed from circulation. 
The program has been quite successful as of late, with almost 1.7 billion SHIB assets destroyed throughout April. Its ultimate goal is to reduce the tremendous supply of the meme coin, making it scarcer and possibly more valuable in the future.
SHIB’s price has climbed 6% weekly and over 150% since May last year. The asset remains the second-largest in the meme coin cohort, with a market capitalization nearing $15 billion.





SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko
Shibarium’s Potential Role
Another element that could have positively contributed to the latest revival of Shiba Inu’s price is the development of the layer-2 scaling solution – Shibarium. The network, which aims to elevate the token above its rivals in the meme coin realm by improving speed, enhancing scalability, and lowering transaction fees, recently underwent two essential upgrades.
The first one occurred in mid-April when the team launched a new user interface (UI) update, describing it as “faster, smoother, and more accessible than ever.” The goal was to enhance compatibility with popular self-custody wallets, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. 
Shortly after, the developers introduced another advancement through a “hard fork.” It aims to improve user experience, empower the community of developers and innovators, and implement quicker block processing times.
“We are also smoothing out transaction fee variations during high traffic times, making costs more predictable and fair for everyone. This ensures our platform remains affordable and accessible,” the team added.

FTX and Binance Founders’ Fall Signifies Crypto’s Illicit Sides


							

FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao faced prison sentences of 25 years and 4 months, respectively.



The crypto titans who once ruled the crypto world fell following stringent regulatory scrutiny.



Lawyer Braden Perry highlights that these cases show the dark and illicit corners of crypto.




FTX’s Sam Bankman Fried and Binance’s Changpeng Zhao, once the rulers of the crypto world, recently faced legal challenges and prison sentences, showcasing the space’s unpredictable nature. With the court ruling 25 years of imprisonment for Bankman Fried and a 4-month sentence for Zhao, the prolonged battle between the crypto titans reportedly ended in an anticlimactic finish.



Braden Perry, a former senior trial lawyer of CFTC, commented that the cases surrounding Bankman-Fried and Zhao highlight the “dark and illicit corners of crypto.” He added,




 “Comparing CZ and SBF, both figures emerged as prominent in the cryptocurrency sector but under vastly different circumstances…The nature of their alleged crimes reflects different aspects of the ‘dark’ and illicit corners of crypto: CZ’s case seems to focus on regulatory and compliance failures, while SBF’s case hinges on direct financial misconduct and deception.” 




For years, both Bankman-Fried and Zhao were at the top of the blockchain industry. They were very popular among crypto aspirants as they simplified the complexities of the crypto ecosystem.



FTX, which stood at the pinnacle of success, collapsed in 2022, leading to a protracted crypto winter. Similarly, Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges, faced regulatory headwinds in 2023 when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against the firm for allegedly offering unregistered securities.









Though the FTX founder pleaded not guilty to the charges, he was later convicted of seven criminal counts, including using customer funds. In three weeks, Binance founder was also convicted of violating securities laws, after which he pleaded guilty and stepped down as the exchange’s CEO. Subsequently, both Bankman-Fried and Zhao were sent to prison under different circumstances.

Satoshi-era dormant Bitcoin address wakes up after 10 years

A dormant Bitcoin address dating back to the era when Satoshi Nakamoto was still active has woken up after 10 years. The Bitcoin wallet containing 687 BTC ($43.9 million) transferred its holdings to two different wallets on May 6.The wallet first transferred 625.43 Bitcoin (BTC) to an address starting with bc1qky and the remaining 61.9 BTC to bc1qdc. The movement of funds from very old wallets, especially from the Satoshi era, often sparks curiosity among the crypto community.The term “Satoshi era” relates to the early days after Bitcoin was created when its pseudonymous founder, Nakamoto, was active online in forums. Some Satoshi-era wallets are often speculated to be linked to Satoshi himself.One such wallet woke from dormancy in August 2023 after almost 14 years and transferred 1,005 BTC mined in 2010. The wallet movement created the most buzz on social media, with speculation that it was Satoshi’s wallet. However, experts suggest it is more likely associated with early miners or buyers just trying to make a profit.According to a Fortune report, a total of 1.75 million Bitcoin wallets have remained inactive for over a decade. Many of these wallets contain significant BTC holdings estimated to be bought when the BTC price was trading in double digits and is currently valued in millions. These dormant wallets contain 1,798,681 Bitcoin worth around $121 billion at today’s price.Source: ChainalysisRelated: 100%+ BTC price gains? Bitcoin faces ‘massively overvalued’ stocksOver the past couple of years, numerous Satoshi-era wallets have been activated only to transfer the BTC holdings to a new address. Some of these wallets were also found to have transferred their BTC holdings to crypto exchanges, which suggests they might be looking to take profits after nearly a decade.Source: ChainalysisIn July 2023, a wallet dormant for 11 years transferred $30 million in BTC. In November 2023, three Satoshi-era BTC wallets transferred $230 million in BTC after six years of dormancy. The three wallets are believed to be connected to the same individual or organization, as they made their last transactions on Nov. 5, 2017.Magazine: The value of a legacy: Hunting down Satoshi’s Bitcoin

Ripple v. SEC case update as of May 6, 2024


With the legal dispute between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple far from over, the blockchain company has filed further support of its motion to strike new expert materials and in reply to the securities watchdog’s opposition to this motion.
Indeed, after the SEC filed its opposition to Ripple’s request to strike the declaration by the regulator’s witness, Andrea Fox, arguing that it did not constitute undisclosed expert testimony, Ripple’s legal team filed a letter in support of its motion, as per the document shared by defense attorney James K. Filan on May 2.

Specifically, the document argues that, in the opposition, on which Finbold reported earlier, the “SEC has failed to show that the Declaration of Andrea Fox (…) is summary evidence rather than expert testimony, or that it was timely under the Court’s scheduling order.”


Ripple’s counter-arguments
As Ripple’s lawyers explained, “Fox is an expert because she purports to use ‘technical or other specialized knowledge’ to ‘help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.’ She does not merely apply basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records,’ as the SEC contends.”

“Rather, she analyzes Ripple’s records, third-party evidence, and expert reports; draws inferences and conclusions about those documents; and calculates disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and discount amounts based on her analysis.”

Upon listing several examples to substantiate that Fox’s declaration is, in fact, an expert testimony, including her qualifications as an accountant as part of her testimony “merely to show that she could do basic arithmetic,” Ripple’s legal team also accused the regulator of using wordplay to argue its side.

“The agency asserts that because it reserved its right to ‘submit the declaration of a summary witness,’ as opposed to ‘serv[ing] a rebuttal expert report,’ it could wait until its remedies motion to do so. If the SEC really meant ‘submit’ to lay the groundwork for a summary witness disclosure after the close of discovery, its proposal was misleading.”

Meanwhile, the deadline for the SEC to file its response is coming up, as Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn has set it for May 6, 2024. In the view of legal expert Bill Morgan, “Ripple will lose the motion but the judge will accept Fox gave some expert evidence and permit Ripple to depose her.”

At press time, XRP, the token at the center of the Ripple v. SEC courtroom standoff, was trading at $0.54, up 2.57% on the day, gaining 7.78% over the week, as it moves to reverse the loss of 8.89% accumulated in the last month, according to the latest charts retrieved by Finbold on May 6.

Bitcoin mining revenue hits post-halving yearly low

Earnings from Bitcoin mining dropped significantly in May as the effects of the fourth Bitcoin halving event set in. The Bitcoin halving mechanism was designed to increasingly limit the issuance of 21 million Bitcoin (BTC) spread over decades. The April 20 halving reduced mining rewards to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC. While initial hype around the halving and the launch of Bitcoin Runes temporarily sustained the miners’ daily earnings, a strong revenue drop was recorded in May. On May 1, the total revenue earned from block rewards and transaction fees fell to a new low of $26.3 million. In contrast, Bitcoin miners earned roughly $6 million per day on average before the halving, according to data sourced from Blockchain.com.Total value in United States dollars of Coinbase block rewards and transaction fees paid to miners. Source: blockchain.comAll the other days in May also recorded similar revenue patterns, signaling a new normal in Bitcoin mining revenue. Coincidentally, mining revenue peaked on April 20, marking an all-time high daily earnings of over $107 million for the first time in Bitcoin history. Anticipating this significant drop, miners worldwide restrategized operations to remain profitable in the next phase of the Bitcoin economy. If not, miners would have to rely solely on Bitcoin’s high market value to support operations. Read Cointelegraph’s guide to learn more about being a profitable Bitcoin miner from home.CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju calculated that Bitcoin needs to hold above $80,000 to keep mining profitable post-halving under current conditions. However, most miners took proactive measures to upgrade their mining equipment to reduce long-term operational costs while being competitive. Related: Bitcoin reaches one billion transactionsFor example, Bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms allotted $240 million to triple its hash rate. Previously speaking to Cointelegraph, Bitfarms chief financial officer Jeffrey Lucas laid out the firm’s drive to procure 88,000 highly efficient Bitcoin miners:“The transformational fleet upgrade propels Bitfarms in scale and profitability amid the Bitcoin halving. This is a game changer that triples our hash rate to 21 EH/s, increases our targeted operating capacity by 83% to 440 megawatts (MW), and improves fleet efficiency by 40% to 21 w/TH.”Despite the effort, Bitfarms recorded its lowest monthly earnings of 269 Bitcoin in over two years in April.Magazine: CZ gets jail sentence, Gensler viewed Ether as security, and FBI targets mixers: Hodler’s Digest, April 28 – May 4

Here's When Bitcoin Could Peak In This Accelerated Bull Run


                            The current Bitcoin price behavior and its deviations from expected cyclical patterns remain a central theme of analysis. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) recently shared new insights on X concerning Bitcoin’s potential peak during the ongoing bull run, which is progressing at an atypical pace compared to historical data.
When Will Bitcoin Peak This Cycle?
In a detailed post, Rekt Capital pointed out that as of mid-March 2024, Bitcoin had not only reached new all-time highs but had done so approximately 260 days ahead of its traditional halving-induced cycles. This marked a significant acceleration. “When Bitcoin rallied to new All Time Highs in mid-March 2024, Bitcoin was accelerating in its cycle by 260 days compared to traditional Halving Cycles,” stated Rekt Capital.
However, this rapid pace has not been sustained. Over the past two months, Bitcoin has been in a phase of consolidation, which has altered its trajectory. The acceleration advantage has decreased to about 210 days compared to previous cycles. This deceleration is a critical factor, as it could lead to a re-synchronization with the typical halving cycle. Typically, BTC peaks 518-546 days after a halving event.

The analyst suggests shifting the predictive focus from just halving events to the periods after Bitcoin surpasses its previous all-time highs. Historically, BTC price tends to reach a bull market top within 266 to 315 days after breaking these thresholds. Given that this milestone was achieved again in mid-March 2024, the projected window for the next bull market peak could be set between late November 2024 and late January 2025.
Nevertheless, a notable trend is the increasing duration for which Bitcoin maintains levels beyond its old highs. In 2013, this period lasted 268 days, in 2017 it extended to 280 days, and by 2021, it had increased to 315 days.
This pattern suggests an incremental extension of approximately 14 to 35 days per cycle. “Historically, the amount of days that Bitcoin has spent beyond old All Time Highs has increased by approximately 14 days to 35 days,” explained Rekt Capital.

Adding these increments to the initial range of 266 to 315 days post-old highs, the peak could potentially extend to between 280 and 350 days post-breakout. This adjustment shifts the expected peak time frame to between mid-December 2024 and early March 2025.

Potential Synchronization With Halving Cycles
Despite the current accelerated cycle, there remains a possibility that further deceleration could align Bitcoin more closely with its halving cycle. In past cycles, such as those between 2015-2017 and 2019-2021, Bitcoin peaked at 518 and 546 days post-halving, respectively. If Bitcoin’s rate of acceleration continues to decrease, the cycle may eventually resynchronize, potentially delaying the peak to between mid-September and mid-October 2025.
Rekt Capital elaborates, “But if Bitcoin continues to reduce its current acceleration in the cycle, it would resynchronize with traditional Halving cycles.” This could result in a peak more aligned with historical patterns, diverging from the current accelerated timeline.
At press time, BTC traded at $64,262.

Back to extreme greed past $65K? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week

Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week with bullish sentiment back on the radar as $64,000 returns.In a stirring comeback, BTC price action has managed to leave its latest swing lows far behind it, gaining nearly $8,000 versus the pit of last week’s sell-off.Despite some of those gains coming during the weekend, they proved to have staying power, and during the May 6 Asia trading session, bears are having no luck pushing the market back down.The mood is thus considerably different into the second week of May — but increasing greed is already visible.Can Bitcoin and altcoins manage sustainable momentum toward all-time highs?This is the question that traders and analysts will be posing after a trip to two-month lows and a considerable flushing out of leverage.On exchanges, things remain promising — funding rates are neutral, and there are few signs of mass desire to long BTC at current levels.Should things take a turn for the worse, however, it is key support levels which will come in for a fresh test. These include the short-term holder (STH) cost basis and 100-day moving average — both classic bounce levels.Cointelegraph takes a closer look at the current state of Bitcoin as the average trader recovers from a hair-raising start to the month.Bitcoin bulls triumphant after weekly close The weekend ultimately posed no threat to Bitcoin bulls, providing some unexpected upside that ended up holding into the weekly close.BTC/USD 1-hour chart.

Altcoins slowly waking up.”BTC/USD chart.

U.S. Bitcoin ETFs: 'Good' for crypto or not? Analyst weighs in - AMBCrypto



U.S. Bitcoin ETFs elicited mixed signals on the crypto regulatory front. 
Apart from BTC, most of the crypto projects faced regulatory uncertainty. 

The U.S. spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF approval in January continues to elicit mixed feelings about whether it “legitimizes crypto.” 
In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Neel Maitra, a former SEC crypto specialist, said that the January approval was “grudging” and doesn’t look great for the market. 
Part of his speech stated, 
“Its (approval) was grudging, and it was just for Bitcoin, and it’s not good news for the crypto generally.” 
To support his arguments, Maitra mentioned the SEC’s rejection of spot BTC ETFs in the past seven years before the courts forced its hand. 
Additionally, the agency emphasized that the approval was limited to BTC and shouldn’t be read as a general crypto approval. 
Divergent views on Bitcoin ETF impact
However, Franklin Bi, a general partner at Pantera Capital, had a contrarian take. In an interview with “The Block,” the exec claimed that the U.S. spot BTC ETFs approval “validated crypto.” 
He further commented, 
“The approval has really shown people that directionally speaking, regulation is still moving in a positive direction for digital assets.”
The executive added that the approval also convinced many institutional investors that crypto is a long-term technology trend worth exploring. 
True to Bi’s word, U.S. spot BTC ETFs have seen massive interest from institutional players. 
For instance, the leading world asset manager, BlackRock, had an impressive BTC ETF debut and is eyeing the tokenization of real-world assets on the blockchain. 
However, regulatory heat in the industry still exists. Despite the approvals, the SEC has filed lawsuits against Uniswap [UNI] and Consensys’ MetaMask. 
Additionally, the agency has not clearly stated whether Ethereum [ETH] is not a security. This prompted Consensys to sue the SEC and seek clarity from the courts on the status of ETH. 
In a separate development, a new class action lawsuit against Coinbase claims that the exchange misled investors into buying “securities” like Solana [SOL], Near [NEAR], and UNI, amongst others. 
That said, BTC had regulatory clarity after the January ETF approvals. However, several crypto projects and tokens like ETH face regulatory uncertainty.
 Will it take more than ETF approval to validate crypto legitimacy in the U.S.?

Ripple Vs. SEC Legal Saga: Expert Outlines Timeline For Settlement And Ruling | Bitcoinist.com


								Ashley Prosper, an XRP enthusiast deeply invested in the outcome of the legal clash between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), shared insights on the subject, outlining the possible timeline for a settlement and final ruling of the case.
Potential Settlement And Final Ruling Timeline In The Ripple Case
According to the expert, the SEC’s final response in the remedies phase in its case between Ripple is anticipated to be released tomorrow, on May 7. Following the response, US Judge Analisa Torres is expected to make her final decision on the matter, which Ashley Prosper believes will take place between July and August, or possibly September.

While the XRP enthusiast is confident that an appeal could be filed from both parties after this, she affirms it will not require as much time as people anticipate. Thus, she has urged the community to observe between now and any prospective decision from an appeal court, as a settlement could happen at any time within this timeframe.
The expert further drew attention to US attorney James K. Filan’s post highlighting several crucial dates in the legal dispute between Ripple and the regulatory watchdog. Filan pointed out two important dates in the case which are March 22, for which the SEC filed an opening brief, and May 6, for which the agency will file a reply brief.
 It is noteworthy that during the opening brief in March, the SEC argued that the payment had raised its XRP sales since filing the complaint. An astonishing amount of over $729 million in unregistered institutional sales is covered in the Summary Judgment Order, according to the Commission. However, it is insignificant compared to the over-redacted dollar number in XRP sales that Ripple has made since the litigation began, including billions after the Summary Judgement Order, the majority of which appear to be institutional purchases.
Also, the SEC made it clear that Ripple is in a good position to pay a sizable civil penalty. As a result, the Commission requested that the court should forbid the company from offering institutional investors unregistered XRP.
The SEC’s Reply Brief To Take Place Today
Today, May 6, the case is expected to reach a crucial point, as the SEC is scheduled to file a reply brief in response to Ripple’s protests about the significant fines that the commission has suggested. 

The agency is seeking an $876.3 million civil penalty, an additional $876.3 million in disgorgement, and $198.15 million in prejudgment interest, totaling a proposed fine of $1.95 billion. However, the payment company countered the request, claiming the SEC did not demonstrate the need for a disgorgement and that any civil penalty should be limited to a maximum of $10 million.
Though experts believe the SEC will probably stick to its disgorgement position, there are speculations that the court might rule in favor of the firm this time.

Sui Foundation Addresses Concerns Over Token Supply Distribution


							

Sui Foundation ensures transparency by disclosing token allocations, fostering trust in its emission plan.



Locked tokens are strategically utilized to support essential ecosystem functions for growth.



Reinvesting staking rewards promotes fairness despite concerns over distribution raised by some figures.




In response to recent community concerns regarding the token supply of Sui, Wu Blockchain, a crypto news reporter, reports the official statement from Sui addressing the doubts. According to the statement, Mysten Labs’ founder does not control crucial aspects such as the Sui Foundation treasury, stake subsidies, or investor tokens.







However, despite the clarification, there have been discussions on social media platforms regarding the token allocation, especially as Sui marks its one-year milestone. The debate revolves around the influence of Mysten Labs’ founders on various token allocations, including the Sui Foundation treasury and stake subsidies.



The foundation asserts that every token allocation is fully disclosed with a timeline, in alignment with the emission plan. This transparency is aimed at ensuring that all participants have full information regarding the token supply and distribution.



Moreover, the Sui Foundation, as the largest holder of locked tokens in the ecosystem, plays a pivotal role in its growth and development. The foundation utilizes these tokens to support essential guild members, enhance the programming language, bolster network security, and conduct research for the creation of new products. This strategic utilization aims to foster a thriving ecosystem.









Significantly, the staking rewards and transaction fees generated from network activities are reinvested back into the Sui ecosystem by the foundation. This practice promotes equality and fairness among ecosystem participants, ensuring that rewards are shared equitably.



However, concerns have been raised by Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons regarding the fairness of staked Sui supply distribution among the founders. Bons’ concerns, though, were dismissed by Sui, stating that the founding members do not exert control over the token supply. The foundation remains committed to transparency, striving to provide comprehensive information to all stakeholders.







Recent data indicates that over 8 billion SUI tokens have been staked, with the founding team accounting for more than 84% of the staked supply. Nonetheless, these figures reflect the intended distribution mechanism, and the foundation asserts that the founding team’s holdings do not imply disproportionate control over the ecosystem.

Understanding Bitcoin's Halving Cycle: Key Phases and Market Implications | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to the insights of crypto analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin’s much-anticipated halving event continues to be a pivotal catalyst in defining its market dynamics. 



Occurring just over two weeks ago, this event purportedly initiates a cyclical influence on Bitcoin’s price and investor behavior, unfolding in three distinct phases. 



Phase 1: Pre-Halving Retrace



The first phase, the pre-halving retrace, involves a notable price drop, which, in this cycle, was a 23.6% decrease. According to Rekt Capital, this is a moderate decrease compared to the 38% drop in 2016 and the 19% drop in 2020. These retracements are not merely downturns but are critical in setting the stage for what the analyst describes as the re-accumulation range. This phase typically precedes the halving and prepares the market for more stabilized activity post-event.



Phase 2: Re-Accumulation







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Following the halving, the market transitions into what Rekt Capital refers to as the re-accumulation phase. This period is crucial as it establishes the foundation for subsequent price movements. During this phase, Bitcoin’s price consolidates within a defined range, characterized by pullbacks and sideways movements—a reflection of normal range-bound behavior as the market tempers the preceding rally.



Rekt Capital notes that the duration of this phase can span several weeks to months, often ending with a significant price breakout. This stage can challenge investor patience, as many may feel disillusioned by the lack of dramatic price movements or become disenchanted due to the prolonged period of inactivity.



Phase 3: Parabolic Uptrend



The final phase, as highlighted by the crypto analyst, is the parabolic uptrend. This phase marks a period of accelerated growth for Bitcoin, as it breaks out from the re-accumulation range and embarks on a rapid upward trajectory. Historically, according to Rekt Capital, this uptrend has lasted just over a year, around 385 days. However, they believe that current market observations suggest a potentially accelerated cycle that could halve this duration in the current market cycle.

Bitcoin network celebrates 1 billion transactions as a Satoshi-era wallet awakens

Bitcoin network processed its one billionth transaction 15 years after it mined its genesis block in January 2009.Notably, the network achieved this milestone the same day a Satoshi-era Bitcoin address came to life.1 billion transactionsAccording to data from the Bitcoin dashboard on Clark Moody, the network processed its one billionth transaction in block 842,241 at 05:34 UTC+8 on May 6.On average, the network has processed 178,475 transactions daily within the 15 years of its launch.The milestone drew praise from the crypto community, who have set eyes on the next billion target.Tarik Sammour, an associate professor at the University of Adelaide, pointed out that Bitcoin achieved this milestone “flawlessly, securely, and without any centralized intermediary.”Similarly, Matteo Pellegrini, the founder of the Orange Pill App, noted that Bitcoin reached this milestone in 15 years compared to Visa’s 25 years.What is driving Bitcoin transaction volume?In its early years, Bitcoin transactions were mainly driven by users using the coin to move value between themselves. However, that trend has changed recently, thanks to the launch of novel protocols like Ordinals Inscriptions and Runes. These assets have drawn increased attention and interest to the blockchain, spurring high network activities.For context, the Bitcoin blockchain recorded its highest daily transaction volume on April 23, processing over 926,000 transactions, of which approximately 90% stemmed from the Runes protocol.Moreover, the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January this year has also increased the number of transactions the network handles.Satoshi era BTC addressA long-dormant Bitcoin address, originating from the early days of Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation, was recently brought back to life after a decade of dormancy.Once holding 687 BTC valued at $43.9 million, the wallet saw its contents split and transferred to two distinct addresses during the early hours of today, May 6. In this transaction, 625.43 BTC found its way to an address beginning with bc1qky, while the remaining 61.9 BTC headed to bc1qdc.Blockchain investigator Lookonchain reported that the whale first received the 687.33 BTC on Jan. 12, 2014, when the price was $917.Mentioned in this articlePosted In: Bitcoin, Crypto

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is on a major rebound in its burn rate as more than 81 million tokens have been sent to dead wallets. Data from Shiba Inu burn tracker Shibburn pegs the burn rate at 4,085.94% in the past 24 hours.Build up in deflated SHIBEvery Shiba Inu sent to the burn address is designed to contribute to the overall SHIB taken out of circulation. The latest Shiba Inu burnt has pushed the total incinerated to 410,726,232,655,518 SHIB. With this, about 589,273,767,344,481 SHIB is left in circulation.Meeting SHIB investors’ expectations from this incinerated token remains a volatile subject. The 81,649,878 SHIB burnt is worth roughly $2,039, a valuation that is not enough to trigger a significant uptick in the price of the underlying token.Shiba Inu Burn Chart.

It also underscores the community's confidence that when the SHIB burn portal is launched, it will yield the expected results. With the SHIB army burning the tokens willingly, there is expected to be more intense deflation when automatic burning sets in.Ultimate targetThe ultimate target for Shiba Inu with its burn campaign is to shrink the supply to a level where price discovery can be recorded. Shiba Inu proponents are nursing a long-term price of one cent, a price level that is economically impossible at the current supply rate.Pending when this is achieved, the core team behind Shiba Inu led by Shytoshi Kusama is introducing a new utility that can drive demand. The launch of the Shibarium hard fork is one example that can drive adoption with enhanced protocol versatility.At the time of writing, the price of SHIB jumped 0.55% in 24 hours to $0.00002498.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Outperforms Bitcoin and Dogecoin on This Front: Details


																TL;DR

SHIB tops some trading charts for April, surpassing BTC, DOGE, and ETH, showcasing its consistent popularity among traders.
Analysts like Ali Martinez and Rekt Capital anticipate a potential Shiba Inu bull run, with buy orders placed and bullish predictions suggesting triple-digit price increases.


SHIB’s Solid Achievement
Shiba Inu continues to make the headlines by registering substantial price spikes and achieving numerous advancements. 
For example, it topped WazirX’s ranking as the most-traded cryptocurrency for April, leaving Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), and Ethereum (ETH) behind.

This is not the first time the meme coin has topped that ranking. It was the most-traded digital currency on WazirX’s platform in March, surpassing BTC, PEPE, FLOKI, and DOGE. Recall that SHIB was the second-most traded cryptocurrency on the trading venue for 2023.
It is worth mentioning that WazirX is among the leading Indian cryptocurrency exchanges, with over 6 million registered users and monthly trading volume equaling billions of dollars. It is part of the Binance group and serves clients in more than 180 countries.




Recent SHIB Price Predictions
The meme coin’s price has been flashing green for the past few days, with some analysts suggesting that a more substantial rally could be on the horizon. One example is the X user Ali Martinez, who admitted placing buy orders, hoping for a 300% surge.
Rekt Capital and crypto content creator Jake Gagain also outlined bullish predictions recently. The former envisioned a triple-digit price increase, whereas the latter argued that “fading” Shiba Inu “is a major mistake.” 
The resurgence of Shiba Inu‘s burn rate and the development of the layer-2 blockchain solution – Shibarium – are two major factors that could positively impact the asset’s value. As CryptoPotato reported, over 81 million tokens were destroyed in the last 24 hours, while the network underwent two essential upgrades.

Bitcoin’s One Billion Transaction Astonished Crypto Marke...


                                Bitcoin Announced on Completion of One Billion Transaction                                Bitcoin finally recorded its one Billion transactions on its Bitcoin Network setting an example for other Cryptocurrencies. It also highlights the history of 15 years with its one billion hits. What Estimates Bitcoin Shows?The statistics and dynamics shows that Bitcoin recorded 178,475 average transactions on a daily basis which completed one billion counts by existing 5603 days. The dashboard of Clark Moody shows 1 billion transactions on 5 may 2024 which was mined into 842,241 on the same day. Bitcoin is one of the oldest Cryptocurrency Network that recorded one billion transactions.  This number counts to one billion exactly after 15 years, 4 months, and 4 days where Bitcoin’s spurious initiator Satoshi Nakamoto on 3rd January 2009 mined the first and foremost Blockchain Network.One Billion Bitcoin transactions doesn’t include the transactions made on the lightning network that is the Bitcoin layer 2 network which mainly focuses on Micropayments. Lightning Network launched in January 2018 and after that millions of transactions take place on the lightning Network. In August 2023, the statistics showed approximately 6.6 million transactions on lower bounds on the lightning network. On 4th May 2024, the daily transactions of Bitcoin down to 660,260Ethereum Surpasses BitcoinAlthough Bitcoin is the oldest cryptocurrency network that recorded one billion transactions, another network that acts as the biggest rivalry for Bitcoin is Ethereum. It was launched in July 2015 and till then it has processed two billion transactions, as per the data shows. What Contributes To Count Bitcoin to One Billion TransactionsThis accomplishment of one billion signifies Bitcoin's longevity and dominance in the cryptocurrency market. The average daily transactions surged to 178,475 approx. with a notable increase due to the Bitcoin Halving Event and the launch of Bitcoin Runes.On 20th April 2024, the transactions recorded on a daily basis on average hiked after the Bitcoin Halving Event occurred. On 23rd April 2024, the high recording of 926,000 transactions counted authentically in the Crypto market.The demand of Bitcoin also rises after the Bitcoin Runes launched. Bitcoin Runes is a new token protocol built on the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling the creation and management of both fungible and non-fungible tokens. It utilizes the UTXO model, enhancing security and efficiency by managing tokens through unspent transaction outputs. Runes introduces various digital tokens directly on Bitcoin which potentially attracts more developers and users to the network. Bitcoin Runes launched during the Bitcoin halving event help to mitigate the impact on miners by increasing transaction fees.

Bitcoin privacy will survive despite CoinJoin closure - zkSNACKs CEO

The Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem will soon lose an important privacy-enhancing service after zkSNACKs announced that it would discontinue its CoinJoin coordination service.Max Hillebrand, CEO of zkSNACKs, spoke exclusively to Cointelegraph following the announcement and explained that the decision was made to ensure compliance with the latest legal and regulatory updates in the United States. Hillebrand said the closure of the CoinJoin service was necessary given the lack of clarity in the U.S. over regulations pertaining to the cryptocurrency space and the use of privacy-enhancing tools. Former NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was among commentators who lamented the service’s discontinuation.Source: Edward SnowdenThe zkSNACKs CEO said that the Bitcoin ecosystem was inevitably losing an important service that helped users transact with increased privacy through the coinjoin mechanism:“Bitcoin privacy will survive, but cutting back the support from zkSNACKs for Bitcoin developers and privacy educators is a regrettable setback.”Hillebrand also confirmed that Wasabi Wallet, the Bitcoin wallet developed by zkSNACKs that incorporated the CoinJoin service, will continue functioning as a regular BTC wallet. Users can generate private keys to receive and send Bitcoin.Coinjoins offer complete privacyDespite the closure of the CoinJoin service, Hillebrand said that Wasabi’s client-side filtering architecture, Tor integration and custom coin selection still provide significant privacy for users. However, the level of privacy afforded by CoinJoins remains unmatched going forward.“The nature of the Bitcoin blockchain prevents users from obtaining complete privacy without CoinJoins,” Hillebrand conceded.Related: Snowden goes after Bitcoin devs, Elon Musk and puppy killers in X flurryThe zkSNACKs CEO was hesitant to speculate whether similar crackdowns on privacy protocols and CoinJoin services would occur in jurisdictions outside the U.S.The closure of zkSNACK's CoinJoin coordination service also affected products and services across the ecosystem. Hardware wallet services Trezor Suite and BTCPayServer will no longer be able to offer the service to its users from June 2024.Cointelegraph has reached out to Trezor for comment on zkSNACKs' CoinJoin closure and whether it will consider using another Bitcoin privacy-enhancing service for its users.How does CoinJoin work?Hillebrand went into the details of zkSNACKs CoinJoin service during an in-depth interview with Cointelegraph at Bitcoin Amsterdam in 2023. As Hillebrand explained, a CoinJoin service offers an effective method for obfuscating Bitcoin transactions by combining multiple inputs and outputs from several users into a single transaction, making it significantly harder for outside observers to determine specific transaction details.Related: Trezor wallet enables Bitcoin privacy feature with CoinJoinWasabi Wallet was launched in 2018 following extensive research. The wallet uses Tor for anonymity, employs a light client approach for checking balances without compromising privacy, and utilizes block filters to efficiently and securely verify transactions without downloading the entire Bitcoin blockchain.Magazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?

DOJ Cracks Down on Crypto-Linked Money Laundering


The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has escalated its crackdown on international money laundering. Authorities have indicted Maximilien de Hoop Cartier, allegedly linked to the Cartier family, for laundering drug proceeds through cryptocurrency.
In a parallel development, Alexander Vinnik, operator of the BTC-e crypto exchange, pleaded guilty to laundering over $9 billion. These efforts showcase the DOJ’s intensified efforts against financial crimes involving digital currencies.
Cartier Heir Entangled in Multi-Million Dollar Laundering Conspiracy
On May 2, the DOJ charged Maximilien de Hoop Cartier along with five Colombian nationals for their involvement in laundering drug trafficking proceeds between the US and Colombia using cryptocurrency. Claiming descent from the prestigious Cartier family, Maximilien was arrested in Miami. He is now facing a series of grave charges.
The officials accused him of conspiring to commit money laundering and engaging in money laundering activities, each charge carrying a potential twenty-year prison term. Cartier is also facing a bank fraud charge, which could result in up to thirty years of imprisonment.

Additionally, the authorities charged him with conducting a monetary transaction on property derived from specific unlawful activities, which could result in a possible sentence of ten years. Lastly, the DOJ also charged Cartier with operating an unlicensed money-remitting business, which could lead to five years in prison.
Cartier allegedly converted drug proceeds into the stablecoin Tether and then into US dollars. He utilized a network of shell companies and bank accounts in the US for these unlicensed transactions. This scheme involved running an unlicensed over-the-counter cryptocurrency exchange.

US Attorney Damian Williams expressed his thoughts regarding the case. He praised the relentless work of law enforcement and Office prosecutors in tackling money laundering and drug trafficking in Cartier’s case.

“Cartier is additionally alleged to have committed a series of financial offenses while working with this money laundering network that resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of unlawful transactions. I commend the efforts of our law enforcements partners and the career prosecutors from this Office who work tirelessly to investigate and disrupt these money laundering and drug trafficking networks. We will continue to relentlessly protect the US financial system from exploitation,” Williams said.

Besides Cartier, several Colombian nationals are facing serious charges in this case. The DOJ accused Leonardo de Jesus Zuluaga Duque of conspiring to commit money laundering and to import over five kilograms of cocaine into the US. These offenses could result in a life sentence.
Similarly, Alexander Areiza Ceballos and Adrian Fernando Areiza Ceballos face charges of conspiring to import over five kilograms of cocaine into the US. This charge carries a mandatory minimum of 10 years and could lead to life imprisonment.
The authorities have also implicated Erica Milena Lopez Ortiz and Felipe Estrada Echeverry. They each face charges of conspiring to commit money laundering, a crime that carries a punishment of up to 20 years in prison.
BTC-e Exchange Operator Pleads Guilty
Moving on from Cartier’s story, another major development highlights the intricacy of global money laundering. On May 3, the DOJ’s officials announced that Alexander Vinnik, who was associated with BTC-e, had confessed to his involvement in a substantial money laundering operation.

BTC-e was once a notable player in the crypto exchange industry. The DOJ pointed out that BTC-e processed over $9 billion in transactions. Moreover, it served as a financial hub for cybercriminals, ranging from ransomware profiteers to drug traffickers.
Additionally, BTC-e failed to comply with US regulatory standards, including anti-money laundering and customer identification requirements. This failure made it a preferred platform for the anonymization of illicit proceeds.
In discussing Vinnik’s case, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco stressed the international effort required to tackle such complex operations. She also underscored the global collaboration necessary for dismantling sophisticated schemes.

“This guilty plea reflects the Department’s ongoing commitment to use all tools to fight money laundering, police crypto markets, and recover restitution for victims,” Monaco added.

This announcement followed a report by BeInCrypto, which detailed charges brought by the DOJ against Aliaksandr Klimenka, a national of Belarus and Cyprus. The officials alleged he engaged in a complicated money laundering scheme through BTC-e. An indictment in February outlined that Klimenka, alongside Vinnik, managed BTC-e from 2011 until its closure in July 2017.

Read more: How to Choose The Right Crypto Exchange

The recent actions against Cartier and Vinnik demonstrate the Department of Justice’s unwavering dedication. These efforts aim to safeguard the US financial system from the exploitation of high-level international money launderers.
Indeed, cryptocurrency is commonly associated with money laundering by authorities worldwide. However, recent research from Chainalysis in 2023 shows a notable decline in illicit cryptocurrency transactions. Illicit addresses sent $22.2 billion to services, down from $31.5 billion in 2022.

Contrary to the perception that cryptocurrencies are primarily used for money laundering, the US Department of Treasury’s report highlights that criminal organizations prefer traditional cash transactions for such activities. This finding indicates a lower risk associated with cryptocurrency in money laundering compared to conventional methods.

Bitcoin hits massive milestone: One billion transactions processed

Marking an incredible milestone in the history of the world’s first and most valuable cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin network has processed its 1 billionth transaction. That milestone moment came 15 years, four months, and four days after its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, mined the network’s first block on January 3, 2009.Bitcoin growth and adoption Ever since the Bitcoin network was released 5,603 days ago, it never ceased its stride, churning out an average of 178,475 transactions every day. It is important to remember that this figure does not include the number of transactions routed through the Lightning Network, a Bitcoin layer-2 payment protocol designed to facilitate faster transactions.Again, figures from the Bitcoin-only exchange River suggest this is a lower bound estimate—that the Lightning Network cleared 6.6 million transactions in August 2023 alone. This means that since launching in January 2018, hundreds of millions of transactions should have taken place within the Lightning Network.Around the fourth halving event of the network, transactions had a daily all-time high of 926,000 transactions on April 23. This launch at block 840,000 brought demand for the Runes protocol.Market performanceThe Clark Moody Bitcoin dashboard claimed that more than 660,260 transactions were recorded on the blockchain in one single day, a number of new records. The same source also reports that transaction 1,000,000,000 got into block 842,241 at 9:34 p.m. UTC on May 5.Source: Clark MoodyEven though the Bitcoin network is the oldest in the history of cryptocurrencies, it is not the first to process a billion transactions. Its biggest rival, Ethereum, has processed well over two billion transactions since July 2015, according to Etherscan data.As of the time of this writing, Bitcoin exchanges hands near $63,750, up by more than 12% from the two-month low at around $56,800 on May 2, as tracked by CoinGecko. It still remains to be over 13.6% down from the all-time high set at $73,740 on March 13.Source: CoinGeckoIt’s remarkable that such a large number of transactions are processed within the Bitcoin network, which speaks to its strength and acceptance. The ecosystem of cryptocurrencies will only continue to grow from here, making it really interesting to see how Bitcoin, along with other digital assets, adapts to shaping the future of finance.

Ethereum (ETH) Whale Sales Surge: Are Whales Giving up on It? Ethereum (ETH)

Recent on-chain data and trading activity show that Ethereum whales are engaging in substantial sell-offs, raising concerns about their long-term confidence in the asset. One notable transaction involved a whale who, after purchasing ETH at $1,890 last year, moved 12,906 ETH ($24.39 million) from Binance to Lido.More recently, this same investor withdrew 7,000 ETH from Lido and redeposited it onto Binance, securing over $16 million in profits amid a fluctuating market.ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewThe accompanying charts reveal a decline in the number of large transactions alongside a fluctuating price, suggesting a possible correlation between whale activities and price movements. Specifically, the total volume of large transactions has seen a noticeable dip, aligning with periods of price instability.The profit-taking by whales may be influenced by Ethereum's relative underperformance compared to other leading cryptocurrencies like XRP and Solana. Although not drastic, Ethereum's sluggish pace on the fast-evolving crypto landscape could be prompting these large holders to reassess their positions. Such movements are critical to monitor as they can indicate a shift in investor sentiment, which might lead to more significant market adjustments.Additionally, on-chain metrics from IntoTheBlock show a significant correlation between the price of Ethereum and the number of large transactions. This relationship highlights how influential these large transaction volumes are to the price dynamics of Ethereum. The recent decline in transaction volume, especially in April, mirrors a drop in Ethereum's price, suggesting that selling pressure from whales is having an impact.While one significant sale does not spell doom for Ethereum, it raises some concerns about the sustainability of its current movements.

Binance Executive's Trial in Nigeria Postponed Again; Legal Delays and Global Scrutiny Intensify



                    

The trial of Tigran Gambaryan, a Binance executive detained in Nigeria, has been postponed again, this time until May 17, according to a recent announcement. 



Gambaryan has been held since February over allegations involving money laundering. 




A Reuters report from May 2 stated that Binance’s legal team did not receive necessary documents to proceed with the trial, initially slated to begin on the same day. 



The delay was confirmed by the presiding judge who adjourned the case to allow sufficient time for document review.



This case, which accuses Gambaryan and Binance’s regional manager Nadeem Anjarwalla of money laundering, is distinct from another set of tax evasion charges filed against them and Binance by Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. 




All parties involved in the money laundering allegations have entered pleas of not guilty. 



Alongside the postponed trial, a bail hearing for Gambaryan has been scheduled for the same date, May 17.



The backdrop to these legal troubles involves a contentious visit by Anjarwalla and Gambaryan to Nigeria. 



Their trip was aimed at addressing accusations that Binance had manipulated Nigeria’s currency, the naira.

However, following their visit, both were detained on charges of tax evasion and money laundering. Anjarwalla managed to escape custody and has since fled to Kenya, where he also holds citizenship, in addition to the United Kingdom. 



On April 30, Interpol confirmed that extradition proceedings to return Anjarwalla were underway.



The timing of the arrests has drawn skepticism and criticism, especially as they coincided with Binance’s announcement to halt all transactions in the Nigerian naira. 



This move led to speculation about the motives behind the government’s charges. 



Binance has defended Gambaryan, asserting that he does not hold decision-making authority within the company.



Meanwhile, in the United States, a related criminal case has concluded with former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao receiving a four-month prison sentence. 



On April 30, he was found guilty of failing to implement a proper Anti-Money Laundering program.



Zhao is scheduled to serve his sentence in a correctional facility in either Oregon or Washington, with the specific date yet to be confirmed.

Source: PeckShieldWhile the reason behind the transactions is unknown, they come a day ahead of FTX debtors’ deadline to file an amended version of the Plan and Disclosure Statement, slated for May 7.The amended plan could offer FTX creditors more insights into how they will be compensated for their lost funds. The final deadline for objections is set for June 5. The collapse of FTX and its over 130 subsidiaries is known as one of the crypto industry’s most notorious black swan events, which led to users losing at least $8.9 billion worth of funds.

Despite this knowledge, S&C stood to gain financially from the FTX Group’s misconduct and so agreed, at least impliedly, to assist that unlawful conduct for its own gain.”To date, FTX creditors have sold over $490 million worth of claims through 507 transactions, according to data from crypto debt broker Claims Market.FTX Claims sold.

XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain network powering the XRP cryptocurrency, is poised to undergo significant upgrades, sparking anticipation and excitement within the cryptocurrency community.New proposals and discussions are now taking place involving Compliance, Smart Contracts, Automation (optional fees), TradFi and DeFi, Expanding features, Sidechains and better user experience (UX). With all the proposals, discussions and developments on the horizon, XRP Ledger is set to level up and reinforce its position as a leading player in the digital asset space.Krippenreiter, an XRP Ledger and DLT researcher, shares an exhaustive list of what is in the pipeline for XRP Ledger.  A few of these include DID, which allows for sharing and controlling individual digital identities on the XRPL, while the personal data that links ID is held off-chain. Its use cases include reusable KYC and a permissioned, regulated and compliant DEX. This amendment is currently being voted on, with a new bug fix set to be released in v2.2.0. The XChainBridge amendment allows for cross-chain asset transfers across distinct independent ledgers, such as a mainchain, for instance XRPL, and a sidechain, such as an EVM-Sidechain. Use cases include adding wrapped XRP as a native asset on a sidechain and EVM-Interoperability. This amendment is currently being voted on, with a new bug fix set to be released in v2.2.0. Price oracles implement a native mechanism that retrieves off-chain data from an Oracle provider for usage on the XRPL for dApps, DEX and other XRPL-based protocols. It serves as AMM version 2. This amendment is currently being voted on, with a new bug fix set to be released in v2.2.0.Several amendments are also up for discussion, such as the Managed Single Asset Tokenized Pool, Sponsored Fees and Reserves, NFToken Escrows, proposed Lending Protocol and Atomic/Batch Transactions. XRPL Plugins and Hooks are presently in the draft stage.The proposed Lending Protocol allows for native decentralized lending on the XRPL by using single-asset pool funds to offer fixed-term loans with preset conditions for interest-bearing debt. The Atomic/Batch Transactions Status allows the grouping of up to eight transactions into a single unit to allow for simple "smart-contract-like" automation.

Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Freshpet, Inc. (NASDAQ: FRPT) has recently disclosed its financial outcomes for the first quarter of 2024, showcasing a significant leap in performance metrics. The company, known for its commitment to providing fresh, real food for pets, reported a robust net sales increase of 33.6% to $223.8 million, up from $167.5 million in the comparable period last year.



This growth was primarily fueled by a 30.6% uptick in volume gains. Moreover, Freshpet witnessed a substantial improvement in profitability, with net income flipping from a loss of $24.8 million in the prior year period to a gain of $18.6 million. The gross margin also significantly rose, reaching 39.4% from 30.3% in the prior year. This increase can be attributed to improved leverage on plant expenses, reduced quality costs, and lower input costs as a percentage of sales.



FreshPet Surprises with Q1 Results, Reports $0.37 EPS Against Expected -$0.23



The adjusted EBITDA further highlighted the company’s operational efficiency, which soared to $30.6 million from just $3.0 million in the year-ago period. This remarkable improvement was due to increased adjusted gross profit despite increased SG&A expenses. Freshpet’s CEO, Billy Cyr, expressed optimism about the company’s trajectory, emphasizing the strength of the business model and the operational improvements driving margin expansion. The company focuses on delivering consistently strong performance to create significant shareholder value while fulfilling its mission to nourish pets, people, and the planet.



When comparing Freshpet’s recent performance against market expectations, it’s clear that the company has outpaced predictions. Analysts had anticipated an EPS of -$0.23 and revenue of $216.17 million for the quarter. Instead, Freshpet shattered these forecasts by posting a substantial net income of $0.37 per share and surpassing revenue expectations with $223.8 million.



This outperformance is a testament to the company’s resilient business model and its ability to generate volume-based growth amidst challenging market conditions. The improved gross margin and adjusted EBITDA underscore the company’s success in leveraging operational efficiencies and reducing costs.





FreshPet Updates Guidance for 2024, Expects Net Sales of $950 Million



Looking ahead, Freshpet has updated its guidance for 2024, reflecting the company’s confidence in its growth trajectory and operational efficiencies. The company now expects net sales of at least $950 million, marking an increase of at least 24% from 2023, which remains unchanged from previous guidance. However, the adjusted EBITDA forecast has been raised to at least $120 million, up from the prior range of $100 to $110 million, indicating a more optimistic outlook on profitability. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $210 million, consistent with prior forecasts. Freshpet’s revised guidance underscores its expectation for continued strong sales growth and operational improvements throughout the year.

Bitcoin Runes reclaims dominance over BTC transactions

Bitcoin Runes has regained its top position within the Bitcoin network by surpassing the original Bitcoin (BTC), Ordinals, and BRC-20 in terms of daily transactions.The Runes protocol launched on April 20 — coinciding with the fourth Bitcoin halving — to increase efficiency on BRC-20, an experimental standard for fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. Data from Dune Analytics shows that Runes-related transactions made up a majority of the transactions on the Bitcoin network until April 24.Runes claimed the highest transaction share, 81.3%, on April 23, pushing BTC’s transaction share down to 18.15% and Ordinals and BRC-20 transactions at 0.1% each. However, Runes transactions dwindled consistently over the next nine days until March 2. Share of transactions over the Bitcoin network by type of protocol.

There is “A Lot of Noise” in the Widespread Stablecoin Data - Visa


							

According to Cuy Sheffield, Visa has created a dashboard for accurate stablecoins analysis.



Sheffield thinks there is “a lot of noise” in the widespread stablecoins data.



Visa’s solution spots three notable trends relating to the current state and potential of stablecoins.




According to Cuy Sheffield, Head of Crypto at Visa, his company has created an Onchain Analytics Dashboard that aims to provide accurate information about the growth of stablecoins. Sheffield made the statement in a recent post on X, referencing a publication where he addressed the ongoing comparison between stablecoins and the mainstream payment settlement platforms.







The Visa Head of Crypto highlighted the famous statistics showing that stablecoins are catching up with most established settlement networks in transaction volumes. According to him, there is a lot of noise in the widespread information. Hence, his company has developed a solution for accurate measurement of the stablecoins growth data and statistics.



Sheffield noted that Visa designed the newly created dashboard to be an easily digestible, freely available window into publicly available aggregated blockchain data, beginning with stablecoins. He explained that the novel solution would eliminate the noise from the predominant stablecoin transaction models based on public blockchain networks.



The crypto expert cited instances where developers create automated bot programs that perform activities such as stablecoin arbitrage, liquidity provision, and market making. He noted that the onchain transactions resulting from interactions with these automated programs don’t resemble settlement in the traditional sense.









According to Sheffield, Visa’s new solution has discovered three notable trends relating to the current state and potential of stablecoins. First, Visa found that the supply of stablecoins is approaching an all-time high. The settlement company noted that the total demand for stablecoins has picked up in 2024, with the circulating supply approaching $150 billion.



Secondly, Visa discovered a steady growth in the monthly active stablecoins users. The platform’s dashboard showed 27.5 million active stablecoins users across all chains at the time of Sheffield’s publication.



Thirdly, Visa highlighted discrepancies between the total stablecoins transfer volume and the bot-adjusted transfer volume. By applying a simple heuristic that removes inorganic data, the platform revealed that the stablecoins transfer volume for the last 30 days can be adjusted from $2.65 trillion to $265 billion.

Bitcoin Price Crosses $65k as Whales Accumulate After Post-Halving Dip - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



In a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market, large-scale Bitcoin investors, colloquially known as “whales,” have seized the opportunity presented by the recent price retreat to acquire over 47,000 BTC, valued at approximately $2.9 billion.



This strategic accumulation marks a significant shift in sentiment, suggesting a bullish trajectory for Bitcoin despite the heightened market volatility following the highly anticipated halving event, which reduced the Bitcoin block reward to 3.125 BTC.



Whale Accumulation and Market Impact



According to Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, wallets holding at least 100 BTC have resumed accumulating cryptocurrency, gathering a substantial amount of Bitcoin at current rates. This move by the whales is expected to profoundly impact the market, potentially solidifying Bitcoin’s position and paving the way for further growth.



However, whale accumulation contrasts with the recent trend in spot Bitcoin ETFs. The eleven United States Bitcoin ETFs have recorded nearly $871 million in negative net withdrawals this week, indicating a divergence in investment strategies between institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals.





Bitcoin Price Breaks Through the $65,000 Level



On a macroeconomic level, the Federal Reserve’s dovish stance could boost Bitcoin’s upward momentum. As the central bank maintains an accommodative monetary policy, investors may increasingly turn to Bitcoin to hedge against inflation and diversify their portfolios.



Traders are advised to monitor the $60,000 mark closely, as a move below this critical level could trigger the liquidation of more than $700 million in leveraged long positions across various exchanges. This scenario could lead to increased volatility and potentially exert downward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price.



As of the most recent data, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $65,249.79, representing a 2.26% increase over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has seen a trading volume of $17,810,353,572.05 during this period and is currently being exchanged on 11,024 active markets.

This is Why Only 10% of Stablecoin Transactions Are Genuine


Visa and Allium Labs dashboard disclosed that only 10% of stablecoin transactions in April were authentic. This finding suggests that stablecoins are still far from becoming a widely accepted payment method. 
The analysis utilized a specialized dashboard that excludes transactions by bots and large traders to focus solely on genuine user activities. 
Are Only Bots and Traders Using Stablecoins?
Out of an astounding $2.2 trillion in total transactions, just $149 billion represented organic payments. Stablecoins are digital currencies anchored to stable assets like the dollar. Crypto enthusiasts believe they are potential game-changers for the $150 trillion payments industry. 
However, Visa’s recent data paints a different picture. 

Notably, fintech giants like PayPal and Stripe are delving into stablecoins, encouraged by recent technical enhancements. For instance, PayPal launched its stablecoin, PYUSD. While Stripe has begun allowing merchants to accept stablecoins for online transactions, indicating strides toward adoption.

The path for stablecoins in the payments industry is still in its early stages. Pranav Sood, the executive general manager for EMEA at Airwallex, remarked on the findings. 


“Stablecoins are still in a very nascent moment in their evolution as a payment instrument. That’s not to say that they don’t have long-term potential, because I think they do. But the short-term and the mid-term focus needs to be on making sure that existing rails work much better,” Sood said.

The stablecoin volume overestimation often results from transaction double-counting across various platforms, explained Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s head of crypto. For example, converting $100 of USDC to PYUSD on a platform like Uniswap could lead to $200 being recorded as the transaction volume.
Despite the infrastructure development and growing interest in stablecoins, consumer demand remains tepid. Many potential users find the technology complex and not user-friendly, representing a significant adoption barrier. Remarkably, checks are still used for a significant portion of business payments in the US, indicating a slow shift to newer technologies.

Meanwhile, Tether reported a record net profit of $4.52 billion for the first quarter of 2024. These financial achievements help Tether maintain the stability and reliability of USDT.
However, a significant aspect of Visa’s report is the shift in market dynamics between stablecoins. USDC has overtaken USDT in terms of transaction volume.

“It is true that USDT is the long-reigning leader of stablecoin sector, and the records profits earned by Q1 2024 do little to alter this position, but the reality is more nuanced than headlines might convey. The transaction volume do not reflect this dominance,” a Forbes report mentioned.

Jack Dorsey Departs Bluesky, Embraces "Freedom Tech" on Elon Musk's X


							

Dorsey Dumps Bluesky, Embraces Musk’s X as “Freedom Tech.”



Jack Dorsey Departs Bluesky, Shifts Focus to Open Internet Protocols.



Ex-Twitter CEO Dorsey Ditches Bluesky, Hints at Reconciliation with Musk.




Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter (now X), has abruptly stepped down from the board of Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform he championed after selling Twitter to Elon Musk. This move signals a potential shift in Dorsey’s focus and a possible thawing of relations with Musk.



Dorsey announced his departure on X itself, the platform that was once Twitter. He used this opportunity to promote his new philanthropic initiative funding open internet protocols, which he enthusiastically dubbed “freedom technology.” Interestingly, he also included X in this category, suggesting a newfound appreciation for the platform under Musk’s leadership.







This apparent change of heart is further underscored by Dorsey’s drastic reduction of his following list on X. Now, it includes only three accounts: Musk himself, Edward Snowden (whistleblower on government surveillance), and Stella Assange, wife of the imprisoned WikiLeaks founder. This curated list suggests a potential reconciliation between Dorsey and Musk, who previously clashed over the direction of Twitter.









Bluesky, envisioned as a Twitter alternative free from central control, launched to the public in February. Initially seen as a refuge from the post-Musk Twitter chaos, Bluesky has been eclipsed by Meta’s Threads, which has emerged as the more popular alternative platform.



With his departure from Bluesky’s board, Dorsey’s future plans remain unclear, but his embrace of “freedom technology” suggests a continued focus on open and decentralized online spaces.

DOGE Skyrockets After Tesla Adds Dogecoin аs Payment Method


																Tesla, the renowned electric car manufacturer led by Elon Musk, has officially integrated Dogecoin (DOGE) as a payment option on its website.
This month, DOGE has surged over 35%, with the Tesla announcement significantly fueling its rise.
Tesla Integrates DOGE Payments
Tesla has officially embraced Dogecoin, with the payment page updated to feature the OG meme coin. The addition specifies that DOGE can only be used to pay for select products, including merchandise within the online Tesla Shop.
The first response in the FAQs section instructs users to search for the Dogecoin symbol next to the “order” button for eligible products. According to the support page, individuals interested in making a purchase on the Tesla shop using Dogecoin must first own a “Dogecoin wallet.”
A disclaimer also states, “It is the responsibility of the purchaser to ensure that Dogecoin is transferred to Tesla’s Dogecoin wallet accurately.”
Following the announcement, Dogecoin surged by 21% to $0.1685, presently trading at $0.1672, marking a 4% increase in the last 24 hours, indicative of the market’s favorable response to Tesla’s adoption of the cryptocurrency for payments.




Meanwhile, analysts suggest that DOGE is on a bullish path. Various indicators related to the Dogecoin ecosystem have seen notable increases. Over the past three months, the number of non-empty DOGE wallets has surged by 13.8%.
The aggregate daily volume for transactions exceeding $100,000 has nearly reached $1.5 billion, marking a 12% rise compared to figures observed on May 1.
Daily active addresses have experienced a 20% increase, surpassing 66,000. As of May 4, Dogecoin stood out as one of the top performers with a 6% increase doubling down on its bull run.
Tesla’s History with DOGE
This isn’t the first time Elon Musk’s companies have dabbled in cryptocurrency payments. Elon Musk had previously stated that Tesla would start accepting Dogecoin as payment for some of its merchandise.
In January 2022, Tesla began accepting Dogecoin as an experiment, offering various company merchandise for DOGE, such as the Tesla Cyberwhistle and the “Giga Texas” belt buckle. Following suit, SpaceX, another Musk-led company, also embraced Dogecoin payments.
Fast forward to March 2024, during Musk’s visit to the Giga factory in Berlin, where he hinted at implementing Dogecoin payments for Tesla’s electric cars. Musk’s statement caused a 10% price surge in DOGE immediately after.

‘Nvidia of crypto’ flashes buy signal; $200 on the horizon


With Render (RNDR) returning above the psychologically important price level at $10, cryptocurrency market experts have observed that the token, popularly referred to as ‘Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) of crypto,’ has flashed buy signals that could kick it off to $200.
Specifically, after hitting a local bottom at $7, Render managed to gather bullish momentum last week that saw it advance over 27% during that period and cross the $10 level, gaining nearly 10% on the day, according to the most recent chart data obtained by Finbold on May 6.

Bullish signs for ‘Nvidia of crypto’
At the same time, Render’s recent gains have coincided with the artificial intelligence (AI) token’s growing number of crypto wallets and the relative strength index (RSI) increasing and breaking the 53 zone, a bullish sign earlier predicted by Crypto Devil in mid-April.

Meanwhile, Mister Crypto, a pseudonymous professional crypto trader with a massive following on social media platform X, has noticed Render’s bullish price action and has suggested that Render might hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $200 in this cycle, according to the X post on May 5.

AI events trigger bullishness
Notably, after sluggish price movements last month that saw Render decline a whopping 30% in a single month, the slew of upcoming AI events has triggered a bullish sentiment that has also seen other AI tokens wake up, also including the likes of Fetch.ai (FET), SingularityNET (AGIX), and others.

Indeed, these events include the Enterprise Generative AI Summit in California on May 21, the Tech & AI LIVE in London on the same day, and many more, as the revival of interest in AI technology sweeps multiple regions around the world and might usher more gains for AI assets like the ‘Nvidia of crypto.’

Spirit Airlines Posts -$1.46 EPS in Q1, in Line with Expectations - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NYSE: SAVE) has recently disclosed its financial outcomes for the first quarter of 2024. Despite facing a significant headwind due to deferred earnings recognition from Pratt & Whitney credits, the airline’s quarterly performance aligns with projections. The reported operating revenues stood at $1,265.5 million ($1.26 billion), with an operating loss of $207.3 million, translating to an operating margin of -16.4%. Adjustments for AOG (Aircraft on Ground) credits slightly improved the adjusted operating loss to $146.6 million, with a margin of -11.6%. The net loss for the quarter was reported at $142.6 million, or -$1.30 per diluted share, slightly better than the adjusted figure of -$1.46 per share.



President and CEO Ted Christie expressed optimism despite the loss, crediting the ongoing strategic and tactical changes for the unit revenue benefits. The airline focuses on implementing its standalone plan, expecting to unveil further milestones in the upcoming months. The operational challenges, including adverse weather, air traffic control delays, and civil unrest in Haiti, have notably impacted Spirit’s performance. However, the airline managed a system completion factor of 98.7 percent and a slight capacity increase of 2.1 percent year over year, demonstrating resilience amidst operational disruptions.



Spirit Airlines Posts -$1.46 Adjusted EPS for Q1, in line with Expectations



Comparing the actual performance with expectations, Spirit Airlines has shown a commendable effort in managing its financial health. The expectations for the quarter were an EPS of -$1.45 and revenue of $1.27 billion. The reported EPS of -$1.30 (-$1.46 adjusted) and revenue of $1.265.5 million indicate that Spirit has slightly outperformed the EPS expectation but matched the revenue forecast closely. This performance is noteworthy, especially considering the operational challenges and the 230 basis point headwind from deferred earnings recognition. The airline’s strategic measures, including cost-saving initiatives expected to benefit 2024 by over $75 million, are poised to improve its financial trajectory further.





Guidance



Looking ahead, Spirit Airlines has laid out a comprehensive guidance plan focusing on strategic growth and operational efficiency. The airline anticipates over $75 million in cost savings for 2024, with annualized run-rate savings estimated at over $100 million. This financial prudence is expected to strengthen Spirit’s competitive edge in the challenging airline market. Furthermore, the airline has engaged in discussions with loyalty bondholders and convertible holders due in 2025 and 2026, anticipating resolutions by summer. Spirit is optimizing its fleet to enhance operational efficiency and passenger experience by delivering seven new aircraft and the retirement of five older models. The agreement with Pratt & Whitney for AOG compensation and aircraft delivery deferrals with Airbus is a strategic move to bolster liquidity and operational readiness for future growth.

Bitcoin Whale Shifts $44M BTC After 10 Years of Dormancy - DailyCoin


        
A bitcoin whale has awakened after a decade of inactivity.



The whale made a massive transfer on Monday.



This follows other massive transfers of dormant BTC in recent months.
A Bitcoin whale that has been dormant for over a decade surprised observers on Monday after moving its entire stack of BTC, worth tens of millions of dollars.The move came amid a steady BTC rally during the weekend, which saw the largest crypto asset by market cap pull a surprise $64K comeback following a 17% plunge in April to a two-month low of $57,608. As of press time, BTC had surged 2.33% in the last 24 hours to trade at $65,205, CoinMarketCap data shows.Bitcoin Whale Awakens from 10-Year SlumberAccording to Lookonchain, a wallet that has been inactive for over 10 years transferred 687.33 BTC on May 6, worth around $43.94 million at the time of the transaction.
The X alert by Lookonchain noted that the wallet in question originally received the Bitcoin on January 12, 2014, at a time when 1 BTC was exchanging hands at $917. While the identity of the wallet’s ownership and the reason for the transfer remain unknown, it isn’t the first time dormant Bitcoins have been on the move in recent months.On March 25, blockchain analytics firm Arkham reported that the 5th richest Bitcoin address had moved almost its entire balance of 94.5K BTC ($6.05 billion), which had not been moved since the wallet received it in 2019.In January, Arkham noted that several linked addresses moved $2 billion of dormant BTC days after spot Bitcoin ETFs started trading in the U.S. The Bitcoin stack had been moved only twice before the January transfer, in 2013 and 2019.

Regulatory hurdles: South Korea blocks crypto charity donations

South Korea has decided to remove virtual currencies as a form of donation. Kyunghyang Shinmun reported on May 5 that the Ministry of Public Administration has revised the “Donations Act,” but the amendments will not allow for donation of cryptocurrency. Instead of using crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, from July, South Koreans will have to rely on other freshly approved alternatives to contribute to charities such as department store gift vouchers, stocks, and loyalty points from the internet giant Naver.This move is made despite the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies in the country. The act, as enacted in 2006, was designed for the quite different technological world, in which there were no smartphones or digital currencies. The new law broadens donation channels by introducing systems of automated response, postal and logistic services in accordance with the technological changes that led to newly created possibilities of donating.Global crypto donations reach $2 billion, South Korea excludedThe amended Donations Act in South Korea is controversial because it does not mention the digital currencies that are getting more and more popular as a means of donations throughout the world. TheGivingBlock further reports that more than $2 billion worth of donations were done globally via cryptocurrency as of January 2024. Yet, these monies will now be out of the grasp of South Korean charities under the new law.However, in the US, more than half of charities have started to accept donations in the form of digital assets indicating a more comprehensive attitude towards the integration of new financial technologies in charitable activities. This sharp contrast reveals a regulatory gap that may curtail the range of donations received by South Korean charities, especially from foreign donors who are willing to offer crypto assets.Regulatory challenges and prospectsThe modification of the Donations Act is one of the regulatory changes in relation to the cryptocurrencies in South Korea. The country has made steps to enhance control over the crypto related activities in the recent developments. For example, at the end of April, it was revealed that South Korea intends to promote the temporary crypto crime investigation unit into a permanent department to tackle the augmenting cases of crypto-related crimes and financial fraud.In addition, global crypto exchanges face challenges in penetrating the South Korea market. A Singapore exchange, Crypto.com, has faced several regulatory issues. The Korean authorities have discovered Anti-Money Laundering (AML) issues with the data provided by the exchange and have started an urgent on-site inspection.The choice of not including cryptocurrencies as a legitimate means of donation represents a cautious approach as to the regulatory implications towards digital assets since most of them are associated with criminal activities and therefore it is very difficult to monitor and control such transactions. Although the government has allowed donations to be made using local government-issued, KRW-pegged stablecoins and blockchain-issued gift vouchers, the outright bar on other popular cryptocurrencies could dampen the philanthropy landscape in South Korea.

Is China warming up to Bitcoin ETFs? BTC investor’s reply sparks curiosity

The launch of spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong on April 30 has opened new avenues for Asian traders. While the first week of trading for Hong Kong-based spot ETFs was lukewarm compared to their counterparts in the United States, Hong Kong’s proximity to China has made it a key point of discussion on whether the ETFs could be accessible to mainland China investors.Richard Byworth, managing partner at SyzCapital and BTC investor, has ignited rumors with recent comments suggesting that Bitcoin ETFs listed in Hong Kong could soon be accessible to investors from mainland China. Byworth, in his X response to Samson Mow, said that he heard talks that the spot BTC ETF could be added to Stock Connect.Stock Connect allows qualified investors from one market to access eligible shares in another market with a set quota. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, a cross-border investment route, connects the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Investors in either market can utilize their local brokers and clearing houses to trade shares in the other market. The Stock Connect program covers a wide range of stocks but is subject to a daily quota.While Byworth words are mere rumors, China’s anti-crypto stance has made it a topic of discussion on social media. Brian HoonJong Paik, a co-founder and chief operating officer at SmashFi, also addressed the rumors about mainland China investors potentially accessing the Hong Kong ETFs in the near future.  He said that 70% of Chinese wealth is in real estate and that “there are now 100 million empty homes. The CCP [Chinese Communist Party] needs an alternative asset to mitigate social unrest.”Related: Hong Kong officials recommend city’s crypto industry self-regulateIn another post, Paik listed several trade arrangements between Shanghai and Hong Kong markets that could allow Chinese investors to invest in spot BTC ETFs in Hong Kong. Apart from the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor scheme allows qualified Chinese institutional investors (such as banks, funds and insurance companies) to invest in overseas markets, including Hong Kong. Another trade agreement — the mutual recognition of funds — between Hong Kong and mainland China allows eligible mainland and Hong Kong funds to be distributed in each other’s markets.China banned Bitcoin mining and foreign crypto exchanges from offering their services to mainland customers in 2021. However, despite a blanket ban on crypto-related businesses and services, Chinese courts have deemed BTC legal property in several jurisdictions.Web3 Gamer: Web3 gaming won’t exist in 5 years, $656K for best crypto game pitch

Trading of ZERO, the token of ZeroLend, has started

Today, Monday, May 6, 2024, the trading of the ZERO token by ZeroLend has been launched. 

Exchange pairs have been launched on eight centralized exchanges and one DEX: OKX, Bybit, KuCoin, Bitget, MEXC, HTX, Gate.io, and Poloniex, plus the decentralized exchange Lynex. 

ZERO, the token of ZeroLend
ZeroLend is a DeFi lending protocol on Linea, zkSync, Blast, and Manta.
Linea a sua volta è una blockchain su cui il liquidity layer nativo è proprio il DEX Lynex.
ZERO is the governance token of ZeroLend.
The peculiarity of ZeroLend is to be a DeFi lending market on layer-2, and in fact Linea is a layer-2 on Ethereum.
Linea is a blockchain launched just last year, and in the meantime has already raised over 270 million dollars in TVL. 
By combining the four layer-2s on which ZeroLend is present, the protocol has already surpassed $200 million in TVL, making it one of the main protocols for TVL on both Linea and Manta.
The ZERO token of ZeroLend, however, should not be confused with other tokens that have the same ticker, ZERO, even if they have different names. 
Using OKX exchanges as a reference, where ZERO is recording the highest volumes, its opening price this morning was 0.25 cents of a dollar, but already in the first minute of trading, due to high volatility, it rose to a maximum of 1.3 cents. 
Excluding these strong initial fluctuations, the price is doing nothing but oscillating around 0.75 cents of a dollar, with fluctuations up to 1.0 cents and below 0.6 cents.
This is a launch characterized by overall good trading volumes, and relatively low volatility, excluding the first few minutes of trading.
The characteristics
The feature of the ZERO token highlighted on the official ZeroLend website is staking. 
Staking ZERO tokens means receiving, in addition to the classic staking rewards, also voting rights and potential future incentives for other protocols.
Always on the official ZeroLend website you can also find the page where you can request the claim of these tokens.
In fact, owners of earlyZERO and Zero Gravity Points can request their share of ZERO tokens by connecting their wallet to this page. 
ZeroLend: The ZERO token TGE
The token generation event (TGE) of ZERO actually took place last month. 
With this token generation event, the tokens were physically created on the various blockchains, but the distribution occurred at a later time. 
Now earlyZERO and Zero Gravity Points holders can claim to receive the new tokens on their wallets. 
Note that 35% of the tokens were distributed during the Private Sale, but 53% will be distributed to the community in four steps: airdrop (18%), liquidity (10%), emissions (20%), and treasury (5%). The rest will go to advisors (7%) and the team (5%). 
In order to make ZERO’s tokenomics sustainable in the long term, the majority of token distribution will end within a year of the token launch. Therefore, most tokens will be distributed by April 2025. 
Subsequently, emissions will be reduced by half every 12 months.
Overall, 78% of the total supply will be distributed within the 12 months following the TGE, while the remaining 22% will be released in the following years. 
The total supply is 100 billion ZERO tokens, of which only a quarter (25 billion) have been put into circulation so far. 
DeFi lending
Since exchanges play an important role within the decentralized finance sector, and leverage trading is also done on DEXs, lending is a crucial service for the success of DeFi.
For example, the third largest DeFi protocol by TVL is actually a lending protocol, with two lending protocols in the top five in this particular ranking. 
ZeroLend is already among the top 15 lending protocols with the highest TVL in the DeFi sector, although from this point of view it is far from the top seven, which each have over a billion dollars in TVL. 
However, this is a protocol that was born only last year, and specifically dedicated to layer-2, while for example the world’s largest one (Aave, with over 10 billion dollars of TVL) has been around for four years, and operates on as many as 12 different chains including the main layer-1 ones.
However, it is worth noting that ZeroLend is the only DeFi lending protocol among the top fifteen, in addition to Aave and Compound, to be active on at least 6 chains. 
The fact is that with the increasing use of layer-2, especially those on Ethereum, it would be useful for DeFi protocols to be active on multiple chains, and in particular on both layer-1 and layer-2.
From this point of view, ZeroLend seems to be superior to other similar projects, even though it is focused only on layer-2.

It's since retraced slightly, but is still 0.5% higher than it was this time yesterday.And what's been good for Bitcoin has been great for the rest of the crypto market. Early Monday morning the global cryptocurrency market capitalization is sitting at $2.5 trillion after having gained 1.3% in the past day, according to CoinGecko data.At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price has backtracked to $64,264.08, which is still 3% higher than it was this time last week. In the past day, $13 billion worth of BTC has been traded. Roughly 22% of that volume was traded on Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume. On Binance, it's the First Digital USD (FDUSD) stablecoin that's been the most popular trading pair for BTC investors, according to CoinGecko data. FDUSD, launched by Hong Kong based company First Digital Labs in 2023, has accounted for $3 billion worth of volume in the past day. The world's oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization also just celebrated a birthday of sorts. The Bitcoin network has now processed more than 1 billion transactions.Bitcoin daily transactions spiked to an all-time high this time last year, when the BRC-20 standard and ordinals soared in popularity—but not without creating a bit of controversy. A vocal group of developers at the time said that BRC-20 tokens and ordinals should be blocked on the network.But now a newcomer, Runes, has become the main driver behind growing daily transactions. Just yesterday, the Bitcoin network saw 304,306 Runes transactions, 193,439 "good old BTC" transactions, and about 4,000 of Ordinals and BRC-20 transactions combined, according to a Dune dashboard. That means Runes made up roughly 60% of all transactions on the network yesterday.Runes is a protocol built on top of Bitcoin. It's been described as a project that picks up where BRC-20 tokens, which effectively introduced NFT-like assets to the network. Runes is an attempt to make the process of creating fungible tokens on Bitcoin more efficient and has ushered in a new era of shitcoins for the crypto OG.There have been a few other noteworthy Bitcoin developments over the weekend.For starters, a 13-year-old wallet that's held 687 Bitcoin since it was trading for $2 has just moved their stash. It was highlighted by Bitgrow founder Vivek Sen on Twitter earlier this morning.It's hard to say why an anonymous whale wallet that was created more than a decade ago moved its funds, but traders tend to take it as a heartening sign when someone who could have sold at any time held onto their BTC for so long."The owner of the wallet hodled all the way from $2 to 65,000," Sen wrote.

Is Bitcoin a good investment? Top 4 factors to consider - AMBCrypto



Holders of Bitcoin might accumulate more, prompting suggestions of a price increase.
A crucial indicator revealed that BTC might plunge again before it hits another all-time high.

Investing in crypto can be risky. But one thing that Bitcoin [BTC], the cryptocurrency with the largest market cap, has shown, is that choosing the coin can yield rewards that only a few assets can dream of.
But don’t take AMBCrypto’s word as advice.
Instead, a quick look at BTC’s all-time performance revealed that this is no fluke. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s price has increased by a mind-blogging 103,942,579% since its inception.
However, one thing investors can assure you is that it is not just glitz and glamour on Bitcoin’s end.
For instance, the market crash of 2022 was proof that “up only” is only a myth, as any Bitcoin investment can go down once the market hits a bear phase.
Watch out! The direction is not always north
In 2021, Bitcoin hit an All-Time high (ATH) of $69,000. But a year back, triggered by certain events, the coin dropped below $16,000, confirming that the asset’s volatility could have an unpleasant impact on investors.
Fast-forward to 2024, the coin surpassed its all-time high, reaching $73,750 on the 14th of March. Despite the hike, the coin retraced. As of this writing, it changed hands at $64,298.
This value represented a 5.58% decrease in the last 30 days. But is Bitcoin a good investment for you? Well, certain factors influence the price of the coin.
For instance, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year influenced the rally to its new all-time high. However, the amazing inflows of the first quarter are nowhere to be found.
As such, investors are left with the fundamentals and key indicators to depend on. For starters, AMBCrypto looked at Bitcoin’s potential to give good returns using on-chain metrics.
More gains may be coming
One of the metrics we looked at was the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The MVRV ratio shows the profitability of BTC holders.
At press time, the 30-day MVRV ratio was 1.1.9%. This means that if holders of Bitcoin sell their assets, the average return would be around this percentage.
Source: Santiment
But this is unlikely to happen, as the unrealized gains do not seem enticing enough to trigger a widespread sell-off. Therefore, the reasonable action would be for investors to hold to their coins.
Also, when the MVRV ratio was 21.30%, Bitcoin’s price was over $71,000. With this data, more accumulation could take place, and this could lead BTC back to a more profitable region.
Will Bitcoin add an extra 40% increase?
Furthermore, there have been predictions that the coin might hit $100,000 this cycle. While some argue in favor of the forecast, others prefer to be on the conservative side.
For the bullish ones, the ETF and ATH before halving was evidence that Bitcoin might add another 40% to its price before it hit the top.
AMBCrypto spoke to Ben Cousens about the matter. Cousens is the Chief Strategy Officer at ZBD, a company using the Bitcoin lightning network to power payments.
While the ZBD chief did not give a specific price prediction, he displayed optimism in his comment, saying that,
“Within the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, historically, the halving has coincided with rising fiat prices due to the supply shock. his halving came at a time when ETFs were increasing institutional adoption, playing a bigger role with more of an impact. The additional excitement about the halving leads to a new cohort of users who learn how to use Bitcoin.”
Going by Cousens’s opinion, a new wave of new investors might come for Bitcoin. Should this be the case, rising demand could lead to higher prices, and most investments might be worth it.
A short-term outlook may not cut it
However, short-term investors might need to be wary. As much as BTC can be a good investment, the price might also undergo a correction.
One of the reasons for this is the Network Value to Transaction (NVT) ratio. This metric looks at a coin’s market cap relative to its total trading volume.
If the NVT ratio increases, it means that the coin could be overvalued in the short term. However, a low NVT ratio suggests an undervaluation of the current asset value.
At the time of writing, IntoTheBlock data showed that Bitcoin’s NVT ratio had risen to 98.79, implying that a return below $64,000 could be imminent.
Source: Santiment
Should this be the case, the price of Bitcoin might collapse to $59,000 again. But in the long run, Bitcoin can be a good investment depending on the purchase price.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

For this cycle, the price of the coin is expected to hit between $87,000 and $92,000. Therefore, buying at press time price or waiting for another decline might be a good move.
Either way, investors should be on the lookout for happenings in the ecosystem, as an unfavorable event might invalidate this thesis.

US Air Force Accelerates Development of AI-Controlled Fighter Jets

In a major step toward integrating artificial intelligence into military activities, the US Air Force recently completed the first official test flight of a fighter aircraft controlled by an AI system. The dazzling demonstration, which was open only to a select few media members, demonstrated the Air Force’s commitment to being at the forefront of employing AI-enabled systems within aerial defense.AI outperforms human pilotsBut even so early, with only around two dozen real flights under its belt since September 2023, the AI proved to be a quick study. It already outmatched some of experienced human fighter pilots, said Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall, who rode shotgun on the test flight fully aware it was the AI-controlled aircraft that was outclassing any human pilot.It was a one-hour test built around a hypothetical combat situation in which an AI-controlled fighter squared off against an F-16 with a human pilot. Both aircraft made maneuvers to gain an advantage, but the AI showed its supremacy in outmaneuvering the human pilot.With this advanced learning technique, the AI in the Air Force’s system can start learning basic maneuvers in the sim by using a combination of simulation and real operational flying to test out different strategies and methods. Then, data from actual flight tests is integrated into the simulator to enable the AI to constantly improve its skills in an iterative learning cycle.AI-controlled aircraft, Source: DALL-E 3 through notebookcheckUS Air Force embracing cost-effective solutionsSuppose the US does indeed have the field to itself for AI-controlled military aircraft in current real operations. In that case, plans for the first unnamed AI aircraft are not expected to launch until 2028, with a target of 1,000 ready for deployment. China is actively expected to develop similarly.Kendall defended such overambitious intentions on the grounds that the exclusion of AI technology is hazardous to security. However, humanitarian organizations, including the Red Cross, have raised concerns that AI systems might act independently regarding decisions regarding the employment of weapons.Kendall further allayed the fears by claiming that human operators would always watch and monitor the AI system whenever a weapon was deployed. Yet beyond the tech benefits, the Air Force is also moving toward the use of AI-controlled aircraft as another step toward a budget-minded approach. Now facing looming budgetary concerns due to the recent large expenditures, the Air Force wishes to produce smaller and less expensive aircraft by not having to account for human pilots in the production model. In a world rushing to unleash AI in the military domain, the US Air Force, by taking a bold stride, furthered its commitment to holding a strategic advantage by exploring cost-effective, cutting-edge solutions for national security.

Pepe's 26% Weekly Gains Draw The 'Most Beautiful Weekly Chart' But Now's Not The Time To Buy, Says Trader - Benzinga

Pepe PEPE/USD has been chasing the meme coin leaders in weekly gains, but one heavily followed meme coin trader forecasts a flat performance for the coin in the coming months.What Happened: Despite describing Pepe’s current weekly chart as “most beautiful,” intuitio cautions investors to be careful when adding to their long positions, as Pepe sits “right under weekly resistance and round number.”In another development, data from Lookonchain reveals that a smart money investor spent 1.26 million USDC to purchase 142.96 billion PEPE at a price of $0.000008831. This investor has traded Pepe seven times in the past six months, with an impressive win rate of 85.7% and a total profit of $915,000.Also Read: Dogecoin Is ‘Primed For Higher’ But Pepe Is ‘On A Moon Mission,’ Exclaims TraderWhy It Matters: IntoTheBlock data highlights a growth of 2.2% in Pepe’s hodlers balance, reflecting positive sentiment surrounding the meme coin. With current weekly gains of around 30%, approximately 86% of Pepe holders are currently at profit, while only 1% remain out of profit, and around 13% stand at breakeven. However, Pepe’s price correlation with Bitcoin stands at a low 0.09, compared to the high correlation of the two meme coin leaders, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.Price Action: At the time of writing, PEPE is trading at $0.000008806, up 3.6% over the past 24 hours and 26.4% over the past seven days.What’s Next: The influence of meme coins and Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: ‘I’ll Buy Ethereum, Dogecoin, And Maybe Pepe…When I Think Bitcoin Has Bottomed,’ Says This Prominent Crypto Analyst

Bitcoin Hits New Milestone, Processes One Billion Transactions


																The Bitcoin network has achieved a new milestone: one billion processed transactions, 15 years, four months, and four days after its genesis block was mined.
According to data on Clark Moody’s Bitcoin dashboard, the one billionth transaction was mined into block 842,241 on May 5 at 9:34 pm UTC.
Bitcoin Process One Billion Transactions
Bitcoin’s latest milestone comes less than three weeks after the network completed its fourth halving, which cut miners’ block rewards from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125 BTC. The halving occurred on April 19, when Bitcoin’s total transaction count hovered around 990.64 million.
The network has witnessed a significant rise in daily transactions in the past month, with the launch of new protocols like Ordinals, Runes, and the BRC-20 token standard.
The launch of Ordinals brought about Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that drove user activity on the network. At the time of writing, data from the market analysis platform Dune showed that roughly $432 million had been spent as transaction fees on over 66.4 million inscriptions, indicating that market participants have been busy on the Bitcoin network.
On the other hand, Runes was launched on Bitcoin’s halving day, particularly on the halving block. The protocol expands Bitcoin’s functionality by allowing the creation of fungible tokens, as Ethereum does. During the halving weekend, Runes transactions accounted for more than 50% of the total Bitcoin transactions, surpassing Ordinals and dominating the network.
In addition, the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the United States and Hong Kong has also contributed to the spike in Bitcoin transactions. The Bitcoin ETF market currently has a market cap of $53.41 billion and assets under management totaling $52.68 billion.
Not the First
While it took Bitcoin around 15 years to process one billion transactions, the network’s count is likely to hit two billion in a shorter time frame as BTC gains more adoption and users flock to the blockchain.
It is worth noting that Bitcoin is not the first blockchain to hit 1,000,000,000 transactions. Ethereum did so a few years ago and has processed over 2.4 billion transactions since its launch in 2015.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s one billion transaction count does not include those executed on the network’s layer-2 protocol Lightning Network, launched in 2018.

The rebound might not be a momentary blip but could be indicative of a more sustained rally. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's rebound serves as a barometer for the broader cryptocurrency market, with its price movements often influencing sentiment and trading activity across the entire ecosystem. As the original cryptocurrency and a bellwether for market trends, BTC's recovery bodes well for investor confidence and overall market sentiment.Thus, the Shiba Inu team member's call to pay attention might not just be about observing the numbers; it might be about understanding the forces that influence the dynamics of the market and being ready to act when the time is right.

Bitfinex CTO dismisses rumors of major database breach, suggests misinformation by hackers

Bitfinex Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino has debunked rumors that the crypto exchange suffered a database exploit recently.Over the weekend, several reports suggested a potential database leak comprising 22,500 records of emails and passwords allegedly from Bitfinex users.However, Ardoino opined that the purported breach was likely fake, stating that only a small percentage of the leaked information matched the exchange users, adding that the firm does not “store plaintext passwords, nor 2FA secrets in clear text.”Moreover, Ardoino questioned the legitimacy of the hackers’ claims, noting their failure to contact the exchange directly. According to him, the hacker group announced the breach on April 25, but Bitfinex only became aware of the incident a day before the deadline.Ardoino added:“Different security researchers rushed to hype the breach. Yet from what we could gather, the hackers collected a database of emails/passwords likely from different crypto breaches. Most of users unfortunately use same email/passwords across multiple sites.”Nonetheless, the CTO promised to “keep reviewing information to ensure no stone remains unturned.”Meanwhile, Alice from Shinoji Research, one of the accounts that propagated the Bitfinext database leak claim, has retracted the statement. They wrote:“Removed the original BFX hack post as I’m not able to edit it. What appears to have happened is this ‘Flocker’ group curated a list of BitFinex logins from other breaches. They then made the site look like a ransom demand for a major breach.”Alice further noted that the hackers exploited the rumor to generate hype around their activities and attract potential investors for future hacks.“Instead it seems the plan is to hype up their operation so that people can ‘invest’ in future hacks. They are probably not related to the real FLocker group from a few years ago,” Alice added.Mentioned in this article

Analyst Predicts Rallies for Altcoin Market, Says Top Memecoin Has Fully Confirmed New Macro Uptrend - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst says it’s time for altcoins to rally and predicts that one blue-chip memecoin will be a major beneficiary.
Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 461,000 followers on the social media platform X that the OTHERS chart, which tracks the market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding the 10 largest digital assets, is potentially gearing up for a bounce off the $250 billion level.










Based on his chart, the analyst appears to be initially targeting the $315 billion level before an eventual run to the old highs near $425 billion.
“Altcoin Market Cap is still holding the $250 billion well as support, positioning itself for a future move to the upside via the black pathway.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
Looking at specific altcoins, Rekt Capital says that Dogecoin (DOGE) has officially confirmed its macro uptrend after a healthy retest of the $0.12 level. The analyst’s chart suggests that the next major resistance levels sit at $0.20 and $0.278.
“Dogecoin has made a +30% recovery after successfully retesting the confluent area of support that is the blue Macro Downtrend and the black Range Low (orange circle area).
The Macro Downtrend is over.
But this has fully confirmed the new Macro Uptrend.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
At time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.163.
As for Bitcoin (BTC), Rekt says the crypto king has potentially already found strong support around the $60,000 level.
“Looks like it was just a downside wick
Weekly Close just like this would confirm this pool of liquidity as secured support.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $64,265.

Ethereum Sees Record-Breaking Month for Stablecoin Volume, Led by DAI


							

Ethereum witnessed a record-breaking month for stablecoin volume in April.



Stablecoin DAI accounted for the majority of the on-chain volume.



One notable transaction involving DAI added almost $1 billion in volume alone.




Ethereum, the world’s leading smart contract blockchain network, witnessed a surge in stablecoin volume in April, reaching unprecedented levels, according to recent data. This surge, however, also includes flash loan activity, which significantly boosted the figures.



The total monthly stablecoin volume on Ethereum has been steadily rising for the past three months, marking a departure from months of relatively flat activity. The surge in April was particularly noteworthy, breaking previous records.



As per TheBlock’s data, stablecoin DAI, played a significant role in driving this surge, recording a volume of $636 billion in April alone. DAI’s volume accounted for the majority of the total on-chain volume for Ethereum stablecoins, which amounted to nearly $1.2 trillion for the month.



This surge in DAI volume can be attributed to its increasing use in complex Miner Extractable Value (MEV) transactions, often involving flash loans. MEV transactions are complex transactions that exploit the order in which transactions are processed on Ethereum to extract value, and DAI has become a popular choice for such transactions.









One notable transaction involving DAI added almost one billion dollars of volume alone. This increased activity contributed to DAI’s supply growth, which added around one billion dollars worth of tokens since March 7, reaching a total current supply of 5.44 billion.



While other stablecoins also saw an increase in volume, DAI managed to slightly increase its share of the total stablecoin supply over the same period.



May is shaping up to be another significant month for DAI, with its supply already increasing by $220 million since the beginning of the month, according to MakerBurn. However, DAI could face challenges from competitors like Ethena’s USDe and Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin, which may impact its supply in the future.

Ripple Case 'Inevitably' Goes To Second Circuit: Ex-SEC Expert


								At the recent MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin For Corporations event, Neel Maitra, a partner at Dechert and a seasoned former fintech and crypto specialist at the SEC, offered a deep dive into the judicial complexities currently entangling crypto regulations, with a special focus on the ongoing Ripple litigation. His insights are particularly noteworthy given his extensive background in both regulatory bodies and private legal practice, including his time at Sullivan & Cromwell.
Will Ripple Vs. SEC ‘Inevitably’ Go To The Second Circuit?
During the Legal & Regulatory Panel, Maitra discussed the divergent judicial opinions on how secondary trading of cryptocurrencies like XRP should be legally classified. He emphasized that this disparity in judicial opinion, especially within the Southern District of New York, illustrates the uncertainty and complexity of current crypto regulations. “It’s funny because three of the judges relevant here were in the Southern District of New York. So in a single federal district the judges can’t agree on how these secondary trading of crypto should be treated,” Maitra observed.

The primary issue at hand, as explained by Maitra, revolves around whether transactions conducted on cryptocurrency exchanges constitute securities transactions under US law. Judge Analisa Torres, overseeing the Ripple case, differentiated between primary and secondary transactions. In primary transactions, purchasers buy directly from Ripple and rely on Ripple’s efforts for potential profits, clearly categorizing such transactions as securities under the Howey Test.
However, Judge Torres argued that secondary transactions, which occur anonymously on exchanges, do not automatically qualify as securities transactions. She termed these as “blind transactions,” where the buyers are often unsophisticated investors unaware of whom they are buying from or the intricacies of the underlying business operations of Ripple.
In contrast, Judge Jed Rakoff and Judge Katherine Polk Failla in separate cases (Terra Luna and Coinbase, respectively) adopted a broader view. They posited that the aggressive marketing strategies employed by crypto companies could influence both primary and secondary market transactions, thereby potentially categorizing even secondary transactions as securities.

“The differing opinions among these judges underscore the nuances and the evolving nature of cryptocurrency regulation,” Maitra explained. He predicted, “It’s inevitable that this [the Ripple vs SEC case] is going to the second circuit and maybe even further, who knows, but there’s a lot left to go in this particular decision just like with Coinbase.” His remark highlights the ongoing debate and the likely progression of the case through the higher judicial echelons.
Maitra also shed light on the SEC’s interpretation of the outcomes of these cases. Despite the setbacks in some rulings, the SEC does not view these as a repudiation of its overall stance on cryptocurrencies as securities. “The SEC doesn’t necessarily see the Ripple case as being a failure of its theory that secondary trading of crypto is securities trading. They just see it as maybe we couldn’t put forward the evidence sufficiently well to convince the court and we’ll fix that at the second circuit level,” he stated.


This perspective suggests that the SEC is preparing to refine its arguments and evidence in anticipation of further judicial reviews. This ongoing litigation not only affects Ripple and other individual firms but also sets critical precedents that could shape the regulatory landscape for the entire cryptocurrency market in the United States.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.54259.

Crypto.com Surpasses 100M Users Globally, Doubling since Formula 1 Partnership | Coinspeaker



As Crypto.com aims for its ne­xt 100 million users, ongoing innovation and teamwork will be ke­y.

Crypto.com, a prominent cryptocurre­ncy exchange, has reache­d a crucial milestone – over 100 million use­rs worldwide. This accomplishment follows the platform’s use­r surge after sponsoring the Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix in May 2022.
The­ company credits this growth to a multifaceted strate­gy. Impactful marketing campaigns like “Fortune Favors the­ Brave” and the motivational film “INEVITABLE” were­ instrumental in raising Crypto.com’s public profile. Furthermore­, high-profile partnerships with sports league­s such as the NBA and NHL substantially improved brand awarene­ss.




“Positioning our brand through engaging campaigns and iconic partnerships has made Crypto.com a household name,” said Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com. “But I’m most proud of the fact that we’ve surpassed the 100 million user milestone while building the most widely regulated platform in the industry by leading in global licenses and registrations.”
Crypto.com’s Push for Mainstream Adoption
One of Crypto.com’s key strategies for building user trust is through robust security protocols and transpare­nt communication. Crypto.com emphasizes its compliance commitme­nt, highlighting its industry-leading global registration and lice­nsing practices. This regulatory focus resonate­s with users seeking a se­cure platform for their crypto investme­nts.
Additionally, Crypto.com can bridge the divide be­tween crypto and daily life by e­nabling real-world applications. Integrating crypto payments at Ade­laide Oval exemplifie­s the potential for increase­d mainstream adoption.
Crypto.com’s partnership with Adelaide Oval and DataMesh brings conve­nience to sports fans and concert-goe­rs by allowing cryptocurrency payments, offering a smooth, se­cure way to use digital currencie­s. Promotions and cashback will encourage further adoption during major eve­nts, boosting fan engagement.

As Crypto.com aims for its ne­xt 100 million users, ongoing innovation and teamwork will be ke­y. The firm can explore ne­w products made for specific markets, as sugge­sted by Karl Mohan, Crypto.com’s APAC head based in Me­lbourne, for the Australian market.
“The Australian market has been pivotal to our success so far and we look forward to expanding our presence here by offering our industry-leading products to the increasingly mature investor base,” said Mohan. “We look forward to earning our next 100 million users by continuing to provide customers in Australia, and globally, a secure and compliant platform.”
Vital partne­rships will also be crucial. Crypto.com’s current deals with major sports groups like­ the AFL and AFLW have clearly booste­d brand awareness. Raising similar deals across varie­d fields can further drive use­r growth.
Crypto.com’s 100 million users mark a big step. But the re­al test is turning this growth into long-term success. By focusing on se­curity, building trust, and embracing innovation, Crypto.com can place itself as a vital part of the­ ever-changing crypto world.

                        The Dogecoin price has bounced back faster than any other top ten crypto coin in the last seven days. The world’s favorite meme coin added 18.8% over the last week and currently trades at $0.1676. Dogecoin’s rally comes following an announcement that made the rounds on X that Tesla is now accepting DOGE as payment for merch from the EV company’s online store. However, whereas back in 2021, news like this could very easily pump the price, this week’s rally appears to be driven by broader market movements.By contrast, neither of the two leading cryptocurrencies came anywhere near to that level of appreciation this week. The original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ($BTC), grew 4.5% to $65,185, while its number one contender, Ethereum ($ETH), added 1% to trade at $3,203 as of this writing. What’s up with the Dogecoin Price and the Meme Coins Market?
Meme coins are posting some of the largest seven-day price rallies in the market right now. While Dogecoin’s rally stands out like a sore thumb among the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, it’s one of the weaker performing assets among the five largest meme coins.Crypto’s fifth largest meme coin, Floki ($FLOKI), a $2 billion market cap token made by fans of Elon Musk’s eponymous pet Shiba Inu, grew 19% since last Monday to hit $0.0001973 as of this writing. DogWifHat ($WIF) and Pepe Coin ($PEPE)—the fourth and third largest meme coins both with market caps just above $3.5 billion—ballooned 30% or more over the last seven days and now trade at $3.62 and $0.059055 respectively. Over on Dogecoin’s trading chart for the last seven months, we see brief heights of over $0.22 towards the end of March and on April Fool’s Day. The token has been fairly volatile this year, but has strong psychological support at $0.12 cents. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 49 and falling, Dogecoin is likely to stabilize, but could begin taking losses if the market moves adversely.Source: TradingViewSealana $SEAL the Next Viral Meme Coin?
The above meme coins are stalwarts of the scene, but investors chasing the rocket-ride upside potential of the sector would be potentially better off diversifying their holdings with tokens that are still in presale.Solana’s Sealana ($SEAL) the all-American redneck seal has already raised a quarter of a million dollars in a hilarious new presale that’s barely only a few days old. Sealana is a spin on the viral South Park character Gamer Guy, aka Fat Computer Nerd.

Shares Dip as BioNTech (BNTX) Reports Net Loss of €315.1 M in Q1 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



BioNTech SE (BNTX) has recently disclosed its financial outcomes for the first quarter of 2024, providing a comprehensive overview of its current performance and future outlook. The quarter has been marked by significant advancements in the company’s pipeline, including the initiation of potentially registrational trials and the presentation of crucial clinical data. Despite these developments, BioNTech has reported first-quarter revenues of €187.6 million and a net loss of €315.1 million, with a loss per share of €1.31. This performance reflects the company’s ongoing investments in research and development, particularly in its innovative cancer vaccine candidates and COVID-19 vaccine adaptations.



The company’s progress toward launching ten or more potentially registrational trials by the end of 2024 is noteworthy. The commencement of a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating BNT323/DB-1303 in metastatic breast cancer patients and the planned start of another Phase 3 trial in recurrent endometrial cancer highlight BioNTech’s commitment to expanding its oncology portfolio.



Additionally, the presentation of clinical data at major scientific meetings underscores the potential of its mRNA-based cancer vaccine platforms. These efforts and the continued development of a variant-adapted COVID-19 vaccine demonstrate BioNTech’s strategic focus on addressing unmet medical needs through innovation.



BioNTech Falls Short of EPS and Revenue Forecasts in Q1



Comparing BioNTech’s first-quarter performance against expectations reveals a mixed picture. Analysts had anticipated a loss per share of -€0.80 and revenue forecasts of €519.29 million for the quarter. The actual results, with a loss per share of €1.31 and revenues of €187.6 million, fell short of these expectations. This discrepancy underscores the challenges faced by the company, including the high costs associated with advancing its clinical programs and the unpredictable nature of drug development and commercialization. Despite these hurdles, BioNTech’s commitment to its research and development pipeline remains unwavering, as evidenced by its significant investments in potential breakthrough therapies.





BioNTech Optimistic on its Development Pipeline



Looking ahead, BioNTech has provided guidance that reflects its optimistic outlook on its development pipeline and commercial strategies. The company’s focus on advancing its registrational trials and preparing for the commercial launch of its variant-adapted COVID-19 vaccine in 2024 indicates a strategic approach to growth and market expansion. Moreover, BioNTech’s plans to share additional clinical data at upcoming scientific meetings suggest that the company is poised to reveal further insights into the efficacy and safety of its product candidates. This forward-looking perspective highlights BioNTech’s confidence in its ability to overcome current challenges and achieve long-term success.

BNB Auto-Burn: Mechanisms and Impacts Explored

The BNB token has an auto-burn system that reduces the token supply to an acceptable range. BNB auto-burn employs two coin-burning mechanisms. The first involves burning a portion of the BNB spent as gas fees on the BNB Chain. The second consists of BNB burning events held quarterly. 
The percentage to be burnt will be calculated as the total number of BNB created in the period. The BNB auto-burn mechanism calculates the burn amount with the then-prevailing BNB price and the blocks created on the BNB Chain in a particular quarter. This mechanism enhances the transparency as well as predictability for the BNB community. 
A supply of the BNB token is governed by a BNB auto-burn system, which is based on various coin-burning mechanisms. The BNB Auto-Burn mechanism calculates burn amounts using prevailing prices and blockchain data. BNB burns will occur through BEP-95, aiming to remove up to 100 million BNB from the market through real-time and quarterly auto-burn events, adjusting supply and demand dynamics. 
What is a Coin Burn?
In cryptocurrency projects, coin burns refer to the destruction of currencies to limit their supply and increase the value of remaining coins. They’re usually done quarterly or semi-annually and transfer the coins to a wallet requiring an unknown key, making them permanently unspendable. Binance plans to burn 100 million BNB coins every three months until the supply gets exhausted.
Even though there are various ways of burning crypto coins, some projects fully integrate a self-destruction mechanism into their protocol. BNB had a burning smart contract feature for this coin that was hard-coded from its inception.

Burning Crypto Simplified: Here Are The Top Factors You Need To Know

Coin burns have now become more prevalent due to DeFi protocols. This coin burn followed Ethereum’s incorporation during the London hard fork in 2021, a mechanism of burning coins for its ETH base fee. It is a pre-condition before receiving coins to an address without private keys and does not have transaction capabilities.
The Role of BNB in the Blockchain Ecosystem
The Binance Coin BNB is another cryptocurrency falling within the category of native currency of the Binance ecosystem. As an ERC-20 token in the Ethereum blockchain, the BNB was initially launched in 2017, the total supply of which equaled 200 million. In 2019, Binance started swapping its mainnet as most tokens were transferred to BNB Chain, remaining in the old network.

Web2 has been beneficial through most of our life, but web3 plays a significant role in the development of the future of internet.

How is BNB Burned?
BNB is the utility token for the BNB ecosystem, and they have been 200,000,000 from inception. However, this number has been gradually reducing through the constant burning of coins. The reduction in supply will keep reducing until half of the initial amount or less than 100,000,000 BNB.

There are two distinct methodologies through which BNB can be burnt – first, the quarterly BNB burning event, and second, with the advent of BEP-95, some percentage of the BNB used as gas fees on the BNB Chain can become burnt.
BEP-95
BEP-95 is a BNB burning mechanism in real-time. Since the 2021 upgrade of the BNB Smart Chain, it has been observed that BEP-95 burns around 860 BNB daily, whereas some of the gas fees provided on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) are burned.
Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao introduced BEP-95 to speed up BNB burn, especially when it went slower than planned. BEP-95 ensures a continuous supply of BNB by burning some gas fees collected on all validators of each block. BEP-95, being closely related to the BSC network, will continue to move towards burning BNB even after getting the indicative burn target of 100 million for a while.
Quarterly Auto-Burn
The other strategy is the routine Binance quarterly burns, where a certain number of the BNB coins are removed from circulation via repurchasing. The first burn occurred in October 2017, with the burning of 986,000 BNBs.

Binance Launchpool: Empowering Users for Successful Crypto Investment

The pre-announced scheduled burns are conducted with the use of Binance revenues. Various variables such as total profitability, amount of the BNB contained in the circulation, and number of blocks generated over each quarter dictate the quantity of Binance coins burnt.
What Is BNB Auto-Burn?
When the price of BNB changes and supply/demand dynamics change, BNB Auto-Burn changes the burn quantity. A lower price of BNB causes a burn of more BNB. The system ensures transparency in processing payments, improving objectivity. Unlike the Quarterly burn, it runs independently on the Binance blockchain using on-chain data and BNB trading volume.
BEP-95 continues burning BNB using a calculation based on on-chain statistics, such as total blocks generated and the average price of BNB, if the total circulating supply of BNB drops below 100 million.

B stands for the BNB to burn. N is the total number of blocks produced during the quarter. P is the average price of BNB, and K is a constant price anchor first set at 1000.
What is the BNB Pioneer Burn Program?
In 2020, Binance introduced the BNB Pioneer Burn Program to assist users who unintentionally lost their BNB funds. Under this program, users who meet certain criteria can claim their lost BNB and get an auto-burned amount.  And here’s that criterion:

Tokens that were wrapped (for example, WBNB) or pegged (for example, BTCB) and supported by the Binance “Token Canal” Project were lost.


Tokens were transferred to verified BEP20 contract addresses found on bscscan.com. These losses can then be publicly confirmed as taking the asset permanently out of circulation.


Tokens were lost due to a quinine error valued over $1,000, less than the projected BNB Auto-Burn amount in the coming quarter.

These recognized tokens would be otherwise burned in the quarterly auto-burn and distributed to qualified applications. So, the lost tokens will then be dropped into that quarter’s burn.
How Does BNB Auto-Burn Work?
BNB auto-burn utilizes on-chain information provided by the BNB Smart Chain to calculate the amount the BNB should burn. This process also ensures “adjusting” the amount of burnt fuel. The supply and demand dynamics also influenced the amount burned, where a decrease in the price of BNB reduces the burn rate. Coin burns increase the value of a given cryptocurrency.
BNB auto-burn is considered independent of Binance BNB trading volume to ensure that the whole process is verifiable, objective, and transparent in the view of the entire BNB community. The goal is to keep the auto-burn running until it reaches 100 million. As already discussed, the formula to calculate the total amount of BNB to burn is B=N*1000.
B in the above formula represents the total amount of BNB to burn, and N implies the number of blocks produced in every quarter on the BNB Smart Chain. Taking the average block time to be 3 seconds translates to the total number of blocks produced in an hour being 1,200 blocks. Plugging this into a standard calculation, N would approximately be 2,592,000 and may change depending on how many days there are in a given month during a given quarter.
P denotes the average price of BNB. The sampling median value depends on the accepted oracle provider, ChainLink, for BSC, with daily fluctuation of average prices between 10% to 20%.

K is the anchoring constant price beginning at 1000. Its value constantly changes, so it mostly relies on the BNB Smart Chain community. Members may alter it by making a BEP proposal and voting in a community.
How Can I View the BNB Auto-Burn History?
So what is the count of burnt numbers history so far of BNB? Total BNB burnt to date is 50,302,027.74 BNB. This amounts to $11,795,484.75. You can also keep tabs on present values and information about the events of BNB burning in real-time.
The last Q3 2023 BNB Burn case burned 2,139,182.98 BNB (or $501,617,017.54) via auto-burn. It is expected that during Q4 of 2023, the expected BNB burn may be 2,150,241.18 ($490,558,818.468). 
Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao typically announces BNB burn dates on Twitter, so keep an eye on that feed for information about the next auto burn.
Conclusion
The BNB auto-burn system entails new mechanisms in reducing the supply of tokens and at the same value raise the price of the token like BEP-95 real-time burning and quarterly auto-burn events. This depicts a new transparent path with full community involvement led by the legendary CEO, Changpeng Zhao of Binance.
The BNB auto-burn system is formula-driven and uses on-chain data to ensure correctness and make it dynamic to the market conditions. The path to 100 million then emerges as a transparent and community-driven process that helps long-term trust building for viability and value appreciation of the BNB ecosystem with more than 50 million BNB already burned. Stay tuned for the announcements of the burn dates by Changpeng Zhao in his Twitter feed, as well as details of how the team is working towards enhancing the auto-burn experience for BNB holders.

DOGE Fan Billionaire Mark Cuban Responds to Dogecoin Founder's Confession on X


Billionaire, investor and cohost of the Shark Tank show Mark Cuban has responded to a tweet by Dogecoin cofounder Billy Markus about his major activity on the X social media platform.Markus created the original meme cryptocurrency, Dogecoin, 11 years ago – in 2013. Cuban happens to be one of the top-tier Dogecoin fans. He used to be the principal owner of the Mavericks basketball team, which accepted DOGE for tickets and merchandise. However, in November last year, Cuban sold almost all his stake in the team and now owns only 27% of it for more than $3 billion.In January, during an AMA (“ask me anything”) session on X, Cuban assured that the Mavericks still accept DOGE. The team has been accepting Dogecoin as payment since 2021, being the first ever sports team to accept crypto.Cuban offers supporting hand to DOGE founderA few years prior to that, Cuban was a vocal cryptocurrency critic, who stated that buying bananas makes more sense than buying Bitcoin – at least one can eat the bananas. However, recently, he has been not only a big fan of DOGE but also of Bitcoin, Ethereum and several other top cryptos.Cuban has responded to a recent “confession” by the Dogecoin founder. Billy Markus shared his position on s-posting and complaining on social media, making sort of a confession on that point.Mark Cuban supported Markus, and they both agreed that “positive trolling” is “never silly.” Markus comments on "big announcement for DOGE"As reported by U.Today, Markus was asked about the timing of when he plans to make a “big announcement for DOGE.” The Dogecoin cofounder responded, saying that he does not plan to make any such announcements.He reminded the X user that he had withdrawn from the Dogecoin project more than 10 years ago; both he and Jackson Palmer did that almost immediately after the meme coin was launched.Initially, DOGE was created as a parody of Bitcoin (based on the BTC code), as an alternative cryptocurrency based on the meme dog Kabosu and not at all a serious competitor to Bitcoin.Markus still holds a tiny DOGE stash and very little Bitcoin, as he tweeted at the start of the year.

First Bitcoin-backed synthetic dollar to launch with 25% yield

Hermetica has announced the launch of the first-ever Bitcoin-backed synthetic United States dollar with yield-generating capabilities in the latest development for Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (DeFi).Slated for release in June, the new synthetic dollar, USDh, will offer users yields of up to 25%, according to Hermetica’s announcement shared with Cointelegraph.The new synthetic dollar will enable Bitcoiners to hold and earn yield on their U.S. dollars without the need to trust the banking system or gain exposure to non-Bitcoin-related products, according to Jakob Schillinger, founder and CEO of Hermetica Labs.Schillinger told Cointelegraph:“USDh will play a pivotal role in bringing increased liquidity and new use-cases to Bitcoin DeFi, allowing Bitcoiners to trade, lend, and transact in a dollar asset that is fully backed by Bitcoin.”Hermetica is a Stacks-native DeFi protocol on Bitcoin and part of a wider movement known as Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi), which aims to bring DeFi capabilities to the world’s first blockchain network.Related: ‘Mr. 100’ buys the Bitcoin dip for the first time since halving — Is the BTC bottom in?Is 25% yield sustainable in the long term?The launch of the first Bitcoin (BTC)-backed synthetic dollar comes two months after Ethena’s USDe launched with a 27.6% yield for holders, creating widespread concerns about the protocol’s sustainability.Similar concerns could arise for Hermetica’s USDh, as the 25% annual percentage yield (APY) is considerably higher than the 20% yield offered by Anchor Protocol on TerraUSD (UST) before the algorithmic stablecoin issuer Terra collapsed in May 2022.According to Hermetica’s CEO, the yield is sustainable and derived from futures funding rates. Schillinger explained:“This Bitcoin-native yield fluctuates with the market’s demand for long leverage. Our backtest data from January 2021 to March 2024 shows an average APY of 11.71%. In the 2022 bull market, the annual return was 26.11%.”Schillinger added that the demand for Bitcoin futures will keep USDh yield sustainable:“The yield is sustainable due to the structural demand for long leverage in the Bitcoin futures markets.”Increasingly, more protocols are building more utility and DeFi capabilities around Bitcoin, the world’s most secure blockchain network. Schillinger believes that the introduction of Ordinals was among the most important catalysts for BTCFi. He said:“We believe Bitcoin DeFi will match and eclipse the size of Ethereum DeFi in the next 5 years. We're already seeing months where Ordinals trading volumes are higher than volumes for Ethereum and Solana NFTs combined. With over $1T in latent BTC capital, Bitcoin DeFi is primed for explosive growth.”Related: Biggest Friend.tech whale dumps tokens as users struggle to claim airdrop

Mango Markets DAO buyback plan leads to accusations of ‘self-dealing’

An April 7 plan to buy back tokens at a premium to market price has led to controversy within the governing body of decentralized finance protocol Mango Markets. Some community members claimed that the buyback was orchestrated to benefit the buyer of the FTX estate’s stash of MNGO tokens. These tokens were transferred from FTX to an anonymous account only a few days before the plan was proposed, implying that they may have been purchased as part of an over-the-counter deal.Critics of the plan accused its originator, DonDuala, of being connected to the FTX buyer. DonDuala did not comment on this accusation within the Discord forum. Other members supported the plan, claiming it made sense for the organization to purchase MNGO tokens even if it benefited the mysterious FTX estate buyer. Supporters contended that the MNGO token is underpriced in the market and, therefore, should be repurchased as a way of distributing profits to investors. An amended version of the buyback plan was approved on April 24. Mango Markets is a Web3 app that allows crypto users to borrow and lend out various cryptocurrencies. It runs on the Solana network and is governed by MNGO tokenholders, who collectively form its governing body, the decentralized autonomous organization Mango DAO. The protocol was exploited for $116 million via a flash loan attack in October 2022, and its token price is down by more than 25% over its preexploit value, according to data from CoinMarketCap.Don Duala makes a token buyback proposalOn April 7, Mango DAO member DonDuala posted a proposal to its forum on Discord. DonDuala suggested that the DAO should buy back 275 million MNGO from its current holders, thereby reducing the token’s circulating supply. In exchange, the DAO should offer holders 9.995 million of the Dai (DAI) stablecoin derivative CHAI, valued at approximately $10.7 million. This implied a buyback price of $0.032 per MNGO token. The price of MNGO on April 7 was $0.02324, according to CoinMarketCap, over 27% less than the implied buyback price.Mango DAO buyback proposal. Source: Mango Markets, DiscordTo facilitate this exchange, the DAO would issue options tokens that could be exercised by individual holders. To prevent the tokens from being distributed to exchanges and other automated systems, only accounts that participated in the proposal’s vote would receive the options.Community discovers mysterious FTX “buyer”On April 11, DAO member Donderper discovered that a mysterious account had received MNGO from the estate of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, and that this account was now using these tokens to vote in favor of the buyback proposal. “Holy shit,” Donderper exclaimed. “Did FTX estate just enter the chat?” They posted a screenshot reportedly showing the account voting in favor of the proposal. At the time, it represented 6.67% of the total votes cast. Donderper notices FTX buyer vote. Source: Mango Markets, DiscordDonderper suggested that the actions of this account were “shady,” stating: “[A] week before this proposal starts being talked about FTX estate starts transferring out all 333 million of its tokens into an account that gets used in this vote.” They speculated that “someone cut a deal with FTX for to buy their mngo for [$0.01]” and then made a proposal to have the DAO buy it back for $0.038. They claimed that the account may be poised to make $2 million in net profit by selling half of its coins. Donderper did not post any evidence of the price at which the alleged over-the-counter trade took place. Blockchain data shows only that a known FTX account transferred the tokens to a different account.Some community members began to imply that DonDuala and another DAO member, Maximilian, may be affiliated with the FTX-related account. “Wow, this is super shady. @DonDuala / @Maximilian,” one member stated, asking, “Are you aware who controls this account?” Another member responded, “They 100% know,” calling the transfer “a backdoor deal.”Comment from Mango DAO participants. Source: Mango markets, DiscordIn a post later that day, DonDuala sidestepped the question of whether they were affiliated with the FTX buyer and instead responded to criticism of the proposal. DonDuala stated that the focus on the FTX buyer seemed to be a distraction from the core issue at stake in the proposal. “Understandably there’s a lot of dislike for FTX and the way the estate handled the liquidation proceedings,” they stated, “but today’s uproar in response to those tokens voting seem misplaced.” DonDuala argued that the proposal should pass because it represented support for “market efficiency.” They stated, “No votes are a vote against market efficiency, yes votes defend the token while preserving optionality that the DAO continues on its best footing.”Related: Mango Markets hires representative to handle US regulatory scrutinyThe proposal fails and is resurrectedOn April 12, the initial proposal was voted down, with 52.3% of tokens being used to vote against it. DonDuala then resubmitted the proposal with amendments. In the new version, the DAO would buy back only 156 million MNGO, slightly more than half of what the original proposal had suggested. In addition, options would be distributed to all users who had deposited into Mango DAO’s Realm governance system, regardless of whether they participated in the vote for this particular proposal.On April 20, Mango Markets co-founder Daffy Durairaj posted a lengthy argument against the new proposal’s passage. Durairaj claimed that DonDuala and Maximilian were being “completely mercenary” and were “willing to say and do whatever in order to improve their financial position.” Through private conversations, Durairaj had learned that “there is a large amount of money at stake and they don’t intend to negotiate.” He claimed that the two of them were engaged in “untrustworthy behavior and self-dealing” and that “these behaviors are by themselves reasons to vote against this proposal.”Durairaj suggested that the DAO could support the token price through other means once the proposal was defeated but argued that this particular buyback proposal should not be accepted.Daffy Durairaj’s comment on the buyback plan.

Investopedia refers to these investors as “corporate raiders.” According to the Cornell Law School’s Legal Information Institute, corporate raiding is legal in the United States, but poison pill and regulatory taxes often make the raids unprofitable.Related: AAVE DAO debates reimbursement plan for AMPL depositorsOn April 18, Avrham Eisenberg was found guilty of fraud for carrying out the Mango Markets exploit.

Colin Wu has highlighted the impressive growth of SolvBTC.



SolvBTC has attracted more than 12,000 BTC in Arbitrum, BNB Chain, and Merlin Chain.



Solv Protocol partnered with Babylon to bridge native restaking yields on SolvBTC.




Foremost Chinese blockchain and crypto reporter Colin Wu has highlighted the impressive growth of SolvBTC, a Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency protocol. In a recent post on X, Wu described SolvBTC as a Bitcoin ecosystem liquidity center invested by Binance. 







Citing the protocol’s growth and development, Wu noted that SolvBTC has attracted more than 12,000 BTC in Arbitrum, BNB Chain, and Merlin Chain. According to the renowned journalist, with a total value locked (TVL) of more than $800 million, Solv has signified its intention to connect to more BTC income sources soon.



Wu spotted Babylon’s restaking income as one of the BTC income sources identified by Solv for potential integration. He noted that the number of networks supporting SolvBTC bridging is increasing, citing networks like zkSync and Linea.



Wu’s report comes after Solv Protocol announced a recent partnership with Babylon. In a post on X, the liquidity center noted that connecting with Babylon will enable it to bridge native BTC restaking yields on SolvBTC. 









According to the protocol, integrating with Babylon will enable SolvBTC to support the security of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chains, roll-ups, and Active Validated Services (AVS). It will also help to unlock the use cases for the considerable idle liquidity of Bitcoin.



In a Medium post, Solv Protocol noted that as a native yield platform, Solv utilizes SolvBTC to establish an inclusive and dynamic BTCFi ecosystem. It further highlighted that Solv would serve as a yield tokenization layer by tokenizing staking, restaking, and DeFi trading yields into SolvBTC. Furthermore, the protocol noted that the integration with Babylon would bring Bitcoin’s liquidity into various DeFi protocols, sparking the growth of a thriving BTCFi economy.

Robinhood crypto business slapped with SEC Wells Notice

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a Wells Notice to the popular trading platform Robinhood.Following the news of the Wells Notice, Robinhood (HOOD) share price fell 2.5% in pre-market trading, to $17.95 as of 12:50 pm UTC. The Wells Notice was issued on May 4, according to court filings.The Wells Notice is a letter sent from the securities regulator that concludes the conclusion of its investigation over the respondent, in this case, Robinhood’s United States-based crypto business.According to the filing, the SEC has been investigating Robinhood’s cryptocurrency listings, crypto custodian operations and made the “preliminary determination” to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action related to alleged securities violations.The news of the investigation comes despite Robinhood’s attempts to register with the United States securities watchdog, according to Dan Gallagher, chief legal, compliance, and corporate affairs officer at Robinhood Markets.Gallagher wrote in a May 6 blog post:“After years of good faith attempts to work with the SEC for regulatory clarity including our well-known attempt to ‘come in and register,’ we are disappointed that the agency has decided to issue a Wells Notice related to our U.S. crypto business.”Gallagher added that Robinhood doesn’t see any of its listed assets as securities:“We firmly believe that the assets listed on our platform are not securities and we look forward to engaging with the SEC to make clear just how weak any case against Robinhood Crypto would be on both the facts and the law.”Related: FTX addresses transferred $8.3M one day before amended proposal deadlineCrypto regulatory landscape is akin to equities regulations in 1932Robinhood has been striving to avoid securities violations. As part of its efforts, it previously chose not to list certain tokens or provide crypto lending and staking services that the SEC has previously alleged to be securities offering during lawsuits against other platforms.However, Robinhood’s chief compliance officer noted that the lack of federal regulatory clarity created an uneven playing field for market participants, making regulatory compliance difficult and hindering mainstream crypto adoption.In a June 6 court testimony, Gallagher, who previously served as an SEC commissioner from 2011 to 2015, said:“Unfortunately, Robinhood and other digital asset market participants in the U.S. face a patchwork of state regulatory frameworks, not all of which are consistent, as well as a lack of regulatory clarity at the federal level. In many ways, the regulatory landscape for digital assets is like it was for the equities markets in 1932.”The SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have yet to issue clear guidelines on what they deem as securities and commodities in relation to digital assets.Related: Bitcoin enters ‘new era’ as whales scoop up over 47K BTC during price pullback

Cardano (ADA) has reached a significant milestone, recording a staggering 90 million transactions on its network. This achievement comes at a pivotal moment for Cardano as it prepares to implement game-changing upgrades.Cardano, often hailed for its robust and research-driven approach to blockchain development, has steadily gained traction within the cryptocurrency community since its inception. The achievement of 90 million transactions serves as a testament to Cardano's growing adoption and utility, highlighting its ability to support a diverse range of use cases and transaction types.As Cardano continues to expand its reach and capabilities, the timing of this milestone is particularly significant, coinciding with the imminent rollout of network upgrades that promise to unlock new levels of innovation and functionality. One of the most anticipated upgrades is the Ouroboros Genesis, which will be deployed as part of the Chang upgrade, which is expected to take place this summer. This enables nodes to self-bootstrap from the Cardano network. According to Input Output Global (IOG), the next and final waypoint on the path to full P2P node operations is expected to arrive with the Ouroboros Genesis release.Other upgrades, including that to Plutus, the smart contract platform of the Cardano blockchain, might as well be in the offing. Rick McCracken DIGI, a Caradano SPO, outlined some Cardano Plutus V3 capabilities coming in 2024, which include increased performance and throughput, efficient smart contract size, smart contract migration from Ethereum, creation of side chain bridges and Mithril integration and governance-related script execution. With these network upgrades on the horizon, Cardano is poised to enter a new era of innovation and growth, driving further adoption and value creation for its ecosystem and community.

Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY) Will Rally 6,000% After Solana Launch, as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Solana Doggy presents a similar opportunity.



Solana Doggy has a market cap around $13,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 6,000% in the coming two days, and Solana Doggy could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Solana Doggy can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Solana Doggy on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Solana Doggy by entering its contract address – 3f3XRScU3PnaXvsZ4ZGjxDa15SmbhWeMLxHmSyNngaAE – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SOLDOGGY.

No bull market for the price of Bitcoin?

Today the price of Bitcoin briefly returned above $65,000, but according to several analysts there are no signs indicating the beginning of a new bull market in the short term. 
Last week it had dropped below $57,000 for a brief moment, only to rise back above $58,000 in less than 24 hours, and above $60,000 in less than 48. 
On Friday, the price of Bitcoin had managed to rise above $63,000, and the following day above $64,000. 
However, this +13% in a few days does not seem to be enough at all to suggest a return of the bull market.

The period of consolidation
After reaching an all-time high on March 14th at $73,800, the price of Bitcoin went through three subsequent drops. 
To be honest, after the first drop to $61,000 in the second half of March, BTC had managed to rise back above $70,000, but only until the second drop, which occurred in mid-April. Since then, it has not been able to rise above $70,000 again, and in fact has struggled to rise above $67,000.
The third drop, which occurred several days after the halving on April 20, seems to have ended on May 1 just below $57,000, but the return to $65,000 does not seem sufficient to affirm that the post-halving retracement is over. 
However, below $59,000 there seems to be a strong resistance platform that extends up to $57,000, so much so that there are several analysts who believe that the price of Bitcoin is unlikely to fall below these values, if not for a very short time.
So in case this platform holds, it is possible that on March 15th a long period of sideways movement has been triggered that could last for many more weeks. 
Bitcoin Price: Bitget’s analysis on the possibility of a bull market?
According to analyst Ryan Lee of Bitget, it is likely that the price of Bitcoin will fluctuate between $58,000 and $72,000 for another one or two months.
It is worth noting that before jumping for the first time in its history above $70,000 in March 2024, the price of Bitcoin had traded sideways for a few weeks just above $50,000 in February.
In fact, some analysts expect a possible return to a range between $50,000 and $53,000, but to do so, the platform formed in the last two months below $59,000 would need to be broken.
Lee also points out that the implied volatility of BTC and ETH has significantly decreased in the last month, indicating that traders do not expect a significant increase in volatility in the short term market. 
Even the outflows that occurred in the last two weeks on Bitcoin ETFs indicate a situation that does not seem to be ready for the start of a new bull run, as they clearly indicate short-term profit-taking.
However, at least GBTC has recorded its first net inflow since becoming an ETF, so it is not surprising that short-term selling pressure on the market has temporarily eased.
For Lee, it is also quite clear that there is support for the price of Bitcoin at lower levels than the current one.
The situation on the markets
Lee also points out that the Fed’s Net Liquidity Index has started to decrease, and that the growth of stablecoin market capitalization overall has slowed down. 
These data confirm the correction of the crypto market in the last month, but there are other data suggesting that the situation could change in the medium term.
According to Lee, the Fed is already considering a path of interest rate cuts, judging by the results of the rate meeting where the downward trend in inflation, the increase in the unemployment rate to 4.5%, and the risks related to liquidity were discussed. 
Currently the market seems to consider only one interest rate cut by the Fed this year, but the crypto market could also anticipate in advance a possible early and broader interest rate cut starting from September or November of this year. 
In light of this, Lee argues that the next peak of the Bitcoin bull market will be around September.
The main sectors that could undergo significant changes are the BTC ecosystem (new protocols and assets like Rune, ARC20, BTC layer 2), memecoins, and the AI sector.
The trend for the price of Bitcoin in the coming months: bull-market on the way?
So, basically, it seems unlikely that the price of Bitcoin can reach new highs in May, and perhaps even in June, but it could also manage to stay within a range above $57,000 or $58,000.
This also implies that from the $65,000 touched today, a new price drop of perhaps more than 10% could be triggered, with the possibility of going even further, although it appears unlikely. 
However, the scenario changes as we move away from May and approach September, with a return of the possibilities of reaching new highs.

Tom Brady Wasn't Laughing at Crypto Jokes During Netflix Roast


In an event designed to be filled with laughter and light-hearted jabs, NFL legend Tom Brady found himself at the center of a Netflix roast that hit a bit too close to home. 
The comedy special, “The Greatest Roast of All Time,” saw Brady facing sharp barbs from comedians, including Nikki Glaser. However, one particular joke about his financial losses in cryptocurrency visibly unsettled the seven-time Super Bowl champion.
Tom Brady’s Reaction to Crypto Jokes
During the event at the Los Angeles Forum, Glaser poked fun at Brady’s ill-fated investments in crypto, particularly his association with the now-defunct crypto company FTX. 

“Tom also lost 30 million dollars in crypto… Tom, how did you fall for that? Even Gronk said, ‘I know that’s not real money,'” Glaser quipped. 


This remark, which referenced Brady’s former teammate Rob Gronkowski, was met with mixed reactions from the audience.


Tom Brady’s connection to FTX goes deeper than just bad investment choices. He served as an ambassador for the company and, alongside his then-wife, Gisele Bundchen, received substantial stock as compensation for promoting FTX. 
Brady and Bundchen are now facing legal challenges, as they and other celebrity endorsers are being sued by FTX investors seeking repayment after the company’s collapse.
FTX, once a behemoth in the crypto market with a valuation of $32 billion, filed for bankruptcy in November last year, rendering its stock, including the $48 million held by Brady and Bundchen, worthless. The downfall of FTX also brought legal troubles for its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces federal fraud charges.

The roast, intended as a playful tribute to one of football’s greatest players, inadvertently underscored the real-life drama and financial turmoil Brady faces. Despite his achievements on the field, his off-field financial decisions have brought a significant share of scrutiny and stress, as reflected in the night’s uneasy laughter.

82 Million Shiba Inu Burned: Can Price Surge 24%?


Over 82.14 million Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens have been burned, resulting in an extraordinary 4,111.57% increase in the burn rate over the past 24 hours. 
Shibburn, the dedicated Shiba Inu burn tracker, monitored the development. 
Can Shiba Inu Price Surge 24%?
The process of burning these tokens involves permanently removing them from circulation by transferring them to a dead wallet. This method is strategically designed to decrease the overall supply of SHIB, thereby increasing its scarcity and potential market value. 
Following this recent burn, the total number of SHIB tokens destroyed has climbed to over 410 trillion, with roughly 589 million SHIB remaining in active circulation.

Read more: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Explained: Understanding Token Burning
Shiba Inu Burn Rate. Source: Shibburn
Despite the substantial volume of tokens burned, the immediate price impact on SHIB has been minimal. The 82 million SHIB destroyed in this latest event is approximately worth $2,035, which is relatively small and, therefore, not sufficient to trigger a significant price surge for the token.
Nevertheless, the sharp increase in the burn rate has revived optimism within the Shiba Inu community. Members and investors hope the upcoming SHIB burn portal will further amplify token deflation, potentially leading to more significant price movements. 


“Recent upgrades and bullish market stats support SHIB’s green trading trend,” Shiba Inu enthusiast Dylan wrote.

Moreover, Shiba Inu has implemented significant technological advancements in its quest to move beyond its meme coin origins. The introduction of Shibarium, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, marks a crucial step in enhancing the blockchain’s efficiency. 
This upgrade includes a major hard fork completed last week, which promises faster transactions and more stable gas fees, likely improving the overall user experience on the network.
Additionally, the Shiba Inu team reportedly raised $12 million in April to develop a new layer-3 blockchain. This fundraising effort attracted contributions from prominent investors such as Polygon Ventures, Mechanism Capital, and Animoca Brands.

Recent technical analysis from BeInCrypto suggested a potential 15% increase in SHIB’s price, aiming for $0.00002625. After reaching this level, the token experienced a modest decline of about 4%, reflecting ongoing market volatility. However, SHIB is now forming an inverse head and shoulder chart pattern.
Read more: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030

Analysis indicates that the potential breakout could elevate SHIB’s price by over 24% to $0.00003103. However, should this breakout not occur, the token might find support at approximately $0.00002349.

Turkish crypto bill: 5 things to know before it’s introduced

The government of Turkey, one of the biggest cryptocurrency economies in the world, is expected to introduce crypto-related legislation sometime this year.Turkish Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek announced in January that local crypto legislation was almost complete. Many expected the Turkish parliament to start regulating the crypto market in early 2024, but the draft legislation is yet to be introduced.As Turkey’s regulatory silence on crypto may leave one wondering when the legislation is coming and what is the current status of crypto regulation in Turkey, Cointelegraph spoke to some local industry enthusiasts to clarify some of the issues.Turkey already has some “light” crypto regulationsWhile the Turkish government has yet to introduce crypto legislation, it doesn’t mean that there are no rules to regulate the market in the country today.According to local cryptocurrency mentor Ismail Hakki Polat, there are currently “very slight regulations” targeting crypto in Turkey, but parliament does not set them.Turkey has two main crypto-related regulations:  One was initiated by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey in 2021, which prohibits crypto holders from making payments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as such assets are not legal tender.“Since it’s not a regulation passed by the parliament, nobody knows what are the consequences, penalties and fines of violating these rules,” Polat told Cointelegraph. “Let's say, this regulation is with no legs on the ground,” he added.The second regulation relates to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures and works under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance’s financial intelligence unit, the Financial Crimes Investigation Board, also known as MASAK. This regulation requires exchanges to collect certain Know Your Customer (KYC) data from users in order to prevent illicit activities like money laundering and terrorism financing.According to Mindstone Blockchain Labs CEO Tansel Kaya, there is also crypto-related guidance by the Capital Markets Board of Turkey (CMB), known as SPK (Sermaye Piyasası Kurulu).“The SPK said anybody or any institution related to the authority shall not trade cryptocurrencies,” Kaya said, adding that this includes Turkish banks, broker dealers and others. He emphasized that this regulation is “very old” as the CMB issued this guidance in 2018.Turkey is the fourth-largest crypto trading market in the worldTurkey is a major global cryptocurrency economy and is one of the countries with the highest adoption rate of crypto in the world.According to data from Chainanalysis, Turkey is the fourth-largest crypto market worldwide in terms of estimated trading volume of $170 billion, ahead of countries like Russia, Canada, Vietnam, Thailand and Germany.Source: ChainalysisIn September 2023, Turkey’s national currency, the lira, became the top cryptocurrency trading pair on Binance, accounting for 75% of all fiat trading volume. The event was attributed to a significant influx of crypto investors in the Turkish market.Some studies claimed that Turkey’s adoption rate has more than doubled in the past few years, reaching 40%. That study suggested that two in every five Turkish citizens hold crypto.“The number of Turkish cryptocurrency investors is estimated to be 20 million, among 85 million of the total population of our country,” Polat said.Why does Turkey want to adopt crypto regulations in 2024?Turkey's anticipated crypto legislation is poised to aid the country in exiting the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) "gray list" associated with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures. The regulator placed Turkey on its “gray list” in October 2021 over disproportionate regulation of the nonprofit organization sector.According to Polat, Turkey is required to solve 39 action items in order to be upgraded from the FATF’s “gray list,” with one of them being related to the crypto industry. The FATF requires countries to comply with its framework to ensure that virtual assets are not used for criminal activities.Turkey’s crypto law will address crypto exchanges, taxes and moreTurkey’s upcoming crypto regulatory legislation will mainly address regulation and licensing crypto exchanges.The regulation will define the liabilities and responsibilities of exchanges, referred to as virtual asset service providers (VASPs) in the FATF’s framework. The law will also focus on standards related to safe custody, or the storage of crypto assets by VASPs in order to ensure maximum protection of investors.The investor protection aspect became a burning issue in Turkey after the collapse of a major local crypto exchange called Thodex. The Thodex exchange abruptly halted trading and withdrawals in April 2021. Thodex founder Faruk Fatih Özer was eventually sentenced to 11,196 years in 2023 on indictment of fraud estimated at as high as $2 billion.In addition to VASP regulations, the upcoming crypto law is expected to finally provide a legal foundation for crypto taxes in Turkey.Related: Turkey tops the world in stablecoin buying share vs. GDPAccording to local reports, Turkey’s Revenue Administration plans to impose low-rate transaction taxes on crypto, one of which is the Banking and Insurance Transactions Tax (BSMV), whose rate is 5% today. The government is also expected to require citizens to declare their earnings on crypto but reportedly plans to set the withholding tax rate to zero.Additionally, the upcoming bill is expected to address regulation of tokenizing real-world assets.When Turkey is expected to introduce crypto legislation?It is unclear when Turkey is expected to finally release its crypto legislation despite many publications expecting to see some progress early this year.Some industry observers have linked the timing of the introduction of Turkey’s crypto law to the upcoming meeting of the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control in June.“That’s when they will consider removing Turkey from the gray list. The law likely has to be passed and then the regulations have to be in effect before that,” Kaya told Cointelegraph, adding that the regulation is expected in May.“My view or my guess is it will be at the end of this parliamentary season, which is, let's say, June,” Polat noted, adding:“But if they are not able to, then it means that it will be shifted to autumn or maybe the end of the year. So in my view the gray list issue is now a bit dropped from the agenda.”Magazine: CZ gets jail sentence, Gensler viewed Ether as security, and FBI targets mixers: Hodler’s Digest, April 28 – May 4

Chinese scholars agree on merits of Bitcoin


China has been a rather chaotic place for Bitcoin (BTC) investors, traders, and miners for years, with the country making headlines in 2013 for banning activity related to the cryptocurrency.
The ban has, however, not been total and BTC has maintained a presence in China throughout the years. 
Additionally, contrary to popular perception, the People’s Republic has been very involved with investigating and developing blockchain technology, as best exemplified by the work done on the digital yuan but also by other actions such as the release of plans for national Web3 development in late 2023.


In 2024, China will continue work on developing a comprehensive framework for handling cryptocurrencies with the latest chapter taking place in Nanjing in late April. 
Bitcoin set to officially be recognized as property in China
The seminar in question, hosted by the Nanjing People’s Procuratorate, was focused on assessing whether Bitcoin constitutes property and can, therefore, be subjected to laws pertaining to property crimes.
The conclusion was overwhelmingly that Bitcoin does have value and should be considered property, with additional discussion on how exactly it should be treated and how best to protect individuals who have suffered financial damage from actions such as BTC theft.
While the seminar opens the gates for further solidifying the coin’s legal status – at the time of publication, Bitcoin is ‘not completely banned,’ ‘not a contraband,’ and ‘can be traded and has economic value’ per a summary made by Colin Wu on X – a lot of attention has been given to how the value of BTC should be determined. 

Ultimately, though the Nanjing seminar did not end the discussion on how cryptocurrencies should be handled and regulated in China, it constitutes a major milestone in guaranteeing a place for them in the country’s law and affording them a legal status.

Coinbase Hires Ex-Mayors To Bridge Crypto And Policy Divide - Coinbase Glb (NASDAQ:COIN) - Benzinga

Coinbase Inc. COIN has made a significant addition to its Global Advisory Council by welcoming former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Atlanta Mayor and White House Senior Advisor Keisha Bottoms.What Happened: These new appointments aim to leverage their political and policy-making expertise to advance Coinbase’s mission of promoting economic freedom worldwide.Faryar Shirzad, Chief Policy Officer at Coinbase, expressed enthusiasm about the new members, stating they would play a crucial role in guiding the leadership team on strategic decisions impacting global economic policies. This move aligns with Coinbase’s objective to build bridges between policymakers and the American populace, particularly focusing on the underbanked sectors.According to statistics shared by Shirzad, 18% of Americans, including 25% of Black and Hispanic households, are underbanked, indicating a significant portion of the population that the traditional financial system fails to serve adequately.Also Read: Hong Kong Spot Bitcoin ETFs Do Have A ‘Benefit,’ Bloomberg ETF Analyst Points OutVillaraigosa highlighted the potential of cryptocurrencies as a promising alternative for communities historically facing racial discrimination in traditional banking sectors.

During his recent appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box show, venture investor and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano (commonly known as Pomp within the cryptocurrency community) shared with the anchors what has been pushing Bitcoin up since Friday.Pomp stated that despite being volatile on a day-to-day basis, Bitcoin continues to grow since the start of the year.Drivers fueling Bitcoin price recovery, 200-day MA’s ATHPompliano admitted that the price action around the recent halving has been playing out the way it was expected. Historically, a month before a halving occurs, the price runs up about 19%, and in the month after the halving, BTC goes up approximately only 1-2%. This is what we can more or less see at the moment, he pointed out. Still, since Friday, the world’s flagship cryptocurrency has increased by more than 10%. The price surge, Pomp stated, was spurred by the fact that on Friday, for the first time since January, Grayscale’s GBTC ETF saw a $63 million inflow after four months of consistent outflows. Pomp reminded the audience that this is the largest Bitcoin ETF, and with the first inflows starting to come in, the price was stimulated to rise.Another important driver named by Pomp was the fact that the 200-day moving average for Bitcoin has reached an all-time high, soaring above $50,000 for the first time.After going above the $65,000 level earlier today, though, the paramount cryptocurrency has been pushed back down 2.14%, and at the time of this writing, it is changing hands at $63,800.

Philippines Eyes Crypto Regulation Guidelines by Year-End - DailyCoin


        
The Philippines SEC has disclosed plans to regulate crypto.



The revelation comes after an intense crypto crackdown.



Unregistered exchanges were nabbed in the crackdown, including Binance.
The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revealed plans to introduce a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto as early as this year.  The SEC’s disclosure follows a recent nationwide crackdown on unlicensed crypto service providers in the country, including Binance, which the regulator accused of offering unregistered securities.Philippines Crypto RegulationAccording to a May 6 BusinessWorld report, SEC Chairperson Emilio B. Aquino told reporters that the commission would issue the regulatory framework “by the second of this year.” The upcoming guidelines will cover crypto assets and their trading activities, with the primary goal of safeguarding investor interests.
While the guidelines will likely be implemented once approved later in the year, Aquino reiterated that the SEC requires crypto exchanges to obtain the necessary licenses and registrations before setting up in the country, as mandated by the Securities Regulation Code (SRC).“They have to secure the required licenses because the intention is to be able to run after them to exact their obligations. That is just where we are coming from. We’re not singling out any of these platforms. That’s our direction,” Aquino stated.On the SEC’s move against Binance and other unregistered trading platforms, Aquino said the regulator was just doing “its job.” However, the chairperson noted that some traders could still access blocked or unregulated platforms via VPNs.“I know there are still some investors who we are not even stopping because they’re going to it via virtual private networks. They still can. But nobody gets to blame us,” the report quoted Aquino.The report did not clarify whether the guidelines will be formulated at the commission or parliament level.

Study Uncovers Surprising Data: 90% Of Stablecoin Transactions Not Driven By Human Users


                            In a recent report by Bloomberg, it has been revealed that more than 90% of stablecoin transaction volumes do not originate from genuine users, according to a new metric co-developed by Visa.
Stablecoin Market Faces Data Reality
Visa and Allium Labs have created a dashboard designed to filter out transactions initiated by bots and large-scale traders to isolate those made by real individuals. Out of approximately $2.2 trillion in total transactions recorded in April, a mere $149 billion was identified as “organic payments activity” by Visa.
The data challenges the optimistic outlook of stablecoin proponents who believe these tokens can transform the $150 trillion payments industry. 

Fintech giants such as PayPal Inc. and Stripe Inc. have been exploring stablecoins, with Stripe co-founder John Collison expressing bullishness on the tokens due to “technical improvements.” 
Pranav Sood, the executive general manager for EMEA at payments platform Airwallex, commented on the findings: “It says that stablecoins are still in a very nascent moment in their evolution as a payment instrument.” 
Sood emphasized the need to focus on increasing existing payment infrastructure in the short and mid-term while acknowledging the long-term potential of stablecoins.
Accurately tracking crypto activity’s “real” value using blockchain data has always been challenging. Glassnode, a data provider, estimates that the record $3 trillion assigned to digital tokens at the bull market’s peak in 2021 was closer to $875 billion.
Analysts Predict Massive Surge Ahead
According to Bloomberg, the nature of stablecoin transactions often leads to double-counting, depending on the platform users employ for fund transfers. For example, converting $100 of Circle’s USDC stablecoin to PayPal’s PYUSD on the decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap would result in $200 of total stablecoin volume being recorded on-chain.
Visa, which processed over $12 trillion the previous year, could suffer if stablecoins gain widespread acceptance as payment. 
Interestingly, despite this troubling data, analysts at Bernstein predicted that the total value of all stablecoins in circulation could reach $2.8 trillion by 2028, nearly 18 times their current combined circulation.

While PayPal and Stripe have made strides in adopting stablecoins, Airwallex has observed limited demand for stablecoin-based payment solutions among its customers, primarily due to concerns about “user-friendliness.” 
Sood emphasized the significant barrier of overcoming entrenched payment methods, citing the continued use of checks for 40% to 60% of business payments in the United States.
The Bloomberg report sheds light on the dominance of non-genuine user activity in stablecoin transactions. The study underscores the importance of improving existing payment infrastructure and addressing user-friendly concerns to unlock the long-term potential of stablecoins.

Robinhood Challenges SEC Notice, Asserts Crypto Compliance


Robinhood has officially responded to a Wells Notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which challenges its operations. 
This notice hints at possible enforcement actions related to Robinhood Crypto (RHC), the firm’s crypto division.
Robinhood ‘Disappointed’ With SEC Wells Notice
Dan Gallagher, Robinhood’s Chief Legal, Compliance, and Corporate Affairs Officer, expressed disappointment with the regulatory agency’s decision. 

“After years of good faith attempts to work with the SEC for regulatory clarity including our well-known attempt to ‘come in and register,’ we are disappointed that the agency has decided to issue a Wells Notice related to our U.S. crypto business,” Gallagher stated. 


Robinhood argues that the cryptocurrencies listed on its platform do not qualify as securities and is ready to demonstrate the weakness of any SEC case against it factually and legally. The firm navigates cautiously with the regulatory reality, opting not to list certain tokens and avoiding services like crypto lending and staking, which the SEC has previously targeted on other platforms. 
The firm has also attempted to register a special purpose broker-dealer specifically to align with SEC regulations, showcasing its commitment to compliance.

However, the SEC argues that Robinhood uses the “Overview” tab of its Investor Relations website and its Newsroom to disseminate information to the public in a broad and non-exclusive way for purposes of the SEC’s Rule of Fair Disclosure.

“As it was revealed that Robinhood Crypto, LLC (“RHC”) received investigative subpoenas from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and on May 4, 2024, RHC received a “Wells Notice” stating that staff had informed RHC that it had made a “preliminary determination” to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against RHC alleging violations of Sections 15(a) and 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934″, SEC commented in a note.

This situation unfolds as the SEC scrutinizes the cryptocurrency market, focusing on compliance and the classification of digital assets. Robinhood’s ongoing dialogue with the SEC highlights the broader industry’s challenges in navigating an evolving regulatory framework.

Crypto phishing attacks plummet in April, reaching a yearly low of $38 million

Phishing attacks within the crypto industry decreased 46% to $38 million in April, the lowest amount this year, according to the security firm Scam Sniffer.Notably, this aligns with CertiK’s finding that crypto-related exploits and scams plummeted to a historic low of $25.7 million in April.April’s phishing attackPer Scam Sniffer’s findings, the Coinbase-backed Ethereum layer-2 network Base recorded a 145% surge to $8.2 million in phishing incidents during the past month. Two of the top 10 largest single thefts occurred on this chain, accounting for 21% of the month’s total theft.Top 10 Phishing Attacks in April. (Source: Scam Sniffer)Meanwhile, ERC-20 tokens bore the brunt of attacks, with 88% of the stolen assets belonging to this class.Scam Sniffer identified fake accounts on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) as the primary tool utilized by scammers. These attackers mimicked prominent projects like Renzo, Avail, and Ether.fi, Wormhole, and Omni, and their accounts often sport fake verification marks, lending an air of authenticity that is used to lure unsuspecting users.Using these accounts, the attackers post deceptive comments on social media platforms to drive unsuspecting individuals to malicious sites where their assets can be stolen.Additionally, the attackers usually employed phishing signatures such as Permit, IncreaseAllowance, and Uniswap Permit2. These malicious signatures grant the attackers access to their victim’s funds without their knowledge.Scam Sniffer added:“Despite wallets increasing phishing alerts for certain signatures, wallet drainers are actively finding ways around these alerts using legitimate contracts like Disperse and Uniswap Multicall, and variants of value normalization.”Mentioned in this article

Worldcoin (WLD) Rallies After Airing Controversial Commercial | Cryptopolitan

Worldcoin (WLD) is up nearly 19% in a day, and was among the top winners of last weekend’s recovery. As Bitcoin (BTC) returned above $64,000, selected altcoins also regained positions. The Worldcoin project showed it still achieves visibility, though hounded by some controversy. WLD moved up to a weekly high of $6.50, later to slide to $6.35. The asset is yet to return to its early April prices, where WLD touched $6.90 before correcting. In the new week, WLD trading volumes also expanded to $577M in 24 hours. With the latest earnings, WLD lined up among top weekly gainers, inviting additional attention. WLD has a relatively small free float of 200M tokens, with the Ethereum-based and Optimism versions competing for everyday use and trading. Will Worldcoin Fulfill Its Ambitious Agenda with Native BlockchainWorldcoin has set aside a total supply of 10B tokens, with the goal of mapping parts of the world economy. To reach that goal, Worldcoin may also partner with Open AI, where its co-founder Sam Altman is also the CEO.But the token distribution is slow, as it is tied to acquiring personal biometric data. Worldcoin became known for its Orb campaign, assigning tokens to new users that consented to have their iris data stored. That campaign led to around 3.6M wallets with WLD tokens running on the Optimism blockchain. Around 21K holders own tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. For a token-based project, those adoption numbers are decent, though far from the global goals. The launch of a native Worldcoin blockchain was announced relatively late. Worldcoin will follow the model of Optimism, creating another Layer 2 blockchain connected to Ethereum.The Worldchain launch may happen sometime in the summer of 2024. The blockchain will have social media aspects, and will give precedence of verified humans over bots. Worldchain will also be part of the Optimism Superchain ecosystem, meaning all users will be within a few steps of using all current Web3 and DeFi features. Worldcoin Brings Web3 Identity with Controversial AdDid Worldcoin find Leo Messi to take part in their new online ad? Yes and no, but Worldcoin certainly caught the attention of social media with its recent self-promotion. Worldcoin aims to present its identity-based technology in a user-friendly way, as it dispels the controversy of handling sensitive biological data. The creation of an ID is a two-step process, where the creation of a wallet is only one step. The Orb, an iris camera, is also needed to generate a verified account. With biometric data, Worldcoin aims to become one of the blockchains to make a serious attempt to block bots. The Worldcoin campaign is going global and just released a new ad for the Mexico campaign to verify users. Worldcoin Still Holds Off Token UnlocksWorldcoin is distributing its main asset, WLD, in several stages. In recent years, WLD underwent a migration as users increasingly moved to Optimism. Worldcoin went through some problems with its app and displaying the proper token balances. But at this stage, the market operates with only a fraction of the token supply. Less than 5% of all Worldcoin has been minted and released. In the medium term, after 2025, WLD will expand its supply faster, starting with a series of token unlocks. Community tokens will start unlocking at a faster rate after July 2024. Additionally, the Worldcoin team holds around 170M tokens as a reserve. WLD will be distributed mostly to the public, and investor tokens will not have an advantage over unlocked community tokens. Web3 ID Project Targets DevelopersWorldcoin is trying to secure users, but also developer talent. In May, the project opened its campaign to target Web3 and blockchain developers. Developers can now apply to the Wave 1 Community Grant program, open for submissions until May 24. Worldcoin wants to help important projects that have skilled teams and have made progress in their development. Only KYC-verified projects will be eligible for the final grant.

Hermetica Labs launches USDh, the first Bitcoin-native synthetic USD - Crypto Briefing




Hermetica Labs, a decentralized finance protocol built on top of Bitcoin, has launched USDh, the first-ever Bitcoin-native synthetic US dollar. The new offering allows users to gain yields of up to 25% with zero exposure to traditional finance.The new synthetic dollar is designed to increase liquidity and utility to the decentralized finance ecosystem formed around Bitcoin through L1 and L2 protocols. According to Hermetica CEO Jakob Schillinger, USDh will enable Bitcoiners to hold and earn yield on their dollar value while remaining fully backed by Bitcoin.“USDh is a groundbreaking synthetic dollar fully backed by Bitcoin and outside the fiat system. No banks, no fiat, just Bitcoin,” Hermetica Labs said on X.The launch of USDh follows the introduction of Ethena’s USDe in March, which offered a 27.6% yield and raised concerns about the protocol’s long-term sustainability. Similar questions may arise regarding Hermetica’s 25% annual percentage yield (APY), which significantly exceeds the ill-fated Anchor Protocol’s 20% yield on TerraUSD (UST) before its collapse in May 2022.Notably, Fantom founder Andre Cronje has spoken out on this trend, criticizing negative funding rates and non-collateralized stablecoins.On this same subject, Schillinger asserts that USDh’s yield, derived from Bitcoin futures funding rates, is sustainable due to the structural demand for long leverage in Bitcoin futures markets. Backtest data (as gathered by Hermetica Labs) from January 2021 to March 2024 shows an average APY (annual percentage yield) of 11.71%, with an annual return of 26.11% during the 2022 bull market.The introduction of Ordinals has been a significant catalyst for the growth of Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi), Schillinger claims. He believes that BTCFi will match and eclipse the size of Ethereum DeFi within the next five years, citing instances where Ordinals trading volumes have surpassed those of Ethereum and Solana NFTs combined.

Bitcoin Struggles to Break $60,000 Barrier Amid Strong Technical Resistance



                    

Bitcoin is currently struggling to surpass the $60,000 mark, facing significant resistance that is hindering its price rebound, despite recovering up to 6.2% from the week’s lows. 



Analysis from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView highlights that BTC/USD has yet to breach crucial trendlines.




The cryptocurrency has seen a 23% decline from its peak, with recovery prospects appearing slim through April and May. 



Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes has predicted that Bitcoin will continue to trade within a range below $70,000 until August, emphasizing the importance of first reclaiming the $60,000 level. 



However, this mark remains well-defended by existing trendlines.




Particularly challenging for Bitcoin is its 100-day moving average (MA), which, as of May 3, stands at $59,930. 



Historically, this trendline has supported the market since October 2023 and helped sustain prices during the early 2023 bull market phase.

Yet, recent patterns show Bitcoin closing full daily candles beneath this average, indicating a downward shift.




Material Indicators, a trading resource, observed that this average is presenting strong technical resistance. 



They noted, “Reclaiming the 100-Day Moving Average would be a big deal for Bitcoin Bulls that could lead to a short squeeze,” as stated by co-founder Keith Alan on the social platform X.



Another significant obstacle is the short-term holder realized price (STH-RP), which reflects the average cost basis for Bitcoin holders who have held their positions for 155 days or less. 



This metric has repeatedly acted as a robust support during recent weeks and throughout much of the bull market since early 2023. 



As of May 1, STH-RP was recorded at $59,684, closely aligning with the critical $60,000 resistance zone.



Caleb Franzen, CEO of Cubic Analysts, also pointed out the significance of this resistance level in his commentary on X. 



He mentioned that for a ‘risk-on’ scenario, a daily closure above $61,000 is crucial. 



“Lots of work to do,” he concluded, underscoring the challenges that lie ahead for Bitcoin to regain its upward momentum.

Shares of several Bitcoin  mining stocks including Marathon Digital Holdings Inc MARA, Riot Platforms Inc RIOT and CleanSpark Inc CLSK are rising Monday amid strength in the price of Bitcoin. Here’s a look at what you need to know.What To Know: Bitcoin mining stocks rallied alongside bitcoin and the broader crypto space at the start of the year as several spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved for trading, sparking increased demand for the world’s largest crypto. Following bitcoin ETF approval, investors turned their attention to last month’s halving event. The halving is a programmed process in the bitcoin protocol that occurs every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years. Last month, the bitcoin network completed its fourth halving event, marking a significant reduction in the amount of rewards miners receive for successfully mining transactions. Miner rewards were reduced from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin.Mining stocks saw increased volatility leading up to the halving and have continued to be volatile since. It's worth noting that crypto markets have historically rallied in the months following a halving event.Following several days of net outflows, spot bitcoin ETFs reversed the trend last week and saw net inflows of approximately $378 million on Friday as bitcoin bounced off of recent lows and began moving higher. Marathon Digital engages in mining digital assets and focuses on the Bitcoin ecosystem. The stock was up 4.74% at $18.35 at publication time. Riot Blockchain is focused on building, supporting and operating blockchain technologies with a vision to become the leading Bitcoin-driven infrastructure platform. Shares were up 1.92% at $10.60 Monday morning.CleanSpark is an energy company that transitioned its expertise to focus on Bitcoin mining in 2020.

Bernstein's Bitcoin Price Prediction of $150K Reaffirmed by Analysts


																Analysts at investment research firm Bernstein have reaffirmed their prediction that bitcoin (BTC) would hit $150,000 in this bull cycle despite the asset’s retracement in recent weeks.
According to a recent report, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra said Bitcoin metrics show the network is in a healthy cycle still in its early stages. Notwithstanding the latest dip, the leading cryptocurrency is far from done.
Bernstein Reiterates BTC $150K Prediction
Bernstein first predicted that BTC would rally to $150,000 next year in November 2023 due to optimism surrounding the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the U.S. Now, the ETFs have been greenlit, BTC has hit $73,700 and fallen to $60,000, but the firm is not deterred in its prediction.
In the past few weeks, bitcoin has witnessed significant declines attributed to market participants taking profit and escalated tensions between Iran and Israel. Last week, the bears took the reins and pulled the leading digital asset below $57,000, wiping over $200 billion from the crypto market. Although the asset recovered slightly over the weekend and was trading at $64,000 at the time of writing, it may experience further correction in the short term.
Chhugani and Sapra opined that bitcoin’s recent slump wiped out the excess leverage on futures contracts on crypto exchanges. Their belief aligns with that of Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, who stated two weeks ago that the liquidation of leveraged positions created a more favorable environment and cleared a pathway for the crypto market to trend higher.




“We feel even better about that call, and Bitcoin metrics indicate a healthy cycle that is still in its early stages. Risk-reward here remains attractive,” Chhugani and Sapra said.
ETF Inflows Are Encouraging
Furthermore, the Bernstein analysts cited flows into the spot ETFs as an encouraging factor alongside healthy post-halving transaction fees, steady post-halving hash rate, lower prices for bitcoin mining equipment, and more BTC purchases by corporate treasuries.
On Friday, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs broke a seven-day outflow streak and recorded over $378 million in inflows. Grayscale’s GBTC, which had seen outflows since its launch, witnessed inflows for the first time, receiving $63 million from investors. Chhugani and Sapra said GBTC’s inflow was a significant improvement in the market because the other nine ETFs have absorbed the fund’s outflows since launch.

Robinhood Crypto Receives SEC Wells Notice: Fighting for Regulatory Clarity | Cryptoglobe


                                
Robinhood Markets, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOOD) has announced that its subsidiary, Robinhood Crypto (RHC), has received a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff. This notice indicates that the SEC is considering recommending an enforcement action against RHC. Robinhood, a prominent player in the financial technology space, has expressed disappointment in the SEC’s decision, emphasizing its long-standing efforts to work collaboratively with the agency to achieve regulatory clarity in the crypto industry.



Dan Gallagher, Chief Legal, Compliance and Corporate Affairs Officer at Robinhood Markets, Inc., highlighted the company’s good faith attempts to engage with the SEC over the years. Robinhood has been proactive in seeking regulatory guidance, including its well-publicized effort to “come in and register” with the SEC. Despite these efforts, the agency’s issuance of a Wells Notice has left Robinhood disappointed and determined to defend its position.



Robinhood Crypto has consistently maintained that the assets listed on its platform do not constitute securities. The company says it has has made tough decisions to refrain from listing certain tokens or offering products such as lending and staking, which the SEC has previously alleged to be securities in actions against other platforms. It also claims that its cautious approach demonstrates its commitment to operating within the boundaries of the law while advocating for clearer regulations in the crypto space.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

In a show of good faith, Robinhood says, it heeded the SEC’s calls and attempted to register a special purpose broker-dealer with the agency.



Despite the potential enforcement action, Robinhood remains confident in its stance and is prepared to engage with the SEC to present a strong case. The company believes that the facts and the law are on its side, and it is determined to demonstrate the weakness of any case against Robinhood Crypto.



Robinhood has reassured its customers that this development will not impact their accounts or the services provided by the platform. The company also mentions that it remains committed to its mission of democratizing finance and empowering individuals to take control of their financial futures.



here are a couple of reactions for the crypto community:

Runes and BRC-20s are just a stepping stone for Bitcoin DeFi

Bitcoin Runes and BRC-20 tokens may only be a stepping stone in the evolution of Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (DeFi).The emergence of Runes and Bitcoin DeFi came from a desire to add more utility to the world’s safest blockchain network, according to Rich Rines, a Core DAO contributor building Bitcoin DeFi solutions. Rines told Cointelegraph:“[Bitcoin] started as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system then morphed more into a store value and now protects $1.5 trillion of wealth. We’ve seen over the last one and a half years this desire to add more utility to the underlying Bitcoin through the rise of Ordinals, token protocols like BRC 20s and now Runes.”Runes is a new protocol for issuing fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network that launched on April 20, the day of the Bitcoin halving. Runes are part of a wider developer movement known as Bitcoin DeFi, or BTCFi, aiming to add more utility to the Bitcoin network.While Runes created widespread excitement among Bitcoin holders, the token standard may only be a stepping stone in the evolution of BTCFi due to the decentralized nature of the network, according to Rines:“Hard to say if [Runes] remains the standard since Bitcoin is so decentralized. We will have to get to some sort of social consensus on some of the standards that win. Market demand and people voting with their dollars will ultimately be what helps coalesce on the final answer.”Bitcoin Runes made a recovery this week. On April 20, Runes-related transactions accounted for the majority of Bitcoin transactions, or 81.3% of daily BTC transactions, according to Dune Analytics Data.Share of transactions over the Bitcoin network. Source: DuneRelated: Robinhood crypto business slapped with SEC Wells NoticeBitcoin is becoming a yield-generating asset for the first timeAiming to bolster BTCFi innovation, Core Chain launched the first noncustodial Bitcoin (BTC) staking product on April 23, enabling Bitcoin staking without compromising the security of the Bitcoin network.Since noncustodial staking doesn’t require the underlying asset to leave a user’s wallet, it introduces a risk-free yield opportunity for Bitcoin holders, according to Rines:“That’s where the noncustodial Bitcoin staking shines, where you take no risk. It’s totally trustless, Bitcoin becomes a yield-producing asset for the first time with those rewards that you can invest it in more Bitcoin, creating a reflexive loop.”Other protocols are also working on creating more utility for Bitcoin. On May 6, Hermetica announced the launch of the first-ever Bitcoin-backed synthetic United States dollar with yield-generating capabilities.Slated for release in June, USDh will offer yields of up to 25%, aiming to play a pivotal role in bringing more liquidity and use cases to BTCFi.Related: Runes are offering a significant lifeline for Bitcoin miners — TeraWulf COO

Ripple vs. SEC: Reply Brief Due May 6 as Climax Builds


							

The SEC is preparing to submit its reply brief on May 6, following Ripple’s recent filing on April 22.



Ripple countered the SEC’s allegations in its brief.



The SEC’s reply brief will respond to Ripple’s arguments.




Ripple Labs Inc.’s ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is approaching another significant point in its proceedings. Following Ripple’s brief on April 22, the SEC is set to submit its reply brief on May 6 as the climax builds toward final judgment.



After the SEC’s opening brief on March 22, Ripple was granted an extended deadline until April 22 to submit its opposition brief. This allowed Ripple to work on its defense and address the SEC’s allegations to reduce the potential penalty. Ripple’s filing countered expert testimony and other exhibits in the SEC’s opening brief.



However, the SEC’s imminent reply brief will respond to Ripple’s arguments and reinforce its position on the appropriate penalties for the alleged securities violations.



XRP market participant Ashley Prosper recently commented on the upcoming legal phase on X, noting, “Tomorrow we see the final reply from the SEC in the remedies phase of the #Ripple lawsuit. After that, we wait until July or August, maybe even September, for Judge Torres’s final ruling.”



He further speculated the possibility of appeals from either party following the ruling, suggesting that the duration of such requests may be shorter than anticipated. Moreover, Prosper opined that settlement could occur before or during the appellate process.



According to the ongoing case, Ripple sold $770 million worth of XRP to institutional clients. However, market experts have put out different figures regarding Ripple’s potential fine. For instance, legal expert John Deaton insisted that the SEC may be unable to exact the full $770 million from Ripple. On the other hand, crypto analyst Zach Rector has suggested a higher figure of up to $3 billion.



At the conclusion of the briefing phase, the court will deliberate on the arguments presented, after which a verdict will be pronounced. Should Ripple be liable, the verdict will also specify the financial penalty.

The SEC targets Robinhood's crypto business

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has fired a legal shot at Robinhood’s growing crypto business, issuing a Wells notice to the popular trading platform. 
This move signals a significant escalation in regulatory oversight of Robinhood’s cryptographic operations, which could culminate in a legal case that could redefine the landscape of digital asset trading in the United States.

SEC’s move towards Robinhood’s crypto activity
Robinhood, known for its commission-free stock trading and user-friendly interface, has expanded into the cryptocurrency market amid the growing popularity of digital assets. By offering trading services for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, the platform has quickly attracted a considerable user base eager to capitalize on volatile, but potentially profitable, crypto markets.
However, Robinhood’s adventure in the world of cryptocurrencies has not been without controversy. The platform has faced criticism and legal challenges for its handling of crypto transactions, including accusations of market manipulation and inadequate customer support during periods of extreme market volatility.
Now, the SEC’s decision to issue a Wells notice to Robinhood indicates that the regulatory agency has serious doubts about the company’s business practices in the crypto sector. A Wells notice is a formal notification from the SEC that it intends to take legal action against a company or individual, giving the recipient the opportunity to respond before any legal proceedings begin.
The specific allegations against Robinhood remain undisclosed, but likely revolve around regulatory compliance, investor protection, and transparency issues within its cryptocurrency trading operations. The SEC’s move underscores the increasing regulatory scrutiny facing cryptocurrency platforms as regulators seek to establish clearer guidelines and safeguards in an industry known for its wild fluctuations and susceptibility to abuse.
A key area of concern for regulators is the lack of supervision and regulation in the crypto market compared to traditional financial markets. While securities trading is heavily regulated to protect investors and ensure market integrity, the crypto space operates in a largely decentralized and unregulated manner, leaving investors vulnerable to fraud, manipulation, and other risks.
Robinhood’s activity
Robinhood’s cryptographic activity, like other platforms operating in the space, has navigated this regulatory gray area, often facing criticism for its perceived lack of transparency and accountability. The SEC’s action against Robinhood’s crypto activity could serve as a case that sets a clear precedent clarifying the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency trading platforms and establishing clearer guidelines for their operations.
The outcome of the potential SEC lawsuit against Robinhood’s crypto activity could have far-reaching implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Depending on the nature of the charges and subsequent legal proceedings, the case could result in increased regulatory oversight, stricter compliance requirements, and greater investor protections for cryptocurrency traders.
Furthermore, the SEC’s oversight of Robinhood’s crypto activity highlights the growing convergence between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem. With digital assets continuing to gain acceptance and mainstream adoption, regulatory authorities are increasingly focusing their attention on ensuring that these emerging markets operate within established legal frameworks and comply with regulatory standards.
In response to the SEC’s Wells notice, Robinhood has promised to fully cooperate with the regulatory agency and address any concerns raised during the investigation. The company has emphasized its commitment to compliance and regulatory adherence, stating that it takes its responsibilities to customers and the broader market seriously.
However, the outcome of the SEC investigation into Robinhood’s crypto activities remains uncertain and the possible repercussions for the company and the broader crypto industry have yet to be determined. Depending on the results of the investigation and subsequent legal proceedings, Robinhood could face heavy fines, regulatory sanctions, or other penalties that could impact its business operations and reputation.
Conclusions
Regardless of the final outcome, the SEC’s actions against Robinhood send a clear message to the crypto industry that regulatory compliance is non-negotiable. 
As digital assets continue to shape the financial landscape, regulators are stepping up their efforts to ensure that companies operating in this space adhere to the same standards of transparency, integrity, and investor protection that govern traditional financial markets.
In conclusion, the SEC’s decision to file a lawsuit against Robinhood’s crypto activity marks a significant development in the ongoing regulatory saga involving digital assets. 
As the crypto industry matures and attracts more attention from regulators, companies like Robinhood will have to navigate a complex regulatory landscape balancing innovation with compliance. The outcome of this legal battle could have profound implications for the future of crypto regulation and market structure in the United States and beyond.

Crypto.com Hits 100M Users: How It Stacks Up Against Rivals - DailyCoin


        
Crypto.com reached a 100 million user milestone.



This ranks Crypto.com among the biggest exchanges based on this metric.



The exchange’s name recognition is a factor in its success.
Crypto.com has been on a roll lately, with a string of positive developments propelling the cryptocurrency exchange higher. From securing operational approval in the UAE to launching a new promotional campaign featuring rapper Eminem, the platform has made strides in expanding its global footprint.In continuation of this “uptrend,” Crypto.com recently announced that it will achieve 100 million global users, but how does this user count compare to its rival exchanges?Crypto.com’s achievement of reaching 100 million global users is a significant milestone for the Singapore-based company. However, Crypto.com operates within a highly competitive industry, triggering thoughts on how the company stacks up against rival exchanges.It’s no surprise that Binance remains the largest, with CEO Richard Teng revealing that the platform had surpassed 170 million users globally at the end of 2023. Information on Coinbase’s user count varies wildly, with reports citing figures ranging from around 56 million users as of August 2023 to as high as 108 million in 2022.
Other major exchanges like OKX claimed to have around 50 million users, while Kraken stated that their user base is around 10 million. This data would place Crypto.com either as the second or third biggest exchange by global user count out of this group, depending on which Coinbase figure is treated as accurate.Coinbase’s latest 10-Q filing for Q1 2024 does not provide a definitive global user number. However, the company disclosed that its monthly transacting users currently stand at 8 million, down from 8.4 million a year ago.
This reminds us that while global users may make attention-grabbing headlines, the number of individuals regularly using an exchange’s products and services is a more precise measure of user appeal. Name RecognitionChoosing to focus on global user count instead, Crypto.com chief marketing officer Steven Kalifowitz said achieving the 100 million global user milestone was possible thanks to building the company with a sharp focus on compliance, security, and user safety from the start. Kalifowitz also credited Crypto.com’s brand recognition from high-profile partnerships, including the Crypto.com Arena and F1 sponsorship.Having begun as a small startup during the 2018 bear market cycle, CEO Kris Marszalek emphasized the company’s “unshakeable belief that crypto is important.” Marszalek believes this conviction was a significant factor in driving the company toward achieving its milestone global user count.On the Flipside
In June 2023, Crypto.com ended its US institutional business, citing a lack of demand.



An unmentioned factor in Crypto.com‘s success was the previously offered membership rewards, including Netflix and Spotify rebates and significant card cashback. 



These generous rewards were cut two years ago during the last bear phase, leading to major pushback from users.
Why This MattersCrypto.com’s 100 million user milestone positions it as a significant player in the crypto exchange arena. Moreover, the company’s success in attracting more users points to broader crypto adoption trends, which is a net positive for the entire industry.Despite Crypto.com’s regulatory in-roads, South Korean authorities launch an investigation.Crypto.com Postpones South Korea Launch Amid Regulatory ProbeTether plans to take on Google in smartphone showdown.Tether’s “Pear Phone” to Battle Google as Tech Giant Struggles

Dark Bling: Heir To Jewelry Giant Cartier Indicted In Cocaine And Crypto Scandal


								Maximilien de Hoop Cartier, heir to the famed jewelry dynasty, was arrested by US authorities for allegedly laundering millions of dollars for a Colombian drug cartel. Cartier, who primarily resides in France but holds Argentine citizenship, now faces a slew of charges related to money laundering and unlicensed money transmission.

A Family Name Tarnished
Cartier, a direct descendant of Louis Cartier, founder of the iconic luxury brand, appears to have strayed far from the family’s reputable business. Prosecutors allege he conspired with a Colombian drug cartel, attempting to launder hundreds of millions of dollars in drug proceeds. Their scheme reportedly involved converting the illicit funds into Tether (USDT), a controversial cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar.
Over-The-Counter Opulence: USDT And Shell Companies
According to the indictment, Cartier and his associates, including five Colombian nationals, primarily used over-the-counter (OTC) USDT trades to launder the money. OTC transactions bypass traditional exchanges, potentially offering a cloak of anonymity for illicit activities.
The group allegedly set up shell companies disguised as software and technology businesses to further mask their transactions. These shell companies then used their accounts to move the laundered funds in USDT, US dollars, Colombian pesos, and potentially other currencies.

Total crypto market cap currently at $2.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView
USDT’s Allure For The Underworld
The indictment specifically highlights the features of USDT that may have made it attractive for this alleged money laundering operation. USDT boasts near-instantaneous settlements and operates outside the purview of traditional banking regulations.

This lack of oversight could be appealing to criminal organizations accustomed to the risks associated with bulk cash movement or unreliable wire transfers. While Tether, the company behind USDT, claims to be taking steps to curb illicit activity on its platform, the Cartier case raises questions about the effectiveness of these measures.
Cartier Faces Four Counts Of Criminal Misconduct
Currently detained in Miami, Cartier awaits trial on four separate charges. These include money laundering, conspiracy to commit money laundering, transacting in property derived from illegal activity, and operating as an unlicensed money transmitter. If convicted, Cartier could face significant prison time and hefty fines. His co-conspirators are reportedly being held in Colombian jails.
A Shadow Over Cryptocurrencies
The Cartier case serves as a stark reminder of the potential for cryptocurrencies to be misused for criminal purposes. While cryptocurrencies offer legitimate financial benefits, their anonymity and decentralized nature can attract those seeking to operate outside the law.
This incident is likely to reignite discussions about stricter regulations for the cryptocurrency industry, with a focus on combating money laundering and other illicit activities.

Famous Economist Says These Two Events Will Start the Rise in Bitcoin, Announces the Surprise Altcoin He Expects a Big Rally! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bitcoin, which started the new week positively and rose above $65,000, fell to $63,000 after the SEC sent a Wells Notice to the US-based cryptocurrency platform Robinhood.

While volatile movements in Bitcoin continue, a new post came from the famous economist Henrik Zeberg.


Stating that a correction would be healthy after BTC reached its ATH above $ 73,000 and predicting the decline, Henrik Zeberg explained the factors that will ignite the rise in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
At this point, he said that low bond yields and the weakening dollar index (DXY) against foreign currencies will create a “great environment” for risk assets such as Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and start the rise.





Apart from his Bitcoin and crypto market comments, he stated that he expected a big rally in the altcoin named JASMY.
Stating that MACD and RSI indicators point to an increase for JASMY, the famous name pointed out that 400-500% increases have been seen in JASMY in similar situations before.



“Bullish Crossover on MACD, RSI breaks downtrend
We've seen this before….. right before the 400-500% rally.
I expect this move to be BIGGER!”

JASMY continues to trade at $0.0195 at the time of writing.

Crypto.com reaches over 100 million global users


On May 6, 2024, Crypto.com, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, announced surpassing the 100 million worldwide user mark. 
This marks a pivotal moment for the company, founded back in 2016, which has consistently been one of the leaders in the space when it comes to regulatory compliance, security, and privacy.
The achievement comes hot on the heels of Crypto.com’s latest brand film, “INEVITABLE,” under the theme of Fortune Favors the Brave. Interestingly, Crypto.com’s user base has been on a steady rise since the adrenaline-fueled Formula 1 Crypto.com Miami Grand Prix in May 2022, as per the latest information shared by the exchange with Finbold.com.


CEO of Crypto.com, Kris Marszlek noted:

“Positioning our brand through engaging campaigns and iconic partnerships has made Crypto.com a household name.”

Marszlek added.

“But I’m most proud of the fact that we’ve surpassed the 100 million user milestone while building the most widely regulated platform in the industry by leading in global licenses and registrations. There were no shortcuts to this milestone. It was a team effort and we will keep building for the next 100 million users.”



Interestingly, back in November 2022, the exchange hit 70 million users since then, Crypto.com has grown into one of the world’s most recognised brands by collaborating with famous people, places, and events, such as hosting the NBA and NHL Playoffs in the $700 million renamed Crypto.com Arena and the Formula 1 Crypto.com Miami Grand Prix.
The newest Fortune Favors the Brave campaign was launched on social media by Crypto.com and Eminem on Friday, April 26, and debuted on broadcast television during the Los Angeles Lakers NBA Playoff game in the Crypto.com Arena on Saturday, April 27.

MetaMask introduces Smart Transactions to address MEV front-running - Crypto Briefing




MetaMask has launched a new “Smart Transactions” feature to help users address the negative effects of front-running on the Ethereum network.The feature allows users to submit transactions to a “virtual mempool” before they are finalized on-chain. This virtual mempool will protect against certain MEV strategies and run simulations to help users obtain lower transaction fees.MEV (maximal extractable value) refers to the excess value that blockchain operators can extract by previewing or reordering transactions. MEVs have a significant impact on Ethereum’s operations, given how it can lead to higher prices for users, slower transaction speeds, and even failed transactions under specific network conditions.Jason Linehan, director of Consensys’ Special Mechanisms Group, estimates that around $400 million is wasted annually on reverting transactions, stuck transactions, as well as predatory MEV practices.“From a user experience perspective, the idea that you pay for a transaction that does nothing, that’s, like, nonsensical,” Linehan said in an exclusive interview which first appeared on CoinDesk. MetaMask’s virtual mempool solution is similar to private mempools, which operate to ensure transaction privacy and protect against MEV. Consensys, the firm backing MetaMask’s development, claims that the new virtual mempool is different and necessary to address Ethereum’s substantial hidden costs.A key difference here is how private mempool services often ignore fundamental values in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as exposing transactions with third-party risks to decentralization.The Smart Transactions feature leverages builders and searchers, the same operators that power Ethereum’s public mempool, to run its virtual mempool. Unlike the public mempool, builders and searchers in the virtual mempool will face financial penalties if they fail to execute transactions at the prices quoted by MetaMask to users.Linehan claims that 95% of Ethereum’s current builders and searchers have already opted into MetaMask’s virtual mempool program.In addition to ensuring better prices for users, the Smart Transactions feature will also make it easier for users to track their transactions’ progress directly within MetaMask, eliminating the need to visit separate block explorers or tracking websites.

Data Scientist Affirms Meme Coins Won’t Make You Rich


The cryptocurrency market has shifted dramatically since the bull market of 2020-2021, which saw significant gains for popular meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and FLOKI.
Crypto Koryo, a data scientist with extensive experience in the field, explains how the meme coin market has evolved, leading to a scenario where investing in these assets is now considered high risk with potentially low rewards.
Are Meme Coins Worth Investing In? 
In the past, meme coins benefited from a massive influx of retail investment and limited competition. However, the barrier to creating new coins has lowered substantially, leading to a saturated market. 

“Back then, deploying an ERC-20 token wasn’t something the average Joe could easily do. But today, anybody can do it,” Koryo states.

The data backs up his claims. Last month, 138 new meme coins were registered on CoinMarketCap, compared to just 18 in April 2023. This influx has diluted the potential returns for individual these altcoins. Additionally, competition has spread across various blockchain platforms, with even Bitcoin now hosting meme-based tokens.

Investing in these coins involves navigating a volatile market with many choices. Koryo advises that an investor’s portfolio could plummet to zero without substantial diversification. 


“Considering the vast majority of these new meme coins will go to $0, you need a lot of diversification if you want to play that game. If there is too little diversification, your portfolio could go to $0 anytime. Too much diversification, and even a 20x on one of them, wouldn’t impact the PnL by much,” Koryo explains.

Furthermore, the shift from a developer-driven to a retail-driven market means that supply and demand dynamics have fundamentally changed. In 2021, demand significantly outstripped supply, but now, the situation has reversed, creating a market where supply overwhelms demand.

VIDEO

The sobering reality is that while they can still offer substantial returns, the chances of success are much lower, and the risks are considerably higher. For most casual investors, the complexities and efforts required to stay profitable are daunting. Koryo concludes, 

“Undoubtedly, among the thousands of meme coins launching each year, few will print good numbers. The question is: How does it compare to holding Bitcoin or some bluechip?” Koryo concluded.

As investors navigate this challenging market, these coins should be approached cautiously and consider whether the high risk is worth the potential low reward.

Is This the Biggest Address Poisoning Heist? User Claims $71M wBTC Loss with New Ethereum Scam | Cryptopolitan

The past few months of 2024 looked like the calm before the storm, with much fewer rug pulls, scams and bridge exploits compared to previous periods. A new way to divert funds is making the rounds and is affecting bigger wallets.The exploit became known as address poisoning. It involves sending funds to malicious wallets instead of the targeted destination. The attack affects DeFi users and decentralized traders. Biggest Heist Affects Wrapped BTC on the Ethereum BlockchainThe most recent heist affected a sum estimated between $68M and $71M due to fluctuating market prices. The most serious danger of address poisoning is that all involved addresses are entirely valid and usable. Most likely, an attacker injects the exploit address into a user’s history using microtransactions.Then, the user may copy-paste the Ethereum address without checking, thinking it is the address of an exchange or another wallet. Ultimately, the exploit relies on human error and failure to check a few sub-strings of the address. Supporters of human-readable identities also noted that ENS names could save the hassle of comparing address strings. But even comparing the first and last four address letters is sometimes not enough against sending funds to the wrong destination. The current exploit did not even include attacks against the copy-paste function but relied on overlooking the address injected into the wallet’s history. Another form of poisoned address attack is more advanced and involves a compromised wallet that generates private keys already known to the creator.Impersonators Run with the Latest Big ScamThe latest large-scale attack has been used by multiple social media personas, who seem to impersonate the real victim. The wallet’s owner has not come forward in a reliable way, and many claim to be the actual owner, as a way to shill their tokens or NFT. Researcher @Zachxbt remains skeptical, while watching out for new scammers: The high-profile exploit has been used once again for fake giveaways, NFT airdrops or simply to gain exposure for a donation address.Can Funds be Saved from Tainted Addresses?Not all blockchain transactions are irreversible. Currently, the wallet owner has reached out to the hackers, offering a 10% commission if they return the funds. Depending on the protocol, wrapped BTC may also be eligible for a return on the side of block validators. At present, there is no evidence of fund relocation. Is the Address Poisoning Hack a Serial Offense?Some skeptics see the recent heist as a tool for engagement farming or social media clout. There is still not enough evidence to trace the wallet to its owner, though some claim to be the affected account. What is more curious, the funds from the exploit ended up in a wallet cluster that is tied to previous token thefts. Tokens and assets on the Ethereum blockchain remain highly transparent, so this wallet cluster has been singled out for “fake phishing”. The funds have not been sent to a mixer or a decentralized protocol, or laundered though NFT.Is Dust Phishing Scam Revived? The current exploit also looks like a revival of the “dust phishing” scam, which has been around for more than a year. The approach of this attack is the same – the attackers send small transactions to rich wallets, making them believe the sums are coming from other legitimate addresses. Sometimes, the attacker is allowed to generate an address where even the first and last four digits are similar. The best way to avoid problems is to never copy and paste addresses from the transaction history. Instead, get the address from a reliable source each time. The Ethereum network and its token standard cannot prevent dust transactions, and not all malicious addresses can be flagged.Developers are offering a workaround using wallets that can compare random parts of the address’s digits and letters. This will prevent the problem of only verifying characters at the beginning and the end of an address. Other solutions include a visual representation of the address to avoid having to compare the long, unreadable strings.

Sui Network Clarifies Tokenomics of SUI, Says Coins Locked Within Third-Party Custodians and Cannot Be Moved - The Daily Hodl


								Sui Network is addressing “misleading” posts about its token supply being unfavorable to retail investors.
In a post on the social media platform X, Sui Network says that third-party custodians safeguard locked SUI tokens, and they cannot be moved until they are unlocked according to the project’s token emission schedule.










Sui Network also clarifies that Mysten Labs, the developer behind the project, is not involved with the Sui Foundation’s treasury, community reserve, stake subsidies or any other tokens allocated to investors.
“Sui Foundation is the largest holder of locked tokens, which will be unlocked in accordance with the public emissions schedule. These tokens are used to support builders, advance the Move programming language, increase network security, and grow the ecosystem through initiatives like developer grants, hackathons, bug bounties, academic research, and more.
Staking rewards are already in circulation because they are composed of stake subsidies and network fees. Furthermore, 100% of staking rewards earned by the Sui Foundation are returned to the community, and included in the public emission schedule.”
At time of writing, SUI currently has a max supply of 10 billion with a circulating supply of 2.33 billion. The circulating supply is expected to grow to roughly 3.6 billion over the next year, according to TokenUnlocks.

SUI is trading at $1.13 with a market cap of $2.64 billion and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $11.318 billion.

Cryptocurrency Charity Ban in South Korea Sparks Controversy


							

South Korea’s exclusion of cryptocurrencies in donation laws contrasts with global trends, potentially limiting charitable innovation.



Amended donation legislation reflects South Korea’s push to modernize, embracing stablecoins and blockchain vouchers.



Balancing crypto inclusion with regulatory scrutiny, South Korea aims to curb financial crimes while potentially stifling charitable crypto giving.




South Korea has decided to exclude cryptocurrencies from its amended donation legislation, a move that could impact the country’s charities and donation drives. The Ministry of Public Administration announced that the updated “Donations Act” will allow various new donation methods, such as department store gift vouchers, stocks, and loyalty points from Korean internet giant Naver, but it will not permit the use of crypto assets like Bitcoin.



The decision comes as a surprise, especially considering the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies in South Korea. Globally, over $2 billion has been donated using cryptocurrency as of January 2024, according to reports. However, South Korean charities will not be able to tap into this market due to the exclusion of digital assets from the amended law.



Despite the exclusion of cryptocurrencies, the amended legislation will permit donations in local government-issued, KRW-pegged stablecoins and blockchain-issued gift vouchers. This move aims to modernize the donation process, which was first enacted in 2006 when there were fewer types of payment methods and smartphones were not as prevalent.



The amendments also expand the methods of donation from traditional bank transfers and online methods to include automated response systems, postal services, and logistics services. The Ministry aims to implement these changes starting in July, pending approval from lawmakers.









While South Korea was against taking such a step, it is reported that more than 50% of American charities now accept donations in digital assets, which clearly shows an increased trust in cryptocurrencies in charity. The fact that the cryptocurrencies are not being encompassed by the South Korean donation laws may keep the country’s charities off the blockchain bandwagon.



South Korea is also making efforts to combat cryptocurrency-related crimes and financial fraud. To combat the rise in crypto-related crimes, the government recently announced intentions to elevate its interim crypto crime investigation unit to the status of an official agency.



Furthermore, Crypto.com, a Singapore-based crypto exchange, is encountering regulatory challenges in joining the South Korean market. South Korean officials discovered anti-money laundering (AML) issues in the exchange’s data, prompting an “emergency on-site inspection” to monitor its operations.

Bitcoin recovers to $64,000 as spot Bitcoin ETFs make a comeback

Bitcoin rebounded to $64,000 on Monday morning after experiencing a significant decline last week. The latest surge in Bitcoin price comes amid the resurgence of spot Bitcoin ETFs.Wegovy and Ozempic: Are we ready for weight loss drugs?Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF has finally seen inflows. According to data compiled by Farside, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is the biggest Bitcoin ETF in terms of assets, received $63 million from investors on Friday. This marks the end of daily outflows that had been occurring for almost four months since its conversion to a spot ETF structure in January. As a result, the total inflows on all funds on Friday were $378.3 million.Grayscale failed to receive investment, as its fee was the highest at 1.5% compared to all other spot Bitcoin ETFs. That’s why it launched a spinoff version last month with a lower fee of 0.15%.The bullish sentiment in the crypto market has also increased following strong earnings reports from companies such as Coinbase, Block, and MicroStrategy last week. These companies have benefited from the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrency, as the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies around the world approved Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. In their latest earnings reports, they emphasized their commitment to investing in Bitcoin and developing strategies based on cryptocurrency.The surge in Bitcoin price has lifted other cryptocurrencies as well. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, which was hovering around $2,800 last week, reached above $3,100 in the morning. The price of Solana and Dogecoin spiked 12% each in the past week, trading at $151 and $0.15, respectively.More Bitcoin news The top 5 spot Bitcoin ETFsHow to speak crypto: A glossary of terms Bitcoin reached all-time high of over $73,000 in March

Empire Newsletter: The DOJ's about-face on money transmitters - Blockworks


Take it to court!
Crypto’s long been regarded as the “Wild West” and one of the biggest reasons that the comparison still sticks — despite how far the market has come since Satoshi’s days — is because of the regulation via enforcement approach that some government bodies have taken (looking at you, Gary Gensler).
But now it looks like the Department of Justice is trying to join the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ranks, at least when it comes to unlicensed money transmission. 
The DOJ is alleging, in two separate cases, that wallet developers should be charged with the violation. 
As CoinCenter’s Peter Van Valkenburgh pointed out last week, this approach marks a change for the DOJ. Since roughly 2013, the stance from other arms of the government had been that developers and users of non-custodial wallets weren’t transmitters. 
But it looks like the DOJ has changed its mind, at least in the Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet cases.
Read more from our opinion section: Samourai Wallet matters more than your memecoins
CoinCenter broke down the historical context, highlighting that FinCEN — the Treasury’s financial enforcement bureau — said in 2013 that crypto could be a value “that substitutes for currency” but that it’s not inherently a currency or “funds.”
FinCEN’s 2019 guidance also backed this up. 
“The person participating in the transaction to provide additional validation at the request of the owner does not have total independent control over the value,” the agency wrote at the time.
Van Valkenburgh said the Tornado Cash developers — the DOJ is taking aim at Roman Storm and Roman Semenov in this case — and the Samourai Wallet founders didn’t have “any actual control over the cryptocurrency that users of the tool owned.”
Read more: Tornado Cash arrests spur privacy debate
“Under clear and long established FinCEN guidance and under any common sense reading of the underlying law, these developers are not money transmitters. Nonetheless the prosecution persists unjustly,” he continued.
CoinCenter noted that Samourai Wallet, in particular, didn’t have “total independent control” over funds, which wouldn’t make them money transmitters.
Senator Cynthia Lummis, notoriously pro-crypto, echoed Van Valkenburgh’s concerns.
“This stance contradicts existing Treasury finance, common sense and violates the rule of law,” she said last week.
Here’s the thing: Crypto is dealing with the repercussions of the lack of regulation already. 
Take a look at the Consensys suit against the SEC. I know we’ve talked about this extensively, but the SEC investigating ETH as a security would mark a huge change in how it approaches regulation (though all of this is just alleged at this time). 
The SEC’s public stance has been that ETH — like bitcoin — isn’t a security. Changing its stance would not only pit two agencies against each other (the CFTC has previously claimed it’s a commodity), but it shows just how far we have to go when it comes to regulation in this industry.
The DOJ’s wallet transmitter arguments could set up something similar. 
Read more from our opinion section: Ether is the Schrödinger’s cat of crypto
The Justice Department’s filings further muddy the water, not to mention the public disagreement with the previous policies. For their part, CoinCenter said they’ll continue to watch and “defend both the wrongly accused developers” and previous policies
So grab your popcorn and take a seat. It’s just another day in the land of crypto, I guess.

Crypto VCs invested $2.49 billion in Q1 of this year, according to Galaxy Digital. 
That figure represents a 68% quarter-over-quarter increase.
One more point from Galaxy’s May 3 report: A whopping 80% of that amount went to early-stage firms, meaning VCs spent the period betting on new teams and projects. 
BTC cracked above $65,000 this morning, though it has slid slightly to about $64,400 as of the time of writing. 
A new dashboard co-developed by Visa posits that less than 10% of stablecoin transactions represent “organic payments activity.” 

Ghosts of crypto past
And in other DOJ news…
Even as the crypto industry plows ahead with new trends and tech — looking at you, memecoins and staking — some of the issues of yesteryear keep popping back up.
The DOJ rolled out indictments against a trio of former execs from crypto lender Cred late Friday. 
If you don’t remember Cred, you can perhaps be forgiven. The lender declared bankruptcy in 2020, a move that kicked off a multi-year legal process that saw Cred accuse exchange platform Uphold of essentially orchestrating its downfall. Uphold, as expected, denied the accusation. The bankruptcy process remains ongoing, though a reorganization plan was approved in 2021.
That era saw a raft of crypto lenders go belly-up in the wake of the downfall of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Cred wasn’t among them, but some of that story’s components — a problematic retail-focused lending product, bankruptcy, and court drama — presaged the era of financial turbulence that culminated with FTX’s downfall.
Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried found guilty in landmark crypto trial
Which brings us to the Cred indictments. James Alexander, Joseph Podulka and Daniel Schatt were hit with wire fraud and money laundering charges, with the group accused of “making false and fraudulent statements to customers and investors about Cred’s lending and investing practices” per a DOJ press statement. 
Before the collapse, Cred’s execs presented two realities, the DOJ alleged. Publicly, Cred said everything was fine. But in the background, market volatility, culminating with 2020’s crazy crypto flash crash, pushed the lender into dangerous waters. 
Cred kept driving forward, the DOJ alleged: “Nevertheless, rather than disclose to Cred’s customers and investors the reality of Cred’s finances, defendants allegedly attempted to keep the business afloat by bringing in new customer funds and by discouraging existing customers from seeking and obtaining redemptions from their investments.”
The damage: hundreds of millions of dollars in lost value for customers’ crypto assets. 
The Cred trio face decades in prison. But will their day in court be as flashy or, in a word, historic as the FTX trial? I wouldn’t bet on it.
Still, the move is another highlight in the DOJ’s slow march across the crypto ecosystem. The Binance settlement and four-month jailing of Changpeng Zhao, as well as lawsuits against KuCoin and longtime bitcoin investor Roger Ver, signal that US prosecutors continue to return to crypto’s past in an effort to shape its future. 
Read more: DOJ charges Roger Ver with tax fraud
While the press might not flock to see the US government grill Cred, it’s worth paying attention — what plays out in those hearings and court docs may set important precedent. Stay tuned.

The Works

A16z’s Chris Dixon says there’s a “void” of crypto representatives following the sentencings of CZ and SBF, Bloomberg reports.
Grayscale notched its first inflows since January on Friday after it saw over $17 billion in withdrawals. 
Bitcoin surpassed one billion transactions over the weekend, The Block reports.
Jack Dorsey left the board of decentralized social media platform Bluesky, according to a post from the company.
Bernstein analysts think bitcoin could still hit $150,000 this cycle.

The Morning Riff
Has bitcoin bottomed out?
It doesn’t matter if you’re on Wall Street, in your mom’s basement, or just checking on your wallet, everyone always has the same question after a price dip: Is this the bottom?
Let’s look at bitcoin, which dipped below $60,000 last week and is down roughly 3.7% over the last month. It’s been one hell of a ride for bitcoin so far this year between all-time highs, the halving and, of course, bitcoin ETFs. 
Unfortunately, macro events persist and bitcoin’s shown weakness during previous macro conditions.
But it may not be the overall environment either, because — as we’ve previously reported — analysts expected weakness after the halving. JPMorgan predicted that bitcoin could go as low as $42,000 post-halving, while others are eyeing $50,000. 
Given that bitcoin’s up nearly 3% over the past week, I think it’s fair to say that, even if it has further to fall and I’m gonna leave that analysis to the experts, it looks like there’s still a lot of room for bitcoin to regain its footing.

‘AI-Agents Will Do Crypto Transactions’: Arif Khan on the Future of Crypto-AI

If you can bake ownership into the design structure of what you're building, then you're sort of reversing the power dynamic. And that means, for example, at a very, very basic level, it means if you are a creator, if you own an asset, or if you own aspects of your words — and if you've licensed it out, or it's part of a chain of provenance, you are now part of an equation where for anything that's trained on it, you get some level of compensation down the line. This is very complex to do at scale.

                        Bitfinex’s CTO Paolo Ardoino has dismissed claims by hacking group Fsociety, that allege a breach of the cryptocurrency exchange’s database.Ardoino deemed the claims “fake” and emphasized that no ransom request was made through official channels such as bug bounty programs, customer support tickets, emails, or social media platforms.Bitfinex Clarifies Misinformation Surrounding Alleged Data BreachThe misinformation about Bitfinex’s alleged data breach began circulating on social media on Saturday, apparently triggered by a tweet from Alice of Shinoji Research. Alice claimed that Bitfinex had fallen victim to a large-scale data breach, echoing the assertions of hacking group FSociety on April 26.The tweet, since deleted, gained traction after being picked up by Walter Bloomberg, a prominent breaking news account with a substantial following. Walter Bloomberg tweeted, citing Shinoji Research, that Bitfinex’s data, comprising 2.5 Terabytes of information and personal details of 400,000 users, had been hacked.Alice of Shinoji Research later corrected the record, acknowledging their premature assertion. “Removed the original BFX [Bitfinex] hack post as I’m not able to edit it,” Alice stated.“What appears to have happened is that this ‘Flocker’ group curated a list of Bitfinex logins from other breaches. They then made the site look like a ransom demand for a major breach.”Ardoino clarified that Bitfinex does not store plaintext passwords or 2FA secrets in clear text, further diminishing the credibility of the alleged breach. Out of the purported 22,500 records of emails and passwords leaked by Fsociety, only 5,000 matched with Bitfinex users.Ardoino suggested that the hackers likely gathered data from various other crypto-related data breaches, exploiting the common practice of users utilizing the same login credentials across multiple platforms. Ardoino further stated, “As I said on Saturday, Bitfinex’s user database was not breached. We spent the weekend reviewing all internal data to avoid leaving any stone unturned. We concluded that the claim was fake, as suspected from the beginning.”Bitfinex Refutes Claims of Data Breach by Fsociety
Fsociety, inspired by the fictional hacking group from the television series “Mr. Robot,” asserted on its dark web homepage on April 26 that it had successfully breached several entities, including Bitfinex, Rutgers University, consulting firm SBC Global, and a misspelled reference to Coinmama.Despite Fsoceity’s claims, none of the alleged victims, including Bitfinex, have acknowledged experiencing a significant data breach or engaging in ransom payment. Ardoino highlighted that Bitfinex never received direct communication from the hacking group and questioned the legitimacy of Fsociety’s assertions.Moreover, Ardoino shared insights from a security researcher suggesting that Fsociety’s motive may have fabricated the claim of breaching Bitfinex to promote its ransomware tools—the tool to which it purportedly sells access for a subscription fee and a commission on stolen profits. According to the researcher, such claims generate buzz and serve as advertisements for the tool’s effectiveness, enticing others to purchase it for potential exploitation. Ardoino questioned the rationale behind such actions, wondering if FSOCIETY had successfully breached Bitfinex.Despite the allegations, Ardoino assured users that Bitfinex would diligently investigate the situation. As of now, no breach has been detected, and all user funds remain secure.Bitfinex’s history includes a notable hacking incident in 2016, during which over 95,000 Bitcoins were compromised. Two individuals, including the self-professed crypto rapper Razzlekhan, pleaded guilty to money laundering charges related to the hack and forfeited the stolen bitcoin to authorities.

Bitcoin Address and Crypto ATM Scam Costs Users $70 Million


Cryptocurrency traders are increasingly targeted by sophisticated scams, leading to significant losses. Scammers have pulled off everything from large Bitcoin thefts to tricky crypto ATM schemes. These indicate growing risks in the digital currency market.
As cryptocurrencies become more popular, they also become prime targets for scams. These scams take advantage of the complex nature of crypto transactions.
Victims Lose Over $70 Million in Bitcoin, Crypto Scams
A Bitcoin trader mistakenly sent a whopping $69.3 million to a scam address. This “address poisoning” scam was confirmed by blockchain security firm CertiK. In this scam, criminals make fake crypto addresses. As a result, the trader’s assets on Coinbase crashed by nearly 97%, leaving only $1.6 million in their wallet.
Address poisoning involves scammers sending small sums to real users’ accounts. This tricks them into making errors in future transactions. Since blockchain transactions are public, it’s easier for scammers to pull off these schemes.

Meanwhile, the spike in cryptocurrency-related scams shows no signs of slowing. According to the FBI’s 2023 Internet crime report, these scams drained $3.94 billion from investors, making up most of the year’s investment scam losses.
Cryptocurrency platforms like Trezor advise users to double-check addresses. It conducts test transactions before sending large amounts to fend off such scams.


“The most important step in avoiding this type of scam is to thoroughly verify and double-check the address before confirming the transaction. This is crucial for all transactions, especially when sending assets of significant value. The only way to ensure safety is to carefully check every character of the address,” Trezor wrote.

On another front, the Denver Police Department has warned about a growing scam involving cryptocurrency ATMs. Per the police, scammers masquerading as officials deceived a woman into believing she had missed a court appearance and had a pending arrest warrant. 
Coerced into avoiding alleged jail time, she was instructed to deposit “bail” money using a cryptocurrency option at a self-service banking kiosk. Tragically, she lost $14,000 before realizing it was a scam.
These incidents highlight a growing challenge within the crypto community and beyond — identifying and avoiding scams. Experts stress the importance of vigilance and skepticism, particularly with transactions requiring cryptocurrency, as scammers continually evolve their tactics to exploit unsuspecting victims.

Is It Time For Altcoins To Shine? Expert Predicts Uptick For DOGE As BTC Finds Solid Ground - Benzinga

In a recent forecast, a prominent crypto expert has anticipated a surge in altcoins, with Dogecoin DOGE/USD likely to witness significant gains.What Happened: The crypto expert, known as Rekt Capital, shared his predictions with his 461,000 followers on a social media platform, according to Daily Hodl reported on Monday. He suggested that the OTHERS chart, which tracks the market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding the top 10, is likely gearing up for a rebound off the $250 billion mark.Rekt Capital’s chart points to an initial target of $315 billion, followed by a potential surge to previous peaks near $425 billion. He stated, “Altcoin Market Cap is still holding the $250 billion well as support, positioning itself for a future move to the upside via the black pathway.”See Also: EcoAi Coin: A Sustainable Digital Token For A Greener PlanetSpecifically for Dogecoin, the expert confirmed a macro uptrend after a successful retest of the $0.12 level. The chart indicates that the next major resistance levels are at $0.20 and $0.278.Rekt Capital also shared his views on Bitcoin BTC/USD, suggesting that the crypto king may have already found solid support around the $60,000 level.Why It Matters: Rekt Capital’s predictions follow a similar forecast by crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe, who anticipated a major rally in the altcoin markets amid disappointing U.S. economic data. Van de Poppe suggested that the Federal Reserve’s potential response to the underperforming job market could trigger a rally in risk-on assets.Viktor, a pseudonymous researcher focused on decentralized finance, noted that altcoins have been outperforming Bitcoin during the recent market downturn. Viktor proposed two possible scenarios: altcoins could either witness a significant drop in the next downward move, or they might not have many sellers left relative to Bitcoin due to the April 12-13 liquidation cascades.Price Action: On Monday, DOGE was trading at $0.159 while BTC was trading at $63,564.40 at the time of writing, as per Benzinga Pro.Read Next: ‘Dogecoin Killer’ Shiba Inu Burn Rate Spikes 800% Amid New Margin Pair Listing On KrakenImage via Shutterstock

LUNC Picks Up 13% Despite Trashed Key Terra Classic Proposal - DailyCoin


        
Terra Luna Classic bounced back to mid-April levels in a 13.35% rally.



The governance proposal to set a limit on validator nodes gets dismissed.



Despite slowing down, LUNC burns cut the remaining supply to 5.79T.
Last weekend, Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) rejected a key governance proposal to prevent the chain’s validators from launching multiple validators on the network. Proposal #12101 seeks to impose a single-validator rule, which has been called “un-actionable” and “pointless” by certain validators like SolidVote.While most members agree the proposal to limit validator nodes has good intentions, the strategy would be hard to realize because Terra chain validators can simply ignore the implemented rules. Breaking down the voting results, almost 38% of Terra Classic community members voted ‘Yes’, while 37% voted ‘No’, and another 21% vetoed the proposal.Despite the Terra Luna Classic community being divided into two camps over LUNC chain validator policy, the embattled Layer-1 altcoin inked 8.6% gains to trade at $0.0001162 as of press time. While the validator limit proposal tackles centralization issues due to unlimited validator nodes, a resubmission of the proposal is likely soon.Black Swan Survivor LUNC Surges 13%Coinciding with Terra’s malfunctioning stablecoin Terra Classic USD (USTC) massive 28% spike to $0.0233, LUNC’s price trajectory received a significant boost on May 2, scorching above the $0.0001 confluent support line after dropping below this decisive price range on April 30.
Thanks to Binance’s LUNC burning contributions, the circulating LUNC supply is now heavily reduced, with 5,799,402,152,117 LUNC tokens left in circulation. Binance’s latest monthly burning ceremony saw 1.5B LUNC tokens destroyed, but the effort was significantly smaller than the cumulative burns executed in April.The 140% upswing in Terra Classic’s 24-hour trading volume contributed towards the surge, and LUNC added $100 million to its global market cap since May 2. The milestone was followed by an overbought condition on LUNC’s trading charts, as this indicator points to 75.12. Volatility-wise, the tight Bollinger Bands are gradually widening, implying that LUNC price volatility will likely expand in the coming days.On the Flipside
LUNC hasn’t been able to restore a $1 billion market capitalization since March 15, 2024, then catching up on early Spring’s memecoin season.



TerraForm Labs, the original issuer of Terra Luna coins, went bankrupt earlier this year after the UST crash lawsuit was filed in favor of the SEC.

90% of Ethereum, Tron, Solana Stablecoin Transactions Are ‘Inorgranic Activity’, Visa Says - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsNearly all stablecoin transactions are tied to “inorganic activity,” according to payments giant Visa and enterprise blockchain data provider Allium.The companies have launched a new data dashboard designed “to remove potential distortions that can arise from inorganic activity and other artificial inflationary practices,” and its adjusted figures reveal upwards of 90% of tracked transactions occur without human involvement.The dashboard tracks Tether's eponymous USDT, Circle's USDC, Paxos's USDP, and PayPal's PYUSD. All of them are pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar and keep cash or cash-like (U.S. treasury bonds) reserves to back their tokens. Visa doesn't attribute the "inorganic activity" to any particular stablecoin, but comparing the adjusted and unadjusted figures casts a stark light on just how infrequently humans are the ones initiating stablecoin payments.For example, Visa reports that $51.6 billion worth of stablecoin transactions were processed on Sunday, May 5. That's the unadjusted figure. When the data is adjusted to remove so-called inorganic activity, the number plummets to $4.6 billion.The Visa data analysis was conducted, at least in part, in response to a Coin Metrics chart making the rounds on Twitter claiming that stablecoin were catching up with established settlement networks.In a blog post last week, Visa's head of crypto, Cuy Sheffield, argued that transactions initiated by smart contracts—without any human explicitly involved—aren't directly comparable to the kind of transactions handled by traditional payment processors."For instance, developers can create automated bot programs that perform activities such as stablecoin arbitrage, liquidity provision, and market making, among others," he wrote. "These activities are vital for sustaining the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. However, the on-chain transactions resulting from interactions with these automated programs don't resemble settlement in the traditional sense."Other notable data points emerged from the analysis. According to Visa, USDC usage has experienced marked growth in the past eight months.In September 2023, USDC was used for 23% of all the stablecoin transactions analyzed by Visa. But by the end of the year, that rate of use had more than doubled, surpassing 50% of all stablecoin transactions—as high as 60% in February—every month since December, according to Visa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Summer will offer 'perfect opportunity' for investing in crypto - Arthur Hayes

According to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, the next few months will offer an ideal opportunity to accumulate crypto before the next leg up of the bull market kicks in.  “Those people who have fiat and extra cash that want to allocate to crypto, this is the perfect opportunity to do so,” Hayes told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview, referring to the current rangebound market. According to Hayes, inflationary monetary policies will play the main role in propelling Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market higher later this year. “Major economies around the world are going to print even more money between now and, say, the next 18 to 24 months,” Hayes predicted. According to Hayes, the upcoming United States presidential elections will be a bullish catalyst for crypto, as the country’s financial authorities are incentivized to implement looser monetary policies, possibly to support President Joe Biden’s re-election. In the past, periods of monetary expansion have led to crypto market rallies. “When you control the purse of the government, it’s very easy to do so by printing money, borrowing it, and handing it out to people in various forms,” Hayes explained. To find out more about Hayes’ investment thesis on crypto for the second half of 2024, check out our full interview on our YouTube channel, don’t forget to subscribe!VIDEO

Bitcoin Relative Open Interest Lowest Since Feb, Analyst Says "Hard To Be Bearish"


                            Data shows the Bitcoin Open Interest as a percentage of its market cap has been at lows recently, a sign the derivatives side has been healthy.
Bitcoin Open Interest Is Now Less Than 2% Of The Market Cap
As explained by analyst James Van Straten in a new post on X, the derivatives side of the market has looked “extremely healthy” while BTC’s latest recovery has occurred.
The metric of interest here is the “Open Interest,” which keeps track of the total amount of derivatives-based Bitcoin positions that are currently open on all centralized exchanges.

When the value of this indicator goes up, it means that the investors are opening up more positions on the market right now. Generally, the total leverage in the market rises when such a trend takes place, so the price of the asset could end up turning more volatile following it.
On the other hand, a decline in the metric suggests users are either closing up their positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. The cryptocurrency may behave in a more stable manner following such a decrease.
Now, here here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the past few years:

The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent days | Source: @jvs_btc on X
In the graph, the Open Interest is displayed as a percentage of the asset’s market cap (that is, the total valuation of the entire BTC circulating supply at the current spot price).
It would appear that the indicator has registered a drawdown recently and has slipped under the 2% mark. This would suggest that the positions on the derivatives market now make up for less than 2% of the market cap.
From the chart, it’s visible that the metric had earlier spiked to a high as the coin’s rally towards a new all-time high had taken place. Interestingly, the market cap was rapidly going up in this rally, but this ratio was still trending up, implying that speculation had been growing at a rate faster than the price.
This may have been a sign that the derivatives side was starting to become overheated. In the drawdown that had followed the price top, the investors had started getting liquidated, leading to the ratio registering a decline.

The most recent price drop had helped reset the market further, bringing the ratio down to levels not seen since February. Bitcoin has been mounting a recovery effort in the past few days, but so far, the derivatives market has remained cool. “Hard to be bearish here,” says the analyst.
It now remains to be seen if the health of the market would continue to look optimistic in the coming days, thus potentially allowing for the recovery to go a step further.
BTC Price
Bitcoin had returned back above $65,500 earlier, but the asset has since seen a small pullback as it’s now down to $64,100.

XRP Ledger To Undergo Major Upgrades: What To Expect


								The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is set to undergo a series of substantial enhancements that promise to expand its functionality and market relevance significantly. These proposed upgrades, outlined by renowned community member Krippenreiter via X, cover a broad spectrum from improving interoperability to bolstering the ledger’s decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities.
Detailed Overview Of Proposed XRP Ledger Upgrades
Digital Identity (DID): In its final voting stages, DID introduces a mechanism for users to control their digital identities within the ecosystem. The identity data itself remains off-chain, ensuring privacy and security. This feature supports critical use cases like reusable KYC processes and compliance-focused, permissioned decentralized exchanges, which could streamline regulatory processes and increase institutional adoption.
XChainBridge: Also up for a vote, this feature aims to enhance the ledger’s ability to interface with other blockchains, such as those compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). By enabling asset transfers between XRPL and independent sidechains, XChainBridge would facilitate a seamless exchange of XRP, and potentially other tokenized assets, enhancing the ledger’s utility in a multi-chain ecosystem.
Price Oracles: Currently in the voting phase, this upgrade introduces a native system for integrating off-chain data crucial for the operation of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized exchanges (DEX), and protocols. This could be particularly transformative for automated market makers (AMM), evolving to version 2 with enhanced pricing accuracy and reduced slippage.

PaychanAndEscrowForTokens: Under discussion, this proposal seeks to extend existing functionalities—previously limited to XRP—to include token balances. This would enable the use of payment channels and escrow for token transactions, potentially unlocking new scalability solutions and use cases like token lock-ups and enhanced transaction throughput.
Dynamic NFTs (dNFTs): Still in the draft stage, dNFTs propose a revolutionary shift from static to dynamic non-fungible tokens. These NFTs could incorporate real-time data updates, ideal for applications in digital collectibles that need to reflect live information or virtual gaming items that evolve with player progress.
XRPL Plugins: This draft proposal introduces a system that would allow developers to interact with transactions using programming languages other than the traditional C++. This could democratize the development process, allowing a broader base of developers to build applications directly interacting with the ledger.

Hooks: Another draft feature, Hooks are designed to embed lightweight, non-EVM-based smart contract functions directly into ledger. This could vastly improve the ledger’s flexibility and utility in automated payments and complex transaction scripting, similar to smart contracts but with potentially greater efficiency and lower cost.
Focus On DeFi And Advanced Financial Instruments
Managed Single Asset Tokenized Pool: Currently a proposed feature, this would extend XRPL’s DeFi offerings by introducing pools that are managed by a delegate account, supporting various functions like lending, yield farming, and staking. This could attract a more diverse range of DeFi participants and liquidity providers.
Options: This proposal aims to integrate traditional financial instruments into the XRPL environment. By offering decentralized options trading, the ledger could tap into the vast market of derivatives, providing users with tools for risk management and speculative opportunities within the decentralized space.
Atomic/Batch Transactions: This feature, still under proposal, would allow the bundling of multiple transactions into a single unit, streamlining processes and enhancing user experience. This could facilitate complex operations like batch payments or grouped trade orders, making the ledger more attractive for business applications.
The XRP Ledger is at a pivotal juncture, with the potential to dramatically extend its capabilities and market penetration. The proposed upgrades, spanning from digital identity management to sophisticated DeFi solutions, highlight the community’s commitment to evolving the ledger into a more versatile and user-friendly platform. As these enhancements undergo voting and implementation, the XRP Ledger is on the verge of transformative changes.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.52844.

Why Are Hong Kong Crypto Custodians Clashing With Exchanges?


							

Hong Kong crypto custodians and exchanges disagree on asset custody.



Zodia’s CEO advocates for independent management of client assets.



Only a few exchanges have complied with licensing requirements in Hong Kong.




Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency custodians and exchanges find themselves at odds over the custody of customer assets, sparking a contentious debate within the city’s burgeoning crypto industry.



At the forefront of this dispute is Zodia Custody, a company backed by the British banking giant Standard Chartered. Zodia’s CEO, Kal Chan, has been vocal in advocating for regulatory oversight specifically tailored to cryptocurrency custodians. Chan asserts that the current practice of exchanges managing both their funds and client assets could lead to perceptions of assets commingling, undermining trust in the market.



This sentiment is echoed by Zodia’s desire to work closely with regulators to develop regulations that would allow custodians to manage client assets independently, separate from exchange operations. According to Chan, such a regulatory framework would instill confidence among institutional investors, who prioritize security and transparency when choosing where to store their digital assets.



However, not everyone in the industry shares Chan’s viewpoint. Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at OSL, a licensed Hong Kong-based exchange, argues that the existing regulatory framework already ensures the protection of customer assets. Tiu contends that any perceived duopoly in custody services is a result of market maturity rather than regulatory shortcomings.



OSL, along with Hashkey, another licensed exchange, currently dominates the custody market in Hong Kong. Both companies handle customer funds in addition to operating as exchanges. Tiu emphasizes that these platforms undergo rigorous annual audits to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and safeguard client assets.









Despite the opposing stances, there are signs that regulators may be open to considering changes. Chan hopes for a consultation period later this year, signaling a willingness from regulators to address concerns raised by custodians.



The proliferation of unregulated crypto trading platforms in Hong Kong further complicates the debate over custody regulations. Financial regulators have been urging exchanges to apply for licenses, but only a few have so far complied. This regulatory push indicates the need for clear guidelines regarding custody practices in the cryptocurrency market.

Daily Burn Amount in Ethereum Decreased to the Lowest Level in the Last 4 Months! Here's Why! - Bitcoin Sistemi


The Ethereum network has recently experienced a significant decrease in the amount of ETH burned daily, reaching its lowest level this year. This trend was primarily driven by the recent decline in average gas fees.
Ethereum's Low Gas Fees Push ETH Burn Rate to Lowest Level in Year
Currently, gas fees hover between 5 and 10 gwei, marking one of the lowest levels ever seen. This decrease in network fees directly affected ETH issuance and resulted in less ETH being burned.


On Sunday, the amount of ETH burned was only 610 ETH, marking a record low for this year as Ethereum's gas fees remain minimal.

In comparison, the daily amount of ETH burned during the first four months of this year remained above 2,500-3,000 ETH.





The ongoing decline in gas fees is partly due to the shift of operations to Layer 2 scaling solutions and the increasing adoption of blob transactions.
These were introduced with the Dencun upgrade in March and help reduce transaction costs on Layer 2s.


Gas fees and ETH burning dynamics are a closely watched aspect of the network's economic model. While lower fees are beneficial for network users, the recent decline in ETH burning has an impact on Ethereum's deflationary aspects.

Nostr and X Get a Nod as Jack Dorsey Exits BlueSky

Dorsey, in a post on X on Saturday called upon his followers to use “freedom technology” such as X, and to not depend on corporations “to grant you rights.” He said something very similar on Nostr, the open source protocol aimed at enabling a fully decentralized, censorship-resistant social media experience, where he's been very active in past weeks and to which in 2022 he donated 14 bitcoin (worth about $245,000 at the time) to the protocol's founder.

‘Genius’ AI-crypto project LPs lose $1.3M to ‘fake token’ hack, rug pull suspected | Protos


A fake version of AI-crypto project Genius’ token, GNUS, was used to drain Uniswap liquidity providers of $1.3M on Sunday.
The attack involved creating an identical token on the Fantom blockchain, where no official version of GNUS had yet been deployed.
After cloning the GNUS token contract on Fantom, the attacker bridged 100M freshly minted tokens across to their Ethereum address using the Axelar bridge.
Finally, the GNUS tokens were sold into the existing Uniswap liquidity pool, draining the 407 ETH (worth $1.3M at the time).
The Genius team acknowledged the attack via X (formerly Twitter). The CEO later pointed to a development wallet having being compromised “during a Discord hack”. This apparently “enabled [the hacker] to launch the exact address on FTM of the Axelar Token Minter Manager contract” which allowed the fake tokens to be minted as genuine on Ethereum and Polygon.
The sell-off caused the GNUS price to tank by over 95%, from $22.86 to $0.79, according to data from CoinGecko. 
One security researcher pointed out that the incident is not technically a ‘hack’ of Genius’ smart contracts, as the stolen funds were taken from the Uniswap pool’s liquidity providers (LPs) via a standard swap, as opposed to from the platform itself.
Another researcher suspects the incident to have been a premeditated ‘rug pull’, a way for the team to steal funds from LPs while making out that a hacker is responsible.
The CEO states that a total of $1M will be added back into the liquidity pool to attempt to bolster the GNUS price, “once we are sure it can’t be hacked again.”

Ghost chain
Fantom, once amongst the top contenders for the role of “ETH killer” during last cycle, has since seen its fortunes fade.
Fantom hit its peak in early 2022, when it boasted over $7B of total value locked (TVL). This has since dropped to just $120M, ranking 37th on DeFiLlama’s list of largest blockchains. 
Last year, problems with Multichain, Fantom’s main bridge, further compounded issues. First rumours, then confirmation of the disappearance of Multichain CEO led to depegs of many stablecoins and ‘wrapped’ assets, as the fate of their collateral remained unclear.
The Fantom Foundation has since been pursuing the partial recovery of lost assets via legal action in Singapore, where it was recently granted a default judgement against Multichain.

First and largest Bitcoin Rune is down 85% in a month | Protos


Bitcoin was supposed to gain a new suite of features after its 4/20 Halving date thanks to Casey Rodarmor’s Runes, his new fungible token protocol. User numbers and prices have both dropped rapidly since launch.
It was claimed that Runes would be superior to BRC-20s, STAMPs and various other Bitcoin-branded fungible token protocols because it would require fewer on-chain transactions. 
Rodarmor gained a cult following after his success at applying his take on ordinal theory to Bitcoin. He purposefully created a First In First Out (FIFO) convention to allow Bitcoiners to track imaginary satoshis, the smallest denominations of bitcoin, across transactions. Inadvertently, by coding his Ordinals theory into software, Rodarmor somewhat accidentally created a popular NFT protocol that became a multi-billion dollar marketplace. As speculators lost millions and enriched an elite group of NFT promoters selling Inscriptions to followers, they rallied behind Rodarmor and asked for more.
The masters of trading NFTs-on-satoshis wanted a new project to enable even more types of degenerate trading on Bitcoin. They wanted traditional meme coins like DOGE or PEPE “on” Bitcoin. Rodarmor delivered.

Casey Rodarmor writes fungible token protocol Runes
He even admitted in his founding blog post for Runes that he was simply catering to their desires for scams and memes. “I’m not sure creating a new fungible token protocol for Bitcoin is a good idea. Fungible tokens are 99.9% scams and memes. However, they don’t appear to be going away any time soon.” That, at least, is an honest rationale.
So, Rodarmor created Runes, his better-than-the-rest protocol for traders to create, or “etch” fungible tokens and track ownership using satoshis (1/100 millionth of 1 BTC). 
Of course, tracking ownership via satoshis is mathematically impossible without adopting Rodarmor’s Ordinals theory of how satoshis might, by shared belief, somehow persist across blockchain transactions on a modified First In First Out accounting method.
In truth, all satoshis are fully destroyed and newly recreated after every bitcoin transaction. There are no satoshi data bytes that persist across Bitcoin’s blockchain that anyone can physically or mathematically track. Bitcoin’s protocol allows a wallet owner to create brand new satoshis (technically, transaction outputs) every time it creates a transaction, provided that it burns an equal amount of satoshis (transaction inputs). 
Indeed, there is no actual ordering of satoshis on Bitcoin’s blockchain, which are constantly incinerated and recast at each and every transaction. Rodarmor’s Ordinals theory is simply an accounting method, among many possible methods, that requires node operators to run his proprietary, non-Bitcoin Core software to “track” the ownership of satoshis.

Runes launches and its first token is 99% premined
Despite the opt-in nature of Rodarmor’s centralized Ordinals protocol for trading Inscriptions or Runes, many traders believed that his new class of fungible tokens would become immensely valuable.
A pseudonymous etcher paid 6.732 BTC in the first block of Bitcoin’s fifth epoch for the privilege of etching Z•Z•Z•Z•Z•FEHU•Z•Z•Z•Z•Z. The etcher then used that top slot of provenance in Rodarmor’s new protocol, “the first Bitcoin Rune,” as marketing material for a questionable marketing campaign.
A website and X account launched offering bullish predictions about the price of the 14-character fungible token. The team claimed the market capitalization of “Fehu” would exceed Dogecoin. 
Of course, the token was a quintessential crypto pump. The founder pre-mined 99% of the supply. (Specifically, the founder owns 111,110,648 Fehu and only released 463 Fehu for anyone else.) This overwhelming control of supply allowed even tiny trades and miniscule secondary market volumes to mark its market capitalization into the billions.
On the day of Fehu’s creation, the token was trading on crypto exchange OKX at an average price of 249,786 satoshis (approximately $160). With a total supply of 111,111,111 Fehu, its 99%-founder-owned, mark-to-market capitalization exceeded $17 billion.
Rune #1 crashes 85% within a month
Today, Fehu is trading on OKX at a price of 32,000 satoshis (approximately $20.50). Its market capitalization is now $2.3 billion – and its founder still own 99% of its supply.
Even with that much insider ownership and commensurate ability to manipulate mark-to-market figures, Fehu has lost 85% of its market cap in less than a month.
Today, Fehu remains the largest Rune by market capitalization. The second- and third-largest runes and both worth less than a quarter billion dollars apiece as of press time.
For now, traditional meme coins on non-Bitcoin protocols remain far more popular. Dogecoin has a $23 billion market capitalization. Pepe exceeds $3.6 billion. Only time will tell whether crypto promoters can bring enough degeneracy into Rodarmor’s Runes protocol to inflate the value of Runes beyond these legacy meme coins.

Crypto Alert: Dormant Wallet Activates With Transfers $44 Million in Bitcoin: What’s Next?


							

Activation of dormant whale wallet with $43M in BTC raises concerns of potential selloff amid Bitcoin’s recovery.



Bitcoin’s surge past $64K triggers caution among traders due to overbought signals and potential trend reversal indicators.



Shorts dominating liquidations as Bitcoin rebounds, but impact of short squeeze may be limited, keeping market dynamics uncertain.




Bitcoin soared above the $64,000 threshold today, setting a momentous achievement in its current run-up.The resurgence in Bitcoin’s price was accompanied by a noteworthy event – the activation of a dormant wallet containing 687 BTC, valued at over $43 million as per Whale Alert data. This dormant Bitcoin whale, inactive for over a decade, made two substantial transfers to unknown wallets on Monday, totaling nearly $44 million.







As per Lookonchain, an onchain analytic firm, the first transaction involved the transfer of 625.42 BTC, amounting to a  $41 million. The second transfer moved 61.9 BTC, equivalent to approximately $4 million at the time. 



The dormant whale acquired this substantial sum of Bitcoin on January 12, 2014, when the cryptocurrency was valued at $917 per coin. The dormant whale’s BTC reserve, initially worth $630,000, has now soared to approximately $43.94 million.







However, this sudden transfer has raised concerns among investors regarding a potential selloff. The significant profit realized by the dormant whale strengthens the possibility of a dump, which could adversely affect Bitcoin’s price amidst its ongoing recovery. A selloff of such magnitude could potentially trigger a decline or sideways movement in the market, providing an opportunity for Bitcoin bears to capitalize on.







Bitcoin/USD 1-Day price chart, Source: Trading view



Despite Bitcoin’s successful rebound past $64,000, traders remain cautious as indicators suggest a potential reversal in the near future. The one-day stochastic RSI trading above the signal line indicates that Bitcoin is currently overbought, signaling a possible downturn. 



Moreover, the one-day MACD trading above the signal line suggests strong bearish momentum in the short term, with potential for further downward movement. Traders are advised to monitor for a crossover below the signal line, which could indicate a trend reversal.Additionally, the one-day ADX reading of 25.52 suggests moderate trend strength in the asset, but may not be robust enough to sustain significant price movement. Furthermore, shorts accounted for nearly 95% of total liquidations, according to Coinglass, although the impact of the short squeeze may be limited compared to recent days.

Polkadot (DOT) Gearing up for a 120% Price Surge: Analysts


																TL;DR

DOT experiences a 10% weekly price surge, with bullish predictions suggesting potential spikes to $10 and beyond, particularly if it surpasses certain key resistance levels.
Analysts previously envisioned further impulses for the asset, with forecasts ranging from $15.80 to a staggering $100.


How High Can DOT Jump?
Polkadot’s native cryptocurrency – DOT – has been among the best performers in the digital asset market lately, registering a 10% price increase on a weekly scale.
DOT Price, Source: CoinGecko
The popular entrepreneur, using the X handle Ted, recently argued that the token is retesting a major support zone. He believes DOT’s value could spike to $10 in the next few months if it surpasses the $7 mark. Recall that the asset crossed that level over the weekend.
CRYPTOWZRD and Jesse Olson outlined bullish predictions, too. The former thinks that the next bull run will start once DOT exceeds $9.60. 
“Above $9.60, we get another bullish impulse towards $15.80. Wave five is coming stronger… and most are going to miss it,” the analyst envisioned.
Jesse Olson went even further, claiming that DOT’s current condition offers investors the same buying opportunity as the one observed six months ago. The asset’s price stood at less than $5 at the start of November and pumped to almost $12 in mid-March. 




The Previous Predictions
Crypto analysts have recently become increasingly active in outlining DOT forecasts. The popular X user Ash Crypto (who has over one million followers) and Michael van de Poppe are among those who chipped in.
The former admitted still holding his DOT stash, raising hopes for a price rally toward a two-year high of $15. Michael van de Poppe maintained that Polkadot has shown “fundamental progress” over the years, claiming that “rotation is near.” He also revealed that he was adding the asset to his personal portfolio.
The most optimistic analyst to touch upon DOT is the crypto enthusiast Thomas Kralow. He predicted a price explosion towards the staggering $100 during the next bull run.

Bitcoin ETF snapshot: GBTC surprise helps end sector’s seven-day outflow run - Blockworks


The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) converted to an ETF nearly four months ago. 
It took that long for the fund to see its first day of net inflows. 
That unprecedented event occurred on Friday, when GBTC saw $63 million in net money enter the ETF, according to Farside Investors data. 
Read more: Why tracking bitcoin ETF flows matters. And why it doesn’t.
GBTC had suffered net outflows for 78 days before that — piling up to equal $17.4 billion.
Just don’t expect the GBTC inflows to become a regular thing, one segment observer says.
“It’s difficult to discern what might be behind the flows into GBTC,” said Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store. “ETF buyers are an extremely diverse group with varying motivations. That said, I would be surprised if the inflows become a trend.”
Part of the reason it will have a hard time consistently attracting new money? Its cost, Geraci noted.
Industry watchers have attributed GBTC’s constant asset spillage to the fund’s fee of 1.5% — a much higher level than its 10 competitors in the US. 
Beyond the fee, bankrupt lender Genesis was among those offloading its GBTC holdings, contributing to the asset exodus from the fund.   
And still, Grayscale holds the assets under management lead in the category. GBTC manages roughly $18.1 billion in assets, while BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is close behind with about $16.9 billion.
Grayscale has defended its higher fee, previously pointing out GBTC’s “market-leading liquidity, tight spreads, high trading volumes and a decade-long track record of operational success.”
“While GBTC can still hang its hat on ample liquidity and tight spreads, there are now competing products which can boast the same,” Geraci told Blockworks. 
The crypto asset manager also filed to set up the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), which would cost a fraction of GBTC’s price. The company has not yet revealed a final proposed expense ratio.

GBTC would seed the new fund as part of a “spin off” mechanism unique to commodity ETFs, according to Grayscale. In addition, a portion of GBTC’s bitcoin holdings would be allocated to the proposed Mini Trust.
Beyond Grayscale’s inflows on Friday, it was a day of net inflows for most of the 11-fund US spot bitcoin ETF category — amounting to $378 million collectively. 
The asset gains were an anomaly of late, snapping a record seven-day net outflow streak for the segment.  

Analysts and executives have pointed to expectations of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates higher for longer as one reason demand for bitcoin ETFs have stalled. 
The asset’s price also trended downward in April. 
Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at about $64,000 at about 10:30 am ET Monday — up about 1.4% from a week ago but down nearly 6% in the last 30 days.

Bitcoin Surges to $64,500, Marking Fresh Gains Amidst Bullish Momentum



                    

Bitcoin surged to $64,500 on May 4 during after-hours trading, marking fresh gains in its price trajectory.



According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, Bitstamp recorded a new local high of $64,522, setting a new peak for May.




The momentum, fueled by positive United States employment data, continued to build until the daily close. 



This was further supported by promising signs of recovery in the crypto market, notably with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) witnessing its first inflows in nearly three months.



As of the time of reporting, BTC/USD had seen a 5% increase month-to-date, as per CoinGlass data, contrasting with the 15% losses experienced in April.




In response to the market movement, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades expressed cautious optimism, stating, 



“Had a great push into the market close yesterday.” 



However, he emphasized patience, refraining from adding positions during the weekend until further clarity emerged.



Analysts noted a noticeable deviation between the latest CME Group Bitcoin futures closing price and BTC/USD, suggesting a potential future correction to fill the gap.




Despite the weekend’s impressive performance, concerns lingered regarding the market’s resilience without traditional financial participants.

Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, highlighted the risk of a correction due to thin order book liquidity.



Meanwhile, trader and commentator Credible Crypto suggested that shorting BTC might be favorable below the “main resistance” level around $69,000. 



He outlined two potential scenarios for BTC price action, indicating that current levels lacked sufficient liquidity.



Credible Crypto also noted that long positions in BTC would be attractive if BTC/USD dipped below $56,000, suggesting a strategic entry point for investors.

Bitfinex's Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino Made a Statement About the Hack News Spreading on X! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Paolo Ardoino, Bitfinex's Chief Technology Officer, confirmed that recent allegations of a database breach at the cryptocurrency exchange are “fake.”
Bitfinex CTO Says Alleged Database Breach Was 'Fake'
Bitfinex data breach allegations began circulating on social media last Saturday, following a tweet from Alice from Shinoji Research.


The tweet, which was later deleted, suggested that Bitfinex was the subject of a large-scale data breach by hacker group FSociety on April 26.
The tweet was reported by Walter Bloomberg, a breaking news account with more than 732,000 followers.





Citing Shinoji Research, Walter Bloomberg tweeted that Bitfinex's data, which included 2.5 Terabytes of information and personal information of 400,000 users, had been hacked.


Alice from Shinoji Research later corrected the information, saying: “It appears that this 'Flocker' group created a list of Bitfinex logins from other breaches. They then disguised the site as a ransom demand for a major breach.”
Ardoino reiterated in his statements that Bitfinex's user database was not breached and that the alleged hackers published a list of emails and passwords stolen from other breaches.



“Unfortunately, many users use the same email/password across many services, including crypto exchanges,” Ardoino said.


This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of unique passwords for each online service, especially platforms that process sensitive financial information.

How to Help the Bitcoin Community in Brazil Floods


The federal government installed a crisis office to closely monitor the situation with the rains that hit Rio Grande do Su, Brazil. The level of the Guaíba River reached its highest level since 1941, with more rain expected.
To date, more than 37 people have died, and more than 70 have been injured as storms have hit at least 235 municipalities. Among them is one of the most Bitcoiner cities in Brazil, Rolante.

Local authorities issued an alert and asked people in risk areas to leave. For instance, in Porto Alegre, the mayor declared a public calamity. As a result, the “Bitcoin é Aqui” community created a campaign to raise resources and funds to help Rolante and the more than 352 thousand people affected.
For now, the situation is still critical. Four dams are in emergency, and another nine are in a state of attention. In short, this means that if the rains continue, the water will continue to devastate hundreds of cities in the country’s south.
BeInCrypto spoke to a resident of Rolante who said the situation is very difficult.

“We need everything. However, the most serious situation is that of the city’s hospitals. We are without any type of service. If someone has a heart attack, there’s no way to respond,” Maria da Silva told BeInCrypto

Da Silva, who is now a volunteer, works on cleaning and rebuilding the city, and is appealing to the public to send equipment and water, among other things, urgently.

“If you have a company and want to donate supplies, cleaning materials, mattresses, medicines, tarpaulins and everything needed at this moment, get in touch by inbox and express your idea,” da Silva added.

How to Help During Brazil Floods?
It is possible to send donations in Brazilian Real and Bitcoin. These are the addresses:

PIX: 51.299.707/0001-81
BITCOIN via Lightning: [email protected]
BITCOIN via onchain: bc1q4w3mc5uztsznk6v64hwj097umr3p4cepayt6d3

The director of Rolante Hospital also made an appeal for help. The first floor was completely flooded, explains Luis Genaro Ladereche Figoli, who manages the institution. The water reached emergency sectors, specialty centers, hospitalization areas, radiology, and pharmacy, among other essential areas.

Genaro says he does not expect to resume the hospital’s activities in the short term because most of the equipment has been destroyed. The health institution is asking for equipment and cleaning materials donations.
Resident Uses Traceable Crypto Wallets
A resident of Santa Maria called Gerin.ETF took to X (formerly Twitter) to ask for donations for the city of 300,000 inhabitants.

“This week the situation got worse and it has already been declared the ‘Worst natural disaster that has ever occurred here in the south,’ it continues to rain every day, the markets are without products, as the roads are impassable, more than half of the city ​​without water, apart from many establishments closed due to lack of product/water and simply MANY people without a home… After this time without any improvement, I decided to run this campaign in order to help as many people as possible, we need to show our strength as WEB3,” Gerin said. 

Furthermore, Gerin.ETH has committed to donating the money to institutions that are helping with the tragedy, posting invoices, and recording the delivery of donations. He made three trackable web3 categories available.


Chave pix: 3fafb39d-d6b2-45fb-ac5b-83cd009bddbc (BANCO INTER

Sol Key (if possible donate USDC/USDT): 7Ke8usysxqmytwBnmhewaePyQFBCuFFmnFmiXNk9CNX1


Government Warns Against Scams
Finally, the state government created the SOS floods page. There, anyone can find information on how to volunteer and what and how to donate.
Pix: CNPJ: 92.958.800/0001-38Banco do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul
Attention: when carrying out the operation, confirm that the name of the account that appears is “SOS Rio Grande do Sul” and that the bank is Banrisul.

Arthur Hayes Adds to Seven-Figure Altcoin Position With $500,000 Purchase of DeFi Token - The Daily Hodl


								BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes just added about $500,000 to his seven-figure position in one decentralized finance (DeFi) altcoin project, according to on-chain data.
According to the Ethereum (ETH) block explorer Etherscan, Hayes has purchased more than 98,560 Pendle (PENDLE) tokens, a project that allows users to tokenize and sell future yields.










He made the transaction using Wintermute, a leading digital assets trading firm.
Source: Etherscan
Hayes, who is also an advisor for the Pendle project, currently holds more than 1,555,697 PENDLE tokens with a value of more than $7.7 million, according to Etherscan.
Hayes previously announced during the broader crypto market correction on May 2nd that he intended to up his investment in Pendle.
“I’m buying Solana and doggie coins (memecoins) for momentum trading positions. For longer-term sh*tcoin positions, I’m upping my allocations in Pendle and will identify other tokens that are ‘on sale.’ I will use the rest of May to increase my exposure. And then it’s time to set it, forget it, and wait for the market to appreciate the inflationary nature of the recent US monetary policy announcements.” 
He also believes that Bitcoin (BTC) could trade sideways until August.
Said Hayes,
“A rally to above $60,000 and then range-bound price action between $60,000 and $70,000 until August.” 
Pendle is trading for $4.96 at time of writing, down more than 3% in the last 24 hours.

'I Know The Future': Expert Loads Up On Shiba Inu


								The world of Shiba Inu (SHIB) is swirling with a mix of excitement and skepticism. Industry personality Del Crxpto ignited a buying frenzy with claims of possessing secret knowledge about future developments that will propel SHIB to new heights.

Shiba Inu Advocate Banks On Inside Information
Del Crxpto, a vocal Shiba Inu supporter, took to social media platforms, declaring he has confidential revelations into upcoming news that will significantly impact SHIB’s value. However, maintaining a shroud of secrecy, he refused to divulge any details, citing the need to preserve his connection with Shiba Inu officials.


This cryptic stance fueled speculation within the SHIB Army, the cryptocurrency’s dedicated community. Diehard enthusiasts, seemingly emboldened by Del Crxpto’s pronouncements, have doubled down on their SHIB holdings, anticipating a surge in price once the information becomes public.
On-Chain Data Reflects Growing Shiba Inu Army
The trend of accumulation is evident in on-chain data, the public record of cryptocurrency transactions. Santiment, a blockchain analytics firm, reported a steady rise in the number of addresses holding between 10,000 and 10 million SHIB tokens since March.
This signifies a growing investor base, potentially drawn in by the “one cent dream” – the community’s collective aspiration of SHIB reaching $0.01.
Source: Santiment
Silent Leader Raises Concerns
While excitement about the undisclosed developments simmers, some within the SHIB Army are expressing unease over the silence of Shytoshi Kusama, the anonymous leader of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Kusama has been noticeably absent from online discussions for weeks, leading to questions about his involvement and commitment to the project.

Shiba Inu is now trading at $0.00002. Chart: TradingView
Del Crxpto Defends Kusama’s Strategy
Del Crxpto stepped in to defend Kusama, assuring the SHIB Army that his silence is a strategic move. He pointed to Kusama’s proven track record of meticulously timing project launches to maximize impact.
“This is always how he has operated,” Del Crxpto emphasized, urging the community to maintain faith in Kusama’s vision and the “one cent dream.”

Shiba Inu’s Future: A Cocktail Of Hype And Reality
The current situation surrounding SHIB is a curious mix of optimism and caution. Del Crxpto’s claims, while generating excitement, lack transparency, raising questions about their legitimacy.
Reaching $0.01, as some dream, would require a monumental market shift, and analysts have previously cast doubt on its feasibility in the near future.

Investors, particularly newcomers, should approach SHIB with a dose of realism. While the prospect of positive developments is enticing, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research and understand the inherent volatility associated with cryptocurrency investments.
The “one cent dream” might remain just that – a dream – but for the true believers in the SHIB Army, the hope burns bright, fueled by cryptic pronouncements and unwavering community spirit.

More Bitcoin, Ethereum leave exchanges: What's going on? - AMBCrypto



Exchanges see less BTC and ETH.
Holders continued to increase despite the decline on exchanges.

Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] are the two largest assets based on their market capitalizations. But recent data indicates that one of them is becoming scarcer. 
Bitcoin and Ethereum on exchanges decline
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the Bitcoin and Ethereum Balance on Exchange metric indicated a decline in the availability of these assets on exchanges.
 Interestingly, Ethereum’s balance on exchanges has experienced a more pronounced decrease compared to Bitcoin. 
According to data from Glassnode spanning from March 2023 to the present, the ETH balance on exchanges has plummeted by nearly 6%.
 Starting at 16% in March 2023, it has declined to 10.66% as of the latest figures. 
Conversely, the BTC balance on exchanges has seen a milder decline of almost 2%, dropping from 13% in March 2023 to approximately 11.85% at press time.
Source: Glassnode
The dwindling balance of Ethereum on exchanges suggested increasing scarcity of the assets available for trading. 
Typically, a decline in balance on exchanges implies that holders are withdrawing their assets from trading platforms. 
In the case of Ethereum, it could also indicate that holders are withdrawing and staking their assets for potential returns, further reducing the available supply for trading.
Source: Glassnode
Has it affected the number of holders?
Bitcoin and Ethereum’s holders on Santiment revealed a consistent growth trend. 
At the time of this assessment, the number of BTC holders had reached almost 54 million, while Ethereum boasted over 121 million holders. 
This data suggests that both assets have steadily accrued holders over the past few months, indicating sustained interest and adoption.
Source: Santiment
The increase in the number of holders also aligns with the declining balance of these assets on exchanges, as observed in previous analyses. 
This trend suggests that holders are actively withdrawing their assets from exchanges, possibly for long-term holding or other investment strategies. 
Such behavior is generally interpreted as a positive sign for the assets, as it reflects confidence in their long-term value and utility.
Bitcoin and Ethereum in profit rises
Analysis of the Bitcoin and Ethereum supply in profit indicated a recent uptrend. As of this writing, the ETH supply in profit was almost 117 million, while BTC registered nearly 18 million. 

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24

This upward movement aligned with the recent price rebound observed in both BTC and ETH markets.
As of this writing, ETH was trading at approximately $3,200 with a gain of over 2%, while Bitcoin was priced at around $65,200, also experiencing an increase of almost 2%.

Marathon Digital, Kenyan government discuss crypto policy, energy use

Crypto miner Marathon Digital is in discussions with the Kenyan government on the country’s cryptocurrency policy and the energy requirements for crypto mining. Kenya has been gradually regulating the crypto market.President William Ruto announced at the American Chamber of Commerce Kenya Business Summit that Marathon has been asked to consult with the National Treasury and Ministry of Energy. The summit took place in late April but was not immediately reported on. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was among the attendees, and Marathon was a platinum-level sponsor of the event. In his keynote speech, Ruto said of the talks with Marathon:“This is a strong testament of the vast transformative possibilities that exist in an expanded and comprehensive understanding between the U.S. [and] East Africa concerning trade and investment.”Marathon is based in the United States but has joint mining ventures in Abu Dhabi and Paraguay. It is one of the world’s top five largest crypto miners. If the talks lead to a Marathon presence in the East African country, it would not be the first crypto miner to operate there.Related: Ethiopia makes data center deal with Hong Kong company, may start miningThe Kenya government long had a negative attitude toward cryptocurrency. However, it began efforts to regulate crypto in November 2022, two months after Ruto took office. The International Monetary Fund made critical observations on the lax crypto regulation in Africa in November 2022. Kenya ranked 11th in the world for crypto adoption that year.

There is a New Development in the Incident Where the SEC Hacked and Announced a Fake Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cryptocurrency journalist Eleanor Terrett shed new light on the infamous SEC hack that occurred on January 9. The hack, which led to an unauthorized early announcement regarding the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, is being investigated by several outside agencies, including the SEC, the Office of the Inspector General, and the FBI.
SEC Was Warned Before Hack by Cyber Security Experts
The last update from the SEC on January 22 showed that the investigation was continuing. However, Terrett's statement reveals that the SEC's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has appointed an independent company to review the information security program, which includes cybersecurity and infrastructure security, in 2023. Upon examination, it was determined that the program was incomplete; This fact was not widely known because the report was located inconspicuously on the SEC's website and was dated December 20, 2023.



According to CoinDesk, the fallout from the hack was significant, with losses of approximately $90 million reported in Bitcoin liquidations. Despite the seriousness of the incident, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler did not mention this report in his responses to members of Congress about the hack.
This raises serious questions about the SEC's stance on cybersecurity and its accountability in the face of such incidents. Terrett poses a thought-provoking question: “Imagine what the SEC would do if a public company became aware of a security vulnerability, failed to fix it, and was then hacked? Would the SEC have any reaction?”

Dogecoin Soars as Tesla Expands Range on DOGE Payment Support - DailyCoin


        
Electric car behemoth Tesla adds a Dogecoin note to their Checkout page.



Bitcoin’s quick recovery to $65K boosts Dogecoin with high price correlation.



Overbought position imposes a challenge on Dogecoin’s ride above $0.17.
Tesla Motors has recently updated its Frequently Asked Questions section on its homepage, elaborating on Dogecoin’s (DOGE) support as a means of payment. This has sparked a bullish wave for DOGE, leading to a surge to new weekly heights of $0.168.With a 30% upswing in price since last Thursday, Dogecoin’s acceptance rate also got a significant boost when Tesla’s official electronic shop’s checkout page was updated with the note: “Dogecoin may also be accepted on select products.” While the e-car giant has already started accepting DOGE for merchandise, CEO Elon Musk affirmed that payment in DOGE for Tesla’s electric cars will be available in the future.A Favorable Setup for DOGE’s Takeoff?The top dog coin reached a similar level on May 4, 2024, at $0.1668 but failed to jump above the key resistance of $0.17 twice since last weekend. Sporting a very high 0.97 price correlation with Bitcoin (BTC), DOGE faces a small resistance barrier from $0.167 to $0.183, where 99.2K crypto addresses hold 3.08 billion Dogecoins.However, Dogecoin’s double rejection at the $0.17 price range suggests that a market correction is impending, as DOGE showcased an overbought position in its Relative Strength Index (RSI), pointing to above 70 on the daily charts.
DOGE has a foundation of 82% Dogecoin custodians currently making a profit at this price range. Exhibiting stronger market liquidity than competing peers Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), DOGE’s combined order book favors the bulls by $7 million, with $89M bids and $82M sales over the past 24 hours.On the Flipside
In crypto derivatives markets, Dogecoin’s trading volume plunged 44% in a day, now totaling $3.12 billion.



Despite the substantial DOGE price surge, liquidated long positions outscored shorts by $2.48 million to $2.34 million.
Why This MattersDogecoin has been among the most widely accepted cryptocurrencies since 2021, when the token became popular across social media platforms.

Crypto lobbyists are busy preparing for the 2024 election | Protos


For the 2024 US presidential election, cryptocurrency is probably very low on the list of priorities for most voters. Domestically, there are many important issues like abortion, student loans, AI, immigration, social media regulation, and healthcare costs. On foreign policy, there are multiple military conflicts vying for people’s attention: Russia vs. Ukraine, Israel vs. Palestine, or China vs. Taiwan – to name just a few.
Nevertheless, while crypto is probably not a deciding issue for most, there is a small yet curiously growing Bitcoin maximalist community of single issue voters.

Crypto broadly has also attracted some national attention – mostly due to the total collapse of the gargantuan, $32 billion FTX and the millions of US customers it harmed. 
Crypto also gained mainstream press from celebrity scandals like Kim Kardashian, Logan Paul, Soulja Boy, Katy Perry, DJ Khaled, Austin Mahone, Floyd Mayweather, Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen, and Larry David. All of these celebrities promoted crypto assets that are now nearly worthless.
Crypto promoters earned a 10X since the 2020 election
Crypto is attracting more attention this election season than ever before, yet mostly for the wrong reasons. After all, the market capitalization of crypto has increased 1,000% since the last US presidential election. With their newfound gains, crypto millionaires are happy to throw their weight – and checkbooks – around Washington DC.
For example, someone trolled Elizabeth Warren by sending a request to her office to have a flag raised over the U.S. Capitol building in honor of Satoshi Nakamoto as part of the Capitol Flag Program. 
Coinbase alone spent $2.16 million on lobbying during the first three quarters of 2023. Foris DAX also funded lobbying by the businesses and organizations it backs, including the Blockchain Association.
According to Blockchain Association CEO Kristen Smith, its lobbying included efforts to “bridge the education gap” among policymakers and “build a commonsense regulatory framework.”
The biggest crypto lobbyist, FTX, is bankrupt
Several political candidates have been publicly embarrassed by revelations that they either took direct or indirect donations from FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried or an FTX-funded PAC. A criminal conviction proved that Bankman-Fried stole FTX customers’ money around the time he paid millions of dollars to lobbyists. Bankman-Fried made no secret of backing crypto-friendly Democratic candidates, for example.
Those millions from FTX and Bankman-Fried have, of course, dried up since FTX went bankrupt. Bankman-Fried had previously spent $40 million to influence the 2022 midterm elections with mixed results. However, that does not mean that crypto lobbyists have gone away.
Even with FTX money gone, crypto lobbyists have tried to keep working. They kickstarted a bill that would have provided a regulatory framework around so-called stablecoins. The collapse of Terraform Labs and its multi-billion dollar algorithmic stablecoin UST highlighted the risks surrounding stablecoins. Over the years, Protos has covered hundreds of instances of various stablecoins deviating from their intended $1 peg.
In response, giant stablecoin issuer Tether got involved in Washington DC itself. It spent $760,000 on lobbying during the first three quarters of 2023. This is a negligible expense given that its eponymous stablecoin tether (USDT) has a market cap exceeding $110 billion — the world’s third-largest crypto asset.
Read more: Here’s what the biggest stablecoins spent on lobbying in the US
Cheering for the understaffed, crypto-friendly CFTC
Crypto lobbyists also moved to displace authority from the well-staffed SEC to the drastically smaller and more crypto-friendly CFTC. Bills that would “better define” the responsibilities of the SEC regarding digital assets advanced in committees in December 2023 thanks in large part to crypto lobbyists’ efforts.
For years, pro-crypto lobbyists have cast doubt on the SEC and characterized the CFTC versus SEC jurisdictional overlap as a tug of war between equally competent, staffed, and effectual regulators. They also drum up immense media attention for the SEC’s rare losses in court against crypto defendants. These two lines of lobbying and public relations work help to keep politicians distracted from the overwhelmingly victorious track record of the SEC against crypto promoters who violate securities laws.
“It’s just been a busy war,” Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad while discussing the bills and Coinbase’s multi-million-dollar lobbying efforts.
Crypto lobbyists also have not relented in funding Political Action Committees (PACs) that support crypto-friendly candidates. Fairshake raised $78 million to support pro-digital asset candidates, for example, from businesses like Coinbase, Binance, Ripple, and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).
Moreover, crypto lobbyists are not limiting their efforts to influencing candidates running for Congress. The Chamber of Digital Commerce, DeFi Education Fund, and even Senator Cynthia Lummis sent amicus briefs calling for the dismissal of the SEC’s case against Coinbase to the federal court presiding over that case.
The Blockchain Association and Crypto Freedom Alliance of Texas recently filed a lawsuit alleging that the SEC violated rules for creating new regulations when it expanded its definition of “dealer” to include potentially relevant digital asset activity.
Read more: Binance ordered to pay $2.7B to CFTC, former chief to pay $150M
Politicians talk crypto now
Even politicians themselves have tried to make crypto a matter of some national policies. Senator Elizabeth Warren warned of US adversaries like Iram outcompeting US-based Bitcoin miners. Tertiary presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy announced a plan for digital assets that included using bitcoin to somehow partially back the US Dollar and eliminating some capital gains taxes involving sales of bitcoin.
Although it is unclear whether crypto lobbyists have personally communicated with Donald Trump, the leading Republican candidate recently changed his tune on bitcoin. Previously, he called bitcoin a scam. 
More recently, however, Trump called crypto an “additional form of currency.” Part of his change in tune could be explained by the millions in ETH he received by selling questionable NFTs, sneakers, and event tickets.

While some politicians are unlikely to change their negative stance toward digital assets so close to the November 2024 presidential election, others seem at least open to learning more about it. Lobbyists are certainly ready to answer questions about digital assets – perhaps over cocktails at Hillwood, the Meridian Ball, or any of Washington DC’s other decadent galas.

Crypto Whale Spends $10.4 Million On PEPE, Do They Know Something You Don’t?


                            A crypto whale’s transaction involving the third-largest meme coin by market cap, PEPE, has drawn the crypto community’s attention. The magnitude of the transaction, coupled with some other whale transactions, suggests that it may be high time to pay more attention to PEPE. 
Crypto Whale Spends $10.4 Million On PEPE
On-chain analytics platform Spotonchain revealed a wallet (3eAaAC3C9) that had purchased 1.238 trillion PEPE from Binance at an average price of $0.000008424 ($10.4 million). This wallet then proceeded to withdraw the tokens in two transactions. On-chain data shows that the whale withdrew 322.5 billion PEPE in the first transaction and the remaining 915.85 billion PEPE in the second transaction. 

At the time of writing, the whale hasn’t moved the tokens, suggesting they may be looking to hold for the long term. Some notable smart traders look to have been accumulating the meme coin lately, most likely in anticipation of significant price moves from it. Spotonchain also recently revealed two whales that had withdrawn 660.7 billion PEPE from Binance and MEXC. 
The platform also mentioned another whale that withdrew 322.48 billion PEPE ($2.68 million) from Binance for the first time. More recently, Spotonchain drew the crypto community’s attention to a smart trader who has been profiting from the meme coin since last year. This trader is said to have completed 8 trades and realized a cumulative profit of $917,000. 
Seeing how PEPE has performed since the start of the year, these whales’ interest in the meme coin isn’t surprising. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that PEPE has made a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 500%, and this bullish momentum looks to be far from over. Interestingly, many traders have yet to jump on the the wave, as just over 200,000 persons hold the meme coin. 
Price To Hit New All-time High (ATH) Soon
Crypto analyst Plazma recently suggested that PEPE could soon hit a new all-time high. PEPE’s current ATH is at $0.00001074, with the meme coin trading just 20% below this price level. Crypto analyst Yazan also hinted that meme coin would soon hit a new all-time high, asking his followers if they were ready for this to happen. 

PEPE is currently ranked as the thirtieth largest crypto token by market cap and is likely to climb higher if it eventually hits a new ATH. Crypto analyst and trader Murad believes that the meme coin could rise to the top 10 crypto tokens by market cap since he predicted that PEPE could flip Shiba Inu (SHIB) and possibly Dogecoin (DOGE).
At the time of writing, the meme coin is trading at around $0.000008615, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin price still in ‘prime buy zone’ even with rally to $65K

Bitcoin (BTC) price tagged $65,000 during the early Asian trading session on May 6 as the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) held as BTC’s immediate support.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed that the BTC/USD pair turned up from lows of $63,340 on May 6, rising 3.45% to an intra-day high of $65,523.BTC/USD daily chart.

However, since every accumulation period was shortly followed by a price increase, the whale accumulation has been “dwindling.” In a May 6 post on X social platform, IntoTheBlock said, “Prices have increased shortly following every accumulation.

Google using Gemini AI chatbot to combat security threats

Google’s new threat intelligence solution includes a generative artificial intelligence-powered chatbot that can analyze potential malware and quickly provide a summary for customers so they can tackle threats faster.Wegovy and Ozempic: Are we ready for weight loss drugs?Google Threat Intelligence is a new offering from the company that combines its Mandiant threat intelligence team, VirusTotal community of over one million users, and Google’s network of billions of signals across devices and emails to quickly tackle threats. It also includes Gemini in Threat Intelligence, which is an AI-powered agent customers can use to search how to protect against security threats. By combining its Gemini 1.5 Pro model with its other offerings, Google says it has “supercharged the threat research processes, augmented defense capabilities,” and cut down the time it takes to identify and protect against security. With Google Threat Intelligence, the company said its customers can use Gemini to “condense large data sets in seconds” and analyze suspicious files faster. Gemini 1.5 Pro can make reverse engineering malware simpler, according to Google. The reverse engineering process is how cybersecurity professionals analyze advanced software. For example, Google said Gemini 1.5 Pro took 34 seconds to analyze and find the kill switch for a malware file called WannaCry. Google Threat Intelligence can produce custom threat summaries from a decade’s worth of threat reports in seconds, Google said. “While there is no shortage of threat intelligence available, the challenge for most is to contextualize and operationalize intelligence relevant to their specific organization,” Dave Gruber, principal analyst, Enterprise Strategy Group, said in a statement. Google’s new offering gives “security teams a new means to operationalize actionable threat intelligence to better protect their organizations.”Google, which announced Google Threat Intelligence at the RSA Conference in San Francisco on Monday, said each day it protects four billion devices and 1.5 billion emails, while blocking 100 million phishing attempts. The company also announced new AI-powered features for its Security Operations, including an Investigation Assistant that can help respond to threats by answering security questions, summarizing events, looking for threats, and other actions, as well as its Playbook Assistant,  can help security teams build response playbooks that simplify tasks requiring more expertise.

SEC cracks down on Robinhood for selling unregistered crypto securities

The crypto arm of trading platform Robinhood has received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegedly violating securities laws.Wegovy and Ozempic: Are we ready for weight loss drugs?A Wells notice is a formal notification from the financial watchdog that it intends to take enforcement action against the trading platform, but it does not necessarily mean the SEC will sue Robinhood. The SEC will give the company a chance to respond and explain why it believes a civil suit is inappropriate.Despite the legal warning, shares of Robinhood were up 1.25%, trading at $18 Monday afternoon.Since Bitcoin’s inception, crypto advocates have debated whether it should be treated as a currency, commodity, or security. The SEC believes cryptos are securities, and therefore fall under its jurisdiction. Following the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, the financial watchdog has become even more aggressive in enforcing laws against crypto companies.Robinhood, which has long been a crypto advocate, strongly denied the SEC’s classification. “We firmly believe that the assets listed on our platform are not securities and we look forward to engaging with the SEC to make clear just how weak any case against Robinhood Crypto would be on both the facts and the law,” Robinhood chief legal officer Dan Gallagher said in a post on the company’s official blog.In 2021, Robinhood was one of the first platforms to allow Dogecoin trading on its app, and as a result, 62% of its crypto revenue came from Dogecoin. Moreover, it launched a cryptocurrency wallet in the same year that gained popularity among investors.However, in 2023, Robinhood had to delist Cardano, Polygon, and Solana cryptocurrencies after the commission named them as unregistered securities in lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance.The SEC sued crypto exchange Coinbase for breaking securities laws. Earlier this year, the financial watchdog sent subpoenas to the Ethereum Foundation, the ecosystem that works behind the Ethereum blockchain network, to classify Ether as a security. The crypto companies are fighting back against the SEC. Last month, a company named Consensys filed a lawsuit against the financial watchdog, accusing it of attempting to control the future of cryptocurrency.

Voting FED Member Barkin Makes Important Economic and Interest Rate Statements This Year - Bitcoin Sistemi

Richmond FED President Thomas Barkin expressed his expectation that higher interest rates would further slow the economy and reduce inflation to the central bank's 2% target.
Barkin, who has the right to vote on monetary policy this year, said in a statement today that the strong labor market offers the FED an opportunity to ensure that inflation falls sustainably before reducing borrowing costs. However, he also warned of the risk that persistent inflation in housing and services could drive high price increases, as has been observed this year.


“I'm optimistic that today's restrictive interest rate level can reduce demand to bring inflation back to our target,” Barkin said in a speech to the Rotary Club of Columbia in South Carolina. “The full impact of higher interest rates has yet to be seen.”
Last week, US Federal Reserve officials kept their benchmark interest rate unchanged since July of the previous year, keeping it at a level not seen in more than two decades. Following the decision, FED Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the latest inflation data did not provide the committee with increased confidence that price increases had slowed to 2%. Powell did not specify when he believes the Fed will cut interest rates.






Richmond FED President Barkin pointed out that sellers are still trying to increase prices and will continue to do so until there is a significant response from customers.
“The risk is that as we receive less aid from the goods sector, continued housing and services inflation will leave the overall index above our target,” Barkin said. “That's what we've seen so far this year.”


The FED's preferred inflation index increased by 2.7% in March compared to the previous year, rising to the 2.5% rate observed in February. Barkin called the inflation figures for the beginning of 2024 “disappointing.”
Despite these challenges, the labor market has remained resilient, but there are also signs of moderation. U.S. employers cut back on hiring in April and the unemployment rate rose unexpectedly. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 175,000 last month, the smallest gain in six months, according to a report released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Bitcoin Whale Moves $44 Million After a Decade-Here's How Much It Gained - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsA mysterious holder has moved Bitcoin (BTC) worth nearly $44 million after receiving the coins over 10 years ago and ultimately letting them gather dust in the meantime.Blockchain data shows that the 687.33 BTC—today worth $43.7 million—were moved late Sunday after a decade of dormancy. The coins first arrived at the address in January 2014, when 1 BTC was worth less than $900, and hadn't moved since, the data shows.The price of BTC now stands at $63,467, according to CoinGecko, meaning the lucky investor is sitting on gains of 7,228%.Interestingly, blockchain data suggests that the as-yet-unidentified holder paid less than $2 as a transaction fee to move the coins on Sunday.CryptoQuant, which monitors blockchain activity, told Decrypt that the coins came from block rewards from back in 2011, so it's highly likely the BTC belongs to an early miner.Bitcoin miners are people—or organizations—which work to keep Bitcoin network running. Using computers and lots of energy, they mint new coins and process transactions and are rewarded in BTC for doing so.In the crypto world, Bitcoin whales are investors who hoard huge amounts of the asset and don’t touch it for years. But today's movements weren't made by a whale. Investors are typically considered Bitcoin whales if they hold at least 1,000 BTC, or at least $63.5 million worth. Such 'HODLers' are typically large institutions or companies.Regardless of what defines a whale, long-term holders have been shown to be the most successful investors as the price of BTC has only gone up steadily over the past decade—despite the volatility along the way.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Buffett Holding Record Cash And Sells Apple, Here Is How Much Cash You Should Hold - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - Benzinga

To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.Holding CashPlease click here for an enlarged chart of Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE: BRK-B).Note the following:
	This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of BRK.B stock is being used to illustrate the point.
	The chart shows Warren Buffett’s company BRK.B broke out at the beginning of the year with the rest of the market.
	The chart shows that BRK.B has been consolidating in the resistance zone
	Buffett has made two important disclosures.
	
		Buffett is now holding a record amount of cash, $189B.
		Buffett reduced his Apple Inc AAPL position by 22% to $135.4B as of March 31, 2024. Buffett was holding $174.3B of AAPL stock at the end of 2023. Buffett appears to have sold about 115M shares or about 13% of his AAPL holdings.
	
	
	Buffett said, “Today things aren’t attractive.” How much cash should you hold? The Arora Report provides this guidance every day in the protection band. Please see the “Protection Band And What To Do Now” section below.
	Buffett also said, “We’d love to spend it, but we won’t spend it unless we think they’re doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money.” This is, in part, also the secret behind The Arora Report’s success and popularity among individual investors, investment advisors, and money managers. The Arora Report teaches investors not to rush in and buy just because you have cash. It is to your own benefit to wait for dips in the buy zones and to also not buy when market conditions are not favorable.
	In The Arora Report analysis, Buffett chose not to do a major buyback of BRK.B stock because he knows that BRK.B stock, along with the rest of the stock market, is overvalued. 
	Prudent investors should note the following:

Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Traditional 60/40 PortfolioProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

Earn Using BetFury Crypto Loans With the Lowest Interest Rate



                    

BetFury is the 1st iGaming platform that launched competitive Crypto Loans, expanding its crypto ecosystem. Every BetFury user can now create positions with a minimum permissible 50% LTV and the lowest interest rate among the leading CEXs. Uncover how to seamlessly leverage your holdings for instant liquidity without selling!



What are Crypto Loans on BetFury?



BetFury Crypto Loans – a financial service that provides users with access to liquidity in exchange for collateral. You can create fixed-term loan positions with fixed interest rates throughout the loan terms. BetFury offers isolated loan positions meaning each collateral-loan pair position holds its distinct Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios as well as margin call and liquidation LTV levels. 




Crypto Loans are helpful for those who want to use one currency instead of another without trading. If you’re confident in the growth of Bitcoin but want to keep holding it, you can borrow the most suitable currency and receive profit from this maneuver. 



Leading crypto for borrowing and collateral usage 



BetFury provides a diverse range of assets for loan and collateral, including USDT, BTC, and ETH. Still, the platform does not support the use of the same cryptocurrency for both collateral and loan within a single loan position. That’s why you cannot use BTC as collateral and borrow BTC in the same loan position.







Benefits of Using BetFury Crypto LoansBetFury became a pioneer by introducing Crypto Loans into the iGaming area. Moreover, it has provided intense competition to well-known platforms. What are the main reasons for BetFury’s uniqueness in a crypto borrowing world?



👉https://betfury.io/





The Lowest Interest RateBetFury offers the lowest interest rate among CEXs. Let’s say you borrow USDT for 30 days, your annual interest rate will be only 6.6%. It’s 5-6 times less than on some well-known exchanges. 





Creating Positions With LTV < Initial LTVYou can create a position with a 50% minimum possible LTV. Simply put, when you place a higher collateral amount, you will be much further away from Liquidation.



The Gap Between Margin Call LTV & Liquidation LTVBetFury has increased the gap between Margin Call LTV and Liquidation LTV to ensure more time for users to react and stabilize the borrowing position.



Uniqueness Among CompetitorsThe above aspects distinguish BetFury from its direct competitors, such as other online casinos and top centralized exchanges.




How to Earn via BetFury Crypto Loans?



You can utilize the loan for various purposes, such as placing bets, engaging in crypto swaps, depositing into BetFury Earn products, or withdrawing funds from the platform. However, the collateral will remain with BetFury Crypto Loans as security for the return of the digital assets you’ve borrowed.







Here are several key aspects to keep in mind while profitably earning from Crypto Loans: 




Keep track of LTV levels




The BetFury Crypto Loans system is simple and centered around the LTV, which is the ratio (%) of the loan to the collateral amount. As one of the other perks, BetFury has a high initial LTV from 75% to 80%. The main thing when borrowing is the ability to control the LTV. This value has three levels: Initial LTV, Margin Call LTV, and Liquidation LTV.




Earn with borrowed crypto assets on BetFuryThe platform has many gainful crypto products and exclusive offers for BFG holders. If you convert BFG to unique stBFG tokens and join BFG Staking, you will double your passive income and get up to 70% APY. There’s also an earning option via crypto Futures allowing for simple earning in a new entertaining format. Explore these and more options on BetFury!



Avoid LiquidationOnce you reach a Liquidation LTV, the platform automatically liquidates your collateral assets to repay the loan.  As mentioned above, BetFury has a significant gap between Margin Call LTV and Liquidation LTV, so controlling risks will be much easier. If you follow all the rules and create effective strategies, it’ll be easier to get income using Crypto Loans.




Conclusion



BetFury Crypto Loans is a tool that provides easy access to liquidity and opens a door to the crypto world for any user. Implementation of this feature takes a solid step toward further BetFury’s growth. Who thought the iGaming platform would add competitive crypto borrowing on par with top CEXs? BetFury has once again demonstrated that it could unite crypto enthusiasts and players in one place. Therefore, borrow top currencies and fill your digital balance.




About BetFury



BetFury is an established ecosystem with crypto-earning features, iGaming, and Sports betting. The platform has a global community of 2M+ users for over four years of progress. 



Multiple crypto-staking options are available on BetFury for users who prioritize competitive rewards and leading tokens for earning. When you sign up on BetFury, you receive a Welcome Pack with up to $10 500 Deposit Bonuses and 225 Free Spins.



If you prefer a team approach to gaining rewards, you can join a Referral Program. The referrer gets a $1,500 bonus and a 30% commission for the referral’s activity with an opportunity for reward.

Jack Dorsey’s Block to raise $1.5B in senior notes offering

Fintech firm Block — formerly Square — announced plans on May 6 to issue $1.5 billion in senior notes through a private placement to qualified institutional investors. The company said in a statement that the terms of the notes, including interest rates and maturity dates, are subject to negotiation with the initial purchasers. Investors permitted to join the round include pension funds, banks, mutual funds, and high-net-worth individuals.Block’s shares (NYSE: SQ) rose more than 4% following the announcement, trading at $72.40 at the time of writing.Block Inc (SQ) on May 6, 2024. Source: Google FinanceA private placement is a method of raising capital through the sale of securities, such as stocks or notes, to a limited number of investors rather than through a public offering. According to Block, funds raised through the sale may be used for the repayment of existing debt, potential acquisitions and strategic transactions, capital expenditures, investments and working capital.According to Fitch Ratings, Block is “well positioned to capitalize on secular growth areas in payments and consumer financial services.” Regarding the fintech debt structure, Fitch noted that Block has relied on the convertible debt market for most of its external capital needs since its initial public offering (IPO). As of March 2024, the company had approximately $2.15 billion in outstanding convertible notes, a revolving credit facility of $775 million available until June 2028, and $2 billion in senior unsecured notes due in 2026 and 2031. Fitch wrote:"The announced debt raise would bring additional debt onto its balance sheet, that is expected to ultimately help refinance 2025-2026 maturities, while also providing further cash support to its already strong balance sheet."Block was one of the first public companies to add Bitcoin (BTC) to its balance sheet, recently noted the firm’s co-founder, Jack Dorsey, in a letter to shareholders. Dorsey also revealed the company plans to allocate 10% of its gross profit from Bitcoin products every month for BTC purchases. Block purchased $220 million worth of Bitcoin between the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021.“Going forward, each month we will be investing 10% of our gross profit from Bitcoin products into Bitcoin purchases.”The fintech firm’s earnings beat market expectations in the first quarter of 2024. Block’s Bitcoin gross profit was $80 million, representing 3% of its $2.73 billion in Bitcoin revenue. Its mobile payments and crypto platform Cash App made $1.26 billion in gross profits for Q1 — up 25% from the year before.Total gross profit for the first quarter reached $2.09 billion, up 22% from the year-ago quarter. The company posted total revenue of $5.96 billion, with per-share earnings of $0.85 — beyond analysts’ predictions.

Solana's Dogwifhat Pumps as Bonk, Dogecoin and Other Meme Coins Lose Ground - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin is trading at $63,330, representing a -1.5% dip in the last 24 hours as it recovers from a dip last week. The rest of the crypto market is following suit, and meme coins are also suffering. They post big gains when markets are green, but bleed hard when bears take over.Solana-based Dogwifhat (WIF) is the only meme coin in the top 100 of the largest cryptocurrencies that is posting gains today, edging up from $3.20 to $3.36, marking a 2.75% spike in the last 24 hours. The coin is currently correcting after reaching a daily high of $3.66.Overall, WIF seems to be trading sideways, testing its resistance once again as it looks to break into a stable bullish trend. The zone between $2.20 and $3.50 has kept the prices contained since March, with a short exception between March 28 and April 10. Given this balance of forces, the coin is suitable for day traders and swing traders to open and close positions with small gains, playing with those supports and resistances.The Average Directional Index (or ADX, an indicator that measures how stable a market trend is) is weak at 21 points, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures how bullish or bearish a coin is, seems balanced at 55 points, and the EMA10 and EMA55 are extremely close. All of this points to indecision in the markets.A bullish forecast would send WIF up around 11% to the resistance at around $3.50, and a bearish forecast sends the coin 24% down to the support at around $2.20.The remaining leading meme coins are not performing well today.BONK, probably one of the most hyped meme coins of the last bull run, is today the worst performing meme coin in the Top 100, down 6.3% in the last 24 hours. BONK has been trading sideways and has remained flat since mid-March, bouncing between $0.00002950 and $0.00001940 with an atypical dip in mid-April.The bullish and bearish scenarios remain the same as our last price report, marked by both support and resistance. An optimistic performance would take BONK to $0.00002950 for an 18% spike, and a pessimistic performance would dip the coin 20% to $0.00001940.Dogecoin, the OG meme coin, is taking a similar course. The coin is recovering from a bearish correction that took its price down -45% in April. Right now, DOGE is trading at $0.1563, representing a -4.14% dip in the last 24 hours, with an overall weekly rebound of 10% in the last 7 days.The coin tried to break the support set at around $0.14, but failed to keep momentum and rebounded shortly after it touched $0.13.Right now, DOGE is back to the zone inside the horizontal channel with a weak ADX and a perfectly balanced RSI at 50 points. A bullish scenario sends the coin 27% up to $0.20 to test the channel's resistance, and a bearish scenario sends the coin back to the channel's support at around $0.13 for a -8.5% dip.The rest of the top meme coins are also posting losses today, all showing pretty similar market behavior.PEPE is currently priced at $0.000008507 for a -0.2% loss, testing its channel's resistance at $0.00000882 and seemeling looking to bounce down after this recovery. Floki Inu is trading hands at around $0.0001818 for a -3.5% dip in the last 24 hours, and Farcaster's Degen is down -12%, currently trading at around $0.01974.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

15 Years In: Bitcoin Blockchain Hits Major Transaction Milestone | Bitcoinist.com


								As Bitcoin, the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency, records 15 years since its inception, its blockchain has also achieved a significant milestone. Bitcoin’s blockchain recently surpassed a major transaction benchmark, processing a total of 1 billion transactions on its network, marking a historic moment in the digital asset space.
Bitcoin Transactions Exceed 1 Billion
Since emerging in the financial landscape in 2009, when pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the cryptocurrency’s white paper, Bitcoin has significantly reshaped the financial ecosystem, attracting millions of users who continually engage in decentralized transactions daily. 

On May 5, 2023, Bitcoin’s blockchain hit a historic milestone, achieving more than one billion network transactions. This accomplishment underscores the cryptocurrency’s considerable utility and widespread adoption across various regions and sectors of the world. 
From everyday consumers to retail and institutional investors, BTC has overcome demographic limitations and barriers, offering truly decentralized payment solutions across multiple markets and global organizations. 
According to data from Clark Moody’s Dashboard, a platform which displays the metrics of Bitcoin’s ecosystem, BTC’s total transactions over the last 15 years have reached $1,000,369,716. This means that over 178,000 transactions were processed daily and more than 15.5 million were executed monthly. 
Additionally, mempool, a waiting area for pending and unconfirmed BTC transactions disclosed that the one billionth Bitcoin transaction was mined into the 842,241th block by Foundry Pool.  
Typically, a higher transaction count underscores a network’s substantial user base and increased engagement. While this is advantageous for a thriving blockchain ecosystem, it may also result in elevated transaction fees. 
DeFiLama has reported a total of $1.297 billion in average fees generated by the Bitcoin network over the course of one year. Within a single month, transactional fees reached an astonishing $284.07 million, against the backdrop of a total market capitalization of $1.28 trillion. 
BTC Inches Closer To $70,000 Price Mark
Amidst the surging transaction levels and Bitcoin’s one billion transaction milestone, the price of the cryptocurrency has been rising steadily, breaking key support levels to trade above $65,000. The cryptocurrency is slowly getting closer to the $70,000 price mark, surging by 2.44% in the last 24 hours and 4.61% over the past seven days. 

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $65,238, with a 24-hour trading volume of more than $20.3 billion. Crypto analyst, Ali Martinez has revealed that based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) 90-day ratio, BTC is still positioned in a prime buying zone despite its surge from $57,000 to over $64,000.

Hong Kong's crypto ETFs struggle to match U.S. success

A new range of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong has failed to mirror the explosive launch of their US counterparts. Early data suggests inflows and assets under management in the first week were lackluster—raising fresh questions about investor interest.Structural limitationsIn the first week since their April 30 launch, the three Hong Kong-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs together amassed only $262 million in assets, with inflows of less than $14 million. That pales compared to the billions poured into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs upon their January launch.For a first-of-its-kind offering, the pair of Ether ETFs managed a slightly more middling success, with $54.2 million in AUM and $9.3 million in inflows as of May 6. Analysts had higher expectations for this pioneering crypto offering.Farside investors suggest that despite such benefits as multi-currency denominations and in-kind creation/redemption, the small and illiquid equities market of Hong Kong bars its ETF industry from matching American inflows. Indeed, with a total market cap of $4.5 trillion versus  $50 trillion across U.S. exchanges, Hong Kong cannot reasonably hope to match American inflows.“That $310 million for the Hong Kong crypto ETF is relative to $50 billion in the U.S. market,” said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.One major hurdle is that Mainland Chinese investors are currently excluded; the ETFs are out of reach for them unless they hold Hong Kong residency. An OSL study found that nearly 80% of Hong Kong investors who are interested in cryptocurrencies plan to invest. Hong Kong’s  ETFs barriers to adoptionHowever, researchers at SoSoValue caution that the Hong Kong cryptocurrency ETF is still strict in qualifying investors, and mainland investors are not allowed to participate in transactions. The market is is looking forward to the trading of mainland funds through southbound Hong Kong Stock Connect, but current regulations do not allow it, and this is expected to be difficult to open for a long time.Management fees on the Hong Kong ETFs on crypto are 0.85% to 1.99% per annum, following an initial period of low cost. That contrasts with the 0.25% average for U.S. ETF issuers, making long-term holding more economical.SoSoValue researchers added that for institutional investors who are optimistic about the crypto market and, therefore, have a long-term holding view, the cost of holding would be lower for the U.S. Bitcoin ETF.Indeed, slow growth in the Mainland, at least since 2022, has dampened economic activity and investor sentiment in Hong Kong. The region’s comparatively illiquid equities sector simply cannot realistically support the same level of ETF demand as more developed U.S. markets, at least for the time being.

Bitwise CIO says regulatory hurdles are a boon for Coinbase amid SEC crackdown on crypto firms

In the wake of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent crackdown on crypto firms, Bitwise Investments CIO Matt Hougan offered insights suggesting that the regulatory landscape might be inadvertently favoring US crypto exchange Coinbase.Hougan proposed in a recent social media post that the current regulatory environment creates an “artificial moat” for Coinbase’s operations — potentially providing the platform with advantages over its competitors. He added that the exchange may be leveraging regulatory challenges to solidify its position.According to the Bitwise CIO:“The hostile regulatory environment is creating an artificial ‘moat’ for Coinbase’s business, helping sustain extremely high margins and allowing them to over-earn in the short-term.”Hougan’s perspective points out that Coinbase, as the sole registered crypto exchange in the US, has successfully capitalized on the uncertain regulatory environment, securing an impressive $7.1 billion in funding.Additionally, Hougan highlighted Coinbase’s efforts to diversify beyond its core exchange services, citing initiatives such as the growth of USDC, Base, and expansion into international futures trading. These endeavors illustrate the exchange’s commitment to expanding its presence within the crypto ecosystem.While Hougan commended Coinbase’s adaptability in navigating the regulatory climate, he acknowledged that his perspective represents just one viewpoint amid a complex regulatory landscape.The long-term implications of the SEC’s strict oversight and the sustainability of Coinbase’s current advantage remain uncertain. Hougan’s remarks come at a time of heightened regulatory scrutiny on other platforms — notably Robinhood’s crypto division, Uniswap Labs, and Consensys.The SEC  issued a Wells Notice to Robinhood on May 6, alleging violations of securities regulations concerning certain digital asset listings. This suggests potential legal challenges for Robinhood, similar to those faced by Coinbase in the past.In response to the Wells Notice, Robinhood has expressed its commitment to ongoing dialogue with the SEC, maintaining that the digital assets listed on its platform do not constitute investment contracts. Meanwhile, Consensys has sued the SEC, while Uniswap said it intends to challenge the regulator’s claims.Coinbase itself has also previously received a Wells Notice from the SEC in March 2023, indicating regulatory concerns about its listed digital assets and staking services. Additionally, the exchange is facing a new lawsuit from customers alleging securities violations.Mentioned in this article

Bitcoin Mixers Pull Out of the US Amid Regulatory Heat - Decrypt

Following the arrest of the developers of Samourai Wallet, several other Bitcoin coin mixing operations see the writing on the wall and are leaving the United States for more crypto-friendly regions.In April, the US Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York charged Samourai Wallet founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill with operating “a cryptocurrency mixer” that the agency said executed over $2 billion in unlawful transactions and facilitated more than $100 million in money laundering transactions with illegal dark web marketplaces.After Samourai Wallet shut down, Wasabi Wallet developers ZKSnacks announced the preemptive closure of its mixing service, banning U.S. customers from using its services."Wasabi's website and API are unaccessible from the US effective immediately,” a Wasabi Wallet representative told Decrypt. “ZkSNACKs is suspending its coinjoin service for all users at the end of May.”Image: A notice U.S. customers see on the Wasabi Wallet website.Hardware wallet Trezor followed suit on May 2, announcing that its mixer service was also going away.“We deeply value the privacy of our users, and it is with great regret that we must announce the discontinuation of the Coinjoin feature for Trezor Suite by [June 1] latest, as our partner will no longer provide this service,” Trezor wrote on Twitter.American citizens are being increasingly shut out as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) leads other regulatory and law enforcement agencies along a warpath against cryptocurrency.The SEC has established a long history of what many critics—including regulators within the agency—have called “regulation by enforcement.” It has charged crypto coin mixer developers for acting as illegal money transmitters, while the U.S. Department of Justice has charged several crypto developers with money laundering.A coin mixer or "coinjoin" is a service that allows users to obfuscate the origin and destination of transactions. Users send cryptocurrency to the service, which is mixed with others before being relayed to the receiving address, hiding the connection between the sender and recipient.In February 2023, the Sinbad Bitcoin mixer was revealed to be the rebrand of the Blender Bitcoin mixer, which was previously shut down by federal regulators. By November, Sinbad was also offline as the website was seized by law enforcement.Perhaps the most well-known mixer, Tornado Cash, was shut down in August 2022 after the US Treasury Department added the Ethereum mixing service to its Specially Designated Nationals list, effectively banning American citizens from using the tool or transacting with its addresses.A representative for Trezor, and Samourai Wallet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

South Korea's Evolving Donation Laws: A Delicate Balancing Act | Coin Insider


Key Takeaways:Encouraging philanthropy: South Korea has actively promoted philanthropy by providing donors with tax incentives and other benefits. These incentives aim to stimulate charitable giving and support various social causes, ranging from education and healthcare to environmental conservation.Transparency and accountability: The evolving laws also emphasise transparency and accountability in donation practices. This includes increased scrutiny of charitable organisations to ensure funds are used appropriately and effectively. Preventing corruption: Amidst efforts to encourage philanthropy, South Korea remains vigilant in avoiding corruption and misuse of donated funds. Stricter regulations and oversight mechanisms are being implemented to combat fraudulent activities and ensure that donations serve their intended purposes.South Korea’s legal landscape concerning cryptocurrency donations has been a topic of keen interest, particularly as digital assets continue to gain a position in the country’s financial ecosystem.The Ministry of Public Administration has revealed that some amendments to South Korea’s Donations Act have been filed but restrict the use of crypto assets for donation. Naver, a Korean internet giant, suggested that starting from July 2024, those who wish to donate to charitable organisations or causes can use various new methods, including department store gift vouchers, stocks and loyalty points, but not crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC). The latest update to donation laws showcases a nuanced approach, signalling both recognition of the growing significance of cryptocurrencies and the need for regulatory prudence.   Striking a Balance Between Innovation and ControlIn recent years, South Korea has grappled with how to regulate cryptocurrencies effectively. While the government acknowledges the potential benefits of blockchain technology and digital assets, concerns over money laundering, tax evasion, and investor protection have led to a cautious approach. This balancing act is evident in the updated donation laws, which stop short of fully embracing cryptocurrencies but acknowledge their existence within the donation framework. In 2006, the act on the collection and use of donated goods was first enacted with fewer types of payment methods and smartphones widespread. Under the revised laws, traditional forms of donation, such as cash and securities, remain the primary means of philanthropic contribution. This recognition provides greater clarity for individuals and organisations wishing to donate cryptocurrencies, offering legitimacy to such transactions. Methods of donations were expanded from bank transfers and online methods to include automated response systems, postal services and logistics services. Despite this acknowledgement, South Korea must fully integrate cryptocurrencies into its donation laws. The decision reflects a desire to tread carefully in an area fraught with regulatory uncertainty. By maintaining a cautious stance, policymakers aim to mitigate potential risks associated with crypto donations while allowing for innovation and adaptation in the philanthropic sector.Navigating the Complexities of Crypto DonationsIncluding cryptocurrencies in South Korea’s donation laws brings many challenges and considerations. One primary concern is the volatility inherent in digital asset markets. Unlike traditional forms of donation, such as cash or securities, cryptocurrencies can experience significant price fluctuations over short periods. Despite its popularity, South Korea’s Ministry did not provide reasoning for excluding digital asset donations; the legislation is set to permit donations in local government-issued KRW-pegged stablecoins and blockchain-issued gift vouchers. This volatility introduces risk for donors and recipients, potentially impacting the value of donations received.The nature of blockchain transactions presents challenges for regulatory oversight and compliance. While cryptocurrencies offer certain advantages, such as increased transparency and efficiency, they also present opportunities for illicit activities, including money laundering and terrorist financing. South Korea reported that in late April, it aimed to promote its temporary crime investigative unit into an official department to tackle the increasing number of crypto-related crimes. Policymakers must navigate these complexities carefully, implementing measures to mitigate risks without stifling innovation in the crypto space. Another consideration is the tax treatment of crypto donations. TheGivingBlock, a market that local charities would not be permitted to take, suggested that more than $2 billion is estimated to have been donated globally using crypto as of January 2024. While South Korea has made strides in clarifying digital assets’ regulatory framework, questions remain regarding the tax implications of donating cryptocurrencies. Clear guidance is essential to ensure compliance with tax laws and prevent potential misunderstandings between donors, recipients, and tax authorities. It has been reported that more than half of American charities accept donations for digital assets across the pond. The Future of Crypto Donations in South KoreaAs South Korea grapples with the regulatory challenges posed by cryptocurrencies, the future of crypto donations in the country remains to be determined. While the updated donation laws represent a step forward in recognising the legitimacy of digital assets within the philanthropic sector, further clarity and guidance are needed to realise their potential fully. Moving forward, policymakers must collaborate with industry stakeholders to develop robust regulatory frameworks that balance innovation with investor protection and financial integrity. This may involve implementing measures to enhance transparency and oversight within the crypto space while providing clear guidance on tax treatment and compliance requirements for crypto donations.

Robinhood to challenge SEC's notice over crypto operations


Robinhood Markets Inc. is contesting a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which could lead to enforcement action against its cryptocurrency division, Robinhood Crypto (RHC).



The notice hints at possible securities law violations, but Robinhood maintains that its crypto listings do not constitute securities. 



The SEC’s Wells Notice received by Robinhood raises issues with RHC’s crypto listings, custody practices, and overall platform operations. 



Robinhood, a popular trading app for stocks and cryptocurrencies, could face injunctions, disgorgement, or civil money penalties. 

	
	
	
	


Robinhood has expressed a readiness to engage with the SEC’s investigation and has sought clearer regulatory guidance through previous registration efforts.



“We firmly believe that the assets listed on our platform are not securities and we look forward to engaging with the SEC to make clear just how weak any case against Robinhood Crypto would be on both the facts and the law,” Dan Gallagher, chief legal, compliance and corporate affairs officer, said in a statement on Monday.



The SEC’s focus on Robinhood is part of a broader pattern of regulatory trend, with similar actions by the agency against other crypto entities such as Uniswap and Coinbase. 



Robinhood’s crypto division has previously paid a US$30 million fine to the New York Department of Financial Services for violations related to anti-money laundering and consumer protection.

Tether Partners With Chainalysis To Boost Compliance and Monitor Sanctioned Addresses - The Daily Hodl


								Stablecoin issuer Tether is working with blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis to develop a solution for monitoring transactions involving entities beyond those that directly buy and sell USDT.
In a statement, Tether says the customizable solution for monitoring secondary market activities will offer an enhanced understanding and oversight of the USDT market. 










The company says compliance professionals and investigators can use the platform as a source of intelligence for identifying wallets that pose risks or may be associated with illicit and sanctioned addresses.
Tether adds that the platform’s suite of tools includes “Sanctions Monitoring,” which lists addresses and transactions involving sanctioned entities, and “Categorizations” which can break down USDT holders by type.
The solution also includes a tool for “Largest Wallet Analysis,” which gives an in-depth examination of significant USDT holders and their activities, and an “Illicit Transfers Detector” that can help in identifying transactions that may be associated with illicit categories.
Says Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino,
“Our collaboration with Chainalysis marks a pivotal step in our ongoing commitment to establishing transparency and security within the cryptocurrency industry.”
The development comes following a report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in January that alleged money launderers and fraudsters in East and Southeast Asia prefer to use Tether’s USDT in their illegal activities.
Blockchain intelligence company TRM Labs also reported that USDT was the most used dollar-pegged token for illicit transactions in 2023.
Tether previously said its collaboration with law enforcement authorities and the monitoring of USDT make the stablecoin an impractical choice for illicit transactions.

Sell Bitcoin In May And Go Away? Here's How How You Could Have Pocketed A 1,449% Cumulative Return - Benzinga

Coinbureau co-founder Nic Puckrin shared how a “sell in May and go away” strategy would have done for Bitcoin BTC/USD.What Happened: In a thread on X, Puckrin pointed out compelling statistics on the historical performance of Bitcoin. Over the past five years, buying Bitcoin in October and selling in April has yielded cumulative returns of 1,449%. In contrast, buying in May and selling in September has resulted in a loss of 29%. The question on everyone’s mind is whether the chart will see a similar pattern this year.“Sell in May, Go Away” is an old adage from TradFi which refers to the effect of seasonality."Daily trading volume & volatility has fallen to 2-month lows and futures premiums have fallen to 3-month lows," Puckrin writes, adding that other factors like institutions are less bullish. Moreover, retail sentiment is fading, and the Fear & Greed index is in neutral territory, with Bitcoin search trends heading lower.Also Read: Bitcoin At A Reversal Point? Trader Sees These 3 ‘Key Areas Of Interest’Why It Matters: The worsening macro environment and the fading "pivot play" are driving liquidity away from the markets in general. Puckrin suggests that a saving grace could be the draining of the Treasury General Account, which could provide risk assets with a liquidity injection of up to $1.4 trillion, as recently theorized by Arthur Hayes.Whether the Treasury decides to provide this much-needed stimulus depends on various factors, such as the labor market, GDP growth,and the administration’s desire to win the upcoming election.If historical patterns hold true, a cooling off period could be witnessed in the crypto market over the next few months.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Why Michael Saylor Sees Bitcoin As ‘Apex Property Of The Human Race’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

GNUS Discord hack causes $1.27M in losses

Genius (GNUS) artificial intelligence network lost approximately $1.27 million through a token-minting exploit on May 5. The GNUS team announced plans to release a new version of the token and that users should no longer buy the old version.Source: GNUS.GNUS is a blockchain network that allows users to perform artificial intelligence (AI) computations in exchange for tokens.Related: AI Blockchain platforms attracted $5 billion in funding in Q1 2024According to a May 6 post from blockchain security firm CertiK, the attacker pulled off the exploit by gaining the private key to the team’s account that begins with 0x18. Once they had control of this account, they copied the token’s “salt” data from Ethereum, allowing them to use the Axelar bridge protocol to create a Fantom network version of the token. After that, 100 million fake GNUS tokens were minted, bridged to Ethereum, and sold into the market. The resulting price crash transferred the wealth of existing tokenholders to the attacker, as the attacker received real assets in exchange for tokens that were created out of thin air.Source: CertiK.In a May 5 post on social media platform X, GNUS CEO “SuperGenius” claimed that the 0x18 account was compromised when an attacker gained access to the team’s private Discord communications, stating, “Apparently the hackers can watch private messages on discord.” SuperGenius stated that as a “quick fix,” the team will deposit $500,000 worth of Ether (ETH) from their own funds into a liquidity pool for the new token once it is launched. In addition, the team will deposit $500,000 worth of fees they are owed but that are currently locked until February 2025. This is a total of $1 million in compensation.CertiK estimated that $1.25 million was lost in the exploit, which implies that the initial distribution of funds will cover 80% of losses.Blockchain networks continue to experience exploit risks. However, some evidence indicates that these attacks may be declining as security practices improve. In April, Crypto users suffered the fewest amount of losses from exploits since 2021, according to an April 30 report from CertiK.

                        The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) received a report from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) alleging that its cybersecurity program was lacking just two weeks before the commission’s X account was hacked on January 9, according to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett.SEC Received OIG Report Two Weeks Before X Hack
Eleanor Terret tweeted on May 6 about the issue, highlighting a December 2023 OIG report, an independent evaluation by contractor Cotton & Company Assurance and Advisor concluded that the federal regulator fell short of “effectively mitigating security weaknesses.” “To improve the SEC’s information security program, we urge management to take action to address areas of potential risk identified in this report,” the report read.The nearly 30-page document highlighted a list of much-needed improvements to the SEC’s security protocols, including maintaining its vulnerability disclosure policy and logging meeting requirements.“I am pleased your report identified improvements to SEC’s information security program across several domains, such as risk management, supply chain, security training, and continuous diagnostics and monitoring,” the SEC’s Chief Information Officer David Bottom said in a December 2023 letter to OIG. “The SEC’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) continues to focus on improving maturity throughout the program, even though not all metrics are evaluated and scored each year.”After receiving OIG’s report on its underperforming security program, the federal agency was ordered to submit an action plan within 45 days. The SEC was hacked shortly after on January 9 when an authorized party gained access to the commission’s X account and posted a fake spot Bitcoin ETF approval announcement.Cybersecurity Program Questioned Following Report
According to CoinDesk, the hack resulted in $90 million in liquidations, prompting market manipulation concerns.“Deeply concerned with this alleged hack of the SEC’s Twitter account,” Congresswoman Anne Wagner stated. “This is clear market manipulation that impacted millions of investors. I plan to get more answers from Chair Gensler on this incident.”The federal agency was later found to have not enabled two-factor authentication, allowing an unknown party to access the commission accounts via a SIM-swapping attack.“Access to the phone number occurred via the telecom carrier, not via SEC systems,” the SEC said in a statement shortly following the hack. “SEC staff have not identified any evidence that the unauthorized party gained access to SEC systems, data, devices, or other social media accounts.”Despite its obvious vulnerabilities, it is unclear if or when the federal commission will face reprimand for the incident.

Tom Brady Roasted For Cryptocurrency Investment In Netflix Special: 'Tom, How Did You Fall For That? Even Gronk Was Like-Me Know That's Not Real Money' - Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) - Benzinga

Legendary NFL quarterback Tom Brady was roasted by former teammates, comedians and friends during a live Netflix NFLX streaming special Sunday.Among the topics discussed were Brady's career, unwillingness to retire, his divorce from Gisele Bündchen and various NFL controversies like "Deflategate." The topic of cryptocurrency drew one of the biggest reactions from the crowd and social media.What Happened: Brady previously served as a brand ambassador for cryptocurrency trading platform FTX. The company, once valued at $32 billion, announced bankruptcy in 2022 and rattled the cryptocurrency market.Brady's endorsement of FTX and investment in the company was involved in several jokes during Sunday's live "The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady" event on Netflix.The event took place at the Kia Forum in California."You're saying ‘Guys, why didn't we go to the Crypto.com Arena downtown?'" roast host Kevin Hart said.Hart said the reason was to not remind fans about Brady's past cryptocurrency experiences."He f***ed those people…F***ed ‘em good, didn't he."Comedian Nikki Glaser also got in a zing on Brady and his past relationship with FTX."Tom also lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that? I mean, even Gronk was like me know that's not real money," Glaser said, referencing Brady's former teammate Rob Gronkowski who is often made fun of for his intelligence.The joke was met with a roar of laughter from the crowd and also on stage from several participants including Hart and Gronkowski. Social media quickly shared the joke and called it one of the best from the roast.Related Link: Tom Brady Grapples With Sam Bankman-Fried FTX Betrayal: ‘He Tricked Me, I’m Angry’Why It's Important: Brady is one of several celebrities associated with FTX that has been named in lawsuits.Brady was paid a reported $30 million for his partnership with the company. The investment, which consisted of equity in the company, has been made mostly worthless after the collapse of FTX.The NFL great previously had "laser eyes" on his X, formerly known as Twitter, profile picture. In November 2022, Brady removed the picture, which came after FTX declared bankruptcy and more than 550 days after sporting the pro-Bitcoin BTC/USD look.During the roast of Brady, many memorable topics were covered, including his promotion of FTX—a subject the former NFL quarterback would likely prefer to forget, given the company’s troubled history.Read Next: Brady, Bündchen, Kraft And This Billionaire Hedge Fund Manager Hold FTX Shares: Here’s How MuchPhoto: Shutterstock

Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) Jumps 225% and Prepares for New 3,000% Rally, As Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, has been attracting significant investment from early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.



Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) has surged around 225% in the first few hours since its launch,  delivering huge returns for early investors and attracting investment from early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, DOCPEPE still has plenty of potential to rise more, and it’s poised to rally another 3,000% in the coming 48 hours.



Furthermore, it has already been announced that the token will soon be listed on MEXC – as its first listing on a centralized exchange – and this will be another massively bullish event for its price.



Despite the rally so far, DOCPEPE still just has a market cap of around $34,000, meaning it has immense potential for more gains in the coming days and weeks.




Currently, Doctor Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DOCPEPE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for DOCPEPE by entering its contract address – 3n8HMVVfMF2uqdpts5TUETAHUrvD1AFg8V1XLahpeTT8 – in the receiving field.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Bitcoin distribution 'danger zone' over, analysts say

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rose above the $65,000 mark on May 6 as analysts argue that the post-halving "danger zone" may be over with more BTC upside on the way.Bitcoin out of the post-halving 'danger zone' – analystBitcoin’s post-halving "danger zone" is a three-week window after the halving, historically associated with downside volatility occurring below the re-accumulation range.With Bitcoin rising above the current re-accumulation range of approximately $60,000, the post-halving danger zone may be over, according to popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital. He wrote in a May 6 post:“Time-wise the post-Halving "Danger Zone" will continue for the remainder of this week, to see out its third final week in this post-Halving window. However, price-wise the anticipated effect has already occurred.”BTC/USD chart.

Bitcoin has since rebounded strongly to the upside… The Bitcoin Post-Halving "Danger Zone" is over.”Meanwhile, Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo also expects higher BTC prices based on the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP), a popular oscillator used by traders to determine the average asset price based on price action and volume.

Katz told Cointelegraph:“The completion of distribution by long-term holders at the $70,000 mark could indeed alleviate some sell pressure in the market. This scenario might contribute to a more stable environment and provide new investors with a clearer path for growth.”However, Bitcoin could remain subdued in the short-term, due to concerns over inflation and dampened expectations for rate cuts, according to Mithil Thakore, the CEO of Velar, a Bitcoin-native liquidity protocol. Thakore told Cointelegraph:“Last week's decision by the Federal Reserve to maintain interest rates at two-decade highs, while signaling potential future reductions, adds complexity to the market landscape. Considering these factors, short-term consolidation below the previous all-time high is conceivable.”After the current short-term consolidation, Thakore expects Bitcoin price to reach $100,000 before the end of 2024. He said: “The latter part of 2024 holds promise for Bitcoin. Anticipated interest rate reductions, renewed demand in ETFs, and advancements in Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions may fuel a resurgence, potentially propelling Bitcoin to new all-time highs and the coveted $100,000 milestone.”Related: ‘Mr. 100’ buys the Bitcoin dip for the first time since halving — Is the BTC bottom in?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Here’s How Solana Can Outpace BNB and USDT: Franklin Templeton - DailyCoin


        
Increased DEX volumes and network fees on Solana suggest a growing user base.



The deployment of Firedancer is expected to improve Solana’s network performance.



Upcoming airdrops and continuous meme coin activity boost Solana.
Following the near collapse after the FTX bankruptcy in late 2022, Solana saw a remarkable recovery. The token rose 580.44% from $21 last year to $154.25, where it is today, at times taking third place among crypto assets. This is now noted by major analysts, who predict it could rise further. According to a recent analysis by Franklin Templeton, Solana is positioned to go even beyond, taking third place in Binance Coin (BNB) and USDT for good. The analysis breaks down the key factors behind Solana’s success.  What’s Behind Solana’s Rise? Research firm Franklin Templeton released a report detailing Solana’s prospects after the recovery from the FTX collapse and its potential trajectory going forward. According to the firm, its rise was ushered by surging volumes on decentralized exchanges (DEX). Notably, these went from $1.1 billion in November 2023 to $35.2 billion by April 2024. 
Airdrops within its ecosystem significantly boosted this turnaround. Projects like Jito and Pyth created a billion-dollar wealth effect. In effect, their airdrops rewarded Solaan holders with free tokens that would later be worth billions. The airdrops increased investor interest in these tokens and in Solana as a whole. The report states Solana was well-positioned to benefit from these drops, thanks to its tech advantage. Unlike Ethereum, its low fees and high speeds enable even less tech-savvy investors to benefit from airdrops without paying exorbitant gas fees. The introduction of Firedancer, a new validator client by Jump Crypto, will likely boost these advantages. Crucially, the upgrade enhances data throughput and maximizes the utilization of client hardware, leading to lower costs for validators. Can Solana Overtake BNB and USDT? Solana has overtaken BNB several times before, particularly during periods of significant market momentum. Most recently, Solana flipped BNB in February and March 2024, driven by strong momentum in memecoin trading. However, once the markets cooled down, BNB was back on top. 
However, Franklin Templeton expects future airdrops to cement Solana’s position, potentially even putting it in third place. This would make SOL overtake Tether, only trailing Bitcoin and Ethereum. These insights could partially explain why Solana investors aren’t as concerned with some of the issues, including the ongoing network congestion. Moreover, the billions of tokens held by FTX could also create a headwind in the long term. However, for now, these tokens are locked up, and investors seem confident in SOL’s prospects, at least in the near future. On the Flipside
Memecoins, which have contributed to Solana’s success, are notoriously volatile. A drop in enthusiasm for memecoins could bring down Solana. 



Solana has suffered from several high-profile network outages. The recent congestion issues add to concerns over network stability. 
Why This MattersSolana’s rise is not just important for traders. A higher market cap can also attract more developers to Solana. This could boost the number and quality of decentralized applications (dApps) on Solana, strengthening its ecosystem.Read more about Solana’s prospects against BNB: Solana Takes 4th from BNB: What Happened and Will It Stick?Read more about Solana’s latest technical performance: Solana Enters Buy Territory On Major Crypto Market Rebound

XRP Facing Bearish Pattern as Price Spikes


The XRP chart has recorded the bearish divergence pattern on its 60-minute chart, according to the 100eyes Crypto Scanner.This pattern is based on the relationship between the price of the cryptocurrency and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) oscillator, which is used to determine whether or not a certain asset is oversold.  The bearish divergence pattern occurs when the price of a certain cryptocurrency (or any other asset) reaches new highs while the oscillator reaches a lower high. Bearish divergence can indicate a price downtrend since it typically signals waning bullish momentum. In this case, XRP recorded a lower high on the oscillator after surging higher earlier today. Popular trader Mikybull recently predicted that things are about to get "interesting" for XRP given that the breakout of the current RSI resistance level appears to be imminent. XRP gains against Bitcoin According to CoinGecko data, XRP is currently up by almost 4%, which makes it one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies over the past 24 hours alongside Solana (SOL). Earlier this Monday, the controversial cryptocurrency peaked at $0.5671. In the meantime, Bitcoin is down 1.3% over the same period of time. XRP has gained roughly 5% against this Bitcoin. This lack of correlation has puzzled some members of the community given that there's no new legal developments in the SEC v. Ripple case. It is worth noting that the Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency has seen nine consecutive months in the red. It remains to be seen whether it will manage to outperform the crypto king this May to finally break this disastrous streak.

                        A Bitcoin wallet has become active again after 10 years of dormancy. On May 6, it transferred 687.33 BTC to undisclosed wallet addresses, leading to selloff speculation within the cryptocurrency community.According to the blockchain tracker and analytics platform Whale Alert, the Bitcoin whale moved $43.893 million worth of BTC to two wallet addresses.The Awakening of Dormant Bitcoin Wallets ContinuesOne transaction involved the transfer of 625.42 BTC, valued at $41 million, while the other involved the transfer of 61.9 BTC, equivalent to approximately $2.89 million at press time.Bitcoin Wallet transferred 687.33 BTC to two undisclosed addresses.The Bitcoin whale had been inactive for over 10 years after initially receiving the Bitcoin on January 12, 2014, when the cryptocurrency traded at $917 per coin. The value of the whale’s whole reserve at that time was $630,000. At press time, BTC is worth $63.8K, highlighting an incredible profit of 6,875%.The reactivated Bitcoin wallet can be traced back to the Satoshi era – the early days after the creation of Bitcoin, when its pseudonymous founder, Nakamoto, was active online in forums. Some Satoshi-era wallets are often speculated to be linked to Satoshi himself.This is not the first time Bitcoin Whales will make staggering transfers after many years of dormancy.Satoshi-era Bitcoin whales reportedly transferred $230 million worth of BTC in November 2023 after six years of inactivity. This was after a Bitcoin wallet containing 1,005 BTC mined in 2010 was reactivated in August 2023 and transferred the long-dormant coins to new addresses in a series of transactions. According to the wallet statement, the 1,005 BTC was valued at just $328 when it was received in 2010.As previously reported on Crypto News, the fifth-richest Bitcoin Whale moved over $6 billion worth of BTC to three new addresses after 10 years of dormancy.On April 15, another dormant Bitcoin wallet became active for the first time in almost 14 years. The Bitcoin Whale moved 50 BTC to Coinbase, marking a profit of over $3 million on coins that were once worth less than a penny each.Meanwhile, the sudden activation of this dormant Bitcoin wallet has raised concerns about a potential selloff. It is speculated that the Bitcoin Whale may have chosen to liquidate a large portion of BTC holdings amidst the recent Bitcoin price fluctuations.Some crypto traders believe the awakening is likely associated with early miners or buyers just trying to make a profit, while others are cautious about the impact of such a large transaction on the market.1.75 million Bitcoin Wallet Remains Dormant
According to a Fortune report, approximately 1.75 million Bitcoin wallets have been inactive for over a decade. These wallets collectively hold 1,798,681 BTC, valued at about $121 billion.The rise of dormant wallets can be attributed to Bitcoin’s price history. In its early days, the cryptocurrency was nearly worthless, only surpassing the $1 mark in 2011. As a result, many individuals who received Bitcoin may have forgotten about it or failed to secure the private keys required to access their wallets.This lack of key security was especially prevalent before 2012, when services like Coinbase, which now manages private keys on behalf of users, were not yet established.Not all dormant wallets were lost or abandoned, however. A survey data from Chainalysis suggests that old wallets will continue to reactivate steadily but slowly until the number of lost Bitcoins stabilizes, estimated to be around 1.5 million coins.

Over $3 Billion in Vested Crypto Assets Set to Unlock in May, Highlighting Major Releases by Sui and Pyth Network



                    

Over $3.1 billion in vested crypto assets are scheduled for release in May, highlighting significant events for projects like Sui and Pyth Network, each set to unlock over $1 billion in tokens. 



Crypto vesting practices help ensure ongoing commitment to projects by restricting the immediate sale of tokens by early investors or team members.




Sui, a layer-1 blockchain platform, is poised to release the highest volume of tokens. 



It plans to unlock nearly one billion tokens valued at approximately $1.15 billion for its Series A and Series B investors, early contributors, the Mysten Labs treasury, and its community reserve on May 31.



Pyth Network, a market data platform, will unlock over two billion tokens valued around $1.1 billion on May 20. 




These tokens are allocated for protocol development, ecosystem growth, publisher rewards, and private sale investors, with the price per PYTH token currently about $0.51.



Additionally, other crypto projects like Avalanche, Aptos, Arbitrum, Starknet, Optimism, and Immutable are set to release over $700 million in combined tokens. 



Specifically, on May 12, Aptos will release 11.3 million APT tokens worth $101 million to various stakeholders including its foundation and core contributors.

Avalanche plans to unlock 9.5 million AVAX tokens valued at $321 million on May 22 for its strategic partners and team, among others.



Arbitrum, another layer-2 blockchain network, will release $95 million worth of ARB tokens on May 16, designated for its team and investors. 



This follows a substantial $2.3 billion token release by Arbitrum to the same groups earlier in March.



Moreover, Starknet is scheduled to unlock $84 million in tokens for its investors and early contributors on May 15. 



Immutable will follow with a $56 million release on May 17 aimed at supporting ecosystem and project development.



Lastly, the layer-2 scaling solution Optimism will release 24.1 million OP tokens on May 29, valued at approximately $70 million. 



In May 2023, Optimism had also unlocked $587 million in OP tokens for its early contributors and investors, underscoring a recurring theme of substantial token releases in the crypto industry.

Jack Dorsey Ditching Bluesky Fosters Censorship Tech Rumors - DailyCoin


        
Jack Dorsey announced his departure from Bluesky.



Rumors are circulating about Dorsey’s motives for leaving.



Bluesky’s vision was to achieve uncensorable social media. 
Bluesky is pitched as a decentralized social media platform, and Jack Dorsey’s chance at redemption follows the mess Twitter had become at the time of his departure. However, just as Bluesky was making progress, including opening its platform to the public in February 2024, Dorsey surprised everyone by stating he had cut ties with the company.Dorsey’s abrupt departure from Bluesky, a project he once championed as the path to censor-free social media, has sent the rumor mill into overdrive regarding his motives for leaving.Jack Dorsey’s Shock Bluesky DepartureJack Dorsey surprised his millions of followers recently by declaring that he had left the board of directors at Bluesky, the decentralized social media platform he had previously backed. The admission sparked an outpouring of questions about Dorsey’s motives for abandoning a project he had once described as “an open decentralized standard for social media.” 
The revelation came in a tweet thread where Dorsey signaled his willingness to make “long term grants for open protocols,” following his recent $21 million donation to OpenSats, a charity that funds Bitcoin-related and open-source technologies. Notably, Dorsey had donated $10 million to OpenSats around a year ago to the day, demonstrating his consistent financial backing of open source and decentralized projects. However, his willingness to pour substantial sums into such initiatives while simultaneously departing Bluesky’s board has prompted speculation on his motives for leaving the Twitter spinoff and whether Bluesky has somehow deviated from its founding unbiased, decentralized vision.
Adding fuel to the rumor mill, Dorsey posted a tweet several hours after disclosing his Bluesky departure, cautioning that individuals should not rely on companies to grant freedom. Instead, he advocated fighting for freedom through “freedom technology,” citing X as one such tool. While Dorsey did not expand on his Bluesky departure, reading between the lines may infer that the company failed to achieve its unbiased, decentralized social media promise. Bluesky originated in 2019 as a Twitter project to explore decentralized social media’s viability. Although it received $13 million in funding from Twitter, Bluesky claimed to operate independently from the outset. The initial research delved into decentralized concepts like “self-authenticating protocols” that could incorporate scalability and trust.By the time Bluesky went live as an invite-only platform in February 2023, devs had opted to go with the “AT” protocol, which offers a means of creating a federated, decentralized social network. Yet, the project has faced criticism over its UI similarity to X in terms of look and feel.By early 2022, Elon Musk had openly declared his intention to buy Twitter as a response to the censorship and perceived left-leaning bias plaguing the platform. This set the stage for Bluesky to flourish as an independent, decentralized alternative potentially, but Dorsey’s departure casts doubt on where the platform goes from here. On the Flipside
Since Musk took control, the number of X users has dropped by around 33 million to 336 million. 



Dorsey‘s reputation as a freedom lover was particularly strained following the banning of Donald Trump from X, who was a sitting president at the time.



Trump’s account was reinstated under Musk, but the former president created his own Truth Social platform.
Why This MattersWhile there are no clear answers on Dorsey’s motives for leaving Bluesky, the issue has rehashed the circumstances around the Twitter buyout and the ongoing influence of three letter agencies on social media.US authorities probe Block following allegations of violating sanctions.Jack Dorsey’s Block Lands Under Federal InvestigationCrypto.com celebrates landmark user count, but how does it compare to rivals?Crypto.com Hits 100M Users: How It Stacks Up Against Rivals

Litecoin Whales Buy Big Despite Bearish Price: Rebound Soon?


								On-chain data suggests Litecoin whales have participated in buying recently despite the fact that the asset’s price has been finding struggle.
Litecoin Whales Accumulated 100,000 LTC Recently
As pointed out by an X user using data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the LTC whales have recently bought while the cryptocurrency’s price has declined.
The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the total amount of Litecoin that the different wallet groups in the market are holding right now.

Addresses or investors are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins they are carrying in their balance currently. The 1-10 coins group, for instance, includes holders owning at least 1 and at most 10 LTC.
In the context of the current topic, the whale cohort is of interest. These entities may be defined as the addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 LTC. At the current exchange rate, the lower bound of the range converts to about $820,000, while the upper one to around $8.2 million.
Clearly, these holdings are quite sizeable, due to which the whales are considered influential beings on the network. As such, their behavior may be something to watch for, since it could end up reflecting on the market in some form.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of the Litecoin whales over the past month or so:

The value of the metric seems to have been heading up in recent days | Source: Santiment on X
As is visible in the graph, the Litecoin Supply Distribution for the investors holding between 10,000 and 100,000 LTC has observed an increase recently. More specifically, the metric went up by around 100,000 LTC ($8.2 million) between April 28 and May 4.
This net accumulation spree from the whales seems to have come alongside a decline in the price of the cryptocurrency. A similar trend also occurred last month, where these large investors had participated in significant buying alongside the crash.
Back then, these holders had also first done some selling, potentially paving the way for the price decline in the first place. This time around, though, there wasn’t any notable net distribution from the whales prior to the drawdown.
Interestingly, the whale buying reaction had come at similar sub-$80 prices following both of these drawdowns, so it would appear that these investors believe the cryptocurrency to be a worthy buy at these prices, at least in the long-term.

Naturally, so long as the bullish sentiment among these influential entities remains, Litecoin could be able to see a recovery push. This indicator could be to keep an eye on in the near future, though, as if these investors take to selling instead, then more drawdown could rather follow for the asset.
LTC Price
Litecoin had started a recovery rally in the past day that had taken the coin back above $84, but it would appear that the run has fizzled out as LTC is now back under $82.

Whales Accumulate Chainlink, Pepe and Three Other Altcoins From Binance: Lookonchain - The Daily Hodl


								Whales reportedly had a field day over the weekend, gobbling up millions of dollars worth of digital assets from crypto exchange Binance.
Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says that on Saturday, crypto whales withdrew stacks of the decentralized oracle project Chainlink (LINK), meme token Pepe (PEPE), decentralized exchange Uniswap (UNI), stablecoin governance token Maker (MKR) and domain naming system Ethereum Name Service (ENS) out of the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume.










“Whales accumulated PEPE, LINK, UNI, MKR and ENS…
0x1A2E withdrew 322.48 billion PEPE ($2.78 million) from Binance [on May 4th].
aavebank.eth withdrew 500,000 UNI ($3.75 million), 183,799 LINK ($2.62 million), 171 MKR ($500,000) and 31,139 ENS ($483,000) from Binance [on May 4th].” 
Furthermore, Lookonchain finds that web3 investment firm DWF Labs transferred $2 million worth of the stablecoin USDC to a multi-sig safe wallet that already holds 10 million Polygon (MATIC) tokens.
Late last month, Lookonchain found that two whitelisted wallets printed staggering 30,080x gains on a meme asset built on Base, Coinbase’s Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 scaling solution.
Whitelisted crypto wallets are addresses that have been approved to participate in specific crypto events, such as initial coin offerings (ICOs).
The blockchain tracking firm noted that the wallets spent 0.034 ETH worth $102 to buy a combined 172.56 million BRETT (BRETT) in February. They later sold the BRETT for 890.65 ETH worth $3.14 million for massive gains.

Long-Term Bitcoin Investors Have Returned To HODLing: Report - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin’s sell pressure has waned dramatically compared to two months ago, with more long-term investors holding onto their BTC longer, according to crypto analytics firm Glassnode.Bitcoin’s “Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple” has undergone an “epic cooldown” over the past few weeks, according to lead Glassnode analyst James Check, returning the top cryptocurrency to accumulation mode.The on-chain metric compares near-term Bitcoin spending behavior to its yearly average, with a focus on coins that haven’t moved in a long time. The ratio rises when long-term holder selling is relatively high and falls as investors pivot back to HODLing.“This is essentially indicating that old coins have stopped moving on-chain, allowing breathing space for new demand bids to hit… well… a lack of supply,” Check wrote on Twitter on Monday. “Long-term holders need higher prices to motivate sales.”On-chain analysts say that large Bitcoin price corrections during a bull run are driven by long-term holders looking to cash out when the Bitcoin price rises substantially above the average price at which they bought in.While the total long-term holder supply generally rises over time, it has historically fallen precipitously during Bitcoin’s largest bull runs, such as in early 2021 as well as early 2024.Extremes in the VDD Multiple—greater than 2.9—have proven effective at identifying local and absolute tops in a Bitcoin bull market, Glassnode’s data shows, including the 2017 peak during the network’s third halving epoch. Back in March, the ratio re-entered extreme territory over 4.0 but has now fallen to less than 1.4.A similar cooldown can be observed in long-term holder spending as a percentage of Bitcoin’s total supply.“It decreased from almost 5% in March to 2% in April, indicating that long-term holders stopped spending in April,” said CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno told Decrypt.Late last week, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju claimed that active Bitcoin whales had absorbed 47,000 BTC over 24 hours after Bitcoin’s price fell below $57,000 at the start of May. Check said at the time that the price drop looked like a standard bull market correction—and argued that it was a good time to buy the dip.Likewise, Bitcoin ETFs netted $379 million of inflows on Friday, breaking a seven-day streak of straight outflows and marking the best day for the nascent investment products in several weeks.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Top Trader Says Says One New Altcoin Project Set To Go Much Higher Amid ‘Reliable Setups’ In Market - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst believes one Ethereum (ETH)-based decentralized finance (DeFi) token is being set up for a large rally.
According to pseudonymous trader The Flow Horse, the governance token of Ethena (ENA) is one of many new altcoins presenting opportunities, but requires patience for payoff.










“There are a couple pairs that I am eyeing that are relatively new and have been going through their first longer-rounded pullbacks similar to ENA below.
Almost all new alts offer a very basic and reliable diagonal breakout setup if you are patient enough.
I think this is setting up to move much higher. Unlocks are still a year out.”
Source: The Flow Horse/X
According to another crypto analyst called Altcoin Sherpa, ENA appears likely to extend its upward momentum after retesting the Fibonacci retracement level at $0.76.
“ENA: I’m out of this one but I think it looks solid. .618 Fibonacci + support/resistance level and market looking ok.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Looking at the altcoin markets as a whole, another pseudonymous trader known as Rekt Capital tells his 461,000 followers on the social media platform X that the OTHERS chart, which tracks the market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding the 10 largest digital assets, is potentially gearing up for a bounce off the $250 billion level.
Based on his chart, the analyst appears to be initially targeting the $315 billion level before an eventual run to the old highs near $425 billion.
“Altcoin Market Cap is still holding the $250 billion well as support, positioning itself for a future move to the upside via the black pathway.”

ENA is worth $0.885 at time of writing, up 8% on the day.

Robinhood Receives Enforcement Notice From The SEC For Alleged Securities Violations ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Robinhood Crypto, the digital asset arm of the popular trading platform Robinhood Markets, has been served with a Wells Notice by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The securities regulator informed the company that it plans to file an enforcement action over alleged securities violations.



Robinhood said it’s determined to prove “just how weak any case against Robinhood Crypto would be on both the facts and the law.”



SEC Slaps Robinhood With Wells Notice



Robinhood received a Wells Notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 4, according to an 8K disclosure on Monday.



The notice indicates that the SEC is considering enforcement action against Robinhood’s crypto division for possible violations of Sections 15(a) and 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Simply put, the U.S. regulator believes Robinhood offers its customers crypto assets which it considers unregistered securities. 



The SEC has been investigating Robinhood’s crypto listings and crypto custodian operations and made the “preliminary determination” to recommend that the agency lodge an enforcement action related to the alleged securities violations.

&nbsp







Robinhood’s chief legal and compliance officer, Dan Gallagher, indicated that the notice comes despite the company cooperating with the SEC. He voiced disappointment over the issuance of the warning notice:



“After years of good faith attempts to work with the SEC for regulatory clarity, including our well-known attempt to ‘come in and register,’ we are disappointed that the agency has decided to issue a Wells Notice related to our US crypto business,” Gallagher posited.



Notably, in December 2022, the SEC issued an investigative subpoena regarding Robinhood’s crypto listings, cryptocurrency custody, and general platform operations. Robinhood Crypto currently allows New York investors to buy and sell 15 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu.



The top American financial cop has previously issued similar notices, warning about legal actions against crypto exchanges Coinbase, Binance, and Uniswap.



Confident In Regulatory Position



Gallagher, who previously served as an SEC commissioner from 2011 to 2015, said Robinhood is ready to prove to the SEC that their crypto listings are compliant and the cryptocurrencies they offer are not securities.



“We firmly believe that the assets listed on our platform are not securities and we look forward to engaging with the SEC to make clear just how weak any case against Robinhood Crypto would be on both the facts and the law,” he continued.



Neither the SEC nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has yet to issue clear-cut guidelines on what they view as securities and commodities in terms of crypto assets.



Currently, the only cryptocurrency that the SEC has publicly called a commodity is Bitcoin (BTC). Ethereum also held this status for years, until recently when the SEC Chair Gary Gensler hinted that the industry’s second-largest crypto might be deemed a security following its transition from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake security model.



On the contrary, the CFTC in March declared that Ether is a commodity alongside Bitcoin and Litecoin (LTC).

Tom Lee Doubles Down on $150,000 Bitcoin Price Call


During his Monday appearance on CNBC's "Squawk Box," Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee predicted that the price of Bitcoin is going to hit $150,000 in 2024.  According to Lee, Bitcoin is still early in its current bullish cycle. "The idea that it could get to $150,000 is still within our base case," he said.  The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading just above the $63,000 level after giving up some of its recent gains. As reported by U.Today, Lee opined that the market was being fooled by the April turmoil during a recent conversation with American investor Anthony Scaramucci. Earlier this year, the Fundstrat co-founder also spoke in detail about the transformative impact of Bitcoin ETFs, describing them as a "wonderful development" since they allow people to have exposure to the largest cryptocurrency without the need to store private keys.Lee believes that the price of Bitcoin could reach $500,000 within the next five years. Inflation to drop "dramatically" A week ago, the price of Bitcoin experienced a dramatic plunge due to stagflation fears triggered by worrying inflation data. The Fudndstrat co-founder, however, is convinced that inflation is going to decline "dramatically" this year in the US.  "I think inflation is going to sorta cool pretty dramatically," Lee said.  Lee cannot precisely predict when this dramatic drop in inflation is going to take place, but he expects this to happen in the second half of 2024. Lee does not think that the U.S. Federal Reserve is actually comfortable with long-term rates at these levels. He has explained that high rates are putting a lot of pressure on regional banking. "It's hurting their balance sheet. The cost of money is quite high, especially relative to the rest of the world."

Fresh Cryptocurrency Statements from CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam - Bitcoin Sistemi


Rostin Behnam, Chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), recently made a statement regarding the future of the cryptocurrency market.
He says he predicts we will witness another enforcement cycle in the crypto space in the next 6 to 24 months. According to Behnam, this is due to the lack of a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency sector, the appreciation of assets and the renewed interest of individual investors and entrepreneurs.


Behnam also said about the sustainability of digital assets: “There is a sustainability to this asset class. It is clear that there has been growth in the last six months, despite what happened in 2022.”

On the subject of crypto legislation, Behnam explained that bipartisan discussions are currently ongoing. “Bipartisan discussions are happening … slowly but naturally, and they are still ongoing,” he said.





Although Behnam acknowledges the legitimacy of the crypto asset class, he expects further enforcement actions due to a lack of regulatory clarity. “Given the legitimacy of this asset class aside,” Behnam said he expects there to be further enforcement action due to a lack of regulatory clarity.
At the end of his words, Behnam acknowledged that the market was growing and said: “Despite what happened in 2022, we have a growing market…”

Blast Ecosystem Surges on Novel “Jackpot” Incentive Structure - The Defiant

Blast tokens and NFTs can now be entered to win Blast Gold via its new Jackpot mechanism.Tokens in the Blast ecosystem are surging after the Ethereum Layer 2 announced its newest feature: Jackpot.Following the announcement Blast tokens immediately ran with PacMoonincreasing by over 30%, Juice Finance by roughly 40%, and notable NFTs such as Blastopians increased by nearly 50%. Ether and Bitcoin have remained mostly flat in that time.Despite the increase in prices across the ecosystem, Blast’s total TVL has only risen by 1.7% over the last 7 days, according to DeFiLlama.Blast GoldUsers can now submit their Blast tokens and NFTs into a jackpot for the chance to win a prize pool of Blast Gold, which is akin to points. Gold is one of two methods to farm the Blast airdrop, with 50% of the airdrop to be awarded to Blast points, and 50% to Blast Gold.Blast points can only be earned by holding ETH or USDB, and prior to the addition of the jackpot, Blast Gold could only be earned via ecosystem dApps. With the jackpot system, it can now be farmed by holding other assets in the ecosystem such as NFTs and memecoins. The additional incentives to hold these tokens has likely led to the price surge.Blast TweetNew ExperimentThe move is yet another experiment in the airdrops and points space, at a time when the dynamic has come under fire. Token distribution events by major projects including EigenLayer, Kamino Finance and Friend.Tech have spurred community backlash. Web3 projects are still trying to figure out how to balance incentives in a way that they can promote activity, while attracting long-term users, and in some cases, also complying with uncertain regulations.Blast’s mainnet went live in February this year. The Paradigm-backed L2 has proven to be controversial since it launched with a one-way deposit contract in November 2023. However, its total TVL has consistently increased since its launch to its current $1.5 billion, the fourth largest Layer 2, according to L2Beat.In Blast’s new jackpot design, users are required to submit their assets into a non-custodial deck that can hold up to eight different tokens or NFTs. At the conclusion of every block there is a small chance to hit the jackpot, and a random Blast asset will be selected as the winner. The “gold” will then be distributed to the deck of the asset owner and distributed on a percentage basis.Users have hit the jackpot twice since it began on Friday, with awards distributed to the PacMoon and Fantasy.Top communities. The value of Blast Gold is speculative, but is currently equal to roughly 37,000 Blast points, which is subject to change based on the supply of points and “gold.”

Sui Network Dispels ‘Shady’ Token Supply Allegations - DailyCoin


        
The Sui Network is facing scrutiny amid suspicions regarding its native SUI token supply.



The ecosystem recently marked a significant milestone, celebrating its first anniversary.



Sui has taken steps to address concerns regarding its token distribution.
Sui, the Layer-1 blockchain and smart contract platform dedicated to digital asset ownership, has been on a remarkable journey since its inception, marked by significant milestones achieved across its ecosystem. Building on the momentum, on May 3, 2034, Sui celebrated its first anniversary since its launch. However, the celebration was short-lived. Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons raised the alarm regarding perceived inconsistencies in the network’s token supply. In a bid to assure investors, Sui addressed the criticism.SUI Token Supply: Centralized or Not?In a tweet on May 4, 20224, the SUI network refuted the allegations that its token supply is centralized, describing them as misleading and inaccurate. 
Central to Bons’ apprehensions are questions about Sui’s token distribution, with claims that 80% of it is allocated to the network’s founders. Bons asserted that 160 million of SUI’s total 10 billion went to its “for-profit” creator, Mysten Labs. At the same time, another 600M was earmarked for “early contributors,” in addition to a significant 1.5B allocated to venture capitalists.Bons emphasized that this grants the founders control of most of the supply without lock-ins or legal guarantees, posing a significant risk to holders if dumped. Countering the claims, Sui emphasized that its creator, Mysten Labs, does not control the SuiFoundation treasury, the community reserve, stake subsidies, or any tokens allocated to investors.“Sui Foundation is the largest holder of locked tokens, which will be unlocked in accordance with the public emissions schedule,” stated the network, adding that “there is no mystery about token ownership. Every token that will be released has been allocated.”Reiterating its commitment to transparency, Sui affirmed that all staking rewards earned by the Sui Foundation are reinvested back into the community, which is also reflected in its public emission schedule.

Despite Sui’s assurances, market participants have labeled the network manipulative, intending to dump the token against retail investors.



While the SUI token has performed impressively in the past months, its ongoing underperformance has raised questions about its credibility, down approximately 30% in the last 30 days and 91% below its all-time high.



At press time, SUI is trading at $1.14, ticking a total 5.62% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin ETFs Are Back? $378 Million In Gains Marks Best Day In Over a Month - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsAfter a depressing few weeks of outflows, the tide may be turning for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs): On Friday, every single one of the relatively young investment products saw their cash flow turn positive for the first time ever. Data from Farside Investors shows that the unanimous turnaround was due to investors plugging more cash into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) than was pulled out of it since it became an ETF in January. The fund had experienced outflows every day as investors who couldn’t previously redeem shares did so, often in search of competitive funds with lower fees.But on Friday, GBTC grew by $63 million. This, combined with investors plugging cash into all of the other crypto funds, meant that a total of $378 million entered the collective Bitcoin ETF market that day. It represents a remarkable turnaround, as the investment vehicles had their worst day on record earlier last week when they bled over half a billion dollars. And that came after weeks of waning interest from investors in the products. The Securities and Exchange Commission in January approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs after a decade of applications. The funds allow ordinary investors to buy shares that track the price of the cryptocurrency via brokerage accounts. They were immediately and massively popular, with billions of dollars entering the funds. The explosion in ETF popularity is credited with driving up the price of Bitcoin, which in March touched a new all-time high of $73,747, according to CoinGecko.But the initial hype slowed down last month. Added to that, the Federal Reserve hinted that it was in no hurry to cut interest rates, and turbulence in the Middle East scared investors away from so-called “risk-on” assets like Bitcoin. Investors pulling money out of the funds puts downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin, which is now trading not only below its March all-time high but also under the 2021 record of $69,044.Friday brought a welcome reprieve. Could a sustained optimistic shift in investor sentiment push the coin’s price back up again?Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Price analysis 5/6: SPX, DXY, BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, TON, DOGE, ADA

Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed increased volatility last week. The price recovered from an intraweek low of about $56,500 to finish above $64,000, a marginal gain of roughly 1.5% over the previous week. This shows that the sentiment remains positive, and lower levels are being purchased by the bulls.According to Farside Investors data, the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded net inflows of $378 million on May 3. Particularly encouraging was the $63 million inflow into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, its first since its conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF in January. Although it is too early to tell, early signs suggest that the incessant selling in the GBTC could end.Daily cryptocurrency market performance.

Buyers may find it difficult to overcome this obstacle.However, if the bulls bulldoze their way above $162, the pair may accelerate toward $205. This level is likely to act as a formidable resistance.

Ethereum L2 EigenLayer is last of ‘life-changing airdrops,’ experts say

An ongoing, much-hyped airdrop conducted by Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer continues to generate controversy over its restrictive qualifications for claiming rewards. Project founders and users from across the crypto ecosystem are chiming in as a result. “The reality is that, in all likelihood, the era of life-changing airdrops is now behind us,” said Leandro Schlottchauer, co-founder and CEO of smart contract developer Kuyen Labs, in a statement. “It should be clear by now that no airdrop or similar incentive can satisfy all community members,” he continued, adding: "Community members have been divided on the core team’s plans, including the amount to be airdropped to early contributors and the limited number of jurisdictions from which users will be able to claim."Meanwhile, Mohak Agarwal, CEO and founder of liquid-staking protocol Claystack, said EigenLayer’s decision to announce its airdrop as a surprise is not a workable model for the long term. “While the mysterious approach may initially evoke excitement, it often leads to disappointment later on,” said Agarwal. “This pattern suggests a tendency for projects to announce a small airdrop supply initially, anticipating user disappointment, and then offering additional tokens to appease them — a short-term fix that isn’t sustainable in the long run.”In a surprise blog post on April 29, EigenLayer, the second-largest decentralized finance protocol with $15.67 billion in total value locked, unveiled its airdrop plans where among other items, only 5% of the initial token supply would be allocated to early users who participated in Season One. The remaining allocation would be distributed to users in the following “seasons.” In addition, users from 30 countries — including the United States, Canada, China and Russia — would not be able to claim EIGEN tokens.Countries excluded from the EigenLayer airdrop. Source: BonecondorThe announcement quickly drew widespread community condemnation. “Accepting stake from those countries and not rewarding them isn’t right. They took a very real risk for nothing,” wrote one user on social media platform X in response to the protocol’s geoblocking efforts. In response to community feedback, EigenLayer announced in a follow-up post on May 3 that they would airdrop an additional 28 million EIGEN to 280,000 wallets. Despite booming development activities within the crypto ecosystem, recent airdrops often failed to follow up on their initial traction. On April 4, cross-chain messaging platform Wormhole transferred $800 million worth of its W tokens to select users, with its post-airdrop valuation surging to a stunning $22 billion measured in fully diluted market capitalization. Since then, however, the token has lost more than 50% of its value and traded at $0.6457 at the time of publication.  Similarly, STRK, the native token of the Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution Starknet, has lost 43% of its value since its February airdrop. At the time, allegedly, 701,544 eligible wallets were controlled by airdrop farmers who claimed STRK tokens by creating duplicate developers’ accounts on GitHub. Cointelegraph previously reported that due to their popularity, airdrops have been frequently targeted by farm accounts and Sybil accounts, thereby allocating large swaths of tokens to otherwise unqualified accounts instead of to genuine ecosystem users. "As a result, a project’s reputation is damaged, its token supply inflates, and price manipulation may occur as a result of excessive dumping by airdrop farmers after the event is over," commented researchers at Gamic HQ regarding the practice. Related: EigenLayer users fume over restrictive airdrop, others say it’s ‘generous’

The SEC Can’t Stop Suing Crypto Companies

“Congress should enact new legislation to avoid legal pitfalls, but it’s unclear to me whether they actually will,” Baumann added. Gensler, for his part, has stated directly that he doesn’t think crypto needs bespoke legislation or guidance, given his view that everything crypto, bar bitcoin, walks and talks like securities.

Bitcoin and Ether Options Worth $2.4 Billion Set to Expire, Market Volatility Expected



                    

On May 3, options contracts for Bitcoin and Ether worth a combined total of $2.4 billion are set to expire, potentially escalating market volatility.



Bitcoin options are derivatives that let investors bet on Bitcoin’s price fluctuations without holding the actual cryptocurrency. 




These contracts are available in two forms: call and put options. 



Call options grant the right to buy Bitcoin at a predetermined price before a specific date, whereas put options provide the right to sell it at an agreed-upon price before the contract expires.



The put/call ratio is a common metric used by investors to gauge market mood. 




A dominance of put purchases suggests bearish sentiment, whereas more call buys imply a bullish outlook.



A put-to-call ratio below 0.7 signals bullish conditions, but a ratio above 1 indicates bearish sentiment.

According to data from the Deribit exchange, 23,367 Bitcoin contracts valued at $1.39 billion will expire on May 3. 




The put-to-call ratio for these Bitcoin options is currently 0.5, with a maximum pain point—a price level causing the most significant potential loss for the most holders—pegged at $61,000.



Additionally, 334,248 Ether contracts, representing a notional value of $1 billion, are due to expire shortly. 



These contracts have a put-to-call ratio of 0.37 and a maximum pain point set at $3,000.



Historically, the expiration of such contracts leads to transient fluctuations in the cryptocurrency spot market. 



In recent weeks, both Bitcoin and Ether have been under bearish pressure. 



Bitcoin’s value recently dropped below $60,000, a nearly 20% decline in a week following its halving event, while Ether dipped below $2,900. 



Typically, the market recovers from this expiry-induced volatility within a few days.

SEC goes after Robinhood; KangaMoon steady as market reacts - CoinJournal



                    

                    
SEC issued a Wells Notice againast Robinhood, alleging securities violations.
Crypto prices reacted lower, with Bitcoin (BTC) retreating to under $64,000.
KangaMoon (KANG), a new crypto project for play-to-earn and SocialFi, continued to attract investors.

Robinhood Markets Inc., the company behind the popular stock and crypto trading app, revealed it received a Wells Notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 4.
While the news impacted the crypto market, with Bitcoin dipping from intraday highs above $65,000, analysts are bullish on BTC and other top altcoins. There’s also a lot of positive vibes around new crypto project KangaMoon (KANG).
SEC slaps Robinhood with a Wells Notice
The crypto market reacted lower on Monday after news that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a Wells Notice to popular trading app Robinhood.
The SEC alleges securities violations against Robinhood Crypto. In response, the company says it is open to engaging with the regulator.
“We firmly believe that the assets listed on our platform are not securities and we look forward to engaging with the SEC to make clear just how weak any case against Robinhood Crypto would be on both the facts and the law,” Robinhood’s chief compliance officer Dan Gallagher said.
SEC’s notice to Robinhood Crypto and market reaction
The market’s response showed a broader concern and dismay, and Bitcoin price slipped from highs above $65,000 to trade near $63,300. In the stock market, Robinhood’s share price fell more than 5%.
Following this latest Wells Notice to Robinhood Crypto, the SEC is now either looking to sue or has active lawsuits against multiple crypto companies. These include exchanges Coinbase, Binance, Kraken; DEX platform Uniswap, and Ethereum development studio Consensys.
SEC’s approach to crypto regulation has drawn sharp criticism from industry players, with many seeing it as gross overreach on the regulator’s part.
Jake Chervinsky, the chief legal officer at Variant, says the SEC is “abusing the Wells process as a scare tactic now.”
KangaMoon (KANG) steady amid increased interest
While the SEC’s strategy in regulating cryptocurrencies has raised concerns amid calls for clarity, the crypto investment community knows the industry is here to stay and continue to build top projects.
It’s a scenario that has crypto investors bullish on the potential of a project like KangaMoon (KANG).
Offering a new play-to-earn gaming ecosystem that taps into the benefits of SocialFi, KangaMoon already stands out for its astounding presale performance. But aside from the surging interest, there’s real traction for its P2E gaming platform amid a robust community-driven approach and meme culture.
What’s attractive about the native KANG token is that with it, holders can earn more KANG during the presale. The token thus offers a chance to earn a return ahead of its listing on exchanges post the token sale.  
KangaMoon recently reached the $6 million milestone in its presale, with KANG token available to early birds at $0.0196 in Stage 5. 
Once the presale closes, KANG tokens will be available for trading, potentially exploding amid a broader market bull market performance.
Learn more about KangaMoon (KANG) on their website.

Four months in prison for CZ, another US state kicks out Binance.US: Law Decoded

A United States judge has sentenced former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao to four months in prison for violating U.S. money laundering laws. Prosecutors had recommended that the former Binance CEO serve three years for failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program while at the crypto exchange, to which he pleaded guilty. Judge Richard Jones said there was no evidence Zhao “was ever informed” of specific illegal activities at Binance, rebutting prosecutors’ request to increase the sentence from 18 months to three years.A four-month sentence and billions of dollars in fines may seem like a light punishment to U.S. authorities, who have been investigating the former executive and its crypto empire for the past six years.“General deterrence appears to be the main rationale behind the term of imprisonment,” Aaron Lane, a senior law lecturer at Melbourne’s RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub, told Cointelegraph. Lane said the U.S. “was justified” in bringing the charges against Zhao. While the charges were serious, they were “of a regulatory nature” and weren’t directly comparable to FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraud conviction, which landed him 25 years in prison, Lane added.However, many in and out of the crypto space have questioned why the two industry leaders have received such different treatment in the U.S. legal system. Meanwhile, Oregon has become the sixth state to revoke, suspend or decline to renew Binance.US’ license to operate there, following a spate of refusals in 2024. Nigerian court postpones trial of Binance execsLawyers representing Binance said they had not received the documents necessary to move forward with a money laundering case involving the firm, its head of financial crime compliance, Tigran Gambaryan and regional manager Nadeem Anjarwalla. The trial was expected to begin on May 2, but a judge reportedly adjourned proceedings until May 17 to allow the legal team to review the documents. The trial is separate from tax evasion charges brought against Binance, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla by Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. All parties have pleaded not guilty in the money laundering case.Continue reading BTC-e founder pleads guilty to laundering $9 billionAlexander Vinnik, the co-founder of the crypto exchange BTC-e, has pleaded guilty to money laundering conspiracy. This follows a broader investigation revealing extensive illegal activities on the exchange from 2011 to 2017. The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) stated that during Vinnik’s leadership, BTC-e processed more than $9 billion in transactions and had a user base exceeding one million globally, with many users in the United States.The DOJ highlighted that the platform was utilized to launder funds acquired from various criminal activities, including computer hacking, ransomware attacks and drug trafficking.Continue readingU.S. Justice Dept charges Roger Ver with tax fraudThe DOJ announced charges against early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, known by many as “Bitcoin Jesus.” Spanish authorities arrested Ver based on criminal charges in the U.S., including mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. The U.S. government alleged Ver defrauded the Internal Revenue Service out of roughly $48 million by failing to report capital gains on his sale of Bitcoin and other assets.According to the indictment, Ver allegedly took control of roughly 70,000 Bitcoin (BTC) in June 2017 — before the famous bull run — and sold many for $240 million. U.S. officials said they planned to extradite Ver from Spain to the United States to stand trial.Continue reading

Dutch Authorities Arrest Suspect in $33 Million ZKasino Crypto Fraud Case, Seize Millions in Assets



                    

Dutch authorities have apprehended a 26-year-old man in connection with fraudulent activities related to the ZKasino online gambling platform. 



The arrest, carried out by the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) on April 29, marks the first significant legal action in this case. 




The suspect is currently being investigated for fraud, embezzlement, and money laundering.



FIOD’s investigation led to the seizure of assets worth over 11.4 million euros, including cryptocurrencies, real estate, and luxury vehicles. 



These confiscations stem from allegations that ZKasino, which initially appeared as a promising blockchain-based gambling venture, was designed to defraud investors. 




Launched on April 20, the platform quickly attracted significant attention, amassing more than 10,515 Ether from over 10,000 contributors. 



It promised that these investments would be returned within 30 days.



However, the situation escalated when ZKasino transferred all collected Ether to the Lido staking protocol on the same day of its launch. 



READ MORE: Bitcoin Price Plunges Following Lackluster Debut of Hong Kong ETF




Further doubts were raised when the platform altered its website, removing previous assurances that the invested Ether would be returned to the investors.



The case grew more intriguing following a March post on social media platform X, where ZKasino boasted about securing a Series A funding round valued at $350 million. 



The purported round included investments from notable entities like crypto exchange MEXC and venture capital firm Big Brain Holdings. 



However, Big Brain Holdings later refuted these claims, stating, “which appears to be fraudulent,” indicating that it had never actually invested in ZKasino, although it had been offered tokens on a pro-rata basis.



The controversy surrounding ZKasino underscores the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments, particularly in platforms promising high returns with minimal transparency. 



As the investigation continues, with the suspect’s detention extended by 14 days for further inquiry, the crypto community remains vigilant, with many on X speculating about the suspect’s true identity. 



This case serves as a critical reminder of the importance of due diligence in the volatile realm of crypto investments.

XRP Price Explosion to $5 In The Cards as Ripple's Stablecoin Proves To Be Game-Changer ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
The XRP community is excitedly buzzing following Ripple’s tantalizing hints about its upcoming stablecoin project. At the XRP Las Vegas conference, Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, took the stage to discuss various aspects of the XRP Ledger, including the eagerly awaited stablecoin.



The audience, comprised of XRP enthusiasts and industry insiders, listened intently as Schwartz unveiled key details and hinted at what was to come.











Schwartz shared tantalizing details about Ripple’s stablecoin project during his presentation, leaving the audience eagerly anticipating more information.



He hinted that further details would be revealed at the upcoming XRPL Apex event in Amsterdam, scheduled for June 11-13. This teaser has sparked speculation and excitement within the XRP community, as they eagerly await more concrete details about Ripple’s stablecoin.



Ripple Stablecoin Ideal for Institutional Use



One key takeaway from Schwartz’s presentation is that Ripple’s stablecoin is designed with institutions in mind. The stablecoin is expected to cater to institutions interested in leveraging the benefits of the XRP Ledger but may be hesitant to venture into the world of digital assets.

&nbsp



By offering a stablecoin that is backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. government treasuries, and other cash equivalents, Ripple aims to provide a trusted and stable entry point for institutional investors.



Ripple’s stablecoin is not just about catering to institutional investors; it also has the potential to enhance the XRP Ledger ecosystem significantly.



By leveraging the XRP Ledger’s native features, such as its decentralized exchange and automated market maker, Ripple hopes to stimulate growth and adoption within the ecosystem.



This could open up new possibilities for institutional and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, further solidifying the XRP Ledger’s position in crypto.



Game-Changer for XRP Ledger



Overall, Ripple’s stablecoin project has the potential to be a game-changer for the XRP Ledger ecosystem. With its focus on institutional adoption and innovative approach to stablecoin design, Ripple is poised to impact the crypto market significantly.



Ripple’s announcement of a new stablecoin backed by the U.S. dollar in early April has stirred interest within the XRP community. The stablecoin will maintain a 1-to-1 peg with the U.S. dollar, with each token backed by assets, including U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. government bonds, and cash equivalents.



As per the announcement on April 4, Ripple plans to provide transparent monthly attestation reports for its reserves. Initially launching in the U.S., Ripple hasn’t ruled out expanding to Europe and Asia. This move puts Ripple in competition with stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle. PayPal also entered the $150 billion stablecoin market with its PayPal USD, backed by U.S. dollars and issued by Paxos.



As the XRPL event approaches, all eyes will be on Ripple as they reveal more details about this highly anticipated stablecoin project with analysts envisioning XRP breaking past the $5 price milestone.

Sui’s fails to perform well in the DeFi space.

One of the most unexpected performances made by a crypto protocol was the recent activity seen on the Sui network [SUI].
The daily transactions occurring on the SUI network and the number of daily active addresses on the network grew materially over the last few days.
Sui remains resilient
However, this activity was caused by Spam Sui. The Sui network has a dApp named Spam Sui, introducing an innovative “Spam to Earn” concept.
Unlike conventional crypto mining methods, users accrue “SPAM” coins by merely executing transactions on the Sui network. The greater the volume of transactions, the higher the amount of SPAM received.
With an impressive daily output of one billion SPAM coins, the primary aim is to drive a substantial number of transactions.
Even though the activity on the network was generated by Spam Sui, many people took to Twitter to express how impressive it was for SUI to handle so many transactions.
Over the last few days, the SUI network achieved a throughput of more than 800 TPS.

The high transaction volume handled by Sui demonstrates its scalability and potential to handle real-world use cases.
This can be very attractive to developers and users considering building or using applications on the Sui network.
However, the fact that the high transaction volume wasn’t due to genuine user activity can be seen as misleading. This might raise concerns about the network’s actual organic usage and could dampen sentiment.
Despite the surge in activity, Sui network failed to see growth in the DeFi department. The DEX (Decentralized Exchange) volumes on the network fell materially.
Over the last few weeks, the DEX volumes fell from 170 million to 90 million.

State of DeFi
Coupled with that, the TVL (Total Value Locked) on the Sui network had also fallen significantly. However, the revenue generated by the SUI network remained relatively the same.
This indicated that despite the declining interest in Sui network’s DeFi sector, the ability for the network to generate revenue remained unaffected.

Realistic or not, here’s SUI market cap in BTC’s terms

However, if the DeFi sector continues to underperform, Sui’s revenue generation might get affected.

At press time, SUI was trading at $1.13 and its price had grown by 5.03% in the last 24 hours.

Visa Claims Most Crypto Stablecoin Data Is ‘Noise’-Here's What Their Data Shows


								So far, the role of stablecoins in global transactions has become a focal point of discussions just as the crypto markets continue to go mainstream. However, with mounting concerns over the reliability of available data, Visa, a long-standing leader in financial services, has stepped forward to clarify the landscape.
Under the guidance of Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s Head of Crypto, the company recently launched an Onchain Analytics Dashboard aimed at cutting through the “noise” and providing a more accurate reflection of stablecoin activities, as highlighted by the report.

Decoding The Noise In Crypto Stablecoin Transactions
The introduction of this dashboard is Visa’s response to the prevalent issue of “misleading data” surrounding stablecoin usage. Despite their growing popularity, distinguishing genuine user transactions from automated bot activities remains challenging.
According to Sheffield’s recent insights on X, the new tool is designed to provide a “clear and accessible” view of the blockchain, focusing initially on stablecoins.
By filtering out noise such as bot transactions, which often inflate volume figures, the dashboard offers a “genuine” snapshot of stablecoin traction.
Visa’s analysis, driven by its innovative dashboard, has uncovered three critical trends that could reshape understanding of stablecoins’ market role.
Firstly, the total supply of stablecoins is nearing record highs, approaching $150 billion. This uptick indicates revived interest and trust in stablecoins despite the fluctuating dynamics of the broader cryptocurrency landscape.

Secondly, there has been a noticeable increase in active stablecoin users. The dashboard records approximately 27.5 million active users across various chains, highlighting the expanding reach of these digital assets.
A significant revelation from Visa’s tool is the stark contrast between reported stablecoin transfer volumes and those adjusted for non-human interactions.
While the unadjusted transfer volume for the past month stood at roughly $2.65 trillion, Visa’s refined metrics brought this number down to $265 billion, shedding light on the actual scale of organic financial activity.
The Real Story Behind Stablecoin Transactions
Furthermore, recent reports from Bloomberg, elaborating data from Visa, suggest that over 90% of stablecoin transaction volumes may not involve genuine users, hinting that adopting these crypto tokens as mainstream payment solutions might be distant.
Citing data from the dashboard Visa just developed in collaboration with Allium Labs, aimed at filtering out bot and large-scale trader activities to highlight transactions by actual users – In April, of the roughly $2.2 trillion processed, only $149 billion represented genuine, or “organic,” payment activities.

Pranav Sood, executive general manager for EMEA at Airwallex, commented on the data, noting that while stablecoins exhibit potential for long-term relevance, their immediate utility as payment instruments is still developing. Sood noted:
That’s not to say that they don’t have long-term potential, because I think they do. But the short-term and the mid-term focus needs to be on making sure that existing rails work much better.

Crypto firms to see more enforcement actions within 2 years - CFTC chair

Rostin Behnam, chair of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), expects regulators in the country to continue to crack down on cryptocurrency firms as long as the market attracts interest from investors.Speaking at the 2024 Global Conference on May 6, Behnam said despite “bad events” in 2022, which caused a market downturn and several companies to declare bankruptcy, the crypto market continues to grow and attract investors and entrepreneurs. He did not specifically say whether the CFTC or Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would be behind enforcement actions to protect investors, but both regulators have ongoing lawsuits against many crypto firms.“We’re going to probably see in the next 6 to 18 months, or 6 to 24 months, another cycle of enforcement actions because of this cycle of asset appreciation and interest by retail investors,” said the CFTC chair. “Without a regulatory framework, without that transparency, without those tools that we typically use, as regulators, you’re going to continue to see this fraud and manipulation.” Source: Eleanor TerrettBehnam agreed with a moderator that having U.S. lawmakers bring crypto firms into the regulatory framework was the proper course of action. Members of the House of Representatives are awaiting a floor vote on legislation that could clarify the roles of the SEC and CFTC over digital assets, which moved out of committee in July 2023.Related: CFTC commissioner warns against infringing on SEC’s authority in KuCoin caseAccording to a Cornerstone Research report released in January, the number of crypto-related enforcement cases brought by the SEC in 2023 was the highest since 2013. The regulator has cases pending against U.S. crypto firms, including Kraken, Binance and Coinbase, and issued a Wells notice — usually a precursor to an enforcement action — to Robinhood Crypto on May 4.Behnam said in October that roughly a third of all enforcement actions the CFTC had taken against crypto firms occurred in 2023. The CFTC reported in November it had initiated 47 actions in the digital asset commodities sector, with cases including those against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky. The Commission was also a party to the $4.3 billion settlement between Binance and U.S. authorities in November.Magazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime

Why This Cycle Is Cooked | Bankless


The EIGEN airdrop has triggered discussion about the rift between private and public markets. The points-based, large private rounds-fueled, high-FDV airdrop meta is creating structural problems with the vibes of the crypto industry.  Points programs that turn into multi-billion dollar, low-float tokens is not a stable equilibrium, yet we nonetheless find ourselves cornered in this meta by a confluence of factors: an overabundance of VC capital, a lack of new entrants, and an overbearing regulator. The meta around token issuances is always in flux, here are the major eras we've seen: 2013: PoW fork-and-fair launch meta2017: ICO meta2020: liquidity mining era (DeFi Summer) 2021: NFT mints2024: the points & airdrop metaEach new token distribution mechanism brought its merits, and each one had its drawbacks. Sadly, this particular meta begins from a place of structural retail disadvantage, a natural consequence of the unforgiving regulatory spotlight that’s hovering over the industry. 
Abundant VC Dollars vs. RetailRight now, there is simply an oversupply of venture capital in the crypto industry. Despite the terrible year 2023 was for VC fundraising, there is still plenty of capital from 2021 raises, and in general raising from VCs in crypto is a persistent, ongoing activity. Currently, an abundance of well-capitalized VC firms are still willing to continue leading rounds at valuations in the billions of dollars, meaning crypto startups have room to stay private longer and longer. This is rational of course, because if tokens are currently launching at multiples of their last raise, then even the late VCs can still find a good deal. The problem is, by the time a startup releases a public token at $1-10 billion, much of the upside has already been discovered by earlier parties – i.e., No one is going to get rich by buying a $10B token. By structurally disadvantaging public market capital, the vibes of the crypto industry are souring. People want to get rich with their internet friends and form strong online communities and friendships around this activity. This is the promise of crypto, and this promise is currently not being fulfilled. 
Billions of unlocks, no new entrants Here are a few datapoints that together should give you some pause:Vance’s napkin math says $200-300 Billion in sell pressure from VC unlocks in 2024+2025
Coinbase’s Q2 report illustrates further evidence that new market entrants are not present, at least not in size
Since there aren’t a meaningful number of new entrants this cycle, VC capital significantly outweighs the demand for the fruits of that capital
Since retail predominantly owns the long-tail of crypto assets, the institutional liquidity coming in through the Bitcoin ETFs is not going to bid these markets. Capital recycling from crypto-natives dumping their $14k BTC buys on Larry Fink can prop up these assets for a while, but it's all internal capital from PVP-capable players who know how unlocks work, and how to avoid them. The Effect of the SEC By restricting the ability for startups to more freely raise capital and distribute tokens, the SEC is encouraging capital to flow into private markets, which has fewer regulatory constraints. The SEC’s corrupt and overbearing nature towards the nature of tokens is nerfing the value of capital in the public markets, as startups cannot trade their tokens for public market capital without triggering mass aneurysms among their legal teams. Crypto’s March Towards Compliance Crypto has slowly become more compliant as it has progressed. When I got into crypto, during the 2017 ICO mania, ICOs were touted as a way to democratize investment and access to capital. ICOs of course devolved into an exploited grift, but nonetheless it was a story that compelled me and many others toward the potential that crypto can bring to the world. But the ICO meta ended when it became apparent that regulators were viewing these transactions as clear unregistered securities sales. The industry then pivoted into liquidity mining, which went through a similar process. Every cycle, crypto manages to obfuscate its method of distributing tokens to the public, and every cycle, it becomes a little harder to hide this process – a process that is crucial to the decentralization of the projects, and the nature of our industry.This cycle has the most unrelenting regulatory spotlight that we’ve ever seen, and thus the lawyers of VC-funded startups have been given the biggest compliance challenges the industry has ever experienced: distribute tokens to the public, without getting sued by regulators. Disrupting the Balance Regulatory compliance shifts the fulcrum of the public-private market to be heavily weighted towards the private side – since startups can choose to simply accept VC capital instead of potentially violating securities laws.The position of the fulcrum that balances private vs public capital is determined by the strength of the chokehold that regulators have over the crypto markets. If there were no investor accreditation laws, then this fulcrum would be more balanced. If there was a clear regulatory path for compliantly issuing tokens, then the differences between public and private markets would be smaller. If the SEC wasn’t engaged in a war on crypto, then we would have far more fair and orderly markets. Since the SEC won’t provide clear rules of the road, we end up with a complicated and convoluted ‘points’ meta which satisfies no one. Points are unfair, disorderly markets ‘Points’ give retail users zero clarity on what they are actually receiving, because if there was ever an explicit articulation of what points actually are (a claim on tokens), the team would expose themselves as potentially violating securities laws (from the perspective of an overbearing and corrupt SEC regulator). Points offer no investor protections, because in order to offer investor protections, the process needs to be given regulatory legitimacy in the first place. As a result of this extremely shitty conclusion that we’ve found ourselves in, we’ve discovered the Sybil vs Community debate, in which LayerZero is stuck between a rock-and-a-hard place. 
LayerZero recently announced a program for airdrop Sybils to self-report their Sybil attack on the incoming LayerZero airdrop, which triggered Kain Warwick to write this thread defending the Sybils as a group of people who have significantly supported LayerZero’s metrics, and have raised LayerZero’s perceived status in the market. In reality, there is no line between a community member and a Sybil. Since your average crypto participant has no way of engaging in the private markets, the only way they have to gain exposure is pushing through committed and meaningful activity on the platform they want the token for. In the absence of simply letting small-time investors write small-time checks into early rounds of crypto projects, the current token issuance meta has forced users to Sybil the projects they are bullish on. As a result, no ‘communities’ are banding together getting rich this cycle, like they did with LINK in 2020, or SOL in 2023. The current meta of token issuances don’t give affordances to communities gaining early exposure at low valuations. As a reaction, Twitter mob attacks on airdropping startups are increasingly common – a logical consequence of communities of not being able to express their desires as valid stakeholders in a project. Big "No taxation without representation!" vibes. This is to say nothing about the other snake in the grass: mercenary capital exploitatively farming tokens to dump. Without the ability for small-time investor to invest in earlier stages of a startup, these highly-aligned investors have to compete with toxic mercenary farmers for an airdrop, without any distinguishable difference between these two parties. An Inadequate Equilibrium The ‘points’ meta has become too explicit to be sustainable. Both the SEC and grifters are coming for it, and both will try to exploit it to their benefit. We will have to move on to a different strategy, hopefully one more thoughtful about making many early community stakeholders wealthy while also not triggering the ire of the SEC. Sadly, without a regulatory carveout for token issuances, this is a pipe dream.The meta is dead – long live the meta.

What Does Today's SEC Ruling on Robinhood Mean? Is This A Covert Attack On Altcoin? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Prominent figures in the cryptocurrency law community have accused the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of overstepping its bounds in its latest crackdown on crypto companies. The criticism comes after cryptocurrency and stock brokerage Robinhood announced that it had received a Wells Notice from the SEC regarding cryptocurrencies.
Variant Fund's Chief Legal Officer, Jake Chervinsky, expressed on social media his surprise at the number of Wells Notices the SEC has sent to crypto companies in recent months. “It is hard to imagine that they would (or could) make so many enforcement decisions at once,” he wrote, adding: “They appear to be abusing the Wells process now as a scare tactic.”


Chervinsky went on to accuse the SEC of disproportionately focusing its efforts on the crypto industry rather than the equity and debt markets.
He warned that if the SEC took as many enforcement actions as it did sending Wells Notices, it would be “in flagrant violation of both the law and the authority of Congress.” Otherwise, he argued, he was “blatantly abusing the Wells process to collect free information and terrorize honest U.S. companies.”





Rodrigo Silva-Herzog, special counsel at Cooley LLP and former special counsel at Paradigm, echoed Chervinsky's sentiments. He questioned whether SEC Chairman Gary Gensler had overstepped his bounds with his ongoing “anti-crypto bombardment campaign.”

The controversy comes as Robinhood announced Monday that it plans to file an enforcement action against the company's cryptocurrency for alleged securities violations, according to an SEC filing on Form 8-K.


“This is the latest in a series of new Wells Notices that appear to cover a broad swath of different types of actions, but all relate to the crypto space,” Gary DeWaal, senior attorney at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, said in an interview.

“I think this is a testament to the SEC's continued interest in the crypto space and their desire to exercise jurisdiction in areas where they frankly don't have full jurisdiction yet.
“There seems to be some assertion at the moment that Ethereum is a security that could underpin all of these actions.”

But DeWaal added that without seeing the Wells Notices, it's unclear what each one is about.

SEC Under Fire for Wells Notice ‘Abuse’ as It Hunts Robinhood - DailyCoin


        
The SEC is targeting Robinhood’s crypto division in new enforcement actions.



Industry legal experts have questioned the SEC’s broader actions as abusive.



The firm has expressed disappointment with the commission’s approach to regulations.
Over the past year, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been on a regulatory attack streak against crypto service providers, engaging in battles with major entities such as Binance, Coinbase, Ripple, and more. The latest target of the commission’s regulatory scrutiny is the retail crypto trading platform Robinhood, which was recently served a Wells notice as a prelude to a potential enforcement action.However, the commission’s enforcement actions have once again sparked criticism of its approach to industry regulations.SEC vs Robinhood: Crypto “Carpet Bombing Campaign”Commenting on the SEC’s notice against Robinhood’s crypto division, Cooley LLP legal counsel and former Paradigm executive Rodrigo Silva-Herzog asserted that the move is the latest in the commission’s streak of aggressive “carpet bombing” campaigns against the industry.
Silva-Herzog emphasized Rohbinhood’s CEO, Dan Gallagher’s former position as an ex-US President OBAMA-appointed SEC commissioner, emphasizing that the present SEC chair, Gary Gensler, may have taken on a significantly stronger legal battle than he can handle.Echoing the sentiment, Variant Fund Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky condemned the SEC for abusing the Wells notice as a scare tactic against crypto firms. He asserted that the number of notices sent about crypto in recent months is astonishing, raising questions about how the commission can launch so many enforcement actions at once.Chervinsky and Silva-Herzog’s assertions align with Robinhood’s response to the SEC’s actions.Robinhood CLO Condemns SECIn a blog post on Monday, May 6, CLO Dan Gallagher expressed disappointment with the regulatory commission for disappointed that the agency’s actions, 
“After years of good faith attempts to work with the SEC for regulatory clarity including our well-known attempt to ‘come in and register,’ we are disappointed that the agency has decided to issue a Wells Notice related to our U.S. crypto business.”Spotlighting its compliance actions, the firm reiterated past “difficult choices” not to list products flagged by the commission as securities in public actions against other platforms, including its efforts to register as a special purpose broker-dealer with the agency. Robinhood emphasized its belief that its offerings are not securities, expressing readiness to “demonstrate how weak any case” against the firm by the SEC would be on both the facts and the law.On the Flipside
In the wake of the news, Robinhood tanked a sharp 5% in the premarket.



On April 11, the SEC issued a similar notice to the decentralized exchange Uniswap.



The SEC is still locked in legal battles against exchanges and projects, including Coinbase and Ripple.
Why This MattersWhile the SEC’s notice against Robinhood’s crypto division hasn’t yet escalated into a legal battle, it mirrors the pattern of aggressive enforcement actions seen in previous cases, which has often resulted in prolonged legal battles and hefty sanctions.Read this article to understand how the past actions have brought backlash to Chair Gensler:“Fire Gary Gensler!” Lawmakers Endorse Act to Oust SEC Chair  The Sui Network has addressed recent FUD about its token supply; read more: Sui Network Dispels ‘Shady’ Token Supply Allegations

CFTC’s Behnam warns crypto industry that more enforcement actions are coming - Blockworks


A crypto bull market, coupled with the still-uncertain regulatory environment is going to create the perfect storm for increased enforcement actions, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Rostin Behnam said. 
“We find ourselves with a growing market, growing capital [and] investments, growing market capitalization, and I think a renewed interest by a lot of the entrepreneurs,” Behnam said Monday during a discussion at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference in Los Angeles. 
“From my standpoint, as a regulator, we’re going to probably see in the next six to 18 months or six to 24 months another cycle of enforcement actions.” 
Without action from Congress and increased regulatory transparency, Behnam added, agencies are going to lean more heavily on lawsuits.

“If you actually count the number of [Congressional] working days between now and the election…it’s really not that much time,” Behnam said when asked about the odds of any of the crypto-related bills making it to the floor for a vote in the House and Senate. 
“Getting legislation done these days is difficult,” he added, but noted that there is “momentum” and “desire” from lawmakers to close some of the regulatory gaps around crypto, particularly with regards to stablecoin legislation. 
Behnam’s comments come days after retail trading platform Robinhood announced it received a Wells notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Securities regulators plan to proceed with an enforcement action relating to cryptocurrencies traded on the exchange, Robinhood said in a filing Saturday. 
“After years of good faith attempts to work with the SEC for regulatory clarity including our well-known attempt to ‘come in and register,’ we are disappointed that the agency has decided to issue a Wells Notice related to our US crypto business,” Dan Gallagher, Robinhood’s chief legal and compliance officer, said in a statement. 
Last week, Consensys revealed it was also served a Wells notice from the SEC, in addition to a number of subpoenas relating to Ethereum. The SEC has not yet brought an enforcement action against Consensys, but the crypto firm is suing the exchange preemptively. 
Behnam did not comment Monday on his agency’s relationship with the SEC with regards to crypto industry regulation, but Congressional leaders have been debating about how to address the so-called “turf war” between the agencies for over a year.
“When we have two agencies contradicting each other about whether one of the most utilized stablecoins in the market is a security or a commodity, we end up with uncertainty,” Rep. French Hill, R-Ark., who chairs the House Subcommittee on Digital Assets, said during an April 2023 hearing.

Expecting the Rise in Bitcoin to Continue, Provincial Capo Announced the Two Altcoins in which it Opened a Long Position! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Bitcoin started the day on a rise and broke above $65,000. While this rise in BTC also mobilized altcoins, the news from the SEC caused BTC to fall below $ 64,000.
While Bitcoin was experiencing both rise and fall during the day, Capo of Crypto, who is known for his bearish views and is frequently criticized by investors for his bearish comments, said that he expects the rise to continue.


Stating that the short-term correction is over, il Capo stated that he expects the rise to continue.
At this point, the analyst stated that he opened a long position in some altcoins at the bottom levels and explained that these altcoins include ZCX and Solana (SOL).





The analyst added that he shared the altcoins in which he opened long positions but with a market value of less than 100 million dollars only with his friends and not with his followers.
Also sharing an image of the SOL long position, il Capo said that he was in profit in the SOL position.



“The short-term correction seems to be over. We expect the rise to continue soon.
When I said a local bottom was likely soon, many people asked about the altcoins I was buying.
I shared some of them where I opened long positions, such as ZCX and SOL. However, I shared others with market caps below $100 million with my friends because I do not want to affect their prices, even if it is in a positive way.”

Only 10% Of Stablecoin Transaction Volumes In April Originated From 'Organic Payments Activity' - PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), Visa (NYSE:V) - Benzinga

A study conducted by Visa V and Allium Labs unveiled that more than 90% of stablecoin transactions are not genuine, raising questions on the digital tokens' belief.What Happened: According to the dashboard created by Visa and Allium Labs, stablecoins are far from achieving universal acceptance as a payment method. The study’s metric, which filters out transactions initiated by bots and large-scale traders, showed that of the $2.2 trillion total transactions in April, only $149 billion were "organic payments activity", as reported by The Business Times.These findings are contradictory to the claims of stablecoin advocates, including fintech heavyweights like PayPal PYPL and Stripe, who are making substantial progress in the stablecoin arena.Pranav Sood, executive general manager for the EMEA region at payments platform Airwallex, stated that stablecoins are at a very early stage as a payment instrument.  "That's not to say that they don't have long-term potential, because I think they do. But the short-term and the mid-term focus needs to be on making sure that existing rails work much better," Sood said.Also Read: Tether Looks Beyond Stablecoins, Restructures Operations Into Four DivisionsWhy It Matters: Data provider Glassnode estimated that the record $3 trillion of total market circulation attributed to digital tokens at the peak of the 2021 bull market was actually around $875 billion.Visa, which processed over $12 trillion worth of transactions last year, could potentially lose out if stablecoins become a universally accepted payment method. However, analysts at Bernstein predict that the total value of all stablecoins in circulation could reach $2.8 trillion by 2028.This comes at a time when the U.S. is making strides towards stablecoin regulation. Although efforts to pass the U.S. stablecoin legislation were stalled, progress is expected soon. This development could have significant implications for the future of stablecoins and their potential as a mainstream payment method.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: US Stablecoin Regulation Talks Stall, But Progress Is NearThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

Grayscale Finally Turns it Around | Bankless


GBTC Goes Big. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced its first net inflow since converting to a spot ETF! Did we just enter a more bullish paradigm, or is there an alternative explanation for this unexpected inflow?Bitcoin was much less institutionalized during the last bull run, but investors could still leverage GBTC to gain BTC exposure through a traditional brokerage account.At this time, net new buys were restricted to accredited investors and subject to a lock up period – initially 12 months and later reduced to 6 months – before they could sell those shares on the market, causing shares to trade at a massive premium to net asset value (NAV) as retail investors feverishly sought to ape BTC through a convenient and regulated avenue.Unfortunately for holders, this premium turned to a discount as demand for BTC waned toward the end of February 2021, with the instrument's lack of redeemability preventing its market price from converging to NAV.Friday’s inflow snapped the nearly 80 day outflow streak that GBTC had experienced since redeemability was enabled upon conversion to a spot ETF and was the first time Grayscale purchased BTC for this product since the premium closed over three years ago!
GBTC's strong performance coincided with simultaneous inflows across all spot BTC ETFs, starkly contrasting against the record-setting outflow day on Wednesday when all products experienced simultaneous outflows.It is evident that BTC price movements are the primary drivers of spot ETF flows, with Wednesday’s outflows coinciding with BTC's fall below $60k and Friday's inflows aligned with a sudden surge in its price, and it appears likely they will remain the predominant factor behind ETF flows moving forward.While bulls are hopeful that GBTC’s ability to buck the outflow streak may signal the instrument has found a natural equilibrium, the presence of a single inflow day alone is insufficient to confirm this speculation: there is little significance behind this one-time event without a continuation in GBTC inflows.Given GBTC's hefty 1.5% management fee, which is six times higher than that of most issuers, it is often considered one of the best methods for shorting BTC.Although it's conceivable that shares were created with the intention of lending them to short sellers, the high availability of GBTC shares for borrowing supports the notion that this may have actually been a bullish inflow.

Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE) to Skyrocket 7,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Bonk and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 7,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because FLYPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Flying Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in BONK and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Flying Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Flying Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Flying Pepe by entering its contract address – 65orYrJbQxa5BZUWyeCsDtJC7JZg8zQYcvRZpvnnd5eq – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Bonk (BONK), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many BONK, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like FLYPEPE.

Two Big Bitcoin Catalysts Could Drive MicroStrategy Stock Gains, TD Cowen Says

Vitanza, who attended MicroStrategy’s World 2024 user forum in Las Vegas last week, however, said customers had significant positive feedback regarding the firm’s legacy software business, founded long before Saylor pushed the company to purchase billions of dollars of bitcoin. “This is causing us to rethink the potential upside around the operating business,” he wrote.

VeChain teams up with UFC to tokenize fighter gloves - Crypto Briefing




A partnership between VeChain Foundation and the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) to tokenize fighters’ gloves was announced on April 12 during the global press conference for UFC 300. The effort consists of tracking fighting data using a near-field communication (NFC) chip installed within the gloves and registering feedback using the VeChainThor network.The VeChain Foundation has had a $100 million sponsorship deal with the UFC since 2022. Fabio Konder, Activation Director at VeChain Foundation, shared with Crypto Briefing during UFC 301, which took place in Rio de Janeiro last Saturday, how blockchain made its way to the fighting sports realm.“When we closed the sponsorship deal with UFC, it was obvious to me that this would be a natural development,” said Konder. “A sponsorship deal is about visibility, but Sunny’s [Lu, VeChain founder] intention was to go further and offer a platform for the community: to create connections, to incentivize projects, and strengthen them. It became clear that the next step would be technological.”Therefore, by looking at previous collaborations with Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, and Walmart, which consisted of making the supply chain more robust by applying blockchain technology, VeChain Foundation’s Activation Director understood that this could be an avenue to work with UFC.“Tracking data with blockchain is our bread and butter. I worked with UFC for seven years and knew they had issues with their gloves and an innovation process was taking place. So I suggested the tracking chip combined with a blockchain register.”The issues mentioned by Konder are related to fighters breaking their hands during the fight and the easiness of spreading fingers while wearing it, which makes accidental eye-poking more susceptible. This new glove will start being used at UFC 302.The data registered on VeChainThor then has two purposes: first, a reliable way to store the feedback from the new gloves; second, it will prevent counterfeit gloves from being sold on the secondary market, as the chip is registered as a non-fungible token (NFT) that can be easily verified with a smartphone.Hence, gloves used in UFC fights are now a tokenized real-world asset (RWA), making them ‘phygital’ items with physical and digital versions.“In this new initiative, the fighters will donate their gloves after the fight, and the blockchain register makes it a more powerful memorabilia since it will also have the fighting data from the athlete. Let’s say Aldo retires after his fight today. The owner of the glove will be able to check how Aldo fought, and the amount of blows he applied.”Moreover, Konder revealed that another initiative between VeChain and UFC aimed at preventing counterfeiting and tracking stolen items is being developed in the background, although he explained that this is not set to go public yet.

Elon Musk’s Tesla Adds Dogecoin Payments On Its Website, Is X Next? | Bitcoinist.com


								Tesla, an American multinational automotive and clean energy company led by billionaire entrepreneur, Elon Musk, has announced that it will now accept Dogecoin (DOGE) as a form of payment on certain products in the Tesla shop. 
This move comes as an exciting development for Tesla and the broader crypto community as it marks another pivotal instance where major corporations embrace meme-based cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it also raises speculations about whether Musk’s other ventures, particularly X Payments, could follow suit and adopt Dogecoin. 
Tesla Integrates Dogecoin As A Payment Method
Tesla has integrated Dogecoin into its payments system, allowing users to purchase merchandise when they opt for Dogecoin-eligible products. The automotive company made the announcement on its official platform, providing a comprehensive overview of utilizing Dogecoin for payments, including details on associated fees and requirements.

Tesla disclosed that customers can use Dogecoin to purchase merchandise through the Tesla shop. Additionally, select products will have prices listed in DOGE, making it easier for customers to identify products eligible for DOGE payments. 
The automotive firm has also indicated that Dogecoin payments may take between one minute to six hours to process and confirm during transactions. Moreover, the company has emphasized that it only recognizes and accepts Dogecoin in its digital currency payments, disregarding other cryptocurrencies. 
Following Tesla’s announcement, the price of DOGE has been moving upward by 0.78%, trading at $0.16, as of writing. It also experienced a 15.48% increase over the past few days, according to CoinMarketCap. 
A member of the crypto community, identified as “Kyledoops,” on X (formerly Twitter), disclosed that Dogecoin’s price has surged by more than 40% over the past four days, suggesting that the upward momentum may have been an anticipatory move to Tesla’s impending announcement. 
As the crypto community closely monitors  DOGE’S performance post-Tesla’s announcement, speculations are building concerning X Payments being the next in line for DOGE adoption. 
Is X Payments The Next Stop For DOGE Adoption?
The possibility of Dogecoin being integrated into Musk’s recently launched X Payment platform has been an ongoing debate within the crypto community even before the platform’s release. With Musk endorsing the popular meme-based cryptocurrency by accepting it as a payment method on Tesla, expectations of X Payments being the next stop for DOGE adoption are high. 

The integration of Dogecoin into X Payments could open up new avenues for its everyday use, fostering the adoption of the cryptocurrency and providing community members more flexibility and accessibility when they navigate the social media platform, X. Despite expectations being high, neither Musk nor the X team has disclosed information regarding the potential incorporation of DOGE payments into X’s platform.

NEAR Price Rally: 9% Surge Recaptures Key Level, Records 160% TVL Growth In Q1


                            Decentralized application (dApp) platform Near Protocol exhibited notable growth in key metrics during the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, driving its native token NEAR to reclaim a crucial key level and paving the way for a potential retest of its all-time high (ATH) from January 2022. 
According to a recent report by Messari, NEAR experienced significant increases in market capitalization, revenue, active addresses, and Total Value Locked (TVL), solidifying its position among the top players in the cryptocurrency market.
NEAR Outperforms Bitcoin And Ethereum
In Q1 2024, NEAR’s circulating market cap surged to $7.2 billion, marking a 94% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) increase. The fully diluted market cap also witnessed substantial growth, reaching $8.2 billion, representing a 91% QoQ increase. These numbers propelled NEAR to secure a spot among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

Notably, NEAR outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which recorded QoQ growth rates of 69% and 53%, respectively. Additionally, NEAR’s revenue, derived from network transaction fees, witnessed an 82% QoQ increase, reaching $1.9 million. 
NEAR continued its address growth trend in Q1 2024, with average daily active addresses reaching 1.2 million, representing a robust 42% QoQ increase. 
The network also witnessed a surge in daily new addresses, totaling 236,000 (a 37% QoQ increase), and surpassed the milestone of 100 million total accounts. 
According to Messari, contributions from established protocols like KAIKAINOW, Sweat, and Playember and the adoption of HOT Wallet, averaging over 350,000 daily active addresses in March and nearly 3 million total wallets, drove this expansion.
Stablecoin Market Cap Soars In Q1
Per the report, the protocol experienced a sustained increase in transaction activity throughout Q1 2024, with daily transactions reaching 4.3 million, representing a 78% QoQ increase and a 538% increase over the last six months. 
Similarly, NEAR’s TVL witnessed substantial growth, ending the quarter at $335 million, a 163% increase from the previous quarter and a 547% increase over the last six months.

Furthermore, NEAR’s decentralized exchange (DEX) volume experienced a notable surge, with an average daily volume of $8 million, representing a 95% QoQ increase. Ref Finance emerged as the leading DEX on the protocol, with $6 million daily volume, surpassing Orderly Network.
Lastly, NEAR observed a significant increase in its stablecoin market cap during Q1 2024, soaring 176% QoQ to $214 million. Notably, USDT experienced a significant surge, with its market cap increasing by 1,155% QoQ, reaching $88 million. 
Outperforming Top 20 Cryptocurrencies
Regarding price action, NEAR Protocol’s native token has exhibited strong performance, surpassing the top 20 cryptocurrencies in the market with a 9.4% uptrend in the past seven days. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has experienced a minor 1.5% price correction over the past 24 hours.
This positive trend has enabled NEAR to reclaim the significant $7.40 price level, which is important for bullish investors. 
Looking ahead, the $7.60 mark may present a potential resistance level for the token, serving as a crucial barrier to monitoring. It could pave the way for a retest of the $8 mark, signaling further upward momentum if successfully breached.

Conversely, the $6.80 mark has demonstrated its significance as a key support level. It was previously tested over the weekend and effectively prevented a more significant price decline. 
Despite the optimistic outlook, it is important to note that the token remains down by over 64% from its all-time high of $20.4, reached in 2022.

Memecoins sell-off as Bitcoin price takes the spotlight - Is meme season over?

Memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) are among the cryptocurrencies underperforming the market on May 6, highlighting a diversion from the momentum that drove the sector higher last week. Data from CoinGecko shows that the total market capitalization of memecoins has dropped in the last 24 hours, falling 2.7% to $55.48 billion.Bonk (BONK) declined the most, losing 6% of its market value over the last 24 hours. Floki (FLOKI) followed with a 3.3% loss, and Memecoin (MEME) came in third after declining 3% over the same period.Performance of top-cap memecoins. Source: CoinGeckoDOGE – the leading meme token by market capitalization – saw a 2.1% price decline on the day, bringing its market cap to $22.74 billion. Notably, DOGE still accounts for nearly 41% of the memecoin sectors’ ’ total market share.Its rival, SHIB, was also correcting on May 6, down 2.4% on the day, decreasing its market cap to $14.29 billion, cementing its position as the second most popular memecoin.Let’s look at some of the reasons why memecoins are down today.Weak altcoin market structureFrom a historical perspective, the bull market is usually driven by a rally in altcoins. However, in line with the current correction of memecoin prices, TOTAL3 - the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH)- has experienced a pullback after its rally that began in October 2023.The chart below shows that TOTAL3 has decreased by 15% since the first week of April to $661.41 billion. This pull-back has led to the appearance of a descending parallel channel on the weekly chart, as shown below.Traders booked profits as the relative strength index (RSI) on the weekly chart became overbought after crossing 70 at the height of the Solana-based memecoin frenzy.An RSI reading above 70 means the altcoins were becoming overvalued, so they embarked on a trend reversal or corrective pullback.Total crypto market cap excluding BTC and ETH. Source: TradingViewAltcoins are still pursuing an extended downtrend, confirmed by TOTAL3's downward movement inside a descending parallel channel. The RSI’s value has moved from 89 to 62 over the last seven weeks, suggesting that the market conditions still favor the downside. If TOTAL3 fails to rise above the upper boundary of the declining channel at $660 billion, altcoins, including major memecoins, could continue correcting over the next few weeks.Memecoin trading volumes continue to dropMemecoin weekly trading volume has been reducing since early March, as reported by Cointelegraph. Data from Dune reveals that memecoin transaction flows across all blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana, have dropped collectively by 81% from its recent top of roughly $998.55 million in March to $191.88 million the week ending May 3. This suggests that traders' interest or confidence in the sector has waned lately.Memecoins total trading volumes. Source: DuneLooking at individual memecoins, historical data from CoinMarketCap shows that DOGE’s trading volume dropped by approximately 50% between March 7 and May 6. Similarly, SHIB’s and PEPE’s trading volumes have plummeted by 88% and 51% over the same period.Related: BONK, POPCAT and Solana memecoins stay green even as Bitcoin price dropsTraders de-risk after strong U.S. macroeconomic dataThe decreasing possibility of interest cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2024 according to the May 1 FOMC statement have also boosted risk-off sentiment in the crypto market, particularly affecting memecoins, which are among the most profitable assets so far in 2024.​​Top crypto narrative profits in Q1: Memecoins +1,313%, RWA +286%As the U.S. economy appears to strengthen, traders are more attracted to safe yield assets, such as the U.S. Treasurys, compared to non-yielding assets, such as digital currencies.Consequently, this shift diminishes the appeal of riskier investments, including memecoins. As such, investors may be taking profits they made on memecoins during the first quarter of 2024 to invest in other sectors of the crypto ecosystem.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Analytics Platform Santiment Shares Two Altcoins Trending Today: One is Trending Because of Warren Buffett - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to data shared by the cryptocurrency analysis platform Santiment, two altcoins have become an extra trend among users today.
According to analysts, the first of these altcoins stands out as Worldcoin (WLD). WLD, which is actually an AI-themed token, experienced a 44% increase in market value in May. WLD hit a bottom in April.


Interestingly, billionaire Warren Buffett played a big role in WLD's recent rise to the agenda and its positive impact. According to analysts, the token rose after Buffett recently made a controversial statement that potentially illegal financial activities are becoming more common with artificial intelligence.

Worldcoin is known as a cryptocurrency project of Sam Altman, CEO of the recently popular artificial intelligence company OpenAI. Especially in low-income countries, people obtain WLD tokens for free by recording their eye irises on devices called orbs. This brings up discussions about privacy.





The second trending altcoin on Santiment's list was Litecoin (LTC). LTC has seen renewed interest recently due to the connection to Grayscale and views on Litecoin ETFs potentially emerging in the future, according to analysts.

Grayscale's Ethereum Fund Discount Steadies as ETF Deadline Looms - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsAs a key May deadline for spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the U.S. draws closer, shares of Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) appear to have found firmer footing.As of Friday, shares in Grayscale’s ETHE traded at a 22% discount relative to the funds’ crypto holdings, according to data from YCharts. Since March 22, that discount has ranged between 21% and 26%, widening from as little as 8% earlier that month.Many crypto market analysts have expressed doubt that spot Ethereum ETFs will be approved in the U.S. in the short term. We will know soon enough, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be required to respond to its earliest applications for such a product from asset manager VanEck by May 25.Mark Connors, head of research at digital asset investment firm 3iQ, told Decrypt that ETHE’s steadying discount reflects “not only pricing in the downside of regulation, but [also] the upside of industry action.”Meanwhile, approval odds for spot Ethereum ETFs in May have declined from 76% in January to 6% on Monday, according to traders on the prediction platform Polymarket. Those chances haven’t been helped by revelations in April that the SEC internally views Ethereum as a security.Approval odds for spot Bitcoin ETFs were initially boosted last year by Grayscale’s courtroom victory over the SEC. The judge found the agency’s previous Grayscale denials to be arbitrary and capricious. That decision paved the way for a slate of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in January—including the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).By shorting Bitcoin while holding GBTC, investors were able to capitalize on GBTC’s waning discount, Conors explained. As to why ETHE’s discount has remained little changed over the past several weeks, Connors said some could be posturing for a repeat—even if that means holding ETHE through any litigation that might follow the expected denials from the SEC.“People have been rewarded for that,” Connors said, referencing institutions that traded GBTC through its eventual conversion to an ETF. “There's a load of hedge funds that know this trade.”As once was the case with GBTC, ETHE trades at a discount or premium relative to its crypto holdings because of the fund’s structure. Without a mechanism in place for the creation or redemption of shares, ETHE’s discount swelled to as much as 60% in early 2023.Each share of ETHE corresponds to approximately 0.0094 Ethereum—worth around $29. Because of the fund’s structure, however, ETHE shares currently trade hands at $22.50.Alongside VanEck’s bid to establish a new spot Ethereum ETF, Grayscale wants to convert its fund into one as well. They are among several firms waiting on the SEC for a response, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Hashdex, Invesco and Galaxy, and Ark Invest and 21Shares.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin’s Decline Fails To Ruffle Traders Even As Prices Reach Two-Month Lows ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
As Bitcoin’s (BTC) price slid below the $60K mark, a cross-section of investors expressed a keen belief in the end of the bull market, but others stoically accepted the correction as a small blip in the grand scheme of things.



The largest cryptocurrency hit its lowest ebb since February after trading at $59,000 at the start of May, dragging the rest of the ecosystem underwater. As prices fell, several traders resigned themselves to the fate that the asset could slip to the $50K mark, sparking a dry spell for the asset.



The pessimists point to a tepid price performance in April, which saw the asset lose 16% over the course of the month. Presently, BTC trades at 20% less than its famous all-time high of $73,000, which it attained in the middle of March.A cynical economic forecast by the US Federal Reserve may have contributed to the price decline, with authorities bracing for slower growth, which experts are terming stagflation.



“We continue to see evidence of the Fed needing to be leaning back to a higher for longer policy outlook, despite investor calls for more accommodation,” said Joel Kruger, an executive at LMAX Group.



Despite the falling prices, several investors are eyeing new entry points to re-enter the market, with some predicting prices to fall to $50,000.

&nbsp



The analysts are also hinging their hypothesis on BTC’s cyclical nature of garnering lower interest in the summer months. Over a five-year window, buying Bitcoin in May and selling in September will leave traders with cumulative losses of -29%, compared to opening and closing trades in other months.



According to Rekt Capital, BTC is repeating 2016’s cyclical trend that saw the asset dip by nearly 20% after the halving event, hinting that the asset could sink even lower.



“I’m expecting a sell-off to the mid-to-low $50,000 region for BTC, which should be a buying opportunity,” said Lendn CIO John Glover.



Others refer to the decline as a speed bump to even higher prices in the coming months. Optimists are predicting an upward price swing following an upbeat economic forecast, with others eyeing “crowd capitulation” as key to a market bounce in the coming weeks.

Ethereum Turns Inflationary as Fees Remain at Record Lows - DailyCoin


        
Ethereum supply is now inflationary.



The recent asset supply shift follows a recent network activity and fees drop.



Interest appears to be shifting to Layer 2 networks.
Ethereum‘s “ultrasound money” status is under threat. The asset has turned inflationary as fees have plummeted in recent weeks.Ethereum Loses Deflationary Status According to data from ultrasound.money, Ethereum’s supply is now inflationary, with a growth rate of 0.56% per day.ETH supply dashboardSource: Ultrasound.moneyThe recent supply shift comes as low fees have led to a decrease in Ethereum burns, the primary means by which the asset reduces its supply. Over the past 24 hours, the network has burnt only 670 ETH, a new low for 2024, down from an average of over 2,500 in the first four months of 2024.
These burns come from the base fee paid by Ethereum users per transaction. This fee is determined by network activity, rising when the activity is high and dropping when the activity is low. Over the past 30 days, Ethereum has averaged a base fee of 13.3 gwei, far below the 23.2 gwei Ultrasound.money identifies as the minimum level required for the asset to achieve deflationary status, signaling low network activity on the leading DeFi network.ETH gas fee dashboardSource: Ultrasound.moneyEthereum’s low activity comes as Layer 2 chains and competing networks like Solana are gaining increased attention. The former results from the recent Dencun upgrade, making fees significantly lower on Ethereum scaling solutions.
Unlike Bitcoin, the largest digital asset by market capitalization, Ethereum does not have a finite supply, implying that its value can theoretically be diluted over time. This feature makes the asset’s deflationary mechanism essential to preserve and support value increase over time.On the Flipside 
Ethereum will likely turn deflationary again when activity picks up.



Low fees are favorable for the everyday Ethereum user.
Why This MattersEthereum’s deflationary status is a key point of interest for long-term investors seeking to preserve and gain value from holding the asset over time.Read this for more on Ethereum:Michael Saylor Warns SEC to Flag ETH, ADA, SOL as SecuritiesLearn more about Bitcoin’s recent price action:BTC Wows With Incredible $10K Jump: Will the Rally Continue?

Solana congestion culprit Ore wins $50K from hackathon - Blockworks


On Monday, the experimental currency Ore won $50,000 from a Solana Foundation-supported hackathon focused on identifying Solana’s “next wave of high-impact projects.”
“High-impact” presumably refers to Ore’s potential for making a positive change to Solana’s adoption figures. But so far, Ore’s impact has been more like a gut punch: The project halted mining in mid-April after the avalanche of network usage from mining the currency made it difficult for Solana users to get their transactions included in blocks.
Ore is an experiment in using the proof-of-work security mechanism on the Solana blockchain. PoW systems essentially pay miners native currency rewards in exchange for computing power that makes blockchains difficult to attack. Bitcoin is secured in this fashion, in contrast to Solana, which combines a system called proof-of-history with proof-of-stake, Ethereum’s chosen consensus mechanism. 
Read more: Solana price falls further as Ore suspends mining on the network
Ore rewrote a more egalitarian version of the Bitcoin protocol as a Solana smart contract, the project’s pseudonymous creator Hardhat Chad explained in a demo video. Unlike Bitcoin, which gives 3.125 bitcoin to the fastest miner to return a certain cryptographic hash every ten minutes, Ore is set up where multiple miners can win a sliver of the network’s block rewards. An average of one ORE is created every minute, split between successful miners.
For many in Solana’s speculation-loving ecosystem, the idea of “Bitcoin on Solana” was simply too juicy to pass up, and Ore mining transactions drove up activity and soon clogged the network. One miner posted about “blindly sending millions” of transactions every second in hopes that some would land.
Amid the flurry of usage, Solana users saw more and more of their transactions being dropped rather than included in blocks, and Solana developers rushed to patch the overloaded network. Perhaps mercifully, Ore temporarily ceased mining on April 16. Soon after, Solana released a network upgrade to help ease the congestion.

In an X post announcing the mining pause, Hardhat Chad said Ore had become Solana’s most-used program by transaction count within two weeks of launching. Solana could thank Ore for the stress test, but the project would be redeploying a better-constructed v2, the developer intimated.
Ore mostly disappeared from view before winning the “Solana Renaissance” hackathon, which was judged by key figures in Solana’s ecosystem, including the chain’s co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal. Colosseum, which runs Solana hackathons including this one and makes venture investments in some of the winners, has said the contest drew over 1,000 entries. The Solana Foundation, a non-profit supporting Solana’s ecosystem, is a limited partner in Colosseum’s venture fund.
Solana’s thought leadership seems to believe a second iteration of Ore can be less chaotic than the first go-round. 
“The network should handle anything like this,” Jon Wong, ecosystem engineering lead at the Solana Foundation, told Blockworks. “It’s not about Ore in particular, it’s about continuous stress testing the network in order to get better.”
Hardhat Chad is optimistic as well.
“Ore exists for one reason: to provide the world with a fast, cheap, private, inflation-proof digital currency everyone can mine,” Hardhat Chad wrote on X in celebration of the hackathon win.
Ore v2 is “[f]eature complete” and currently running simulations while awaiting audits, Hardhat Chad said Monday. 
Those who got their hands on the Ore that was mined before the halt are growing richer in the meantime. The token’s price rose more than 90% Monday after the announcement, according to CoinGecko, trading hands at around $228 at press time.

Bitcoin Is Down, But These Analysts Still Think BTC Hits $150K This Year - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin may be trading below its 2021 record high of $69,044, mired in the doldrums after setting an all-time high of in March, but that doesn’t mean the price can’t double by the end of 2025—or even sooner.That’s according to analysts at investment firm AllianceBernstein, who said in a Monday report that they “feel even better” about their $150,000 price prediction for the biggest cryptocurrency.The analysts at the leading financial firm set the optimistic mark last year. Despite current market conditions, they see a long bull run ahead.“We believe we are in mere first quartile of this cycle, and the market has another 15-18 months before we consider this market topping out,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote. They are not the only experts that say $150,000 is within sight.British multinational bank Standard Chartered said last month that the ETFs will continue to be popular and included in broader macro funds, which will lead to the price of the cryptocurrency to rocket to $150,000 by the end of this year. The analysts from both firms saw the January launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs as a key driver.“ETF issuers continue to provide positive feedback from their dialogues with asset allocators, and this cycle we have seen the best institutional marketing engines at work (aka BlackRock, Fidelity),” the Bernstein pair wrote.They also argued that demand for the newly approved ETFs will continue, thus further driving up the price of the digital coin. The funds saw both low lows and high highs just last week.Back in January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission finally authorized 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing them to trade on stock exchanges. The funds have drawn a flood of capital into the market as ordinary investors sought exposure to the cryptocurrency via brokerage accounts offered by traditional financial firms like VanEck, BlackRock, and Fidelity.Buoyed by ETF fever, the price of Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $73,747 two months ago, but has since struggled, dropping below $57,000 last week. BTC is now trading at a little over $63,000 per coin, according to CoinGecko. Over the weekend, however, ETF outflows reversed course as money again flooded into the funds. The recent upward trajectory “cleaned up the excess leverage on futures contracts on crypto exchanges,” the Bernstein analysts said, suggesting that it’s only up from here.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

                        The Floki Inu (FLOKI) price is under pressure on Monday as weekend optimism in the crypto market succumbs to caution, with investors instead stacking an exciting new GambleFi token called Mega Dice (DICE).FLOKI was last down close to 5% on the day and trading just to the south of $0.00018.The meme coin has once again found strong resistance at its 50DMA, suggesting the bulls are yet to regain control.Chart analysis suggests things are looking good for a potential near-term push higher, however.Bullish Chart Analysis – Floki Isn’t Going to Zero Anytime Soon
In late April, the Floki price snapped its downtrend from its March highs.It then proceeded to find strong support at this prior downtrend at the start of May, which is a very bullish sign.The Floki price turned bullish after this breakout last month. Source: TradingViewAdditionally, the Floki price appears to have spent the last few weeks forming an ascending triangle, which tends to form ahead of bullish breakouts.Assuming FLOKI can soon burst above $0.00020, a quick retest of March highs above $0.00030 would be possible.The Floki price could soon challenge recent highs if it can break above this resistance area. Source: TradingViewBullish short-term technicals and long-term tailwinds like Floki’s strong community suggest that Floki isn’t going to zero soon.FLOKI is still a highly speculative crypto to invest in, however. Its bloated $1.7 billion market cap suggests that, while there is still room for upside, any such gains will be hard fought.Meme coins like Floki lack obvious utility, meaning that they can quickly dump as pessimism sets in.It’s no wonder that Floki investors are turning to a new utility-packed GambleFi token called Mega Dice.Floki Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice (DICE)
Crypto investors looking for investments with greater upside potential than Floki should check out presale investing.Web3 projects and protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to raise funds for development.If presale investors can find a good project that gains traction in the market, they can book exponential gains.One project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is Mega Dice Casino.This already well-established crypto casino has launched a presale of its utility token, DICE.DICE holders get big cashback benefits on their wagers and can generate passive income via DICE staking.The crypto casino is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors.The project has already raised $700,000.Potential investors may want to move quickly, as the DICE price will rise when the $1 million milestone is hit.Mega Dice is also running a referral scheme.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presale

Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY) to Rally Over 6,000% After Solana Launch, as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Solana Doggy presents a similar opportunity.



Solana Doggy has a market cap around $13,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 6,000% in the coming two days, and Solana Doggy could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Solana Doggy can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Solana Doggy on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Solana Doggy by entering its contract address – 3f3XRScU3PnaXvsZ4ZGjxDa15SmbhWeMLxHmSyNngaAE – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SOLDOGGY.

Central banks must revise business model, embrace CBDCs - ECB member

Central banks’ future depends on a revision of their business model and speedy adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), said Joachim Nagel, president of the Bundesbank and member of the European Central Bank (ECB).Nagel reportedly warned about the uncertainty surrounding central banks during a panel session at the Innovation Summit hosted by the Bank for International Settlements on May 6. “If you would have asked me 20 years ago if the central bank business model” was “destroyable or not, I would have said no,” he reportedly stated in Basel, Switzerland. Nagel continued: “Now I am not so sure anymore — and that is the reason why we are sitting here. We need to work on our business model. And DLT is just a means, an instrument that could help us here to get to that point.”The Bundesbank chief stressed the importance of integrating distributed ledger technology as physical money loses its appeal. “We need to speed up on all this [...]. If part of your core product is losing attractiveness, then you have to think about another new core product,” Nagel stated. Source: BISFrench ECB member Francois Villeroy de Galhau also discussed central banks and emerging technologies. Earlier during the BIS conference, Galhau reportedly suggested the banks consider using digital currencies for wholesale and retail transactions:“The way we make central bank money available has to be geared to the 21st century to ensure that central bank money maintains its fundamental role: this role is not to be the dominant means of payment, but a stability anchor for the financial system. This is why I believe that, sooner or later, we will need a central bank digital currency for wholesale as well as for retail purposes.”The ECB is currently developing a digital version of the euro, having completed its investigation phase in order to determine its design and technical details. The ECB expects to complete the project by October 2025.Magazine: $3.4B of Bitcoin in a popcorn tin — The Silk Road hacker’s story

                        With major cryptocurrencies choppy on Monday as traders assess the durability of the recent strong rebound from last week’s multi-week/month lows, traders are scouring the altcoin markets for the best crypto to buy today for fast gains.Bitcoin (BTC) was last changing hands just above its 21DMA in the upper $63,000s, having rallied to $65,500 earlier – more than 12% rebound from last week’s mid-$56,000 lows.And that rebound comes amid a sudden resurgence of inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs last Friday.As per data presented by The Block, net inflows totaled $378 million, the highest in over a month.Bitcoin might be the best crypto to buy today as ETF inflows flip back to positive. Source: The BlockEven GBTC saw an inflow of $63 million, its first since converting into a convertible spot ETF.Coupled with the strong price rebound, the news has conveyed that dip-buying demand for BTC is strong.In a weekend note, Bernstein analysts reiterated their prediction that Bitcoin will reach $150,000 by the end of 2025.According to the analysts, the recent pullback “cleaned up the excess leverage on futures contracts on crypto exchanges.”“Metrics indicate a healthy cycle, still in its early stages… Risk-reward here remains attractive,” they added.For what it’s worth, open interest in the Bitcoin futures market has seen a substantial fall from earlier yearly highs.As per coinglass.com, open interest is at $29.17 billion, versus over $36 billion in late March.Open interest in the Bitcoin futures market has dropped substantially, suggesting less leverage currently in the system. Source: coinglass.comBitcoin could still increase more than 2x from current levels, making it the best crypto to buy today.But for impatient traders looking to make faster gains, altcoin markets might be a more attractive investment option.While Bitcoin could easily 2-3x this bull market, many smaller and lesser-known altcoins might post 10x or more upside.Here are some strong-performing altcoins on Monday that might be the best crypto to buy today.Best Crypto to Buy TodayEthena (ENA)The native token of the algorithmic, yield-generating stablecoin protocol Ethena (ENA) is performing well on Monday.ENA was last up 7% in 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap at $0.87, with a market cap of $1.25 billion.Ethena is behind the creation of the new USDe algorithmic stablecoin.To generate USDe, users post ETH or BTC as collateral. Ethena maintains the value of its collateral and generates yield by going long and short ETH and BTC.Protocol users can boost the yield they get by locking their ENA.Ethena’s TVL is currently just under $2.3 billion, as per DeFi Llama.USDe’s attractive qualities as a yield-generating stablecoin could soon attract a wave of new interest, however.Ethena’s TVL will likely surpass $10 billion at some point, which could help ENA 5x from current level, making it one of the best crypto to buy today.Jupiter (JUP)Solana’s largest DEX Jupiter (JUP) is also pushing higher on Monday.As per CoinMarketCap, JUP is up a little over 4% in 24 hours.JUP is attempting to push to the north of its recent $0.80-1.20ish range.JUP could be the best crypto to buy today if it can break back to recent highs. Source: TradingViewA break above here could open the door to a run back higher towards $1.90.The prospect of quick gains makes JUP potentially the best crypto to buy today.Solana (SOL)Solana (SOL), the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has pushed back above $150.It was last up 3% in the last 24 hours, the best-performing crypto in the top 20 per CoinMarketCap.Following the token’s double bottom around $120, bulls are hoping this recovery has legs.But before the bulls can claim that local lows are in, SOL needs to push back above support-turned-resistance around $160. This also coincides with the 50DMA.Solana might be the best crypto to buy today if it can break above the $160 resistance. Source: TradingViewAs Solana positions itself for a potential retest of March highs, it could be the best crypto to buy today.Crypto Alternatives to Consider
The above-mentioned altcoins could all deliver quick gains to investors.For those looking for quick gains of over 5x, the often-overlooked strategy of presale investing is worth considering.Up-and-coming web3 projects often raise funds for development via the presale or ICO of their native tokens.These tokens are usually offered at a steep discount, making them attractive to early-bird investors.Presale investing is risky. Projects can fail to deliver on their vision or promises if management or adoption by crypto users fails.If investors can identify projects with a competent team and great use-case, however, presale investing can be very profitable.With so many presales vying for investor funds, it can be difficult to know where to start.That’s why analysts at Cryptonews have compiled a list of their favorite presales.20 Best Crypto Presales to Invest In

How Bitcoin Can Support Nearly 1 Million People in Brazil Floods


To date, authorities have reported more than 100 people missing and 83 dead after storms and rain hit the entire state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) in Brazil since last week. The situation is critical; more than 330 municipalities remain underwater or face other serious problems.
According to the RS Civil Defense, more than 19,000 people are in shelters, almost 122,000 are homeless, and around 850,000 have been affected. The impressive numbers give a dimension to the tragedy. In fact, the warning for heavy rain, with the risk of flooding, remains.
Rains in Brazil Cause Losses of Over $54 Million
With losses estimated at more than $54 million by the National Council of Municipalities (CNM), aid needs to arrive urgently to support the victims of the greatest tragedy in the recent history of Rio Grande do Sul.
A task force between the government of RS, the federal government, several states, including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and even Brazilians outside the country, collects donations and resources to rebuild cities and bring supplies to those affected, especially in hard-to-reach places.
Affected Areas in Brazil Floods: Source: Civil Defense of Rio Grande do Sul
Many regions are without electricity. The latest balance from RS Civil Defense shows 418.2 thousand points without power. Thus, dozens of municipalities lack access to roads, airports, bridges, and basic resources such as water, food, and medicine.  

There are already reports, for example, of shortages in some regions. According to Cemaden (National Center for Monitoring Alerts and Disasters), despite the reduced rains, there is still a risk of flooding in the entire state.

The tension of recent weeks has generated a wave of solidarity and mobilization across the country. Several official bodies, artists, and communities joined forces to raise donations for climate refugees. Furthermore, the Association of Banks in the State of Rio Grande Do Sul made accounts available for donations in reais, dollars, and euros.
For those who have an account in Brazil, make a PIX for the CNPJ key: 92.958.800/0001-38 belonging to the Association of Banks in the State of Rio Grande do Sul or Banco do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (both options may appear).
At the time of writing, the PIX of the government of Rio Grande do Sul – the official channel of the State government – ​​raised around $7.5 million. 

Another official donation channel is “For those who donate.” The website contains information from more than 100 social and non-profit organizations.


For example, one of the cities most affected by the tragedy is the community of Rolante, the most Bitcoiner city in Brazil. Residents and volunteers are united to rebuild all businesses and the main local hospital, which lost all its equipment to the flood. The healthcare institution also accepts Bitcoin.  
Across the state, 110 hospitals were affected. Despite this, 75 are partially functioning, but 17 lack service.
It is Possible To Send Donations In Bitcoin. Here Are The Addresses:

PIX: 51.299.707/0001-81
Bitcoin via Lightning: [email protected]
Bitcoin via SegWit: bc1q4w3mc5uztsznk6v64hwj097umr3p4cepayt6d3


At the same time, Santa Maria resident Gerin.ETH used X (formerly Twitter) to ask for donations for the city of 300,000 inhabitants.Gerin.ETH committed to donating the money to institutions that are helping with the tragedy, posting invoices, and recording the delivery of donations. He, for example, made three trackable Web3 wallets available.

Chave PIX: 3fafb39d-d6b2-45fb-ac5b-83cd009bddbc (BANCO INTER)
Receive EVM (possible for L2 USDC/USDT): 0xff35352F229F0275c0A0FFe727956d4b80DFDE74
Solana Address (if possible, donate USDC/USDT): 7Ke8usysxqmytwBnmhewaePyQFBCuFFmnFmiXNk9CNX1


In addition to the community’s efforts, Bitso, a crypto exchange, also joined the campaign to raise donations. The exchange started an emergency campaign and is committed to doubling donations. This means the company will donate $1 for every $1 donation by its customers.
Valid until May 12, the action also accepts cryptocurrencies. To donate, make a transfer via the Bitso app (Bitso Transfer) in any cryptocurrency to [email protected]. The process takes a few seconds and guarantees the exchange.
At the end of the campaign, Bitso will convert all the amount donated in cryptocurrencies into reais and deposit the amount in full into the SOS Rio Grande do Sul account. Finally, the platform will also account for the funds raised.

Why Ethereum Game ‘Fantasy Top’ Is Taking Over Crypto Twitter - Decrypt

What’s Crypto Twitter buzzing about now? A game built around Crypto Twitter, believe it or not—one offering sizable rewards and incentives for players.Fantasy Top is captivating the crypto faithful by transforming the industry’s biggest and buzziest social media personalities into Ethereum NFT trading cards on scaling network Blast. Players can crush rivals by creating card lineups that have the best real-world Twitter engagement during each competition, and earn crypto and in-game prizes in return.Crypto’s biggest tweeters have excitedly embraced it, promoting their own in-game cards or sharing their lineups, as well as bragging about how much their NFTs have surged in value in a short period of time. They’re even forming private groups of holders to discuss strategies and incentivize buyers.Launched on Blast mainnet on May 1 by pseudonymous creator Travis Bickle, Fantasy Top is effectively Sorare if it were built around outspoken crypto personalities and traders rather than professional soccer players. The influencers in question earn a small cut of each trade of their own cards, along with other perks—but many appear to have invested significantly into building their own lineups, too.The list of in-game NFT “heroes” includes meme coin trader of the moment Ansem, 9dcc founder Gmoney, Blast founder Pacman, famed weird tweeter Greg16676935420, DeGods creator Frank, whale NFT traders Pranksy and Machi Big Brother, and even Su Zhu—the co-founder of collapsed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.Farokh Sarmad of Rug Radio, which is merging with Decrypt, is another one of the featured personalities.It’s about more than just buying the NFTs of crypto traders you like and putting them in a lineup for each competition, however. There are multiple rarity levels to cards, including the ability to trade up multiple lower-level cards to unlock a higher level, which provides a points boost in each competition.There’s another curious wrinkle to consider: Scoring is based on your lineup’s actual social media engagement, which raises the question of what counts as quality engagement—and how that could potentially be manipulated.Some of the most expensive cards in Fantasy Top. Image: DecryptOne “hero” in question, content creator Jenn Duong, temporarily put her Twitter account private on Sunday after noticing that one of her Twitter videos had abnormally large engagement numbers. She suggested that users were “botting” her content, or artificially inflating the engagement, which she feared would cause potential issues with her own play.“People don't want to play fair and I'm not going to risk messing up my X algo,” she tweeted, adding: “Please do not bot my shit. I don't need it. I'm betting on me, and I want to win on my own merit.“You're fucking up the systems for other creators,” she added.But the Fantasy Top hype continues unabated, and arguably hit a fever peak early Monday with the announcement of the prize pool for the first “Main Competition” that just began: over $150,000 worth of Ethereum (50 ETH), plus 222,222 Blast Gold that will lead to an airdrop allocation for the network—along with card packs and other in-game rewards.While 50 ETH is no small change for a crypto game that launched last week, the far bigger prize could come from the Blast Gold. Crypto industry observers estimate the value of each Blast Gold above $10, putting that part of the prize pool potentially well above $2 million in total.Players scrambled to buy up cards on the Fantasy Top marketplace, generating millions of dollars’ worth of trading on scaling network Blast in the process—equaling more than 50% of the total trading volume on Ethereum mainnet early Monday.A Flipside Crypto dashboard from analyst Hildobby shows over 7,000 ETH worth of NFT trading volume (over $21 million worth at the current price) and over 31,000 total users this week.Fantasy Top has been a shot in the arm for Crypto Twitter denizens, resuscitating the positive vibes that have been missing in recent weeks amid a market lull. But we’ll see whether a fantasy sports riff featuring Twitter influencers has the depth and intrigue to maintain momentum after the initial novelty and Blast network incentives fade.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

German central bank president calls for swift adoption of CBDCs to stay competitive.

Joachim Nagel, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank and a member of the ECB, emphasized the urgency for central banks to reassess their business models and swiftly adopt central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).Speaking at a high-level panel during the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Summit on May 6, Nagel expressed concern over the uncertain future facing central banks. He noted a significant shift in perspective, saying:“If you would have asked me 20 years ago if the central bank business model was destroyable or not, I would have said no. Now I am not so sure anymore.”Nagel stressed the necessity for central banks to adapt to the evolving landscape, identifying distributed ledger technology (DLT) as a crucial tool in this transformation. He added:“We need to work on our business model. And DLT is just a means, an instrument that could help us here to get to that point.”Nagel also emphasized the importance of swift action due to the diminishing appeal of physical currency. He said:“We need to speed up on all this. If part of your core product is losing attractiveness, then you have to think about another new core product.”Evolving for the 21st centuryBank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau echoed Nagel’s sentiments, advocating for the integration of digital currencies into central bank operations. He, too, emphasized the need for central bank money to evolve in line with 21st-century demands, advocating for CBDCs to maintain stability within the financial system.The ECB is currently in the process of developing a digital version of the euro, with plans to finalize the project by October 2025. This initiative marks a significant step towards embracing the potential of digital currencies in the modern financial landscape.In parallel, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) recently revealed its pilot project, Project Helvetia III, which aims to explore the use of wholesale CBDC. Thomas J. Jordan, Chairman of the governing board of the Swiss National Bank, emphasized the importance of central bank money in ensuring financial stability and reinforcing its role as a cornerstone of the monetary system.However, Jordan cautioned against the issuance of a retail CBDC because it could destabilize the financial system. He added that the potential risks of retail CBDCs outweigh the benefits. Instead, he advocated for the use of wholesale CBDC to facilitate the secure and efficient settlement of tokenized assets.

Massive Dormant Bitcoin Whale Resurfaces After BTC Appreciates over 17,000% in a Decade | Cryptoglobe


                                
Over this past weekend the cryptocurrency space saw a significant recovery, with Bitcoin (BTC) briefly topping the $65,000 mark before enduring a correction, and within that period a massive Bitcoin whale resurfaced after a decade of inactivity.



That Bitcoin whale notably moved funds from an address containing around $43.8 million worth of the flagship cryptocurrency from a Bitcoin address that had been dormant for little over 10 years.



The transaction was first spotted by Whale Alert, a whale monitoring service that posts large transactions on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Data from the blockchain shows the whale was last active in 2014, when BTC was trading at around $360 per token. It has appreciated over 17,000% since then.







Movements by these “whales” – institutions or individuals holding massive crypto reserves – are closely watched due to their potential to influence market prices, with the Bitcoin blockchain being open to everyone and allowing for large transactions to be easily monitored.



Speculation on social media swirled about the owner’s motives. Some considered it “suspicious,” while others offered creative explanations, suggesting the owner might have been recently released from prison. It’s worth adding that in Bitcoin’s early days, many adopters were those involved in darknet market buying and selling illicit goods with the cryptocurrency.



The transaction notably comes at a time in which cryptocurrency whales have accumulated nearly 47,000 Bitcoins in the past day worth around $2.9 billion, according to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The data, shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) by the company’s founder and CEO Ki Young Ju, shows the balances of cryptocurrency whales last active over the past 24-hour period surged exponentially, with the CEO saying “we’re entering a new era” as a result.



As CryptoGlobe reported some institutions may be among those buying the dip, as BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe whose asset management arm has over $600 billion in assets under management, has gained exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin via a spot exchange-traded fund.



According to a recent 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the bank has purchased shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), as first reported by Bitcoin Magazine.



Large institutional investors managing over $100 million in assets have to, every quarter, disclose their holdings via 13F filings and after the successful launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., these filings have been closely watched by industry sleuths.



Notably, an executive at BlackRock has revealed sovereign wealth funds are showing interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF, and could start trading it over the next few months.



Such an investment would show a significantly different attitude towards digital assets. Foreign wealth funds like Kuwait’s Invstment Authority (KIA), the oldest sovereign wealth fund in the world, and Norway’s well-known $1.6 trillion wealth fund, could make ripples in the market with even conservative allocations.

Bitcoin Wallet Maker Exodus Jumping Up to New York Stock Exchange - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsExodus Movement, the software developer behind the Exodus Wallet for Bitcoin, got the green light to list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, the company said on Monday.The EXOD ticker on the NYSE comes as government regulators are stepping up enforcement actions against cryptocurrency projects and developers. While that's certainly a cause for concern, Exodus CEO and co-founder JP Richardson said EXOD was qualified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and can also trade on NYSE American, formerly known as the American Stock Exchange (AMEX).“What's really cool about this is that our common stock is tokenized on the Algorand (ALGO) blockchain, and so we're the only company in the United States that has our common stock tokenized on the blockchain,” Richardson told Decrypt. “That's true today, and that will be true on Thursday as well.”SEC qualification means the company has been approved to offer and sell shares of its Class A common stock to investors under Regulation A of the Securities Act, which in turn allows Exodus to raise capital from the public in a regulated manner.Exodus became a publicly traded company in 2021, listing its stock with broker-dealer tZero. The sale of the common stock began on April 8, and by April 13, 2021, Exodus had raised $60 million.Currently traded on the OTCQX exchange, the EXOD stock will continue to be available there until May 8, the company said, and will begin trading on the NYSE American on May 9.Richardson said the benefit of tokenizing the EXOD stock is making it easier and fasters for investors to trade the stock.“It works just as simple as cryptocurrency which is phenomenal from a usability standpoint,” he said. “Beyond that, when you think of implications like dividend payouts, we could pay out dividends with USDC to stockholders on a blockchain.“We could have governance and voting directly on the blockchain with stock, so corporate governance,” he added.Despite the SEC’s crackdown on cryptocurrency, Richardson said he optimistic about the future of publicly traded digital assets, calling it a new era of stocks being tokenized on the blockchain.

“We want to see a future where eventually, traditional stocks are powered by the blockchain,” he said. “I think that's what's so great about all this hard work that we're doing.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Kenya taps US Bitcoin mining giant Marathon Digital for crypto regime and mining consultation - Crypto Briefing




Kenya’s President William Ruto has appointed Marathon Digital, a prominent US Bitcoin mining firm, to provide consultancy services on the nation’s crypto policies and the energy requirements associated with crypto mining, according to Kenyan Wall Street, a local digital-first media house that focuses on business and finance.With this appointment, Marathon Digital and Kenya’s National Treasury and Ministry of Energy will collaborate and discuss the energy needs for crypto mining, President Ruto announced the partnership at a meeting with American investors in Nairobi last week.Additionally, the US mining leader will support the government in developing a framework for crypto in Kenya.Starting as a patent holding company, Marathon Digital has transformed into a major player in the crypto mining space, with a focus on Bitcoin, since 2021 under its new leadership and strategic direction. The company is one of the largest Bitcoin miners in North America.State of digital assets in KenyaKenya currently lacks clear regulations for crypto trading and usage, despite being one of the leading African countries in crypto adoption and usage. Chainalysis’ 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index shows that the country ranks second in Africa and 21st globally.The latest development signals a move away from the Central Bank of Kenya’s (CBK) previous hardline stance against digital currencies. In 2015, the CBK issued warnings about crypto risks, including lack of legal tender status, anonymity, volatility, and potential for criminal activity.The CBK also explored the idea of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). However, it determined that a CBDC is not currently a pressing need.While Kenya has explored crypto regulations, another African nation, Angola, recently banned Bitcoin mining.

Coinbase Faces Lawsuit for Alleged Deception in Selling Unregistered Securities


																Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange and its CEO, Brian Armstrong, are facing a new lawsuit from a group of plaintiffs from California and Florida alleging that they were deceived into purchasing unregistered securities.
This is not the first of Coinbase’s legal hurdles following the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit from mid-2023.
Lawsuit Alleges Coinbase Sold Unregistered Securities
The new class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division. The plaintiffs include Gerardo Aceves, Thomas Fan, Edwin Martinez, Tiffany Smoot, Edouard Cordi, and Brett Maggard.
The lawsuit contends that Coinbase exchange acknowledged in its user agreement that it operated as a securities asset broker. In addition, the plaintiffs claimed that Coinbase Prime brokerage was highlighted as a securities broker.
However, despite this acknowledgment, it continued to provide access to assets such as Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Near Protocol (NEAR), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Uniswap (UNI), Tezos (XTZ), and Stellar Lumen (XLM), which the lawsuit claims are unregistered securities.




The plaintiffs are pursuing complete rescission, statutory damages under state law, and injunctive relief via a jury trial.
Coinbase Faces Legal Battles on Multiple Fronts
This recent lawsuit differs from Coinbase’s widely discussed legal dispute with the SEC, which also raises questions about whether tokens offered on the exchange should be categorized as securities. Notably, the firm recently lodged an interlocutory appeal in response to a judge’s ruling permitting the case to proceed.
John Deaton, a cryptocurrency lawyer engaged in an election campaign to challenge Senator Elizabeth Warren at this time, recently stepped in to support Coinbase.
In an April 26 submission to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Deaton submitted an amicus brief endorsing a motion for interlocutory appeal on behalf of 4,701 Coinbase clients.
In a separate matter, numerous Coinbase customers have initiated legal action against the company concerning its management of the GYEN stablecoin, which they assert was anything but stable. According to this lawsuit, Coinbase actively promoted and traded the GYEN token despite knowing its high volatility, resulting in major losses for investors.
Furthermore, Coinbase’s crypto staking has attracted regulatory concerns. The SEC contends that it is an unregistered investment contract and security. Several states within the U.S. have joined the SEC’s lawsuit, alleging that Coinbase breached securities laws in relation to its staking rewards program.

Smart Whale Activity Signals Bullish Trends for Shiba Inu as Major Purchases Uncovered



                    

Tracking the activities of highly capitalized crypto addresses, often referred to as “smart whales,” can offer critical insights for traders and investors in the volatile cryptocurrency market.



A notable example occurred on May 1, when an anonymous wallet completed a significant transaction on the Robinhood exchange by purchasing 1.75 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens for about $40 million. 




According to Whale Alert, this large buy involved two quick transfers, each moving 875 billion SHIB within a minute. 



The funds moved from Robinhood to the wallet address ‘0x73AF3bcf944a6559933396c1577B257e2054D935,’ which has frequently interacted with SHIB on Robinhood, indicating sustained involvement in its market dynamics.



Earlier, on April 24, this wallet transferred 3 trillion SHIB into Robinhood, exhibiting a consistent pattern of significant transactions with the exchange. 




This strategic trading behavior underscores the wallet’s substantial market impact, as it currently holds over 5.88 trillion SHIB, now worth around $128 million.



The trading activities of such addresses are crucial in shaping market trends.

Professional crypto trader Ali Martinez highlighted this in a recent X post, noting, “Shiba Inu appears to be forming a bull flag on its daily chart.” 




This pattern suggests a potential price increase. Martinez plans to capitalize on this by placing buy orders at $0.000018343, anticipating a bullish breakout to $0.000072323.



Despite recent market downturns, the ongoing trading fervor around SHIB, especially on platforms like Binance’s Japanese arm—which has introduced new SHIB trading pairs—illustrates a sustained interest. Currently, SHIB’s daily trading volume has surged by 40%, signaling robust trading activity.



At the moment, SHIB is trading at $0.00002363, marking a 3.18% rise in the last 24 hours. 



This price movement and high volume of trades reflect a dynamic market environment. 



Market experts continue to project a bullish future for SHIB, positioning it as an attractive asset for those seeking to diversify into cryptocurrencies.



As the digital asset landscape evolves, it remains essential for investors and analysts to monitor such trends and movements closely to refine their investment strategies in this ever-changing market.

Solana's (SOL) Most Important Breakthrough in 2024, Ethereum (ETH) Struggling, XRP Forms Important Pattern

Solana has recently made what many investors and analysts are calling the most important breakthrough of 2024. The asset has successfully broken through a key trendline resistance that had been instrumental in keeping it in a downtrend for an extended period.This breakthrough is particularly significant as it signals a potential reversal of the bearish trend that Solana has been experiencing. The crossing of this trendline could serve as a strong catalyst for future gains, infusing confidence among investors about the asset's upward trajectory. Following this key development, Solana is now facing the next challenge, which is the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).SOL/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe 26 EMA has historically acted as a tough resistance level, and a decisive move above this could confirm the bullish momentum. Currently, Solana is trading around $146.82, with immediate resistance from the 26 EMA observed just above this price level. Overcoming this would likely open the path toward the 50-day EMA, which is situated around $163.29.If Solana manages to sustain its position above these EMAs, it could further validate the strength of its current market recovery. This scenario not only reflects a significant technical victory but also potentially marks the beginning of a new bullish phase for Solana.Ethereum is strugglingEthereum is currently in a challenging phase as it contends with several crucial moving averages on its price chart. At present, ETH is striving to surpass the 26-day moving average, which is a short-term gauge of its price momentum.The recent price chart indicates that after potentially overcoming the 26 CMA hurdle, ETH will face the next significant resistance at the 50-day moving average (AMA). These moving averages are key indicators watched by traders to assess potential reversals or confirmations in the market trend.If Ethereum manages to break above the 50 AMA, it would likely pave the way for a move toward earlier highs around $4,000. This is not an all-time high for the cryptocurrency but represents a critical recovery point from previous sell-offs. Turning to the volume, it appears to be stable, with no clear signs of an upward or downward trend, suggesting neutral market sentiment. Similarly, the Relative Strength Index, positioned at around 50, indicates a balanced condition between buyers and sellers without leaning toward an overbought or oversold market state.At this level, the price of ETH is not demonstrating a clear directional trend and appears to be consolidating, moving sideways as it gathers strength for a potential upward movement. This consolidation phase is critical as it provides the market and investors time to align on the future direction of the asset.On the chart, notable resistance can be seen at around $3,200, following the current level of approximately $3,120. Support, on the other hand, is established near the $2,900 mark, providing a cushion should any downward pressure emerge.XRP's new patternXRP is currently in a symmetrical triangle pattern, showing a potential volatility surge in the foreseeable future. This technical formation often indicates a period of consolidation ahead of a significant price breakout in either direction.At present, XRP's price hovers around $0.55, showing a delicate balance between supply and demand. The symmetrical triangle suggests that the asset is compressing and a breakout is imminent. The direction, however, remains unclear due to mixed signals from other technical indicators.A concerning development alongside the triangle pattern is the looming possibility of a "death cross." This occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, traditionally a bearish signal for traders. Should this event materialize, it could potentially accelerate a downtrend for XRP.On the other hand, the formation of the triangle itself often precedes a reversal. This possibility suggests that if XRP can navigate through the turbulence of the death cross, there may be an opportunity for a bullish reversal. Support levels are currently found around $0.50, which has historically provided a bounce back point during bearish trends. Resistance lies near the $0.60 mark, a breach of which could set the stage for a move toward higher resistances.

SEC punts Galaxy spot Ethereum ETF decision to July

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on Galaxy Invesco’s application for a spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF).In a May 6 filing, the SEC gave itself another 60 days to make a call on the Galaxy’s ETF, with the next deadline set to July 5.“The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,” the SEC wrote. Highlighted excerpt of the SEC’s reasoning for delaying deciding on the Galaxy Invesco Ether ETF. Source: SECIn recent months the SEC has delayed decisions on applications from all eight prospective Ether ETF issuers including BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Hashdex, and Ark 21Shares — in line with analyst expectations.May 23 is the final deadline for VanEck’s Ether ETF application and the “only deadline that matters” said Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart in a March 20 X post.Deadlines for the Ether ETF applications before the SEC. Source: James Seyffart/XIn March, Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas downgraded his odds of the SEC approving the ETFs from 50% to 35% — being less convinced the regulator would approve VanEck’s bid by the final deadline.Related: SEC will classify Ether as security, deny spot Ether ETFs — Michael SaylorSpeaking to Cointelegraph on March 12, Balchunas looked to a prolonged period of “radio silence” from the SEC to prospective fund issuers, combined with increasing political pushback for SEC Chair Gary Gensler as reasons for the decreasing likelihood of approval.Seyffart said his “cautiously optimistic” attitude toward the pending Ether ETF applications had changed. As of March 20, he expects that all applications for an Ether ETF will “ultimately be denied” by the SEC on May 23.Despite this consensus from ETF analysts, Ethereum advocate Anthony Sassano said he maintains conviction that the regulator could approve the funds by VanEck’s final deadline.Sassano looked to the agency’s approval of Ether futures ETF products last year and cited a March 9 meeting between the regulator, crypto asset management firm Grayscale, and crypto exchange Coinbase as further reasons for why the SEC could still approve the applications.

Crypto Analyst Says Cardano Bloodbath Far From Over, Sets Bottom Price For ADA


                            Cardano has recovered from its April lows and continues to maintain a strong momentum above $0.45. This has prompted expectations that the altcoin will go on a rally from here. However, not everyone shares this sentiment as one crypto analyst expects the price to crash further from here.
Cardano Will Crash Back Below $0.45
In the latest video on his YouTube channel that revolved around Cardano’s future trajectory, crypto analyst, ‘More Crypto Online’, revealed why the ADA price is poised for more decline. The analyst pointed out that the altcoin is currently in its 3-wave corrective rally.

Now, the Elliot Wave Theory which is being referred to by the crypto analyst consists of five waves. Out of the five, three are bullish and two are bearish. The bullish waves involve the 1, 3, and 5, with 2 and 4 being bearish waves.
If the analyst is correct and the Cardano price has only completed three waves so far, that means the fourth wave, which is a bearish wave, is yet to be established. As a result, the crypto analyst believes that the Cardano price will further break down as it enters the fourth wave.
He further pointed out that the altcoin’s price had fallen below the $0.48 support, which was an important level for it. This, coupled with the fact that it is yet to enter the fourth wave, has the analyst convinced that the price crash is far from over.
As for where the ADA price might end up in this fourth wave, the crypto analyst believes it will go as low as $0.42 before recovering again. However, the good news is that once the fourth wave is completed, it gives way for the fifth wave to begin, which is the most bullish of all the waves and could see the ADA price barrel past $1.
ADA Metrics Still Bullish
Despite the bearish outlook presented by the crypto analyst, major Cardano metrics continue to show bullish divergence. For example, the daily trading volume of the altcoin has risen almost 17% in the last day to cross $286 million, data from CoinMarketCap shows.

This drastic rise in daily trading volume suggests a return of interest in the altcoin and this could quickly translate to a bullish trend, especially in the short term. Additionally, the fact that the price is on the rise at this time suggests that the majority of the transactions as a result of this renewed interest is from buyers rather than sellers. This suggests that the price will continue to rise if this demand is sustained.
At the time of writing, ADA is still sitting firmly above $0.45, with a 1.78% increase in the last day.

Trader Calls Memecoin One of Strongest Altcoins, Updates Outlook on Dogecoin and Three Other Crypto Assets - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist says one Dogecoin (DOGE) challenger is way ahead of its fellow altcoins.
Pseudonymous analyst Cred tells his 624,100 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on the frog-themed memecoin Pepe (PEPE).










According to the crypto strategist, PEPE is leading the altcoin pack in terms of market structure as the memecoin moves close to its all-time high even after last month’s marketwide correction.
“PEPE: one of the strongest alts, ahead of several of the others by virtue of breaking its range high (vs. Bonk and Doge, which are still technically testing their respective resistances).” 
Source: Cred/X
At time of writing, PEPE is $0.00000865, less than 20% away from its all-time high of $0.0000106.
Looking at Dogecoin, Cred says that DOGE will likely lose steam if it retests its immediate support at $0.147.
“One of those instances where reaching the best support would make the chart look quite ugly, so options are to hope for low time frame/shallow pullbacks, or breakout chase.” 
Source: Cred/X
At time of writing, DOGE is worth $0.162, very close to the analyst’s next breakout level.
As for fellow memecoin Bonk (BONK), Cred says the altcoin looks bullish as long as it trades above its range midpoint at $0.000025.
“Strong off the lows, at local range high. Shallow pullback and/or breakout punts preferable. Retracing the reclaim back to the range low would be a tough look.”
Source: Cred/X
At time of writing, BONK is trading at $0.0000262.
The last coin on the trader’s list is dogwifhat (WIF). According to the analyst, WIF is in the midst of a new uptrend with invalidation below $3.
“Assuming one-day close doesn’t get stuffed, this move would signify a daily time frame higher high + move back into the former range.
Same area would act as line in the sand for bias i.e. sub $3.” 
Source: Cred/X
At time of writing, WIF is worth $3.37.

This Is Why Dogecoin Could Climb Another 25% Soon


Dogecoin’s DOGE price has recovered from the lows of $0.12 after dipping to it at the beginning of May. 
Although the meme coin leader is stuck under the barrier of $0.16, it could be cleared.
Dogecoin Price Rise Anticipated
Dogecoin’s price is noting a surge in bullishness at the hands of investors. Traders can be seen setting up long contracts, which has resulted in the Open Interest rising by close to $200 million in the span of two days.
Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts at a given time, providing insight into market activity and potential future price movements. It reflects the total volume of active positions yet to be closed, indicating market sentiment and liquidity.

OI increase can also be associated with a surge in short contracts. However, considering the positive funding rate, the increase is due to long contracts.
Dogecoin Open Interest. Source: Coinglass
This rise could be coming soon since, despite the recent recovery, Dogecoin’s price still has considerable room to grow. Of the total circulating supply of DOGE, only 83% is in profit.
Generally, rising profits tend to suggest potential selling. However, that is only when the asset forms a market top. Dogecoin, however, is far from a market top as such an instance is noted only when 95% of the supply is in profit.

DOGE Price Prediction: Recovery

Dogecoin’s price has witnessed resistance at $0.16, a level that has been tested multiple times in the past. Flipping it into support would send prices to $0.18, which is the barrier between DOGE and $0.20. Breaching these resistances would enable a 25% rally, effectively helping the meme coin regain its recent losses.

However, if the breach of this resistance fails, Dogecoin’s price is vulnerable to falling to $0.15. Losing this support could decrease the meme coin to $0.12, invalidating the bullish thesis.

Crypto market stability expected until May 15th, says expert | Cryptopolitan

Daniel Yan, the brains behind Kryptanium Capital, recently shared insights suggesting that the crypto market might see less turbulence leading up to May 15th. According to him, the market’s direction for the latter part of May will heavily depend on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data due on that day. He’s betting big on Solana, AI, and Memes to beat Bitcoin in gains next month.Breaking Down the April Market CrashLet’s dive into why April was rough for crypto. Daniel explained that a couple of big problems hit Bitcoin and Ethereum, and altcoins got the worst of it. First off, inflation stayed high and jobs were too hot in the US, which messed with the bigger economic scene. This led to a massive sell-off in US Treasuries—something that cryptocurrencies are really sensitive to.Next, the Bitcoin ETFs didn’t play nice. People thought they would act like stock ETFs, where investors keep pouring money in no matter what. Turns out, that’s not the case. Folks treated it more like a game—buying high, selling low—which just doesn’t work out well.Then there’s the altcoin mess. They had some serious cash flow problems and a lot of coins were set to be released in May, which crashed their prices big time. We’re talking a 33% drop for the average token, way worse than the 15.5% dip for Bitcoin and Ethereum.Is the Crash Justifiable?Daniel thinks the drop in Bitcoin and Ethereum makes sense, but the altcoin crash was over the top. He mentioned a healthy 15% drop for Bitcoin can happen when the market’s too excited, but a 30-50% crash in altcoins? That’s too much. Last time we saw something this bad was the FTX crash in November 2022 and before that, the Luna crash between April and June 2022.“May will continue to be a very macro month for crypto. The market should behave more calmly from now till 15-May, and the CPI print on the day will dictate the direction of the second half of the month. However for the alts, I think nevertheless we should see outperformances.“Daniel YanSome Good News, FinallyBut hey, there’s some light at the end of the tunnel! The US Treasury kicked off its first bond buyback since 2002. They’re starting small, but they might ramp it up. Plus, the Federal Reserve’s latest statements were pretty mild, and they’re cutting back on how fast they’re pulling money out of the economy, which should help.Also, the job market’s cooling off a bit, with weaker payroll numbers and a tiny bump in unemployment to 3.9%, the highest since March 2022. Thanks to all this, the U.S. Treasury market is finding its footing again. This all helped Bitcoin bounce back more than 10% in just a few days.Daniel’s final take? May should be calm until mid-month, but after that, it’s all up to the CPI numbers. He’s optimistic about Solana, AI, and Memes doing better than Bitcoin. Even with the April shocks, he doesn’t see any big reasons to doubt a strong market in 2024. He thinks last month was a tough lesson but a good one for everyone betting on crypto.

Here's How Bitcoin Miners Performed Last Month After The Halving

                        The largest Bitcoin miners have published their monthly performance figures for the first time since the Bitcoin network’s fourth halving event last month.The impact of the halving on the mining industry has been small thus far but still noticeable.Bitcoin Miners Still Performing Post-Halving
CleanSpark (CLSK) – the second-largest Bitcoin miner by market cap at $3.92 billion – mined 721 BTC in April compared to 806 BTC in March, its monthly investor report states.CLSK is currently one of the best-performing Bitcoin mining stocks year to date, surging 60% while other mining stocks suffered amid pre-halving market fears.Compared to major rivals, the firm has proven most efficient at mining more BTC with a lower energized hash rate, which reached 17 exahashes per second (EH/s) in April.By contrast, Marathon Digital (MARA) – the largest Bitcoin miner worth $5.64 billion – mined a comparable 850 BTC last month, even though its energized hash rate is 50% higher at 29.9 EH/s. Marathon Digital’s April update said its “average operational hash rate” was just 21.1 EH/s, implying that many of its mining machines were not active while they could be.Riot Platforms (RIOT) has proven even less efficient, mining just 375 BTC on a 12.5 EH/s energized hash rate and an 8.8 EH/s average hash rate. RIOT stock was one of the worst hit between early January and the Bitcoin halving on April 19 and has done little to recover post-halving, trading 30% down year to date.Revenue From Runes and Transaction Fees
Several Bitcoin miners saw their BTC revenue drop less than 15% month over month, despite the halving being in effect for roughly one-third of it. B.C.-based miner Iris Energy was able to mine slightly more BTC month over month, thanks to an increase in its operating hash rate over that time.Part of their performance was due to a temporary bump in transaction fee revenue last month spurred by the Runes protocol, which was launched at the same time as the halving. Runes is a new standard for minting tokens on Bitcoin that temporarily drove fees to over $150 apiece as traders raced to mint the tokens on the new standard.Marathon reported earning 16% of its revenue last month through transaction fees. CleanSpark said it earned 48.3 BTC on one day in April, roughly double its monthly average.

                        South Korea’s Bithumb crypto exchange may re-appoint its CEO Lee Jae-won, as the trading platform seeks to complete its planned IPO.Per Business Post, Lee’s two-year term as Bithumb boss expires later this month. But industry figures believe he will be reappointed as the firm tries to fast-track its public offering plans.Trading volumes on South Korea’s Bithumb crypto exchange over the past month. (Source: CoinGecko)South Korea’s Bithumb Aiming for National IPO First
Bithumb wants to become the first crypto exchange to go public on the Korea Exchange.The firm has reportedly developed plans to spin off some of its operations into a separate company  to speed up the process.Lee became Bithumb CEO in May 2022 after serving as the head of the firm’s global operations.He helmed a previous attempt to launch an IPO in 2020. But this bid was eventually shelved due to concerns about the firm’s “opaque governance structure.”The 2020 attempt was also derailed by a prosecution service investigation into fraud charges leveled against the former Bithumb Holdings and Bithumb Korea board chairman Lee Jeong-hoon.Lee Joeng-hoon has since been acquitted. Bithumb resurrected its IPO plans in November last year.Compliance to Take Priority
The media outlet reported that Bithumb is still planning a spin-off. But Bithumb will likely need to delay this for a while as it first prioritizes its compliance with the Act on the Protection of Virtual Asset Users, which will take effect from July 19, 2024.The outlet wrote that “it seems unlikely that CEO Lee will be replaced” as the firm looks for “continuity in its IPO strategy.”Lee has also been credited with turning the exchange’s fortunes around during crypto winter by temporarily doing away with commission fees.The move briefly saw Bithumb’s trading volumes surpass those of the market-leading Upbit exchange.Trading volumes on South Korea’s Upbit crypto exchange over the past month. (Source: CoinGecko)The company has since fallen behind Upbit again after restoring commission fees. But Bithumb volumes have remained high in the period since.Insiders also believe that Lee retains the backing of Lee Jeong-hoon. The latter may soon make a “return to the Bithumb board of directors,” the media outlet noted.

Crypto Scheme Case: Australian Court Gives Win To Watchdog


								Recent reports revealed that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) was granted its first victory on a non-cash payment case involving cryptocurrencies. Per the documents, an Australian court ruled partially in favor of the watchdog’s lawsuit against BPS Financial Pty Ltd (BPS).

“Qoin Scheme” Earns $26 Million In Sales
In 2022, ASIC initiated civil penalty procedures against BPS for alleged “misleading, false or deceptive” advertising and engaging in unlicensed operations with a non-cash payment facility involving a crypto asset token.
The Australian regulator claimed that the Qoin Facility was a “non-cash payment facility” established by the company in 2020. The “Qoin scheme” included the Qoin tokens, the Qoin Wallet, and a distributed digital ledger implemented by blockchain technology.
Moreover, ASIC alleged that BPS promoted the tokens to retail consumers and business owners as a payment method for “goods and services offered by Qoin Merchants.”
Nonetheless, the tokens could only be traded on the BTX Exchange, operated by Block Trade Exchange Pty Ltd (BTX), a company under BPS. The crypto exchange seemingly only allowed trading Qoin tokens for Australian dollars, and over time, it allegedly imposed restrictions that limited the ability to exchange the token.
According to the press release, the Qoin Wallet had over 93,000 users by September 2022. Additionally, it received over AU$40 million, around $26.5 million, from Qoin token sales.
Court Rules In Favor Of Watchdog
On May 3, 2024, the Australian Federal Court found that BPS was guilty of most of the charges leveled by ASIC. Judge J Downes ruled that the company “engaged in unlicensed conduct when offering the ‘Qoin Wallet,’ a non-cash payment facility which used a crypto-asset token.”
Judge Downes considered that BPS broke the Corporations Act for at least 10 months in 2020 as it did not hold an Australian Financial Services License. As a result, the company was not authorized to “issue or provide advice about the Qoin Wallet.”
Moreover, the judge found that the company engaged in misleading marketing and representation of the product. The reasons for this ruling include BPS’s false claims that the Qoin Wallet was officially registered and that said wallet could be used to purchase goods and services from an “increasing number of Qoin Merchants” when it was declining.

Additionally, the Court found that the only crypto exchange that accepted Qoin before November 2021 was the BTX exchange. This contradicted the claims that Qoin tokens could be traded for other crypto assets or AUD from different exchanges.
Clearer Regulatory Framework For Crypto?
ASIC Chair Joe Longo deems this “a significant ruling as the first court outcome against a non-cash payment facility involving crypto.”  However, the Court did not agree with all of ASIC’s arguments against BPS.
According to the official document, Judge Downes disagreed with the regulator’s claim that the Qoin Wallet and the Qoin Blockchain were one single scheme as part of the Qoin Facility:

Contrary to ASIC’s submissions, the Qoin Blockchain, a means of acquiring Qoin and a means whereby business operators who hold Qoin Wallets can register as Qoin Merchants are not components of, and are not themselves, the mechanism which allows the user to make the non-cash payment.

The Court’s rejection becomes a crucial ruling against the regulator’s attempt to classify blockchain technology as a financial product under Australian law. According to ASIC’s Chair, the agency has taken several enforcement actions against crypto asset businesses “with the intention of clarifying what is a regulated product and when the provider needs a license.”
Lastly, Longo added that the enforcements are meant as a message to the crypto community:

These proceedings should send a message to the crypto industry that their products will continue to be scrutinized by ASIC to ensure consumers are protected and that they comply with regulatory obligations.

The Digital Chamber slams SEC for issuing Wells Notice against Robinhood

The Digital Chamber, a crypto trade association, condemned the SEC for submitting a Wells notice to Robinhood Crypto.In a statement on May 6, the association expressed “profound disappointment and concern” over the action and called it an example of regulatory overreach.The Digital Chamber emphasized its ongoing opposition to the SEC extending its reach without authorization from Congress. It noted that Congress is “actively deliberating legislation” to define regulatory jurisdiction over crypto and said the SEC has violated the process.To address jurisdictional issues, the Digital Chamber urged for “immediate legislative action” and said SEC Chair Gary Gensler should be compelled to testify before Congress.Support for companies and investorsThe Digital Chamber defended Robinhood, acknowledging the firm’s self-proclaimed good-faith compliance efforts and attempts to register with the SEC.The association said:“The Digital Chamber stands ready to support Robinhood Crypto and other affected companies… “It did not explicitly describe plans to submit an amicus brief in defense of Robinhood but said it had done so in other cases in the past, highlighting its submission in Kraken’s case in February.The Digital Chamber further asserted the SEC’s actions are at odds with the regulator’s investor protection mandate, noting that aggressive enforcement harms new companies and reduces investors’ ability to make autonomous financial decisions.Robinhood Crypto received Wells noticeRobinhood disclosed in a May 4 SEC filing that its subsidiary, Robinhood Crypto, received a Wells notice. It commented further on the development in a May 6 post.The Wells notice indicates the SEC intends to recommend enforcement action against Robinhood. However, the SEC has not yet filed a lawsuit.Robinhood nevertheless described how it might oppose the SEC’s intentions. The company said it intends to engage with the SEC to show the weakness of any case in terms of the facts and the law. It also asserted the assets it lists are not securities.Robinhood said it will continue to offer its crypto-related services.Mentioned in this articlePosted In: US, Regulation

Coinbase and Brian Armstrong hit with new lawsuit over illegal securities | Cryptopolitan

Coinbase, a major player in the cryptocurrency exchange market, and its CEO, Brian Armstrong, are now facing a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that Coinbase, contrary to its denials, has been engaging in the sale of securities without the necessary registrations, thus breaching various state securities laws.For over a decade, Coinbase has positioned itself at the edge of legality within the murky waters of the cryptocurrency industry. The foundation of its operations is now under scrutiny, accused of being a mix of deceit and hope.Essentially, the company operated on the notion that while it might eventually be caught for selling unregistered securities, it would simply deal with the consequences later rather than proactively seeking the necessary permissions.Regulatory Missteps and AllegationsAccording to legal documents, Coinbase has openly admitted in its user agreements that it functions as a “Securities Broker.” It explicitly states that the crypto assets it deals in, including SOL, MATIC, NEAR, MANA, ALGO, UNI, XTZ, and XLM, are classified as “financial assets.” This classification aligns these assets with investment contracts or other forms of securities as defined under California Commercial Code Section 8102.Despite such admissions, Coinbase did not register itself, its employees, or the digital asset securities it marketed. This omission came into sharper focus when Coinbase registered as a public entity with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In doing so, it acknowledged its dealings in securities but failed to comply with the registration requirements for the same.The consequences of these actions are now being felt as plaintiffs in the lawsuit, consisting of several California residents like Gerardo Aceves from Yuba City and Thomas Fan from San Ramon, and others from across the nation, seek statutory damages. They allege investment losses due to Coinbase’s actions, underscoring the broader implications of Coinbase’s alleged regulatory non-compliance.Details of the Class and Implications for CoinbaseThe lawsuit pulls together a diverse class of plaintiffs from various parts of the United States, each of whom engaged with Coinbase’s digital investment platforms and purportedly suffered financial harm as a result of the company’s alleged disregard for securities laws.Defendants in the case include not only Coinbase Global, Inc. and its subsidiary Coinbase, Inc., but also Coinbase Asset Management, LLC, and CEO Brian Armstrong. These entities and individuals are accused of systematically failing to register the sale of digital asset securities and those selling them, an oversight that contravenes federal and state securities laws.Coinbase’s early recognition of the potential securities classification of digital assets and its strategic decisions thereafter form a major part of the allegations. Documents suggest that Coinbase had developed a Securities Law Framework to evaluate and manage the risks associated with the sale of digital tokens under U.S. federal securities laws.However, this framework was apparently not sufficient or was disregarded when it came to compliance with legal standards, as the digital assets continued to be offered without the necessary registrations.California’s Role and JurisdictionThe lawsuit highlights California’s substantial role in the matter, noting that the state’s laws are applicable to the case due to Coinbase’s large presence and business operations within the state. This ties back to California’s vested interest in regulating companies that engage in business within its borders, particularly when such activities may impact its residents and the integrity of its market.With the headquarters of Coinbase in California, and massive business transactions occurring there, the application of California law is deemed appropriate and constitutionally sound. This legal stance is expected to influence the proceedings significantly as the case unfolds, emphasizing the state’s capacity to enforce its securities laws against entities operating within its jurisdiction.

                        A May 6 transfer of $8.3 million associated with the now-bankrupt FTX exchange and its sister trading firm, Alameda Research, has raised questions about the future of creditors awaiting compensation.The transfer occurred just a day before FTX debtors were scheduled to release an amended restructuring plan for the exchange, adding a layer of intrigue to an already complex situation.FTX and Almada Research: A Friend In CrimeAccording to PeckShield alerts, two wallets linked to FTX and Alameda Research conducted the transfers. The FTX-associated wallet moved 860 Tether Gold (XAUT) tokens, valued at over $2 million, to algorithmic trading firm Wintermute. Meanwhile, an Alameda-related wallet transferred 2,027 Ether, worth more than $6.3 million, to two undisclosed addresses. While the exact motive behind these transactions is unclear, they coincide with a critical juncture in FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings.The impending deadline for FTX debtors to submit an amended version of the “Plan and Disclosure Statement” on May 7 has left creditors eagerly anticipating insights into how they will be compensated for their losses. The amended restructuring plan promises to offer creditors more clarity regarding their path to recovery. Concerns loom large among some creditors who fear that the revised plan may not adequately address their interests, however.One such voice of caution is Sunil, an FTX Customer Ad-Hoc Committee member representing over 1,500 FTX creditors. Sunil has urged users to scrutinize the upcoming plan, warning that it may favor debtors at the expense of creditors. “S&C [Sullivan & Cromwell] likely include clauses to absolve their liability for crimes,” said Sunil in a May 5 X post. “S&C puppet John Ray secures a position for himself. Property rights not recognized [for creditors].”FTX Bankruptcy: A Catastrophe To The Crypto Market
Sunil highlighted potential issues, such as clauses to absolve liability for crimes and the lack of recognition of creditors’ property rights. Ongoing legal battles, including lawsuits against bankruptcy firm Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C), add to the complexity. “S&C knew of FTX US and FTX Trading Ltd.’s omissions, untruthful and fraudulent conduct, and misappropriation of Class Members’ funds,” claimed FTX creditors in a February 16 court filing. “Despite this knowledge, S&C stood to gain financially from the FTX Group’s misconduct and agreed, at least impliedly, to assist that unlawful conduct for its own gain.”These legal disputes further prolong the resolution process, potentially delaying creditors’ access to compensation. With over $490 million worth of claims already sold through 507 transactions, the path to resolution appears fraught with challenges.FTX, amidst bankruptcy proceedings, recently agreed to sell the majority of its shares in AI startup Anthropic for $884 million. The deal awaits final approval from Judge John Dorsey, who oversees FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings. If approved, it would represent nearly two-thirds of FTX’s total shares in Anthropic.

How New MetaMask Feature Stops Transaction Inefficiency Losses - DailyCoin


        
MetaMask has launched a new feature, Smart Transactions.



Smart Transactions promises to help users avoid transaction inefficiency losses.



The new feature leverages a virtual mempool to offer users greater privacy, reliability, and transaction control.
MetaMask is back at it again.Over the past few months, the popular Ethereum wallet has rolled out feature after feature to improve the experience of its users. Most recently, at the beginning of April 2024, it launched a Daylight API integration to make it easier for users to track the airdrops they are eligible for. Now, MetaMask is rolling out a new feature to help users save significant costs and avoid exploitation on the Ethereum network.On Monday, May 6, MetaMask unveiled a new feature called Smart Transactions, described as “a reimagined transaction experience” designed to help users avoid losses due to transaction inefficiencies. These inefficiencies include failed transactions and MEV extraction strategies.MEV refers to extra profit that network participants can obtain from users by re-ordering transactions before they are processed. One of the popular MEV strategies is frontrunning user transactions. 
Bad actors front-run user transactions by leveraging the transparency of the mempool (a waiting room for transactions on the blockchain). These malicious actors, typically bots, use the mempool to identify high-value transactions; after identifying these transactions, these bots execute a similar transaction before the original is processed. After successfully executing their transaction, the bot quickly sells to the original user at a higher price, compelling them to pay more than initially expected.According to MetaMask, failed transactions and MEV frontrunning strategies cost Ethereum users $440 million annually. Stressing the severity of the problems in the status quo, Executive Director of Product at MetaMask Gal Eldar suggested that they created a “frustrating and unpredictable” user experience.
"Submitting transactions to a distributed network is hard. This complexity often results in a user experience that is both frustrating and unpredictable. In many cases, it can lead to significant financial leakage due to frontrunning attacks, costly on-chain reverts, and overpayments for block space. It's a reality many users, whether knowingly or not, have faced and reluctantly come to accept. Over time, it became increasingly clear that we could do better and tackle these problems head-on."So, how does Smart Transactions tackle these problems?Virtual MempoolSmart Transactions utilizes a virtual mempool where users’ transactions can remain private until published on the Ethereum mainnet. With these transactions held in private, they can not be front-run by MEV bots. Beyond privacy, the virtual pool offers Smart Transactions up to 99.5% success rates and lower fees through “a 30 millisecond Just-In-Time simulation service.” At the same time, the new feature comes with a built-in dashboard that allows users to monitor their transactions directly within MetaMask without visiting a third-party blockchain explorer website.MetaMask has promised to release updates to the Smart Transactions feature in the coming months to optimize results.On the Flipside 
The MetaMask Smart Transactions feature is opt-in, meaning users can decide whether to use it and switch it off whenever they want.



The Smart Transactions feature relies on third parties.
Why This MattersAs highlighted by MetaMask, blockchain inefficiencies pose cost and user experience hurdles to users. Tackling these issues through features like Smart Transactions will likely be critical to crypto adoption.Read this for more on MetaMask:How MetaMask Now Allows Users to Check Airdrop EligibilitySee how Ethereum supply growth is changing with low fees:Ethereum Turns Inflationary as Fees Remain at Record Lows

Ethereum Burn Rate Hits Yearly Low: What This Means For ETH's Future


                            In recent weeks, Ethereum has displayed subtle signs of recovery amidst a generally bearish crypto market, with the altcoin mimicking Bitcoin’s modest uptrend.
Despite Ethereum’s price increasing slightly by 0.2% over the last 24 hours, a parallel trend that might significantly affect Ethereum’s economic model has been unfolding beneath the surface.

Decline In Network Activity Reduces ETH Burn
April witnessed Ethereum’s ETH burn rate hitting an annual low, primarily due to a significant decrease in network transaction fees.
These fees have typically fluctuated just below 10 gwei this year, but recent weeks have seen them dip to some of the lowest levels, directly influencing the rate at which ETH is burned.

This reduced burn rate is evidenced by the stark drop in daily burned ETH, which reached a low of 671 ETH in the past day a notable decrease from the daily figures of 2,500–3,000 ETH seen earlier in the year.

Such a decline in burn rate is not merely a statistical anomaly but a reflection of broader shifts within the Ethereum network.
A significant factor contributing to the lowered gas fees is the increased migration of network activities to Layer 2 solutions, which enhance transaction speeds while lowering costs.
Moreover, innovations like blob transactions, introduced in Ethereum’s recent Dencun upgrade, have further optimized costs on these secondary layers.
Notably, Blobs are a feature introduced to enhance Ethereum’s compatibility with Layer 2 solutions like zkSync, Optimism, and Arbitrum by efficiently managing data storage needs. This functionality is part of the Dencun upgrade, which integrates proto-danksharding via EIP-4844.
While beneficial in reducing transaction fees, these technological strides pose challenges to Ethereum’s deflationary mechanisms.
This upgrade introduced a new fee structure in which a part of every transaction fee, the base fee, is burned, potentially reducing the overall ETH supply. However, with decreased transaction fees, the anticipated deflationary pressure via burning has softened, signaling a shift to a more inflationary trend in the short term.
According to Ultrasoundmoney, Ethereum’s supply dynamics have swung to a mildly inflationary mode with a growth rate of 0.498%. This shift could realign if network activity intensifies, leading to increased transaction fees and, consequently, higher burn rates.

Ethereum Market Response
Despite these underlying network dynamics, Ethereum’s market price has struggled to regain its former highs above $3,500. The asset trades around $3,085, reflecting a slight downturn over recent weeks.

This price behavior underscores the broader market’s reaction to internal network changes and external economic factors, such as regulatory struggles from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and macroeconomic uncertainties.

Looking ahead, the trajectory of Ethereum’s gas fees and subsequent ETH burn rate will be crucial in determining the sustainability of its economic model.

Cardano Founder Considers Partnership With Bitcoin Cash - What Is It About? | Bitcoinist.com


								Cardano’s (ADA) founder, Charles Hoskinson, recently raised the possibility of Cardano partnering with Bitcoin Cash. He noted how significant this partnership could be for Bitcoin Cash as it would put it ahead of networks like Bitcoin. 
What Cardano’s Potential Partnership With Bitcoin Cash Is About
Hoskinson conducted a “hypothetical poll” on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, asking his followers if they would like to see Bitcoin Cash become a Cardano “partnerchain.” He noted that this partnership would upgrade Bitcoin Cash with “Useful Proof of Work Leios, NiPoPoWs, and Ergo tech.”

Hoskinson further claimed that the partnership would make Bitcoin Cash the “fastest and most useful proof of work chain (PoW) ever built.” At the time of writing, over 13,000 people have voted on the poll, with 67.7% voting in favor of the partnership. Ben Scherrey, founder and CTO of blockchain firm Biggest Lab, also supports the move, noting how both chains share similarities. 
He stated in an X post that he “always thought there was some natural synergy between the two chains given the shared UTXO model that allows for high scalability and decentralization.” Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Bitcoin Cash is already known to have an edge over Bitcoin as it is faster, cheaper, and more scalable. 
Therefore, Hoskinson’s claim that Bitcoin Cash will become the fastest and most useful PoW may be valid. Upgrading Bitcoin Cash with PoW Leios and Ergo tech means the network can process transactions faster and have a more efficient smart contract functionality. However, the concept of making Bitcoin Cash a Cardano “partnerchain” is still unclear, considering that they operate different consensus mechanisms. 
Cardano Also Set To Undergo Two Major Upgrade
Cardano is also set to experience two significant upgrades. One is the Chang hard fork, which the network plans to carry out this quarter. This will promote decentralized governance on the blockchain as Cardano shifts to a community-driven governance model. Given the criticism that Hoskinson has prevented the network from progressing, this could change the outlook of the network. 

Specifically, Tom Dunleavy, Partner and Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at MV Capital, once called Hoskinson a “megalomaniac” who is “unwilling to change or adapt to the ecosystem.” Therefore, with the community having more control, there could be changes in the network that could help it adapt to the ecosystem. 
The second upgrade is the introduction of the Ouroboros Leios protocol, which will also take place this year. This upgrade is expected to enhance Cardano’s scalability and efficiency. Hoskinson noted that this development is a big step towards solving the blockchain trilemma of security, scalability, and decentralization.

Whale Alert: Ethereum (ETH) Investor Books Millions in Profits After Year-Long Hold | Cryptoglobe


                                
A major Ethereum investor, often referred to in the cryptocurrency world as a “whale,” appears to be cashing in on a successful year, according to data analysis from blockchain intelligence service Lookonchain.



The investor, reportedly purchased a significant amount of Ether a year ago, at a price point of around $1,890 per token and has, over this past week, they initiated a series of transactions that suggest profit-taking.



The whale first withdrew 12,906 ETH, valued at roughly $24.39 million at the time, from the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The tokens were then deposited into Lido, a platform that allows users to earn interest on their holdings through liquid staking – meaning users can earn interest by staking their ETH, while receiving a liquid token representing the staked assets that can be usd elsewhere.



This move could indicate the investor’s intention to hold the asset for the long term while earning passive income. However, their actions suggest a shift in strategy as on April 30, coinciding with a market dip, the whale withdrew 7,000 ETH from Lido and redeposited the funds back onto Binance.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

This swift transfer, suggests the investor aimed to capitalize on a potential short-term price swing.







The total profit on the 7,000 ETH sold likely exceeds $16 million, highlighting the significant gains made by the whale since their initial purchase, according to the blockchain analysis service.



The price of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization saw a significant swing over the past week, dropping from around $3,250 to a low just above $2,850 before it started to recover to its initial starting point. The cryptocurrency has since started plunging, with ETH now trading below $3,100 again.



Year-to-date, the cryptocurrency is up more than 35% as it gained from a wider cryptocurrency market recovery that saw the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin rise by more than 50% over the same period.

Apple's AI Ambitions Emerge Ahead of iPad Event - Decrypt

The next Apple event is upon us—kicking off at 10 a.m. ET on Tuesday—and while the focus is typically on the latest and greatest hardware, investors and consumers alike are meanwhile hoping to learn more about whether and how the tech titan plans to take a bold step into harnessing artificial intelligence.The secretive, Cupertino-based company has telegraphed nothing, although late leaks have confirmed what the event logo telegraphed when it was first unveiled last month: new iPads are coming, according to famed Apple reporter Mark Gurman. While there will undoubtedly be new features and apps announced to take advantage of the upgraded specs, industry watchers will likely have to wait until next month for solid AI news.June will bring the annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), where AI is expected to be integrated across the Apple ecosystem.Most tantalizingly, Gurman suggests that Apple plans to replace or enhance Siri with a generative AI model through a partnership with OpenAI or Google. Following similar moves by Microsoft, Apple is also reportedly planning to add AI-powered summarization and autocomplete features to its Pages, Numbers, and Keynote applications.According to Bloomberg, Apple's software development Xcode tool will likely get AI features to keep up with Microsoft Copilot and Github Copilot. Generative AI chatbots will help handle AppleCare services. Even Apple Music is expected to get an AI upgrade, allowing the platform to create personalized Spotify-like playlists.Meanwhile, Apple Insider claims the native iPhone web browser Safari will also get an AI upgrade, including an advanced content blocking tool called Web Eraser. The Apple-centric media outlet also says the company is working on an AI-powered visual search feature.Apple's latest quarterly earnings call, held last week, included talk of AI, with Apple CEO Tim Cook saying it has saved lives via the Apple Watch.“We're harnessing AI and machine-learning to power lifesaving features like a regular rhythm notifications and fall detection,” he said. “We see Generative AI as a very key opportunity across our products, and we believe that we have advantages that set us apart there.”He went as far as saying the company's current MacBook Air laptop is “the best consumer laptop for AI.”When pressed to explain whether AI would become a major factor in consumer purchasing decisions, when software upgrades don't usually generate the same buzz that new hardware does, Cook demurred.“I don't want to get in front of our announcements, obviously,” he said. “We'll be talking more about it as we go through the weeks ahead.”While Apple has not been as visible in the global AI arms race as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, the company says it has been working with the emerging technology for years."We've been doing research across a wide range of AI technologies, including generative AI, for years,” Cook told Reuters in August. “We're going to continue investing and innovating and responsibly advancing our products with these technologies to help enrich people's lives.”In November, speaking to singer Dua Lipa on the At Your Service podcast, Apple CEO Tim Cook emphasized that AI needs to be developed with safety in mind.“What is needed with this new form of AI, generative AI, is some rules of the road and some regulation around this,” Cook said. “I think many governments around the world are now focused on this and focused on how to do it, and we're trying to help with that. And we're one of the first ones that say this is needed, that some regulation is as needed.”In December, Apple launched MLX, an open-source framework for machine learning on its M-series CPUs, entering a field traditionally dominated by Linux and Microsoft.In February, Apple teamed with the University of California Santa Barbara to develop its Multimodal Large-Language Model-Guided Image Editing (MGIE) software, an AI model that can edit images based on natural language.And just last month, in a bid to challenge Microsoft’s Phi-3, Apple released a series of small AI language models, known as OpenELM, in 270 million, 450 million, 1.1 billion, and 3 billion parameter versions.Apple’s push into AI has not gone unnoticed by regulators like U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, calling the anti-trust lawsuit against Google critical, highlighting potential deals with Apple.“Google controls 90% of the search engine market, paying billions to Apple to be the default web browser,” Warren wrote on Twitter. “What's next? Google's in talks to embed its AI tools in iPhones.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

US Congressman calls SEC Chair Gary Gensler ârogue regulatorâ - Crypto Briefing




John Rose, US Representative serving Tennessee’s Sixth Congressional District, is strongly critical of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) action against Robinhood. The Congressman called the SEC and its Chair, Gary Gensler “rogue regulators” in a recent post on X.According to him, the federal agency went beyond its intended role of protecting investors and maintaining fair markets. He believes that instead of stifling innovation, the SEC should prioritize investor protection.
“The [SEC] exceeded its mandate to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly markets by issuing a Wells Notice to [Robinhood App], a precursor to enforcement action,” the Congressman criticized.
“I’m proud to help lead the effort to provide clarity by passing the FIT for the 21st Century Act so that rogue regulators like [Gary Gensler] can focus on their mandate to protect investors and not disrupt innovation,” he added.
The SEC is under fire after threatening enforcement action against Robinhood’s crypto arm. Rose is among a number of high-profile figures to have voiced strong opposition to the agency’s move.Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at Variant, also took to X to express his perspective.The SEC has issued an unusually high number of Wells Notices related to crypto in recent months. However, Chervinsky believes the SEC is misusing the Wells Notice process by using it as “a scare tactic” to pressure companies.
“The number they’ve sent about crypto in recent months is astonishing. It’s hard to imagine that they would (or could) bring so many enforcement actions at once,” Chervinsky stated. “It seems like they’re abusing the Wells process as a scare tactic now.”
“If the SEC brings as many enforcement actions as it has sent Wells notices, it will be in flagrant violation of both the law and its Congressional mandate. If not, it’s clearly abusing the Wells process to get free discovery and terrorize upstanding US companies,” he added.
Chervinsky argued that the SEC is focusing too heavily on crypto regulation, neglecting its core responsibility of regulating traditional equity and debt markets. He noted that this focus is a waste of taxpayer resources that could be better spent on the agency’s core duties.
“The SEC allocates a grossly disproportionate amount of its resources to crypto, given that its actual purpose is to regulate equity and debt markets. Every minute and taxpayer dollar spent on crypto is one not spent on the real mission that Congress created the SEC to pursue,” Chervinsky stated.
Under the leadership of Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has been actively pursuing legal actions against a range of prominent individuals and organizations within the industry.Following lawsuits against three leading crypto exchanges—Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance—the SEC continues to expand its targets to include new crypto-related entities such as Consensys, Uniswap Labs, and Robinhood.Ripple Labs, a previous major target of the SEC, has been one of the few entities to achieve a partial victory against the agency.

Solana NFTs revive, beat Polygon: What about Ethereum NFTs? - AMBCrypto



In the last 24 hours, SOL’s NFT sales exceeded $3 million 
Ethereum continued to dominate Solana and Polygon in the NFT ecosystem

Solana [SOL] witnessed some traction in its NFT ecosystem last week as a few popular collections migrated back to SOL. 
Does this mean that Solana’s NFT ecosystem is poised to witness further growth in the coming weeks? 
Solana outperforms Polygon
The NFT ecosystem boomed last week as sales across multiple chains increased. AMBCrypto’s look at NonFungible’s data revealed that the total number of NFT sales last week increased. 
The total number of unique sellers also went up during the same time.
NonFungible
While the market grew, Solana onboarded popular NFT collections like y00ts and DeGod, which had migrated to other chains earlier. 
To be precise, y00ts returned from Polygon [MATIC], while DeDod left Ethereum [ETH]. The inclusion of such top collections helped SOL’s NFT space. 
As per a tweet from SolanaFloor, SOL’s NFT sales reached $25 million in the last seven days. The number was commendable, as Polygon’s weekly NFT sales stood at a mere $8 million. 
Nonetheless, Ethereum remained the top player, as its weekly sales volume was $48 million, as per Cryptoslam. 
AMBCrypto’s look at DappRadar’s data revealed the top-performing collections on Solana. Both y00ts and DeGods made it to the top 5, along with Mad Lads, Frogana, and SMB Gen 2.

Is Solana still ahead of Polygon?
To see whether Solana continued to dominate Polygon, AMBCrypto checked their last 24 hours’ performances. As per our analysis, Solana continued to outperform Polygon. 
While Polygon’s 24-hour sales volume stood at just over $1 million, SOL’s number touched $3 million. 
Source: CRYPTOSLAM
However, it was interesting to note that despite high sales volume, SOL’s total transactions dipped by more than 10% while Polygon increased by 17%.
 Nonetheless, they were both still considerably behind Ethereum. The king of altcoins’ 24-hour sales volume exceeded $6 million, which was a 17% increase from the previous day.
Ethereum’s total number of buyers, sellers, and transactions all increased by 9.8%, 8.9%, and 12%, respectively, in the past 24 hours.

Realistic or not, here’s SOL’s market cap in ETH terms    

SOL turned bullish
While the blockchain’s NFT space flourished, its native token’s price action also turned bullish. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL’s price increased by more than 14% in the last seven days. 
In fact, in the last 24 hours alone, it surged by 6%. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $155.92 with a market capitalization of over $69.7 billion, making it the fifth-largest crypto.

Bitcoin To Reach Escape Velocity? Analyst Makes The Case


                            An analyst has explained how Bitcoin seems to be showing a good setup to reach escape velocity based on the trend in this indicator.
Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator Has Been Showing A Bullish Divergence
As explained by analyst Willy Woo in a new post on X, a bullish divergence has appeared to be forming in the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) oscillator of the cryptocurrency.
The VWAP is an indicator that calculates an average price for any given asset, taking into account not only the price but also the volume. More formally, it’s calculated as the cumulative price sum multiplied by the volume divided by the cumulative volume.

This metric puts a higher weight on the price at which more volume is traded. Usually, the exchange-reported volume is used to find the metric, but for a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, the entire transaction history is visible to the public thanks to blockchain data. Woo has used on-chain volume instead to calculate the VWAP for BTC.
The VWAP oscillator, the actual indicator of interest here, is a ratio between the asset’s spot price and VWAP. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in this metric over the past couple of years:

The value of the metric seems to have been on the decline in recent days | Source: @woonomic on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin VWAP oscillator has been in the negative territory for the past month but has recently shown a turnaround.
Although the metric is heading up, it’s still very much contained inside the red zone. At the same time as this rise, the cryptocurrency’s price has been heading down instead.
According to Woo, this is a bullish divergence forming for the asset and it’s also one that has a “lot of room to run,” since tops in the coin have generally occurred when the oscillator has reached a point of reversal at relatively high levels inside the positive zone, which should still be quite far away.
“Seems like a good setup for BTC to reach escape velocity,” notes the analyst. It remains to be seen whether the bullish divergence will end up bearing fruits for the asset.
In some other news, the Bitcoin whales (investors carrying 1,000 BTC or more) participated in buying around the recent lows of the asset. Still, market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has revealed that the accumulation sprees from these large investors have been displaying an overall downtrend.

From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin whales have been buying at each of the dips in the last few months, but it’s also visible that the scale of this buying has been diminishing with each one.

This could be a sign that the appetite for buying among these investors, although still present, is getting smaller with each dip.
BTC Price
When writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,500, up over 1% in the last seven days.

This State-Owned German Bank Enters Crypto With New Blockchain-Based Digital Bond | Bitcoinist.com


								German state-owned development bank Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) is gearing up to issue its first blockchain-based digital bond, marking a significant milestone in adopting crypto technology within the financial sector. 
According to a recent report by Bloomberg, KfW has already successfully issued a digital bond as a central register security in compliance with the German Electronic Securities Act (eWpG). The bank is preparing to take the next step by offering a blockchain-based bond to attract a wide range of investors.
Streamlined Crypto Bond Offering
Treasurer Tim Armbruster expressed optimism about digitalization’s advantages in terms of increased efficiency and scalability. Recognizing these potential benefits, KfW aims to leverage blockchain technology to streamline and increase its bond issuance process.

KfW plans to hold discussions during a several-week preparatory phase to familiarize European institutional investors with the upcoming transaction. 
This will reportedly allow investors ample time to understand and evaluate the opportunities the blockchain-based bond presents. Union Investment, an experienced investor in crypto assets, has been announced as an anchor investor in this deal.
Per the report, while the bond issuance will be in digital format, KfW will continue to process payments using traditional payment systems. The transaction is expected to be finalized in the summer of this year.
Anonymous Source Reveals Anticipated €100M Bond
Several prominent financial institutions have been enlisted to facilitate the bond issuance. DZ Bank, Deutsche Bank, LBBW, and Bankhaus Metzler will act as joint bookrunners and oversee the process. Frankfurt-based fintech firm Cashlink Technologies GmbH will be the crypto assets’ registrar.
Although specific details about the bond remain undisclosed, an anonymous source familiar with the matter revealed that the minimum size is anticipated to be €100 million ($108 million). The bond is expected to mature in December 2025, providing investors with a defined timeline for their investment.
KfW’s move follows in the footsteps of JPMorgan, which recently ventured into the crypto market by employing blockchain technology to offer municipal bonds to investors. This move reflects the increasing recognition of blockchain’s potential to revolutionize traditional financial operations.

KfW’s pioneering issue of a blockchain-based digital bond sets a precedent for other financial institutions to explore similar avenues. 
The successful implementation of this technology could lead to increased efficiency and accessibility in the bond market, ultimately transforming the way crypto assets are issued and traded among traditional finance institutions.

Bitcoin ETFs A Social Dud For Lay Folks? Analytics Platform Shares Data That Shows 'If Retail Is Here, They're Incredibly Silent' - Benzinga

Spot exchange-traded funds might have excited institutional investors of Bitcoin BTC/USD, but the frenzy is yet to catch up on retail.What happened: The King Coin's social activity dipped significantly since peaking on the ETF approval day in early January, according to LunarCrush.Social activity is a widely used metric in crypto circles to gauge the sentiment among retail investors, a proxy for private individuals with small holdings.The data shows that socially-driven engagements like views, likes, comments, and retweets declined in the last four months. Posts by cryptocurrency content creators also failed to generate traction.All this happened while the price of the world's largest digital asset was pumping, hitting a new all-time high past $73,000 in March. Google Trends data narrated a similar story, with search interest halving from its peak in early March. Why it matters: Bitcoin has generated considerable media coverage since investment vehicles tracking its spot price started trading in the U.S. market. Days of net positive flows in ETFs have invariably applied upward price pressure.  However, the last month proved rough for the general cryptocurrency market, and Bitcoin in particular. The King Coin plummeted more than 15% in April, one of the worst declines in recent history.The corrective phase might have prompted retail to take a cautionary approach, restricting their investments in the space.Price action: Bitcoin was trading at $63,695 at the time of writing, following a 1.13% dip in the last 24 hours, according to the data from Benzinga Pro. Trading volumes almost hit $30 billion in the 24-hour period, marking a 64% jump.Photo by ShutterstockRead Next: Bitcoin Mining Stocks Are Moving Higher Monday: What’s Going On?

Bitcoin Supply Shock: Exchange Inflows Lowest Since 2015


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange inflow trend has been at its lowest in almost a decade recently, a sign that may be bullish for the asset.
Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Have Been On The Decline Recently
As pointed out by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the BTC exchange inflows have been heading down for a while now. The “exchange inflow” is an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin the investors deposit to wallets attached to centralized exchanges.

When this metric’s value is high, it means that holders are transferring a large number of coins to these platforms right now. As one of the main reasons why investors might deposit coins in the exchanges’ custody is for selling purposes, this kind of trend can be bearish for the asset.
On the other hand, the low indicator implies the exchanges aren’t receiving many deposits currently. Depending on the trend in the opposite metric, the exchange outflow, such a trend can be either bullish or neutral for the cryptocurrency’s price.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange inflow over the past decade:

As displayed in the above graph, the trend of the Bitcoin exchange Inflow is sitting at 20,000 BTC right now, the lowest value the market has seen since 2015.
The analyst has also attached the data for the indicator’s 365-day moving average (MA) to the same chart. This line has been on the decline since February 2018, dropping from 90,000 BTC to 36,000 BTC today.
The decline in the exchange inflows could indicate that the appetite for selling the cryptocurrency has reduced. If so, due to how supply-demand dynamics work, the price could naturally benefit from a bullish effect from this pattern.
However, there could be another explanation for this long-term trend, and it’s the fact that the exchanges haven’t played a constant role in the market throughout these years.
In the 2017 cycle, the exchanges were relevant in the market, so they actively received huge deposits. Still, during the 2021 cycle, new ways to invest in Bitcoin popped up, which may explain why the drop-off occurred between the two periods.

Today, Bitcoin finds itself in an era when spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have gained approval and are attracting considerable demand.
With these ETFs, cryptocurrency exchanges are bound to have lost more relevance, hence why it looks like this cycle will see even fewer deposits than the 2021 epoch.
BTC Price
Bitcoin had recovered beyond $65,000 earlier during the past day, but the asset seems to have slipped, as it’s now back down to $63,100.

US Congressman calls SEC Chair Gary Gensler ârogue regulatorâ - Crypto Briefing




John Rose, US Representative serving Tennessee’s Sixth Congressional District, is strongly critical of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) action against Robinhood. The Congressman called the SEC and its Chair, Gary Gensler “rogue regulators” in a recent post on X.According to him, the federal agency went beyond its intended role of protecting investors and maintaining fair markets. He believes that instead of stifling innovation, the SEC should prioritize investor protection.
“The [SEC] exceeded its mandate to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly markets by issuing a Wells Notice to [Robinhood App], a precursor to enforcement action,” the Congressman criticized.
“I’m proud to help lead the effort to provide clarity by passing the FIT for the 21st Century Act so that rogue regulators like [Gary Gensler] can focus on their mandate to protect investors and not disrupt innovation,” he added.
The SEC is under fire after threatening enforcement action against Robinhood’s crypto arm. Rose is among a number of high-profile figures to have voiced strong opposition to the agency’s move.Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at Variant, also took to X to express his perspective.The SEC has issued an unusually high number of Wells Notices related to crypto in recent months. However, Chervinsky believes the SEC is misusing the Wells Notice process by using it as “a scare tactic” to pressure companies.
“The number they’ve sent about crypto in recent months is astonishing. It’s hard to imagine that they would (or could) bring so many enforcement actions at once,” Chervinsky stated. “It seems like they’re abusing the Wells process as a scare tactic now.”
“If the SEC brings as many enforcement actions as it has sent Wells notices, it will be in flagrant violation of both the law and its Congressional mandate. If not, it’s clearly abusing the Wells process to get free discovery and terrorize upstanding US companies,” he added.
Chervinsky argued that the SEC is focusing too heavily on crypto regulation, neglecting its core responsibility of regulating traditional equity and debt markets. He noted that this focus is a waste of taxpayer resources that could be better spent on the agency’s core duties.
“The SEC allocates a grossly disproportionate amount of its resources to crypto, given that its actual purpose is to regulate equity and debt markets. Every minute and taxpayer dollar spent on crypto is one not spent on the real mission that Congress created the SEC to pursue,” Chervinsky stated.
Under the leadership of Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has been actively pursuing legal actions against a range of prominent individuals and organizations within the industry.Following lawsuits against three leading crypto exchanges—Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance—the SEC continues to expand its targets to include new crypto-related entities such as Consensys, Uniswap Labs, and Robinhood.Ripple Labs, a previous major target of the SEC, has been one of the few entities to achieve a partial victory against the agency.
