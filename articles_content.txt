X platform user calling himself DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) and one of the X team members has published a post, stating that “2024 will be the year of 𝕏 Payments.” This triggered an enthusiastic response from the crypto community based on this popular social media platform and average X users.Hope for DOGE payments on X arise from ashesThis announcement follows the news of X owner tech centibillionaire Elon Musk securing licenses for payment processing and money transmitter operations in three new US states. The authorities of Illinois, Oregon and New Mexico granted the necessary approvals to Musk’s company a week ago.As the list of these granted permissions grows bigger, hopes of Musk finally implementing cryptocurrency-powered payments on the X platform have been reignited. In particular, this is true about the iconic meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE), of which Musk is a loyal fan.Even before he purchased Twitter in 2022 and rebranded it as X a year later, he spoke during podcasts that DOGE seems like an ideal means of payments on the social media behemoth, as well as a way to reward content creators.DOGE price jumps 44% in anticipationSince March 20, when the aforementioned news about X securing new licenses spread around the crypto space, the Dogecoin price has shown a staggering increase by more than 44%.DOGE gradually surged from $0.1291 to the $0.1863 level where the popular meme coin is changing hands at the time of this writing.In the meantime, a recent report shows that Dogecoin open interest has reached an astounding $1.26 million. Even if Elon Musk has not been speaking openly about DOGE as of late, the analyst believes that the tech mogul and X developments remain the main drivers behind the DOGE price.In particular, it says, the massive rise of the open interest above $1.26 billion has been triggered by the obtaining of the above-mentioned new licenses for the X platform. A chart shared by the source shows that the rise in the open interest started on the day when the news came out – on March 20. If X starts utilizing Dogecoin for internal payments and for tipping, it will be a great expansion of DOGE adoption and will certainly have a tremendous impact on the meme coin’s price.

Finance Guru Reveals Why Bitcoin Is The ‘Perfect Asset At The Right Time’ | Bitcoinist.com


								Robert Kiyosaki, the best-selling author of the popular book, ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ has hailed Bitcoin as the perfect asset. Delving into the digital asset’s distinctive qualities, the financial expert offers a comprehensive comparison between BTC and traditional fiat currencies through a question-and-answer format. 
Bitcoin As The Perfect Asset
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Kiyosaki posed a series of questions about Bitcoin, accompanied by answers to each query. When he questioned his stance on BTC, the finance guru unequivocally declared himself a Bitcoin bull, affirming his admiration for the cryptocurrency. 

He characterized Bitcoin as the “perfect asset at the right time,” because of its high value and potential in today’s economic and financial landscape. 
According to the financial author, BTC could be a scam or a Ponzi Scheme. However, the same could be said about most of the traditional fiat currencies in the world such as the United States Dollar (USD), Euro, Yen and others. 
Kiyosaki has branded fiat currencies as “fake,” shedding light on the inconsistencies in the US government’s efforts to stimulate economic and financial growth. The finance expert criticized US political leaders, denouncing them as “incompetent or corrupt or both,” while outlining the economic challenges such as debt and inflation faced by the US. 
Despite his pessimistic assessment of fiat currencies, Kiyosaki has remained optimistic about Bitcoin. The financial guru has heralded Bitcoin as a strong network, highlighting that he was super bullish on the cryptocurrency because it applied Metcalf’s law, which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its user base. In other words, as more people use Bitcoin, its overall value increases. 
Kiyosaki’s Advice To The Crypto Community
In his post, Kiyosaki advises the broader crypto community against investing their funds in the US dollar, urging them instead to save in more valuable and tangible assets like silver, gold and Bitcoin. He emphasized that individuals who saved in “fake money” were at a disadvantage, highlighting the risks associated with investing in a currency vulnerable to inflationary pressures.

Further stressing his views on BTC, Kiyosaki acknowledged the possibility of the cryptocurrency’s future value diminishing to zero. However, he noted that fiat currencies could face a similar risk, highlighting the historical depreciation of thousands of fiat currencies to zero. 
As a result, the financial guru has encouraged investors to safeguard their funds by investing in real-world assets like Bitcoin. He has predicted the price of Bitcoin to soar to $100,000 within six months, anticipating the cryptocurrency to potentially rise to this value by September 2024. This forecast underscores the financial author’s bullish outlook on Bitcoin and his unwavering endorsement of the cryptocurrency’s potential.

U.S. Judge Rules SEC Lawsuit Against Coinbase Can Move Forward - The Defiant

The judge has ruled that through its staking program, Coinbase has operated as an unregistered intermediary of securities.A federal judge in Manhattan on Wednesday ruled the case between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and crypto exchange Coinbase can move forward.According to the ruling by Judge Katherine Polk, Coinbase has operated as an unregistered intermediary of securities–thanks in large part to the “well-pleaded allegations” of the Complaint by the SEC.“The Court finds that the SEC adequately alleges that Coinbase, through its staking program, engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities,” read the latest ruling.The lawsuit was filed on June 6 by the SEC, which argued that the largest exchange in the country was violating the nation’s securities rules and regulations.Coinbase WinCoinbase did score a win today, however. Polk sided with the company in dismissing the claim that the company acts as an unregistered broker by offering its Coinbase Wallet.Chief Legal Officer for Coinbase, Paul Grewal, posted on X today that the company was expecting the ruling, claiming early motions against government agencies are “almost always denied.”Grewal also called out lawmakers in Congress, encouraging the body to build on the momentum from last year regarding digital asset legislation, especially “If we want innovation to remain in the U.S.”The SEC has been on a tirade against the crypto industry, including court cases against Binance, and a number of tokens the agency called unregistered securities.The Coinbase versus the SEC case will now face a jury, although no date has been set for when court proceedings will commence. Both parties have until April 19 to propose a case management plan, said the judge.

Why is 2140 the end of bitcoin inflation? - Blockworks


It’s well known that the Bitcoin network experiences a halving of supply approximately every four years. Less appreciated is that these are set to continue for over a century into the future.
Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto programmed the year 2140 — 30 halvings from now — as the year that the block rewards (the subsidy paid to miners for processing transactions into blocks) would drop to less than one satoshi, the smallest unit of bitcoin.
The use of the term “satoshi” — equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin (or 0.00000001 BTC) — emerged organically among early Bitcoin users and developers, appearing in various forums and discussions starting in 2010 or 2011, and became widely accepted in 2013.
Read more: The Bitcoin halving is about a month away — here’s what you can expect
The halving is modeled after the physical mining of scarce resources, according to Jameson Lopp, co-founder and chief security officer at Casa.
“There’s nothing special about the year 2140,” Lopp told Blockworks. “It’s just how the nature of halvings along with the level of precision of satoshis ended up working out.”
Lopp notes that Nakamoto explained the supply schedule to Mike Hearn, a former Google engineer who became an early Bitcoin contributor, in 2009:
“My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess,” Satoshi wrote. “I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that’s very hard.”
Read more: Satoshi warned against labeling bitcoin as an ‘investment’
He picked 21 million, but Satoshi added that the divisibility of a bitcoin in practice could be represented differently depending on how valuable one bitcoin gets. “For example, if 0.001 is worth one euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had one bitcoin it’s now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as one.”
For what it’s worth, 0.001 BTC is worth about 65 euros (approximately $70) today.
Why the rate of issuance would decline for 132 years, however, was never explained.
“I expect it was more of a ‘better safe than sorry’ decision to give the system decades to bootstrap,” Lopp said.
Unless the price of bitcoin (BTC) doubles every four years, each halving brings less income from block rewards to miners. So to maintain the network’s hashrate, which is important for Bitcoin’s security, transaction fees will become more important over time.
Whether that will happen in practice remains to be seen, but Lopp is optimistic.
“I expect that as we see the multi-layered Bitcoin ecosystem continue to expand, the base chain will start to look more and more like a high-value cryptographic accumulator and it will make economic sense for on-chain transactions to pay relatively high fees,” he said.

PlanB's Poll Shows Strong Belief in Bitcoin's $100k Milestone by 2024


																With the Bitcoin halving drawing near, market participants are contemplating whether the asset has reached its peak or if there’s further room for growth and when the next upward shift might transpire.
Following a breather from a powerful uptrend, Bitcoin is slowly regaining its strength again as it trades above $69k. However, market participants remain optimistic about BTC’s trajectory and are confident that the leading crypto asset will claim a milestone by the end of this year.
According to PlanB’s latest poll on X (formerly Twitter), a staggering 71.9% of respondents anticipate Bitcoin reaching $100k by 2024, demonstrating bullish sentiment.
Meanwhile, 18.1% foresee this milestone in 2025, with only a modest 5.1% expecting it in 2026 or beyond. Surprisingly, a mere 4.9% doubt that the world’s largest crypto will ever achieve the coveted $100k mark.






The result does not seem far-fetched, considering there are multiple bullish catalysts at play.
For one, the Coinbase Premium Index has also flipped positive, which is indicative of renewed interest from both retail and institutional investors in the United States.
Spot Bitcoin ETF is also seeing notable inflows while new players are gearing up to offer similar products.
For example, asset management company Hashdex announced that it was venturing into the US spot Bitcoin ETF scene by converting its futures ETF to hold spot Bitcoin primarily.
Rebranded as the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, it will predominantly allocate its assets to spot Bitcoin, with a minor portion invested in Bitcoin futures contracts.
Earlier this week, renowned author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” Robert Kiyosaki, also advocated for Bitcoin as the top investment choice while simultaneously criticizing the US dollar for its fundamental flaws.

Shiba Inu Climbs To Second Spot In Crypto Searches As SHIB Rallies


                            The ever-vibrant Shiba Inu community is thriving once more as SHIB gains widespread recognition surpassing top cryptocurrency assets in the market to become the second most sought-after digital asset in the entire European continent, securing its stance in the crypto landscape.
Shiba Inu Takes Europe By Storm
XRP enthusiast and market expert Marcel Knobloch, also known as Collin Brown, reported the coin’s latest milestone on X. According to Brown, Shiba Inu has seen significant growth in its long-term investor base, taking Europe by storm by becoming the second most search crypto in the continent.
Brown noted that the milestone is reminiscent of the peak of 2021, having rallied a startling 300% in just 8 days. SHIB’s interest is not limited to Europe, and it has taken the top spot on search charts all the way from Italy to Nigeria.

As a result of the development, WazirX’s poll has crowned SHIB the king of meme cryptos. Thus, Collin Brown has urged the cryptocurrency space to watch out for Shiba Inu, noting that the Shiba pack is at the forefront of the race.
The rankings were determined following a comprehensive analysis of Google Trends data in the past 1 year in order to ascertain the cryptocurrency that, based on searches, each nation in Europe desires to invest in. After gathering collective data, the findings showed a noteworthy pattern that indicated changes in people’s interest in the crypto market.
Shiba Inu went past notable coins like Ethereum (ETH) – the second largest crypto asset, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) – the largest meme coin, securing the top pick in about 7 European countries. These include Russia, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and among others. 
Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) – the largest crypto asset remains the most searched coin in the continent acquiring top choice in about 21 European nations, such as Poland, Germany, Belgium, Romania, etc.
Latest Milestone Buttresses SHIB’s Price
SHIB’s recent achievement displays a constant rise in its interest, reflecting the trust of its community members around the world. In addition to bolstering SHIB’s standing, this ranking indicates that European investors are considering adopting the token even more.

Following the project’s landmark, the Ethereum-based memecoin has managed to secure gains of over 18% in the past week. SHIB has experienced a rebound to the $0.000030 threshold, after falling as low as $0.000025 during the start of the week. With the memecoin market demonstrating momentum presently, SHIB might be poised for more significant gains in the coming months.
Consequently, SHIB’s rise to the aforementioned price has taken advantage of the market’s general recovery and its seven-day upswing. As of the time of writing, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.0000305, indicating a decline of 1% in the past day. Meanwhile, its trading volume and market cap have decreased by over 1% and 16%, respectively.

Casa's multi-key solution for tackling self-custody Bitcoin inheritance

Bitcoin self-custody firm Casa is rolling out an inheritance feature aimed at streamlining the transfer of assets to benefactors from deceased estates.The inheritance of cryptocurrencies can be a complicated process, even more so if the owner of the digital assets has not made any provisions for their families or designated recipients to take control.Nick Neuman, co-founder and CEO of Casa, tells Cointelegraph that the inheritance of cryptocurrencies has long been an issue for crypto-natives looking to ensure that their digital holdings are passed on accordingly.“It’s not overlooked. Many people recognize it as a big problem they want to solve but they haven’t had good tools to solve it yet, so most people either don’t have a solution, or have cobbled together something that they hope will work but don’t feel good about,” Neuman said. Casa has offered an inheritance feature to its highest membership tier in the U.S. for the past few years. Neuman said the new offering will be available to all Casa members and differs from the existing high-tier feature, allowing users to transfer Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC) holdings to benefactors.Related: Casa Releases Self-Custody Bitcoin Wallet Focused on PrivacyThe offering aims to ensure that the process of managing cryptocurrency holdings of deceased individuals is straightforward, secure and resistant to malicious actors. Neuman said that instances where inheritance plans have not been made have been “precarious and stressful,” adding:“When we’ve tried to help recover assets for people who don’t have an inheritance plan and have passed away, it has taken anywhere from 6-12 months to figure everything out. Even then, the chance of actually recovering the assets is low.”The offering hinges on a Casa’s user designating a recipient to a specific token vault in its proprietary app. The recipient then creates a free Casa account and scans a QR code provided by the vault owner, which contains an encrypted version of the owner’s mobile key. Related: Casa launches multisignature Ethereum self-custody vaultThe key can only be imported by the specified account and the recipient can’t initially use it or see the vault balance as Neuman explains:“If the vault owner passes away, the recipient can request access to the vault in their Casa app. This starts a six month timer, and sends a ton of notifications every month to the owner.”If the owner is still alive, they can reject the request in their app. If the timer runs out after six months, the recipient can use the shared mobile key and request a signature from the Casa Recovery Key for the shared vault. This will give them 2 out of 3 signatures required to access the asset.Casa's inheritance feature allows a vault owner to assign encrypted keys to benefactors to access assets after their death. Source: CasaCasa will also offer a five-key vault, where one hardware key is shared with the recipient. The small increase in friction for recipients adds increased security and resilience of a five-key vault for larger holdings.Best guess estimates pin the value of lost Bitcoin at around $140 billion, of which misplaced keys are often a cause. Since its inception in 2016, Casa has promoted multisignature self-custody in the crypto industry. Its flagship Bitcoin vault allows users to store the cryptocurrency using up to five keys for more distributed security. Casa’s service originally catered to Bitcoin “whales” willing to spend $10,000 a year on custody before opening its service to a broader base of users. The company has now added an Ether vault to its platform, with ETH holders also able to use up to five keys to secure their holdings.Magazine: ‘SEAL 911’ team of white hats formed to fight crypto hacks in real time

The USDC balances on Coinbase are increasing.

In a strategic move aimed at taking advantage of lower fees and faster settlement times, Coinbase, one of the leading crypto exchanges, is gearing up to store a greater number of corporate and customer USDC balances on Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. 
The decision comes as Base’s Total Value Locked (TVL) surpasses the impressive milestone of 1 billion dollars, indicating a significant increase in user deposits and activities within the ecosystem.

USDC Balances Increasing on Coinbase
Branzburg, vice president and head of consumer products at Coinbase, highlighted the benefits of using Base infrastructure, stating: “This allows us to manage and protect customer funds with lower fees and faster settlement times, without any impact on the Coinbase user experience”. 
The move underscores Coinbase’s commitment to leveraging innovative solutions to improve operational efficiency and provide a seamless experience to its users.
The announcement was positively received, with Base collaborator Jesse Pollak expressing enthusiasm and support for Coinbase’s decision. Pollak described the move as “grounded” and said he was excited to continue assisting Coinbase in its journey towards harnessing blockchain technology.
Base, built on the open-source OP Stack, has seen a significant surge in its Total Value Locked, reaching over 1 billion dollars. Defi Llama data reveals that user deposits on Base have more than doubled since the beginning of the month, going from 470 million dollars to over 1 billion. 
This exponential growth highlights the increasing adoption and trust in Base’s capabilities as a Layer 2 scalability solution for Ethereum.
A significant portion of Base TVL can be attributed to the decentralized exchange Aerodrome, which has seen exponential growth since the beginning of February. The surge in transaction activity on Base, especially compared to other optimistic rollups like Arbitrum, highlights the increasing traction and utility of the platform in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.
While Base has seen a surge in the number of transactions, the daily transaction volume of OP Mainnet has recorded a more modest increase. This divergence in transaction activity highlights the unique value proposition offered by Layer 2 solutions like Base, which prioritize scalability, lower fees, and faster transaction settlement times.
The reason behind Coinbase’s decision
The decision by Coinbase to store a greater number of USDC balances on Base is indicative of a broader trend towards adopting blockchain-based solutions for financial infrastructures. By leveraging the capabilities of Layer 2 scaling solutions, companies like Coinbase can streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency.
Furthermore, Coinbase’s approval of Base could potentially pave the way for greater adoption by other companies and institutions within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As more entities recognize the benefits of on-chain solutions like Base, it is expected that momentum towards mainstream acceptance and use of blockchain technology will accelerate.
In conclusion, Coinbase’s decision to increase USDC balances on Base underscores the platform’s commitment to innovation and efficiency in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. 
With Base’s total locked value surpassing one billion dollars and transaction activity on the rise, the collaboration between Coinbase and Base marks a significant milestone in the journey towards a more scalable, efficient, and inclusive financial ecosystem powered by blockchain technology. 
As the sector continues to mature, we expect to see further advancements and partnerships aimed at unlocking the full potential of decentralized finance.

Sam Bankman-Fried to be sentenced in FTX collapse: What to know

Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced cryptocurrency executive, will receive his prison sentence on Thursday. If prosecutors get what they want, the former CEO of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX could serve 40 to 50 years in prison. Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?Here’s what you should know.Who is Sam Bankman-Fried?Sam Bankman-Fried, also known as “SBF,” launched the cryptocurrency exchange FTX in 2019, and it went bankrupt in 2022. Born in 1992 in California, he grew up in an academic family, with both of his parents professors at Stanford Law School.He earned a physics degree with a minor in mathematics from MIT in 2014. While in the program, he worked as an intern in 2013 for the trading firm Jane Street Capital in New York. It was there that he met Caroline Ellison, who later became his girlfriend. Ellison would become the CEO of Alameda Research, a quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm and SBF’s first company, founded in 2017. It was later discovered that he built FTX to support Alameda’s trading business.What was FTX?Bankman-Fried co-founded the crypto exchange FTX in 2019 with American computer programmer Gary Wang. As the covid-19 pandemic later boosted cryptocurrency trading worldwide, FTX rode the wave. In 2020, FTX purchased Blockfolio, the market’s leading mobile news and portfolio tracking app, for $150 million. SBF appeared as a speaker at various crypto and blockchain conferences, attracting a large following.How did it collapse, and what happened next?In November 2022, the crypto news website CoinDesk reported on FTX’s poor balance sheet and liquidity crisis. Big names such as cryptocurrency exhange Binance opted not to provide any support to FTX or Bankman-Fried.The cryptocurrency exchange collapsed overnight, resulting in a loss of $10 billion in customer funds. This had a ripple effect on other crypto companies, throwing them into financial turmoil.Several companies with direct or indirect connections to FTX — including BlockFi, Voyager, Celsius, Genesis, and Gemini — went bankrupt in a matter of weeks. The cryptocurrency market saw its darkest period to-date, resulting in a loss of more than $1 trillion, and Bitcoin’s price dropped below $18,000.What was Sam Bankman-Fried convicted of?Once a crypto icon, Sam Bankman-Fried became a fraudster. Federal prosecutors filed both criminal and civil charges against Sam Bankman-Fried and other top FTX executives in late 2022. They were accused of misappropriating $10 billion in customer deposits and with generating false financial statements.The court appearances of FTX’s top executives attracted widespread attention — as did their romantic lives.In November of 2023, a federal jury in New York convicted Bankman-Fried of fraud for stealing at least $10 billion from customers and investors.What sentences are prosecutors and defense lawyers seeking?When he returns to court today, Bankman-Fried will be sentenced. Prosecutors are seeking 40-50 years in prison, while Bankman-Fried’s lawyers are asking for only 5-6 years in prison. His lawyers have cited medical conditions including neurodiversity and autism, making him “uniquely vulnerable in a prison population,” as well as Bankman-Fried’s desire to make “the world a better place” and his remorse over the collapse of the crypto exchange.

KuCoin, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has reported a staggering outflow of $1.78 billion from the Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains.According to on-chain analytics firm Nansen, there has been an outflow of over $842 million on Ethereum and $938 million on EVM chains over the last 24 hours, amounting to a total of $1.78 billion.Estimated from an initial $6 billion base in holdings, this represents more than a 15% drop in assets held by the exchange. According to Nansen, a look at chains beyond Ethereum and other chains like Bitcoin and Solana indicated a drop of $818 million.Since the news broke that KuCoin and two of its founders had been charged with breaking anti-money laundering rules by U.S. federal prosecutors, there has been an increase in withdrawals from the platform. The exchange also recorded outflows of stablecoins in response to the news.On Tuesday, U.S. prosecutors charged KuCoin and two of its founders for failing to comply with U.S. anti-money laundering rules. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which controls derivatives markets, filed a lawsuit against the firm on the same day.KuCoin CEO reacts"As the People's Exchange, we prioritize user asset security above all else. All operations, including deposits and withdrawals, are normal," Kucoin CEO Johnny Lyu said in a reassuring statement to users, while adding that legal matters were being handled by the legal team.Lyu added, "The challenge we're facing is not unique to KuCoin but rather typical growth and regulatory issues encountered by emerging industries. Early-stage development often sees regulatory gaps, but as the industry matures, we move towards and embrace compliance and standardization."KuCoin is one of the largest spot crypto exchanges in the world, with a daily trading volume of more than $2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The exchange holds over $6 billion in assets across Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana and other chains.

                        Crypto custody firm Copper reportedly threw a London party where attendees were served sushi off two partially-clad models.The Financial Times reported Wednesday that the private function, dubbed “The Copper Experience,” was held last week. The venue for this event, held after the Digital Assets Summit 2024, was the 5-star Mandrake Hotel in London’s Fitzrovia.Per an image the FT obtained, a red-lacquered dining room reportedly featured two individuals in minimal attire positioned on a long table, with sushi served directly on their bodies.The outlet said that the after-party invitation promised a multi-sensory experience: “Attendees will be able to entertain and explore all five senses.”Copper didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.A senior Copper employee told the FT that having scantily clad people was not the typical party set-up. They added that: “Crypto is getting a lot more civilized, so that’s not really the style.”Regulatory Headaches in UK Led Copper to Pursue Swiss Registration
Copper specializes in digital asset custody and trading services tailored to institutional investors. Its offerings include a scalable settlement network, custody-integrated staking, and automated wallet services.Notably, in 2023, the company appointed former UK Chancellor Philip Hammond as its chairman. He was reportedly not in attendance at the controversial event.Facing challenges in obtaining approval from the UK’s financial regulatory authority, Copper withdrew its application to operate in the country in 2022. Instead, it shifted focus toward securing registration in Switzerland.Male-Dominated Culture in Industry Underlines Concerns Over Event
An insider close to the company described the situation as more akin to flamboyant performance art than anything salacious. They also revealed that the models were a man and woman, clad in swimwear.The practice of serving sushi off semi-clad bodies, known as nyotaimori, has gained attention in Western countries as an exotic cultural experience inspired by Japanese traditions. This tradition, although available in certain Western locations, remains on the fringes, even within Japan’s expansive erotic entertainment industry.Despite its occasional portrayal in media and popular culture, nyotaimori dinners are not widely adopted. They are also not considered a commonplace practice, either in Japan or Western societies.The FT highlighted concerns around a prevalent culture of “crypto bros,” characterized by male dominance in major companies, as a persistent issue. This culture has been linked to governance failures, exemplified by the collapse of exchanges like FTX.Hosting a Nyotaimori dinner, which is seen as potentially objectifying, may be viewed as perpetuating this problematic culture and further highlighting governance shortcomings within the industry.

Staked Ethereum reaches weekly high: How whales played a part - AMBCrypto



Deposits on the chain have outpaced withdrawals this week.
The number of ETH staked decreased as the price of the altcoin jumped.

In three separate transactions, a whale sent 12,800 Ethereum [ETH] to the Beacon Chain on the 27th of March. According to Whale Alert, the first transfer was 6400 ETH, valued at $23.05 million.
The subsequent ones were also with the same amount.
For the uninitiated, the Beacon Chain has been a key part of Ethereum since it transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). With the chain, users can participate in governance, act as validators, and also stake their ETH.
It’s raining interest on the chain
Previously, the Beacon Chain only allowed deposits via a contract. However, the 2023 Shanghai upgrade changed that and provided validators to withdraw their staked assets.
AMBCrypto’s evaluation showed that these transactions mentioned above have had a positive impact on the staking sector.
At press time, Nansen data showed that deposits since the beginning of the week tapped a new high.
Source: Nansen
Details from our examination showed that ETH deposits were as high as 80,463. However, withdrawals could not match up as the number was 49,101 ETH as of this writing.
This difference was proof that validators, who were to deposit a minimum of 23 ETH, trusted Ethereum to produce a good yield. In total, 23.9 million ETH has been deposited since Shanghai.
Withdrawals, on the other hand, have been lower at 10.1 million.
As expected, Lido Finance [LDO] led the top entities’ cohort. However, there has been a change in the supply of ETH staked. In a previous article, AMBCrypto reported how nearly 30% of the supply was locked.
Price increases drive withdrawals
But press time data showed that the ratio has declined to 26%. This decrease could be connected to the surge in withdrawals at different times.
Furthermore, on-chain data showed that as the price of ETH increased, the deposits fell.
From the chart below, you can see that the amount of staking deposits when the cryptocurrency traded between $2,500 and $3,000 was higher than when the value was over $4,000.
Source: Nansen
This data explains that some validators were satisfied with the reward as those prices. If this trend continues, then deposits on Ethereum’s Beacon Chain might reduce as the price increases.
However, the sentiment might change considering what happened when ETH changed hands below $1,500 and when it traded above it.
In the meantime, ETH’s price was $3,585. This value was a 2.05% decrease in the last 24 hours. Despite the recent decline, there have been bullish predictions for the cryptocurrency.

Realistic or not, here’s ETH’s market cap in BTC terms

If these predictions come to pass, then it might instill confidence in validators waiting on the sidelines to lock their assets.
At the same time, those who have staked at a much lower value could view the hike as an opportunity to get their yield.

Solana's Jupiter DEX kickstarts native DAO with $137M in initial capital

Solana decentralized exchange (DEX) Jupiter is allocating 10 million USD Coin (USDC) and 100 million of its native JCP token ($127 million), worth a combined $137 million at the time of publication, to kickstart its Jupiter DAO.As announced on March 27, the budget "provides the DAO the capability to fund the ideas with USDC and have the JUP allocation for long term incentive alignment with J.U.P Catributors," developers wrote, continuing: “To ensure that the DAO will be able to execute on these crucial things over the long term, we will aim to top up the same budget on a yearly basis." For additional contributions, developers raised the following example: "If the DAO ends the year with 1.5M USDC and 50M JUP, the team will replenish 8.5M USDC from revenues and an additional 50M JUP will be transferred from the community cold wallets."At its inception, the ecosystem funds are stored in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) multisig wallet with three initial members, with plans to expand access to more custodians within the coming weeks. Parallel to the announcement, the Jupiter DAO wallet address was funded with two separate transactions of USDC and JCP. 


Jupiter is currently one of the most popular decentralized applications on the Solana blockchain, with $381.49 million in total value locked (TVL), having grown 86% month over month. The DEX accounts for approximately 8% of the Solana ecosystem’s total TVL at the time of publication. The token currently has a fully diluted market cap of $12.5 billion. With a gain of 807% in the past year, Solana has become one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. A huge part of that growth was driven by the recent memecoin craze. On March 25, Jeo Boden (BODEN), a Solana memecoin parody of United States President Joe Biden, surpassed $250 million in market cap with a gain of 54% within the past 24 hours. Related: Solana takes the lead in weekly stablecoin transfer volume

UK crypto firm Copper pictured hosting party with nude sushi servers


UK crypto firm Copper, which is chaired by the country’s former chancellor Sir Phillip Hammond, has raised eyebrows after hosting a private dinner party at a luxury London hotel that served guests sushi on two partly naked models.
Copper invited guests to the crypto conference after-party at the five-star Mandrake Hotel last week and promised that “Attendees will be able to entertain and explore all five senses,” and “Transcend the ordinary at the Copper experience.” 
The Financial Times obtained a picture of the event during which one male and one female model, seemingly dressed in thin bodysuits, can be seen semi-naked serving sushi off their bodies. 
Photo of the Copper dinner party shared with the Financial Times. 
The event is reminiscent of nyotaimori, an old Japanese custom where sushi is served to guests from the bodies of laid-down naked women. 
Crypto dinner party more ‘art’ than ‘seedy’
A person close to Copper told the Financial Times the dinner party was “a lot of razzle-dazzle . . . more performative art than anything seedy.” They said the models were “wearing swimming costumes,” and that Copper’s chairman, Hammond, didn’t attend. 
In addition, a Copper spokesperson told the Financial Times, “As part of our sponsorship of the Digital Assets Summit 2024, we jointly hosted an after-party held at the Mandrake Hotel.” It said the event “was organized by a third-party event planner and open to all delegates as part of the conference.”

Copper offers various financial entities the ability to trade crypto on exchanges. It was founded by Dmitry Tokarev in 2018 and has been chaired by Hammond since 2023.  
The firm was reported to have sent $4.2 million worth of ETH to Jonatan Zimenkov, a member of a Russian arms dealing network controlled by his father. In addition, Copper has been accused of acting as an intermediary in a shares sale to help a Russian oligarch skirt US sanctions.

Bitcoin Whales Go On $7 Billion Buying Spree, New ATH Soon?


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin whales have gone on a huge buying spree in the past week, a sign that could be bullish for the coin’s value.
Bitcoin Whales Have Scooped Up More Than 100,000 BTC Recently
As pointed out by analyst Ali in a post on X, the BTC whales have purchased more than 100,000 BTC over the last week. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution” metric from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment.
This indicator tells us about the total amount of Bitcoin that the different wallet groups in the market are holding right now. The addresses are divided into these cohorts based on the total number of coins that they are carrying in their balance.

The 1-10 coins group, for instance, includes all wallets holding at least 1 and at most 10 BTC. In the context of the current discussion, the whale cohort is the one of interest. These humongous entities are typically defined as investors owning between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC.
The chart below shows how the ‘Supply Distribution’ for the Bitcoin whales has changed over the past few months:

Looks like the value of the metric has shot up in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X
As displayed in the above graph, the total amount of Bitcoin supply held by the 1,000-10,000 BTC group has registered a significant jump over the past week or so.
During this buying spree, the BTC whales have added more than 100,000 BTC to their holdings, worth upwards of $7 billion at the current exchange rate of the cryptocurrency.
This latest accumulation from the whales started when BTC was trading around its recent lows, so it’s possible that these large investors believed those prices to be low enough to be profitable entry points, which is why they bought big at them.
As this buying has occurred, BTC’s bullish momentum has reignited, with its price now surging back above the $70,000 level. Given the close timing, it would appear that the whale accumulation was in part a driver for the rally.
Between the start of the year and the end of February, these humongous holders had been continuously buying more of the asset, with their holdings riding on an uptrend.
As the rally progressed further, though, these investors started falling for the allure of profit-taking as they had shifted towards a trend of net distribution instead.

With the recent buying, however, not only has the trend of net distribution reversed, but the supply of the whales has in fact also returned back to levels similar to the ones seen before the distribution had first begun.
If the Bitcoin whales can keep up this buying in the coming days, then the latest rally may be able to continue further, just like how it was earlier in the year.
Naturally, a continuation from here would mean the possibility of a brand new all-time high, as BTC currently isn’t far from setting one.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around the $71,000 mark, up more than 11% in the last seven days.

‘This Cycle Is Different’ - $86,000,000,000 in Institutional Money Enters Bitcoin in Just Six Months: CryptoQuant CEO - The Daily Hodl


								The head of blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant says that Bitcoin’s (BTC) current market cycle is like none other before for one key reason.
Ki Young Ju tells his 340,700 followers on the social media platform X that the level of Bitcoin investment from institutional investors is unprecedented this cycle, totaling $86 billion in the last six months alone.










CryptoQuant’s data shows an explosion in Bitcon’s Realized Cap for short-term whales, or the value of the BTC at the price they were last transacted on-chain divided by the number of bitcoins among the cohort, suggesting a massive new presence of institutional money.
“This cycle is different. Institutional funds of $86 billion entered the Bitcoin market in the past six months.”

The analyst says that the buying demand for Bitcoin appears to be outpacing the selling supply as the liquid inventory ratio indicator reaches an all-time low.
“Liquid inventory ratio reached an all-time low. Sell-side liquidity is currently much lower than historical levels relative to demand.”
Source: Ki Young Ju/X
According to the analytics expert, the liquid inventory ratio is calculated by dividing the total sell-side inventory by the 30-day Bitcoin balance change of accumulation addresses.

Bitcoin is trading for $68,760 at time of writing, down nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.

Tether expands AI operations with global recruitment drive for top-tier talent

Tether Operations Limited, the blockchain and cryptocurrency company behind the Tether stablecoin, has announced a strategic expansion of its artificial intelligence (AI) focus alongside a global recruitment drive for “top-tier” talent for its AI division.The expanded strategic focus comes amid concerns “over the monopolization of AI technologies by Big Tech,” according to a press release from Tether. The company said its Tether Data division “is stepping forward to champion transparency and privacy in AI model development.”Tether also said the company's strategic AI expansion would build on its previous operations, including its recent investment in Northern Data Group. A company spokesperson told Cointelegraph:“Tether plans to push the boundaries of AI technology, not only making high-performance and privacy-preserving AI technologies accessible for personal use but also setting new industry standards for innovation and utility.

This Indicator Could Send Ethereum Skrocketing Above $5,000 ⋆ ZyCrypto

In crypto, prices can soar to crazy heights or plummet unexpectedly. Traders are constantly seeking reliable indicators to gauge the future trajectory of their favourite coins. Ethereum has recently been the subject of intense speculation. As it has faced market uncertainty and regulatory questions, a key technical indicator has emerged, suggesting a potential bullish rally that could send Ethereum’s price to new heights by the end of 2024.



The Mayer Multiple Indicator



At the heart of this optimistic prediction lies the Mayer Multiple oscillator, a technical tool crypto analysts use to forecast price movements with notable accuracy. Calculated as the difference between Ethereum’s current price and its 200-day moving average, the Mayer Multiple has shown a bullish signal for Ethereum.



According to data from a prominent crypto analyst, the Mayer Multiple indicates a promising outlook for Ethereum’s price trajectory. Despite recent market volatility that has seen Ethereum’s value drop to $3,300, the Mayer Multiple suggests that Ethereum could surge past the $5,400 mark before the close of 2024.



Ethereum Facing Regulatory Issues



While the Mayer Multiple paints a rosy picture of Ethereum’s future, the cryptocurrency is not immune to the challenges plaguing the broader crypto market. Regulatory concerns, particularly, come from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is reportedly investigating its regulatory classification.



The SEC’s inquiry into whether Ethereum should be classified as a security has raised concerns among investors and industry stakeholders about the potential implications for Ethereum’s future. The investigation, which involves subpoenas issued to various companies linked to the Ethereum Foundation, shows the regulatory difficulties crypto projects have to deal with.

Coinbase’s Stance Against Regulation



Coinbase took a stance against the SEC’s investigation. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, has denied any suggestion that Ethereum’s regulatory status is uncertain. Citing previous statements from senior SEC officials, including Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman and SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Grewal has solidified Ethereum’s classification as a commodity rather than a security.



In the fast-paced world of crypto, where uncertainty and volatility are the norm, investors often look to technical indicators for guidance. The Mayer Multiple’s bullish signal gives optimism to Ethereum investors, and the potential for a surge to $5,000 by the end of 2024 might still be on the cards. As challenges remain, the next few months will be crucial for Ethereum in deciding its future trajectory.

Decentralized AI Pioneers Join Forces to Launch the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a move that could potentially reshape the landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) development, three prominent decentralized AI projects – Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET – have announced their decision to merge and form the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. According to a press release dated March 27, 2024, this alliance aims to create an open-source, decentralized platform that challenges the dominance of Big Tech companies in the AI sector.



The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is the brainchild of three visionary leaders in the decentralized AI space: Dr. Ben Goertzel, the founder of SingularityNET; Humayun Sheikh, the creator of Fetch.ai; and Trent McConaghy, the founder of Ocean Protocol. By combining their expertise and resources, they seek to accelerate the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) on the blockchain, ensuring that this transformative technology is accessible to all and not controlled by a select few.



One of the key aspects of the merger is the unification of the three projects’ native tokens – $FET, $OCEAN, and $AGIX – into a single token called $ASI. This new token will serve as the backbone of the merged decentralized AI network, which has a combined token value of $7.6 billion as of March 26, 2024.



The founders of the alliance believe that the development of AGI and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) should be conducted in an open, transparent, and decentralized manner. By joining forces, they aim to create an AI ecosystem that prioritizes ethics, transparency, and direct collaboration between developers and users, minimizing the influence of centralized authorities and traditional gatekeepers.



Several factors have contributed to the decision to form the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, including the rapid advancements in AI technology, the significant growth experienced by the three projects involved, and the desire to establish a robust, decentralized AI infrastructure. The alliance seeks to leverage the combined strengths of SNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol to create a scalable platform that promotes ethical and trustworthy AI practices.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Furthermore, the formation of the alliance is expected to drive increased investment in AGI research and development. By facilitating the commercialization of each foundation’s technology and providing access to cutting-edge AI platforms and extensive databases, the alliance hopes to accelerate progress towards realizing AGI on the blockchain.



If the token merger proposal is approved by the respective communities, $FET will be rebranded as $ASI, with a total supply of 2.63055 billion tokens. $AGIX and $OCEAN tokens will be converted to $ASI at rates of 0.433350:1 and 0.433226:1, respectively.



The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance will be governed by a council comprising Ben Goertzel, Humayun Sheikh, Bruce Pon, and Trent McConaghy. While the three merging networks’ parent organizations – Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol Foundation, and SNET Foundation – will remain separate entities, they will work closely together within the shared $ASI tokenomic ecosystem.



The alliance has set its sights on ambitious objectives, such as developing a decentralized neural-symbolic AGI system that surpasses current large language models (LLMs) in areas like logical reasoning, scientific understanding, and creative expression. If successful, this system could have far-reaching implications for the global economy and usher in a new era of decentralized AGI and ASI.

SEC sues Coinbase for offering unregistered crypto securities

Photo: Dado Ruvic (Reuters)Cryptocurrency is decentralized — which means that it’s not controlled by any authority, such as a government or bank. Then, who regulates crypto? It’s a million-dollar question no one knows the answer to, but the U.S. legal system wants to figure it out.Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?On Wednesday, a judge ruled that the SEC can pursue its lawsuit against crypto exchange Coinbase for engaging in unregistered securities sales. U.S. District Court Judge Katherine Polk Failla  for the Southern District of New York wrote in her ruling, “The ‘crypto’ nomenclature may be of recent vintage, but the challenged transactions fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years.”The court rejected Coinbase’s request to dismiss the SEC’s complaint.A big win for the SEC The SEC has consistently pushed crypto companies to comply with federal securities laws. Chair Gary Gensler, who once taught a digital asset course at MIT, wants crypto to become a part of the agency’s regulatory sphere. The latest ruling could be the SEC’s first victory in its fight against cryptocurrency compliance since it is also considering classifying Ether as a security.What does it mean for the crypto industry?Coinbase will continue fighting the SEC in court, which will take time. In the interim, the financial watchdog may crack down on other cryptocurrencies and crypto firms that don’t comply with the law. It is widely believed that federal law is not sufficient to regulate cryptocurrencies in general, due to the way they differ from stocks. This latest ruling may pave the way for better regulation of cryptocurrencies in the country.Meanwhile, Coinbase’s shares fell 2.5% Wednesday after the news. At the time of writing, the price was hovering around $262.

Ethereum reclaims NFT throne with US$17.02 mln in daily sales


Ethereum reclaimed its position as the top-ranking blockchain in the non-fungible tokens (NFT) market on Wednesday, with daily sales reaching US$17.02 million. 
The platform saw an increase of 39.19% in sales in the 24 hours to 2 p.m. ET, according to data from CryptoSlam. Ethereum’s all-time sales volume rose to US$43.36 billion, which is the highest in the industry.
Ethereum dethroned Bitcoin for the top daily sales spot after the latter had held the position for two days. 
This marks the second consecutive week where Bitcoin led the market on Monday and Tuesday, only to concede the lead to Ethereum by Wednesday.



Bitcoin and Solana ranked second and third for the day, respectively, with Bitcoin experiencing a near 30% decrease in sales to US$11.61 million, while Solana’s sales dipped slightly by 4.17%, totaling US$6.79 million. 
Despite the decrease, Bitcoin inches closer to US$3 billion in all-time NFT sales volume, now about US$23 million away.
It is on pace to become the fourth network in history to pass the mark.
Polygon recorded the fourth highest sales volume on Wednesday with a 6.35% increase in sales over the last 24 hours, reaching US$1.13 million.



Polygon’s sales volume reached at least US$1 million for the first time this week.
Mythos Chain, the fifth NFT network for the day had US$1.06 million in sales.
Immutable dropped out of the top 5 position on Wednesday after suffering a 20% sales slump to US$725,679.

Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Challenges Hype: Metaverse Is Still Misunderstood


																Metaverse has gained tremendous traction over the past couple of years, grabbing the attention of large companies across the world.
But Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, believes the concept of the Metaverse is still “poorly defined” and needs to have several elements to make it meaningful.
Dissecting Metaverse
During a Q&A session while speaking at the BUIDL Asia conference in Seoul, Buterin pointed out a common misconception in associating the Metaverse solely with virtual reality (VR). The Ethereum co-founder argued that VR often leads people to imagine complex environments, whereas the actual needs tend to be simpler.
He illustrated this by suggesting that what people truly desire is the functionality of a laptop without the physical device itself, essentially implying that while VR may have its utility, it doesn’t necessarily constitute a true Metaverse experience.
“To me, Metaverse is one of those things which are very poorly defined. Like a brand’s name more than a product. It feels like everyone has this abstract idea that there is a virtual universe that they can all participate in and that the virtual universe is not actually owned by anyone. But the challenge is that they often get connected to virtual reality.
But with virtual reality, the kinds of things that people actually need end up being much simpler. You basically want a laptop without a laptop. That’s super useful but not a ‘verse’.”
True Metaverse Fusion: Crypto, VR, AI
According to Buterin, a true Metaverse experience may emerge from combining existing virtual world elements, including certain aspects of crypto, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence, rather than from attempts to create a Metaverse-like environment directly.




“The thing that I expect most similar to a metaverse that actually makes sense is not something that tries to be a metaverse. But something that takes all of the different virtual world things that we already have including part of crypto, VR, AI and combining them together in the right way.”

Here’s Why The Cardano Price Is Struggling Below $0.7


                            A plausible explanation has emerged for why the Cardano (ADA) price has dropped below the psychological price level of $0.7. The crypto token saw a sharp correction from its monthly peak of $0.8, recorded on March 14, and has since failed to recover such a height. 
Cardano Whales Responsible For Price Decline
Data from the crypto analytics platform Santiment shows that the whale transaction count ($100,000 and above) on the network has reduced since March 14. That period was when Cardano hit a high of $0.8, which suggests that ADA whales began to take profits from then and have slowly exited their positions since then. 

Crypto whales are known to have a massive impact on the market, and prices usually drop as soon as these traders begin to offload their holdings. Moreover, this wave of profit-taking isn’t peculiar only to the ADA ecosystem; these past few weeks have been marred by investors taking profits from different crypto tokens in which they were invested. 
The flagship crypto, Bitcoin, was also not spared. Investors decided to take profits after weeks of seeing BTC make a parabolic run on its way to a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,750. Meanwhile, long-term ADA holders also looked to have used the opportunity to take some profits, as data from Santiment shows that a considerable amount of dormant ADA tokens were also transacted during that period.
Specifically, March 20 was a busy day for these long-term holders as 200 million ADA tokens (which had been dormant for a year) moved on that day. 
Time For ADA To Run To $1
Like the broader crypto market, Cardano looks to be recovering from this recent wave of profit-taking, although at a slower pace. For its next leg up, there is the belief that the crypto token could finally break the $1 resistance. Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello recently predicted that ADA could rise to between $1.4 and $1.5 if it can break out from the $0.8 price range. 

ADA whales are likely to soon return to the fold with whale transctions higher than $100,00 expected to pick up soon enough. A spike in these trasaction count would suggest that these investors are taking advantage of ADA’s current decline to accumulate more of the crypto token. That is something that could contribute to a rise in ADA’s price depending on how bullish these investors are on ADA going forward. 
At the time of writing, ADA is trading at around $0.6513, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Arbitrum Whales Move Millions in Tokens to Exchanges Amid Market Speculation, Triggering Mixed Community Reactions



                    
In March, a significant movement of Arbitrum‘s ARB tokens into exchanges was observed, particularly following the release of a considerable volume of vested tokens. 



Lookonchain, a blockchain data platform, reported on March 23 that four wallets had moved ARB tokens to exchanges, subsequent to a $2.32 billion token unlock on March 16. 




Specifically, 11.34 million ARB tokens, valued at $18.5 million, were deposited into Binance across four transactions.



The crypto community has been divided over these transactions. One member did not see it as a negative indicator, while another expressed skepticism about ARB’s potential to appreciate. 



This followed a previous instance where 11 whales deposited significant amounts of ARB into exchanges on March 18, after Arbitrum, a layer-2 blockchain initiative, unlocked $2.3 billion in tokens.

The allocation included 673.5 million ARB for team and advisers, with another 438.25 million for investors, all released at once, raising concerns of a potential market dump.



Subsequent to the token release, ARB’s price trajectory has been downward. From a high of $2.22 on March 13, it fell to $1.84 by the unlock date, March 16.



 The following week saw fluctuations, reaching a low of $1.48 and a high of $1.79, with a price of $1.70 at the time of reporting. 



According to CoinGecko, this marked a nearly 29% decrease from its January 12 all-time high of $2.39.



This series of events and the market’s response have hinted at a potential continuation of the bearish trend. 



Adding to the speculation, Token Unlocks, a vesting tracker, revealed that another 92.65 million ARB tokens are set to be released for advisers, the team, and investors on April 16, which could further impact the market dynamics.

FTX attorneys are pushing for several "Sam Coins" to be zeroed in its bankruptcy proceedings - but what does it mean for creditors?
                        Cryptocurrency exchange FTX is looking to declare its creditors’ “Sam Coins” effectively worthless amidst the company’s lengthy bankruptcy proceedings, court documents from a Tuesday hearing in Delaware show.FTX Declares “Sam Coins” Worthless
Lawyers for FTX Trading LTD. hired NYU Professor of Finance Sabrina Howell to conduct a valuation analysis on a number of “Sam Coins,” including Serum, Maps, and Oxygen.According to Howell’s research, Serum’s $509 million in claims should be reduced by nearly 60%, while both Oxygen and Maps should be devalued to zero given that the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange held nearly 95% of the tokens.“The customers attribute values to claims on digital assets assuming a market that never has and never will exist,” FTX attorney Brian D. Glueckenstein of Sullivan and Cromwell said.FTX Creditors Challenge NYU Professor’s “Sam Coins” Analysis
Lawyers for FTX creditors notably pushed back against the method of Howell’s analysis, with Maps Vault Attorney Jefferey Torosian calling her assessment of the digital assets’ value “illogical.”Attorney Kurt F. Glynne, who is representing nearly $250 million in claims linked to Oxygen and Maps, further criticized the data presented by FTX attorneys as “fundamentally flawed.”“Her analysis should be given no weight,” he continued.The Convoluted Journey of FTX’s Bankruptcy Proceedings
The latest FTX hearing comes just days after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey was ordered to approve the appointment of independent examiner Robert J. Cleary to investigate law firm Sullivan and Cromwell’s potential conflicts of interest in relation to the crypto exchange.Dorsey’s original February 2023 rejection of an independent examiner in the case was overruled just two months ago by a federal appeals court. Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo cited the decision’s benefits for the entire cryptocurrency sector, including bringing shady business dealings “under scrutiny” while “alerting potential investors to undisclosed credit risks in other cryptocurrency companies.”Attorney John J. Ray III, who is spearheading FTX’s bankruptcy efforts as CEO, previously opposed an independent examiner in the case, citing exorbitant costs.Bankman-Fried was convicted last November on fraud charges for misappropriating over $8 billion worth of customer funds which prosecutors argued went towards funding the FTX founder’s lavish lifestyle.Meanwhile, a number of close friends and family of Bankman-Fried have pushed U.S. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan for leniency in the leadup to his scheduled sentencing on March 28 in Manhattan federal court.Serum was trading at $0.062 as of writing, while Maps and Oxygen were valued at $0.034 and $0.013, respectively.

As The Market Regains Momentum In the Bull Market, Which Exceptional Projects Has Foresight X Identified? - Benzinga

Whenever the market transitions from a bear market to a bull market, there is a significant surge in market liquidity. For investors, how to seize the opportunity and identify the investments with the highest potential for gains during this period? Historically, VCs have been adept at implementing "counter-cyclical" strategies and discerning shifts in market sentiment. They typically capitalize on opportunities ahead of others: during bear markets, they broaden their investment scope, leveraging their advantages such as market insights and incubation resources, which individual investors may not have access to. This allows them to position themselves ahead of the curve in promising sectors and projects, ultimately benefiting from the early gains of the bull market through the wealth effect of leading tokens. Using the pivotal year of 2023 as a case in point, various concepts such as the Bitcoin BTC/USD Ecosystem, Solana SOL/USD Ecosystem, LSD Protocol, Modularity, and Re-Staking have taken center stage in succession. Whether it's the initial surge of excitement surrounding BTC Layer 2 infrastructure driven by the Ordinals, or the remarkable performance of modular new projects like SEI SEI/USD and TIA TIA/USD, many of these represent early-stage investments that leading VCs had strategically positioned themselves in. Therefore, for ordinary users, tracking the project allocation of VCs, particularly prominent ones, undoubtedly offers the most indicative direction. Essentially, the investment landscape of VCs comprises "premium seed players" filtered through their investment research and industry judgment—the more exceptional a VC's track record, the greater its reference value.

SUI Token Brushes $2 Peg in Rally Near All-Time High - DailyCoin


        
The SUI token has reached a new year-high trading price.



SUI has maintained a positive upward trend over the past months.



The crypto market is struggling to rebound following a week-long downward trend.
SUI, the native token of the Layer-1 blockchain and smart contract platform dedicated to digital asset ownership Sui, has thrived over the past months, outperforming most assets with new milestones in trading price and across its broader ecosystem. Despite the current cautious sentiment across the market, the native token has managed to buck the trend, notching healthy gains in recent weeks.SUI has continued the upward trajectory and breached its month-long price resistance to new heights. SUI Hits $2 in Fresh Rally StartOn Wednesday, March 27, SUI started its trading session on a strong note, rallying to a new year-to-date price high of $2.06.The surge marks a 17% increase in SUI’s price over the past 24 hours, bringing the token total gains over the past month to a healthy 28.3%.While SUI has quickly slipped below its newly reclaimed peg, the token’s bullish trend over the past three months, which has seen a staggering 143% upward notch in price, is fueling optimism regarding its ability to reclaim the peg and breach its all-time high trading price of $2.16.At press time, SUI is wavering at a trading price of $1.97, shedding nearly half of its gains over the past hour. However, despite this recent decline, the token price increase has outpaced most assets, many of which are struggling to recover from their week-long downward trend.Bitcoin Leads Market SlipFollowing an impressive rally to new price heights in the past weeks, the crypto market has experienced a bearish sentiment, with many assets slipping to new lows and surrendering gains.



Leading the charge is Bitcoin (BTC), which has slipped approximately 5.6% from its all-time high of $73,780. It is currently trading at $67,786, still marking a 10% rebound from its week-low.Other cryptocurrencies including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have dropped by approximately 14% and 11% from their year-high trading prices, positioning both as some of the top losers of the past week. Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Binance Coin (BNB) also joined the ranks of losers, each experiencing declines of 23%, 16%, and 9% respectively.On the Flipside
Despite SUI’s upward tick, the token current price is down 10.2% from its all-time high.



The total value locked on Sui has surged by an impressive 248% over the past three months, reaching $696 million from its year-start value of $200 million.



Sui has recently debuted its first-ever global conference in collaboration with Mysten Labs. 
Why This MattersThe surge in SUI’s price aligns highlights its ability to defy negative market trends and mount up impressive gains. However, SUI’s journey to reclaim its all-time high price after over a year is not solely reliant on past achievements, and its ability to sustain the present momentum amidst market volatility will dictate its trajectory.

KuCoin and Its Founders Hit With Criminal Charges in U.S., Samson Mow Makes Bold Bitcoin ETF Prediction for This Week, SHIB Braces for Ultra Bullish Breakout: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


Here are the top three news stories over the past day presented to you by U.Today.KuCoin and its founders hit with criminal charges in U.S.The United States Department of Justice has filed criminal charges against crypto exchange KuCoin and two of its founders, Chun Gan and Ke Tang. As stated in the indictment, KuCoin and its founders violated the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program. "KuCoin and its founders deliberately sought to conceal the fact that substantial numbers of U.S. users were trading on KuCoin’s platform," stated U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, adding that the exchange allegedly chose not to comply with U.S. law. The allegations in the DOJ's indictment also indicated that the exchange actively prevented its U.S. customers from identifying themselves as such and misled investors about its customer base. To ensure user growth, KuCoin advertised itself as an exchange where one can trade without the need to undergo KYC. Thus, KuCoin's failure to maintain the required AML and KYC programs led to it being used as "a vehicle to launder large sums of criminal proceeds," says the indictment. Gan and Tang, who are both citizens of China, are facing up to 10 years in prison.Samson Mow makes bold Bitcoin ETF prediction for this week as BTC tops $70,000Jan3 CEO and "$1 billion per Bitcoin" advocate Samson Mow has recently taken to X platform to make a bullish prediction regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs for this week. As a reminder, spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the SEC in January, and from the very start of trading, ETFs have been grabbing enormous amounts of Bitcoin from the market. However, over the past few days, inflows into these ETFs experienced sharp outflows of more than $850 million worth of Bitcoin. Last week, Mow shared an optimistic X post, stating that he expects these Bitcoin ETF outflows to eventually become inflows again. Yesterday, Jan3 CEO reaffirmed his bullish stance, writing that he has a feeling that this week is going to be “a net inflow week,” adding a Bitcoin hashtag. Some commenters viewed this X post as being related to Bitcoin ETFs. At the moment of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at $69,242, down by 1.22% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.Shiba Inu braces for ultra bullish breakout: Is SHIB price rally imminent?Since the start of the week, Shiba Inu's price has witnessed a notable increase by over 4%, returning to the $0.00003 level. Analyzing the late February-early March rally, when SHIB prices surged by about 400%, breaking through the $0.3 per token threshold and reaching highs of $0.45 before experiencing a substantial fall, a pattern emerges. Every time SHIB got close to the $0.00003 mark, buyers appeared to step in, driving prices higher. However, every attempt to break through this barrier faced resistance, which led to sell-offs. At press time, SHIB is changing hands at $0.00002994, struggling to surpass the $0.3 resistance point. Despite this setback, the SHIB price's persistent growth trajectory and the resilience indicate that, should the $0.00003 barrier be decisively surpassed, there may be a possibility of a bullish breakout.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Trade Sideways as Crypto Market Cools Down - Decrypt

The cryptocurrency market witnessed a slight cool-down today, with the total market capitalization dropping 1.14% to $2.76 trillion according to Coingecko. This minor correction follows significant movements in the market over the past few days, as Bitcoin and Ethereum face resistance at key levels.Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency, has been attempting to break past the $70,000 barrier. However, this level has proven to be a strong resistance, with breakouts often followed by corrections that impact the broader crypto market. Today, Bitcoin experienced a 1.2% decline, with the coin reaching a daily high of $71,754 before correcting to $69,793. Despite the recent dip, Bitcoin's overall performance remains bullish, as it continues to recover from a flash crash on BitMEX that caused the price to plummet to $60,760.Image: TradingviewThe current daily candlestick suggests a possible correction, but the overall trend remains bullish.Bitcoin's price is trading above its EMA10, a positive sign for the coin because it signals that, at current prices, any investor that bought in the last 10 days should be in the green. With 97.7% BTC addresses being in the money according to data provided by IntoTheBlock, some short-term traders may be considering realizing their gains, while long-term hodlers may still be compelled to keep their tokens locked and see how markets behave. In terms of indicators, the recent market cooldown has brought balance to the markets. The relative strength index (RSI) stands slightly bullish at 58, indicating a well-balanced market compared to the 72 points registered on March 14, when Bitcoin was trading at a similar price. This may allow for safer bullish bets in strategies that take market sentiment into consideration.The average directional index (ADX) has dropped to 30 points, signaling that while the bullish mood persists, traders are more cautious, and upswings are not as extreme as in previous days. If Bitcoin fails to gain momentum, immediate support is found around $67,800, set by the EMA10. However, if bullish momentum continues, resistance is expected between the psychological $70K zone and the $73,794 all-time high.Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is exhibiting similar behavior to Bitcoin.The coin is currently trading at $6,543, having spiked to $3,663 before correcting to a minimum of $3,495 today. Overall, Ethereum is down 1.35% in the last 24 hours. The coin has faced strong resistance at $3,660 over the past three days, with the overall pattern showing more stability. This is not good for scalpers and day traders thinking about opening long positions.Image: TradingviewEthereum remains bullish, but the gap between the EMA10 and EMA55 is closing rapidly, which could indicate a price correction is still in play. The RSI has dropped to 52, suggesting that markets are currently indecisive, with no clear dominance from either bulls or bears.The ADX (which measures the strength of a trend) at 38. Combined with a squeeze momentum indicator—which guesses the phase of the market cycle an asset is being traded on—it shows bears are still not conceding to a price rebound. It also shows that traders may still be struggling to recover from the correction that began on March 12, which caused Ethereum's price to crash nearly 25% from $4,095 to $3,059.While both Bitcoin and Ethereum face resistance at key levels, their overall trends remain bullish. However, traders thinking about opening long positions on short timeframes must be cautious, as recent corrections are strong enough to stop the coins from continuing their path to price discovery zones once again.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

SingularityNet Confirms Groundbreaking AI Merger to ASI Token - DailyCoin


        
SingularityNet, Ocean Protocol, and Fetch.AI confirm to DailyCoin their merger.



The three AI industry leaders will establish the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance.



The Alliance aims to capitalize on the AI sector and the growth of the underlying three projects as a countermeasure against Big Tech.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) took the world by storm after it proved that it was more than just a buzzword but rather a tangible force shaping the very foundations of our current technological landscape. With projects such as ChatGPT, Dall-E, and more capturing the attention of industry giants like Microsoft and Google, the race to dominate the technology has intensified. In this fast-paced competition, decentralized entities like SingularityNet, Ocean Protocol, and Fetch.AI stand at the forefront, championing the cause of democratizing AI access for all.And what better way to do that than proposing a multi-billion dollar merger of their blockchain networks? The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI)In an official release shared with DailyCoin, SingularityNet confirmed that it is merging with leading AI protocols in the industry, Ocean Protocol and Fetch.AI, to create the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. The alliance, if approved by the respective communities, will culminate in the world’s largest open-sourced decentralized network via a $7.5 billion merger, accelerating the collaborators’ race to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).As part of the formation of the Alliance, Fetch.AI’s FET token, Ocean Protocol’s OCEAN token, and SingularityNet’s AGIX token will converge into a single $ASI token that will function across the combined decentralized AI network, providing unprecedented scale and power.



Expressing his views on the merger, Dr. Ben Goertzel, CEO and Founder of SingularityNet, shared with DailyCoin: “As the AI revolution intensifies it is imperative that AGI and ASI are not owned and controlled by any particular party with their own biased interests. They should be rolled out in an open, democratic, and decentralized way. This has been the joint vision of SNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol from their inception, and for this reason, it makes total sense that our three projects come together to form a tokenomic network that has greater power to take on Big Tech and shift the center of gravity of the AI world into the decentralized ecosystem.”According to the release shared with DailyCoin, the Alliance will be led by Ben Goertzel, Humayun Sheikh, Bruce Pon, and Trent McConaghy. The underlying entities will continue to operate as separate entities but will collaborate closely in the shared $ASI tokenomic ecosystem and the operation of the Alliance.ASI’s Vision: Capitalizing on the Rise of AIWith this merger, the Alliance looks to capitalize on the rise of AI and the growth of the underlying three projects as a protest against Big Tech’s control over AI development, use, and monetization.



The collab also aims to create a decentralized AI infrastructure that seeks to turn closed-source AI systems into open networks to coordinate machine intelligence toward shared objectives.When the proposal receives majority approval from the respective communities, the following will occur:
$FET becomes $ASI with a total supply of 2.63055 billion tokens and a starting price of $2.82



$AGIX tokens migrate to $ASI, at a conversion rate of 0.433350:1



$OCEAN tokens migrate to $ASI, at a conversion rate of 0.433226:1



$ASI will have a total FDV of $7.6 billion USD (combined value as of March 26, 2024)
Bruce Pon, Ocean Protocol CEO & Co-Founder, believes the combination can deliver on the promise of a vertically integrated stack of decentralized technologies with scale to compete globally. “The combination of our technologies creates a leader in R&D, applications, and commercialization of AGI,” Pon notes. “The unified ASI token is the glue to orchestrate all actors with common incentives. ASI tokens are used to secure the public network, as data access tokens and to unlock computation without needing traditional banking and payment rails. It is the native currency for the machine economy.”On the Flipside
OCEAN witnessed the biggest surge among the three tokens, gaining as much as 36% over the past 24 hours to trade at $1.49 as of press time following news of the merger. 



Tether Operations Limited also recently introduced its entry into AI.

Fidelity Investments filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday for a spot Ethereum ETF. What Happened: The S-1 filing, which includes staking capabilities, could be a significant development for Ethereum ETH/USD investors seeking a regulated way to gain exposure to the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. The development comes on the heels of the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. earlier this year. Fidelity was among the first 11 issuers to receive approval for a Bitcoin ETF, a decision that demonstrably boosted the overall digital asset market. The fund is the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC.The price of Bitcoin soared to new highs in March 2024, reaching a record-breaking $73,000. The arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 triggered a major shift in the digital asset landscape. As Bitcoin prices surged, many began to speculate on which cryptocurrency would be next.

FTX Creditors Likely To Be Paid up to 140% the Value of Their Original Claims: Report - The Daily Hodl


								FTX’s bankruptcy estate is primed to pay its creditors more than the value of their original claims, according to the Financial Times.
Citing two people “with knowledge of the restructuring negotiations,” FT reports that the imploded crypto exchange will likely pay its former customers 120-140% of the value of their holdings on the day FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022.










The increased payouts are thanks to soaring crypto prices and FTX’s 8% stake in the AI (artificial intelligence) safety and research company Anthropic. The bankrupt exchange’s administrators reportedly plan to sell two-thirds of that Anthropic stake to a group of investors for $884 million.
The size of creditor repayments hinges on whether the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) maintains its demand for $24 billion in unpaid taxes.
FTX’s legal team has also reportedly argued that the bankrupt crypto exchange owes no taxes to the IRS since it repeatedly recorded losses over its three-year lifespan.
Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty late last year of defrauding investors and mishandling billions of dollars worth of customer funds related to the multi-billion-dollar downfall of the exchange in 2022.
Prosecutors have recommended a prison sentence of 40-50 years for Bankman-Fried, although the former CEO’s lawyers have reportedly argued that he should serve a maximum of 6.5 years, pointing to the size of creditor repayments.

Bitcoin price falters as macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds mount

Bitcoin (BTC) price faced a moderate correction to $68,430 on March 27 after failing to break above the $71,000 mark. Data from Bitcoin derivatives data reveal a decline in bullish sentiment among professional traders over the past week, which could possibly indicate that the $69,000 level will not hold.Bitcoin spot ETF inflows will be decisive for BTC’s priceDespite a rally from $63,800 to $70,000 in the five days leading up to March 27, only $151 million in leveraged short positions were forcibly closed in the BTC futures markets. This suggests that bears remained cautious, even in light of last week's significant $888 million net withdrawal from U.S. Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).On a positive note, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience by recovering from a 17.6% drop from $73,757 on March 14 to $60,795 on March 20 without causing panic among spot ETF investors. However, some market observers argue that the primary driver behind BTC reaching a new high before the April Bitcoin halving was the unexpectedly high inflows into spot ETFs, highlighting the importance for bulls to monitor such trends.A positive for Bitcoin enthusiasts, this week saw a reversal in spot ETF flows, with a total of $418 million in net inflows recorded on March 26. Crucially, this was not due to reduced outflows from Grayscale's GBTC, indicating genuine institutional demand even as Bitcoin's price lingered just 4% below its peak. However, this does not assure professional traders that $69,000 will serve as a support level.Analysts can discern whether whales and arbitrage desks are adopting a bullish or bearish stance by analyzing aggregated positions across spot, perpetual, and quarterly futures contracts.Exchanges’ top traders BTC long-to-short ratio, 12 hours. Source: CoinglassOn Binance, the long-to-short ratio among professional traders was 1.50, favoring long positions on March 22, a figure that has slightly decreased to 1.42 currently. On OKX, the sentiment was much more bullish on March 22, with a long-to-short ratio of 3.22, a sentiment that has since diminished, with the ratio currently at 1.49 in favor of longs. This indicates a notable reduction in optimism among top traders, despite the 9.5% price increase during the period, suggesting other factors may be dampening bullish sentiment.Global economic concerns and mixed market signals impact Bitcoin price Some analysts argue that the global economic downturn is impacting Bitcoin's performance, particularly after the S&P 500 index could not maintain its all-time high of 5,320 achieved on March 21. The uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions for 2024 is causing investors to lose confidence; rate cuts are generally seen as positive for risk-on assets like Bitcoin. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, which reflects the expectations of the fixed-income markets, there's only an 8% chance of a rate cut at the Federal Reserve's May 1 meeting.Furthermore, analysts caution that a Fed rate cut may signal troubles rather than prosperity. Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, shared his concern over the lack of earnings growth posing the greatest risk to the stock market. He also highlighted worries about the overemphasis on artificial intelligence, which has significantly propelled the stock market's recent gains.Related: Massive Bitcoin consolidation sparks sell-side liquidity concernsData on Bitcoin's top traders indicates a decrease in the preference for leveraged long positions, differing from an increase in bears’ comfort. This shift may stem from simultaneous all-time highs in diverse asset classes, including gold, U.S. stocks, Bitcoin, Japan's Nikkei 225 index, and live cattle, suggesting market anticipation of a weaker U.S. dollar against scarce resources.The diminished interest in leveraged BTC longs should not alarm investors, nor a signal that Bitcoin will trade below $69,000, as it likely reflects broader economic recession concerns and external pressures, such as the U.S. Justice Department's charges against KuCoin exchange on March 26 and the European Parliament's committee discussions on limiting cryptocurrency payments from self-hosted wallets.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The collaborations of Polyhedra Network

Polyhedra Network, in collaboration with EigenLayer and Renzo, has emerged as a pioneering force, introducing innovative solutions that enhance interoperability, security, and economic participation among chains. 
At the forefront of this innovation is zkBridge, a revolutionary protocol that facilitates secure and decentralized transmission of messages across different blockchain networks. In the dynamic landscape of blockchain technology, interoperability and security are essential for the smooth operation of decentralized ecosystems.

The collaboration of Polyhedra Network
zkBridge by Polyhedra Network represents a significant step forward in the blockchain sector, offering a decentralized solution for bridging assets across Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. 
The collaboration with EigenLayer and the integration of the Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) ezETH by Renzo further strengthen the capabilities and security of the zkBridge ecosystem. This collaboration is supported by an impressive economic participation of 1.8 billion US dollars, ensuring a solid crypto-economic security.
Bitcoin, despite its importance in the cryptocurrency space, does not have a native smart contract functionality, which poses challenges for its integration into cross-chain ecosystems. 
However, zkBridge by Polyhedra Network, in collaboration with EigenLayer and Renzo, offers innovative solutions to securely connect Bitcoin to different blockchain networks. Integrating Bitcoin into zkBridge allows other blockchains to interact securely with Bitcoin, promoting low-trust interoperability.
Thanks to EigenLayer’s double-staking mechanism, zkBridge ensures the economic security of Bitcoin’s active validation services (AVS). Validators, equipped with both ZK tokens and Renzo’s ezETH, play a crucial role in ensuring the network’s integrity. In case of malicious activities, users can initiate zkBridge requests to correct discrepancies, safeguarding the network’s integrity and users’ assets.
The slashing mechanism built into Bitcoin AVS acts as a strong deterrent against fraudulent activities, ensuring the integrity of the network. Through careful monitoring and reporting, users contribute to the detection of harmful behaviors. In case of confirmation, the slashing protocol is executed, leading to the confiscation of stakes by dishonest validators. Furthermore, rewards are distributed to stakeholders and honest users, incentivizing active participation and promoting a robust ecosystem.
Fast purposes for Layer 2 networks
Layer 2 networks offer scalability and high transaction speed, but pose interoperability issues between chains. To solve this problem, zkBridge introduces a fast bridging solution that leverages an auxiliary validation network. 
This network attests the state of level 2 networks, ensuring fast finalization while maintaining security levels comparable to native blockchain executions. By simulating blockchain executions, zkBridge achieves fast finalization, significantly reducing transaction finalization time.
The integration of zkBridge with Layer 2 networks involves the verification of state proofs by auxiliary validation networks and the validation of Layer 1 consensus for Layer 2 transactions. Batch proofs are supported to reduce gas costs, improving efficiency and scalability. Through collaboration with EigenLayer, Polyhedra Network introduces dual staking on various blockchains, leveraging ZK tokens for economic security and ecosystem growth.

DePIN platform peaq secures $15M in pre-launch round

Update (March 27 at 17:58 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify that peaq is a layer-1 platform for DePINS, and Julia Pönitzsch is not a co-founder. Layer-1 platform peaq — focused on decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) — has disclosed a $15 million funding round ahead of its mainnet launch in May. The round was led by Generative Ventures and Borderless Capital, with participation from Spartan Group, HV Capital, CMCC Global, Animoca Brands, Moonrock Capital, Fundamental Labs, and other investors. Behind the peaq network is the Berlin-based startup EoT Labs, founded in 2017 by Leonard Dorlöchter, Max Thake, and Till Wendler. The peaq blockchain applies decentralization to physical infrastructure and systems, aiming to build an “Economy of Things” network. According to the company, its ecosystem is home to more than 20 DePIN projects — “already more than the likes of Solana, Polygon and other prominent layer-1s,” the company claimed in a statement to Cointelegraph. 


DePIN uses blockchain technology to incentivize people to build, own and run real-world physical infrastructure, thus distributing control across a network and avoiding centralization in any single organization’s hands. Initiatives in different industries are exploring DePIN use cases, such as energy systems for peer-to-peer energy trading, supply chains, telecommunications for internet access, and data storage for secure data management. Data from intelligence firm Messari indicates that the DePIN market valuation could reach $3.5 trillion in the next four years. The startup offers DePINs with Modular DePIN Functions, which are ready-to-use functions that allow DePINs to build and deploy their projects on the blockchain. Features available for projects include a machine tokenization platform and a DePIN Accelerator program. In 2021, peaq raised nearly $2.7 million in a seed round. The additional funds will be primarily allocated to its ecosystem expansion and further development of solutions for developers. “We will keep working on expanding the ecosystem, which will stand to benefit from more funds going into the Ecosystem Grant Program, and further developing the peaq SDK and the Modular DePIN Functions. All and all, this year is shaping up to be intense, growth-focused, and very promising, which is how we like it,” Leonard Dorlochter, co-founder of peaq, told Cointelegraph.Magazine: Inside Pink Drainer — Security analyst defends his crypto scam franchise

Asset Tokenization: A New Paradigm for Financial Infrastructure and Innovation

These examples and others, including tokenized gold, demonstrate how digital asset networks are used as the underlying digital infrastructure for distributing financial services. When viewed through this lens, we can consider what other value-add services could be delivered via digital asset infrastructure, instead of measuring the successes of these networks by the price of their native cryptocurrency.'An ideal outcome from the use of this technology would be for a faster, cheaper, more transparent and accessible financial system for all.'

This Altcoin Announces It Will Deposit Assets Into BlackRock's Cryptocurrency Fund - The Price Soars - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ondo (ONDO) announced that it will distribute a significant portion of its OUSG (Ondo Short-Term US Government Bonds) assets to the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL).
Following the development, there was a sudden increase in the price of the altcoin:










 
Until now, withdrawals from the OUSG fund have been restricted by traditional “+2 days post-trade” security closing periods, causing delays in investors getting their USD back after the sale of the underlying securities.


However, with the introduction of “+1 day after transaction day” for many types of securities, ONDO believes it has the opportunity to benefit from faster processing, one of the most important advantages of blockchain.
In response, ONDO announced that OUSG will soon offer instant investment and redemption, available 24/7/365.





Additionally, ONDO is introducing a new type of OUSG, the rUSG, with a fixed issue/redemption price of $1.00 per share. Yield will be distributed daily in the form of additional rUSG tokens via token reminting.

Why is the Price of Binance's Latest Launchpool Altcoin Soaring? Up Almost 50 Percent in One Day - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ether.fi, Binance's latest Launchpool project and a liquid restaking protocol, hit an all-time high today as the restaking craze continues to attract cryptocurrency investors.
The token, which represents the voting power in the decision-making process in the management of the protocol, rose by up to 50% to $ 7.2 in the last 24 hours.


This rise allowed ETHFI to recover from the price decline that followed its decline on March 18. After initially rising to $5 on Binance, the altcoin fell below $3 in the following days.
Liquid restaking protocols like Ether.Fi are designed to reuse Ethereum's proof-of-stake blockchain to secure other networks through the original restaking platform, EigenLayer.






According to the data, Ether.fi is the leader in the field of liquid restaking. Its total value locked (TVL) has jumped from $100 million to over $3 billion since the beginning of the year, according to DefiLlama data.
Ignas, a well-known DeFi analyst, noted that the strong price performance of the protocol's governance token, ETHFI, could boost the valuations of other liquid restaking tokens (LRT) to be released in the future. “The higher the ETHFI price, the higher the relative valuations of all other LRT governance tokens will be,” Ignas said.

Blast L2 hack prompts debate over centralization of Ethereum rollups


Yesterday’s $62 million hack of NFT-gaming project Munchables caused a stir amongst the crypto community, with calls for Blast’s core team to manually undo the damage on the centralized rollup.
Fortunately, such controversial action turned out to be unnecessary. Once it became clear that they were unable to get away with their ill-gotten gains, the rogue developer responsible for the theft returned the funds to the Blast team.

Read more: Crypto game exploited for $4.6M, hacker claims to be white-hat
As with The DAO hack on Ethereum in 2016, the incident forces us to consider the implications of interfering with what are supposed to be immutable ledgers.
The hack
Although the ‘hack’ itself was simple, it had been planned well in advance.
Before launch, a rogue developer used their admin access to assign themselves a hefty ether balance in a previous, unverified implementation of the Munchables contract.
Later, when deposits began to stream into the upgraded contracts, the exploiter’s address had plenty of ETH to drain the funds, withdrawing approximately 17,400 ETH, worth over $62 million at the time.
The developer also had admin access to a contract holding over $30 million in funds deposited by another Blast-based project, Juicebox. Centralization risk was identified as low severity in the project’s audit, and the developer’s preparations seemingly went unnoticed.
The culprit
Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT initially suspected that the developer responsible was part of the DPRK’s Lazarus Group of state-sponsored hackers, pointing the finger at a GitHub profile named ‘Werewolves0493.’

He also suggested that four of the project’s ‘developers’ may in fact be the same individual, as they were linked by on-chain transfers and through deposits to shared exchange addresses.
PixelCraft Studios’ CEO, who goes by coderdan.eth on X (formerly Twitter), shared his run-in with the same developer, who was fired “within a month.” Judging by deposits to their Binance addresses, ChainArgos believe the developer has had a handful of short-term jobs over the past 18 months.
Whether this individual was connected to Lazarus or not, attempting to infiltrate crypto teams is a known technique used by the hacking group.
The dilemma
Ever since the US Treasury’s sanctioning of crypto mixer Tornado Cash, credible censorship resistance has become an important measure of a blockchain’s decentralization. The hope is that if there’s no single entity to accuse of interacting with sanctioned addresses, then there’s nobody to prosecute. 
Likewise, though, if a US-based development team has sufficient admin powers to revert the effects of hacks or the actions of sanctioned entities, it may find itself obliged to do so. 
Precedents have been set in the past. Last year, Jump Crypto conducted a ‘counter-exploit’ to recover the 120,000 ETH lost in 2022’s Wormhole hack, worth over $300 million at the time.
Also in 2022, Binance-linked BNB Chain was halted by its validators, ensuring that the proceeds of a $600 million bridge hack couldn’t be siphoned to other, less censorable chains.
Blast itself isn’t exactly a prime example of crypto’s ‘trustlessness’ ethos, nor is it a paragon of decentralization.

Read more: Critics decry Blast as the latest sketchy scheme on Ethereum
When Blast was launched, alongside a FOMO-inducing points program, it offered ‘native yield’ on ETH and stablecoins, despite deposits simply going into a multisig wallet while the network itself was being built.
Blast’s status as a mostly experimental sandbox which doesn’t prioritize decentralization as much as other networks led some to believe that using centralized powers to manually revert unsavoury activities should be encouraged in order to make users whole.
But others argue that such a move could be seen as a sign of approval for other centralized rollups (e.g. Optimism and Base) that might be forced to censor their network activity.

The DAO
The debate brought back memories of 2016’s The DAO hack which, incidentally, involved a similar dollar amount lost (3.6M ETH, which would be worth almost $13B today).

Read more: Ethereum’s Dencun causes ‘Blast’ layer 2 outage 
The ‘hard fork’, designed to reverse the damage, resulted in a chain split leading to today’s Ethereum mainnet and the continuation of the pre-fork chain, now known as Ethereum Classic.
Given the frequency at which Ethereum users have been exposed to losses of $60 million and above since then, a hard fork to remedy a hack seems almost unthinkable.

Wealth Market Eyeing 3% Allocation to Bitcoin, Says Bitwise CIO - Benzinga

Following discussions with professional investors about their allocations to Bitcoin BTC/USD, "3% is the new 1%" according to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan. "I've been speaking with professional investors about bitcoin since 2018. For the past six years, the discussion has mostly focused on a 1% allocation. That's the most that most investors would think about" Hougan wrote on X. "Boy, has that changed. Almost every investor I've spoken with has talked about a 3%+ allocation." Hougan argued the newly-launched U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds were the primary reason for the shift, de-risking bitcoin's downside. "If ‘going to zero' is off the table, 3% or 5% starts to make more sense" he said. "True institutional investors (pensions, endowments, etc.) will still eye sub 1% allocations, but for the wealth market, 3%+ is the new new thing."Read the full story at The Block.© 2024 Benzinga.com.

KuCoin drops 17% in 24 hours amidst criminal allegations - AMBCrypto



U.S. prosecutors charge KuCoin with anti-money laundering violations and misleading investors.
CEO Johny Lyu addresses regulatory scrutiny, emphasizing that KuCoin is not an exception. 

In a significant development, U.S. Federal prosecutors have leveled charges against KuCoin [KCS], a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, and two of its founders for allegedly breaching anti-money laundering regulations. 
Amid mounting fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), CEO Johnny Lyu highlighted that regulatory scrutiny is common across the cryptocurrency industry. 
He noted, 
“The challenge we’re facing is not unique to KuCoin but rather typical growth and regulatory issues encountered by emerging industries.”
Lyu in defense of KuCoin 
The charges alleged that KuCoin operated within the United States misled investors about its U.S. operations, and neglected to register with relevant U.S. government bodies.
This happened while failing to uphold an anti-money laundering program.
Additionally, Lyu highlighted the inevitability of regulatory gaps in the early stages of an industry’s development, such as cryptocurrencies. He emphasized,
“Early-stage development often sees regulatory gaps, but as the industry matures, we move towards and embrace compliance and standardization.”
Rising optimism amidst upheaval 
All these have influenced the price pattern of Kucoin. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $12.02, marking a 17.08% decline within a single day. 
Despite the recent turmoil surrounding KuCoin, Ki Young Ju’s (the founder of CryptoQuant) insights provide an optimistic perspective. 
According to him, KuCoin appears to be functioning normally amid the panic, with on-chain data indicating increased Bitcoin and Ethereum withdrawals, primarily from retail investors. 
Moreover, there are no signs suggesting KuCoin mixes customer funds, and the exchange maintains adequate reserves to fulfill withdrawal requests. 
This perspective offers stability amidst the uncertainty surrounding the exchange, highlighting the resilience of the platform amidst regulatory challenges.

SafeDAO may finally vote to make SAFE tokens transferable - Blockworks


SafeDAO, the organization governing the smart wallet platform Safe, may soon vote on the possibility of making its SAFE token transferable.
SAFE tokens, introduced in 2022, are a form of digital assets designed for governance within the SafeDAO ecosystem. Over the past two years, recipients of these tokens have been able to use their allocations to vote on proposals that affect the development and operational decisions of the SafeDAO platform.
Initially, these tokens were non-transferable; they couldn’t be bought, sold or traded on any platform. This design choice was likely aimed at ensuring that only stakeholders with a long-term interest in the platform’s success could influence its direction, rather than speculative traders.
Read more: Solana welcomes Circle’s cross-chain transfer protocol
If enacted, the decision to make SAFE tokens transferable will mark a notable shift in SafeDAO’s strategy. Allowing transfers will increase liquidity, making it possible for people to buy and sell SAFE tokens, and will widen participation in governance by attracting a larger and more diverse group of token holders.
André Geest, the head of governance at Safe, told Blockworks that this newfound flexibility could allow the project’s DAO treasury to fund interesting projects within the ecosystem. It could also enable the organization to set up a rewards program and incentivize the usage of safe smart accounts.
“The token also plays a role in this future design space,” Geest said. “When you think about security abstraction, the token could play a role in curating registries. When it comes to payment abstraction, it could help facilitate fee transfers, for instance.”
Making sure tokens are safe
An initial vote to make SAFE tokens transferable in 2022 failed after some community members said, amid hundreds of forum replies, that SafeDAO should first more clearly define its mission and operations.
Geest explained that the 2022 vote hadn’t passed due to a combination of both internal and external factors.
“It was seen that the DAO was not mature enough, in the sense that it didn’t yet have a North Star. Also, one could say that the DAO didn’t have a market fit or a product fit,” Geest said. 
Additionally, following the collapse of FTX, many participants believed token transfers should be suspended until market conditions improved.
In response, a second proposal passed, outlining five milestones the DAO should meet before SAFE tokens would become transferable — ending the SAFE claim period, ratifying a constitution and then a governance framework, voting on how funds should be spent and deciding on the token’s utility. 
Read more: Safe social recovery eases private key management
Fifteen months later, SafeDAO has finally ticked off all five of the milestones, and a Snapshot vote is slated to go live that would make SAFE transferable. 
Luuk Weber, a SafeDAO delegate with experience in multiple DAOs dating back to 2019, called SafeDAO’s milestone system the “most structured approach I’ve seen in any DAO when it comes to aligning on operating logic prior to token transferability.”

“A lot of work has gone into these milestones from a lot of people, there was really heavy lifting from all parts, I think there’s genuinely a very positive sentiment to the progress that has been made, and the progress Safe has made with the product,” Geest said. 
Outside of the DAO, Safe has continued its development of smart accounts that make use of tools like account abstraction to let users create wallets with only an email. Worldcoin uses Safe to create wallets for its users inside of the World App.

Bitcoin Whale Moves 2,000 BTC Dormant for 14 Years


																An unknown individual or entity recently consolidated 2,000 BTC mined in 2010 into a single wallet.
This consolidation, noted by developer mononautical on X, occurred on March 26, involving the transfer of 40 sets of mining rewards, each consisting of 50 BTC, into one wallet.
Bitcoin Miner’s 14-Year Hold Pays Off
Reflecting on the situation, mononautical remarked, “Imagine holding for 14 years as the value rockets from a few hundred dollars to $140 million.” Notably, at the time of mining, the rewards amounted to $600.


Responding to the revelation, another X user, @Psifour, raised concerns about the possibility of compromised key generation, suggesting either a known pool or a random origin for the rewards.




However, mononautical clarified that the miner remains unidentified, suggesting the transfer may have been a strategic move rather than a security breach. “It’s possible the keys were compromised, but it seems like this went straight to an OTC desk,” mononautical added, citing a previous instance of similar old mining wallet sweeps.
This news follows another significant Bitcoin movement over the weekend. The fifth richest Bitcoin address, which had remained dormant since 2019, suddenly sprung to life. According to blockchain analytics firm Arkham, in 2019, this address was funded with 94,500 BTC worth $6.05 billion. The Bitcoin remained untouched until recently when it was divided and transferred to new addresses.
Bitcoin Faces Sell-Side Liquidity Crisis
Adding to the discourse, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju pointed out that the consolidation indicates a “sell-side liquidity crisis waking up old Bitcoin.” Ju also suggested that the transaction pattern indicates over-the-counter (OTC) sales of the funds.
Meanwhile, CryptoQuant’s latest “Weekly Crypto Report” outlined an upcoming “sell-side liquidity crisis.” The report attributed the crisis to a surge in Bitcoin demand, mainly fueled by the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. This heightened demand has drastically reduced the available supply for sale.
According to the report, Bitcoin’s liquid inventory has reached its lowest level ever in terms of months of demand, with current supply only sufficient to cover demand growth for twelve months.
It was also highlighted that when considering Bitcoin available strictly on U.S. exchanges, the supply would only be able to meet the demand for half as long, dropping to six months of demand if Bitcoin from exchanges outside the U.S. is excluded. This exclusion is based on the premise that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs will solely source Bitcoin from U.S. entities.

$7.5B AI crypto token merger scheduled for community voting on April 2

A token merger to the tune of $7.5 billion consisting of artificial intelligence (AI) protocols, SingularityNet, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol, is scheduled for a community vote of approval on April 2.According to the March 27 announcement, there will be three separate community votes for each individual protocol, with completion of all voting scheduled for April 16. If the union is approved, the Artificial Superintelligence Allia(ASI) token will replace the SingularityNet (AGIX), Fetch.ai (FET), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) tokens, respectively, with ASI having a fully diluted market cap of $7.5 billion across 2.631 billion tokens. The three tokens' current combined market cap is around $5.3 billion. "If approved, it will then be possible to swap $FET for Artificial Superintelligence token at a rate of 1:1," developers wrote. "For example, if you hold 100 $FET, you will be able to swap it for 100 $ASI." The FET token will be the reserve currency of ASI, while users will be able to convert OCEAN and AGIX into ASI at a new fixed rate.An additional 1.48 billion ASI tokens will be minted with 867 million ASI allocated to AGIX holders and 611 million ASI allocated to OCEAN token holders. Therefore, Singularity and Ocean token holders will "receive 0.433226 $ASI per $OCEAN and 0.433350 $ASI per $AGIX" as a result of the merger. As per Fetch.ai developers:"If you have $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens on an exchange, no action is needed. We will work with each exchange to ensure a smooth conversion and your holdings will automatically be converted to $ASI tokens directly by the exchange. You won’t see $OCEAN or $AGIX on the exchange — but don’t panic! Your tokens are there, just look for the $ASI symbol."In addition, the swap mechanism will be available indefinitely for OCEAN and AGIX users holding tokens on self-custody wallets to convert their balance. As announced the same day, the novel Superintelligence Alliance will share the common goal of developing blockchain-based decentralized AI protocols, which can't be controlled by centralized parties or large stakeholders.Related: Fetch.ai announces GPU rewards for tokenholders after $100M infrastructure investment

                        Solana meme coins continue to dominate the market, and in the latest move Mew Cat Coin (MEW) has exploded after going viral on X.This article will provide an analysis of MEW’s current price trends, and look to see whether the latest incarnation of Dogecoin, represents a more promising investment opportunity.Retail meme coin traders on X are jubilant, as the viral success of MEW’s explosive rally continues to hold strong across the social network – but can price explode to hit $1Bn market cap?MEW Price Analysis: Can The New Big Cat In Town Surge to Top Solana Meme Coin Status?
As price action consolidates at lower trendline support, Mew the Cat is currently trading at a market price of $0.00134 (representing a 24-hour change of -29.87%).This comes after MEW cat coin launched at just 6 AM (UTC) on March 26, in a listing that gained rapid traction due to sudden virality amongst Solana meme coin traders on X.MEW price increased aggressively, surging +15,500% across 7 hours of sustained upside moves, to hit an all-time high of $0.0037 at 12 PM on March 26.Yet, the dramatic move saw early backers amass huge gains, and a wave of profit-taking has swept into the chart in the hours since, with price tumbling -64% as a consequence.This has left an army of 9.19k holders fighting to establish consolidation above lower support at $0.001.However, with a whopping market cap of $118M, upside movements become tough from here on out – with a 10x move now contingent on an influx of over $900m in volume.For this reason, many retail investors are shifting their attention to the viral success of the Dogecoin20 presale – which would need 10x less volume to see a 10x price boom.DOGECOIN20 Hits Viral Success: Over $10M Raised as New Investors Race to Next Dogecoin Project
Dogecoin’s recent price gains have fuelled major interest in spin-off projects, and now investors are racing to take a position in a new crypto presale with over $10m raised so far for the next incarnation of the top DOGE.Viral success triggered Dogecoin20’s explosion above $10M raised, with the presale now heading for an imminent sell-out, so don’t miss the last window of opportunity to get in as an early-bird Dogecoin20.Dogecoin20 is the next-generation version of the top coin in the vertical Dogecoin (DOGE), and investor appetite has been fuelled by the chance to buy in at just 0.0001% of Dogecoin’s market cap.To put things in perspective, if DOGECOIN20 replicates just 1% of Dogecoin’s success, and hits a $192M market cap – investors could be sat atop a 50x return.Next Generation Meme Coins: With viral traction amongst new retail investors, Dogecoin20 is poised to revolutionize the meme coin vertical in the year ahead. With over $10m raised in its first 2 week of presale, this innovative token pays homage to the OG meme coin while setting the stage for a new generation of moon boys.Innovative Tokenomics: Dogecoin20 sets the stage for success in its tokenomics; it’s a powerhouse of innovation. Featuring a capped supply and an ingenious staking mechanism, this token rewards active participation and shields against inflation, setting a new standard for meme coins everywhere.Mission & Roadmap: Leading the charge into the 2024 bull run, Dogecoin20 champions the idea of “Do Only Good Everyday.” With a roadmap focused on charity, community support, and real-world impact, this project aims to redefine the crypto landscape and pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future.Join the Revolution: Be part of something special.

After Months, Another Bitcoin Spot ETF Launched in the US - This One Is Different from the Others - Bitcoin Sistemi


The United States added one more spot Bitcoin ETF, bringing the total to eleven ETFs. This comes more than two months after the launch of the top ten spot BTC ETFs.
The latest addition to the list is asset manager Hashdex's Bitcoin Futures ETF, which has been trading on the New York Stock Exchange since 2022 as a futures-based fund under the ticker DEFI. The fund has now been renamed and converted to Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, which operates as a spot Bitcoin fund.


Hashdex announced in a press release that unlike other spot Bitcoin ETFs, DEFI can hold up to 5% of the fund's assets in BTC futures contracts traded on CME. According to the statement, this futures allocation will enable DEFI to more accurately track the BTC price over time and provide a more predictable fund creation/redemption process.

This approach is not new for ETFs. In fact, most S&P 500 ETFs use a similar strategy, according to the company. DEFI currently holds 5,500 BTC and a modest number of futures contracts. At 0.90%, the fund's expense ratio is lower than Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC) 1.50%, but higher than the other nine spot products.

SEC Lawsuit Against Coinbase Moves Forward-How Bad Is It? - Decrypt

A federal judge overseeing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) sweeping lawsuit against Coinbase ruled Wednesday that the regulator’s arguments against the crypto exchange are largely “plausible,” permitting the case to proceed and denying Coinbase’s motion to dismiss it in its entirety.Rulings on motions to dismiss, such as today’s, are not resolutions of factual disputes. When evaluating such motions, federal judges only dismiss a case if there is not plausible evidence that a law has been violated, even when assuming all facts alleged by a plaintiff to be true.In today’s ruling, however, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Failla not only found most of the SEC’s claims against Coinbase fit for trial, but also indicated support for the agency’s broader, long standing argument about crypto: Many tokenized assets constitute securities schemes, and fall under the SEC’s purview.“The ‘crypto’ nomenclature may be of recent vintage, but the challenged transactions fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years,” Judge Failla wrote.On two major claims, Judge Failla allowed the SEC’s case against Coinbase to proceed: that Coinbase operates as an unregistered securities exchange for retail and institutional investors, and that its crypto staking programs constitute additional offerings of unregistered securities.A third claim against Coinbase, however—that via the Coinbase Wallet, the company conducts brokerage activity—was dismissed by Judge Failla. The logic relied on by Failla to dismiss the claim was specific only to the legal definition of a brokerage and does little to aid Coinbase’s remaining case against the SEC.On Twitter, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wrote that he was not surprised by today’s ruling.https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1772993916146479193“We were prepared for this,” Grewal said. “Early motions like ours against a government agency are almost always denied. But clarity is the ultimate goal and today’s decision continues us on that path.”The SEC’s case against Coinbase now proceeds to discovery. Judge Failla has instructed both parties to submit proposed case management plans by April 19.When Coinbase argued the merits of its motion to dismiss the case in January, Failla appeared intrigued by arguments made by crypto industry advocates.But her ruling today may have indicated not just trouble ahead for Coinbase, but for the crypto industry’s broader, ongoing battle against federal regulators.Buried within Judge Failla’s 84-page judgment was a rejection of Coinbase’s claim that the SEC has violated federal law by failing to disclose its crypto policy. Earlier this week, the DeFi Education Fund sued the SEC on similar grounds.“The SEC is not announcing a new regulatory policy,” Judge Failla wrote today, dismissing such arguments. “But rather is simply engaging in a fact-intensive application of an existing standard—an application that Coinbase also conducted—to determine whether certain transactions involving crypto-assets meet the characteristics of an ‘investment contract.’”Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Altcoins Are “Heavily Undervalued,” - Renowned Crypto Analyst


							

Michaël van de Poppe thinks altcoins are still “heavily undervalued.”



Poppe believes an upcoming Bitcoin correction will lead to an altcoin rally.



According to Poppe, the expected Fed interest rate decision will impact the market in the medium term.




Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe thinks altcoins are still “heavily undervalued.” In a recent post on X, Poppe noted that altcoins are slowly moving upward. He cited Chainlink (LINK) as one of the altcoins experiencing significant strength. However, he believes the altcoin season has yet to begin fully.







Poppe’s post on X referenced one of his recently uploaded YouTube videos, where he analyzed the altcoin market, highlighting the current pre-halving trend. The analyst compared the current altcoin market to the situation before the 2016 Bitcoin halving.



According to Poppe, although Bitcoin did not reach a new all-time high (ATH) before the 2016 halving event, the trend of that cycle remains similar to the current price development. He noted a significant impulsive Bitcoin move pre-halving, resulting in a relatable correction. 



Meanwhile, the renowned analyst believes there is still a chance for a pre-halving correction following the current Bitcoin rally. He thinks the expected correction will enable altcoins to perform significantly well. However, Poppe cited the anticipated macroeconomic data expected soon from the U.S. Federal Reserve to impact the crypto market.



In further explanation, Poppe noted that he does not expect the Fed to cut down on interest rates. He thinks that would trigger the market to drop before making its way back up. In his opinion, not cutting down on interest rates would be positive for the market in the medium term.



Poppe noted that the crypto total market cap is closing up on the ATH. He thinks after the recent surge, the wholesale metric would experience some consolidation before continuing upwards. However, the analyst acknowledged the role of Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto ecosystem. He thinks it is nearing a pre-halving peak that would trigger a capital rotation to the benefit of altcoins.

Roger Ver would support Bitcoin again if this happens


Roger Ver was one of the most vocal and important figures for Bitcoin’s (BTC) worldwide adoption in the early days.
The well-known investor and entrepreneur appeared in an interview on the Bitcoin Takeover Podcast on March 27. Among different topics, Roger Ver discussed with Vlad Costa about Ross Ulbricht’s 40th birthday, his thoughts on cryptocurrencies, and what would take Ver to vocally support Bitcoin again.
In particular, he explains that he would need to see Bitcoin being able to provide more economic freedom to the world. However, Roger Ver does not think this has been the case for the past seven years.



“As soon as I see BTC as a product that could have a chance to provide more economic freedom to the world, I would be right back there, in a moment. But, at the moment, I see projects like Monero, Zano, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and things like that having a much much bigger potential impact in freedom for the world.”
– Roger Ver

Moreover, Roger Ver explained that the cryptocurrency world has seen a move from BTC to Monero (XMR) in the darknet. This, according to him, was due to Monero’s privacy features, which help to “bring more economic freedom to the world,” in Ver’s words.

Roger Ver’s new book: Hijacking Bitcoin
The once known as “Bitcoin Jesus” has stepped away from supporting the most capitalized version of Bitcoin, BTC, in 2017. Roger Ver was, back then, one of the main supporters of the alternative, Bitcoin Cash (BCH). BCH aims to be an efficient medium of exchange, besides being a solid store of value, as the narrative behind what we currently know as Bitcoin.

“Whatever people can use as a medium of exchange is also what they want to use as their store of value.”
– Roger Ver

Interestingly, Roger Ver talked about a new book he is launching with Steve Patterson, now in pre-order on Amazon. The book is called “Hijacking Bitcoin: The Hidden History of BTC” and has already made the first place for new releases in “General Technology & Reference.” It is also possible to pay for the book using BCH.
On the notes about “Hijacking Bitcoin,” he comments:

“There is history that needs to be told. For the most part, the histories are told by the victors. The big block side, until now, has lost in terms of the Bitcoin-scaling war, but I think it’s really important for both sides to be heard. And one side engaged in a bunch of censorship and dirty and immoral tactics that are outlined in the book.”
– Roger Ver

Is Bitcoin priced by the free market?
In the discussion between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, the known freedom enthusiast slams external interference on the BTC price.
First, he says that “the free market is never done speaking,” about Bitcoin having a larger value than the alternatives. Second, he explains how, so far, there is no real “free market” dynamics in play to price Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

“It is not a free market at all. Not even remotely close. You have all these bureaucrats and politicians all over the world setting rules for this, and rules for that. BTC is allowed to have an ETF today, maybe Ethereum will next week, and Ripple is in trouble with the SEC, Bitcoin Cash is in limbo, Monero is not allowed to be listed on exchanges in half the countries around the world because it is too private. We are not even remotely close to a free market.”
– Roger Ver

In this context, Roger Ver had also said he believed the cryptocurrency market would have a lot more relevance and value today if Bitcoin had performed well as a medium of exchange.
All in all, the interview lasted for nearly one and a half hours. It was one of the longest interviews with Roger Ver in the past few years. Moving forward, the market could now expect to hear more from the “Bitcoin Jesus.”

RWA Platform Ondo Finance Will Use BlackRock's Ethereum-Based BUIDL Fund to Back Its T-Bill Token OUSG

Ondo's action marks the first example of a crypto protocol leveraging asset management giant BlackRock's tokenized fund offering, which debuted last week. The fund, represented by the Ethereum-based BUIDL token backed by U.S. Treasury bills and repo agreements, is targeted for white-listed, institutional clients and requires at least $5 million minimum allocation. While the strict requirements prohibits smaller investors to invest in BlackRock's BUIDL, it allows other platforms such as Ondo to leverage the fund for its own retail-facing offerings.

Ethereum ETF Delays as US Lawmakers Demand Clarity from SEC - DailyCoin


        
Congress demands clarity on Ethereum’s status after ETF approvals stall.



ETF decision delays prompt calls for definitive crypto regulations.



SEC asked to provide comprehensive guidance on crypto assets. 
In the crypto ecosystem, Ethereum is a key player and the biggest platform for DeFi and decentralized applications. However, its regulatory status remains uncertain, especially as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deliberates on approving ETH-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).Recent developments have seen a group of US lawmakers stepping into the fray, seeking clarity from the SEC regarding Ethereum’s classification and the broader regulatory definitions affecting digital assets.Lawmakers Demand SEC ClarityOn Tuesday, March 26, a group of Republican lawmakers, led by prominent figures in the House Financial Services Committee and House Committee on Agriculture, wrote a letter to the SEC, asking for clarity on digital assets, specifically Ethereum. The letter, signed by 48 lawmakers, directly responds to Prometheum Capital, which will offer custody services for ETH to institutional clients later this month. Lawmakers inquired whether Special Purpose Broker-Dealers (SPBD) can have custody over non-security digital assets like Ethereum.Lawmakers remarked that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC have a record of classifying Ethereum as not a security. However, they also stated that the SEC has hesitated to classify ETH, which has led to heightened uncertainty expressly.The letter also delves into the broader implications of the SEC’s regulatory approach. It emphasizes the potential negative effects on the digital asset markets. A lack of clear guidelines and consistent regulatory policy could impact Ethereum’s derivatives market and influence the broader digital asset landscape. 



The SEC’s wavering is already impacting several major institutions that have filed applications for Ethereum ETFs. SEC’s Postpones Decision on Ethereum ETFsThe SEC has recently postponed its decision on the applications for Ether (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) from major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. These delays come despite previous approvals for Bitcoin-based ETFs. Final deadlines for these decisions have been extended to May 2024, reflecting the SEC’s ongoing evaluation process and its call for public comments on these ETF applications. Moreover, recent reports revealed that the SEC is looking to classify Ethereum as a security, a move that would most likely block Ethereum ETFs. 



This postponement of the decision and the latest investigations have raised doubts among traders about the approval of Ethereum ETFs. A Bloomberg analysis put the approval odds at just 25% due to the SEC’s lack of engagement with the process. On the Flipside
Despite the calls for a new framework on digital assets, the SEC has maintained that current regulation is enough. 



SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has been a vocal critic of the agency’s approach to digital assets, spearheading the call for regulatory clarity. 
Why This MattersEthereum’s role as a foundational platform for DeFi, NFTs, and other decentralized applications makes its regulatory classification a pivotal issue for stakeholders in the crypto space.Read more about Ethereum ETF’s winning approval by the SEC: Ethereum ETF Approval Odds Dim to 25% Due to SEC’s InactionRead more about Tether’s big AI play: Tether Bets Big on AI: Can Blockchain Take on Big Tech?

AMC forgot about NFTs


There was a brief period where the movie theater and gold mining conglomerate AMC participated in the then-trendy NFT market, releasing several different collections tied in with various movies or the concept of stock ownership.
Twelve collections were initially released over 306 days, however, it’s been 527 days since the last one listed on the AMC website’s NFT page was released.
Back in this heady era, AMC proudly mentioned NFTs in its financial filings, and even claimed that it would “continue to implement innovative NFT offers to further engage and build loyalty with our guests.” 
The first NFT launch — a tie-in with Spider-Man – No Way Home — reportedly crashed both AMC and Fandango’s websites and led to chief exec Adam Aron to state that the “Spider-Man NFT is a key reason why No Way Home generated the second highest one-day ticket sales in AMC’s entire history.” 

However, it wasn’t mentioned in the next quarter’s filing and hasn’t been mentioned in quarterly filings since. 
The NFTs still exist and are still traded, albeit with varying degrees of value. Someone purchased several of the Spider-Man NFTs several weeks ago, and they were willing to pay almost $20 for each of them. Yesterday, someone also paid $10 for a Batman NFT but most collections are less liquid and traded than these.
AMC’s most recent financial statements warn that its “cash burn rates are not sustainable long-term.”
We have reached out to AMC to see if it intends to issue any new NFTs in the near future and will update this piece if we hear back.

SEC Asks Judge To Order Ripple To Pay Nearly $2,000,000,000 in Fines and Penalties - The Daily Hodl


								The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked a judge to order Ripple to pay nearly $2 billion in fines and penalties.
The SEC first sued the payments company in late 2020 for allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security.










Last summer, US District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s automated, open-market sales of XRP, referred to as programmatic sales, did not constitute security offerings, contrary to what the SEC alleged.
The judge did, however, side with the SEC’s claim that Ripple’s sale of XRP directly to institutional buyers constituted a securities offering.
James K. Filan, a defense lawyer and crypto legal expert, shared the SEC’s new Motion for Remedies and Entry of Final Judgment, which was submitted to the court on Monday.
The SEC has asked the court to order Ripple to pay $876,308,712 in disgorgement, $198,150,940 in prejudgment interest, and a $876,308,712 civil penalty, which totals around $1.95 billion.
Argues the regulator,
“Ripple’s years-long, nearly $1 billion, course of violations of the securities laws alone warrants injunctions, significant penalties, and the disgorging of Ripple’s profits. Additional evidence shows the egregiousness of Ripple’s misconduct, highlighting the importance of this relief for deterrence and to ensure Ripple ceases its illegal conduct.”
Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, accuses the SEC of trading in “statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead.”
“Rather than faithfully apply the law, the SEC remains bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple – and the industry at large. We trust the Court will approach the remedies phase fairly.”

SEC vs. Ripple Resolution Nears: Is $2B Fine the Final Stroke? - DailyCoin


        
Ripple will face a potential $2 billion fine if the SEC succeeds in classifying XRP as a security.



Both parties could still choose to settle, avoiding a definitive ruling on XRP’s status.



The court has not yet determined the verdict, and the final judgment could be significantly different.
The long-running legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs appears to be nearing its conclusion. The case concerns whether XRP, Ripple’s native token, constitutes an unregistered security. SEC Seeks $2 Billion from RippleThe SEC levied charges against Ripple in December 2020, alleging the company raised over $1.3 Billion through the unregistered sale of XRP tokens. A recent filing by the SEC in the remedies stage seeking disgorgement of $876 Million, which they believe represents Ripple’s net profits from the unregistered sales along with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty, brings the total requested in remedies to nearly $2 Billion.Ripple maintains that XRP is a utility token and not a security, and therefore, it is exempt from SEC registration. They argue that their sales to institutional investors caused no harm and that the SEC’s accusations stifle innovation in cryptocurrency. Ripple’s CLO has stated that their response to the SEC’s filing will be submitted next month and has asserted that the SEC’s statements are false, mischaracterized, and designed to mislead.What’s at Stake?For Ripple, a loss in court could have significant repercussions. A hefty fine would undoubtedly impact their finances, but more importantly, a ruling classifying XRP as a security would subject Ripple to stricter regulations and potentially hinder XRP’s adoption and use case.



While a resolution appears imminent, the final ruling and any imposed penalties remain to be seen. The court could decide in favor of either party or even settle. Here are some possibilities:
Ripple Wins: If the court favors Ripple, it would be a significant blow to the SEC’s efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry.



SEC Wins: A win for the SEC would establish a precedent for future enforcement actions against ICOs and token sales. The $2 Billion fine could be imposed, though the final amount may be less.



Settlement: Both parties could reach a settlement agreement, potentially involving a financial penalty but avoiding a definitive classification of XRP as a security.
The $2 billion figure being circulated represents the SEC’s claim, not a predetermined penalty by the court. The verdict is yet to be determined, and the final judgment could be significantly less or even entirely removed, depending on the court’s decision. On the Flipside
Even with a court decision, a lengthy appeals process could delay any final resolution for Ripple and the crypto industry.



The $2 billion fine isn’t the final judgment for Ripple; they still need to file their response, and the judge will make the final decision.



XRP community members argue that the SEC’s $2B damages claim appears excessive, considering Ripple’s $15B market cap loss at the time of the lawsuit’s filing. They assert the SEC should be accountable for investors’ losses due to its approach.
Why This MattersThis lawsuit sets a potential precedent for how the SEC regulates cryptocurrency tokens. A clear ruling will impact Ripple, XRP, and other companies dealing with token sales, influencing how they structure their offerings and potentially affecting the overall adoption of cryptocurrencies.

KuCoin Moves 2T SHIB in Strange Move as the Law Closes in - DailyCoin


        
KuCoin saw massive outflows yesterday as holders panic over DoJ charges.



Co-founders face allegations from the United States Department of Justice.



On Wednesday, SHIB reclaimed $0.00003, hovering around $18bn market cap.
The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) sent ripples through the cryptosphere yesterday, slapping KuCoin, one of the globe’s leading crypto exchanges, with serious criminal charges for alleged money laundering.Here’s What Set Off the Swirl of Huge WithdrawalsIn an official statement by the DoJ on March 26, 2024, two of KuCoin’s co-founders are accused of conspiring to violate the Bank Secrecy Act by “willfully failing to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program,” which is aimed to prevent the exchange from being used for money laundering and terrorism financing.Naturally, the legal scrutiny has caused panic among KuCoin’s users, who rushed to withdraw their assets. Crypto whales have been spotted relocating tens of millions in popular stablecoins like Tether USD (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) to competing crypto exchanges like Bybit and OKX.Following the accelerated outflows on KuCoin, blockchain analytics firm LookOnChain spotted a 32 million USDT deposit to Bybit on Wednesday morning. According to the reserve statistics, KuCoin now holds approximately $6.137B in digital assets, including over $1bn of Bitcoin (BTC) and 3.37T, or $104.95 million of the popular Japanese guard dog-embossed Shiba Inu (SHIB).2T SHIB Leaves KuCoin Amid Mounting Legal TroublesAmong a flurry of hefty whale transactions, a gargantuan 2 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) transfer was seen by Whale Alert. The 2T SHIB transfer immediately raised eyebrows in X, as cryptocurrency traders witnessed a $62,232,000 SHIB transfer on-chain.Surprisingly, this transaction wasn’t attributed to cryptocurrency whales relocating their crypto stashes due to fear and uncertainty. On the contrary, the cryptocurrency address is tied to KuCoin’s platform, as it’s labeled ‘KuCoin 20’ on EtherScan blockchain explorer.



Further investigation by DailyCoin showed that Shiba Inu is the second largest asset in the ‘KuCoin 20’ account. Worth $63,109,626 at the time of publication, the only larger crypto assets in this hot wallet are over $100 million of KuCoin’s KCS token.On the Flipside
The 2T Shiba Inu transfer amounts to up to 59% of KuCoin’s total 3.37T SHIB reserves.



Most cryptocurrency exchanges tend to shift massive amounts of reserves for maintenance.
Why This MattersKuCoin is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, with nearly 10 million monthly visitors. The criminal charges against the platform’s co-founders resembled last year’s, when the DoJ fined Binance $4.3 billion for similar offenses.Read DailyCoin’s trending crypto stories:

Bitcoin evangelist and financial journalist Max Keiser has commented on the recent news of the court rejecting Coinbase’s request to drop the SEC suit against them. The only achievement of the exchange’s legal team here is that the court agreed to exclude the Coinbase Wallet from the list of subjects of the SEC’s lawsuit. Keiser supports SEC against Coinbase and altcoinsKeiser tweeted that “SEC is right”, again reminding his army of followers that all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin, are “unregistered securities”, including XRP and ETH.SEC is correct. Anything not #Bitcoin is an unregistered security, including ETH & XRPCoinbase was slammed with a legal action by the SEC in the summer last year for allegedly allowing users to trade unregistered securities. For the Securities and Exchange Commission all altcoins are considered securities and only Bitcoin and Ethereum have been proclaimed commodities. However, recently discussions again began rising inside the SEC about whether the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum is a commodity indeed. All Bitcoin maximalists, including Max Keiser and Samson Mow, believe ETH to be a security, a heavily centralized crypto.As for XRP, the case of the SEC against Ripple about this coin has been going since December 2020. Last year, Ripple scored a major victory in mid-summer, when the federal judge ruled that XRP sales on the secondary markets do not qualify as securities sales. The regulator also dropped charges against Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen and the company’s chief executive Brad Garlinghouse.In the latest, development, the SEC demands that Ripple pays $2 billion in remedies to them to cover all the fines and damages caused.

Ripple Legal Saga: Pro-XRP Lawyer Challenges SEC Allegations, Raises Validity Concerns - Coin Edition


							

Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan questions SEC’s allegations, citing lack of evidence and validity.



SEC claims Ripple’s discounts caused $480 million in harm to investors, stirring legal tensions.



Concerns mount over Ripple’s reputation and compliance amidst regulatory scrutiny and legal battles.




In the ongoing legal saga between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Pro-XRP lawyer, Bill Morgan, has stepped forward to provide insights into the potential impact of the regulatory body’s recent allegations. As tensions continue to rise, Morgan’s analysis sheds light on the challenges Ripple faces through legal scrutiny.







Morgan’s comments revolve around the SEC’s accusations aimed at Ripple, particularly concerning the crypto firm’s ‘alleged’ preferential treatment towards institutional investors.



Source: Bill Morgan



The SEC’s latest brief alleges that such preferential discounts given by Ripple could have resulted in harm amounting to a staggering $480 million for investors left out of these arrangements. 



Morgan has expressed reservations about the stance taken by the SEC. He believes that it is necessary to scrutinize the evidence behind the allegations and questions the validity of the SEC’s assertions. He highlights the apparent lack of evidence regarding the causation of the alleged wrongdoing. 



Morgan is also concerned about the potential damage to Ripple’s reputation among institutional investors. The revelation of selective discounts raises questions about the company’s compliance with regulatory standards, particularly regarding disclosure requirements. Such issues could further complicate Ripple’s legal proceedings and erode investor trust in the company.



The SEC has escalated its efforts by appealing to Judge Torres for a final judgment against Ripple. The regulatory agency is seeking a range of punitive measures, including permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties totaling nearly $2 billion.

Samsung tops Apple in AI smartphone race with Galaxy AI updates

Samsung’s free-for-now AI smartphone features will get an update on Thursday, putting the South Korean electronics giant even further ahead of Apple in the race to bring generative AI to cell phones.Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?Samsung first launched Galaxy AI on its Galaxy S24 smartphone in January. The AI software (which leverages Google’s AI chatbot Gemini) offers live translation when users make phone calls, so they can select the language they’re speaking and the language they want their voice to be translated to in real time. There’s also AI photo editing capabilities and “circle to search,” which lets people quickly look up information about an element within a picture. Now the AI features, which come at no cost until 2025, will be available on more Samsung phones — the S23 series, S23 FE, Z Flip 5, and Z Fold 5.Google was the first to debut a smartphone with AI tools with the Pixel 8 Pro in December. But Apple has yet to release an iPhone powered by AI features. The tech giant is reportedly in talks with Google parent Alphabet to use Gemini for iPhones, and it’s also considered leveraging OpenAI’s model. Apple also quietly acquired the Canadian startup DarwinAI earlier this year as it prepares to launch iOS 18 (probably in September) with generative AI features.Apple’s AI push comes as it’s falling behind in the smartphone market. iPhone sales fell 24% year-over-year in China to start 2024.Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan noted  the muted sentiment for Apple during a recent visit to China to meet with supply chain company executives. “This is the first trip over approximately 20 years we have been doing this where smartphones were barely a part of the conversation,” Mohan wrote in an email to investors Wednesday.Apple is facing other challenges, too. The company is being sued by the Department of Justice for allegedly violating antitrust law, and it’s getting investigated by the European Union over similar concerns about allegedly anticompetitive practices. Not to mention the company shuttering its electric vehicle project and its stock underperforming other tech giants in the so-called Magnificent Seven. It’s safe to say Apple has had a rough 2024 so far. A push into AI could give it a boost.

Bitcoin Miner Sued Over Pollution Despite Cleanup Claim - DailyCoin


        
A Pennsylvanian community group sues Bitcoin miner Stronghold Digital Mining.



The community group alleges environmental damage caused by the mining process.



Stronghold claims its activities are helping the local environment. 
The environmental toll of Bitcoin mining continues to be a flashpoint, with critics denouncing the crypto industry’s intensive use of fossil fuels and wasteful draw on electricity supply. This debate is playing out in Pennsylvania, where a community group called Save Carbon County has sued Bitcoin miner Stronghold Digital Mining over claims the firm is polluting the local environment. Yet, Stronghold insists its operations are cleaning up the local area.Bitcoin Miner Stronghold Digital in Legal Hot WaterIn a blow to Bitcoin mining, Save Carbon County has filed a lawsuit against Stronghold Digital, alleging the company’s mining operation is polluting nearby communities by burning waste coal and old tires to power the energy-intensive mining process and releasing mercury into the local waterways.The community group is seeking compensation and punitive damages from the company, as well as a court order to stop the alleged pollution.The lawsuit also names Pennsylvania as a defendant, along with related entities, including the state governor, Josh Shapiro, on the basis that the co-defendants are complicit in violating the state’s constitutional duty to protect the environment by enabling Stronghold Digital’s activities through issued permits and tax incentives.Stronghold Digital stated that its facilities clean up land and water using coal waste from historic mining in the region. The company claimed to have reclaimed over 1,050 acres of formerly blighted land.



This latest case has reignited the debate on Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact. Still, industry groups including the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) argue that proof-of-work mining creates an inconsequential impact.BTC Mining Has Minimal Environmental ImpactThe BMC continues to contend that Bitcoin mining is not as environmentally damaging as critics claim. In its latest report for the first half of 2023, the council stated that the Bitcoin network is using 59.9% sustainable energy sources, up from 58.9% in the previous period covering Q4 2022.On the matter of wasteful electricity usage, the BMC claimed the Bitcoin network used just 0.21% of global energy in the first half of 2023, a slight increase from 0.17% in Q4 2022. The council argued that this demonstrates Bitcoin’s minimal burden on worldwide power grids.



The BMC consists of independent Bitcoin miners who voluntarily share their operational data to increase transparency in the mining industry. The organization aims to educate the public on the benefits of BTC mining.On the Flipside
The BMC‘s membership represents a fraction of global miners, meaning its data may be unrepresentative.



Proponents of energy-intensive proof-of-work mining claim it is superior to proof-of-stake as it is more decentralized, and more secure due to the prohibitive cost of attacking a proof-of-work system.
Why This MattersWhile crypto proponents may tout economic opportunities as a result of Bitcoin mining, this case lays bare the tension between those financial incentives and environmental costs. A ruling favoring the community group could encourage more challenges against miners operating in residential areas and spur tighter regulations around emissions and energy sources.The Biden administration pushes energy tax to curb Bitcoin mining activity.

Is KuCoin The Next FTX? CryptoQuant's CEO Has The Answer


								On Tuesday, the US Department of Justice announced criminal charges against the global crypto exchange KuCoin and two of its founders, Chun Gan (also known as “Michael”) and Ke Tang (also known as “Eric”). The charges, related to conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, have stirred concerns among users and investors about the future of the Seychelles-based exchange, echoing fears reminiscent of the FTX collapse.
Is KuCoin The Next FTX?
According to the official press release by the Southern District of New York, the indictment accuses KuCoin and its founders of deliberately failing to implement an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program. This negligence allegedly facilitated the use of the platform for money laundering and terrorist financing activities.
Moreover, the exchange is accused of not maintaining necessary procedures to verify customer identities and failing to report any suspicious activities.

Despite these serious allegations, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju provided a contrasting view, focusing on the exchange’s operational and financial stability. Through a statement on X, Ju highlighted that, from an on-chain perspective, KuCoin’s Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) reserves seem unaffected by the surge in withdrawals, primarily by retail users.
Ju remarked, “On-chain wise, Kucoin is fine. BTC and ETH withdrawals surged, driven mainly by retail users, with a small impact on the overall reserve. They appear to not commingle customers’ funds and have sufficient reserves to process user withdrawals.”

This reassurance comes at a crucial time when the memory of FTX’s downfall, triggered by liquidity issues and allegations of misusing customer funds, still lingers in the minds of the crypto community. Ju made a clear distinction between the reserve management practices of KuCoin and FTX, underscoring the organic nature of KuCoin’s BTC and ETH reserves in contrast to the problematic handling of funds by FTX.
“Kucoin’s BTC and ETH reserves appear organic, unlike those of FTX. They don’t commingle customers’ funds,” Ju stated and shared the Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange reserves charts by CryptoQuant.

Ju contrasted these charts with the one’s from FTX, noting “Here are FTX reserves for comparison. FTX commingled customers’ funds with their funds; you can see a lot of bulk deposits/withdrawals in the charts. It doesn’t look organic.”

As of now, KuCoin hold 5.949 BTC and 99.358 ETH, according to CryptoQuant’s data. The total balance of KuCoin’s portfolio across multiple chains is valued at $4.764 billion, according to Scopescan data.
At press time, the KuCoin token (KCS) traded at $11.42, down -20% since the news broke.

AltLayer Launches ALT Staking - The Defiant

Rollup provider aims to provide fast finality with its MACH Alpha product built atop EigenLayer.Restaked rollups provider AltLayer has launched a staking feature, allowing ALT token holders to provide economic security to AltLayer's ecosystem.The project launched its ALT token in January with an airdrop for early adopters. ALT hit an all-time high of $0.68 earlier today, according to Coingecko. Currently changing hands for $0.58, the token commands a $730 million market capitalization.ALT PriceThe staking feature is part of the phased rollout of AltLayer’s MACH Alpha, a layer built on top of EigenLayer's restaking mechanism, designed to support Optimism Mainnet and Arbitrum One.MACH Alpha is designed to overcome the slow finality of Ethereum's mainnet, which often results in latency-sensitive applications relying on centralized sequencers for transaction publication. This fast finality layer will offer quicker transaction confirmation, crypto-economic security, and decentralized validation of rollup states.Users can stake their tokens on the platform to earn rewards. The phased rollout plan for MACH Alpha includes additional features such as access for external operators and support for restaked assets. The final launch of MACH Alpha as an Actively Validated Service is expected to take place after EigenLayer's mainnet launch.

El Salvador Adds to Bitcoin Stash, Now Holds Nearly $400 Million in ‘Digital Gold’ - Decrypt

El Salvador’s Bitcoin-loving leader Nayib Bukele has added to the country’s crypto holdings, which have swelled to almost $400 million in virtual currency.In a Monday Twitter post, the popular President showed off an address holding over 5,695 BTC. At today’s prices, that would mean the country holds over $391 million in digital coins. President Bukele’s administration was previously opaque about its Bitcoin buys. The leader would post on Twitter when he would buy the asset—even boasting that he’d snap it up naked or “in the toilet”—but exact figures could not be obtained from the government’s press office or website. He then said on the platform in 2022 that the country would buy 1 BTC every day. Earlier this month, he announced that the country had moved a “big chunk” of its holdings to cold storage, and revealed a crypto wallet address in the process.President Bukele’s idea to put Bitcoin in the government’s coffers came after he announced that the asset would be made legal tender back in 2021—alongside the U.S. dollar. The policy was criticized by the IMF and U.S. politicians but the eccentric leader carried on with the plan.  Despite El Salvador’s Bitcoin law, which asks businesses to accept BTC if they have the means to do so, Decrypt found during a 2021 visit that Salvadorans weren’t using the asset much at all to buy things. Subsequent studies and polls confirmed that citizens in the tiny country weren’t crypto crazy, either. But Bukele is still wildly popular with Salvadorans after having cleaned up the country’s once sky-high crime rate. Human rights activists have argued that it has come at a cost, though, and that Salvadoran authorities have allegedly hurt innocent people in a massive gang crackdown that has imprisoned 1% of the population. Bukele nonetheless won reelection in February by a huge landslide. Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Ethereum Designated As Commodity By CFTC, Triggering Regulatory Conflict With SEC | Bitcoinist.com


								A recent development highlights the ongoing interagency drama between the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): the classification of major cryptocurrencies has become a focal point of contention. 
Once again, the CFTC has affirmed its position that Ethereum (ETH) and several other cryptocurrencies should be classified as commodities, intensifying the battle for regulatory oversight in the expansive digital assets industry.
Regulatory Rift With SEC Over Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Litecoin Classification
The latest episode in this regulatory feud unfolded with the CFTC filing a complaint against the crypto exchange KuCoin, coinciding with the unsealing of an indictment by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) against KuCoin and its founders, Chun Gan and Ke Tang. 
The CFTC’s complaint alleged that KuCoin engaged in illegal off-exchange commodity futures transactions and leveraged, margined, or financed retail commodity transactions. 
Furthermore, the exchange was accused of operating without the necessary registrations, failing to supervise its activities diligently, and neglecting to implement an effective customer identification program.

However, the most striking aspect of the complaint lies in the CFTC’s assertion that KuCoin facilitated trading involving digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC), recognizing them as commodities. 
An excerpt of the CFTC complaint highlights Ethereum as a commodity. Source: Jake Chervinsky on X
This starkly contrasts with the SEC’s current stance, championed by Chair Gary Gensler, which suggests that only Bitcoin holds the commodity classification, leaving other cryptocurrencies outside this designation, including Ethereum.
This ongoing turf war over cryptocurrency classification has a history, as evidenced by the CFTC’s previous lawsuit against Binance last year, where Ethereum and Litecoin were also deemed commodities. 
Legal Experts Suggest Turf War Over Crypto Jurisdiction
The discrepancies between the two regulatory bodies have sparked debate within the industry, with legal experts such as Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at venture capital firm Variant, interpreting the CFTC’s position as a challenge to the SEC’s authority. 
Chervinsky suggests that the CFTC’s message to the SEC is that numerous digital assets should be regarded as commodities, indicating that the cryptocurrency space is within the jurisdiction of both agencies, even if the CFTC’s approach is less vocal. Chervinsky’s statement further reads:
Usually, the SEC and CFTC pretend they aren’t in a turf war over crypto. Today the CFTC is openly attacking the SEC’s supposed investigation of ETH. This may seem minor, but is actually pretty savage interagency drama by DC standards… I read it as CFTC saying to SEC ~ a ton of other digital assets are commodities too and you’re not the only one who gets to judge them; this space belongs to us just as much as you, even if we aren’t as loud about it.

As the CFTC and SEC clash intensifies, the industry awaits further developments and official rulings that will shape the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and their respective classifications.

At the time of writing, the price of ETH stands at $3,543, experiencing a slight 0.6% decline in the past 24 hours. This follows a notable 5% rebound over the past seven days.

Russia’s finance minister stresses the importance of crypto regulation 1

Russia’s finance minister Anton Siluanov recently discussed the issues surrounding crypto regulation and its usage across the country. The minister, at a lecture, talked about the need to drum up regulations that will help the sector thrive. He also talked about regulators and the issues they are facing in the industry.Russia’s finance minister drums up the need for crypto regulationAlthough the minister’s stance when it comes to crypto mining in the country is firm, he is being opposed by the Central Bank of Russia over the absence of regulatory oversight of the assets in the country. The bank’s stance is not new, because it has been against legalizing the use of digital assets citing various issues about control.Despite being opposed when it comes to domestic circulation, Siluanov talked about his openness to using mined digital assets to settle international payments. He also talked about the importance of collaborating with the central bank to come up with rules for the assets.The topic of cryptocurrency regulation in Russia has been a subject of deliberation for several years. Siluanov’s intention to engage with central bank officials highlights the government’s dedication to devising a balanced approach that considers both the opportunities and risks associated with cryptocurrencies.Russian President Vladimir Putin’s endorsement of digital currencies introduces another dimension to this discourse. Since 2022, Putin has advocated for leveraging digital currencies for international payments, showcasing a strategic interest in harnessing blockchain technology for financial transactions.A clear approach to crypto and international transactionsThis alignment with digital currencies mirrors Russia’s broader initiatives in the fintech arena. According to the Skolkovo Fintech Hub, a state-run entity, Russian miners generated substantial amounts of cryptocurrencies in 2022, underscoring the burgeoning economic impact of cryptocurrency mining activities in the country.The recent enactment of a law by President Putin to regulate the utilization of digital currencies for international payments signifies a step forward in establishing clarity and legal frameworks for such transactions. Nonetheless, discussions regarding the domestic use and circulation of cryptocurrencies remain intricate and necessitate meticulous consideration of regulatory implications.Siluanov’s statements epitomize the ongoing endeavors to navigate these intricate challenges. He emphasized the necessity of defining the permissible and impermissible uses of mined cryptocurrencies, particularly in the realm of domestic and international payments. This nuanced approach acknowledges the potential advantages of digital currencies for cross-border transactions while also addressing concerns surrounding regulatory oversight and control.Anton Siluanov’s commentary underscores the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation in Russia. As discussions persist and regulatory frameworks evolve, striking a balance between harnessing the benefits of digital currencies and mitigating associated risks will be imperative for Russia’s financial ecosystem.

Dormant Bitcoins on the Move: An Unexpected Boon for BTC? - DailyCoin


        
Old Bitcoin holdings have been consolidated and moved, sparking talks of strategic asset repositioning.



The Bitcoin halving event is approaching and has historically been linked to price increases.



This recent Bitcoin movement has followed prior instances of dormant BTC being awakened.
The Bitcoin market has witnessed a flurry of activity recently, with large sums of the cryptocurrency changing hands. These movements have sparked discussions among analysts about a potential “sell-side liquidity crisis” brewing in the digital asset space.Bitcoin Consolidation Sparks Talk of Sell-OffOne particularly noteworthy transaction involved the consolidation of 2,000 Bitcoin, mined in 2010, into a single wallet. Developer Mononautical identified this activity, suggesting the coins may have been sold via an over-the-counter (OTC) trade. Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, believes this movement signifies a “sell-side liquidity crisis waking up old Bitcoin.”A sell-side liquidity crisis occurs when there’s a shortage of sellers willing to part with their assets. This scarcity can make it difficult for buyers to find sellers at their desired price points, potentially leading to price volatility.The recent consolidation comes amidst heightened anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, expected around 21 April 2024. This pre-programmed mechanism in Bitcoin’s code reduces the block reward for miners by half, effectively limiting the new Bitcoin entering circulation. This event historically coincides with price appreciation for Bitcoin.Recent Activity Has Analysts DividedAdding to the intrigue, another significant transfer occurred over the weekend. The fifth-wealthiest Bitcoin address, which held 94,500 since 2019, fragmented its holdings and sent them to three separate addresses. The purpose and plans for these transferred Bitcoins remain unclear.These large-scale movements follow an incident in January where an individual seemingly sent 26.9 Bitcoin to the irretrievable Bitcoin Genesis wallet, the first-ever wallet on the network. Additionally, in July 2023, a dormant wallet containing over 1,000 Bitcoin, inactive for eleven years, suddenly transferred its entire holdings.



While the exact motivations behind these recent Bitcoin movements remain to be seen, they collectively paint a picture of increased activity within the long-dormant segments of the cryptocurrency market. Whether this signifies a coming sell-off or a strategic repositioning of assets in anticipation of the halving event remains a topic of debate among analysts.On the Flipside
The consolidation of old Bitcoins could indicate renewed interest from early adopters, potentially bringing fresh investment to the market.



A sell-side liquidity crisis, if it occurs, can lead to price volatility as buyers might have to offer more to entice sellers or struggle to find sellers at all.
Why This MattersThe awakening of long-dormant Bitcoins and the upcoming halving injects uncertainty into the market. This uncertainty could trigger price volatility as analysts debate whether these movements foreshadow a potential sell-off or a pre-halving strategic play, impacting not just Bitcoin but potentially the broader cryptocurrency market.Curious about a large Bitcoin wallet that recently moved for the first time in four years?

OKX API glitch leads to incorrect account balances, causing confusion among thousands of users.
                        The OKX API has recently been plagued by a technical glitch that has left users in Singapore, Japan, and the United States with incorrect account balances.According to reports on the OKX Telegram, affected users have experienced a range of issues, from accounts displaying zero balances to others showing balances skyrocketing into the tens of millions.The widespread nature of the OKX API glitch has caused major frustration among traders, who have reported losses due to their inability to access or close positions.OKX Acknowledges Rest API Issues and Reassures Users
In response to the numerous user complaints, OKX has acknowledged the issues with their Rest API, which facilitates connections to external services through standard HTTP requests.The Rest API experienced a crash during this time, leading to errors, incorrect data, and failures when attempting to execute trades.OKX has reassured users that their engineering team is actively working to resolve the API glitch and has emphasized the safety of user assets throughout the incident.The exchange has also stated that their WebSocket, app, and website remain unaffected by the glitch.Despite these assurances, the OKX API glitch has had repercussions on the exchange’s native token, OKB, causing a 2.21% decline in its value to $64.59 as of writing.Recent Developments and Glitches in the Crypto Space
Prior to the current OKX API glitch, the exchange had recently integrated Uniswap Labs’ application programming interface (API) into its decentralized exchange (DEX) to allow gas-free trading through a feature called “Snap.”This feature was intended to simplify decentralized token swapping and provide direct connection with Uniswap, granting the OKX DEX access to the UniswapX protocol and its liquidity.However, the OKX API glitch is not an isolated incident in the crypto space. In recent weeks, platforms such as Coinbase and Solana have also been affected by outages and glitches.Solana experienced a nearly 5-hour outage in early February, wherein block production abruptly ceased. The issue was traced back to an infinite recompile loop triggered by a legacy loader program within the JIT cache, necessitating a network upgrade and restart by validator operators.Coinbase, meanwhile, encountered an outage that led to a $100 billion loss in Bitcoin market cap within just 15 minutes in late February. The disruption occurred during a period of substantial rally in Bitcoin prices, with CEO Brian Armstrong attributing the outage to unexpectedly high demand.

KuCoin plans $10M airdrop of BTC, KCS as Justice Dept., CFTC circle

Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin will hold an airdrop of Bitcoin (BTC) and its native KuCoin (KCS) token worth $10 million, according to a letter from CEO Johnny Lyu posted on the exchange’s blog on March 27. The news comes a day after the United States Justice Department announced charges against the exchange and two of  its founders.Lyu did not mention the federal charges, although he alluded to them in the first sentence of his letter:“I would like to express my gratitude to all KuCoin users, for your support, trust and companionship during the past few days.”Comparing the airdrop to the exchange’s reimbursement of its investors who lost money in the Confido rug pull, Lyu continued:“Recently, on March 26th and 27th, some users experienced longer-than-expected wait times during the withdrawal process. […] To express our profound gratitude for your support and patience KuCoin will launch a special airdrop event totaling 10 million USD in KCS and BTC.”Rules for the airdrop will be released in three days, Lyu wrote. The recent delays in withdrawals were possibly caused by the high volume as wary customers abandoned the exchange. The airdrop thus rewards users who remained loyal to the exchange in its time of crisis.Related: KuCoin agrees to ban New York residents and pay $22 million settlementThe timing of the airdrop is noteworthy since KuCoin was hit with a barrage of legal actions one day earlier. The Justice Department unsealed an indictment for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act for lacking an Anti-Money Laundering program by the two founders and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Simultaneously, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) initiated a civil case against the exchange for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.Source: Wu BlockchainKuCoin hastened to assure users that their assets were safe after the charges were filed and KCS fell 12% in 24 hours. Airdrops come with risks, not the least of which is the possibility of regulatory action. The SEC wrote in its document “Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets”: “The lack of monetary consideration for digital assets, such as those distributed via a so-called ‘air drop,’ does not mean that the investment of money prong [of the Howey test] is not satisfied; therefore, an airdrop may constitute a sale or distribution of securities.” The DeFi Education Fund teamed up with a small Texas clothing company sued for a declaratory judgment against the SEC to prevent the agency from prosecuting the company for holding an airdrop.Magazine: Cool green mayor giving a grand in Bitcoin to each resident

Binance to End Support for TRC-20 USDC Tokens Following Circle's Withdrawal from Tron Network



                    
Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, is set to discontinue the support for deposits and withdrawals of USD Coin (USDC) tokens based on the TRC-20 protocol from the Tron blockchain, effective April 5. 



This decision follows an announcement on February 20 by Circle, the issuer of USDC, regarding its move to halt the support for the stablecoin on the Tron network. 




Circle’s choice is part of a broader strategy to maintain USDC’s reliability, transparency, and security. Alongside ceasing its support, 



Circle also ceased the minting of USDC on Tron’s blockchain on the same date, with a plan to fully phase out its involvement with this network.



The impact of Circle’s decision extended to Binance, which, due to its significant trading volume, plays a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market. 




Binance’s announcement to end TRC-20 USDC support came on March 25, providing a 12-day window for users to manage their assets accordingly. 



Although Binance will stop facilitating deposits and withdrawals of TRC-20 USDC tokens, the platform will continue to support USDC trading activities beyond the cut-off date. 



It’s important to note that this change will not affect USDC transactions over other blockchains supported by Binance, and the decision has garnered positive feedback within the crypto community on social media platform X.



Circle has not explicitly stated why it chose to withdraw support for Tron, mentioning only a continuous evaluation of blockchain platforms within its risk management strategy.

In response to these developments, a Tron representative expressed to Cointelegraph that the blockchain was left in the dark about the specifics behind Circle’s decision and was not notified prior to the public announcement.



Amidst these changes, Tron is exploring innovative approaches to maintain its relevance and utility within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 



Notably, Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, has shared plans to implement a Bitcoin layer-2 solution aimed at introducing a “wrapped” version of Tether to the network. 



This initiative is expected to bridge Tron directly with Bitcoin, potentially unlocking access to over $55 billion in Bitcoin network value. 



Sun’s announcement outlines a roadmap for integrating stablecoins and tokens between Tron and Bitcoin, which could significantly enhance Bitcoin’s financial ecosystem.

                        VanEck advisor Gabor Gurbacs expressed concerns on March 27 over the incompetence of modern-day crypto regulations and their negative effects on innovations.His criticism stemmed from the instability in the crypto industry as it relates to the regulatory framework in light of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) postponement of potential approval of VanEck’s spot Ethereum ETF application.VanEck Advisor Asserts Regulations Prioritizes Political & Personal Interests
Gurbacs shared his dissatisfaction in an X post, as he highlighted the extent of the limitation of innovations and the negative economic outlook caused by ineffective regulatory frameworks by relevant authorities.The shared concern by the VanEck advisor came shortly after the SEC announced the delay in VanEck’s spot Ether ETF application on March 20.Gurbacs also drew attention to the rise of scammers in the blockchain sector, which has become a hotbed for fraud.His observation aligns with Chainalysis 2024 crypto crime report data, which disclosed that illicit crypto addresses received $24.2 billion in 2023.Additionally, the advisor noted that while there are a few exceptions to his criticism, regulators must provide and implement new structures to build tomorrow’s markets.“It’s not excusable or tolerable to prioritize personal/political interests and senseless bureaucracy over national interests and capital formation,” he said. “Not ever but particularly not in the economic condition where the world is now.”Meanwhile, two events corroborating Gubarcs’ concerns include the DoJ indictment against the KuCoin exchange and the SEC settlement with Binance.Federal prosecutors in Manhattan had on March 26 charged KuCoin and two of its founders, Chun Gan and Ke Tang, over an alleged violation of the US anti-money laundering (AML) laws and for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.Some analysts and market players believe the fresh lawsuit will probably result in a huge settlement as it did for Binance.It could be recalled that the SEC had charged Binance for multiple offenses like fraud, AML violation, sales of unregistered assets, and more in 2023 before the exchange was slammed with a federal resolution charge of $4 billion. However, it should be noted that Binance is not the crypto exchange in the eye of the storm of the SEC – Coinbase was sued a day after Binance.While Federal charge settlements seem to be a fair penalty for large firms, the VanEck advisor believes that the existing crypto regulations are biased.VanEck Joins Others in Waitlist for SEC’s Greenlight
SEC’s delayed announcement of VanEck’s spot Ether ETF proposal puts the asset manager on a waitlist that includes Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock, Ark 21 shares, Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, and the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF.Experts believe these postponements indicate a trend of caution by the SEC in approving crypto-based ETFs.The speculation surrounding the decision on a spot Ethereum ETF has been a topic of contention. Recent optimism about crypto ETFs has diminished, however, with Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas revising his prior forecasts of the possibility of approval by May 23 to become uncertain.Meanwhile, a local news report suggested that the US regulatory agency plans to classify ETH as a security and has issued subpoenas to three companies to investigate the Ethereum Foundation, the entity behind the Ethereum blockchain network.While the SEC had previously approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, Ethereum ETFs may encounter regulatory obstacles.Regardless, VanEck and other participants wait patiently for the Ethereum ETF green light, similar to Bitcoin ETFs, which has an impressive record of $57B in on-chain holdings, representing 4.17% of the current BTC supply.

Coinbase Increases USDC Reserves as TVL Surpasses $1 Billion - DailyCoin


        
Coinbase has begun storing more USDC on Base to enable faster transactions and lower fees.



The USDC landscape has changed as Circle has halted issuance on the Tron blockchain.



Binance has delisted Tron-based USDC deposits and withdrawals, although USDC trading remains unaffected.
In a move aimed at streamlining customer fund management, Coinbase announced plans to increase its storage of USDC, a popular stablecoin, on Base. This Ethereum Layer 2 solution, built by Coinbase and powered by the OP Stack, promises significant advantages including lower fees, faster transaction times, and enhanced security.Coinbase Leverages Base Layer 2 Max Branzburg, Coinbase’s Vice President and Head of Consumer Products, revealed the decision, highlighting user benefits. He encouraged other companies to adopt a similar approach and transition their business on-chain."This enables us to manage and secure customer funds with lower fees and faster settlement times, with no impact to the Coinbase user experience," he stated in a recent post.He further encouraged other companies to adopt a similar approach and transition their business on-chain. The crypto community has responded positively to the announcement. Jesse Pollak, a contributor to Base, expressed his support and excitement for Coinbase’s move. He described the decision as “based” and pledged continued assistance for Coinbase’s on-chain endeavors. This development comes amidst a period of rapid growth for Base. According to Defi Llama, user deposits on the platform have surpassed a staggering $1 billion, doubling since the beginning of March. This surge is largely attributed to the decentralized exchange Aerodrome, which has contributed a significant portion of the locked value since its rise in February. Additionally, Base has witnessed a notable increase in transaction counts, surpassing other optimistic rollup solutions in growth.Circle Announces Changes to Token CreationMeanwhile, the landscape surrounding USDC is undergoing further changes. Boston-based Circle, the firm behind USDC, has announced plans to discontinue the creation of USDC tokens on the Tron blockchain. 



Citing a focus on transparency, trustworthiness, and safety, Circle stated that the decision stemmed from a company-wide evaluation. This move was followed by a similar announcement by Binance, which will no longer facilitate Tron-based USDC deposits and withdrawals.Importantly, Binance emphasized that USDC trading remains unaffected on its platform, and deposits and withdrawals through other supported networks will continue as usual. With a current circulation of approximately $32.1 billion, USDC remains the second-largest stablecoin globally after Tether and ranks as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency overall. While most USDC tokens reside on the Ethereum blockchain, Coinbase’s decision to leverage Base for its USDC reserves signifies a potential shift towards a more efficient and secure future for the stablecoin.On the Flipside
While Base promises security, Layer 2 solutions inherently introduce additional security risks compared to the base layer (Ethereum in this case).



Coinbase storing a significant amount of USDC on Base, a network they built, raises centralization concerns.
Why This MattersCoinbase’s move to store USDC on Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, could set a precedent for wider adoption of Layer 2 technologies. This shift can potentially improve transaction speeds, reduce fees, and enhance security for USDC and other cryptocurrencies within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Fidelity Makes a New Ethereum Spot ETF Move - Bloomberg ETF Analyst Reveals Likelihood of ETFs Approval - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to recent SEC filings, Fidelity has filed a Form S-1 for its spot Ethereum ETF, which also includes staking.
Fidelity has filed an S-1 for its Ethereum ETF, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart confirmed. “This is not a change; this is the company's first application. They had only filed 19b-4 to date,” Seyffart said.


Despite this development, Seyffart remains skeptical about the ETF's approval. “That doesn't change our view right now. We still think we're likely to see rejection in May,” he added.
According to Seyffart, the chances of spot Ethereum ETFs being approved in May are decreasing. Seyffart cited U.S. regulators' lack of engagement with potential issuers on the products as a contributing factor to the rejection. “We now believe these products will be ultimately rejected for this round on May 23,” the analyst wrote in an earlier post. He and his colleague Eric Balchunas had previously given a 35% chance of approval in May.






The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had previously postponed a decision regarding spot ETH ETFs. However, he will have to make a decision by May 23 as it is the deadline for one of the applicants.
Form S-1 SEC is the initial registration form required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for new securities for public companies incorporated in the United States. Any securities that meet the criteria must file an S-1 before the shares can be listed on a national exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange.


Currently, seven companies plan to launch an Ethereum fund: BlackRock, Fidelity, Galaxy with Invesco, Grayscale, VanEck, Ark with 21Shares, and Hashdex.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Could Drop to $400 - Here's Why


Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price is making another attempt at breaching the year-to-date high, although, by the looks of it, this may not happen.
Multiple reasons are contributing to the bearish anticipation, but this could be turned around if BCH flips a crucial level into support.
Bitcoin Cash Whales Signal Drawdown
Bitcoin Cash price will potentially bear the impact of the bearishness exhibited by the whales. These large wallet investors tend to sway the direction of the price action. Historically, their selling has induced corrections, while accumulation has resulted in rallies.
This time around, the outcome is expected to be bearish since the addresses hodling between 1,000 to 10,000 BCH have been consistently selling since March began. Nearly 50,000 BCH worth over $25 million were sold in the last week alone.

However, since the price kept going upward, the altcoin is now due for a correction.
Read More: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030
As a matter of fact, even retail investors are going to sell their holdings now. The Market Value signals this to the Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The MVRV ratio measures investors’ profit/loss.
Bitcoin Cash’s 30-day MVRV at 10% signals profit, potentially prompting selling. Historically, BCH corrections have occurred when the indicator is between 7%-17% MVRV, labeled a danger zone.

Thus, BCH is vulnerable to corrections due to selling, which could occur at any time.
BCH Price Prediction: What to Expect?
If selling begins, Bitcoin Cash price will likely fail in testing the $501 resistance as support, even if it does manage to breach it. A decline to $448 will result in BCH losing the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
Falling through this support will result in a drop to $400 or $378, which marks the confluence of the 100-day EMA.

However, the altcoin could invalidate the bearish thesis if the breach and testing of $501 as support be successful. BCH would then be open to rising towards $520.

Tether's Dark Crown: Most Used Stablecoin In Illicit Crypto Transactions, Reports TRM


								While Tether (USDT), the world’s leading stablecoin, has been pivotal in facilitating transactions across the blockchain space, a recent analysis by blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs sheds light on a less desirable aspect of USDT’s ubiquity: its significant use within illicit crypto flows during the past year.
This development unfolds against declining overall volumes of illegal transactions in the crypto sector, a trend attributed to heightened sanctions and regulatory actions against various entities within the ecosystem.

At the Heart Of Illicit Crypto Transactions?
According to TRM Labs’ review, Tether accounted for $19.3 billion of the illicit transaction volume in 2023, marking a decrease from $24.7 billion in the preceding year. Despite this reduction, USDT remained the most utilized stablecoin for criminal purposes, including a notable dominance in terrorist financing activities.
TRM’s findings specifically highlight the use of USDT on the Tron blockchain, which hosts a “significant portion of Tether’s total volume,” as the preferred currency for terrorist financing entities. According to TRM, this blockchain saw a 125% increase in terror-financing-related addresses receiving USDT.
The analysis further breaks down the distribution of illicit flows across major blockchains. Tron was responsible for 45% of these flows, showing an increase from the previous year.
According to the report, the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains followed, facilitating 24% and 18% of the illegal transactions.
In comparison, the second-largest stablecoin, USDC, issued by Circle, was linked to a lower volume of illicit activity, totaling $428.9 million.
A Tether spokesperson said to Bloomberg in response to the TRM Labs report:
While we don’t have access to the report, historical evidence repeatedly shows that transactional figures have often been exaggerated due to a misinterpretation of data that assumes that if a service receives some small portion of illicit funds then all funds in the service are illicit, significantly inflating the actual values.
Notably, this shift in the landscape of illicit crypto transactions coincides with a broader trend of declining illegal fund volumes in the sector, which fell to $34.8 billion in 2023 from $49.5 billion the year before, as highlighted by TRM.
TRM Labs attributes this positive development partly to a “threefold increase in sanctions” and regulatory measures targeting “crypto-related businesses and individuals.”
Tether’s Efforts And Regulatory Scrutiny
Despite TRM’s claims in the report, Tether’s stance against the misuse of its stablecoin is worth noting. Last year, Tether collaborated with US authorities and the OKX crypto exchange to freeze $225 million of its stablecoin linked to a criminal syndicate.
Furthermore, last year, Tether faced criticism, including from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which pointed out the popularity of stablecoin among money launderers and fraudsters, especially in the context of online gambling platforms.
In response to these criticisms, Tether defended its operations, emphasizing the “transparency” and “traceability” of transactions on public blockchains, which, according to Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, makes USDT an “impractical choice” for conducting illicit activities.

The company also expressed disappointment over assessments that focus solely on the negative uses of its stablecoin, arguing that such perspectives overlook USDT’s role in supporting developing economies in emerging markets.

UK Regulators Release Guidance for ‘Finfluencers’ and Memes Promoting Financial Products - The Daily Hodl


								Regulators in the United Kingdom are releasing new regulations for influencers and memes that promote financial products.
In a new press release, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is giving out new guidelines on how social media can be used to promote financial products, including fintech and digital assets, as a means of combating fraud.










According to the FCA, in the future, influencers may not be allowed to promote financial products – including through memes – without the approval of an FCA-authorized person.
“The FCA has set out how adverts across social media channels must be fair, clear and not misleading, meaning they must have balance and carry the right risk warnings so people can make well informed financial decisions. Social media has become a central part of firms’ marketing strategies. 
Firms are on the hook for all their promotions and the FCA has warned they need to ensure influencers they work with communicate to their followers in the right way. 
And influencers are reminded that promoting a financial product without approval from an FCA-authorized person with the right permission could be a criminal offense.” 
Lucy Castledine, Director of Consumer Investments at the FCA, says in the press release that in 2023, regulators removed over 10,000 misleading advertisements alone.
“Any marketing for financial products must be fair, clear and not misleading so consumers can invest, save or borrow with confidence. Promotions aren’t just about the likes, they’re about the law. 
We will take action against those touting financial products illegally. Social media will not always be the best place to promote complex products. Firms need to consider whether a platform that offers limited characters or space is the right place to do so.”

UK Issues Guidance and Warning on Memecoins - Bitcoin Sistemi


The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is turning the regulatory spotlight on memecoin 'finfluencers' as it seeks to rein in memecoin-centric marketing for financial products.
The FCA has published guidelines for both financial services companies and social media influencers who create memecoins about cryptocurrencies or other investments. The regulator emphasizes that all marketing must be transparent and not misleading.


The FCA stated that 'finfluencers' must obtain approval from an FCA-appointed representative before advertising financial products and services or issuing memecoins. “Influencers are reminded that it may be a criminal offense to promote a financial product without the consent of an FCA authorized person with the correct consent,” the regulator wrote.
The FCA also urged consumers to be wary of questionable advertising and online scams. He stated that it is important for influencers to ensure they comply with the rules and consider the potential damage to their reputation if they are found to be promoting illegal products.






Lucy Castledine, the FCA's director of consumer investment, said the watchdog would “take action against those who promote financial products illegally”. The regulator noted that promotion through memecoins is particularly popular in the cryptocurrency industry, which has a dedicated memecoin space.
The FCA's latest warning comes after it stressed last month that it would take action against firms running illegal financial promotions. Last year, the agency issued 450 warnings as part of its enforcement efforts against illegal cryptocurrency advertising.

Apple wins antitrust suit over Venmo, Cash App fees after judge tosses case

United States District Judge Vince Chhabria dismissed an antitrust lawsuit brought against Apple by Venmo and Cash App customers over allegations the California company’s Apple Cash product was anti-competitive. The lawsuit, initially filed on Nov. 17, 2023, in San Jose, sought to hold Apple accountable for its perceived monopolistic practices involving the Apple iOS App Store. Per the complaint, Apple allegedly makes it difficult or impossible for competitors to the Apple Pay service to introduce desirable features such as integrating decentralized cryptocurrency payments into existing or new products and services. As such, the complainants allege that Venmo, CashApp, and other existing or new services are unable to introduce features that would lead to competitive pricing and improved functionality for iOS end users. Related: Apple sued for blocking crypto tech for P2P paymentsJudge Chhabria granted Apple’s motion for dismissal on March 26, 20. According to the case filing, the complaint suffered from “several fatal issues.”The filing goes on to state that the plaintiffs failed to establish what antitrust actions took place, nor did they establish why competitors such as Zelle weren’t included in the initial complaint. It also refers to the plaintiff’s suit as “speculative,” and outlines what the court perceives as a flawed premise. Essentially, the initial complaint alleges that Apple’s terms of service for products such as Venmo and Cash App to appear on the App Store prohibit those companies from including cryptocurrency features in their products. The judge’s ruling cites the relevant rule (Guideline 3.1.5 in the App Store T.O.S.) and dismisses its applicability in the suit.According to the filing:“Even assuming that Guideline 3.1.5 restricts decentralized cryptocurrency transactions (which seems doubtful), it is not clear how companies agreeing to a guideline outlining the Apple Store requirements for apps facilitating cryptocurrency transactions constitutes an unlawful agreement.”Going forward, the plaintiffs have 21 days from the date of the filing to submit amendments to the case that could compel the court to move forward with the lawsuit before the dismissal becomes record. However, the odds may not be in the plaintiff’s favor, given the tenor of the judge’s final remarks in the filing:“The plaintiffs should not assume that the defects mentioned in this ruling are the only ones in the complaint. Apple’s motion to dismiss has put them on notice of many more potential problems. Indeed, it is difficult to see how amendment could salvage this case. But, in an abundance of caution, the motion to dismiss is granted with leave to amend. If no amended complaint is filed within 21 days of this ruling, dismissal will be with prejudice.”

KuCoin Witnesses $1B In Withdrawals As Exchange Is Accused Of Money Laundering: 'SEC Trying To Protect Us From Making Money?' Questions Trader - Benzinga

Leading cryptocurrency exchange, KuCoin saw a massive $1 billion in crypto withdrawals over the past 24 hours, coinciding with a notable decrease in the exchange’s assets.What Happened: Arkham Intelligence data highlighted KuCoin exchange balance at $4.7 billion, down from more than $6 billion the prior day. This decline was attributed to a substantial amount of assets being withdrawn by investors amid allegations of money laundering against the exchange by the U.S. Department of Justice. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams stated, "KuCoin allegedly deliberately chose not to implement even basic anti-money laundering policies."The accused crypto exchange KuCoin witnessed around $1 billion in crypto withdrawals over the past 24 hours and assets under management plunged 20% amid the exchange facing charges from U.S. authorities, as reported by CoinDesk citing Nansen and Arkham Intelligence data.  Amidst many loopholes in the functioning of cryptocurrency exchange, Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets conference, scheduled for Nov. 19, will bring industry leaders and investors together to discuss the future of digital asset investments.Also Read: Philippines Blocks Binance Over Unlicensed Operations, Citing Investor ProtectionWhy It Matters: The U.S. Department of Justice noted KuCoin purposely failed to comply with anti-money laundering laws to grow its platform. The indictment further detailed KuCoin's alleged attempts to conceal its activities from U.S. regulators, including not requiring customer identification and falsely claiming to have no U.S. customers, said a Benzinga article.A crypto trader, Doncrypto questioned, "What ever Kucoin did wrong? They even made it KYC mandatory to comply with regulations?”, adding “Why is SEC trying to protect us from making money?Notable NFT and crypto expert, Foster Hilt tweeted about KuCoin joining the list of exchanges facing scrutiny, alongside Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Hilt emphasized the current lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. cryptocurrency landscape.  Hilt’s tweet concluded with a reminder: “This is yet another reminder that regardless of how big or reputable an exchange appears to be, the best practice is to always self-custody your crypto.”The allegations against KuCoin, especially in the lead-up to the Bitcoin halving event, have broader implications for the crypto market and its operations as a whole.

ChatGPT crypto scam videos are flooding YouTube

Have you seen YouTube ads recently for a “slippage bot” that uses ChatGPT and promises to help you earn passive income with crypto? It’s a scam. And it’s ripping off a lot of people, all while using unsuspecting actors hired on Fiverr who don’t understand what they’ve been hired to read. One of the actors tells Gizmodo he ultimately didn’t even get paid for his work, despite his face showing up constantly on YouTube under accounts he doesn’t control.Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?The videos all follow the same basic script. They open with an actor saying they personally created a bot using ChatGPT that allows anyone to earn money without any real coding knowledge. Early in the videos, the actors warn that the crypto community has lots of scammers, so it’s important that the viewer not interact with “unfamiliar wallets” and “unknown exchanges.”After getting the ironic warning about scammers out of the way, the script then dives into where you can copy code that can be pasted into a website that will supposedly execute a so-called front run on crypto transactions. You’ll have to link up your crypto wallet, of course, for the entire thing to work. The underlying idea, also known as a sandwich attack, is a real thing done by unethical crypto traders to extract money. But that’s not what will happen if you try to execute the code in the video.If you actually just breeze through the code, there’s nothing inherently suspicious about it, aside from the promise of free money. But that’s because the real wallet address has been hidden inside by splitting it up into pieces. Anyone who connects their Metamask wallet and runs the code simply sends their crypto to one of many wallets controlled by the anonymous scammers.The videos all follow the same basic script with minor changes and the only real difference between many of the videos is the wording about  how much you’ll supposedly make with their technique. Sometimes the titles and thumbnails promise $2,000 a day or $3,000 per day, while others list the amounts in ethereum or percentages. But anyone who follows the video’s instructions is going to make precisely zero dollars, and instead send their crypto to scammers.Gizmodo has yet to find evidence that anyone who’s appearing in these videos knows they’re participating in a scam. In fact, three of the people we’ve talked to were all hired on Fiverr for video and voice-acting work. And it’s pretty clear why these scammers are hiring real actors. By laying down a few hundred dollars at a gig-work site like Fiverr, (one actor told us he got $500), these scammers get real people to be the face of their scam without ever revealing their own identities while raking in the real money.As you can see in the short video compilation we’ve compiled below, the  script being read is identical across hundreds of videos on YouTube.Clips from scam YouTube videos featuring unsuspecting actorsThe videos have been an enormous headache for some of the actors involved because there appears to be an army of new YouTube accounts posting the videos every day. The actors have no control over how the videos are being used, and even if they’re able to get some taken down, they’re reappearing constantly on other accounts.“I’ve been contacted by internet security professionals, OSINT  enthusiasts, [...] one victim,  AND multiple people in my real life relationships that have had the  video hit their feeds,” one of the actors, Scott Panfil, told Gizmodo by email on Sunday.Panfil, a 41-year old music teacher in New York, went on to say that at least four “actual friends” have reached out to him since seeing the videos in their YouTube ads. He contacts YouTube every time he finds a new video to get it taken down but it’s quite a game of whack-a-mole.Panfil reached out to Fiverr to ask about the account that hired him and was told it was terminated. But he says Fiverr insisted it couldn’t do anything beyond that. A spokesperson for Fiverr told Gizmodo in an email Tuesday the company has blocked the accounts brought to their attention and are going to provide Panfil with some kind of compensation after he wasn’t paid.“Any attempt to defraud or scam others is in clear violation of our terms of service and strictly prohibited. It is against our Community Standards  to allow anyone to use services offered through Fiverr to promote  intentionally misleading information or fraud, or that can pose  financial risks for our users,” the Fiverr spokesperson said.Many of the scammy videos are  unlisted, meaning they don’t show up in regular YouTube and Google search results. But they frequently appear as paid ads, as you can see below in a screenshot Gizmodo took on March 23. That video on the far right featuring Panfil is “sponsored,” indicated just below the title that it’s being promoted through YouTube’s ad program.Anyone who clicks to view the supposed creator’s other videos will see just five or six created recently. Those videos tend to be generic explainers on technical topics like NFTs and smart contracts, making it appear as though the person who ostensibly created this YouTube page knows what they’re talking about when it comes to crypto. But the person that’s featured on each YouTube account has no control over the content that appears there, as you can see in an account using Panfil’s face below. These people were just hired for a single video on Fiverr and their videos are being reused repeatedly.Most of the tutorials acting as a smokescreen aren’t even narrated. They’re boring and act as nothing more than cover for the paid ads that aren’t even visible to a basic search on YouTube. Again, it should be stressed that the people who have appeared in these ads probably have no idea they’re promoting a scam. And their videos are being used across several accounts.The other common element in all of these YouTube videos is that the comments are overwhelmingly positive, clearly a result of some bot network trying to lend the scams credibility.Oddly enough, Gizmodo first learned about this scam about a month ago while combing through consumer complaints filed with the FTC that mention ChatGPT. We obtained the complaints through the Freedom of Information Act, and one complaint, which was filed on Dec. 27, 2023, really caught our eye:I found a video from YouTube “etsy web3 dev,” YouTuber video called “I used ChatGPT arbitrage Trading Bot to make $1,248 per day - passive income.”I followed instructions to deposit 0.5 Ethereum from my Metamask crypto wallet to an Etherscan contract that I was instructed to create. I did create the contract then used the compiler in ChatGPT to generate profit from my 0.5 ETH that I sent from my Metamask account. Nothing was found in my wallet and YouTuber could not respond my message. I tried again with 0.65 ETH the following day, but still nothing showed in my contract. I suspect the YouTuber to take in a way my Ethereum through the instructions are crooked to steal my money that are now worth $2,500 total.The name of the person who filed the complaint was redacted by the FTC, which is standard practice when the agency releases documents through FOIA, so we were unable to reach out to that person directly. But having the name of a scammy video led us down a rabbit hole where we found hundreds of other videos with similar titles, all promising easy passive income. They were all using the same script and being read by real people.Ever since we started looking into this scam, the YouTube videos have become even more common, as others on social media have reported seeing them frequently in recent days. YouTube spokesperson Javier Hernandez says the platform has “strict policies in place to protect the YouTube community” and six channels have been terminated for scams and other deceptive practices. “We are also in the process of reviewing the ads in question and will take the appropriate action on those that violate our ads policies,” Hernandez said via email. Most of the videos have real actors, but there are some where we never see a person appear aside from the thumbnail. And while almost all of the videos we found containing this scam featured male actors, there were some that featured female voice actors but they rarely had visual representation of an actual woman in the video, aside from some thumbnails.How much are these scammers making? That part is hard to figure out precisely, but Gizmodo messaged one victim who said he lost 1 ETH, which is about $3,300 at the current price. Based on anecdotal reports on various crypto forums the amount being pulled in by these scammers is almost certainly reaching into the hundreds of thousands and beyond.There are a handful of video explainers trying to warn people about the scam. But they haven’t gotten much attention. This video, for example, has just 75,000 views at the time of this writing despite being up for almost a year. Disturbingly, some of the videos claiming to debunk the scam are actually just trying to push their own version of the scam by debunking other videos and claiming they have a real bot that can generate this kind of passive income.Needless to say, you should be wary of anyone promising a way to make easy money. And if you’re an actor looking to do some work through Fiverr, make sure you understand what you’re reading.

Coinbase Loses SEC Case Dismissal Bid: How Big Is the Blow? - DailyCoin


        
Judge Katherine Polk Falia has ruled on Coinbase’s motions to dismiss the SEC case against it.



The ruling was not what many in the crypto industry expected.



Experts have, however, downplayed the impact of the ruling.
After months of anticipation, Judge Katherine Polk Falia has finally entered her ruling on Coinbase‘s motions to dismiss the SEC case against it. The ruling, however, was not what many in the crypto space had hoped for.Following months of deliberation, Judge Falia sided with the SEC on all but one claim, setting the stage for the case to head to trial.How impactful is the ruling in this case that could help shape the future of the crypto industry in the U.S.?Coinbase Motion to Dismiss Largely DeniedIn a decision filed on Wednesday, March 27, Judge Falia denied Coinbase’s motion to dismiss the SEC case against it “in large part,” contending that the federal markets regulator had made a “plausible” case against the exchange for allegedly facilitating the trading of unregistered securities."As explained herein, the 'crypto' nomenclature may be of recent vintage, but the challenged transactions fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years," she wrote.Judge Falia extended the same view to Coinbase’s staking service. The judge cited customers’ dependence on the exchange’s “managerial efforts” in arguments for why the service could fall under the Howey definition of an investment contract.Nonetheless, it was not a landslide win for the SEC, as Judge Falia sided with Coinbase on one claim. Contrary to the agency’s complaint, the judge found that the exchange had not operated as an unregistered broker through its wallet service.



Despite market jitters in response to the ruling, experts have downplayed its impact.Coinbase Dismissal Loss Par for the Course?Responding to the ruling, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal suggested that the outcome was largely expected."Early motions like ours against a government agency are almost always denied. But clarity is the ultimate goal and today's decision continues us on that path," the attorney wrote in a six-part X post.According to Grewal, the exchange remains confident in its arguments and embraces the opportunity to prove them in court.



The Coinbase CLO was not the only one to dismiss the impact of the recent ruling on the case. Chiming in, Brown Rudnick Partner Stephen Palley described the ruling as “work-a-day procedural stuff.”Variant Fund Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky described the ruling as “disappointing,” highlighting the optimism that had followed oral arguments in January 2024. Nonetheless, the lawyer surmised, “it’s only the beginning — not the end — of the SEC’s case against Coinbase.”Judge Falia set a deadline of April 19 for Coinbase and the SEC to come up with a case scheduling plan.On the Flipside
Many in the crypto industry have hailed the court ruling that Coinbase does not offer an unregistered brokerage service through its wallet as a win for DeFi.



With the case going to trial, a jury will decide Coinbase’s fate, not the judge.
Why This MattersThe recent ruling in the SEC case against Coinbase has caused significant concern in the crypto space, with some crypto asset prices sliding in response. Experts, however, suggest that this concern is not warranted.Read this for more on the SEC case against Coinbase:How the Coinbase vs SEC Showdown Could Alter “Securities”See how KuCoin’s recent legal woes affect you:How KuCoin’s DoJ Fight Affects User Funds and What to Do

Fifth Largest Bitcoin Whale Moves $6 Billion In BTC, Here’s The Destination


                            The crypto community’s attention has been drawn to a Bitcoin whale who recently moved a huge portion of their BTC holdings across different wallets. This action has sparked the curiosity of those in the community about the reason for these transactions. 
Bitcoin Whale Moves $6 Billion In BTC
Blockchain analysis platform Arkham Intelligence first brought this occurrence to the community’s attention when it mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Bitcoin address (37XuVSE) had moved over $6 billion in BTC to three new addresses. 

As part of the transactions, $5.03 billion worth of BTC was sent to one of these addresses (bc1q8yj), while the two other addresses (bc1q6m5 and bc1q592) received $561.46 million and $488.40 million worth of BTC respectively. Arkham added that one of the wallets (bc1q592) has since then proceeded to transfer the received funds to another wallet. 
Notably, the wallet which moved $6 billion in BTC was before now the fifth richest Bitcoin address having held over 94,500 BTC in its wallet. As of now, it still holds 1.31 BTC in the wallet in question. Interestingly, before now, this address was dormant as it had not moved any of this BTC which it received since 2019. 
Transactions of such magnitude are always sure to cause a stir in the crypto community, considering the impact such whales can have on the market. Usually, a move like this can cause community members to speculate that the whale may be looking to offload their tokens and take profits. However, the fact that these transactions weren’t made to exchange-linked wallets has quelled such speculations. 
Another BTC Whale On The Rise
Bitcoinist recently reported on BlackRock’s Bitcoin wallet, which has continued to accumulate Bitcoin at an astonishing rate due to the impressive demand for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Despite just launching this ETF in mid-January 2024, BlackRock now holds 243,126 BTC for the fund. 

BlackRock’s BTC holdings has seen it rise to becoming one of the largest corporate BTC holders, only behind centralized exchanges Binance, Bitfinex, and Coinbase and fellow Bitcoin ETF issuer Grayscale. A sustained demand for the IBIT ETF could however see BlackRock surpass these entities at some point. 
That is also something that could reflect positively on Bitcoin’s price seeing as how instituitional demand for the flagship crypto has helped propel it to new highs. 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $70,500, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Massive Bitcoin ETF Growth Will ‘Continue for Years’, Says Bitwise CIO - Decrypt

The overwhelming demand for Bitcoin spot ETFs over the past two months is likely to continue for many years, predicts Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan.The executive highlighted “key takeaways” from his interactions with investors and capital allocators this month who are interested in buying into the ETFs—one managed by Bitwise itself.One takeaway, he recalled in a Twitter post, is that there is “massive dispersion in the pace of adoption of bitcoin ETFs.” While some financial advisors and national account platforms are plugging into the products as early as possible, others aren’t considering any portfolio allocation for their clients—or aren’t enabling them on their platforms until next year.“The truth is, most professional investors still cannot buy bitcoin ETFs,” Hougan wrote. “That will change through a series of 100+ individual due diligence processes over the next two years.”Since launching on January 11, the Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed net inflows of $11.7 billion, despite also factoring in over $14.3 billion of old BTC outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). On Tuesday alone, they took in another $418 million, including $16.7 million for the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.Brazil-based Hashdex announced today that it was finally bringing its Bitcoin spot ETF online.Such flows already represent a massive leg up over previous years when money within institutional Bitcoin funds paled in comparison to today. According to CryptoQuant, this metric has risen from less than $20 billion to over $94.6 billion in the past six months as excitement around the ETFs began to take hold.On-chain data shows that demand from “accumulation addresses”—Bitcoin addresses that only buy and never sell—has also skyrocketed.“We estimate monthly Bitcoin demand has increased from 40K Bitcoin at the start of 2024 to 213K Bitcoin currently,” CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno told Decrypt. “An important part of this demand growth has been driven by ETF buying, but lately also from other large investors.”Compared to previous years, Hougan also said that investors have dialed up their once ideal 1% Bitcoin portfolio share, now preferring 3% or higher. The executive believes ETFs are the cause, having “de-risked” Bitcoin in the eyes of many.“Before, people were worried bitcoin could go to zero. In that world, a 1% allocation is all you can stomach,” he said. “But if “going to zero” is off the table, 3% or 5% starts to make more sense.”According to Coinshares’ Head of Research James Butterfill, most institutional investors remain “very under invested” in Bitcoin, which comprises only a 0.2% average share of their portfolios.“What proportion Bitcoin ends up being is dependent on risk appetite,” Butterfill told Decrypt, “A 4% position would represent only 100 basis point of additional risk in a regularly rebalanced portfolio.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

HSBC rolls out tokenized gold for Hong Kong retail investors 1

Renowned financial institution HSBC has entered the blockchain technology industry by making tokenized gold available for retail investors in Hong Kong. This initiative makes HSBC the first bank to provide retail investors with a tokenized real-world asset (RWAs) on a blockchain platform.HSBC rolls out its gold token for retail investorsAccording to its announcement, the HSBC Gold token is now available on its HSBC Online Banking and the HSBC HK Mobile App. In addition, the gold token can be minted on the Orion digital asset platform owned by the bank. This move reflects a bigger shift towards tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) in the financial and banking industry.Tokenization is simply representing real-world assets as digital assets on a blockchain. This process, which usually offers enhanced security, transparency, and accessibility to users is either on private ledgers or on public blockchains like Ethereum. The firm’s decision to enter the tokenized gold market shows a growing demand for blockchain-based solutions in the financial industry.The firm had previously made hints towards offering tokenized gold as part of its digital asset custody platform when it announced a collaboration with Switzerland-based safekeeping platform Metaco. The successful launch of its gold token shows the bank’s commitment to offering innovative financial products by leveraging distributed ledger technology.HSBC’s Hong Kong’s head of wealth and personal banking Maggie Ng expressed pride in the HSBC Gold Token. The executive highlighted its status as the first retail product in Hong Kong based on distributed ledger technology authorized by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). This approval also adds credibility to the blockchain-based offering of the bank, setting a precedent for similar products in the region.Advantages of tokenized gold for investorsHolding tokenized gold has several advantages for retail investors. Due to the conversation from physical gold to digital tokens, investors can hold a fraction of gold. Aside from that, HSBC also eliminates the need to store gold in physical form while aiding seamless transactions. Moreso, using the blockchain enhances trust while ensuring the immutability and traceability of the tokenized assets.This recent move by HSBC mirrors the trend in the broader financial industry, where financial institutions are looking into blockchain-bass solutions for tokenization among other things like custody and transactions. The integration of blockchain technology into traditional banking shows a shift towards the digital ecosystem and innovation in the financial sector.With blockchain technology gaining momentum across various industries, HSBC’s move underscores the potential of distributed ledger technology. Also, by tokenizing gold and making it available to investors, the firm is opening up new opportunities for investment and financial inclusion in Hong Kong’s market landscape.The launch of the tokenized gold by HABC on its Orion digital assets platform is a landmark milestone in the adoption of blockchain technology in the financial sector. Aside from providing investors with tokenized gold, it also showcases HSBC as a flag bearer in leveraging blockchain for financial products.

Here’s How High Solana (SOL) Could Surge, According to Coin Bureau’s Guy Turner - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says that smart contract platform Solana (SOL) looks bullish on multiple timeframes.
In a new video update, Guy Turner, the host of Coin Bureau, tells his 2.45 million YouTube subscribers that Solana’s weekly and monthly charts foreshadow a 35-45% breakout for the Ethereum (ETH) rival above the $300 price tag.










According to Turner, Solana is also breaking out against Bitcoin (BTC), and he says that since the flagship digital asset is itself on the cusp of a rally due to its upcoming halving event in April, Solana could go even higher.
12:30 “In SOL’s case, it appears to be breaking out against BTC on the weekly and the monthly, foreshadowing a 35 to 45% gain respectively. 
What this means is that if BTC’s price stays roughly where it is, SOL could rally between 35 and 45%, bringing it close to that $300 mark. Given that the Bitcoin halving is just around the corner, it’s likely that BTC’s price will rally though. That means a 35 to 45% gain in SOL versus BTC would bring it above the $300 milestone.”
Source: Coin Bureau/YouTube
Guy goes on to say that four of Solana’s upcoming milestones will also play a key role in whether or not it surges to $300.
“Whether SOL can hit $300 or more depends on Solana’s milestones. The Solana Foundation put out a de facto roadmap back in January which included four milestones. 
The first was the release of token extensions which you’ll recall occurred shortly after in January. The second milestone is the launch of new validator clients, namely Firedancer… the Firedancer client will significantly increase Solana’s speed but it’s not clear by how much… 
The third milestone on Solana’s de facto roadmap is unspecified institutional support. The milestone notes that enterprises now have access to all the tools they need to build on Solana. The fact that Solana’s purpose is to be a decentralized NASDAQ suggests that tokenized real world assets could be coming.” 
The fourth milestone, according to Turner, is the Solana Foundation’s call to developers to make use of all the tools at their disposal to build products and services over Solana.
SOL is trading for $181.55 at time of writing, a 5% decrease during the last 24 hours.

DeFi Protocol Ethena (USDE) Plans to Airdrop Governance Token Next on April 2

The protocol is set to airdrop 750 million ENA tokens, or 5% of the total supply. The campaign to earn "shards," which qualify users for the token airdrop, will end on April 1. Those who unstake, unlock or sell all their USDe before this date will not be eligible for the airdrop.

Not just the halving: Why analysts are bullish on Bitcoin in 2024

The Bitcoin (BTC) halving in April will only be one small part of why the cryptocurrency could see phenomenal gains this year, according to multiple industry analysts.Next month, the Bitcoin halving will reduce daily BTC production by about 450 BTC from the current average daily amount of 900 BTC, investment researcher Lyn Alden told Cointelegraph.However, Alden said the amount of supply cut pales compared to daily fiat flows in and out of crypto exchanges and Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).“In fact, inflows or outflows can easily exceed 10x of that value,” Alden said, adding that overall demand for Bitcoin is a “bigger factor than tightening supply.”Historically, demand for Bitcoin has been more correlated with measures of global liquidity, such as the global broad money supply, Alden stressed, referring to a chart reflecting the BTC price versus global monetary supply (M2).Bitcoin price vs. global liquidity (M2). Source: Look into Bitcoin“So I think the halving is important, but it’s only one factor out of many that determines the occurrence and timing of a bull market. Various measures of global liquidity, HODL waves, and other catalysts combine to serve a larger role,” Alden said, adding:“I am bullish for the next two years due to a combination of the halving, expectations for improved global liquidity, and the fact that so many coins have rotated to strong hands in the bear market, and so a relatively minor increase in demand can move the price quite a bit.”10x Research CEO and head analyst Markus Thielen says the current rally is “undoubtedly on par” with the 2020 and 2021 bull market, which initially peaked in April 2021.Referring to tools like quantitative analysis, Thielen has been bullish on the price of Bitcoin after the cryptocurrency crossed its multi-year highs on March 13, 2024. Based on historical price changes and Bitcoin’s recent new highs, 10x Research projected that Bitcoin would reach $77,000 by early April and $99,000 by May 2024.“When Bitcoin made a new high at $68,300, we saw a wave of intraday selling, but every attempt to push down prices has been met with relentless buying,” Thielen wrote in an email to Cointelegraph on March 14.The analyst noted that each time Bitcoin made new price breakouts in February 2013, February 2017, and November 2020, the price could grow s much as 189% after 180 days. Eventually, Bitcoin would top after nine to 11 months following the breakouts historically, Thielen noted.Bitcoin 90 days after making new bull market highs. Source: 10x ResearchThielen forecasted that between December and February 2025 — or in nine to 11 months following the March 13 breakout — Bitcoin could move to an eye-watering $146,000.“Although corrections and retracements could occur at any time, traders could use the breakout level — $68,300 — as their new line in the sand, where we can argue that above this level, Bitcoin could be materially higher over the next few weeks and months,” the analyst said, adding:“Despite the possibility that Bitcoin could climb to 146,000 this summer, we keep our 125,000 price target for now as we expect this bull market to continue until 2025.”The current Bitcoin rally is the first time Bitcoin has posted a parabolic rise and hit a new all-time high before the block reward halving, eToro crypto analyst Simon Peters emphasized.According to Peters, the main reason for such a breakout is the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the United States on Jan. 11, 2024.“Demand for Bitcoin is fast outstripping the new supply, and this is something we’ve never really had in previous cycles,” Peters stressed. Before the introduction of ETFs, the demand was previously driven mainly by retail, while the ongoing cycle is going to be “more institutional,” he added.According to Peters, Bitcoin miners are the only natural sellers, as they have been actively dumping BTC since August 2023. “This suggests to me that miners have already been selling into the current rally in preparation for the upcoming block reward halving,” the analyst said, adding that all selling is “well bid” because of the high demand from spot ETFs," said Peters, adding: “If we do see a slowdown in spot ETF inflows, this could be an indication of the market topping out and running out of steam, but it’s important to note that whilst the ETFs have been a major contributor to the rally so far, they are not the only participants in the space. Other entities such as MicroStrategy and Bitcoin whales continue to accumulate too.”Meanwhile, Exness financial market strategist Li Xing sees macroeconomic developments driving the Bitcoin price this year. Apart from the spot Bitcoin ETF launch, other economic developments, like expectations of a softer monetary policy and lower interest rates in the U.S. and elsewhere, could boost Bitcoin’s appeal as an alternative store of value, the analyst said.Related: Bitcoin to enter pre-halving ’danger zone,’ but crypto CEOs remain bullish“Moreover, geopolitical risks and uncertainties surrounding the U.S. elections could continue to buoy demand, marking the beginning of a sustained bull run in the future,” Li added.Programmed to occur once per 210,000 blocks or roughly every four years, Bitcoin halvings are designed to maintain Bitcoin’s deficit and counteract inflation.Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has come through three halving events in 2012, 2016 and 2020, cutting its miner incentive from the initial 50 BTC to the current 6.5 BTC. The soon-to-come Bitcoin halving in 2024 will further decrease the mining reward from 6.5 BTC to 3.125 BTC.Historically, Bitcoin halvings have been associated with post-halving rallies. For example, Bitcoin skyrocketed about 3,000% in 17 months after halving in 2016, reaching a historic milestone of $20,000 in December 2017.Magazine: ‘Crypto is inevitable’ so we went ‘all in’: Meet Vance Spencer, permabull

1.3 Billion Dollar Cryptocurrency Project Announces Airdrop Distribution: Here is the Critical Date - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ethena, the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol known for its $1.3 billion USDe token, announced today that it plans to launch its governance token. According to a recent blog post, the token will be introduced to users through an airdrop scheduled for April 2.
The protocol plans to distribute a total of 750 million ENA tokens, representing 5% of the total supply. The “shard” winning campaign, which qualifies users for the token airdrop, will end on April 1. Users who bought back, unlocked or sold all their USDe before this date will not be considered for the airdrop.


Starting the day after the airdrop, users will be able to claim their tokens. ENA will also be listed on centralized exchanges, according to the blog post. Following the airdrop, Ethena will launch a new campaign with additional incentives for the next phase of the airdrop.

Ethena's USDe token, often referred to as a “synthetic dollar”, claims to provide stable returns to investors. This is achieved by using Ethereum (ETH) liquid staking tokens, such as Lido's stETH, as the supporting asset. These are paired with short ETH perpetual futures positions of equal value on derivative exchanges to maintain a “rough target” price of $1. Known as “cash and carry” trading, this strategy uses derivative funding rates to generate returns.





The USDe token has seen significant growth recently, rising from $85 million at the beginning of the year to $1.3 billion.

Blob base fee surges, Ethereum misses slots as ‘BlobScriptions’ go viral - Blockworks


On Wednesday morning, the website Ethscriptions created a way to mint inscriptions on EIP-4844 blobs, which are cost-saving packets of data introduced in Ethereum’s recent Dencun upgrade.
As with other blockchains that have received the inscription treatment, so-called BlobScriptions have heavily driven up the price of blockspace — or in this case, blobspace. 
Since Dencun, the base fee for a blob, or the minimum gas price needed for a blob to be included in the next Ethereum block, has been one wei, an Ethereum-denominated price that is equivalent to a fraction of $0.01. 
Read more: The biggest Ethereum upgrade ever goes live
Today, the blob base fee climbed above 500 gwei, according to ultrasound.money. One gwei is worth a billion wei.
At the time of writing, the blob fee was roughly 6 gwei, marking a 60 trillion percent increase over the one wei blobs cost in the two weeks since Dencun. Six gwei is equal to around $0.20, according to CoinBrain. 
Notably, the much-increased blob fee is still lower than the price of gas on Ethereum’s layer-1, which stands at around 37 gwei, per Etherscan.
Nevertheless, at a price of one wei, blob space was effectively “free,” Blocknative CEO Matt Cutler told Blockworks in a text. “But the current Blob Base Fee is measured in Gwei and that’s far from free.”
Inscriptions — which have seen a resurgence in popularity on Bitcoin in recent months — create an inexpensive means of embedding art or would-be tokens onto a blockchain. In the case of BlobScriptions, a host of pictures and tokens are now being inscribed on blobs.
What’s important to note, however, is that blob data is only kept by Ethereum nodes for roughly 18 days to let layer-2s verify transactions. So after 18 days, BlobScriptions will disappear from Ethereum. But BlobScriptions will still be stored in the indexer for creator protocol Ethscriptions, co-founder Tom Lehman said on X.
Read more: What does EIP 4844 mean for Ethereum rollups?
In the four hours before press time, 41% of created blobs were inscription mints, according to a Dune dashboard. By way of comparison, popular layer-2s Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism each accounted for roughly 9% of blobs in the same time span. 
Lehman told Blockworks his goal in using blobs for inscriptions was to let people get around using expensive smart contracts for data storage. 
“We created Blobscriptions to enable ordinary people — not just giant layer-2s — to benefit from EIP-4844 blobs,” Lehman said in a direct message.
Ethereum also saw an increase in missed slots Wednesday afternoon, though there was disagreement among researchers as to whether the slots were being missed due to blob inscriptions or something else.
Either way, blob inscriptions could impede the low-fee promised land layer-2s have lived in for the past two weeks.
“[Is] this an ephemeral fad or a behavior that is here to stay? Time will tell,” Cutler wrote.

Age-old Cardano debate resurfaces: Which side are you on? - AMBCrypto



A crypto influencer questioned Cardano’s high market value despite lower network utilization.
Cardano’s market cap to TVL ratio was one of the highest in the space.

A crypto influencer enraged the supporters of popular smart contracts chain Cardano [ADA], sparking a heated debate on the network’s fundamentals.
What happened?
In a controversial X (formerly Twitter) post that went viral, MartyParty questioned the rationale behind the ADA token commanding a $23 billion-plus market valuation despite having much less network utilization.
The influencer went one step further by advising his followers to dump the token and shift to a “performing” blockchain token.
These remarks weren’t taken well by the Cardano community, who jumped to counter Marty’s arguments.
Some of them even called the transaction per second (TPS) data highlighted by him as outdated, adding a community note under his post with a link to the updated source.
Not the first time
Over the years, many prominent market observers have trained their guns on Cardano’s network capabilities and the justification behind it having a disproportionately larger market cap.
Just last month, Bitcoin [BTC] advocate and BitMeX co-founder Arthur Hayes threw shades at the network.
The Cardano community has energetically countered these arguments every time, with some questioning the use of TPS metric to gauge the network’s performance.
Others have drawn attention to the technical intricacies of a single transaction on Cardano.
Does the argument hold merit?
AMBCrypto assessed Cardano network through Santiment’s asset valuation metric, NVT Ratio. When compared to Ethereum [ETH], Cardano’s NVT Ratio has been on the lower side in recent months.
This meant that its market valuation was lower than the value being transmitted on the network, in other words an undervalued asset.
Source: Santiment
That being said, Cardano’s DeFi growth has lagged well behind its market cap increase.
As of this writing, its total value locked (TVL)  was just $418 million according to DeFiLlama, significantly lower than chains with similar market caps.

Read Cardano’s [ADA] Price Prediction 2024-25

These findings have led critics to question the network’s potential in building effective decentralized apps (dApps).
Meanwhile, ADA fell 4.5% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.65 as of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap.

XRP Price Enters Pre-Bull Rally Phase: Crypto Analyst Reveals Next Target


                            The XRP price has largely left many of its enthusiasts feeling dissatisfied during this bull cycle, as it has failed to reach the $1 mark despite the bullish sentiment surrounding cryptocurrencies. However, crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO believes a $1 XRP price is still possible in this cycle, as he predicted a price surge in the near term. From this analyst’s technical perspective, recent price action has seen XRP forming a “W” pattern, making it ready for a massive push above $1.
XRP Price Pattern Signals A Potential Massive Move
XRP’s highest price so far this year is $0.718. The cryptocurrency now finds itself perambulating below the $0.65 price level and even falling to as low as $0.57 in the past seven days. This has prompted many investors and holders to feel frustrated and concerned about the poor price performance. 

Despite this lackluster performance, many analysts continue to hold on to a bullish price action for XRP. EGRAG, who is well-known for his bullish attitude on XRP, has, for the most part, encouraged his followers on social media to maintain their positive posture on XRP. His most recent technical analysis, which he shared on social media, indicates that the price formation of XRP has now established a bullish pattern, which has been responsible for significant price increases in the past.
This price spike is particularly based on a peculiar “W” pattern, which he highlighted on a 3-day candlestick chart of the XRP price. Interestingly, a detailed look into the chart shared by EGRAG shows that XRP embarked on the formation of this “W” pattern in July 2023. Now that the formation seems complete, the analyst noted that XRP could potentially surge to $1 on a standard scale and $1.2 on a logarithmic scale.

At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.63. A surge to $1 and $1.2 from the current price level would mean a 58.7% and 90.47% spike respectively. However, EGRAG also noted the possibility of the “W” pattern leading to a downturn. In his price chart, he highlighted a worse case scenario of XRP falling to $0.44518. 
What’s Next For XRP?
EGRAG is one of the many crypto analysts who are still ultra-bullish on XRP’s price trajectory. His long-term price projection for XRP is $27. Other analysts like Mikybull predict XRP can reach as high as $6.

Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC seems to be nearing its end which could mean the end of a prolonged stunted price growth for XRP. As a result, we could see XRP surging to new highs very soon. Whether or not XRP reaches $27 or sets new records, many see it as an undervalued asset with significant upside potential. This fundamental growth could see XRP push to $1 for the first time since November 2021.

Terra Luna Classic's $1 Dream: Is Chain Upgrade the Catalyst? - DailyCoin


        
Smoothly executed Hard Fork on Terra Luna Classic chain restores optimism.



Terra members greet the devs as LUNC reaches for a $1 billion market cap.



Terra Classic holder count mounted to a new all-time high at 5.52 million.
The Terra Luna Classic community is celebrating a breakthrough in further developing the game-tested blockchain. According to the pre-accepted governance proposal #12090, Terra Classic’s Layer-1 chain at block height 17309000 was supposed to kick in on March 25, disconnecting the chain briefly.This chain upgrade v2.4.2 brings highly-awaited improvements to the Layer-1 chain, including IBC-Hooks, which are crucial for the seamless integration of new decentralized applications (dApps) on the network, such as Enterprise DAO. As the Hard Fork procedure went smoothly, this has sparked the Terra Classic community’s optimism regarding LUNC.After completing the crucial Hard Fork, Genuine Labs, the developer team responsible for a smooth transition into the upgraded chain version, published a bi-weekly report confirming that the chain upgrade is implemented. As Terra Classic validators gradually returned online, community members greeted Genuine Labs for their great work.Terra Luna Classic’s $1 Dream Comes Closer?The smooth operation of v.2.4.2 post-upgrade has planted optimism among Terra Classic’s community members. Crypto chart analyst Crypto Anu insisted that this new chain upgrade adds extra security measures to Terra Classic’s chain via The Terra Classic Security Package, which is due for completion in eight weeks.Moreover, the recent upgrades have bumped the total LUNC holder count to 5.52 million, signaling long-term investor interest in this digital asset. Encouraged to contribute to LUNC burns, the community has set aflame to 105 billion LUNC tokens, leaving 5.8T Terra Classic tokens in circulation.Terra Luna Classic ranks just #124, struggling to keep itself relevant among newly-emerged competing altcoins and memecoins. However, the 35% surge over the past month has brought optimism to its community as it continues to task itself with Terra Luna’s chain revitalization plan. Spearheaded to $1, LUNC would still be far from its all-time high set at $119 on April 5, 2022.On the Flipside
The recent LUNC price surge is partly attributable to the recent legal developments of Do Kwon’s release.



Terra Luna chain’s creator has been released from jail in Montenegro with a pending extradition status.



Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission initiated the TerraForm Labs trial for market manipulation.
Why This MattersOnce a TOP 5 blockchain by global market capitalization, Terra Luna Classic still hosts a vibrant community of developers and crypto enthusiasts aiming to restore a part of its former glory.

Top 4 Altcoins Poised for New All-Time Highs This April


March was an exceptional month for the crypto market as investors witnessed Bitcoin prices hitting all-time highs as well as the rise of multiple major altcoins. However, despite the bullishness, some altcoins missed the mark.
These altcoins will likely print new all-time highs in the coming month of April, when the second quarter of 2024 begins.
SUI Will Be the First to Shatter the Record
Sui is the altcoin in the top 100 cryptocurrencies list that is the closest to printing a new all-time high. The altcoin made an attempt last month but failed only to witness a 21% rise in the past 48 hours. This rally has brought it closer to the previous high of $2.10, witnessed back in May 2023.
SUI/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView
The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator measuring the speed and change of price movements, is also in the bullish zone. This suggests that the digital asset is not yet overbought and could cross $2.10 by the beginning of April.

Aptos (APT) Bull Run Continues
Aptos price rose from the low of $9 to nearly double in value as the altcoin can be seen changing hands at $18.6 at the moment. This rally will only continue as we move into Q2, given APT is less than 12.5% away from breaching the previous all-time high of $20.40 from January 2023.
APT/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a trend-following momentum indicator that is used to identify bullish and bearish trends, is also signaling growth. The indicator is continuing the bullish crossover uptrend, which will drive APT higher.

BNB Price Set to Initiate a Recovery
BNB is currently on a short-term incline, inching closer to the $691 ATH. The Binance native token is about 18.14% away from the price point, which would require BNB to close above the $600 mark first.

BNB/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView
Although MACD and RSI are both noting a downtick right now, they aren’t highlighting bearish trends. As long as BNB stays above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the coin will have a shot at recovery, which will likely take place in April.
Arbitrum (ARB) Will Need a Push
Unlike other altcoins in this list, Arbitrum’s price noted its all-time high earlier this year back in January 2024. The cryptocurrency, however, noted significant correction since then, bringing the price down to $1.69.

ARB/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView
The all-time high is now 42% away from the token, and ARB would need to flip the 50 and 100-day EMA in order to make it to $2. This support level will provide the boost necessary to rally on towards $2.40.

MACD indicates that a bullish crossover is imminent, suggesting that the uptrend momentum will reignite soon.

BOOK OF MEME Advances Rapidly In Trading Volume - BOME Bulls Look To Outperform Shiba Inu ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
In the crypto world, new projects frequently emerge and battle for attention and market share. One newcomer making waves in the market is Book Of Meme (BOME), a cryptocurrency that has recently captured the spotlight with its impressive increase in trading volume and price. BOME has even gotten close to the trading volume of Shiba Inu. With BOME’s rapid pump, everyone is eager to know what lies ahead for this memecoin.



BOME’s Recent Rise



In the last 24 hours, BOME experienced a remarkable pump in its price and trading volume, showing increased interest from traders and investors. BOME increased by 6.4% in price and 13.4% in trading volume, totalling an impressive $1.5 billion. This surge in trading activity has put BOME ahead of Shiba Inu, a cryptocurrency often dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer,” which recorded a trading volume of $1.2 billion over the same period.



This buzz surrounding BOME is happening due to several factors, such as listings on major crypto exchanges.



In addition to the listings, BOME’s derivatives data shows further optimism among investors. A notable 30% rise in volume and open interest reaching $143.4 million suggest strong demand for the memecoin. Specifically, over the last 24 hours, traders have been even more active as the number of liquidations has risen, mostly coming from long positions.



What’s Next for BOME?



Prominent crypto technical analyst Kyledoops has also weighed in on BOME’s potential, suggesting that the coin’s breakout from resistance levels has settled at a good support level. This move and its strength in testing these levels hint at a possible sustained pump. The analyst’s sentiments reflect the optimism around BOME as it continues to climb through the crypto rankings.

&nbsp



As BOME continues to challenge established players in the crypto space, there are still questions about its long-term stability. Will BOME emerge as a powerful contender, maintaining its momentum and gaining substantial market share, or will it become a victim of volatility and fall off like most meme coins?

What to expect at Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencing hearing

On March 28, former FTX CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried will face a judge and learn whether his time in federal prison is ending or just beginning following his conviction on seven felony charges.Judge Lewis Kaplan will hear from prosecutors and SBF’s attorneys in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for one of the last times the former FTX CEO will appear in person as part of his criminal case. The sentencing hearing will likely conclude the matter, which started with the collapse of FTX in November 2022 and continued with Bankman-Fried’s arrest, extradition, trial and conviction.Source: Will RobbinsIn November 2023, a jury found SBF guilty of charges that included wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud and money laundering. The former CEO’s lawyers were the first to file a sentencing recommendation, suggesting that SBF serve 6.5 years in prison for his actions that led to FTX investors losing access to millions of dollars. The seven felony counts carry a maximum allowable sentence of 110 years. Prosecutors recommended Bankman-Fried serve between 40 and 50 years to “reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s crimes,” but the decision will come down to Judge Kaplan’s interpretation of the case and consideration of the victims and affected parties.“I think you’re going to see a sentence of, I’m going to handicap about 30 years, is what I think [SBF] will get — maybe more,” Mark Bini, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York and current partner at law firm Reed Smith, told Cointelegraph. “There’s a big dispute between the government and the defense about the loss number here — what is the actual amount that was lost, because that’s a big driver of the guidelines.”Bini said the sentencing guidelines would require Judge Kaplan to consider the amount lost at the time of the collapse of FTX rather than any repayment plan the firm has proposed in bankruptcy proceedings. One proposed plan would reimburse FTX users in fiat for their lost crypto based on prices in November 2022 — many have pointed out that this would cause them to miss out on recent surges in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens.“My whole life has been destroyed,” said one unidentified FTX user with two children in a victim impact statement to the court. “I did not agree to the risk that SBF took with my funds.”Source: Tiffany FongRelated: Crypto users weigh in on Sam Bankman-Fried’s prison time ahead of sentencing memoBankman-Fried’s case is mainly new ground regarding a high-profile figure from the digital asset space going through a full trial and being convicted and sentenced. Ross Ulbricht, creator of the Silk Road marketplace, was sentenced to two life sentences without the possibility of parole in 2015. Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, was sentenced to more than 11 years for exaggerating or falsifying claims about the firm’s blood-testing technology.In the crypto world, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has pleaded guilty to one felony count related to failure to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at the crypto exchange and is scheduled to be sentenced in April. Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky, charged with defrauding and misleading customers, is set to go to trial in September.“I don’t think that we’ll see [CZ’s] case impacted that much because they’re very different types,” said Bini. “The Mashinsky case, it could have big consequences because you’ve got the same defense attorney who’s now representing SBF and both of those being in the Southern District of New York. They’re not exactly the same, but [...] certainly Mashinsky will be watching.”Bankman-Fried’s sentencing is scheduled to begin at 9:30 am ET in New York on March 28, his first appearance in court since waiving a potential conflict of interest for his lawyers. It’s unclear if SBF’s family will be in attendance.Magazine: ‘Less flashy’ Mashinsky set for less jail time than SBF: Inner City Press, X Hall of Flame

Kucoin, In Trouble With Lawsuits In The US, Announces That It Will Distribute 10 Million Dollar Airdrop To Its Users - Bitcoin Sistemi

Cryptocurrency prices experienced a significant decline yesterday following the accusations made against the KuCoin cryptocurrency exchange by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.
The charges, which included violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and unlicensed money transfer crimes, led to a significant outflow of assets from the exchange.


According to the statement made by the CFTC, a civil lawsuit was filed in New York Court against Mek Global Limited, PhoenixFin PTE Ltd, Flashdot Limited and Peken Global Limited. These entities collectively operate KuCoin, a centralized digital asset exchange, and have been charged with multiple violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.
Following these accusations, onchain analysis and intelligence company Nansen reported that a total of $1.7 billion in crypto assets were withdrawn from this exchange. In the last 24 hours, there has been an outflow of over $842 million in Ethereum and $938 million in EVM chains from an initial asset level of $6 billion, representing a more than 15% decline in assets held by the exchange.






In response to these developments, KuCoin announced a $10 million airdrop to its users. KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu thanked all KuCoin users for their support and trust over the past seven years. Lyu acknowledged that some users experienced longer-than-expected wait times when making withdrawals on March 26 and 27, and apologized for this.
According to its official statement, KuCoin will launch a special airdrop event worth a total of $10 million in KCS and BTC to express their deep gratitude for user support and patience. “We hope that through this initiative we can express our gratitude for the support of our loyal users,” Lyu said.


According to the official announcement, the rules of the airdrop event will be officially announced within three days.

Solana-based WEN erases losses: Time for another hike? - AMBCrypto



Sentiment around WEN was positive as trading volume increased.
The 4-hour analysis suggested a possible climb toward $0.00088.

WEN, the cat-themed meme coin built on Solana [SOL], has seen its price increase by an incredible 29.10% in the last 24 hours. Like the price, the trading volume of WEN also jumped.
At press time, the volume was $345.71 million, hinting at increased interest in the token. Before, its recent decrease to $0.00049, the price of WEN climbed to $0.00051.
This value represented the highest point it had reached within the last month.
The cat has a bull’s eye
AMBCrypto’s investigation into the reasons for the unprecedented hike provided some insights. According to our findings, Crypto.com’s listing of WEN was one reason for the hike.
Not many centralized exchanges have the coin listed.
So, when the exchange announced the listing on the 26th of March, demand for the token soared. WEN is one of the meme coin that has launched on Solana in the last six months.
Although, it does not have the Bonk [BONK] and dogwifhat [WIF] kind of hype yet, on-chain data showed many market participants have kept an eye on it.
According to Santiment, WEN’s social volume jumped to 156 on the 26th of March. The hike was proof that attention in the market shifted to the Solana-based token.
When AMBCrypto checked the Weighted Sentiment, we noticed that the metric soared. At press time, the Weighted Sentiment had skyrocketed to 1.25, indicating a bullish perception around the token.
Source: Santiment
If sentiment remains bullish in the coming days, the price of WEN might increase further. However, traders might need to be wary of profit-taking.
In a case where selling pressure increases, the possible rise beyond $0.00051 might be disproved.
WEN targets the moon
However, it is also important to look at the price potential from a technical angle. As of this writing, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour WEN/USD pair showed the token was overbought.
In this state, it is expected that WEN’s price might retrace. If the price declines, the value of the token might pull back as low as $0.00037 (the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level).
Despite the possible decline, our analysis showed that the price of WEN might extend to $0.00088 (the 4.238 Fib level). However, the possible jump to $0.00088 might not happen immediately.
In addition, indications from the Awesome Oscillator (AO) showed that WEN could continue its upward movement. At press time, the AO reading was positive, indicating increasing bullish momentum.

In the short term, WEN’s value might decrease below $0.00049. However, a possible memecoin season might be close.
When this begins, the cryptocurrency might be one of the tokens that could display an exceptional performance. For the time being, traders might be on the lookout for good entries.

Blast dapp hack was an inside job, and it could have been worse - Blockworks


Munchables, a GameFi project built on Blast, reported late Tuesday that it was “compromised” to the tune of $62 million.
A further $25 million was spared in a related vault of Juice Finance due to an apparent typo.
By blacklisting the hacker’s address, the network was able to seal off the funds, and convince the attacker to give up the controlling private keys.
And that’s not all that’s unusual.
On-chain evidence provided by investigator ZachXBT indicates that the culprit went by a variety of pseudonyms.
“Four different devs hired by the Munchables team and linked to the exploiter are likely all the same person,” he wrote on X following the incident.
Read more: $80M lost in first hack of 2024
Users of Juice Finance, which designed a vault and bot system to play the game and earn valuable points at an accelerated rate, were also at risk, according to Chief Operating Officer Eric Ryklin. 
The Juice team independently reviewed Munchables’ code, a prerequisite for launching its own product.
“The malicious exploit was not in their code,” Ryklin told Blockworks. “Nor is it in their actual audit itself.”
“This guy pushed an upgrade that no one could have seen — it was unverified — and it essentially gave him three wallets that had unlimited access to withdraw funds, plus he had the keys to the upgrader and the main deployer wallet,” he said.
Read more: Latest DeFi exploits show audits are no guarantee
Juice and Munchables shared several investors, and both teams were in touch with each other regularly in the runup to the theft, Ryklin said. The malicious actor, who worked for Munchables, was a member of a group chat that included the Juice team.
“They met this guy in a developer Discord somewhere across the space,” Ryklin recalled, and after the hack it emerged that the team was not the actual owner of their contracts.
“Someone from their HR team messed up big time,” blockchain security firm SlowMist said on X.
Ryklin described it as a “sleeper cell,” and ZachXBT pointed to North Korean hackers as likely responsible.
“This guy inserted three sleeper wallets into the actual contract that no one could find at first,” Ryklin said. “But the second that he would do a transaction, that sleeper wallet would become public, so the Blast sequencer could essentially blacklist him.”
ZachXBT declined to comment on how he arrived at that conclusion. 
A spokesperson for security firm CertiK told Blockworks “it’s highly unusual that the funds were then returned to the project from a malicious DPRK affiliated worker” — referring to agents of the North Korean government — and that the firm assessed it could be “a rogue developer,” who, with their identity revealed, “decided to give the funds back after pressure from the Web3 community to prevent further backlash.”
“Obviously, seeing the funds returned is abnormal behavior,” ZachXBT told Blockworks.
In any case, quickly recognizing those wallets proved crucial to securing the return of the stolen funds.

With the jig up, and no way to exfiltrate the funds, the attacker made it easier on the Blast team by handing over their private keys.
That avoided the need to employ more technical solutions.
“Blast could have definitely pushed a soft fork to literally just blacklist his wallet and pull the money out,” Ryklin said, “I think at that point, it’s like, ‘Why would he not give the keys back?’”
The hacker was not able to take 7349.99 wrapped ether, worth about $25 million at the time, as a result of an apparent typo. It was what Juice’s auditor, Trust Security, called “one of the weirdest side stories of the Munchables exploit.”
Instead of snatching all the wrapped ether, the attacker took just 73.49 wETH (about $267,000).
“The hacker was off by two 0s when inputting the amount! It is easy to confirm in a simulation that they could have indeed taken the whole vault,” Trust said. “It must have taken the hacker over eight minutes to realize their mistake, which is when the team paused withdrawals.”
CertiK confirmed to Blockworks this was the most plausible explanation for the data.
None of Juice’s other vaults or its own smart contracts were affected, the team said.
The hacker also missed the chance to grab an additional $7 million in USDB, Blast’s interest bearing stablecoin, which was secured before it could be stolen, Ryklin said.
“The bridges got closed, so the money was contained,” he said.
That meant that, unlike in other hacking cases, the thief had no leverage. The fact that Blast has multiple centralized components meant that there would be no chance to try to launder the proceeds.

That may trouble some “decentralization maxis,” but Ryklin finds it completely normal at this stage of the network’s development.
“I think the reason that you were able to successfully recover $97 million instead of everyone losing their money is because there are guardrails in place, and I don’t think those are the worst things in the world,” he said.

Can Solana’s Decaf App Bring the Unbanked to Crypto? - DailyCoin


        
Decaf uses Solana to make financial services accessible in over 184 currencies. 



Stablecoin transfers offer a safeguard against inflation.



Decaf simplifies the transition from fiat to crypto. 
The global financial landscape is marked by pronounced disparities, with access to stable and reliable financial services remaining out of reach for significant portions of the world’s population. In regions plagued by economic instability, residents often face the dual challenges of inflation and limited access to traditional banking systems.In light of these challenges, blockchain technology has been heralded for its potential to offer alternative solutions. Among the initiatives emerging in this space is Decaf, a digital wallet built on the Solana blockchain, which aims to mitigate some of these financial disparities. How Decaf Uses Solana to Onboard Unbanked to CryptoOn Tuesday, March 26, the Solana Foundation featured Decaf, a mobile payment app, in its “Only Possible on Solana” series. Co-founded by Fernanda Orduña Rangel, Decaf targets the issues people face in unstable and underdeveloped economies.Decaf lets users easily convert their assets between 184 fiat currencies and various cryptocurrencies. The platform has also integrated with Moneygram locations globally, enabling users to redeem crypto for fiat at over 350,000 locations worldwide. Critically, due to its support for stablecoins like USDC, the platform offers a stable alternative in countries experiencing significant inflation. This means it enables people in affected countries to preserve their savings in an economic crisis. Can Solana Apps Onboard the Unbanked to Crypto? The potential for technological solutions to the problems of the unbanked is there, and Solana, with its high-performance blockchain, presents a fertile ground for applications that aim to address this. However, crucial factors need to be considered. 



In many regions, particularly in Africa and Asia, mobile payment apps like M-Pesa, Paytm, and GCash have significantly impacted financial inclusion. These platforms have successfully onboarded millions of users by providing essential financial services. Blockchain-based apps like Decaf will have to compete with these apps. To do so, they require ease of use and a strong infrastructure. What is more, regulatory environments in these countries need to be conducive to blockchain solutions. On the Flipside
In some emerging markets, there is still considerable ambiguity or even hostility towards crypto, which could hinder operations and user adoption of crypto apps.



Blockchain technology cannot single-handedly rectify the complex economic and political issues contributing to financial instability and inequality. 
Why This MattersThe deployment of Decaf on Solana represents an important validation of blockchain’s potential in real-world use cases. It also reinforces Solana’s position as a leading platform for developing scalable and accessible financial applications.

BREAKING: BlackRock's Cryptocurrency-Friendly CEO Larry Fink is Speaking Live - Here Are His Remarks - Bitcoin Sistemi


Larry Fink, who was once an enemy of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and is now one of the biggest pro-cryptocurrency names with his applications for Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETF, is making statements on Fox Business live broadcast.
We will constantly update and share Larry Fink's statements regarding the cryptocurrency market and the US economy here.



Larry Fink announced that he is bullish on Bitcoin in the long term.
Larry Fink: “Look, I'm very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin. We're now producing a market with more liquidity and more transparency, and I'm very surprised by that, and I would never have predicted that before.”
Spot Bitcoin ETFs are the fastest growing ETFs in ETF history.
FOX reporter Charles Gasparino asked Fink a question about Ethereum: “There is a lot of buzz about the SEC declaring a security that would remove Ethereum from the category of its Bitcoin counterpart as a commodity. How would this be reflected in an ETF?” Fink answered the question this way: “I don't think so, look, and I can't really talk about it, but I don't think that characterization would be that harmful.” Gasparino: “So you can launch an ETH ETF even if it is a security?” Fink: “I guess so, yeah.”

BlackRock submitted its Ethereum ETF application in November and was included in the latest postponements by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The financial regulator's biggest concern may be the staking feature of the network.

U.S. Treasury Department Targets 13 Russian Firms Allegedly Offering Crypto-Related Services To Avoid Sanctions - The Daily Hodl


								The US Government has named entities and individuals allegedly responsible for providing crypto products and services that aided in the evasion of sanctions on Russia.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) says that it has “sanctioned thirteen entities and two individuals for operating in the financial services and technology sectors of the Russian Federation economy.”










According to the agency, many of the designated individuals and entities “facilitated transactions or offered other services that helped OFAC-designated entities evade sanctions.”
Among the designated entities include the Moscow-based fintech firm B-Crypto, which OFAC accuses of partnering with Rosbank to enable Russian exporters to make cross-border payments using crypto assets. Rosbank is a Russian commercial bank that is also under US sanctions.
Other designated entities are Moscow-based fintech firms Masterchain, Laitkhaus, and Atomaiz. Peer-to-peer crypto exchange Bitpapa and centralized digit asset exchange Crypto Explorer were also sanctioned.
Firms based outside Russia that were sanctioned include Eastern European companies such as the Cyprus-based Tokentrust Holdings and the Estonia-based Bitfingroup.
Blockchain technology firms Veb3 Integrator and Veb3 Tekhnologii as well as fintech firm TOEP which operates a crypto exchange were also placed on the list of entities supporting the evasion of sanctions by Russian firms and individuals. The two firms are based in Moscow.
The two sanctioned individuals are Igor Veniaminovich Kaigorodov, the majority shareholder of Veb3 Integrator and Veb3 Tekhnologii and Timur Evgenyevich Bukanov, the owner and director of TOEP.
While some of America’s economic and trade sanctions on Russia have existed for decades, some of the most severe ones were placed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022.
Last year in May, it was reported that the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance was being investigated by US authorities over possible violation of sanctions on Russia.

Invest In Altcoins Now Or Wait? What Experts Say Might Surprise You - Emeren Group (NYSE:SOL) - Benzinga

Altcoin Sherpa, a popular analyst, shared an optimistic outlook on the altcoin market. On X, the cryptocurrency commentator pointed to the consolidation pattern in the chart of Render RNDR/USD, a project focused on decentralized GPU rendering. He noted the similarity of this pattern to “a lot of good charts,” suggesting a potential breakout for RNDR and potentially other altcoins in the near future.“RNDR: you know, a lot of good charts have this same type of price action,” Altcoin Sherpa said. “I think now is a great time to scale into many altcoins that you like and just sit on them. The next leg seems like it’s going to come in the next few weeks.”SolanaAltcoin Sherpa also offered his insights on Solana SOL/USD, a major Ethereum competitor. He believes SOL could experience a price dip before a potential rally.“SOL: I think this remains a good area to buy and scale in,” he said. “Would DCA (dollar cost average) from here to $140 personally.” Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where investors buy a fixed amount of an asset at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. Here, Altcoin Sherpa suggests buying SOL gradually as the price potentially dips towards $140.In another tweet, Altcoin Sherpa expressed bullish sentiment towards RSS3 RSS/USD, a decentralized information processing protocol. He believes RSS3 is currently consolidating and poised for a price increase.“RSS3 is consolidating here in my opinion,” he stated. “I think the next leg is coming. In this one personally and have a node. Bullish.”Also Read: Can You Make Millions In Minutes? This Trader Found Out The Hard WayPentoshi Cautions On Short-Term Altcoin PerformanceNot all analysts share Altcoin Sherpa’s immediate optimism. Crypto analyst Pentoshi took a more cautious stance on altcoins in the short term. While acknowledging the long-term bullish trend, Pentoshi believes a pullback and consolidation period might be imminent for altcoins.“First bearish post in a very long time,” Pentoshi said.“This is only a short term view,” Pentoshi said. “Not high time frame. But I do believe we likely see the market pull back again and then consolidate in terms of alts.”Pentoshi clarified that he doesn’t advocate for exiting positions entirely. Rather, he suggests having stablecoins ready to capitalize on potential buying opportunities that might arise during a pullback.“I don’t think it’s worth ‘exiting positions,'” he said. “But more just haven’t stables ready for opportunities that may present themselves. The trend is clearly up on all time frames.”What’s Next: With the Bitcoin halving only weeks away, its impact on the altcoin market will be monitored by traders and investors alike.These topics are expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Coinbase Legal Setback: Court Rejects Motion To Dismiss SEC’s Securities AllegationsImage: Shutterstock

There Are Now 11 Bitcoin ETFs Trading as One More Launches - Decrypt

Crypto asset management Hashdex announced on Tuesday that it launched its Bitcoin ETF on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the eleventh Bitcoin ETF to go live since the SEC approved the bulk of fund applications in January.Hashdex's entry originally launched in September 2022 as a Bitcoin Futures ETF trading on the New York Stock Exchange as DEFI. The Brazil-based firm said it had converted that product to a spot Bitcoin ETF to offer investors more immediate exposure to the number one cryptocurrency.Unlike other spot Bitcoin ETFs, however, Hashdex launched its product within the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). And the new fund will continue to incorporate Bitcoin futures.“Going forward and under normal market conditions, the fund’s investment policy is to maximize its holdings of physical Bitcoin such that it is expected that at least 95% of the fund’s assets will be invested in spot Bitcoin,” Hashdex said. “Up to 5% of the fund’s remaining assets may be invested in CME-traded Bitcoin futures contracts and in cash and cash equivalents.”A Bitcoin Futures ETF refers to investments in futures contracts that offer indirect Bitcoin exposure, whereas a spot Bitcoin ETF holds actual Bitcoin, providing direct market price exposure.Hashdex says the Bitcoin ETF holds 5,500 Bitcoins, currently worth around $377.2 million.The spot Bitcoin ETF is sponsored by Tidal ETF Services, Hashdex said, which serves as the fund’s administrator along with BitGo, which acts as the custodian of the Bitcoin underpinning the ETF.“We are thrilled to complete the conversion of DEFI and, with it, deliver an innovative product in coordination with Tidal that furthers our mission of empowering individuals and institutions around the world to access this revolutionary innovation,” Hashdex co-founder and CEO Marcelo Sampaio said in a statement.In January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ten spot Bitcoin ETFs from investment firms, including BlackRock, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, and ARK 21 Shares.While Hashdex did file a Bitcoin ETF application with the SEC, the regulatory agency was still reviewing the final registration statement when the other firms' applications were approved in January, delaying the company’s launch plans.“DEFI originally received its 19b-4 approval first alongside other issuers, and this latest announcement is regarding the product going effective and converting from a futures to a spot Bitcoin ETF,” a Hashdex spokesperson told Decrypt. “To that end, its tracking of a new benchmark index became effective today, March 27, 2024.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Litecoin ETF Rumors Swirl After Multiple CFTC Nods - DailyCoin


        
The Bitcoin ETFs have been hugely successful.



Rumors of a Litecoin ETF grow louder.



Some believe altcoin ETF approval is inevitable.
The arrival of Bitcoin ETFs in January ushered in a watershed moment for the crypto industry, with billions of dollars flowing into the leading cryptocurrency since. Analysts widely credit this Wall Street embrace as the driving force behind Bitcoin’s recent bull run to new all-time highs. Hot on the heels of this resounding success, whispers about institutions gearing up for a Litecoin ETF are growing louder.Litecoin ETF RumorsFueling the speculation is a recent tweet from Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, who claimed to have heard “rumblings on the institutional level” about growing interest in Litecoin ETFs. According to Terrett, the rationale behind this stems from Litecoin’s “functional similarities” to Bitcoin, making it a safer proposition for Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) approval versus an Ethereum ETF.Lending further weight to this narrative is Coinbase’s recent announcement of plans to launch Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-approved futures contracts for Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. Terrett inferred that this regulatory green light from the CFTC suggests that authorities view these cryptocurrencies as legitimate tokens.Further bolstering the case for Litecoin’s regulatory standing is the recent Department of Justice lawsuit against the KuCoin exchange. According to reports, the CFTC explicitly classified Litecoin and Ethereum as commodities in the legal proceedings, adding ammunition to the argument that Litecoin is a viable candidate for an ETF product.While the regulatory stance appears to favor Litecoin as a commodity, opinions remain divided on the potential trajectory and long-term implications of an altcoin ETF frenzy.Are Altcoin ETFs the Next Big Thing? Weighing in on the prospects of a wave of altcoin ETFs coming to market, Luke Martin posed a thought-provoking question during a recent Stacks podcast, asking why Wall Street would stop at Bitcoin ETFs, especially considering their runaway success.



3AC co-founder Su Zhu agreed with Martin, stating that altcoin ETFs are inevitable as the SEC “won’t want to fight fights it can’t win.” However, Zhu tempered his outlook, suggesting that while initial altcoin ETF launches may experience a significant pump, akin to the cannabis stock frenzy, the effect could dissipate for latecomers as the novelty wears off and market dynamics shift. On the Flipside
The odds of an Ethereum ETF being approved were slashed to 25% owing to renewed doubts about ETH‘s securities status.



A token’s commodity status is not necessarily an automatic green light for ETF approval.



Investor appetite for a Litecoin ETF remains speculative at this stage, with institutions‘ actual appetite yet to be determined.
Why This MattersThe prospect of a Litecoin ETF holds immense significance. An SEC-approved product would legitimize Litecoin as a mainstream investment asset, potentially drawing billions in institutional capital to catalyze widespread adoption and cement Litecoin’s position in the crypto hierarchy, which has been on the wane in recent years.The Litecoin Foundation comments on LTC’s lagging price action.

Bitcoin market analysis: Grayscale report signals bull run continuation

The last market description from Grayscale shows that Bitcoin (BTC ) is in the middle of a bull run right now. The latest report from Grayscale supports the strong sentiment of the crypto due to both the fundamental and technical factors that are currently ongoing.Precursors of bull marketGrayScale’s research identifies a few causes that usually act as a beacon that triggers the commencement of a bullish trend. The dominance of Bitcoin, for instance, can be traced as preceding the cryptocurrency market movement as a whole. Initially, a bull run in BTC would bring altcoins out of hibernation in search of higher yields as traders look for the next opportunity. This phenomenon was observed during the 2021-2022 bull upswing, where a significant uptick followed Bitcoin’s predominating rise in altcoins increase in their valuations.Considering past developments and the three key catalysts that differ from the current market cycle, Grayscale employers can expect astounding characteristics in the crypto space. The key background is related to BTC ETFs but positive stablecoin inflows and a drop in BTC balance on exchanges.Spot Bitcoin ETF inflowsThis trend commenced immediately after the spot Bitcoin ETFs were passed in January and extends to the present time, when the inflow of capital into the funds surpassed BTC emission, with upward movement seen in the prices. This pushes the institutional capital inflow as the key component that has shifted market dynamics tremendously from previous investment rounds.Although stablecoin investment, as seen by the growing funds in the reserve of crypto exchanges, has contributed to the influx of capital, generally, “stablecoins in the crypto market are believed to be vehicles for capital inflow, particularly during a bull market.” Also, a declining BTC held on the exchange hand in hand with subsequent transfers to custodian cold wallets for more storage confirms a strong supply-demand setup that fosters the price rise.Grayscale, on the threshold of the knowledge, employs Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) for its assessment of the particular stock market stage. It proposes that the market is in the “mid-phase” or “fifth inning” phase of the current bull run. The NUPL ratio is comprehensive enough to display the climax of this cycle, but the overall market outlook is still on the grey side compared to previous peaks.Retail investor participationStatements and Google Trends analytics show that the passion of the retail investor Bitcoin has still not reached the level typical for 2021. Conversely, though the sentiment analysis shows a similar expression to the one of the last bull market hydra, it implies the possibility of the retail investors returning.Grayscale summarises that the draw run is probably to last, whereas they record favorable market patterns and the constant interest of investors. Nevertheless, they are encouraged to watch the Bitcoin ETF spot flow and look for any macroeconomic developments or signals of a market shift.Although progress has been posted lately, Grayscale is confident space exists for protracted amelioration. Going forward in this novel field, participants` attentiveness and calculated orientation will be critical in managing the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies markets.

US Lawmakers Urge SEC to Confront Prometheum's Custody Plans for ETH


																United States House Financial Services Committee and House Agriculture Committee members have expressed notable concerns regarding the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approach to managing Ethereum (ETH).
The focus of their apprehension centers on crypto firm Prometheum’s plans to offer institutional custody services for ETH, which has sparked several demands for clarity and action from regulatory authorities.
Regulatory Ambiguity
In a letter addressed to SEC Chair Gary Gensler dated March 26, prominent lawmakers, including House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry and Vice Chair French Hill, urged the Commission to confront Prometheum’s intentions to provide custody services for ETH through its subsidiary, Prometheum Capital.
They warned that such actions could have serious and potentially irreversible implications for the digital asset markets. The lawmakers’ concerns revolve around the ambiguity surrounding the SEC’s stance on Special Purpose Broker-Dealers (SPBD) and their ability to custody non-security digital assets like ETH.
Despite previous assertions by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) recognizing ETH as a non-security digital asset, questions linger regarding the regulatory classification and allowed activities within the existing framework.






The letter highlights the lack of clarity in the SEC’s rule concerning SPBD custody of non-securities and the agency’s apparent inactivity in addressing potential non-compliance issues within this matter.
Lawmakers also expressed concern over the absence of comprehensive guidance or a defined regulatory framework for digital asset securities, increasing uncertainty within the digital asset space.
Lawmakers Demand Clarity on ETH
Furthermore, the lawmakers draw attention to Chairman Gensler’s reluctance to definitively classify ETH, which has only increased the confusion surrounding its regulatory treatment. Despite previous acknowledgments of ETH as a non-security digital asset, the SEC’s failure to provide unquestionable clarity has left market participants dealing with uncertainty.
The result of the SEC’s stance extends beyond regulatory ambiguity, potentially impacting the broader digital asset marketplace. Lawmakers warn that classifying ETH as a digital asset security could disrupt existing commodity futures markets and imperil essential risk management tools, ultimately stifling innovation and market growth.
The letter concludes with a call to action, urging the SEC to promptly address the concerns raised and provide much-needed clarity on the regulatory treatment of ETH. Failure to do so, lawmakers warn, risks undermining the integrity and competitiveness of U.S. digital asset markets, with far-reaching consequences for investors and market participants alike.

Sam Bankman-Fried is pushing for lenient jail time ahead of his sentencing Thursday by submitting several letters of support to the court.
                        Sam Bankman-Fried’s legal team has submitted several last-minute letters of support for the disgraced FTX founder in hopes of leniency at his March 28 sentencing, court documents filed Wednesday reveal.Supportive Pleas Surface as Sam Bankman-Fried Awaits Sentence
Spanning from Sam Bankman-Fried’s friends from MIT to parents with children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the latest letters addressed to Judge Lewis A. Kaplan go as far as to call the FTX founder a “kind” and “wonderful person.”“The hope that customer funds will be reimbursed in some measure mitigates the severity of Sam’s guilt, and it seems the length of his sentence should reflect this fact,” the parent of an FTX customer who lost their life savings on the doomed crypto exchange wrote.“Though I have never met Sam, I firmly believe that while he may be an MIT grad – he did not fully understand the scope of what was going on and did not have malicious intent,” said a mother of a son with ASD.Sam Bankman-Fried is facing a potential maximum penalty of over 100 years in federal prison following his November 2023 whirlwind trial that saw the FTX founder convicted on seven different fraud charges.His lawyers have since requested a maximum prison sentence of six years for orchestrating the $8 billion digital asset fraud, citing his ASD and “genuine concern” for others.Prosecution Counters with Strong Rebuke to SBF’s Support Letters
Shortly after Bankman-Fried’s legal team filed additional letters on the FTX founder’s behalf pushing for leniency on Wednesday, prosecutors submitted their own court filings in the form of additional victim impact statements.“My whole life has been destroyed,” one FTX depositor wrote, stating that he “did not agree to the risk that Sam Bankman-Fried took” with his funds.“Sam Bankman-Fried’s callous disregard for the impact of his actions on individuals like myself, who have diligently worked to build a future, is reprehensible and deserving of maximum sentencing,” wrote another.How Long Will Bankman-Fried Get In Prison?While Bankman-Fried is facing hefty prison time for his role in FTX’s ultimate collapse, the actual length of his sentence will largely be under the discretion of Judge Kaplan and the court’s recommended guidelines.“Kaplan’s tough – and he has that reputation – but he’s not nasty,” former U.S. assistant attorney and white-collar crime expert Kevin J. O’Brien said in an interview with Cryptonews. “I don’t think he’s effectively going to put the guy away for the rest of his adult life. He’s going to give him an opportunity to make amends and live a meaningful life outside of prison.”When asked how long of a prison sentence the FTX founder would get, O’Brien suggested two decades in prison. “I wouldn’t be surprised if Sam Bankman-Fried got 15 years,” he concluded.Cryptonews will be reporting live from the courtroom of Bankman-Fried’s March 28 sentencing starting at 9:30 a.m ET.

                        Laser Digital – the crypto-focused subsidiary of Japanese asset manager Nomura – has launched an institutionally focused liquid staking fund on Polygon in collaboration with TruFin.The fund, titled the Laser Digital Polygon Adoption Fund, will provide institutional clients with exposure to Polygon’s native gas token, MATIC, while also tapping into native staking rewards.Liquid Staking With Laser Digital
Per a press release shared with Cryptonews, the fund is specifically targeted toward sovereign wealth funds, institutional funds, and private asset managers.“Institutional investors are beginning to understand the benefits and necessity of decentralized security, and this Fund shows that institutions are compelled by the broader ecosystem,” noted Laser Digital.According to stakingrewards.com, the estimated annual staking reward for MATIC stakers is currently 5.94%. However, using the TruStake liquid staking solution, fund investors can access yield consistnetly higher than Lido’s 5% average while maintaining the freedom to sell their tokens at any time.TruFin has already partnered with Balacner and Chainlink to maximize the liquidity of the TruMATIC token.The fund takes advantage of the Polygon AggLayer, which aggregates zero-knowledge proofs from all connected blockchains, boosting liqudiidty and transaction speed while maximizing the fund’s operational efficiency. It will first become available to investors in the United Kingdom following relevant registrations and regulatory approvals.“Laser Digital Asset Management aims to transform DeFi investment opportunities into investable TradFi solutions,” said Sebastien Guglietta, Head of Laser Digital Asset Management.“Leveraging TruFin technology and its integration with Polygon’s AggLayer, we are making Polygon-Matic digital asset investment accessible, in the most secure, and efficient way for institutional investors.”Another Boon For Polygon Adoption
Colin Butler, Global Head of Institutional Capital at Polygon, added that getting institutional investors involved with staking would boost the overall security of the Polygon network.Polygon is one of the leading layer 2 scaling networks for Ethereum (ETH) – the largest smart contract blockchain by volume and market cap.Thanks to Ethereum’s recent Denucun upgrade, the cost of “rollups” on Polygon – batches of transactions that are later settled to the Ethereum blockchain – is expected to drastically fall following the latter’s Feijoa update. It’s also a slight boon for Polygon staking, since Ethereum L1 settlement costs became slightly cheaper.While liquid staking is DeFi’s most popular use case, prominent developers like Vitalik Buterin have warned that the phenomenon is pushing networks like Ethereum toward centralization.

The Protocol: Meme Coins (and Pepe's Best Friend) Swarm Coinbase Layer 2 Chain

It's not something we have historically written a lot about – bridging yields. But a new report from the crypto investment firm Exponential.fi included a chart on these yields, and it caught our eye because they've been rising fast recently, pushing above 15%. Co-founder Mehdi Lebbar attributes the rising yields to higher demand from users, in part a reflection of the trend toward greater interoperability between blockchains, along with the proliferation of layer-2 and layer-3 networks. "As the DeFi ecosystem extends across networks, third-party bridging protocols like Across and Synapse are reaping higher fees," the report reads. These yields are paid out to liquidity providers who supply the bridges with cryptocurrencies, according to Lebbar: "The bridge allows transfers of bitcoins across chains, and people pay commissions on that. Commissions are reversed by the bridge/protocol to liquidity providers." Asked if the higher yields might reflect increased risk, Lebbar said: "The increased yield would reflect 'protocol risk' if we were in a mature, highly efficient market, but that’s not the case for bridging."

Fidelity registers for spot Ethereum ETF - Crypto Briefing




Fidelity Investments (Fidelity) has filed a registration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to apply for a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF). Notably, the filing featured an option to stake a portion of the fund’s assets.According to the S-1 filing, the proposed ETF would be available for trading on the Cboe BZX Exchange, with Fidelity’s digital asset division serving as the custodion of the trust’s Ethereum holdings. However, Fidelity has not specified which staking infrastructure they will be using or partnering with.However, incorporating staking in the ETF structure introduces additional risks, which were outlined in the application. According to Fidelity’s registration statement, current regulatory measures in the US and elsewhere may adversely impact the fund’s status.Causes for termination may come from the SEC itself, if the Commission determines that Fidelity’s fund may be in violation of the 1940 Act. This piece of legislation was enacted in August 22, 1940 and has since codified how Congress regulates investment funds in the US.This act, along with other financial regulations like the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, plays a central role in the country’s financial regulation. Primarily, the 1940 Act seeks to protect investors and the investing public’s interest by requiring investment firms to disclose material information and assessing whether firms under its jurisdiction present or are operating with conflicts of interest.The 1940 Act covers a range of investment entities, including mutual funds, closed-end funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, and holding companies. Notably, under the law, mutual funds are required to limit leverage and maintain sufficient cash reserves to accommodate investors wishing to sell their shares.This law may present contentious and critical points to an Ethereum ETF, even if it has been updated in the past decade. This represents a risk for Fidelity in that it could encompass potential losses for the firm’s proposed Ethereum ETF by slashing penalties and liquidity risks within the staking process.The SEC is currently unclear as to whether Ethereum (Ether/ETH) is a security, with GOP lawmakers demanding the regulator clarify its stance. The status of staking rewards as income is also unclear, and the rewards would be taxable for investors, even in the absence of an associated distribution from the trust. Recently, the Ethereum Foundation was mired in an investigation by an undisclosed “state authority” that was later alleged by Fortune to be an initiative of the SEC as it campaigns to classify Ethereum as a security. The Commission has delayed approval from seven other applicants, with a decision timeline set for May 23 this year.

Dogecoin On-Chain Metrics Explode As Bulls Drive 36% Rally | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin has been heating up recently and this has been apparent in both its price, as well as its on-chain meme metrics. With investor interest now turning back to the OG meme coin, there has been some marked increase in its on-chain metrics, which suggests that the rally might just be starting.
Dogecoin On-Chain Metrics See Significant Increase
Among the Dogecoin on-chain metrics that have seen a significant uptick in recent days, three in particular stand out the most. These include the transaction count, number of whale transactions, and the age consumed of DOGE tokens.

Transaction count and whale transactions saw a notable shift as the price began to recover. As data from the on-chain tracking platform Santiment shows, these active transactions rose significantly from 1.22 billion to 9.2 billion in the space of two days. Looking at the DOGE chart, it shows a correlation during this time between the increase in its price and its transaction count.
Following the same path, the whale transactions, also know as large transactions rallied at this time. These transactions which are carrying DOGE tokens worth $100,000 or more spiked from around 1,500 daily transactions at the start of March to over 4,000 daily transactions toward the end of the month.
The third metric that has seen an increase during this time is the age consumed. The “Age Consumed” here refers to the amount of time that DOGE tokens are being held by investors. So rather than selling their coins, more Dogecoin investors are choosing to hold onto them in anticipation of more upside.

DOGE Bulls Face Resistance
Despite Dogecoin showing considerable strength recently, it continues to face considerable resistance from bears who struggle to pull down the price. The main price point of contention now is $0.2, where the bears have mounted resistance.

Since hitting this level in early March, Dogecoin has been unable to revisit it, making it the level to beat. Nevertheless, the coin is sitting above its 50-day moving average, which means DOGE is skewing toward buy for the short term.
In addition to its on-chain metrics heating up, the Dogecoin daily trading volume witnessed a 13% increase in the last day, suggesting increased interest. If these metrics continue to rise, it could translate to demand for DOGE and this could trigger a rally above $0.2.
At the time of writing, Dogecoin is holding steady above $0.18 and maintaining a 36% gain on the 7-day chart.

Binance Unleashes SHIB, DOGE & PEPE Pairs for Margin Trading - DailyCoin


        
Memecurrency sector observed the hottest week in history this March.



Top crypto platform Binance adds new memecoin Margin trading pairs.



Solana’s emerging canine coins make their way to new all-time highs.
The globe’s leading cryptocurrency exchange has introduced a lengthy list of new trading pairs for Margin. The latest announcement is relevant to both Cross Margin and Isolated Margin in a quest to boost the ecosystem’s liquidity by meeting the rising demand for advanced memecurrency trading.Binance Meets Trading Demand with These PairsFirst, Dogecoin (DOGE) traders can trade DOGE/USDC in both Cross and Isolated margins. Custodians of Shiba Inu (SHIB) can also partake in SHIB/USDC trading in both modes.However, things might look slightly different for crypto aficionados seeking to trade Pepe (PEPE), as this memecoin has now expanded to four trading pairs. In further detail, both Cross and Isolated traders can use PEPE trading against two popular stablecoins: USD Coin (USDC) and First Digital USD (FDUSD).This means that PEPE traders can choose between PEPE/FDUSD and PEPE/USDC pairs on both versions of Margin trading. Meanwhile, fans of brand new, straight-out-the-gate memecoins get BOME/FDUSD, a Solana-based memecurrency.Is the Ongoing Memecurrency Rally Sustainable?The all-around memecoin frenzy in the last couple of months has made the major players adapt to the shifting crypto landscape. Most large and mid-cap memecurrencies have surged in triple digits, as top crypto exchanges have welcomed a series of promising projects, including Book Of Meme (BOME) and Dogwifhat (WIF).As memecurrencies have lately witnessed the most successful week ever in this department, the Spring 2024 memecoin rally is yet to face a longer market correction. For instance, Dogecoin has embarked on a 40% weekly run to claim the yearly heights of $0.188 today. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu’s 289% run placed the original Doge Killer right next to its main rival in the charts.



Younger siblings Dogwifhat and Bonk (BONK) quickly made a name for themselves by securing new all-time highs recently, making these Solana’s canine coins long-term TOP 100 contenders. While the memecoin bull rally is fun to watch, it bears mentioning that memecurrencies are volatile and known for their highly fluctuating market prices.On the Flipside
Book Of Meme (BOME) trading has raised substantial controversy due to allegations of insider trading on BOME’s launch day on Binance.

SBF Supporters Use Autism as Excuse for Lenient Sentencing - DailyCoin


        
SBF’s sentencing trial will take place in a few days.



The former FTX CEO’s loved ones are advocating for lenient judgment as the sentencing nears.



SBF faces multiple decades behind bars.
Following his conviction on multiple counts of fraud in the collapse of FTX, the question of SBF’s fate has lingered across the industry as his sentencing nears. While prosecutors assert that the fallen crypto mogul deserves at least 40 to 50 years behind bars, SBF’s legal team has gone on a ‘lenient-sentence’ advocacy campaign with a string of tactics, seeking to mitigate the sentence he faces.Continuing the trend, more supporters have joined the ‘pro–SBF’ campaign, seeking little to no time behind bars for the convicted CEO.SBF Sentencing Plea: “He Did Not Understand What Was Going On”In various letters on Tuesday, March 26, five individuals called on US Judge Lewis Kaplan to temper SBF’s judgment with mercy, factoring faults in the disgraced crypto mogul’s neurological traits.One stand-out excuse was the assertion that SBF had been diagnosed as on the autistic spectrum, which allegedly played a significant role in the actions that led up to his conviction. Advocate Maria Centrella emphasized that SBF’s autism should be considered as a mitigating factor in his sentencing, adding that the former FTX CEO was likely unaware of the crimes he was committing.“I firmly believe that while he may be an MIT grad - he did not fully understand the scope of what was going on and did not have malicious intent,” stated Centrella.Another Matt Kelly, in a letter with three others, emphasized that the manner of his trial and the psychological troubles stemming from it, as evidenced by the testimony of Caroline Ellison and other SBF co-workers, should be taken into account during his sentencing. They emphasized that determining the most appropriate type of institution for SBF should receive additional consideration. However, the recent pleas are not isolated; they represent the latest legal efforts to secure minimal time behind bars for SBF.SBF Sentencing CampaignOver the past month, SBF’s lawyers have raised pleas for leniency ahead of his sentencing trial, marked by limitless arguments citing his mental health conditions.



On February 28, SBF’s defense counsel submitted a sentencing memorandum to the United States District Court Of the Southern District of New York, touting SBF’s image in the lobby for a sentence no longer than 63-78 months, approximately five to six and a half years. “Those who know Sam know he is selfless, altruistic, and a young man who has demonstrated throughout his life “a genuine concern for those less fortunate around the world,” the memorandum stated, adding that, “as a society, we need more people like him,” the lawyers stated.Bankman-Fried’s family and friends have submitted an additional 27 letters expressing concern for his well-being and asserting that his personal traits make him unsuitable for prison. On The Flipside
Despite the arguments that SBF’s autistic spectrum factored into his crimes, the condition is renowned for its positive effects and is not indicative of incapability or irresponsibility.



SBF’s team has argued that the 2022 FTX collapse was due to bad business decisions and not maliciously driven.



Nearly two years after its collapse, an extensive list of creditors awaits compensation for the $8 billion loss incurred.
Why This MattersThe arguments of neurological disorders as excuses for fraud ahead of SBF’s sentencing underscore the relentless efforts by his team to mitigate the consequences of his actions. However, it is a dangerous and outdated viewpoint that is unlikely to hold up as an excuse for his litany of crimes in the eyes of a judge.

Ethena Labs Announces Airdrop Date of Native Token ENA - The Defiant

Starting April 2, 750 million ENA or 5% of the total supply, will get airdropped.Synthetic stablecoin startup Ethena Labs has announced it is one step closer to the holy grail of internet money.After six weeks of Ethena’s “Shard Campaign,” or points system, which saw the total supply of its stablecoin, USDe, balloon to $1.3 billion, the ecosystem is ready to begin distributing its second native token, tickered ENA.Launching the ENA token, according to the team, marks the beginning of the decentralization of the Ethena protocol.Beginning April 2, ENA will be eligible for claim on the project’s official claim website, as centralized exchanges get ready for listing. On this date, the project will distribute 750 million ENA, or 5% of the total 15 billion supply.The 5% allocated to the airdrop will come from the overall 30% that belongs to Ecosystem Development.ENA Distribution ENA will play a pivotal role in governance, according to the team. Voting using the token will go to deciding general risk management frameworks, USDe backing composition, exchange and custodian exposure, community grants, and size of Reserve Fund, among other uses.Calling it the holy grail of internet money is a lofty claim.According to Guy Young, Ethena Labs’ founder, the holy grail of crypto is building or attaining the status of money.“BTC and ETH converge to trying to become money,” he told The Defiant, and that Ethena’s mission–and holy grail–is creating their own native version of internet money.For eligibility, users that stake, hold USDe in incentivized pools, LP pools, or Pendle Finance, must leave their tokens in their respective wallets and protocols.Additionally, holders of two NFT collections–SchizoPosters and Redacted Remilio Babies–will receive 3% of the initial airdrop amount.Ethena’s Controversial Stablecoin USDeEthena Labs’ caused a stir in the crypto industry on February 19 after it announced a 27% yield on its native stablecoin, USDe.Double digit yield-bearing assets reminded Crypto Twitter of Terra’s UST algorithmic stablecoin, which saw its demise in early May 2022, causing a death spiral that wiped out $50 billion in market capitalization in three days.But the synthetic stablecoin has been lauded by many for its architecture, which backs the token that is pegged to $1 with staked Ethereum, while also hedging stETH with short ETH positions on centralized exchanges. Both stETH and short positions contribute to yield that’s passed on to stablecoin holders.Austin Campbell, founder and managing partner of Zero Knowledge Consulting firm, said Ethena is a “truly interesting experiment” and is substituting credit risk with price risk.His view echoed that of Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital, who said USDe should be conceptualized as a structured product, and that it offers a “key source” of liquidity.
