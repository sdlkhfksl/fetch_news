Vitalik Buterin Donates 30 Ethereum (ETH) to Tornado Cash Developers’ Legal Fund: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin just gave a substantial amount to support the legal battle of Tornado Cash developers Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm.
Data from Ethereum blockchain explorer Etherscan shows that Buterin transferred 30 ETH worth $113,678 to the “Free Alexey & Roman” legal fund on May 30th.










Tornado Cash is an Ethereum-based coin mixing service that facilitates anonymous crypto transactions. In 2022, the US imposed a sanction on the platform claiming that it is used to launder illicit funds and pose a threat to national security. 
The developers of Tornado Cash were subsequently charged. Earlier this month, a district court in the Netherlands sentenced Pertsev to 64 months in jail for laundering billions of dollars worth of crypto.
US authorities also arrested Storm last year. The Justice Department charged him and fellow developer Roman Semenov for allegedly helping the North Korean hacking group Lazarus launder their criminal proceeds.
In January, Storm asked for donations to help fund his legal defense, and in a video posted on the social media platform X, he said that the outcome of his trial would have significant implications on the future of digital assets.
The legal fund on the decentralized fundraising platform Juicebox has so far raised 597.07 ETH worth $2.25 million. The initiative says Roman and Alexey’s legal expenses range between $90,000 and $100,000 per month.
“Roman and Alex need your help to build a strong defense not just for their sake, but for crypto users and developers worldwide. In response to the arrests, a group of sympathizers came together to form WeWantJusticeDAO to advocate on their behalf and help raise funds for legal defense. However, time and money are running out, and we need your support.”

Doge Loves Trump (DOTRUMP) to Surge 11,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Doge Loves Trump (DOTRUMP) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Doge Loves Trump (DOTRUMP), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Loves Trump presents a similar opportunity.



Doge Loves Trump has a market cap below $10,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Doge Loves Trump could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Doge Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Doge Loves Trump on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Loves Trump by entering its contract address – AQSeJZGNc2UD9okyyy6uWmUGdxKK1DYrr7eEQ9mstQbc – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOTRUMP.

Ripple Strengthens Commitment to Blockchain Amid Regulatory Challenges, Eyes Future Crypto ETFs



                    

Ripple remains steadfast in its commitment to blockchain technology despite regulatory hurdles, exemplified by its $25 million investment in Fairshake. 



This move aligns perfectly with their goal of driving global crypto adoption.




In a recent interview at Consensus 2024, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted the urgent need for improved U.S. policies and regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. 



Garlinghouse stressed the importance of clarity in regulation, criticizing the SEC’s inconsistent approach to the crypto industry:



“For the U.S. to remain competitive, it is crucial to establish clear and consistent crypto regulations. The SEC’s contradictory lawsuits create confusion.”



He argued that updated policies are essential to keep up with the rapidly evolving financial landscape, especially in the realm of cryptocurrencies.



The discussion at the conference also touched on the potential for cryptocurrencies like XRP, Solana [SOL], and Cardano [ADA] to be included in ETFs. 



Garlinghouse expressed confidence in the inevitability of such financial products:



“The introduction of ETFs for XRP, Solana, and Cardano is just a matter of time. Such advancements are favorable for the market.”




This viewpoint is supported by other industry experts. Brian Kelly from CNBC’s ‘Fast Money’ speculated that a Solana spot ETF might soon be approved in the U.S. 



Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, also noted the significance of Ethereum ETFs’ approval, signaling wider acceptance of cryptocurrency investments.

Garlinghouse also commented on the increasing role of cryptocurrencies in political discussions, especially as elections approach. 



He criticized the SEC’s approach under Gary Gensler, which he believes complicates participation for both institutional and retail investors:



“It’s not surprising to see crypto becoming a focal point in presidential debates. The lack of clear regulations hinders market growth.”



He concluded by calling for the U.S. to formulate sensible and transparent regulations to match the pace of global economic leaders in the cryptocurrency space.



In summary, Ripple’s proactive approach towards regulatory clarity and substantial investments in blockchain technology highlight its ongoing commitment to the crypto industry. 



The ongoing discussions about crypto-ETFs and regulatory frameworks underscore the intersection of U.S. politics and cryptocurrencies, emphasizing the need for modernized regulations to foster innovation and market expansion. 



Clearer and more comprehensive guidelines will be crucial for the continued development of the digital asset market.

Short-selling opportunity as this crypto registers high funding rates


    The meme coin mania is back in the cryptocurrency market, and cryptocurrencies like PEPE show signals of being overvalued. This could foreshadow a short-selling opportunity, as suggested by increased open interest (OI) and high funding rates.



Previously, the meme coin boom marked a local top, followed by a market crash that rewarded these crypto short-sellers. Should a similar pattern play out, this asset class is at the peril of suffering another hit despite positive social activity from influencers.



As of this writing, PEPE has $644.85 million in open interest, ranking fifth on CoinGlass. This value represents 10% of the meme coin’s $5.98 billion market cap, trading at $0.0000142. Despite a drop of 20.34% in the $1.55 billion 24-hour volume, the market’s open interest has fallen by 6.37% on the meme coin.







PEPE open interest and derivatives volume. Source: CoinGlass



PEPE funding rates and a short-selling opportunity



In particular, the consolidated exchanges’ funding rates for PEPE indicate an open interest weighted to long positions. Currently, long-position traders pay an APR of 42.57% to short-sellers to remedy derivatives imbalances.



Therefore, this high funding rate creates an opportunity to open shorts against PEPE and profit from the current imbalance. Short-selling PEPE now represents a bet against the market and presents risks, as the landscape could quickly change.



Funding Rate Heatmap: PEPE. Source: CoinGlass



On that note, cryptocurrency traders have already started positioning within this short-selling opportunity, which is visible on the liquidations heatmap. As these traders place their bets, accumulated liquidity upwards could trigger a short squeeze, punishing these bearish speculators.



Recently, PEPE’s price action has already liquidated long positions through a long squeeze to the current levels.

Still, the meme coin could move either way according to the capital volume that enters for short or long positions in the following days. Cryptocurrency traders and speculators must understand the volatile nature of these digital assets and act cautiously moving forward.

Tether Co-Founder Announces His Potential Return To Hong Kong Coin Edition


							

Brock Pierce has recently shared insights on his potential return to Hong Kong with his new business.
Though Pierce stated that he had conversations with Hong Kong’s authorities, he did not disclose the venture’s details.
The Tether co-founder remains optimistic about mainland China’s potential acceptance of cryptocurrencies.




Brock Pierce, an American entrepreneur and co-founder of Tether, recently shared insights on his possible return to Hong Kong amidst the government’s efforts to establish the crypto hub. During the Solowin and Sequire Asia Investor Summit in Hong Kong on Wednesday, Pierce hinted at his new enterprise in Hong Kong, though the details of his business remained undisclosed.









According to a recent report by the South China Morning Post, Pierce has been in a “continued conversation” with the authorities to bring his new venture into the city. The entrepreneur cited,




Big things may come from this. I’m going to go where I think my time is most valuable. I’m enthusiastic about what’s happening in Hong Kong, which means I’m enthusiastic about working here, which means the likelihood of something happening is good right now.










Further, Pierce expressed his optimistic approach to the potential establishment of crypto markets in mainland China, where cryptocurrencies are currently banned. He believes that Hong Kong, with its enthusiasm for crypto expansion and efforts for a full-fledged crypto hub, would act as a gateway to the mainland. He added it’s just a matter of time, stating,




Is China going to open up [to crypto]? … I’d say it’s inevitable. The question is not so much if, it’s a matter of when.




In a recent development in the Hong Kong crypto market, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced the list of exchanges, including Crypto.com and Bullish, which are poised to receive a license in the region. However, platforms such as ByBit and OKX have withdrawn their license applications. Hong Kong’s move is part of the government’s initiative to bring regulatory clarity to Hong Kong’s crypto markets.

Bitcoin Runes Resurgence? Why Asia’s Institutional Investors Could Fuel Growth - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIn crypto, where most histories are reduced to one-liners, the tale of the Runes protocol—an optimized framework for creating meme coins on Bitcoin—goes something like this: It started with a bang and faded out, just as fast, with a whimper. Barely a month has passed since Runes’ blockbuster debut alongside the Bitcoin halving in April; and yet, the protocol’s subsequent failure to meet lofty benchmarks has led many to write the whole endeavor off as a misfire. But could growing institutional excitement for Runes in East Asia signal a possible second act for the budding protocol?While mainstream chatter around Runes has quieted in the West, buzz in Asia surrounding the protocol has only continued to snowball—particularly among institutional investors and more centralized building teams who see it as a more sophisticated riff on the theme compared to the earlier BRC-20 fungible token standard.BRC-20 tokens, the first wave of Bitcoin meme coins, created heaps of organic excitement when they took crypto by storm in 2023, birthed from a makeshift tweak to Bitcoin Ordinals code. Their debut was chaotic, highly experimental, and decentralized—the perfect storm for success in the cryptosphere. The Runes protocol, by contrast, was rolled out far more methodically, by a team of reputable engineers who focused on security, scalability, and easily navigable building tools. In fact, it came from the original creator of the Ordinals protocol, Casey Rodarmor, who believed he could make a better fungible token protocol than the one that riffed on his own earlier code.That emphasis arguably hasn’t yet made much of an impression on degen traders. But investors in East Asia say it’s already made a world of difference to them. “Runes is structured to potentially meet the stringent requirements of institutional investors, emphasizing scalability, efficiency, and security,” Ciara Sun, founder and managing partner of Asia-focused crypto investment firm C Squared Ventures, told Decrypt. “This alignment might make Runes more appealing to a broader institutional base.”Some Asian investment firms, like the Hong Kong-based Newman Group, have already jumped headfirst into Runes. The company says it's actively pushing Runes development via portfolio  companies like Xverse and Liquidium, given what the firm sees as Runes’ potential to become a fundamental infrastructure layer for the entire crypto industry. “We believe Runes could end up being bigger than BRC-20, especially considering institutional interest,” Adrian Lai, Newman Group’s founder, told Decrypt. “Runes' technical advantages and potential for efficient cross-chain transactions could make it a preferred choice for institutions looking to access DeFi on Bitcoin.”Some of crypto’s most prominent companies have already lined up behind the protocol. Leading cross-chain NFT marketplace Magic Eden launched a dedicated Runes platform in April. OKX, one of Asia’s top centralized crypto exchanges, has eagerly embraced the protocol; it was the first such exchange to offer zero-fee Runes trading.Paige Xu, an investor at OKX, says Runes were almost perfectly designed to check every box on an institutional investor’s wishlist. She particularly noted the protocol’s unspent transaction output (UTXO) model, which allows tokens to interact far more seamlessly with crypto wallets, layer-2 networks, and DeFi apps than BRC-20 tokens or Ordinals inscriptions currently can. “Runes has the right stuff—efficiency and a slim blockchain footprint—that institutions typically look for in tech, that can handle heavy demand securely,” Xu told Decrypt, adding that her personal views do not necessarily reflect that of her employer. The investor noted, however, that Runes’ ascendancy to dominance via institutional support is far from a done deal. “Adoption of Bitcoin-based tech like this is still pretty new, and a lot depends on how well we can educate and integrate these assets into the broader financial world,” she said. In the days following its April 19 launch, interest in Runes soared; three days in, the protocol saw over a million transactions, according to on-chain data from Dune. Transaction volume then plummeted by as much as 90% in the following weeks, amid a broader cooling-off period across the crypto ecosystem.In late May, however, activity on Runes more than tripled. For the first time ever, the total market capitalization of assets on the protocol hit $1 billion, according to GeniiData. That figure has since eclipsed $2 billion, indicating that Runes may be enjoying something of a comeback (despite being barely a month old). There is no guarantee that institutional excitement about Runes will lead the protocol to dominate the crypto industry, as many once assumed. But if current sentiment in East Asia is any indication, then crypto’s largest players are coming to the conclusion that there is only one road to mainstreaming fungible Bitcoin tokens—and that road runs through Runes. “If issuing fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain is the right move, then deciding between Runes and BRC-20 comes down to which has a better chance of long-term viability and diversity,” MiXWeb3, the pseudonymous founder of the Runes China community, told Decrypt. “That makes the choice much clearer.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Trader That Called May 2021 Crypto Collapse Unveils Potential Max Target for Bitcoin Bull Market Top - The Daily Hodl


								A veteran trader with a history of several accurate macro crypto calls is revealing what he thinks could be the maximum upside price target for Bitcoin (BTC) this market cycle.
Pseudonymous trader Dave the Wave shares with his 146,000 followers on the social media platform X a chart using his version of the logarithmic growth channel (LGC) curve, which aims to predict Bitcoin’s longer-term cycle lows and highs while filtering out shorter-term volatility.










According to the trader, his LGC model is suggesting that Bitcoin’s current market cycle could peak out somewhere around a maximum of 3x above current prices, or roughly the $205,000 level.
“BTC price has always been relatively close to previous highs at the time of halvings.
Of interest, this time round, is the 4x off the bottom as compared to the previous 3xs. This suggests some front-running of price relative to the halving.
The LGC model suggests a max of 3x from here. Also why you might want to consider trading the extra volatility of alt/ USD in order to take some profits while continuing to sit on BTC for the longer term.”
Source: Dave the Wave/X
In the shorter term, Dave the Wave says that Bitcoin is currently approaching an ascending diagonal level that has in the past acted as a strong support for BTC.
“BTC price closing in yet again on what has acted as strong support…”

At time of writing, BTC is trading at $67,702.

America’s Wealthiest Prisoner: Former Binance CEO CZ Starts Four-Month Jail Sentence ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Ex-Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has surrendered to a California-based federal facility where he will serve his sentence for financial crimes that led the cryptocurrency exchange he founded to agree to pay a mammoth $4.3 billion fine. 



Zhao pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws in November. With a $37 billion fortune, he has made history as the richest US inmate ever.



CZ’s Prison Sentence In California Prison Kicks Off



Changpeng Zhao has officially started his four-month prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc in Lompoc, California. It’s a low-security prison located northwest of Los Angeles.



The 47-year-old billionaire had pleaded guilty to federal money laundering charges last year, which focused on a corporate culture at Binance that U.S. prosecutors claimed dismissed fraud prevention in favor of the company’s growth. He was forced to step down from the world’s largest exchange he founded and cough up a $50 million personal fine.



The U.S. Department of Justice had recommended Zhao be sentenced to three years in prison for the egregious violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. But the crypto kingpin was given a tremendously light sentence of four months.

&nbsp



Since flying to Seattle to enter the guilty plea, CZ had been barred from leaving the United States as travel restrictions were imposed on him by Judge Richard Jones. Prosecutors warned that the former Binance chief, with an estimated wealth of $37.2 billion, was a flight risk.



It’s unclear how long Zhao will serve at the prison camp in California. Still, he will potentially receive credit for time already served, and the four-month sentence could include as little as 10 months in jail with the remaining time under supervised release.



Post-Jail Plans



Zhao’s prison time will likely be more of a blip in his story than the end of his line. After doing his time, CZ plans to focus on global online education for children — most likely through the Giggle Academy, which he revealed in March while awaiting his sentencing.



CZ also plans to maintain his existing crypto holdings and remain a passive investor, suggesting his continued confidence and commitment to the crypto industry. Earlier last month, he observed that Binance had been “under the microscope” yet customer funds remained SAFU, underscoring the importance of compliance with regulations.



Following Zhao’s resignation, Binance outlined an optimistic vision for the future. “We are confident that Binance will emerge as a stronger company as we lay the foundation for the next 50 years,” the exchange asserted.

$1 XRP Price Nigh as Ripple's Move To Become Stablecoin Giant Proves Weighty with Whales Moving Millions ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
The XRP community is on edge as significant cryptocurrency movements to exchanges surge, raising concerns among investors alike about a possible dump.



Since Tuesday, Whale Alert, a crypto analytics firm focused on highlighting huge crypto transactions, has been reporting a series of substantial transfers involving XRP, totaling over $50 million, to various exchanges.



Notably, on May 29, the firm highlighted a transfer of 28,050,000 XRP, valued at $14.6 million from an unknown wallet to Bitstamp, before detecting another transfer of 23,130,000 XRP, worth roughly $12 million, to Mexico-based crypto exchange Bitso.



These transactions follow a pattern observed earlier on Tuesday, May 28, with a transfer of 19,880,000 XRP, equivalent to approximately $10.4 million to Bitso. Subsequently, another transfer of 29,280,000 XRP, valued at $15.4 million, was sent to Bitstamp.



This consistent influx of XRP into exchanges without corresponding withdrawals has rattled the XRP community, fueling speculations of an impending market downturn. This comes when XRP grapples with establishing a firm footing amid a prolonged consolidation phase, with suppressed volatility hindering clear patterns or direction for the cryptocurrency to follow.

&nbsp



Meanwhile, investors are eagerly banking on factors such as legal clarity for the crypto sector, more so after the conclusion of the Ripple lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, anticipation mounts as investors hope for a spot XRP ETF approval and the imminent launch of Ripple’s stablecoin.



That said, amidst these developments, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed confidence in crypto’s impact on the upcoming US elections, with Ripple recently donating $25 million to pro-crypto committee Fairshake. In a statement following the donation, Garlinghouse noted they aimed to counter negative sentiments surrounding crypto, particularly from “backward-looking politicians” like Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler, by supporting crypto-friendly legislation and candidates.



Echoing Garlinghouse’s optimism, lobbying groups such as the Blockchain Association and the Crypto Council for Innovation have advocated for favorable regulatory frameworks, culminating in recent successes like the passage of the FIT21 crypto bill by the US House of Representatives.



That said, as the XRP community grapples with the implications of significant whale activity and regulatory developments, the path to a $1 XRP price remains uncertain. Yet, amidst the turbulence, stakeholders remain committed to steering XRP towards stability and growth, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s resilience amidst evolving market dynamics.



At press time, XRP was trading at $0.5179, reflecting a 1.47% price drop over the past 24 hours.

Massive Shiba Inu Burn Ignites Hope For Price Recovery Despite Market Downturn - Benzinga

Dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu SHIB/USD has seen a significantly increase in token burns, with a 207% surge in the last several hours. What Happened: The Shiba Inu community has burned 4,796,486 SHIB tokens in several hours. This represents a 207.81% increase in the burn rate.This spike in token burns comes amid low trading activity for Bitcoin BTC/USD and other major cryptocurrencies, including SHIB.The market is eagerly anticipating a significant price shift. Shiba Inu's price has declined 2.18% to $0.00002473.This coincides with a broader market downturn affecting most cryptocurrencies.The market's response to the current profit-taking phase will be crucial in determining SHIB's short-term price direction.Also Read: Crypto Trader Says These Two Meme Coins Are Set To Spike — And Neither Of Them Are Dogecoin Or Shiba InuIf buyers absorb selling pressure, the price may stabilize or rise. However, a sustained sell-off could test SHIB's support levels.Maintaining a price above the daily SMA 50 at $0.00002454 could be critical for Shiba Inu to sustain its upward momentum and prevent further losses.Why It Matters: The recent surge in Shiba Inu's burn rate is part of a broader trend observed over the past few weeks. Earlier in March, there was a 103.45% increase in SHIB tokens burned, with 34,681,610 SHIB tokens sent to inaccessible wallets.This consistent burning of tokens is seen as a strategy to reduce the circulating supply, potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens. The Shiba Inu community remains hopeful that these efforts will lead to a price recovery despite the current market downturn.Now Read: Crypto Analyst Predicts Pepe Coin 'To Be Breaking Out' As Price Escapes Bearish ChannelThis content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo: Shutterstock

Scaramucci Warns Biden's Veto Of Crypto Custody Bill Will 'Cost Him More Than He Realizes': 'Out Of Step With The Future' - Benzinga

Former White House Director of Communications Anthony Scaramucci did not take kindly to President Joe Biden’s vetoing of the crypto custody bill. On Saturday, the financier and founder of investment firm SkyBridge Capital warned about the potential ramifications of the president’s decision.What Happened: Biden’s position on crypto “may cost him more than he realizes,” said Scaramucci in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “It was a really bad decision to veto that bill. Especially at this critical time.”Warren Slammed: Scaramucci also took shots at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), alleging that she had a role in the latest development. “Warren 70+ Biden 81 think this isn't a big deal put younger democrats know they are out of step with the future. Could be very costly,” he said in a separate post.The ex-White House aide went a step further and called her the “worst senator in America,” adding that she should retire. He also called for support for Republican Massachusetts Senate candidate John Deaton, a former Marine and cryptocurrency attorney.See Also: How To Buy Bitcoin BTC/USDWhy It’s Important: H.J.Res. 109, which Biden vetoed, is a congressional resolution that would have overturned the SEC’s current approach to banks and crypto. The SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 currently requires banks to classify customers’ crypto assets as liabilities and significantly increases the banks’ cost of handling cryptocurrencies. This has led to opposition from banking groups.  Regulators, however, are in favor of erring on the side of caution, given the risks associated with holding cryptos in the wake of collapse of crypto companies such as FTX and several other scandals involving cryptos.Before it was tabled  before Biden, the e H.J.Res. 109 was passed by Congress, with mostly Republican support.While rejecting the proposal, Biden said, “By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, this Republican-led resolution would inappropriately constrain the SEC's ability to set forth appropriate guardrails and address future issues.”“This reversal of the considered judgment of SEC staff in this way risks undercutting the SEC's broader authorities regarding accounting practices.”On the contrary, the president expressed his willingness to work with the Congress on a “comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system.”Scaramucci is a crypto bull and predicted Bitcoin BTC/USD would hit $200,000 after the halving that occurred in April.At last check, Bitcoin traded up 0.54% at $68,088.37, according to Benzinga Pro data.Read Next: ‘Took Guts To Own Bitcoin:’ SkyBridge’s Anthony Scaramucci Says It Would Need ‘Brains’ To Reap BTC RallyPhoto: Shutterstock

Bitcoin Bull Nayib Bukele is President of El Salvador Again: Here's How Much BTC His Country Owns - Bitcoin Sistemi

El Salvador President Nayib Bukele was sworn in for a second term on Saturday, vowing to address the country's economic problems with the same determination that marked his campaign against gang violence in his first term.
Bukele, who was re-elected in February with more than 80% of the vote after a controversial court decision, has declared his intention to cure the country's economic “illnesses”.


Speaking from the balcony of the National Palace in San Salvador, Bukele, 42, reassured the public that the gang-related violence plaguing the country was largely under control. “Salvadorian society is still sick, but it is no longer cancerous,” he said, referring to the criminal gangs that once made El Salvador one of the most dangerous countries in the world.
With security largely restored, Bukele now faces the difficult task of reviving the stagnant economy. “Now that we have ensured the most pressing issue, which is security, we will focus on important problems, starting with the economy,” he said.






Despite Bukele's popularity for improving security in the country of 6.3 million, his economic policies have faced obstacles. The ambitious Bitcoin City project, designed as a tax-free, cryptocurrency-supported center, has had difficulty attracting investment. Additionally, El Salvador's public debt has risen to over $30 billion, nearly 84% of its gross domestic product.
There are currently 5,769 Bitcoins worth approximately $389 million in the country's treasury. Bukele reported that his country purchased 1 BTC every day.

Brad Garlinghouse on $DOGE: “I Don’t Know What the Use Case Is” | Cryptoglobe


                                
At the recent Consensus 2024 conference (held May 29, 31, 2024, in Austin, Texas), Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made headlines by directly criticizing Dogecoin, questioning its value and use case. 



Dogecoin (DOGE) began as a parody cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in December 2013. Initially intended as a joke, it features the Shiba Inu dog from the “Doge” meme as its mascot. Despite its humorous origins, Dogecoin quickly garnered a substantial following due to its active and engaging community on platforms like Reddit.



The appeal of Dogecoin lies in its friendly and fun nature. It was designed to be more accessible and lighthearted compared to Bitcoin. Dogecoin transactions are faster and cheaper, typically costing just a fraction of a penny, which makes it practical for everyday use and microtransactions. The unlimited supply of DOGE contrasts sharply with Bitcoin’s capped supply, aiming to promote spending over hoarding.



A significant factor in Dogecoin’s sustained popularity is its high-profile endorsements and social media influence. Celebrities like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons have frequently tweeted about Dogecoin, driving spikes in its price and keeping it in the public eye. This celebrity backing, coupled with its meme-driven culture, has kept Dogecoin relevant and highly popular.



In 2021, Dogecoin experienced a meteoric rise, driven by social media buzz and celebrity endorsements. This period saw its price surge from fractions of a cent to over $0.70, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Although its price has since stabilized and dropped from its all-time high, Dogecoin remains a favorite for short-term trading due to its high liquidity and volatility.



Despite criticisms regarding its lack of intrinsic value and infinite supply, Dogecoin’s strong community, low transaction costs, and ongoing celebrity endorsements ensure it remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency market. Its potential future integrations, such as with the X platform for payments, hint at continued growth and utility.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Garlinghouse highlighted the irony of the United States, the largest economy in the world, ranking low in terms of regulatory clarity. He stressed that clear regulations could unlock the potential of the U.S. economy, attracting significant institutional investment. This, in turn, could create substantial opportunities for growth and innovation in the crypto space.



Despite the popularity of speculative assets like Dogecoin, Garlinghouse underscored the importance of focusing on projects that provide real-world utility. He pointed out that while Dogecoin has garnered significant attention, its lack of a clear use case raises questions about its long-term value. Instead, he called for the industry to concentrate on developing blockchain projects that address tangible problems and offer practical solutions.



Garlinghouse noted that there are many blockchain projects currently demonstrating significant utility across various sectors. He believes that the future of the industry should be built on these practical applications rather than speculative investments. According to him, the next decade for cryptocurrency must prioritize solving real-world problems to achieve sustainable growth and widespread adoption.



Garlinghouse said:



“You know, I get a ton of s**t when I say these things, but I’m going to say it anyway. I don’t think Dogecoin has been a good thing for the industry, and I’m not anti-Dogecoin, but it’s like, I don’t know what the use case is. I don’t know, like, are there projects being built to solve real utility? And I see lots of real utility across lots of different chains, and I think that is what is critical, and for me, the 10-year prediction has to be about … solving real problems.“

Ripple's XRP Sees $1.5 Billion Transferred in 24 Hours


Ripple’s XRP token has experienced substantial activity over the past 24 hours, drawing attention from the crypto community.
Blockchain tracker Whale Alert reported the transfer of 3 billion XRP tokens, valued at approximately $1.5 billion, in several transactions. This large-scale movement has sparked concerns about potential price impact.
Ripple Escrow Activities Triggers Market Concerns 

Typically, Ripple releases around 1 billion XRP tokens from its escrow wallet at the beginning of each month. However, this month’s unusual asset movements have surprised the community, leading to various speculations about these transactions.
Crypto commentator Marty Party noted that the 3 billion tokens represented 5.45% of XRP’s total circulating supply and were transferred between Ripple-affiliated wallets within 30 minutes. Some community members clarified that these asset movements were standard fund consolidations related to escrow activities. They highlighted that of the 3 billion tokens, 1 billion worth $520 million was unlocked from Ripple’s escrow address.

“Majority of these are internal movements and escrow relock ups. Everyone it says ‘unknown’ account the bot was wrong and it was still a Ripple account,” crypto analyst Michael Nardolillo explained.

Historically, XRP’s price tends to fluctuate in response to Ripple’s escrow releases, often influenced by the prevailing market sentiment. Despite a 1% decline in the last 24 hours, XRP’s price remains stable at $0.51, indicating that the recent escrow release has not significantly impacted its performance.

However, some market experts believe the token release could introduce additional selling pressure, hindering XRP’s potential recovery. Reports suggest Ripple may be preparing for its largest monthly XRP dump since 2017, reserving 400 million XRP tokens worth $208 million for a sell-off in June.

These actions would have a telling impact on XRP’s price. While XRP remains among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, it has been one of the worst-performing major tokens this year. According to Tradingview data, XRP’s value has dropped 18% year-to-date, with only Cardano’s ADA performing worse, showing a 27% decline.

Notcoin Records 335% Weekly Gains, Closing in on Top 50


Popular play-to-earn token Notcoin (NOT) continues to attract investors with its impressive price performance. 
With the overall crypto market staying steady, NOT’s massive surge has caught the eye of traders, showing strong buying interest.
Notcoin Surpasses $2 Billion Market Cap

The NOT token officially launched on May 16. After the release, it dropped by over 60%, falling from $0.012 to as low as $0.0050.
However, in the last week, the token has made a stunning recovery, rising by over 335% to reach an all-time high of $0.028. NOT’s market cap has grown to about $2.3 billion, pushing it close to the top 50 cryptocurrencies. The 24-hour trading volume surged to $4.3 billion, a 265% increase from the previous day.
The crypto community is actively discussing Notcoin’s dynamics. Prominent trader Crypto Steam suggested that the main triggers of the current rally were the launch of the staking function, token burning, and market maker actions.

“Around 18m $NOT have been burned and taken out of circulation forever (reduced sell-pressure). While this doesn’t seem a lot investors might price in additional burns in the future, it is crypto after all and valuations don’t have to be reasonable”, Crypto Stream noted.

Ripple Escalates Pro-Crypto Advocacy with $25M Fairshake Fund


																Ripple has contributed $25 million to the Fairshake super PAC, aligning with an industry-wide effort to advocate for pro-crypto policies and politicians.
Ripple’s decision to boost Fairshake’s efforts comes amid its own ongoing legal battle with regulatory bodies like the SEC. The agency’s lawsuit prompted the company to take a more proactive stance in advocating for fair and balanced regulation within the industry.
Ripple Advancing Pro-Crypto Agenda
In a press release, Ripple stated that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s strategy of attempting to regulate the cryptocurrency industry through enforcement has proven ineffective.
While Congress is presently progressing with comprehensive legislation for the sector to ensure a bright future for American innovation, competitiveness, and expansion, the United States lags behind other nations that have embraced the asset class and its underlying technology.
Ripple highlighted the critical importance of the 2024 elections for the industry, emphasizing the choice between candidates supporting or hindering technological innovation. It also highlighted the need for leaders who understand and promote policies fostering innovation, consumer protection, and market fairness.




While speaking about the contributing Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said,
“Our contributions to Fairshake are just one of the many ways Ripple will actively invest in educating voters on the role crypto will play in the future and the dangers of the anti-crypto stance some policymakers are clinging to in Washington.”
The exec also added that the company as well as the rest of the industry should refuse to remain silent in the face of unelected regulators’ attempts to stifle progress and economic advancement, which millions of Americans benefit from.
The development comes almost six months after Ripple gave $20 million to Fairshake, which has already used $11.3 million for federal elections. This increase in contributions marks a significant rise in the company’s political activity. According to FEC records, the San Francisco-based company had only donated $500,000 during the 2022 election cycle.
Ripple’s contributions make up nearly half of the $100 million-plus raised by Fairshake from major figures in the cryptocurrency sector, including industry giants like Coinbase and Gemini exchanges, venture capital leader Andreessen Horowitz, and asset management powerhouse ARK Invest.
Ripple-SEC: Legal Showdown
Ripple has been engaged in a prolonged legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for several years, following accusations by the regulatory watchdog that the company unlawfully raised $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP, which it deemed an unregistered security.
The SEC recently filed a remedies brief contesting Ripple’s stance on penalties in their ongoing legal dispute. It essentially seeks fines against Ripple despite Judge Torres’ ruling that XRP is not a security in programmatic sales. The blockchain company, on the other hand, argued that fines should not surpass $10 million, citing a lack of fraudulent intent. Both parties await a final ruling.

Shiba Inu Loses Vital Support: Critical State of SHIB, Ethereum (ETH) to Hit $4,000? Solana (SOL) Might Show Massive Reversal Soon

Shiba Inu is on the verge of losing some important ground for the price, and it may lead to some serious issues for the token. However, there are some support levels below the aforementioned support. Luckily, the volume is descending, which, in case of a dropping price, is a good sign for the asset.There is a worrying trend in the SHIB technical indicators. The price has been attempting to maintain a higher level above $0.00002476 while testing the lower bounds of its current trading range.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThis scenario implies the possibility of a further decline in SHIB should it be unable to hold its position above these support levels. Another bearish signal on the chart is the descending triangle pattern, which usually indicates that the downward trend will continue.Regarding volume, this bearish scenario of decreasing trading volume is encouraging. The price may short-term stabilize, if lower volume on a downward trend typically signifies waning selling pressure. But SHIB will require a large boost in buying interest — which is not there at the moment — for a meaningful recovery.Bearish signals are also visible in the relative strength index, which is hovering near the oversold area at 44. This suggests that there may be room for a price bounce, but the next move will largely depend on how the market feels overall. Investors need to monitor the $0.00002310 support level closely.Ethereum stays putEthereum could be on the verge of hitting $4,000 as the price remains stable and does not drop below the bottom of the trading channel at around $3,700. Luckily, that fact brings us closer to the potential return above the $4,000 threshold and the upcoming surge of inflows to Ethereum. But, of course, always keep in mind the broader market perspective.A break through this barrier could lead to a more significant decline that could take the price down to the next major support level, which is $0.00001940 (200 EMA). Based on the chart, Ethereum appears to be stabilizing, which is encouraging.The price has been holding its position above the crucial $3,700 support level. The medium- to long-term trend can be clearly seen using the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages. At the moment, the 50-day moving average is serving as a support level. It is common for a consolidation pattern to form near the upper end of a trading range to precede a breakout in the recent price action.Solana's reversal planSolana could be closer to a reversal than you may think. The price of the asset has secured a placement at around 26 EMA, which acts as a trendline support for now. Hopefully, the price of SOL will be able to regain some momentum and finally show us the possibility of a reversal.The price action in Solana is creating what appears to be a bullish setup on the chart. Around $163, the 26-day moving average (EMA) is a strong support level that the price is presently trading above. This support has remained stable, halting additional drops and indicating that buyers are intervening at this point.As the price rises further, the 50-day moving average is beginning to turn upward, which may indicate the start of a new upward trend. Before confirming a long-term bullish reversal, Solana still has some ground to cover as seen by the downward trend of the 200- and 100-day moving averages.As is often the case prior to a possible breakout, volume analysis reveals a decline in trading volume during the most recent consolidation phase. Relative strength index (RSI) values around 50 indicate that the asset is neither oversold nor overbought.The price could move in either direction, as indicated by this neutral position, but the current support levels offer a promising future. In order to verify a reversal, Solana must make a strong break above the $170 resistance level.

Using data from analytics platform Santiment, Martinez says that the sudden DOGE accumulation of whales comes as sentiment for the leading memecoin has dropped close to 2024 lows.
“Market sentiment for Dogecoin is as bearish as it was in early February, just before DOGE skyrocketed by 200%!”

Notcoin Surpasses Major Meme Tokens in Onchain Holders and Price Surge



                    

The recently introduced Telegram-linked cryptocurrency, Notcoin (NOT), has been making waves in the crypto market due to its notable price surge. 



On May 30, 2024, a significant milestone was announced via X (formerly known as Twitter), stating that Notcoin’s onchain holder count has surpassed that of other popular meme tokens like Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Pepe.




The announcement detailed that Notcoin now boasts 1.6 million onchain holders, surpassing Shiba Inu’s 1.4 million, Bonk’s 731,000, and Pepe’s 235,000. 



This substantial increase is a testament to the growing investor interest and confidence in Notcoin.



The rise in Notcoin’s onchain holders coincides with a sharp increase in its price. 




Over the past 24 hours, the price of NOT has soared by 28%, currently trading near $0.0116. 



This surge is part of a broader trend observed over the past week, with NOT experiencing a 130% increase, despite a 20% decline over the past month.



The positive price movement of Notcoin is partly attributed to a recent promotional staking offer, which has since concluded, signaling strong market demand.

Technical analysis suggests that NOT is on a bullish trajectory, evidenced by a significant breakout and the closing of its first daily candle in positive territory.



The optimism surrounding Notcoin is further bolstered by external factors such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. 



Given that NOT is built on the Ethereum blockchain, this development could have indirect positive implications for its value.



In contrast, other major meme coins are struggling to maintain momentum. 



Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), dogwifhat (WIF), and Bonk (BONK) have seen declines of 3.54%, 2.5%, 4.5%, 7.5%, and 10% respectively over the same period.



This comparative performance emphasizes Notcoin’s recent success not only in expanding its onchain holder base but also in achieving substantial price gains, distinguishing it from its peers in the volatile meme coin market.

Musk's Cyborg (MUSKCYB) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Musk’s Cyborg could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.



Musk’s Cyborg (MUSKCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because MUSKCYB has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Musk’s Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin.



Musk’s Cyborg launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Musk’s Cyborg on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Cyborg by entering its contract address – zA67dhDYz4AzQ2rtfySpq7SNCo8aopw64AjuDbGfo6q – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCYB.

Why 'struggling' Bitcoin may be good news for market's memecoins now - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin discussions seem to be slipping, with traders now more focused on altcoins
Memecoin mania going strong, but this could be a warning for traders

Bitcoin [BTC] has retraced almost all of its gains after breaking out past the $67k resistance level on 20 May. It extended upwards to $71.9k, but fell to test $67k again on 23 May.
This consolidation implies that Bitcoin’s bullish strength is not as high as investors would have hoped. In fact, a recent AMBCrypto report explored some relevant Bitcoin metrics, finding that many of them remained bearish.
Memecoins have succeeded in capturing the public interest

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Santiment shared some insights into the crypto trends on social media. Memecoins have captured more of the public’s attention since mid-April due to their superior performance as a sector.
Tokens like dogwifhat [WIF], FLOKI [FLOKI], and Shiba Inu [SHIB] registered good performances over the past week. Pepe [PEPE] also saw remarkable gains over the past two weeks, with the altcoin up by 63% since 20 April. This came at a time when Bitcoin tried to break past $67k, but did not see a strongly bullish result.
The heavy engagement with memecoins could be a sign that the market is greedy and speculative and not in a phase of organic development, one where the public pursues tokens with good tech and utility.
Now, the Bitcoin ETF inflows have been positive lately and the month of May ended well too. However, it remains to be seen if that is enough to begin another rally this week.

The data also showed that Bitcoin discussions were sliding downward. According to Santiment, this was because traders have been increasingly fixated on altcoins for potential gains while Bitcoin dithered below the $70k resistance.
Large-cap momentum was bullish for the most part

The RSI on the 1-day interval revealed that most of the major tokens were near or above the neutral 50-mark, signaling bullishness. Ethereum [ETH] and Solana [SOL] were the strongest with readings of 67 and 55, respectively.
Meanwhile, Cardano [ADA], XRP, and Avalanche [AVAX] struggled to gain bullish traction on the charts.

Here, it is also worth noting that the trading volume of major altcoins has fallen dramatically, when compared to March. Crypto analyst Axel Adler pointed this out in a post on X, claiming that Bitcoin’s lack of momentum has been affecting sentiment across the market.

The volatility and trading volume behind Bitcoin has declined since March, and the price continues to trade within the range of $60k-$72k. Investors need to be patient, while traders need to watch out for range formations and not get caught out by false breakouts.

XRP is struggling to start a fresh increase above the $0.5250 resistance zone.
The price is now trading below $0.5150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.5180 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair could continue to move down if the price stays below $0.5250.

XRP Price Extends Losses
XRP price remained in a short-term bearish zone like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price struggled to start a recovery wave and extended losses below the $0.5220 support zone.
It even declined below the $0.5120 support. A low was formed at $0.5080 and the price is now attempting a fresh recovery wave. There was a move above the $0.5120 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5405 swing high to the $0.5080 low.
However, the price is still trading below $0.520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.5180 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.5180 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.
The first key resistance is near $0.5250 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5405 swing high to the $0.5080 low. A close above the $0.5250 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.5320.

If there is a close above the $0.5320 resistance level, there could be a steady increase toward the $0.5450 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5650 resistance.
More Downsides?
If XRP fails to clear the $0.5180 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5120 level.
The next major support is at $0.5080. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5080 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could decline and retest the $0.50 support in the near term.

PEPELSOL currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Tether Dominates Polygon's Stablecoin Market with $792M Cap, Growing 29% QoQ


																Polygon has witnessed a remarkable surge in its stablecoin market capitalization this quarter.
According to the latest report from Messari, the Ethereum Layer 2 solution’s stablecoin market cap soared to a whopping $1.5 billion, reflecting a significant 19% increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
Stablecoin Adoption on Polygon Soars
Tether’s solidified its position as the dominant stablecoin on Polygon, with its market cap growing by an impressive 29% QoQ to reach $792 million, according to Messari’s report. This accounted for a significant 53% of the total stablecoin market cap on the network.
This growth in stablecoin adoption on Polygon has been further boosted by several notable developments during the period.
For instance, In April, Sony Bank initiated trials exploring the use of stablecoins on the Polygon blockchain, with the end goal of evaluating their potential as a settlement method for digital sales across the Sony Group, including video games.




Additionally, the Belgian tech company Settlemint announced plans to develop a stablecoin leveraging Polygon, further underscoring the Layer 2 network’s growing prominence in the stablecoin ecosystem.
“Polygon’s stablecoin market cap increased to $1.5 billion, marking a 19% growth QoQ. USDT extended its position as the leading stablecoin, with its market cap growing by 29% QoQ to $792 million, representing 53% of the total stablecoin market cap.”
Gaming, DeFi, and NFT on Polygon
The gaming sector on Polygon also flourished during the first quarter of 2024. Messari observed that the number of daily active addresses associated with gaming on the platform skyrocketed by 1,615% quarter-over-quarter, reaching 207,000 addresses.
Additionally, the daily gaming transactions on Polygon experienced a 469% QoQ increase, climbing to 734,000 transactions. This growth in gaming activity was primarily driven by the immense popularity of MATR1X’s MATR1X FIRE game.
Beyond the gaming sector, Polygon’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem also experienced notable growth, with the number of daily active DeFi addresses increasing by 67% QoQ to reach 50,000 addresses.
While the non-fungible token (NFT) and social sectors also saw an uptick in activity, their scale remained relatively smaller compared to the gaming and DeFi domains within the Polygon ecosystem during the same period.

Doge Loves Trump (DOTRUMP) Coin to Surge 11,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Doge Loves Trump (DOTRUMP) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Doge Loves Trump (DOTRUMP), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Loves Trump presents a similar opportunity.



Doge Loves Trump has a market cap below $10,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Doge Loves Trump could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Doge Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Doge Loves Trump on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Loves Trump by entering its contract address – AQSeJZGNc2UD9okyyy6uWmUGdxKK1DYrr7eEQ9mstQbc – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOTRUMP.

Coinbase Accuses SEC of Stifling Crypto Industry with Regulation-by-Enforcement Strategy



                    

Coinbase has accused the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of employing a regulation-by-enforcement strategy to deliberately stifle the cryptocurrency industry. 



In a May 31 filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals, Coinbase critiqued the SEC’s reluctance to establish clear and equitable regulations for the crypto sector, which they argue is intended to “choke” the industry’s growth.




In the document, Coinbase expressed frustration with the SEC’s approach, stating, “The SEC is serious about the destruction of digital assets.” 



The filing highlighted the agency’s apparent disinterest in negotiating fair rules, noting that giving the SEC more opportunities to clarify its position would be “both pointless and exquisitely undeserved.”



Coinbase also argued that the SEC does not see it as its responsibility to ensure compliance is feasible, claiming that the agency finds its current rules “workable enough” as evidenced by its litigation against various firms for rule violations. 




This stance was reinforced by the mention of other SEC Commissioners who agree that the SEC’s actions are detrimental to the progress of digital assets and innovation.



The situation has been further complicated by legal actions the SEC has taken against firms like Coinbase. In June 2023, the SEC sued Coinbase for operating without proper registrations as a broker, securities exchange, or clearing agency. 



Despite efforts to dismiss the lawsuit, Coinbase has faced opposition from the SEC at every turn.

Even with a forecast by Bloomberg’s senior litigation analyst Elliott Stein, suggesting a 70% likelihood of a full dismissal, the case remains unresolved.



Amidst these tensions, SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce has proposed solutions like a cross-border sandbox program to facilitate cooperation between U.S. and U.K. firms experimenting with tokenized securities. 



During a panel at Consensus 2024, Pierce criticized the SEC’s unyielding bureaucracy, noting, “One of the problems that we’ve had is that people have tried to come into the SEC to get relief, but, you know, you sort of come in, and nothing happens. 



“This would […] force the SEC’s hand a little bit.”



While Coinbase acknowledges that the SEC’s stringent rules might only affect a small portion of the market, it argues that the overall approach remains oppressive. 



The company and other stakeholders in the crypto industry continue to push for fairer regulatory treatment as the SEC maintains its stringent stance.

Veteran Trader Predicts Bitcoin to Reach $150,000 by 2025


A well-known trading veteran, Peter L. Brandt, recently shared a bold forecast for Bitcoin. According to Brandt, Bitcoin could surge to $150,000 by September 2025.
This prediction stems from historical patterns observed in Bitcoin’s market cycles, specifically related to its “halving” events.
Bitcoin’s Halving Events: A Symmetrical Cycle

In his latest analysis, titled “The Beautiful Symmetry of Past Bitcoin Bull Market Cycles,” Brandt emphasizes the crucial role of Bitcoin’s halving dates. These events, where mining rewards are halved, have historically marked the midpoints of Bitcoin’s bull market cycles. Brandt notes that the time intervals from the start of a bull market to the halving dates closely mirror the intervals from the halving dates to the subsequent market peaks.

“More specifically, the number of weeks from the start of each bull market cycle (the low following a 75%-plus decline) to the Halving dates has been almost equal to the number of weeks from the Halving dates to the subsequent bull market highs,” he wrote.

If this pattern holds, Brandt forecasted that Bitcoin could reach its next peak around late August or early September 2025. He suggests that the price might soar to between $130,000 and $150,000, following an inverted parabolic curve that has characterized previous bull markets.
However, Brandt remains cautious, acknowledging that no analysis method is infallible. He assigns a 25% probability that Bitcoin has already peaked for this cycle. He advises traders to monitor Bitcoin’s performance closely, particularly if it fails to achieve a new all-time high and drops below $55,000.
Other prominent analysts also share optimistic outlooks for Bitcoin. Crypto technical analyst CryptoCon points to the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator as a critical metric for identifying cycle tops and bottoms.
According to CryptoCon, Bitcoin’s price reached levels in March 2024, consistent with the initial tops seen in previous cycles. This indicates room for further growth.
Renowned crypto analyst PlanB also supports a bullish view. He highlighted Bitcoin’s post-halving performance in June, noting its alignment with the Stock-to-Flow model.

Based on his analysis, Bitcoin is still on track to be in a bull market post-halving. PlanB highlighted that Bitcoin shows a similar pattern in the Stock-to-Flow model to the three previous halvings.

“The big change in the Stock-to-Flow and the Stock-to-Flow model outcome is around the halvings. So, big jump around the halving in the model value and then a price of Bitcoin that shows a little bit of a lag, but it eventually catches up with that model value, and that is exactly what happened in the last three halvings, and I expect [it] will be happening next year,” PlanB said.

Musk's Cyborg (MUSKCYB) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Musk’s Cyborg could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.



Musk’s Cyborg (MUSKCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because MUSKCYB has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Musk’s Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin.



Musk’s Cyborg launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Musk’s Cyborg on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Cyborg by entering its contract address – zA67dhDYz4AzQ2rtfySpq7SNCo8aopw64AjuDbGfo6q – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCYB.

Industry Pushback Leads Matter Labs to Drop ZK Trademark


Matter Labs, the entity behind Ethereum layer-2 (L2) scaling solution zkSync, has dropped its attempt to trademark the term “ZK.”
The decision came after leading researchers and community members criticized the move.
Strong Opposition from Industry Experts and the Community

After facing intense criticism, Matter Labs announced on June 2 via a post on X (formerly Twitter) that they would withdraw all trademark applications related to ZK. The company acknowledged the challenge of establishing a group perceived as neutral and fair by the global community.

“As a result of these conversations, we decided to drop all trademark applications for the term ‘ZK.’ These discussions came down to one important fact: it would be impossible to agree on a group of people perceived as credibly neutral by nearly everyone. What could have worked for Ethereum would not necessarily work for the entire world,” Matter Labs wrote.

Read more: What Is zkSync?
Matter Labs initially said it applied for ZK-related trademark applications in nine countries to claim “zero-knowledge.” Zero-knowledge (ZK) technology uses cryptographic protocols to allow one party to prove a statement’s truth to another without revealing any specific information about the statement itself, ensuring privacy and security.
The company argued the application aimed to ensure ZK can be used freely in the context of “zkSync,” “ZK Stack,” and other firm-related names. However, efforts to solidify its ownership over ZK technology sparked significant criticism from the crypto community.
Several prominent figures in the ZK technology industry issued a joint public letter to address their concerns about Matter Labs. In the letter, they emphasized the importance of keeping ZK technology for the public good. They argued that commercializing such a fundamental technology would go against the principles of freedom and openness that the crypto industry stands for.

“ZK shouldn’t be a trademark of a corporation: it should rather be accessible to all. Those of us that work on ZK technology understand that we are standing on the shoulders of giants, of researchers and engineers that created and developed the technology that we use. In return, we are asked to contribute back to a body of knowledge that is owned by the collective, not by a single corporation,” the public letter reads.


The letter’s signatories included Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali, co-inventors of ZK proofs. Other key industry leaders, like Eli Ben-Sasson, CEO of StarkWare, and Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, also endorsed the letter.
The disagreement over Matter Labs’ trademark applications resonated deeply within the broader crypto community. Data from the Web3 information platform Kaito showed a significant dip in the sentiment analytics score for zkSync, reflecting the community’s negative response in the last few days of May.

Despite the backlash, zkSync is one of the most popular L2 solutions in the Ethereum ecosystem. Growthepie data reveals that zkSync has 767,730 weekly active addresses, representing a 10.2% share of total L2 addresses.

Matter Labs Trademark Application Now Withdrawn Amid ZK Community Controversy - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Matter Labs trademark applications for “ZK” have been withdrawn after backlash from the ZK community.



Leading ZK figures, including co-inventors of ZK proofs and Polygon leaders, condemned the move.



Matter Labs acknowledged the community’s concerns and decided to drop the applications to maintain harmony.




Matter Labs, the company behind zkSync, has decided to withdraw all trademark applications for the term “ZK.”



Matter Labs Trademark Application Now Withdrawn Amid ZK Community Controversy 4



Matter Labs Trademark Applications Now Withdrawn



The Matter Labs trademark application withdrawal decision was made after significant backlash from leading figures in the zero-knowledge (ZK) community, who argued that ZK technologies should remain a public good accessible to all.



The controversy began when Matter Labs trademark applications were filed for “ZK” in nine countries, asserting exclusive intellectual property rights over the term “zero-knowledge.” Notable critics included Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali, co-inventors of ZK proofs, and leaders from Polygon and StarkWare, such as Sandeep Nailwal and Brendan Farmer, and Eli Ben-Sasson. 



They collectively issued a statement condemning Matter Labs’ actions, emphasizing that ZK should not be monopolized by any single corporation and must remain a public good. They also warned that going through with the trademark would alienate Matter Labs from the ZK community.




The trademark controversy emerged just as zkSync was preparing for a highly anticipated airdrop in mid-June. Coinciding with Polyhedra’s use of the ZKJ ticker for its own token listing further complicated matters. Polyhedra, Polygon, and StarkWare reiterated that ZK should not be a corporate trademark but should continue serving as a public resource.



Matter Labs Responds to Community Backlash



In response to the criticism, Matter Labs announced on June 2 via a post on X (formerly Twitter) that it would abandon its trademark efforts. The company acknowledged the difficulty in establishing a neutral body to manage such trademarks globally and recognized that what might work for Ethereum wouldn’t necessarily apply universally.



Matter Labs emphasized that its intent was to protect the term “ZK” within the scope of its projects, such as ZK Sync and ZK Stack, without restricting its broader use in the community. Despite this, the firm conceded to the community’s concerns and decided to drop all trademark applications.

Crypto Analyst Says Historic Move Imminent for Bitcoin, Predicts Steep and Rapid Rallies for BTC - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto strategist known for macro Bitcoin calls thinks that BTC is gearing up for a big price explosion en route to a blow-off top.
Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 456,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s trading range on the five-day chart is at its tightest level in eight years.










A tight trading range in a bullish trend suggests that buying activity is inching closer to sellers’ desired price level, causing price compression that often leads to a breakout. TechDev uses logarithmic Bollinger bands to quantify Bitcoin’s volatility history.
Says TechDev,
“Historic move imminent.
Bitcoin’s five-day bullish compression has reached its highest level in eight years.” 
Source: TechDev/X
As Bitcoin’s trading range becomes narrow, TechDev says the ensuing breakout will likely lead to steep and rapid rallies. The analyst highlights the BTC versus M1 money supply chart, which he says recently witnessed a “textbook breakout.”
According to TechDev, the breakout suggests that Bitcoin will ignite a parabolic surge and end this cycle with a blow-off top similar to what happened during the 2017, 2015 and 2013 bull markets.
“Significant.
Bitcoin has only seen blow-off tops after breakouts against M1 money supply.
And the longer it’s consolidated, the longer it’s run.
This breakout follows the longest consolidation yet.
In fact, it represents a textbook breakout of a five-year broadening wedge.
The last five years have been corrective against M1. BTC is once again impulsive against it for the first time since 2017.
We’ve never seen a Bitcoin breakout like this one.” 
Source: TechDev/X
M1 money supply tracks the amount of liquidity sloshing in the US financial system by summing up all physical money including coins and currency, demand deposits, traveler’s checks and other checkable deposits.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $69,060, up more than 1% in the past day.

May NFT sales post worst performance since October


Global non-fungible token (NFT) sales totaled US$604 million in May, the lowest monthly performance since last October and the first month this year with sales below US$1 billion.



Ethereum, the world’s leading blockchain for NFT sales with a historic sales volume of over US$43 billion, had US$164 million in sales last month, its lowest since September.



The network must look even further back in time to match its latest number of unique buyers. 



Last month, Ethereum had 56,914 unique buyers, according to CryptoSlam data, the blockchain’s lowest NFT buyer count since June 2021.

	
	
	
	


The NFT sales slump was also apparent on the Bitcoin network, which had US$160 million in monthly sales, the lowest since October. It saw a decline in both buyers and sellers, recording the lowest count this year.



While the sales slump was evident in most major blockchains, Solana bucked the trend in terms of activity. 



Solana had US$93 million in monthly sales, the first time the blockchain recorded under US$100 million since last November. 



Solana set new records for monthly unique buyers and sellers, with 346,229 and 594,555 addresses respectively. 

	
	
	

	


However, the network’s average NFT price is falling. Its US$37.8 average monthly sales value is the lowest this year.

Can Solana reignite 'Solana Summer' amid price stagnation? - AMBCrypto



SOL is currently consolidating, trading between $165 and $190.
SOL needs to decisively break past the 200-day moving average to confirm a continuation of its bullish trend.

Solana [SOL] has been the cryptocurrency market’s best performer in the past year. Solana’s memecoins have been major catalysts of this bull cycle, and the crypto community is even calling this summer “Solana Summer.”
 However, as of press time, SOL hasn’t seen an increase in over a week.
Source: CoinGecko
Solana’s struggle
The consistent trading range for SOL prices between $165 and $190 over several days highlights a consolidation phase.
The derivatives data for SOL reveals a mix of increasing interest and declining trading volumes, reflecting a cautious yet attentive trading environment.
Source: Coinglass
Interestingly, the data on ‘rekt’ (losses from liquidated positions) shows minimal losses on short positions in the last hour, suggesting that downward price movements were not severe enough to trigger massive short liquidations. 
In other words, the bulls are still majorly in control.
Source: Coinglass
Turning our attention to social volume data from Santiment, we see massive spikes, particularly around March. It likely had to do with Bitcoin breaking two all-time highs that month. 
Source: Santiment
However, in recent days, there’s been a noticeable decline in social volume. The Solana Fear and Greed Index presents a neutral sentiment at 45%. 
Source: CFGI
SOL’s price is currently hovering just above its 50-day moving average (MA50), suggesting a tentative hold in bullish territory but struggling to maintain upward momentum. 
The 200-day moving average (MA200) sits slightly above the current price, serving as a possible resistance zone that SOL needs to breach to stage a bullish takeover.
Source: TradingView
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) near the midpoint (around 47) aligns with this consolidation.

Read Solana’s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-25

Solana must break past the $190 level to turn the current resistance into support and initiate a stronger rally.
All in all, we see a market that is hesitantly bullish but not fully committed, likely due to SOL’s recent performance plateau. This could lead to continued consolidation until a new catalyst either confirms a bullish continuation or initiates a bearish reversal.

Pepe Loves Solana (PEPELSOL) Memecoin to Explode 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Solana (PEPELSOL) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Pepe Loves Solana (PEPELSOL), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




PEPELSOL will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Pepe Loves Solana.



Currently, Pepe Loves Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy PEPELSOL on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Solana by entering its contract address – 5wjHhZyWzpCgCr7DtSwctAEH8ujGkJYuyXG9DeQKnX6R – in the receiving field.



PEPELSOL currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Whales Transfer Trillions of SHIB Tokens, Triggering Price Fluctuations and Strategic Burns in the Crypto Market



                    

Recent data highlights significant activities involving Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens, with large holders or “whales” moving trillions of tokens to various cryptocurrency exchanges. 



From mid-May to the end of the month, the volume of SHIB on trading platforms escalated from 144 trillion to over 147.5 trillion coins.




This transfer of over four trillion SHIB, valued at approximately $103 million, suggests notable market behaviors. 



On May 29, a significant price fluctuation was observed as SHIB’s price spiked to $0.000029, marking a 21% increase. 



This peak was followed by a decline of 12.16%, likely influenced by substantial sell-offs. The latest trading data shows SHIB at around $0.00002584.




The Shibburn tracking platform has also reported an uptick in SHIB burning activities. 



In recent efforts, nearly 9.85 million SHIB were sent to irretrievable addresses in 13 transactions. 



Notable among these were burns of 2.92 million, 2 million, and 1.5 million SHIB. 



These actions are part of an ongoing effort by the SHIB community to reduce the circulating supply and potentially boost the token’s value.

Highlighting the history of such activities, three years ago, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin performed a significant burn of 410 trillion SHIB, a move that decisively impacted the SHIB ecosystem. 



This event took place in 2021 after Buterin received half of the total SHIB supply from its anonymous creator, Ryoshi. 



Buterin decided to destroy most of these tokens, allocating the remainder—90 trillion SHIB—to a crypto charity supporting pandemic relief in India. 



This monumental burn is often mentioned as a crucial moment that enhanced SHIB’s reputation in the cryptocurrency market.



In summary, the recent movements of SHIB by whales and the community’s burning initiatives represent strategic maneuvers aimed at affecting the token’s market dynamics. 



As the cryptocurrency environment evolves, these activities are expected to continually influence SHIB’s valuation and its standing in the digital asset realm.

Shiba Inu Team Urges 'Extreme Caution', Here's Why


								The Shiba Inu team issued a stern warning against a rising tide of fraudulent activities targeting the Shibarium platform. Digarch (@Digarch) posted via X, “SHIBARMY extreme caution is advised in these volatile times,” and referred to DaVinci, a prominent member of the Shiba Inu team. He communicated his warning through a series of posts on Discord, addressing the entire Shibarium community.
Shiba Inu Users Must Be Very Vigilant
DaVinci’s initial message detailed the new sophisticated tactics employed by fraudsters: “It has come to our attention that deceitful individuals are launching tokens falsely claiming involvement with Shiba developers and the future of Shibarium. These malicious actors have now shifted tactics, moving from the misuse of Ryoshi Research mediums to the exploitation of Shiba State and Canine code.”
Fraudsters have reportedly escalated their schemes by associating themselves with the official Shiba site, shib.io, using its address in their promotional videos to lend unwarranted credibility.

In response to these activities, DaVinci stressed the importance of vigilance and informed decision-making: “We urge you to exercise caution and conduct comprehensive research before engaging with any tokens. To be clear, Treat has not been launched yet. Any tokens claiming association with it are attempting to deceive and defraud the community.”
One of the core challenges highlighted by this incident is the decentralized nature of Shibaswap, the platform’s native decentralized exchange, which inherently limits the ability of the Shiba Inu team to directly intervene and ban fraudulent tokens. Despite this, the team is actively taking steps to publicly denounce these scams and discourage community members from engaging with them.
Expanding on the need for critical evaluation, DaVinci posted a follow-up message emphasizing the dangers of blindly following influential personalities within the Shibarium ecosystem. “I’ve seen too many projects that receive glowing endorsements from well-known X personalities only to collapse later. This underscores a fundamental truth: the longevity and resilience of a project are key indicators of its foundation. If a project can’t withstand a few months, it likely wasn’t built on a solid foundation,” he explained.

DaVinci further cautioned against recurrent patterns of failure observed in some project leaders, indicating potential red flags for investors: “Be cautious of individuals who repeatedly fail with one project and quickly move on to launch another. This pattern should raise red flags. Ask yourself: Does the new project have what it takes to succeed? Is there genuine demand? Is the community robust and engaged? Is there sufficient funding for sustainable development?”
He advised the Shibarium users to assess projects based on technical merits, including scalability, security protocols, and the feasibility of their roadmaps. The ability of the team to navigate the complex landscape of blockchain technology and its commitment to the project are critical for success.
DaVinci concluded his advisory by reminding the community of the inherent risks of cryptocurrency investments: “Remember, investing in crypto is a long-term game. Be mindful of the risks and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Your due diligence and prudent decision-making are paramount to navigating this volatile space successfully.”
At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00002474.

Binance Token Delistings Signal Shift in Crypto Exchange Standards


							

Binance has decided to delist and stop the trading of OMG, WAVES, WNXM, and XEM pairs.



The platform’s decision follows a periodical review that verifies certain factors and assures the standards of tokens.



The exchange has stopped the cash payment feature in its Indian branch, aligning with the government’s regulatory requirements.




Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has decided to delist several tokens, including OmiseGo (OMG), Waves (WAVES), Wrapped NXM (WNXM), and NEM (XEM). According to Binance’s official announcement, the exchange will remove all spot and margin trading pairs for these tokens on June 17, 2024.



Binance periodically reviews the digital assets listed on its platform. The exchange verifies certain factors to ensure that tokens meet a high level of standard and industry requirements. These factors include development activity, commitment, trading volume and liquidity, regulatory adherence, and public communication. Binance added:




 “When a coin or token no longer meets these standards or the industry landscape changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it. Our priority is to ensure the best services and protections for our users while continuing to adapt to evolving market dynamics.” 




The specific trading pairs being removed from Binance are:




OMG/USDT



WAVES/BTC



WAVES/ETH



WAVES/TRY



WAVES/USDT



WNXM/USDT



XEM/USDT.




The exchange announced that deposits of these tokens will not be credited to user accounts after June 18. Additionally, the platform will not support withdrawals of these tokens after September 18, 2024.



Meanwhile, Binance India closed its cash payment feature, aligning with the government’s insistence on stricter regulatory compliance. Binance’s move aims to mitigate the risks of peer-to-peer cash transactions, as noted by Purushottam Anand, founder of Crypto Legal, a Bengaluru-based blockchain and crypto-focused law firm. Anand said, “P2P cash transactions, with or without the involvement of any exchange, expose parties to serious physical and financial risk.” He added:




 “There have been cases where traders have been physically assaulted and forced to transfer their virtual assets or hand over cash during physical meetings. Victims hesitate in filing criminal complaints due to regulatory uncertainty regarding the legality of such cash transactions.”




Binance’s regular token review and amendments demonstrate the platform’s commitment to regulatory norms. The exchange prioritizes the security and privacy of its clients, avoiding any potential breach of security laws.

Solana's Answer To Dogecoin Is Correcting But Analyst Says It Could Be Confirmation That Bonk Has More Upside (CORRECTED) - Benzinga

Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect the correct spelling of Bonk coin.Dog-themed memecoin Bonk BONK/USD has corrected since hitting its peak last week, but an analyst feels such retests are great confirmation signals for further upside.What Happened: On Sunday, prominent cryptocurrency trader Rekt Capital took to X, formerly Twitter, to express his views on the trajectory of the Solana SOL/USD-based token. He suggested that the cryptocurrency could see a bit more downside in June, which could potentially lead to a macro retest of its previous breakout range.This viewpoint comes in the wake of BONK’s continued slide ever since it recorded its all-time high of $0.000043 last week. See Also: Massive Shiba Inu Burn Ignites Hope For Price Recovery Despite Market DownturnA few days ago, Rekt Capital noticed a pattern in BONK’s trajectory in which it retests old range highs as support after breaking out.“Post-breakout retests don’t always happen, especially when the buy-side pressure is strong, but such retests are great confirmation signals for further upside,” the analyst had said.Why It Matters: Despite the pullback, BONK’s recent performance has been noteworthy. The coin was one of the biggest market gainers over the last month, and the third-best performing memecoin in the period, with gains of more than 23%.In doing so, BONK outperformed senior dog-themed cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USDThe number of traders taking bullish long positions for BONK in the derivatives market started to increase in the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass, reflecting confidence in the coin’s upsides. Price Action: At the time of writing, BONK was trading at $0.00003232, following a 3.5% drop in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Image via ShutterstockRead Next: Roaring Kitty’s’ New Social Post Pushes GameStop-Themed Crypto By 200%, Kitty-Themed Coins SurgeDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

Six Things to Watch This Week as Bitcoin's Price Inches Toward $69K


																This is the last week of employment data before the June 12 Federal Reserve meeting kicks off.
Investors will examine several economic reports that will be incorporated into the Fed’s future policy considerations. Friday’s crucial job market reports will be one to watch.
Crypto markets have gone through the weekend with very little movement either way for most digital assets.
Economic Events June 3-7
Monday will see May’s ISM Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index) report which shows business conditions in the U.S. manufacturing sector.
This data is considered a reliable leading indicator for assessing the state of the U.S. economy and can be used to help anticipate changing economic trends.
The services sector may be considered more important as it contributes over 70% of the U.S. GDP. On Wednesday, the May ISM Services PMI will be released, which will also serve as a leading indicator of changes in economic conditions.


Friday’s Payrolls and Unemployment reports from the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics provide the number of new jobs created during the previous month, along with the percentage of active employment seekers.
These are the most significant reports of the week as policymakers follow these figures which are strongly associated with the overall health of the economy. The Fed also pays close attention to the labor market changes when determining its policy decisions.
“It will be key to see whether the US labor market continues cooling,” commented Global Macro Investor before adding:
“Wall Street analysts expect 180,000 new jobs to be added and the unemployment rate to stay at 3.9%. Meanwhile, revised US labor market data already points to a recession.”
Crypto Market Outlook
It is unlikely that this week’s employment and economic reports will have much of an impact on crypto markets, which are more closely affected by CPI inflation reports.
Total market capitalization hasn’t moved much over the past few days and remains at $2.68 trillion.
However, Bitcoin prices started to move upwards during the Monday morning Asian trading session, adding 1.4% on the day to reach $68,619 at the time of writing. It has remained tightly rangebound since it failed to top $70,000 again in late May.
Ethereum had recovered minor losses to return to $3,800 and the altcoins were mostly flat aside from Toncoin which added 10% over the past 24 hours.

Exploring the Impact: How a $500,000 Bitcoin Could Skyrocket Shiba Inu's Market Value



                    

The cryptocurrency market, with its frequent and often dramatic fluctuations, presents an intriguing scenario of Bitcoin potentially reaching $500,000 and the ensuing effects on altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB).



 This analysis delves into the implications of such a milestone for Bitcoin and its ripple effects on SHIB’s pricing structure.




Bitcoin is regarded as the benchmark for the digital currency landscape, often influencing trends across the cryptocurrency market. 



Historical data suggests that spikes in Bitcoin’s price precede similar movements in altcoins. 



With Bitcoin having already surpassed its previous peak by hitting $73,000 in March 2024, speculation about its future trajectory continues to captivate analysts and investors alike.




Several prominent industry experts have voiced their predictions, creating a broad spectrum of possibilities for Bitcoin’s peak. 



Mike Novogratz and Robert Kiyosaki suggest a future price of $100,000. 



More conservative estimates by figures like Richard Teng and Standard Chartered place it around $150,000.

Meanwhile, Raoul Pal envisions it reaching $250,000, and Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest proposes a bold forecast of $1 million within the next six years, a sentiment echoed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.



In a scenario where Bitcoin reaches $500,000, its market capitalization would soar from $1.330 trillion to an impressive $9.85 trillion. 



This growth would likely catalyze significant gains for altcoins, including Shiba Inu. 



If SHIB’s market cap were to increase by 650.7%, similar to Bitcoin’s, it would climb from its current $14.3 billion to around $93 billion.



Under these conditions, Shiba Inu’s price could theoretically rise to $0.000166 per token, up from its current price of $0.000024, based on its circulating supply of approximately 589 trillion tokens. 



This price adjustment would be necessary to achieve the projected market cap of $93 billion, highlighting the potential scale of impact a high Bitcoin valuation could have on smaller cryptocurrencies like SHIB.



However, it’s important to stress the speculative nature of these projections. 



Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, and numerous external factors such as technological advancements, regulatory changes, and shifts in market sentiment could dramatically alter SHIB’s price trajectory. 



The interconnectedness of Bitcoin’s movements with the broader crypto market adds another layer of complexity to these predictions, making any forecast highly conjectural.

US Senator Ted Cruz Has Officially Become a Bitcoin (BTC) Miner


																U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, a long-time supporter of crypto, has announced the purchase of three application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) Bitcoin miners, initiating mining operations in Iraan, Texas.
Notably, Cruz has been an outspoken advocate for pro-crypto legislation.
Ted Cruz Joins Bitcoin Miners
In the announcement, made on X, the Senator said that he had joined the ranks of Texas Bitcoin miners, a post that was accompanied by a picture of his mining setup.


Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel praised Cruz’s initiative, welcoming him to the Bitcoin mining community. He also highlighted his contribution to improving network security.




Texas supports Bitcoin mining due to its business-friendly laws and affordable energy resources, including wind, solar, and natural gas. The environment has increased Bitcoin mining in smaller towns like Iraan, creating jobs, boosting energy infrastructure investments, and generating tax revenue.
A financial disclosure revealed that Cruz bought Bitcoin worth between $15,000 and $50,000 on January 25, when the price was around $37,000. With Bitcoin currently trading at $69,000, his investment stands well in the green, assuming he hasn’t sold his holdings.
Meanwhile, Cruz is not the only lawmaker embracing crypto. Several senators have disclosed their crypto holdings, reflecting growing political support. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis has allocated funds in Bitcoin, purchasing approximately $250,000 worth, making her the most heavily invested U.S. lawmaker in the asset.
Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey, another crypto advocate, revealed his investments in Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF.
Ted Cruz’s Crypto Advocacy
In 2021, Ted Cruz opposed a crypto tax proposal in the Senate’s infrastructure bill, which aimed to raise about $28 billion in new tax revenue over a decade. He also introduced a resolution for merchants and vendors on Capitol Hill to accept cryptocurrency payments.
Cruz is also opposing the Federal Reserve’s development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). He has consistently introduced legislation to prevent the Fed from creating a CBDC, citing concerns about privacy, government overreach, and financial surveillance.
Meanwhile, Oklahoma lawmakers passed House Bill 1600 on May 30, offering tax credits to digital asset mining operations. Pending the governor’s signature, the bill aims to exempt commercial mining machinery, including servers, computers, and transformers, from taxes.
The Oklahoma Bitcoin Association emphasized the bill’s significance, stating it would make state power prices highly competitive for miners and attract investments to revitalize rural areas. The bill is expected to optimize Oklahoma’s electricity grid and reduce power costs for residents.

Toncoin: Does the surge in TON holders signal a shift in market sentiment? - AMBCrypto



The number of retail and large TON investors increased, triggering a notable price jump.
Open Interest climbed, indicating strength for the uptrend.

A renewed round of increases has hit Toncoin [TON], and this time it was not limited to the price or market cap.  Instead, AMBCrypto found that the number of addresses holding TON across every group increased.
According to on-chain data from Santiment, the number of holders with 0.01 to 1 TON in their portfolio jumped. The same goes for the whales who own 100,000 to 1 million tokens.
This is a rare sight to behold for any project. For Toncoin, it is good news and indicates there are more participants with the belief that TON’s price could trade higher.
Source: Santiment
All hands on deck in TON support
Three days ago, AMBCrypto reported how whales had flocked to the Toncoin network. Little did anyone know that the retail cohort was also looking to the cryptocurrency as a haven.
Interestingly, TON seemed to be in the mood to reward this loyalty. At press time, the price of the token was $ 6.59, representing an impressive 5.01% increase in the last 24 hours.
As a result, the total supply in profit jumped. As of this writing, the percentage of TON in profit was 79.04%.  A few weeks back, almost 100% of the Toncoin holders were in the green.
Source: Santiment
The selling pressure the token experienced was one of the reasons the ratio declined. But with the recent uptrend, TON could be walking its way back to $7.65.
However, there is a chance that Toncoin could trade higher as speculation of an altcoin season continues to spread.
The term “altcoin season” refers to the period when non-Bitcoin [BTC] cryptocurrencies experience a notable price surge more than BTC.
Can the price hit $15?
In this instance, at least 75% of the top 50 altcoins should outperform the king coin. If this is the case, TON’s return to $7 could be child’s play as the price might head for a double-digit value.
In addition to the metric above, AMBCrypto looked at TON’s Open Interest (OI). Open Interest is the value of all open contracts in the market
When the OI decreases, it means that a lot of traders are closing their existing positions. This takes money out of the market and could be bearish for the cryptocurrency.
For Toncoin, Coinglass data showed that the OI increased by 11.70% in the last 24 hours. This increase implied that new money was entering the market, and could be bullish for the token.

Should the indicator continue to move higher, TON’s price could surpass its all-time high, and a possible increase to $15 could be possible in the mid-term.
However, holders of the toke might need to watch out. If the OI grows too high, it could be a sign that a change is coming into the market, and selling off at that point could be a good option.

Telegram-Linked Notcoin Pips Solana, Dogecoin In Volumes To Become Fourth-Most Traded Crypto - Benzinga

Cryptocurrencies linked with social messaging giant Telegram like Toncoin TON/USD and Notcoin NOT/USD edged higher on Sunday, even as the broader market moved sideways.What Happened: NOT accumulated double-digit gains in the last 24 hours, with trading volumes spiking 141% to $4.43 billion. In fact, NOT was the fourth-most traded cryptocurrency in the last 24 hours, comprehensively beating top coins such as Solana SOL/USD and Dogecoin DOGE/USD. More than half of the volume came from Binance BNB/USD, the world's largest cryptocurrency trading platform.Over the week, the coin belonging to a popular play-to-earn Web3 game on Telegram, was up 275%. CryptocurrencyGains +/-Price (Recorded at 2:50 a.m. EDT)Notcoin NOT/USD+11.50%$0.02108Toncoin TON/USD+5.46%$6.71TON, the cryptocurrency belonging to the layer-1 blockchain The Open Network, also saw impressive gains in the last 24 hours.

Is This The Biggest Bitcoin Bull Run Ever? Analyst Says Yes!


																Crypto analyst TechDev (@TechDev_52) recently shared a detailed chart analysis suggesting that Bitcoin might be on the cusp of its most significant breakout to date. This analysis, backed by historical patterns and technical indicators, points to a potential shift in the market that could lead to unprecedented price levels for Bitcoin.
The chart provided by TechDev illustrates Bitcoin’s price action in USD alongside its price relative to the M1 money supply (BTC/M1). Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited distinct phases of parabolic price increases, known as “blowoff tops,” followed by sharp corrections. These blowoff tops are marked with green check marks on the chart, occurring in 2011, 2013, and 2017. Each of these peaks was followed by significant corrections.

Notably, the 2021 peak did not result in a blowoff top, as indicated by the red cross on the chart. This deviation from historical patterns is significant because it suggests a possible change in market behavior.
TechDev’s chart also highlights a key pattern known as the “descending right-angled broadening formation.” This technical pattern is characterized by a series of lower highs and lower lows, creating a broadening wedge shape. The pattern typically signals a period of consolidation, where the price oscillates within the broadening trend lines before a decisive breakout. The chart shows that Bitcoin has recently broken out of this broadening wedge, indicating a potential shift from a consolidation phase to a new bullish trend.

The analyst commented, “Significant. Bitcoin has only seen blow-off tops after breakouts against M1 money supply. And the longer it’s consolidated, the longer it’s run. This breakout follows the longest consolidation yet. In fact, it represents a textbook breakout of a 5 year broadening wedge. The last 5 years have been corrective against M1. BTC is once again impulsive against it for the first time since 2017. We’ve never seen a Bitcoin breakout like this one.”
Bitcoin Could Outpace The 2021 Cycle
Another critical aspect of TechDev’s analysis is the breakout of Bitcoin against the M1 money supply. The M1 money supply includes physical currency and checkable deposits, representing the most liquid forms of money in the economy. TechDev points out that Bitcoin has broken out against M1 for the first time since March 2017. This breakout is particularly significant because it suggests that Bitcoin’s recent price increase is driven by intrinsic demand rather than merely an increase in the money supply.

TechDev comments on this breakout, stating: “You’re looking at the first breakout of Bitcoin against M1 money supply since March 2017 when it went historically parabolic for 9 months. Comparisons and trend projections involving 2021 may end up dramatically underestimating things. One interpretation: In 2021 BTC was carried to new USD highs by increased money supply. In 2024 it’s gotten there on its own demand (and thus broke out against M1). Add the anticipated M1 growth this time and we likely see BTC outpace expectations based in part on 2021.”
TechDev’s analysis underscores the importance of understanding Bitcoin’s performance relative to macroeconomic indicators like the M1 money supply. By breaking out against M1, Bitcoin demonstrates strong intrinsic demand, which is a bullish signal for future price movements. The historical patterns of blowoff tops following similar breakouts suggest that Bitcoin could be entering a new phase of price discovery, potentially leading to new all-time highs.
At press time, BTC traded at $69,032.

MANTRA debuts a new RWA savings vault with Ondo


    MANTRA, a real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform, has unveiled a new RWA savings vault, an on-chain product backed by Ondo’s USDY, as per the information shared with Finbold on June 3. 



The new project brings together two prominent players in the RWA sector to bolster liquidity for RWA tokenization, a facet of decentralized finance (DeFi) that has recently garnered considerable institutional interest.



High-quality yields with a new multi-chain vault 



To mark the new liquidity milestone, MANTRA and the Ondo Foundation are incentivizing a multi-chain vault. 







Users who contribute USD Coin (USDC) to the vault will gain immediate access to high-quality yields. 



Those who stay invested until MANTRA Chain’s mainnet launch will also receive ONDO tokens and mainnet OM coins along with the underlying yield. 



The vault is expected to open to the public in June on Ethereum (ETH) and Base.



Institutional-grade DeFi composability



MANTRA’s mission is to merge DeFi composability with institutional-grade finance on-chain. 



USDY’s features, such as over-collateralization, third-party oversight, and institutional-grade investor protections, make it a cornerstone asset for the growing RWA ecosystem.



To manage returns effectively as participation increases, MANTRA and the Ondo Foundation have designed a ratcheting schedule of increasing rewards distributed as community participation milestones are achieved.



Nathan Allman, CEO of Ondo Finance, expressed his enthusiasm about the project, stating, 




“We are excited to see the USDY vault launching on MANTRA, furthering our mission to bring institutional-grade assets to the world. This yield-bearing vault is an exciting step in our journey to bridge traditional finance and decentralized finance at scale.”
— Nathan Allman, CEO of Ondo Finance




John Patrick Mullin, co-founder and CEO of MANTRA, further commented on the plan to create the most liquid Layer-1 blockchain built specifically for RWAs:




“Enabling Ondo USDY, the market-leading tokenized US treasury product, marks a significant expansion of our ecosystem. Having a fungible interest-bearing base layer of liquidity via USDY is critical to enhancing our on-chain liquidity profile. This cutting-edge product launch is part of MANTRA Chain’s broader strategy to work closely with all leading RWA projects to create the most liquid Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for RWAs.”
— John Patrick Mullin, co-founder and CEO of MANTRA




The launch of MANTRA’s new blockchain



MANTRA’s new blockchain, set to launch later this year, will feature Ondo’s flagship interest-bearing tokenized note, USDY, as its genesis asset. 



USDY offers holders exposure to short-term US Treasury yields while retaining the utility of stablecoins. 



Not being registered under the US Securities Act, USDY is not available for sale in the US or to US citizens.

Second term for the pro-Bitcoin President of El Salvador

The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, a supporter of Bitcoin, has been sworn in for a second term. 
Starting a new five-year period, Bukele has received the support of the cryptocurrency industry for his leadership, which is positioning the country as a “world leader”. Let’s see all the details below. 

El Salvador continues the Bitcoin revolution: President Bukele is re-elected
As anticipated, the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, a supporter of Bitcoin (BTC), has been sworn in for a second term presidential of five years, after a landslide victory in February. 
This event has generated great enthusiasm in the cryptocurrency sector, thanks to its favorable position towards Bitcoin. The crypto commentator Cory Bates in a post on June 1st stated: 
“It is the demonstration of his commitment: best wishes for another five years. God bless El Salvador.”
Also Pete Rizzo, an expert in crypto media, commented: 
“Exactly five years ago, Nayib Bukele became President of El Salvador. Since then, the country has become a world leader, a symbol of freedom, security, and innovation. The first Bitcoin president.”
The inauguration ceremony took place on June 1st at the National Palace of San Salvador, where Bukele highlighted the significant drop in crime during his term, attributing the credit to the tough crackdown on criminal gangs: 
“In two years, we resolved a situation that had remained unresolved for over half a century, with more than 70,000 terrorists controlling the country and causing more victims than the armed conflict.”
In addition to the support of the citizens for his efforts in the fight against crime, Bukele has also gained the support of the global cryptocurrency industry for the decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.
In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, following the approval of the Bitcoin law. However, initially, more than three-quarters of Salvadorans were skeptical, according to a Reuters survey from July 2021.
The majority of Bukele’s party consolidates power in El Salvador
According to the February data, the Nuove Idee party obtained 54 of the 60 seats in the legislature, giving Nayib Bukele the political power necessary to continue leading the country.
The results come from the elections of February 4. On February 5, Bukele claimed victory before the official announcement, asserting that the Nuevas Ideas party had obtained 58 seats instead of 54.
Recently, reports have emerged suggesting that Argentina might follow El Salvador’s example in adopting Bitcoin and other plans related to cryptocurrencies.
Not by chance, the Argentine securities regulatory authority, the National Securities Commission (CNV), met with the National Digital Resources Commission (CNAD) of El Salvador to discuss the adoption and regulation of cryptocurrencies in the two countries.
During the meeting on May 23, the president of the CNV Roberto Silva, the vice president of the CNV Patricia Boedo, and the president of the CNAD Juan Carlos Reyes discussed El Salvador’s experience with Bitcoin. 
The officials shared approaches and concepts on the use of cryptocurrencies in global economies, focusing in particular on the case of Bitcoin in El Salvador. 
Silva highlighted that El Salvador has not only emerged as a leader in the adoption of Bitcoin, but has also excelled in the broader cryptocurrency sector. 
He also emphasized the importance of the insights from the CNAD, which supervises and regulates the digital asset market in El Salvador, stating the following: 
“We want to strengthen ties with the Republic of El Salvador and, therefore, we will explore the possibility of signing collaboration agreements with them.”
The vice president of the CNV Boedo, who in March visited El Salvador to participate in meetings on market development, emphasized the crucial role of El Salvador’s experience in the cryptocurrency sector.
On the other hand, Reyes, an official from El Salvador, added:  
“Argentina is a pioneer in technology and the National Securities Commission wants to work with the industry efficiently to create appropriate regulation.”

Roaring Kitty Reveals $180 Million GME Bet: Meme Coins Surge


GameStop (GME) stock soared by 19% in overnight trading on Robinhood following a revelation by Keith Gill, famously known as “The Roaring Kitty.” 
On Reddit’s “DeepFuckingValue” account, Gill disclosed that he holds a notional value of over $180 million in GME shares and call options. This marked his first Reddit post since April 2021.
Crypto Traders Bet on GME Meme Coins

The post included a screenshot showing Gill’s investment of $115.7 million for 5 million GME shares and an additional $65.7 million in call options. This bold wager hinges on GameStop’s share price reaching at least $20 by June 21. 
Although his portfolio showed over $9.3 million gain from the shares, his options currently reflect a loss nearing $2.5 million.

Gill’s strategic disclosure also triggered a significant rally in the meme coin sector. Specifically, it impacted the Solana-based GME meme coin. This digital asset witnessed a 220% surge in value, pushing its market capitalization beyond $85 million within 24 hours. 
Market enthusiasts on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) speculate that GME will surge further. 

“If the rumors I’m hearing are true, this might be a one-off event in the history of Solana. We can be looking at a $2-3 billion market capitalization,” a crypto enthusiast, G-Chairman said.

Furthermore, the sentiment around meme investments has visibly intensified. Community members recall the trading restrictions during the 2021 GME short squeeze. Consequently, investors, wary of potential similar restrictions, are diversifying their bets to include meme coins like GME on the Solana blockchain.

Moreover, the hype has not been limited to GME-related assets. Other kitty-themed cryptocurrencies, including Kitty AI, have also seen their values double in response to the current market excitement.
This surge mirrors the broader impact of Gill’s influence, reminiscent of the meme stock and meme coin rallies spurred by Gill’s return on X in mid-May. Then, GameStop and AMC shares leaped over 70%.
Today, Gill posted a green UNO reverse card on X, adding an element of mystery. This move is typical of his cryptic communication style, which often precedes significant market movements.

Analyzing BNB's bullish pennant: Will it lead to a price surge? - AMBCrypto



Market sentiment around BNB has improved over the last few days.
Most indicators looked bullish on the coin.

After a week-long decline, BNB finally came back on track as the coin’s daily chart turned green. Notably, while that happened, the coin’s price was consolidating inside a bull pattern, which might allow the coin to reach new highs in the coming days. 
A bull pattern on BNB’s chart
According to CoinmarketCap, bears dominated the previous week as the coin’s price dropped to $587 on the 30th of May.
However, bulls stepped up in the last 24 hours and pushed the coin’s price up by over 1.4%. At the time of writing, the coin was trading at $613.41 with a market capitalization of over $90 billion, making it the fourth largest crypto. 
Thanks to the recent price uptick, the coin’s weighted sentiment has improved. This clearly shows that bullish sentiment around the coin has increased over the last few days. 
Its social volume also remained relatively high last week, reflecting BNB’s popularity in the crypto space. 
Source: Santiment
While all this happened, a bullish pennant pattern formed on the coin’s daily chart. The coin’s price entered the pattern in March and since then has been consolidating inside it. 
At press time, it was close to testing the upper limit of the pattern. A successful breakout could allow BNB to go above its March high over the coming weeks. 
Source: TradingView
Is a rally possible?
AMBCrypto then analyzed the coin’s on-chain metrics to check the odds of BNB successfully breaking above the bullish pennant pattern.
 As per our analysis of Santiment’s data, BNB’s open interest increased along with its price. Generally, a rise in the metric suggests that the chances of the on-going price trend continuing further are high. 
Nonetheless, BNB’s funding rate increased. As prices tend to move the other way than the funding rate, there is a possibility of BNB turning bearish soon. 
On top of that, BNB’s fear and greed index had a value of 61, meaning that the market was in a “greed” phase. Whenever the metric hits that level, it indicates a possible price correction.
Source: Santiment

Realistic or not, here’s BNB’s market cap in BTC terms   

We then took a look at the coin’s daily chart to better understand whether a bullish breakout was possible. According to our analysis, technical indicators looked pretty bullish on the coin. 
For example, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick from the neutral mark. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar trend, hinting at a continued price increase.

Mexico's Crypto Stance Unlikely to Change as Ruling Morena Party's Claudia Sheinbaum Elected President

The result signals the probable continuation of Mexico's crypto policy because Sheinbaum is from the ruling Morena party. Her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, could not run again under the constitution. Sheinbaum has aligned herself with Obrador's policies, though there was little to no mention of crypto in Mexico's biggest election to date.

Evolution of Web3 with AI

Artificial intelligence and Web3 have been two of the most revolutionary technologies of this era. AI has already become a significant part of the central building block of the world’s software. According to PwC estimates, AI will contribute a staggering $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, resulting in a 14% increase in global GDP. As we as a generation are on the cusp of a new technological era, the transition to Web3, AI, will play a significant role in shaping the digital world we will live in.
AI will revolutionize the Web3 world by adding remarkable automation, personalization, security, advanced data analytics, and improved smart contracts. Integrating AI with Web3 will redefine how Web3 works by focusing on what’s best for users.
Let’s delve into each topic one by one to learn more about the evolution of web3 with AI, starting with what is web3.

Are you new to the Web3 ecosystem? Here’s a comprehensive guide about what Web3 is and how it’s different from Web2 by Droomdroom.

What is Web3?

Web3, widely known as web3.0, is the third generation of the World Wide Web. It is a next-generation on the internet that envisions a decentralized, secure, and user-centric digital ecosystem that works on Blockchain technology. 
Web 3.0 is an innovation over Web 2.0. Here, data is controlled by users rather than one giant entity or company, resulting in more privacy and no censorship. Rewards earned are distributed equally among all the stakeholders or users in this case. 
The Main Pillars of Web 3.0
Decentralization 
Decentralization is a core aspect of web3. As Web2 uses HTTP to locate information, web3, being Blockchain-based, stores information at multiple locations across a network. It gives users more data control than big tech giants like Google and Meta. It enables users to sell their data according to their own will.
Connectivity
Information and content are more accessible in Web 3.0 as it’s stored at multiple locations and can be accessed by various devices worldwide.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Web3 will use technologies like NLP ( natural language processing) and semantic web to make their systems more advanced and receptive, like human intelligence.
Web3 will also utilize machine learning, which uses a large amount of data to train algorithms, improving accuracy and results.

Are you new to Web3? Here’s a Comprehensive guide to know all about Blockchain forks by Droomdoom.

What is AI?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by computer systems, capable of performing complex tasks that require reasoning and problem-solving. AI systems run by consuming large amounts of data that are later used to train machine learning algorithms. 
They then analyze the data to find patterns to model their decision-making or predict future states. This type of learning is called supervised learning. But some AI systems learn without supervision, for instance, by playing a video game repeatedly until the system knows every rule and way to win. This type of learning is categorized as unsupervised learning.
There are three cognitive skills on which AI programming is based – reasoning, learning, and self-correction.
Types of Artificial intelligence
Weak AI
Systems designed to perform particular tasks only. Personal assistants, Amazon’s Alexa, and video games are examples of weak AI.
Strong AI 
Systems that can perform tasks that require human intelligence and are more complex and complicated. For example, self-driving cars.
Ways Evolution of Web3 with AI is Made Possible
Automation
AI’s ultra capability to learn and automate tasks can help Web3 users escape tedious and time-consuming tasks. From minting new NFTs to managing digital wallets, AI can seamlessly shoulder these responsibilities and liberate users to focus on more creative tasks.
Personalization
AI can significantly personalize Web3 users’ journeys and make their experiences more customized and engaging by analyzing user data like browsing history and using machine learning algorithms like collaborative and content-based filtering. AI algorithms can generate personalized recommendations and services that align with users’ needs and interests.

Learn 6 helpful strategies to diversify your crypto portfolio using altcoins, maximizing your investment potential, with this comprehensive article.

For example, AI can be used in advertising to make targeted marketing campaigns by analyzing user data to make it appealing and most relatable to individual users, resulting in better advertising and conversion rates.
Data Analysis and Insights 
AI-driven analysis can play a crucial role in developing the Web3 ecosystem. The key aspect of AI analysis is that it can process large amounts of vast, complex, and diverse datasets generated by decentralized platforms, users, transactions, and execution of smart contracts. AI can find uncovered patterns and insights that can contribute highly to the growth and development of the Web3 ecosystem.
Security
AI can play a vital role in enhancing security and trust within the Web3 ecosystem by identifying potential risks, vulnerabilities, threats, or hacks. By proactive detection of any future cyber threats or dangers, AI can help Web3 maintain a secure and safe environment by keeping data private through advanced encryption and anonymization.
Machine learning algorithms can be trained on large data sets to identify future cyber threats, such as phishing attacks or unauthorized access to an account. 
AI can be used for unique protection by providing personalized authentication to each user by analyzing their behavioral patterns or user-specific characteristics like facial features. This will help web3 platforms to become more robust and less vulnerable to fraud and impersonation.
Smart Contracts 
AI implementation can significantly revolutionize the functionality of smart contracts in Web3 by integrating advanced decision-making capabilities and enabling dynamic transactions on any Web3 platform. 
Smart contracts are, like any contract, executed an agreement with terms and conditions written into a code. It does not need any broker or intermediaries to execute the agreement, thus reducing the probability of manipulation and ensuring trust and transparency.

Are you new to the crypto world? Here’s a comprehensive guide on the role of smart contracts in Decentralized Finance. 

What Factors Contribute to WEB3 Adopting ML Technologies From a Top-Doen Approach?
Adopting machine learning (ML) technologies follows a top-down approach mainly due to its complex infrastructure, which needs experts to implement ML technologies into the Web3 ecosystem.
The top-down approach is adopted in Web3 for ML technology for several reasons: 
Technical Complexity
Integration of ML technology in Web3 space requires a deep understanding of both Decentralization Infratech and ML algorithms. Seamless integration of ML technologies in decentralized infrastructure demands expertise as it’s very intricate.
Security and Privacy
Providing security and privacy is one of the primary goals of Web 3.0. Integrating ML technology through a top-down approach allows experts to design and implement ML solutions that align with the core principles of Web3, ensuring that these goals are not compromised.
Scalability and Performance 
Implementing ML technologies requires addressing significant challenges with Web3, including scalability and performance. The top-down approach helps ensure that ML solutions designed are intended to make the Web3 ecosystem more efficient and scalable.
Standardization and Interoperability
For effective adoption of ML technologies across Web3 platforms, standardization and interoperability must be achieved. Top-down adoption allows a more unified approach and promotes collaboration among stakeholders. 
Key Challenges Faced by AI: Web 3.0 as a Solution
With large language models like ChatGPT and Midjourney, we have seen a drastic change in digital content creation and businesses.
While these technologies offer many advantages, such as high-quality content, increased productivity, and efficiency, they also come with many new challenges.
Here, we have uncovered some critical challenges in generated content and potential threats that must be addressed.
Fake Spread of News 
One of the significant problems of AI-generated content is the propagation of fake content. With language models like ChatGPT and Midjourney, producing realistic news articles and pictures is easy, making it more challenging to differentiate from human-written content. Keeping track is more complex as the line between reality and fiction becomes blurred. It can result in a potential collapse in the perception of reality.
Solution
Various tools have been developed to check the content’s origin, with metadata tracking and reverse image searches. Many organizations like factcheck.org are working to burst fake news stories and maintain a trustworthy ecosystem. Blockchain can play a vital role in tracking the authenticity of the content by storing their metadata, the author’s identity with a  timestamp of publication, on a decentralized and tamper-proof ledger where readers can verify the origin of information.
Trust Collapse
The rapid increase in AI-generated content can result in the trust collapse of the public as it becomes harder to look into the authenticity of the content. Trust collapse can raise implications for journalism and businesses that highly run on public trust, only undermining the credibility of the content produced. This makes establishing accountability for any wrongful facts or inaccuracies presented in the range harder. As a result, the public becomes skeptical about any content they come across. 
Solution
Transparency with the origin of the content, such as watermarking or labeling the source, can help. Blockchain can play an important role here as any piece of content stored on Blockchain is verified. by validators, which makes every piece of information stored there unique with the help of hash value allotted to every individual piece of information, which is interlinked with previous information stored, hence making a chain.
Exploitation of Law
AI-generated content can be used to exploit loopholes in laws and regulations. For example, AI can create convincing, deep, fake videos and audio, altering court proceedings and results. 
Solution
Lawmakers should be aware of AI advancements and develop policies and regulations restricting cause mishaps. Collaborative work between AI researchers and Lawmakers will ensure that.
Blackmails and Threats 
AI-generated blackmail can take many forms:  

Deepfakes: AI can generate very realistic videos, images, and audio, which can be used to threaten anyone and put them in compromising situations with the threat of public exposure.
AI-generated threats: AI’s capability of producing personalized content can raise considerable dangers of creating convincing and personalized blackmail, playing on their fears and vulnerabilities. 
Fabricated documents: AI-generated content can be presented as authentic documents, which become more complex to differentiate from the original one. This can result in coercing victims to pay huge ransoms and comply with the blackmailer’s demands.

Solutions
Machine learning algorithms can be trained to identify patterns and commonalities of AI-generated threats and signs of manipulation. To combat AI-generated threats, collaborative work of lawmakers and cybersecurity professionals to detect and restrict any mishaps.
A decentralized reputation system can help users identify trustworthy content and counterparts and promote transparency.

Ethereum exodus: $3 billion ETH leaves crypto exchanges after SEC greenlights spot ETFs


    In just over a week since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), cryptocurrency exchanges have seen substantial ETH outflow, demonstrating the impact of regulatory decisions on market dynamics.



As it happens, since the securities watchdog’s approval of Ethereum spot ETFs on May 23, 2024, approximately 777,000 ETH – valued at around $3 billion – has left crypto exchanges, according to the chart data and observations shared by renowned crypto trading expert Ali Martinez in an X post on June 2.

Indeed, the Glassnode chart shared by the analyst showcases the massive changes in the total balance of Ethereum on all crypto exchanges, which has witnessed a significant drop in the days following the approval to the areas of around 12.5 million ETH, coinciding with a price increase.







Ethereum price analysis



At press time, the second-largest asset in the crypto sector by market capitalization was trading at the price of $3,821.12, suggesting an increase of 0.75% in the last 24 hours, declining 2.43% across the previous seven days, while advancing 22.94% on its monthly chart.

More recently, this crypto asset has demonstrated significant strength against the market representative and flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, Bitcoin (BTC), reclaiming a key trendline that has been immensely important for more than seven years, as Finbold reported on June 1.



Ethereum ETF effect



As a reminder, the price of Ethereum started to increase on May 20, not long after Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that he and his colleague James Seyffart believed that the chances for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF were 75%, as opposed to the earlier 25%.







In the same period, Martinez also noted that Ethereum whales had bought 110,000 ETH, worth about $341 million at the time, during the 24 hours leading up to his X post on May 20, indicating a major increase in interest from the market’s largest holders in the expectation of the spot ETF approval.



All things considered, the massive withdrawal of Ethereum from exchanges suggests a growing preference among crypto traders and investors to secure their holdings in anticipation of further price growth and reduced selling pressure on exchanges, which is typically a bullish sign.

Crypto Crime Busters: China, UAE Vow to Combat Telecom Fraud and Online Gambling


								In a move signaling a global shift, China and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have forged a strategic alliance to combat cybercrime involving cryptocurrency.

Joint Effort Against Crypto Crime
This partnership comes amidst a surge in crypto fraud activity in Hong Kong, highlighting the growing need for international cooperation in the Wild West of digital finance.
The pact, outlined in a joint statement following UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s visit to China, targets specific areas like telecom fraud and online gambling.
This collaborative effort transcends crypto-crime, with both nations vowing to crack down on money laundering, human trafficking, and other illicit activities that could exploit digital assets.
While the statement doesn’t detail specific cryptocurrency regulations, it suggests a coordinated approach to prevent the misuse of these technologies. This could pave the way for a global framework for crypto governance.
But the alliance isn’t solely focused on security concerns. The document emphasizes the potential of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to revolutionize cross-border trade and investment. Both countries plan to deepen their cooperation on CBDC development, building upon a signed Memorandum of Understanding.
Bitcoin is now trading at $68,943. Chart: TradingView
UAE Pioneers Cross-Border CBDC
The UAE’s pioneering role in completing the first-ever cross-border CBDC transaction using the mBridge platform hasn’t gone unnoticed. This landmark 50 million dirham transfer signifies a potential game-changer, offering an alternative to the dominant Swift payment system. Experts believe this could lead to a future with fragmented regional payment networks.
This development aligns with ongoing projects by Hong Kong’s Monetary Authority (HKMA). Their mBridge and e-HKD initiatives are testaments to the growing global interest in CBDCs.
The mBridge project, expected to launch by mid-2024, could offer a faster, cheaper alternative for cross-border transactions, potentially impacting traditional financial institutions.
The China-UAE alliance marks a significant step towards a more regulated and secure cryptocurrency landscape. Their collaboration on CBDCs suggests a future where digital currencies play a central role in international finance.

As the digital asset ecosystem evolves, this partnership could model a future where innovation and security coexist.

$3 Billion ETH Withdrawn After Spot Ethereum ETF Approval


Significant movement has occurred in the crypto market since the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) preliminary approval for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
A recent analysis by CryptoQuant highlights that unidentified entities have withdrawn over 800,000 Ethereum (ETH) from crypto exchanges, valued at approximately $3 billion.
Surge in Ethereum Withdrawals Signals Investor Optimism

Burak Kesmeci, an analyst at CryptoQuant, assumes that these transactions originated from either individual crypto whales or institutional investors. He speculated that the individual whales anticipate an increase in the ETH price following the approval of a spot ETF. Meanwhile, institutional investors are likely getting ready for the launch of these ETFs.

“These institutions may want to meet the demand of their investors with the launch of the spot Ethereum ETF,” Kesmeci wrote.

Despite the anonymity surrounding these transactions, both are drawn to the market behavior observed after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.
The migration of such a large volume of ETH from exchanges typically indicates a preference for holding assets in self-custodial platforms. This situation leads to tighter supply conditions on crypto exchanges.
Therefore, Kesmeci projected that the current withdrawals would positively influence Ethereum’s price in the medium term. The reduction in exchange-held ETH often hints at a future supply squeeze, potentially driving prices higher as availability diminishes.

Indeed, the preliminary approval for spot Ethereum ETFs has infused renewed optimism in the market and broader crypto industry. BeInCrypto previously reported that some protocols in the Ethereum ecosystem, like Aave and Uniswap, experienced a total value locked increase (TVL) during the period.
Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have weighed in. They predict that the Ethereum ETFs could capture 10% to 20% of the flow seen by their Bitcoin counterparts. According to SoSo Value data, spot Bitcoin ETFs have garnered a total net inflow of $13.6 billion since their inception.

Seyffart and Balchunas expect final approval for the Ethereum ETFs by July, suggesting that the market could see even more significant movements in the coming months.

'Rigged Casino with Dumb People': Dogecoin Creator Slams Crypto


Nate Alex, a popular NFT artist and collector, recently expressed a critical opinion on the current state of the crypto market. He compared it to a rigged casino, suggesting that most of the focus is on onboarding retail investors so insiders can profit by selling "scamcoins."This opinion resonated widely and caught the attention of Billy Markus, one of the creators of Dogecoin, who goes by the pseudonym Shibetoshi Nakamoto. Markus echoed this sentiment, describing the crypto market as a place where many people pretend to be smarter than they are.Interestingly, despite his harsh criticism, Nate Alex remains heavily invested in the cryptocurrency market, in his own words. He stated that nearly all of his liquid capital is tied up in crypto and believes the market trend will continue to rise, at least for the remainder of the year.  Is it really a rigged casino?The latest cryptocurrency market cycle has seen a shift toward less serious ventures, with new meme cryptocurrencies like PEPE, BONK and WIF gaining significant attention last year, laying the foundation for a major meme cryptocurrency mania, which we can observe today. As a result, Solana has exploded with thousands of new meme cryptocurrencies of varying quality, which eventually morphed into celebrity tokens that are just as often a means of taking money from less selective crypto enthusiasts.Against this backdrop, more fundamental and older projects are getting less attention, and their prices, unlike meme cryptocurrencies and especially in this cycle, have not risen. DOGE to USD by CoinMarketCapInterestingly, even DOGE, as the largest and most famous meme cryptocurrency, has not experienced a special surge of interest and consequent growth in volume and price, as all attention has shifted from it to smaller meme coins.

Bitcoin's $150,000 Potential: Peter Brandt's Bull Market Cycle Analysis | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent report, renowned trader and analyst Peter Brandt shed light on the fascinating symmetry of Bitcoin’s bull market cycles, particularly in relation to Bitcoin’s “Halving” events.



Peter Brandt is a highly experienced trader with a deep background in the commodities trading sector. Initially gaining recognition for his work with commodities, Brandt has expanded his reputation over the years to include forex and cryptocurrency trading. His expertise is particularly evident in his ability to analyze market patterns and trends, insights he frequently shares through social media and various trading publications.



Brandt is especially renowned for his use of classical charting principles in trading, a methodology he has honed over decades. He has authored a book detailing these principles, offering readers a glimpse into his strategies and thought processes. His forecasts and analyses, especially regarding major market movements in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, have garnered him a significant following among traders who value his experienced perspective on market dynamics. In addition to trading, Brandt contributes to the trading community by providing mentorship and educational resources, helping others navigate the complexities of financial markets.



The Bitcoin Halving is a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency’s journey, occurring approximately every four years. During these events, the mining rewards for Bitcoin are cut in half, effectively reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation. Interestingly, Brandt has observed that these Halving dates have coincided with the halfway points of Bitcoin’s bull market cycles.



Brandt’s analysis reveals a striking pattern: the number of weeks from the start of each bull market cycle (marked by a low following a 75% or greater decline) to the Halving date is nearly equal to the number of weeks from the Halving date to the subsequent bull market peak. He says this symmetry has been consistent throughout Bitcoin’s history, suggesting that the cryptocurrency’s price action is influenced by these key events.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

If this pattern continues, Brandt predicts that the next bull market cycle high could occur in late August or early September 2025. This projection is based on the observed symmetry and the timing of the previous Halving events.



But how high could Bitcoin potentially reach during this upcoming bull run? While no method of analysis is infallible, Brandt notes that the peaks of past bull markets align closely with an inverted parabolic curve. If this trend persists, he suggests that the high of the current bull market cycle could fall within the range of $130,000 to $150,000.



However, Brandt is cautious not to be overly dogmatic about his predictions. As a seasoned trader, he acknowledges that there is always a degree of uncertainty in the markets. While his preferred analysis points towards a bullish outcome, he also assigns a 25% probability to the possibility that Bitcoin’s price has already topped for this cycle.



In an alternative scenario, outlined in a separate analysis, Brandt explores the concept of “Exponential Decay.” This theory suggests that if Bitcoin fails to make a decisive new all-time high and instead falls below the $55,000 mark, the probability of a bearish trend would increase.

Important Ripple v. SEC Lawsuit Update, Bitcoin (BTC) Price Swings, and More: Bits Recap June 3


																TL;DR

Bitcoin’s price fluctuated between $67,000 and $70K, settling at the upper mark. It’s up 8% monthly but below its all-time high, with potential for a substantial rally.
Ripple’s current trial stage against the SEC over sealing financial documents continues after a new filing from the company.
Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 solution, surpassed five million blocks and 417 million transactions, aiming to foster the development of the meme coin.


BTC’s Ups and Downs
The leading cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization witnessed mild volatility in the past few days, hovering from $67,000 to around $69,100. It consolidated around $67,700 over the weekend before climbing to its current level of over $69K (per CoinGecko’s data).
BTC is up 8% monthly but is still well below the all-time high of over $73,500 registered in mid-March. Multiple analysts believe the asset is gearing up for another substantial rally, naming some important factors as catalysts.
The X user Quinten claimed that the price of the asset may start a bull run after the US presidential elections (scheduled for November this year). He based his forecast on BTC’s historical ascents following previous campaigns. 
KALEO – a crypto analyst with over 600,000 followers on X – was bullish, too, envisioning a price jump above the $100,000 milestone sometime this summer.




Ripple v. SEC
The legal battle between the entities escalated last week after Ripple filed a reply letter in further support of its motion to seal data related to the regulator’s motion for judgment and remedies. The company sought to seal and redact some evidence and financial documents a few months ago, but the SEC opposed the move. 
“The Court should deny Ripple’s request to conceal financial and securities sales information because that information constitutes “judicial documents” as it is at the heart of the arguments the parties have presented in support of their remedies motion and could, therefore, tend to influence the Court’s remedies decision,” the agency stated in May.
The watchdog insisted that such information could give more clarity about Ripple’s XRP sales from years ago and contribute to the outcome of the legal process. According to the firm, though, historical contracts have “no continuing relevance” because it has enforced certain amendments on its XRP sales procedures.
The case’s potential resolution might significantly impact the price of Ripple’s native token. Those willing to learn why, feel free to check our dedicated video below:

Shiba Inu Advancements
The popular meme coin also made the headlines as of late, with its layer-2 scaling solution – Shibarium – blasting through another huge milestone. As CryptoPotato reported, the total blocks processed on the network exceeded the five million mark.
The number of total transactions on Shibarium currently stands at over 417 million, while wallet addresses surpassed 1.8 million.
The blockchain solution aims to foster the development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem by improving speed, lowering transaction fees, and boosting scalability. Last month, it underwent two upgrades to allow compatibility with popular self-custody wallets and enhance the overall user experience.

Landwolf (WOLF) Joins ProBit Global, Reinventing Meme Coin Standards - Coin Edition


							

Landwolf (WOLF) lists on ProBit Global, emphasizing trust and community.



WOLF token opposes hidden transaction taxes, ensuring fairness for users.



Landwolf burns its initial liquidity pool, giving control to the community and preventing rug pulls.




The ProBit Global exchange has welcomed Landwolf (WOLF), a meme coin with a refreshing focus on trust, transparency, and community building. In particular, WOLF has become one of the newest meme tokens to be listed on ProBit Global. 



Landwolf stands out by prioritizing genuine connections and fostering a supportive environment. Their mascot, Wolf, embodies loyalty and strength, reflecting their core value of “real friends stick together.”  Their mantra is supported by characters like Boy’s Club friends Pepe and Andy, underscoring their commitment to creating a supportive community.



One of Landwolf’s key differentiators is its approach to transactions. The project has opposed hidden taxes on swaps, ensuring that every transaction is transparent and equitable for its users. 



This commitment extends to managing their liquidity pool. Specifically, Landwolf burns the initial liquidity pool tokens and relinquishes control over the community. This assures its community that they can trade and hold WOLF tokens without the threat of liquidity being unexpectedly withdrawn.









Furthermore, Landwolf’s dedication to its community is evident in its decision to avoid pre-allocating WOLF tokens to developers, team members, or marketing campaigns. This approach seeks to foster a free market environment to allow the community to engage with the token on an equal footing and free from concerns about tokenomics or uneven distribution.



Ultimately, the Landwolf team considers the introduction of WOLF on ProBit Global a significant moment for the meme coin niche. Landwolf seeks to redefine what it means to be a meme coin with its commitment to fostering trust, ensuring transparency, and nurturing a supportive community.



Crypto enthusiasts are invited to explore the Landwolf (WOLF) listing on ProBit Global, participate in the trading competition, and remain in the loop for the upcoming WOLF Megadrop to win a share of 520,000,000 WOLF tokens on ProBit Global.

XRP Ledger Turns 12 Years Old


XRP, one of the biggest cryptocurrencies, has celebrated its 12th birthday on June 2. On that day in 2012, Ripple Labs co-founder Arthur Britto submitted the lines code that had created 100 billion XRP tokens.It is worth noting that the earliest days of the XRP Ledger have been lost forever due to a critical bug. Hence, the XRP Ledger can be traced back only to December 2012 instead of its actual birthday. "We were still madly squashing bugs as these were early days. We reset the Ledger seq multiple times (for binary format changes) and transaction history was erased," the Ripple CTO said back in December 2019.  Ripple CTO David Schwartz was working with Ripple co-founders Arthur Britto and Jed McCaleb starting in late 2011. Schwartz's first commit was submitted back in November 2011. A major upgrade Earlier this year, the XRP Ledger got a major update with the launch of the automated market maker (AMM) feature. As reported by U.Today, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that he was "particularly excited" about the new feature.   The total XRP locked has now surpassed five million, according to a recent update. Meanwhile, the number of active liquidity pools is now in excess of 500. "With 500 pairs we also reached 25% of Uniswap V3 total pairs. Optimistic for volume and swaps to catch up, the AMM/DEX is in the center of all DeFi," Vet, operator of the XRP Ledger dUNL, said on the X social media platform.

Spider-Verse Producer Promises to Never Use Generative AI in Franchise - Decrypt

Christopher Miller, the co-writer and producer of Sony’s beloved “Spider-Verse” series, has promised the franchise will never use generative AI.“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” was originally released in 2018 and won the Oscar for Best Animated Film. The sequel, 2023’s “Across the Spider-Verse,” remains one of the best-reviewed animated movies of all time. Both used a variety of animation styles with the franchise regularly praised for evolving what an animated film could be. The final chapter in the trilogy, “Beyond the Spider-Verse”, is currently in the works.However co-writer and producer Christopher Miller has been forced to deny the film will be using generative AI following comments from CEO of Sony Picture Entertainment Tony Vinciquerra.Speaking at an investors conference last week, Vinciquerra said the company was “very focused” on AI and wanted to use the tech to produce films and TV shows “more efficiently”. Vinciquerra’s comments follow on from DreamWorks founder Jeffrey Katzenberg 2023 prediction that AI will cut the cost of animated movies by as much as 90 per cent.Some fans are worried about what the use of Generative AI will mean for their favourite movies, with one taking to X to write: “Dear Sony Animation. Keep generative AI away from Spider-Man: Beyond The Spider-Verse.”“AI robs people of their jobs & produces nothing but slop. We don’t want that anywhere near this film or any film for that matter. Please keep it away from the filmmaking process,” they added, tagging Miller and fellow “Spider-Verse” co-writer and producer Phil Lord.“There is no generative AI in Beyond the Spider-Verse and there never will be,” replied Miller. “One of the main goals of the films is to create new visual styles that have never been seen in a studio CG film, not steal the generic plagiarized average of other artists’ work.”“When we say that we want to feel and see the hand of the artist in every frame, We mean it,” added visual effects supervisor Michael Lasker while production designer Patrick O’Keefe said the studio preferred working with artists. “My favourite part of making these films is the collaboration between humans,” he added.However, other fans are still worried about the crunch many animators and VFX artists may face to get the movie completed with over 100 animators reportedly quitting the production of “Into the Spider-Verse” due to unsustainable working conditions.“Beyond the Spider-Verse” had been due to be released this year, but was removed from Sony’s slate of upcoming releases following the writer’s strike. A new release date has yet to be announced.Over the weekend, AI Film Academy’s inaugural AIFA Awards took place to recognise the “extraordinary diversity of stories and the radically new visual language of AI.”AI Film Academy co-founder Leo Crane told Decrypt: “We're trying to prove this idea that the emerging technology opens up the field on a global scale.”Edited by Stacy Elliott.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Cardano Tech Lead Packs The Bitcoin Chain Into One Block


								The Technical Director at the Cardano Foundation, Matthias Benkort (also known as @KtorZ), has successfully encapsulated the entire Bitcoin blockchain within a single block on the Cardano blockchain. This announcement, made via X (formerly Twitter), has sent ripples through the blockchain community, highlighting the potential for advanced data management and interoperability between blockchains.
A Breakthrough For Cardano And Blockchain Technology
Benkort’s revelation came with the release of a new open-source library on GitHub, titled “Merkle Patricia Forestry.” The library introduces a set of both on-chain and off-chain tools designed to work with Merkle Patricia Tries on Cardano. As described in the release documentation, a Merkle Patricia Trie is “a persistent & authenticated data structure to map between arbitrary keys and values.” Essentially, it functions as a highly efficient and secure hashmap.
The documentation elaborates on the structure, stating, “Items are represented in a space-optimized trie (a.k.a prefix tree) of radix 16. The hash digest of their keys provides the path to values in the trie.” This approach offers numerous use cases, such as maintaining large on-chain registries (e.g., domains), or providing vast oracled datasets of intrinsic data (e.g., a map of delegators/delegatees) or extrinsic data (e.g., GitHub data related to an ecosystem of projects). It is particularly well-suited for long-running datasets that grow at a slow rate, such as a Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain.

Key features of the Merkle Patricia Forestry library include rapid membership, insertion, and deletion of any key/value item in a large store, facilitated by a root hash digest (32 bytes) and a succinct proof (<1KB). The library incorporates several optimizations inspired by Ethereum’s Modified Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT), but introduces a novel approach for organizing nodes as tiny Sparse Merkle Trees. This innovation results in much smaller proof sizes and is the basis for the library’s name: Merkle Patricia Forestry.
Benkort explained the performance trade-offs, noting that the optimization sacrifices some memory and CPU execution units to achieve smaller proof sizes. Despite this, the library strikes a good balance between proof size, memory usage, and CPU efficiency, as detailed in the performance tables included in the documentation. These tables summarize the proof size, memory units, and CPU units required for various trie sizes, highlighting the efficiency of the library in different scenarios.
Detailed Explanation And Demonstration
In a series of detailed posts on X, Cardano Foundation’s Benkort provided further insights into the implementation and capabilities of the library. He explained that the library consists of two parts: one implemented in Aiken for specific utilities to smart contracts, and another in Node.js for off-chain operations. This comprehensive implementation of modified Merkle Patricia Tries, with a unique twist, is what Benkort calls ‘Merkle Patricia Forestry.’
“Fundamentally, this is an authenticated data structure for mapping arbitrary keys to arbitrary values,” Benkort stated. “Yet, it is done in such a way that it is possible to perform some operations from only a small hash and a succinct proof, without the need to carry the entire data structure.”
For those familiar with blockchain technology, Merkle Trees are a similar, albeit simpler structure, primarily used for representing lists of items and verifying their membership using a root hash. However, Merkle Patricia Tries (MPTs) extend this functionality, allowing not only membership verification but also the insertion and deletion of key/value pairs. Ethereum employs MPTs for its blockchain state and transaction storage, enabling light clients to query balances without storing the entire blockchain.

One significant issue with traditional MPTs is the large size of proofs, which can span multiple kilobytes for extensive data stores. This isn’t as problematic for off-chain operations, but on-chain, every byte is precious. Benkort’s implementation addresses this by using tiny Sparse Merkle Trees of 16 items at each level, effectively creating trees within tries. This structure drastically reduces the size of proofs, trading off some computational steps for Cardano’s efficiency gains.
Benkort demonstrated this capability through a recent transaction that spent a UTxO containing the root hash of a Merkle Patricia Forestry representing the entire Bitcoin block header hashes, compressed into just 32 bytes. The transaction proved the ability to continue the chain by inserting a new block into the trie, maintaining an authenticated chain of over 850,000 blocks with minimal data overhead.
“The transaction I just linked is doing something quite unexpected,” Benkort explained. “It spends a UTxO that contains the root hash of a Merkle Patricia Forestry representing the entire Bitcoin block header hashes, mapped to their transactions. That’s about 850,000 blocks, compressed in 32 bytes.”
To spend this UTxO, a proof must be provided on-chain to show the continuation of the chain by inserting a new block in the trie. The updated root hash stored on-chain must represent the previous chain plus one block. The entire validator for this operation fits into just 26 lines of Cardano’s Aiken.
Future Implications And Use Cases
Benkort highlighted the potential applications of this technology, ranging from trustless bridges to arbitrarily large key/value stores managed fully on-chain. “Imagine the realm of possibilities with such large datasets,” he suggested. “A domains registry? A feed of financial market data? GitHub stats? I do see a world where institutions or committees publish large datasets in the form of a simple root hash on-chain, effectively serving as oracles for a variety of smart contracts down the line.”
Benkort concluded by reflecting on the journey of this project, which began as a side project at the end of last year. “It feels good to finally release this,” he said. “It was originally something I started at the end of last year, a bit as a side project. Given the many conversations about this lately, I thought I’d resurrect and properly package that code. Open sourcing for the win.”
At press time, Cardano (ADA) traded at $0.455.

Notcoin surpasses Solana, BNB in volume: NOT to $0.1 now? - AMBCrypto



Notcoin’s price rallied, volume hits $4.54 billion, only behind BTC, ETH, and USDT.
The price could drop to $0.015 as indicators showed that the token was overbought.

The 24-hour volume of Notcoin [NOT], fueled by the tremendous price increase, was more than that of Solana [SOL] and BNB. As of this writing, NOT’s volume was $.4.54 billion, according to Santiment.
The price, on the other hand, was $0.021. This value was at a 287% hike in the last seven days. However, the price mentioned was a decline as Notcoin had initially hit $0.028 on the 2nd of June.
During the same period, BNB’s volume was $1.75 billion while Solana recorded $1.72 billion in trading volume. The metric is an indicator of interest. Therefore, the surge meant a lot of capital was deployed in the token’s favor.
Source: Santiment
Back-to-back jumps
For those unfamiliar, Notcoin launched about a month ago. And previously, AMBCrypto had reported how its launch was marred by selling pressure.
However, another article explained what led to the price surge and the jump into the top 100 per market cap. In the mentioned piece, we had predicted that NOT would hit $0.01.
Interestingly, it did not take long for the project to do that. Moreso, Notcoin is now part of the top 60 in terms of market cap, rising above Bonk [BONK].
Apart from that, the Open Interest (OI) around the token surged over the weekend. According to Coinglass, Notcoin’s OI was as high as $273.02 million.
Source: Coinglass
When the OI decreases, it means that money is exiting the market as more contracts get closed. However, an increase in the metric is a sign of the presence of new liquidity.
For the price, the rising OI was one of the reasons NOT was able to sustain its uptrend. This is because increasing Open Interest can serve as a strength for the direction a token is moving.
However, traders, as well as NOT holders might need to be careful.
NOT becomes overbought, hurts traders’ positions
For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour timeframe was 72.60. The RSI measures momentum.  A reading below 30 indicates that an asset is oversold.
But a reading over 70 indicates that the cryptocurrency is overbought, and that was the situation with Notcoin. Considering this position, NOT’s price could fall.
Source: Santiment
If the potential decline continues, the price of NOT could drop to $0.015. However, a resurgence in buying pressure could push the price back in the upward direction.
Beyond that, the Weighted Sentiment was a lot higher than normal, suggesting that many market participants were bullish on NOT. However, this metric seemed to have reached an extreme level. As such, it could validate the bearish prediction above.
Meanwhile, interesting things were happening with Notcoin in the derivatives market.
Source: Coinglass

Realistic or not, here’s NOT’s market cap in SOL terms

According to Coinglass, NOT was only behind Bitcoin [BTC] in terms of 24-hour liquidation.
For that period, shorts were the most affected by the $23.48 million liquidation. However, that has changed within the last hour as the decline in NOT’s price has forced longs to record a large part of the $1.75 million wipeout.

These Altcoins Plunge by Double Digits Following Delistings From Binance: Details


																TL;DR

Binance will halt trading services for some cryptocurrencies. The announcement was followed by significant price drops for the involved assets.
It recently introduced new trading pairs like BTC/MXN and removed some older ones, continuing to adjust its offerings to enhance user experience and respond to latest market trends.


The Affected Cryptocurrencies
Binance will terminate trading on all spot and margin pairs for the following tokens: OmiseGO (OMG), Waves (WAVES), Wrapped NXM (WNXM), and NEM (XEM). Withdrawals of these assets from the platform will not be supported after September 17, while the delisted coins may be converted into stablecoins on behalf of users after September 18.
“Binance Simple Earn will delist the tokens mentioned above after 2024-06-13 03:00 (UTC). Users may choose to redeem their Flexible and Locked Products positions beforehand. Otherwise, these Flexible and Locked Products positions will be automatically redeemed at the above-mentioned time and subsequently transferred to users’ Spot Wallets, together with any accrued rewards, from 2024-06-13 03:00 (UTC). 
Binance Auto-Invest will cease trading services with the tokens after June 7, while Binance Loans and VIP Loan will close the offering four days later.
The company did not provide an exact reason behind its move, reminding it periodically reviews each listed cryptocurrency to ensure it meets “a high level of standard and industry requirements.” Some of the important factors considered by Binance include the team’s commitment, level and quality of development activity, trading volume, liquidity, and more.
Some of the affected digital assets, such as OMG and WAVES, witnessed a double-digit price drop following the announcement. XEM was the worst affected, plummeting by over 30% on a 24-hour scale. Currently, it trades at a seven-month low of approximately $0.025 (per CoinGecko’s data).





XEM Price, Source: CoinGecko
Delisting cryptocurrencies from a major trading venue like Binance can significantly impact their price performance. The process may cause a negative perception of the tokens’ credibility and future potential, reputational damage, and other setbacks.
A similar price decline of an affected token occurred in February this year when the exchange halted trading services with Monero (XMR) and three other altcoins. The popular privacy coin saw its valuation drop by over 20% shortly after the announcement. 
Other Recent Binance Updates
The company enforced several amendments on its platform in the past few days, including the introduction of new trading pairs.
Last week, it added BTC/MXN, XRP/MXN, ENS/USDC, and LDO/USDC on Binance Spot. Two of the pairs touch upon the Mexican peso (MXN) – the national currency of the Latin American country. Earlier this year, the exchange launched a direct pair between USDT and MXN.
On the other hand, Binance removed some previously listed pairs, such as CAKE/TUSD, DYDX/BNB, and LAZIO/BTC.

Ethereum's Ether Token Surges 67% in 2024, Bullish Patterns Suggest Continued Rise



                    

Ethereum‘s native token, Ether, has seen a significant increase of approximately 67% in 2024 and might continue to surge in June according to various on-chain, fundamental, and technical indicators. 



As of June 1, Ether was observed in the breakout stage of a falling wedge pattern, a bullish reversal setup known for its two converging descending trendlines. 




The typical resolution of this pattern occurs when the price surpasses the upper trendline, potentially increasing by the height of the wedge.



On May 20, the price of ETH surged above the upper line of the wedge, accompanied by higher trading volumes, indicating a potential target of about $4,255 by the end of June—an increase of 12.65% from its current price.



Additionally, Ether seems to be forming a bull flag pattern, featuring parallel downward-sloping lines. This pattern suggests a price breakout above the upper trendline, possibly reaching $6,000 by the end of June or early July.




The possibility of Ether reaching $4,000 is further supported by increased holdings among its largest investors. 



On-chain data from Santiment shows a 0.5% increase in Ether holdings by accounts possessing between 10 million and 100 million ETH since May 20. 



This period coincides with speculation about the SEC reevaluating its stance on Ether ETFs.



READ MORE: Franklin Templeton Fires First Shot in Ether ETF Fee War with 0.19% Sponsor Fee Disclosure




Following the SEC’s approval of spot Ether ETFs on May 23, the ETH/USD price experienced a 19.25% surge. 



In contrast, holders of 1 million to 10 million ETH decreased their positions, indicating profit-taking. 



Moreover, the overall Ether reserves on crypto exchanges have also diminished, signifying a strong hodling sentiment among investors, which could drive prices further up in June.



Analyst views on Ether are optimistic, particularly after BlackRock updated its SEC filing for the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). 



Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented on May 29, “This is a good sign. 



“We’ll probably see the rest roll in soon.” 



Balchunas had earlier suggested that Ether ETFs might capture 10-15% of the initial inflows seen by Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted $13.85 billion since their inception in January.



The successful introduction of Ether ETFs and the expected capital inflows indicate a rising demand for ETH, potentially pushing its price beyond $4,000 in the coming month.

CEO Jensen Huang has pledged to release new AI chip technology on a yearly basis, accelerating the company’s previous two-year timeline.



The Rubin platform will feature new GPUs and a central processor called “Vera,” showcasing Nvidia’s focus on innovation in AI and accelerated computing. With competitors like AMD, Intel, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon vying for market share, Nvidia aims to maintain its dominant position through its hardware and software integration.



The company’s CUDA platform, often compared to Apple’s iOS for its dominance and influence, gives Nvidia an impenetrable advantage over its rivals.





Projected $10 Trillion Valuation by 2030



As of June 2, 2024, Nvidia’s market capitalization stands at approximately $2.7 trillion. However, Beth Kindig, lead tech analyst at the I/O Fund, predicts that the company’s market cap will surge another 270% to reach $10 trillion by 2030.



This projection is driven by the high demand for Nvidia’s chips in data centers and the expected growth in the automotive sector. CEO Jensen Huang has described the current industry phase as the start of the next industrial revolution, highlighting the crucial role of Nvidia’s chips in training large language models and AI applications.



Nvidia’s Stock Has Soared Over 200% in the Past Year



Nvidia’s stock has soared more than 200% in the past year, closing in on the valuations of tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).



As of the market close on May 31, 2024, Nvidia’s stock price stood at $1,095.95, with a market cap of $2.70 trillion. The company has demonstrated impressive returns over the past five years, with a 3,069.25% increase in stock price. Nvidia’s strong financial performance is further evidenced by its profit margin of 53.40%, return on assets of 49.10%, and return on equity of 115.66%. The company also boasts a healthy cash position, with $31.44 billion in total cash and a low total debt/equity ratio of 22.37%.

This surge follows the broader trend of GameStop’s stock, which has also experienced a significant increase in premarket climbing close to 100%.



Trader profits big on GME crypto token



One particularly savvy trader has capitalized on this market movement. This trader had set a limit order that was triggered, resulting in the sale of 3.5 million GME for 260 SOL (approximately $43,000) at a price of $0.01226 per GME.

Despite this sale, the trader still holds a substantial position of 108 million GME, valued at approximately $1.5 million. To date, the total profit from these trades amounts to around $1.37 million. 



For those who followed this trader’s moves and bought GME when recommended, the profit would currently be more than five times their initial investment when viewing the transactions and holdings on Solscan.

Boeing Continues to Face Pressing Challenges Amid Safety Crisis - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Boeing (NYSE: BA), once a leading force in the aerospace industry, is grappling with an unprecedented safety crisis and production issues that have eroded customer trust and shareholder value. The company’s long-term safety concerns, recent incidents, and regulatory scrutiny have overshadowed its prospects.



Recently, Emirates president Tim Clark discussed the firm and how it could take years for Boeing to get its house in order. The company’s shares have lost over 49% in the last five years, a period of significant turbulence for the aviation giant.



Safety Crisis at Boeing has Been a Decade in the Making



The safety crisis at Boeing has been a decade in the making, with many speculating that the company’s shift from engineering excellence to cost-cutting and profit maximization was at the heart of the problem. Boeing’s push to extract cost cuts from suppliers and outsource work previously done in-house has led to significant quality issues and supply chain disruptions.



The company’s governance model, which became more focused on financial metrics, has negatively impacted its engineering and quality control processes.



Following the Alaska Airlines (NYSE: ALK) incident in January, where a door plug detached mid-flight, the FAA has capped the production rates of the 737 Max planes and increased oversight on Boeing’s production lines. The FAA has emphasized the need for systemic change at Boeing, focusing on meeting quality and safety milestones before any increase in production can be approved.



In response, Boeing has developed an 11-page Product Safety and Quality Plan, which includes investing in workforce training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects, and elevating the safety and quality culture.





Alaska Airlines Incident and Future Challenges



The ongoing issues at Boeing have taken a toll on the company’s business, with customers expressing frustration and disappointment over the production issues. Boeing revealed it burned through £1 billion a month in the first quarter of the year after slowing production and paying £347 million in compensation. The company’s shares have fallen by nearly a third since the Alaska Airlines incident, reflecting the financial impact of the crisis.



Boeing’s problems are not limited to the company itself. They affect the global aviation industry, with supply chain disruptions also impacting Airbus and other manufacturers. Emirates president Tim Clark predicts a five-year hiatus for Boeing to address and recover from these issues, highlighting the long road ahead for the company.



As Boeing works to address its safety and production issues, it faces increased scrutiny from regulators and legal authorities. The FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board, and the American government are all closely monitoring the company’s actions. Additionally, the US Department of Justice has filed a case accusing Boeing of breaching its obligations in a 2021 agreement that shielded the company from criminal prosecution over past crashes.

Binance Users Lose Millions After Accounts Hacked


Several Binance users have reported losing millions of dollars due to account hacks in a distressing development for the cryptocurrency community. The news came to light when Chinese cryptocurrency journalist Colin Wu tweeted about a series of hacks that have affected users of the platform.Wu's tweet highlighted the case of a Chinese user who lost $1 million after downloading a Google plugin promoted by Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) called Aggr. The attack occurred on May 24 and was facilitated through cross-trading, a technique where hackers exploit hijacked cookies to bypass password and two-factor authentication (2FA) verification. Another Binance user experienced a similar fate on March 1, suffering significant financial loss. The hackers used the same method of hijacked cookies to gain access to the victim's account, indicating a well-coordinated and persistent attack strategy.Binance user questions platformOne of the victims, known as Nakamao, shared his harrowing experience on X, revealing the emotional and financial toll of the incident. He recounted that he became a victim of an undercover agent in the crypto circle, and $1 million in his Binance account was wiped out. Nakamao’s investigation, conducted in collaboration with a security company, uncovered alarming details. He realized that he had fallen victim to an elaborate scheme involving an undercover agent in the community. Nakamao's account of the incident also raised serious concerns about Binance's response and security measures. He noted several critical points in the timeline of events.For instance, Binance was reportedly aware of the hacker and the compromised plugin for weeks but did not take immediate action, allowing further financial losses. Despite recognizing the theft and abnormal cross-trading activities, Nakamao says that Binance failed to implement adequate risk controls, allowing hackers to manipulate accounts for over an hour.According to the user, Binance did not promptly freeze the hacker’s account, missing the opportunity to prevent further unauthorized transactions. Nakamao further revealed that it took Binance more than a day to contact relevant platforms to freeze transactions, further delaying the mitigation of losses.These revelations have sparked a wave of concern and criticism within the cryptocurrency community, with many users questioning the platform's ability to safeguard their assets. The incidents show the importance of heightened security measures and prompt action in the face of emerging threats.

Are Bitcoin ETFs drawing capital away from Gold? VanEck CEO says... - AMBCrypto



BTC ETFs attracted inflows from Gold ETFs, per a VanEck executive. 
BTC could be closer to a parabolic run following a key update on the US money supply. 

Market watchers have long speculated that US spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs could draw flows from Gold ETFs. According to VanEck’s CEO, Jan Van Eck, this has become a reality. 
On the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week 2024, the VanEck executive underscored that Gold ETFs have seen outflows despite hitting record highs and rallying 14% in 2024. 
“There are outflows out of Gold bullion ETFs in the US this year even as it (gold) hits all-time highs and is up 14% this year.” 
Van Eck added that, based on a Google search analysis, investors’ interest in ‘Bitcoin dominated gold.’ 
Despite the above interesting developments, US Bitcoin ETFs added about 30K BTC in May, but demand stagnated. 
Bitcoin ETF demand stagnates, but …
In May, the US spot BTC ETFs recorded net positive flows and added 29.5K BTC, factoring GBTC selling. 
On 31st May, the ETFs logged a net positive inflow of $48.7 million per Soso Value data. BlackRock’s IBIT led the inflows with $169 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC’s $5.9 million. 
However, Grayscale’s GBTC dented the above inflows after recording $124.3 million in outflows last Friday, per Farside Investors data. 
When the cumulative spot BTC ETF demand was plotted against the BTC price, the chart showed that the demand stagnated along with the price. 
Source: X/HODL15Capital
However, BTC could soon hit a parabolic run. The king coin has hit a crucial and similar milestone last seen before the 2017 parabolic run – breaking above the US money supply. According to crypto analyst TechDev, 
‘In 2021 $BTC was carried to new  USD highs by increased money supply. In 2024 it’s gotten there on its own demand (and thus broke out against M1). Add the anticipated M1 growth this time and we likely see $BTC outpace expectations based in part on 2021.”
Another analyst, Peter Brandt, based on standard historical data, capped the upside of this market cycle at $130K-$150K per BTC by August 2025.

However, BTC entered a third month of price consolidation and must break above the range to confirm the uptrend momentum.

This Is When BTC Price Could Soar to $150K, According to Bitcoin Halving Cycles: Peter Brandt


																In a recent analysis, renowned crypto trader Peter Brandt predicted that bitcoin’s current bull run could see the cryptocurrency reaching a peak between $130,000 and $150,000 by late August to early September 2025.
Brandt’s projection is based on historical patterns following BTC’s previous halving events.
Bitcoin’s Bull Run Could Hit $130K-$150K
The April 20 halving, an important event coded into Bitcoin’s protocol occurring approximately every four years, cuts mining rewards by half. According to Brandt, these events have historically played a big role in shaping its bull market cycles.
In his June 2 report, he detailed how previous halving dates have “represented almost perfect symmetry within past bull market cycles.”
Specifically, he noted that the number of weeks from the start of each bull market cycle, typically marked by a significant low following a decline of over 75%, to the halving dates is almost equal to the number of weeks from the halving dates to the following bull market highs.




Analyzing past patterns, Brandt pointed to the last Bitcoin bull market, which started about 16 months before the halving on May 11, 2020, and concluded roughly 18 months later. This pattern aligns with previous cycles following the July 9, 2016, and November 28, 2012 halvings.
“If this sequence continues, the next bull market cycle high should occur in late August or early September 2025,” Brandt added. He projected a potential high in the range of $130,000 to $150,000, noting that while no method of analysis is foolproof, past highs have corresponded well with an inverted parabolic curve.
Brandt’s analysis pinpoints December 17, 2022, as the start of the current bull market, with bitcoin trading around $16,800 at that time. Since then, BTC  has surged over 300%, reaching an all-time high of $73,800 on March 14.
Peter Brandt Warns of Potential ‘Exponential Decay’
However, Brandt also offered a note of caution. He acknowledged a 25% probability that Bitcoin has already reached its bull market peak, given that each cycle’s gains are reducing when compared to the previous one. He also warned that if bitcoin fails to surpass its previous high and drops below $55,000, it could signify an “exponential decay” in its market value.
In a previous blog post, Brandt highlighted that around 80% of the exponential momentum from each of the last four BTC bull cycles has reduced. Looking forward, he forecasted an exponential growth of approximately 4.5 times the current value.
While he recognized the halving’s potential to influence bitcoin’s value positively, Brandt stressed the importance for traders to watch for signs of exponential decay carefully.

New Solana Memecoin Book of Kittens (BOOKKIT) to Explode 14,000% Within 48 Hours



                    

Book of Kittens (BOOKKIT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.



Currently, Book of Kittens can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Book of Kittens could become the next viral memecoin.



In fact, many early Shiba Inu and Dogecoin investors have been pouring funds into this new Solana memecoin.



Book of Kittens launched with over $3,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Book of Kittens on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Book of Kittens by entering its contract address – 94RxfAMNaw6xePy7a6E8As7Kzv1soUEzouzwjDzYrjwa – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BOOKKIT.

Crypto trader turns $10k into $400k in 10 minutes


    Since it started in earnest late last October, the ongoing crypto market rally has seen multiple well-executed trades that led to swift and impressive rags-to-riches stories.



Recent weeks, in particular, have generated multiple moves leading to savvy cryptocurrency traders growing their investments hundreds of times over within hours, with new reports seemingly emerging every few days.



The most recent of these took place on June 2 when one trader used 60 Solana (SOL) – at the time worth just under $10,000 – to purchase nearly 90 million of a fairly new cryptocurrency called HAPPY.







Only 10 minutes later, the same address sold HAPPY for nearly 2,500 SOL – worth approximately $400,000 – per the observations made by Lookonchain on X.



In total, the investment rapidly grew as much as 3,900%.

HAPPY was launched by an X user known as bazingahappy, who, again, according to Lookonchain, previously spent approximately $14,000 worth of SOL to gain control of as much as 79% of the total supply of the cryptocurrency. 



Bazingahappy, however, made a point of replying to Lookonchain to clarify they are not the one to have made the stunningly successful 10-minute trade.



Trading new cryptos remains risky despite the potential upsides



Though much has been said in recent weeks of traders who turned less than $1,000 into $650,000 in hours trading cryptocurrencies or those who grew their investments from tens of thousands to millions of dollars within days, it is important to remember that rags-to-riches stories are not the only staple of crypto bull markets to have reemerged in 2024.



Indeed, though trading altcoins and meme coins – and particularly newly-released such cryptocurrencies – is always risky, the dangers are only made greater by the fact that old-fashioned scams and simple yet costly mistakes are still more than common.



For example, one of the members of the team behind the fairly new Slerf (SLERF) meme coin accidentally burned $10 million worth of investments immediately upon the cryptocurrency’s launch. 



Near the same time, another meme coin – CondomSOL – proved a simple rug pull, leaving many hopeful investors out in the cold.

Orbs announced the integration of its Liquidity Center with SpookySwap, a popular automated market maker (AMM) on the Fantom blockchain.
Orbs Opened Liquidity Center in Fantom, Integrated with SpookySwap
This move aims to improve the on-chain trading experience for Fantom users by providing deeper liquidity and improved pricing.


Orbs' Liquidity Center is now integrated with SpookySwap, enabling liquidity providers to deliver better on-chain trading experiences to users on the Fantom network.
The integration leverages Orbs' advanced layer-3 (L3) technology to improve pricing, reduce transaction slippage, and deliver gas-free transactions.





This marks Orbs Liquidity Hub's fifth deployment on an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chain, following successful integrations with Quickswap on Polygon PoS, zkEVM Thena on BNB Chain, and IntentX on Base.
Orbs Liquidity Hub is fully decentralized and interoperable, providing liquidity both on-chain and off-chain without compromising custody rights or the permissionless nature of DeFi.

OpenAI Expands ChatGPT Services to Universities and Nonprofits with New Educational and Discount Programs



                    

OpenAI has introduced two significant initiatives aimed at broadening the accessibility of its ChatGPT services to educational and nonprofit sectors. 



The first initiative, “ChatGPT Edu,” targets universities and is tailored specifically for use by students, faculty, researchers, and for operational purposes on campuses. 




This specialized version promises enterprise-level security and controls, and is designed to be economically feasible for educational institutions.



Numerous universities, including prestigious ones like Oxford, Wharton, the University of Texas at Austin, Arizona State University, and Columbia University, are already utilizing ChatGPT in various capacities. 



For instance, researchers at Columbia are leveraging the AI to create strategies that could prevent drug overdoses. 




Similarly, at Arizona State University, an assistant professor has crafted a “GPT Buddy” that aids students in practicing German through conversational interactions at their convenience.



Kyle Bowen, Deputy CIO at Arizona State University, expressed strong support for the ChatGPT Edu initiative, stating, “Integrating OpenAI’s technology into our educational and operational frameworks accelerates transformation at ASU. 



“We’re collaborating across our community to harness these tools, extending our learnings as a scalable model for other institutions.”

The second initiative from OpenAI focuses on supporting nonprofit organizations by providing additional tools and reducing costs for ChatGPT usage. 



Nonprofits can now register for the “ChatGPT Team” service at a discounted rate of $20 per user per month, with further discounts up to 50% available for larger nonprofits poised for substantial deployment.



Both the ChatGPT Edu and ChatGPT for Nonprofits programs offer access to OpenAI’s latest models, including GPT-4o, and include features such as image generation, collaborative workspaces, and the ability to create custom GPTs.



In related developments, OpenAI has recently made its GPT-4o model accessible to non-paying users. 



This free tier allows users to utilize search features, load custom GPTs, generate images, upload files, and integrate web responses. 



However, creating personal custom GPTs and unlimited use of the GPT-4o model still require a subscription to a paid service level.

Over $3 Billion In Ether Leaves Exchanges as Whale Accumulation Soars ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
More than $3 billion worth of ETH has exited exchanges amidst a surge in whale accumulation. Following the green light for the Ethereum Spot ETF on May 24, 2024, investors have been pulling their ETH from exchanges, hopeful that subsequent approvals could prompt significant price spikes.



Analyst “burakkesmeci” from Cryptoquant revealed this trend on Monday, noting a withdrawal of over 800,000 Ethereum from exchanges post-ETF approval, amounting to roughly $3 billion over an 8-day period.



And while the identity of those behind these sizable purchases remains elusive, the pundit pointed to either whales or individuals anticipating price increases post-ETF approval, terming the trend as bullish.



“Who is behind the purchases exceeding $3 billion? I can provide two different answers to this question. Whales or individuals who think the price will rise after the Spot ETF approval. Institutions preparing for the Spot ETF could be behind this wave of heavy outflow that lasted for 8 days,” wrote the pundit.



 “We can expect that the withdrawal of more than 800,000 Ethereum from exchanges in 8 days will have a positive impact on the price in the medium term,” he added.

&nbsp







This development echoes sentiments by analysts from Intotheblock, another crypto firm, which noted the intensification of whale accumulation in ETH. On May 31st, the firm reported that currently, 41% of the Ethereum supply is held by addresses with more than 1% of the total supply, marking an increase from 36% at the beginning of the year. This surge consolidates wealth and signifies growing confidence among larger stakeholders in Ethereum’s future.



Elsewhere, analysts like Michael Nadeau, Founder of the Defi Report, foresee significant growth in ETH ETFs. In a recent tweet, the pundit predicted a potential reallocation of funds from BTC ETFs into ETH ETFs when they commence trading, the emergence of a balanced BTC-ETH investment strategy, and the likelihood of institutions flocking to Ethereum amid its relative underappreciation compared to Bitcoin.



According to the pundit, Ethereum’s unique attributes, such as its lack of structural selling pressures faced by Bitcoin miners, a significant portion of its supply being locked in staking contracts and DeFi applications, and its pivotal role in the Web3 ecosystem, could help it rival Bitcoin as the new financial infrastructure, garnering attention from institutional investors. Notably, just last week, Bernstein analysts projected substantial growth in the cryptocurrency ETF market, estimating it to reach $450 billion within two years.



That said, despite the flurry of developments, Ethereum maintained a sideways trajectory on Monday, further extending a two-week-long consolidation phase that has enveloped its price action. ETH was trading at $3,811 at press time, reflecting a modest 0.89% uptick over the past 24 hours.

Will Polygon's new 10M milestone help MATIC prices? - AMBCrypto



Polygon was close to approaching 10 million monthly active users on the network.
Price of MATIC declined, along with network growth and transaction count.

Despite the increasing popularity of other cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks, Polygon [MATIC] continued to attract a growing number of users to its platform.
Monthy activity on the decline
Data from token terminal indicated that the number of users on the Polygon network were close to 10 million at the time of writing.
Source: X
The surge in activity on the network was driven by the popularity of the Polygon ecosystem. Despite the rising activity on the network, the state of DeFi on the network wasn’t as positive.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Artemis’ data revealed that the DEX (Decentralized Exchange Volumes) on the network had fallen significantly over the last few days.
Adding to that, the TVL (Total Value Locked) on the Polygon network also fell significantly during this period. According to the data, the daily TVL collected from Polygon fell from $1 billion to $942 million over the last few days.
Screenshot: Artemis
Due to these factors, the fees generated by the network have fallen materially. Coupled with that the revenue generated by the network declined significantly.
If these problems continue, it would be hard for Polygon to be able to scale and have funds to make improvements to the network.
Source: Artemis
The number of code commits occurring on the Polygon network had declined materially over the past month. Additionally, the number of core developers on the network had also fallen significantly.
If this trend continues, the number of updates and upgrades occurring on the network could slow down. New updates and upgrades help improve sentiment around the network.
They also help attract new users to network and retain old ones.

How is MATIC holding up?
The price of MATIC wasn’t doing too well either. At the time of writing, the price of MATIC was $0.7062 reflecting a decline of 1.82% over the past month.
The network growth of the token had also plummeted during this period, indicating a decline in interest from new addresses.
Moreover, the transaction volume around Polygon had also fallen significantly implying that the frequency with which MATIC was being traded at, had fallen as well.

This is How Many Shiba Inu (SHIB) Tokens Got Burned Last Month


																TL;DR

Shiba Inu’s burning efforts in May experienced a 78% decline compared to April.
The layer-2 blockchain solution Shibarium surpassed 5 million blocks and 400 million transactions, enhancing the ecosystem’s growth.


The Burning in May
The popular meme coin project Shiba Inu continues to see a substantial amount of tokens removed from its circulating supply. Data shows that almost 370 million assets were burned throughout May via 328 transactions. This figure represents a 78.23% decline compared to the one observed for the whole of April.


The burning mechanism is an essential part of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem, whose goal is to reduce the enormous supply of tokens, making them scarcer and potentially more valuable in time. Over the past few years, the Shiba Inu team has sent over 410 trillion assets, or 41% of the circulating supply, to a null address. 
Meanwhile, SHIB’s price is slightly in the green on a monthly scale, currently trading at approximately $0.00002504. The meme coin has also experienced a whopping 190% spike in the past year, emerging as one of the best performers in the crypto market for that time frame.




Shibarium’s Advancement
Another factor that may positively impact the price of Shiba Inu is the further development of the layer-2 scaling solution, Shibarium. It officially saw the light of day in August last year and has since passed countless milestones.
Most recently, the total blocks processed on the network exceeded the 5 million mark. Prior to that, the total number of transactions surpassed 400 million, whereas wallet addresses crossed 1.8 million.
Shibarium is designed to support the advancement of the Shiba Inu ecosystem by lowering transaction fees, improving speed, encouraging community participation, and enhancing scalability. 
Last month, the network underwent two key updates. The first enabled compatibility with popular self-custody wallets, such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, and others. The second aims to empower the community of developers and innovators, implement quicker block processing times, and improve the overall user experience.

Cryptocurrencies Will Determine US Elections: Huge Cryptocurrency Donation Received from Coinbase! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the USA, donated $25 million to the pro-cryptocurrency political action committee Fairshake, to which Ripple and a16z also donated, as the US presidential election approaches, which could change the fate of cryptocurrencies.
According to Fox Business, this donation from Coinbase increased Fairshake's total donation amount to $160 million and made Fairshake among the five largest political committees during the election period.


These donated funds support the Fairshake political action committee [PAC] and its affiliates, which are focused on supporting pro-crypto congressional candidates.
At this point, Fairshake has already spent over $40 million supporting pro-cryptocurrency candidates in the House and Senate races.





Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the following about the donation:

“Cryptocurrency voters will not be taken seriously until they send a clear message to political candidates that being against crypto is bad policy.
Therefore, the simple conclusion is that we should support pro-crypto candidates on both sides of the aisle and vote out anti-crypto candidates.
We are deeply involved in policy efforts when it comes to our mission to increase economic freedom by increasing the adoption of cryptocurrencies.
The House and Senate, among other things, help determine what crypto legislation to pass, so increasing the number of pro-crypto members is critical.”

GameStop Nearly Doubles in Pre-Market Trading as Roaring Kitty Returns Again - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsAfter abruptly going silent two weeks ago, the Roaring Kitty Twitter account is back. And so too is the GameStop share price, which has nearly doubled in pre-market trading to $38.88 at the time of writing.The Twitter account belongs to Keith Gill, a financial analyst turned stock and meme influencer. He was instrumental in the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, which saw the GME share price shoot to an all-time high of $483. The huge swing led to big gains for some retail investors and staggering losses for a number of hedge funds.Early on Monday morning, the account posted an image of an Uno reverse card—presumably walking back the "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"-themed farewell sent from the account on Friday, May 17.The last time the Twitter account started posting again, people were suspicious because Gill's other social media accounts on Reddit and YouTube remained silent.GME YOLO update – June 2 2024 byu/DeepFuckingValue inSuperstonkThis time, Gill's Reddit account DeepFuckingValue posted on the SuperStonk subreddit to claim that he was the GameStop whale who had been buying up $20 call options for GME with a June 21 expiry. The stock options are essentially a bet that GME will be worth more than $20 on June 21.Even before Roaring Kitty claimed to be the GME whale, his trading was getting lots of attention because its position had swelled to $116 million. It was just a few weeks ago that one GameStop whale made headlines for pocketing $44 million by selling GME options right before the Roaring Kitty Twitter account went silent.Gill's apparent return has caused the GME price to again rally, nearly doubling since Friday afternoon. That means Gill's GME bags could be worth as much as $214 million by the time markets open in the U.S. later today.But Gill's second return has not been met with universal applause.On the Wall Street Bets subreddit, one moderator wrote a post to remind the community that WSB is not a GameStop subreddit.

Trump Loves Crypto (TRUMPCRY) Will Surge 16,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Trump Loves Crypto (TRUMPCRY) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Trump Loves Crypto (TRUMPCRY), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Crypto presents a similar opportunity.



Trump Loves Crypto has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 16,000% in the coming two days, and Trump Loves Crypto could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Trump Loves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Trump Loves Crypto on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Crypto by entering its contract address – C6NUpDLHJT7eZbUwzv8Fu4Rx3X8CD4MapRGD6pZ6YfrH – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCRY.

562,000,000 People Across the Globe Now Own Cryptocurrency, According to New Study - The Daily Hodl


								Roughly 6.8% of the global population now holds crypto assets, according to digital currency payment company Triple-A.
In a new report, Triple A says the number of people who own cryptocurrency is now 562 million, up by about 34% from 420 million in 2023.










Of the countries worldwide, the United Arab Emirates has the highest cryptocurrency ownership rate at 25.3%, followed by Singapore at 24.4%. 
Other leading countries include Turkey (19.3%), Argentina (18.9%), Thailand (17.6%), Brazil (17.4%), Vietnam (17.4%), United States (15.5%), Saudi Arabia (15.0%), Malaysia (14.3%) and Hong Kong (14.3%).
Says Triple-A,
“Among the top 30 countries with the highest ownership rate, we find countries from various continents and economic standings – ranging from emerging markets like Turkey and Argentina to smaller economies such as Slovenia and Luxembourg.
Asia strengthens its reputation as a hub for digital currency adoption and innovation, with 10 of its countries ranking among the top 30 globally with the highest adoption rates.”
As to what drives the global surge in cryptocurrency ownership, Triple-A points to regulatory changes that paved the way for the approval of Bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Discussions of crypto events such as the Bitcoin halving and the expanding educational resources that address the growing demand for information about digital assets also attract new investors. 
The report says macroeconomic factors such as inflation and currency devaluation also fuel the rising adoption of cryptocurrencies.
Triple-A says new opportunities await as more people are likely to embrace crypto.
“With half a billion users globally, increased regulation, and technological advancements, cryptocurrency adoption and use rates will continue to rise.”

Cardano Founder on Scaling: 'Things Could Move Very Fast'

In a recent tweet, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson addressed concerns over scaling within the ADA community. Hoskinson highlighted that the Cardano treasury has sufficient funds to pursue an aggressive Leios, Hydra and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) scaling program if the community decides to pursue this direction."For those discussing scaling, there is enough money in the treasury to pursue an aggressive Leios, Hydra, and ZK program if the community wants to go in this direction," Hoskinson stated. Advocating for a parallel approach, Hoskinson pointed out that Cardano has the infrastructure and talent required to undertake multiple scaling initiatives simultaneously. This approach would enable the blockchain to address immediate scaling needs while planning for future demands.Reflecting on the significant advancements made over the past two years, Hoskinson expressed optimism about the potential for rapid progress in scaling Cardano. The significant upgrades and innovations introduced in the last 24 months have laid a strong foundation for further development on the Cardano blockchain."I also believe things could move very fast, given all the enhancements we've seen over the last 24 months," Hoskinson remarked. This optimism is grounded in the continuous improvements to Cardano's infrastructure, which have enhanced the platform's scalability, security and functionality. These include the Vasil Upgrade in September 2022, which brought increased functionality, performance and scalability by enhancing Cardano's smart contract capabilities through Plutus v2. The Valentine upgrade in February 2023 included support for SECP256k1, which Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance Coin use for public key cryptography.Cardano's founder's statement no doubt attracted reactions from the ADA community. Rick McCracken DIGI, a Cardano SPO, commented: "I would like to see rapid scaling. At the same time I would no want to see rapid depletion of the treasury since there is enough Ada in there to tank the price, thus costing more Ada to pay for the same level of effort. But, yes, the more scalability the better."

Notcoin: the price of the crypto of the Telegram ecosystem is unstoppable

Notcoin, a crypto belonging to the GameFi ecosystem of Telegram, is in excellent shape: yesterday it recorded a price pump of about 90%, nearing the quotation of 0.3 dollars per token which would have brought the circulating capitalization of the asset to 3 billion dollars.
Let’s delve into the origins of Notcoin in this article and see what the future price predictions are.
All the details below.

Crypto and Telegram: what is the play-to-earn token Notcoin and why is the price on the rise?
Notcoin (NOT) is a Play-to-Earn crypto that plants its roots within the Telegram ecosystem, primarily used as a play resource earned by players for completing certain activities.
Specifically, it is a Tap-to-Earn game, where the crypto is redeemed simply by tapping a button that symbolizes a virtual coin. 
Each touch earns 1 Notcoin, with a limit before the player’s energy needs to be recharged: there are also special features such as boosters and turbo mode that can increase earnings.
Created by Open Builders, a team that focuses on enhancing the development of successful dapps on the Ton blockchain, NOT was first launched on May 16 through the Kucoin exchange and has already established itself as a top 50 token in the CoinMarketCap ranking.
Its success derives from the simple yet engaging gameplay and above all from the strategic use of the vast user base of Telegram, which amounts to over 500 million individuals.
The simple and intuitive design, and the narrative of easy earnings, has allowed to build loyalty among a wide range of players, who can also participate in special missions, enter the rankings, and buy upgrades.
Since its debut, the platform has attracted over 35 million participants, becoming by far the most successful game in the Telegram ecosystem.
The crypto NOT relies directly on the blockchain of ton (The Open Network), offering an economic and scalable infrastructure, capable of activating a lively community and maximizing the trading of the resource on the market.
Another component that has favored the emergence of Notcoin is the social engagement that preceded the listing of the crypto in the markets, with many Twitter influencers who have sponsored the coin, also launching several giveaways and airdrop.
The crypto Notcoin has a total supply of 102.7 billion NOT tokens which coincides with the circulating supply. Of this, 78% (approximately 80.2 billion tokens) is allocated to the initial miners and the Telegram community. The remaining 22% is reserved for new users, traders, and future development phases.

Notcoin: 90% pump in a single day, where can it go?
Yesterday the crypto Notcoin (NOT) recorded a remarkable pump of 90%, bringing its price from the opening 0.015 dollars to the maximum of 0.029 dollars, and then closing the day at 0.022 dollars.
The currency for a few hours entered the ranking of the top 50 dollars by market capitalization, nearing the overall valuation of 3 billion dollars: a result to be proud of for a currency born just on May 16.
In the middle of yesterday’s pump NOT surpassed in market capitalization the memecoins FLOKI and BONK, warning WIF and PEPE that it could soon overtake them as well.

In the world of finance, the terms “bull” and “bear” are often used to describe market trends. A “bull” market is characterized by rising prices, while a “bear” market is marked by falling prices. Understanding these concepts is crucial for investors.
After the first 10 days from the listing on the crypto markets, which were characterized by an uninviting price action with tendencies towards price lateralization/distribution, NOT started the real bull climb, growing by 400% in a very short time.
After the FOMO recorded in yesterday’s session, Notcoin traders have pushed the coin back to the $0.30 level, triggering a potential retracement in the coming days.
Even though the main trend remains bullish, the extension of the recent upward movement suggests that shortly this crypto could take a step back and return at least below 0.20 dollars.
In particular, even though many crypto influencers “shill” the price target of 1 dollar for NOT; this remains unlikely for the moment.
Attention to the volatility in the coming days!

A special mention goes especially to the trading volumes recorded in the last 24 hours by NOT, which has attracted trades for a whopping 16.3 billion dollars, even surpassing ETH, SOL, and PEPE.
This data is representative of the attention of investors for this kind of coins with highly promising potential, and at the same time with a considerable intrinsic risk.
It will be interesting to monitor the trend of volumes in the coming days: in case of a decrease in the amount of trading, we can expect a sharp drop in the price of the crypto.

PEW Memecoin Surges Over 1,200% Amid Multiple CEX Listings - Coin Edition


							

Newly launched PEW memecoin attracts interest from crypto traders.



HTX, MEXC, LBank, CoinEx, and BitMart list PEW in one day.



The new memecoin surged over 1,200% few days after listing.




Pepe in a Meme World (PEW) is catching the interest of cryptocurrency traders as a newly launched memecoin in the speculative crypto ecosystem. The adaptable and dynamic memecoin caused a frenzy after listing on five centralized exchanges in one day, including HTX, MEXC, LBank, CoinEx, and BitMart.







Meanwhile, despite existing for only a short period, PEW is already listed on several decentralized exchanges (DEXes). The multiple listings across different platforms make PEW accessible to many crypto traders, especially speculators who appreciate the potential benefits of memecoins.



As a result, the newly launched memecoin’s awareness among crypto users has skyrocketed, leading to increased adoption despite launching only a few days ago. PEW surged over 1,260% less than one week after launching, with the potential of reaching new highs as awareness increases.









In the typical behavior of newly launched memecoins, PEW retraced over 50% after the initial rally. However, TradingView’s data shows the crypto token encountered support around $0.00004219 earlier today and bounced to trade for $0.00005499 at the time of writing.



PEW’s price trend reflects the current investors’ outlook in the crypto market, especially with memecoins. Anticipating a significant bull run puts crypto speculators on the alert, exposing them to potentially profitable opportunities in the developing bull cycle.



Although past results do not guarantee future performance in the crypto market, the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) plays a significant role in speculative environments like the crypto market. Considering PEPE’s success in the last few months, many traders would target similar projects for potential profit, especially when such projects receive the kind of support observed with PEW, as noted with the multiple listings on CEXes and heightened awareness among crypto community members.

Linea faces criticism over block production halt - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Linea has come under scrutiny from the crypto community following its decision to unilaterally stop block production in response to a hack on Velocore, a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on its network. The move has ignited a discussion about the importance of decentralization and censorship resistance in the blockchain industry.The Velocore hack resulted in the transfer of 700 ETH, worth over $2.6 million, from the Linea network via an undisclosed third-party bridge. Linea stated that it halted the sequencer to prevent further funds from being bridged out after failing to contact the DEX team promptly. The blockchain also censored the hacker’s addresses to mitigate the impact on its users.Linea defended its actions, stating that the hacker was starting to sell a significant amount of tokens for ETH, which could have led to additional problems for users beyond the liquidity pool-draining exploit.However, the crypto community has criticized Linea’s decision, with some arguing that it contradicted the core principles of decentralization and censorship resistance.Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius Labs and a Solana supporter, acknowledged the reasoning behind the move but questioned its long-term implications. Alex Gluchowski, CEO of Matter Labs, stressed the importance of decentralization for all sequencers and called on layer-2 solutions to prioritize integrating decentralization into their platforms.In response to the criticisms, Linea reaffirmed its commitment to decentralizing its network and sequencer to prevent similar incidents in the future. The blockchain stated that its goal is to create a “permissionless, censorship-resistant environment” where the team will no longer have the power to halt block production or censor addresses.
“When our network matures to a decentralized, censorship-resistant environment, Linea’s team will no longer have the ability to halt block production and censor addresses – this is a primary goal of our network,” Linea stated.
Linea also noted that most competing networks still depend on centralized technical operations to safeguard ecosystem participants. The incident has reignited the debate about the role of centralized entities in decentralized systems and the “blockchain trilemma” challenges faced by protocols and networks on the matter of balancing security, decentralization, and scalability for users.

Polymarket Records Strongest Ever Month As Election Season Heats Up - The Defiant

Election markets have already driven more than $235 million worth of wagers on the platform.Polymarket, a crypto-native prediction market platform, posted its strongest month on record during May amid rampant election forecasting.Data from Dune Analytics shows punters placing more than $63 million worth of bets via the platform during the month of May, beating out its previous record from January by 15%.The number of active traders on the platform also skyrocketed, with nearly 13,600 users wagering on predictions last month. That equates to a month-over-month increase of 405%, also beating out December 2021’s previous all-time high of 5,711 by 138%.Monthly volume and traders on Polymarket. Source: Dune Analytics.The 2024 U.S. presidential election is already proving to be driving big business for Polymarket. The platform’s presidential winner market has attracted $147.4 million worth of prediction bets so far.For comparison, the same market on Betfair, the leading centralized betting exchange, has garnered nearly $35.2 million in action so far.Markets for the Democratic party nominee, Republican party nominee, and popular vote winner have also attracted $31.1 million, $29.7 million, and $26.5 million worth of wagers respectively.Joey Krug, a partner at Founders Fund, a venture capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel that led Polymarket’s recent $45 million funding round, said he believes it is only a matter of time before Polymarket’s monthly volume exceeds $100 million.“The criteria I always considered strong product market fit for crypto-based prediction markets was $10mm in volume a week,” Krug said. “If you can get there, there’s a path to $100mm and onwards. I think it’ll heat up further as we get into election season.”Investment roundsShane Coplan, the CEO of Polymarket, announced the company’s $45 million Series B round on May 14, noting that the blockchain-focused VCs ParaFi and Dragonfly, and Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s chief scientist, were among the investors participating in the round.Coplan also revealed a previously undisclosed $25 million Series A round led by VCs Polychain Capital and General Catalyst on the same day.“People understand what's going on in the world better because Polymarket exists,” Coplan said. “Enough of the talking heads and news-by-algorithm. We're in a misinformation pandemic, and Polymarket presents a novel information format that is driven by financial incentives for truth, rather than engagement baiting.”

Hack Forces Linea To Halt Block Production Temporarily, Here's What To Know | Bitcoinist.com


								In a noteworthy development for the blockchain community, Consensys’ Linea Layer 2 blockchain has temporarily suspended block production following a recent security compromise that led to the exploitation of funds worth millions of dollars. The purpose of this swift move was to prevent any potential exploitation of user assets and to preserve the network’s integrity.
According to the TOBTC trading platform, despite intentions to resume production and decentralize its network in the near future, the incident highlights the crucial need for Ethereum layer-2 solutions like Linea to boost decentralization efforts.
Linea Blockchain Swoops In To Save The Day
On Sunday, June 2, a hacker took advantage of vulnerabilities in the Velocore decentralized exchange, which runs on the Linea network. This act which was carried out using a third-party bridge allowed the hacker to siphon off more than 700 Ethereum (ETH) valued at $2.6 million from the blockchain.

Linea noted that Hexagate was the first to discover the hack, identifying the exploiter addresses, weak smart contracts, and stolen funds. However, the time zone variations prevented the blockchain from getting in touch with the Velocore team right away.
As a result, the blockchain platform momentarily stopped producing blocks, exposing the flaws in centralized control to prevent more harm. “Because other avenues of handling this exploit closed, our team halted the sequencer to prevent additional funds bridging out,” the platform stated.
Linea described the stoppage of block manufacturing as a “last resort” action to safeguard its users from additional harm. Specifically, the solution halted the block production between blocks 5081800 and 5081801.
During the break, the blockchain allowed the Velocore time team to assist in examining the vulnerability. Furthermore, they censored the addresses of the hackers, which greatly lessened the damage to Linea consumers’ ecology. “Like other L2s, we are still in the ‘training wheels’ phase of existence, giving us safeguards to use,” the firm added.
Decentralizing its network, including the sequencer, is Linea’s main objective. With the network developing into a decentralized, censorship-resistant ecosystem, the team will not be able to stop block production or censor addresses.
The Decision Was Not Taken Lightly
The majority of L2 solutions, such as Linea, continue to depend on centralized technical operations, which can be used to safeguard ecosystem members. Thus, this action was not an easy choice to make, considering Linea’s fundamental principle is a permissionless, censorship-resistant environment.

A significant factor underscored by the platform in its decision to halt the sequencer was the hacker’s acquisition of tokens and the subsequent sale into ETH. Beyond the vulnerability that drained the liquidity pool, this exploit would have led to significant problems for users in the ecosystem.
So far, the team has highlighted its commitment to providing a safer ecosystem for its users by developing broader threat monitoring and prevention mechanisms that were fully activated during the hack.

Bitcoin Market Dynamics: Stability and Long-Term Holding Insights


The Bitcoin (BTC) price has consistently traded within the $67,000 and $68,000 range for several days. In this analysis, BeInCrypto aims to understand the price action of Bitcoin. 
Additionally, we have observed a decline in volatility, which can be attributed to various factors. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we’ll explore who is buying and selling Bitcoin.
Examining Bitcoin Activity and Vaulting Rates
The chart below illustrates the activity rate and vaulting rate of Bitcoin over time, along with its price in USD. Here are the key observations from the chart:
Activity Rate (shown in red):
The Activity Rate shows how much Bitcoin is actively traded or moved by users, indicating how often people use or transfer their BTC.
Notable spikes and drops indicate periods of increased and decreased activity among Bitcoin holders. Significant fluctuations can be observed, particularly around key price movements. We have observed a fascinating drop in the activity rate, from 9% to -3%. This decrease in activity could indicate a trend towards long-term holding of Bitcoin.
Vaulting Rate (shown in green):
The Vaulting Rate shows how much Bitcoin users are moving into long-term storage, keeping it safe for the future (Vaulted Supply represents the percentage of Bitcoin that has been vaulted or has never been sold since its first acquisition). 
Positive vaulting rates suggest that investors are moving more BTC into long-term storage. The chart shows periods where the vaulting rate increases, potentially indicating holders’ confidence in the asset’s future value.

The decline in activity and the rise in vaultedness could explain the decreasing volatility trend.
Understanding the UTXO Value Distribution Monitor
The UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) Value Distribution Monitor analyzes BTC transactions based on the value of BTC held in different wallets. Let’s break it down in simple terms and explain what this indicator tells us.
What is UTXO?
UTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Output. It refers to the amount of Bitcoin received after a transaction that can be used in future transactions. In essence, UTXOs define where each blockchain transaction starts and finishes.
What Does the UTXO Value Distribution Monitor Show?
The colored bars represent daily changes in the amount of BTC held in different UTXO value bands:

Red Bars: Changes in UTXOs holding more than 10,000 BTC.
Violet Bars: Changes in UTXOs holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC.


What Does This Indicator Tell Us?
The UTXO Value Distribution Monitor helps us understand the behavior of BTC holders, from small investors to large whales (very large holders). Here’s what it can tell us:
Bitcoin: UTXO Value Distribution Monitor. Source: CryptoQuant
Accumulation and Distribution:
Positive changes mean more BTC remains in that value band. For example, if the red bars (10,000+ BTC) are positive, large holders accumulate more BTC.
Negative changes indicate that BTC moves out of that value band. So, if the blue bars (1,000 – 10,000 BTC) are negative, mid-range holders sell their BTC.
Market Sentiment:

If large holders (10,000+ BTC) accumulate, it suggests they have long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value.
If mid-range holders (1,000 – 10,000 BTC) are selling, they might be taking profits or reallocating their assets.
Market Dynamics:

The interaction between different value bands can indicate broader market trends. For example, if we see 1,000 – 10,000 BTC holders selling and 10,000+ BTC holders buying, it suggests that the market’s big players are confident in Bitcoin’s future at current prices, even if smaller players are less certain.
Read more: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030
In summary, Bitcoin’s price stability within the $67,000 to $68,000 range, coupled with declining volatility, suggests a maturing market. The drop in the activity rate and the rise in the vaulting rate indicate a shift towards long-term holding, reflecting increased confidence among major holders. 
The UTXO Value Distribution Monitor further supports this, showing large holders accumulating BTC while mid-range holders selling. These trends point to a market where big players are optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, reinforcing its potential as a long-term investment.

Can You Take Your Bitcoin With You After Death? Tech Enthusiast Explores The Convergence Between Crypto And Cryonics - Benzinga

“Do not stand at my grave and weep, for I have my Bitcoin.” This adage with a cryptocurrency twist may sound eccentric, but not too far from reality. Bitcoin holders are delving into the realm of cryonics, a field that offers potential life extension through freezing, to preserve the prized digital asset even after their death.What Happened: A blog post by software engineer and Bitcoin advocate, Jameson Lopp revealed that Bitcoin enthusiasts are contemplating the impact of cryonic preservation on their digital wealth. Cryonics, the practice of freezing a person’s body with the hope of future revival, poses a unique challenge for Bitcoin holders—securing their digital assets during a state of suspended animation.Lopp discussed the complexities of maintaining a Bitcoin portfolio over potentially thousands of years. He questioned the sufficiency of traditional Bitcoin securing methods, such as brain wallets or time-locked funds, due to potential external interference or technological advancements.See Also: Crypto Trader Says These Two Meme Coins Are Set To Spike — And Neither Of Them Are Dogecoin Or Shiba InuLopp considers the possibility of a multi-generational trust or an autonomous agent programmed to manage the Bitcoin holder’s assets. However, these solutions also have their own challenges, such as the longevity of legal contracts and the reliability of artificial intelligence.Despite the uncertainties, he concluded that a diversified approach, spreading assets among various legal and technical storage options, may be the best strategy for Bitcoin holders considering cryonic preservation.Why It Matters: Interest in cryonics has been on the rise, with a growing trend of pet owners and billionaires investing in cryonics. It was observed that not just the super-rich but everyday people were increasingly seeking out cryonics.The exploration of cryonics by Bitcoin holders is a significant development, as it combines two cutting-edge fields: cryptocurrency and life extension.Read Next: Elon Musk Expresses Surprise At Deepfake YouTube Video Aimed At Scamming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Holdersillustration via Shutterstock.This story was generated using Benzinga Neuro and edited by Aniket Verma.

Bitcoin Could Hit $150,000 If History Repeats - Veteran Trader


								Crypto investors are eagerly awaiting the next chapter in Bitcoin’s story, and this veteran trader just offered a potential plot twist.

In his analysis, Peter Brandt suggests Bitcoin could gallop towards a record-breaking peak of $130,000 to $150,000 by late summer 2025.
Brandt’s forecast hinges on a historical phenomenon known as the Bitcoin halving. Every four years, the number of Bitcoins awarded to miners gets cut in half, restricting supply and theoretically pushing prices upwards.
25% Chance Bitcoin Has Already Hit Its Peak
But Brandt examines deeper – he argues that past halving dates have coincided roughly with the midpoint of bull market cycles. With the most recent halving happening in April 2024, his analysis suggests a peak 16-18 months later, landing us squarely in that August-September 2025 window.

Brandt himself acknowledges the limitations of his prediction. He warns that “no method of analysis is fool-proof,” adding a cautious 25% chance that Bitcoin might have already hit its peak for this cycle. This raises a critical question – are we already past the stampede and staring down a crypto winter?
Underlying Factors For Brandt’s Analysis
There are additional factors that temper Brandt’s optimism. One is the diminishing returns of each bull cycle. While historical peaks show impressive growth, the gains seem to be moderating. The last peak fell short of its predecessor, and if this trend continues, there’s a chance we might not see a six-figure Bitcoin this time around.
Additionally, a price drop below $55,000 could signal a weakening bull and a potential correction, sending shivers down the spines of even the most dedicated hodlers (holders of cryptocurrency for the long term).

BTC market cap currently at $1.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com
Bitcoin Price Forecast
Meanwhile, the current Bitcoin price prediction indicates a strong bullish trend, projecting a substantial increase of 28% to a price of $88,600 by July 3, 2024. This optimism is supported by positive market sentiment, as reflected by technical indicators. A Bullish sentiment suggests that investors are confident in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory.
Additionally, the Fear & Greed Index, which currently stands at 73 (Greed), signals that market participants are becoming more eager to invest, potentially driving the price further up. This index level indicates a high level of market confidence and could be a precursor to sustained price increases if the sentiment persists.

Over the last 30 days, Bitcoin’s performance has shown mixed results with a 47% success rate in recording green days, indicating almost half the days were profitable. The price volatility at 4.45% suggests that while there is significant movement, it remains within a moderate range, characteristic of an active but not overly volatile market.
The combination of these factors—positive sentiment, a high Greed index, and relatively controlled volatility—paints a picture of a market poised for continued growth, assuming no significant external shocks or negative news impacts the cryptocurrency landscape.

Bitcoin, Ethereum exchange balances at record lows - What now? - AMBCrypto



CryptoQuant data shows that Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange balance has been on a decline.
Technical analysis indicates significant price movements for both cryptocurrencies if key resistance levels are broken.

Bitcoin [BTC]  was trading just shy of $70,000 at press time, reflecting a moderate upswing of 2% in the last 24 hours, though it remains below its March peak of over $73,000. 
This continued growth from the asset is part of a broader narrative that underscores the complexities of crypto market movements.
Conversely,  Ethereum [ETH] has shown remarkable stability, maintaining a position above $3,800. This steadiness comes despite a slight 2.5% drop over the last day, stabilizing with a minimal 0.7% increase today. 
The stability in Ethereum’s price points to a sustained interest in the asset amid fluctuating market conditions.
Bitcoin & Ethereum market shifts
Recent analysis by BTC-ECHO’s Leon Waidmann revealed that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have witnessed their lowest exchange balance levels in years. 
Specifically, Bitcoin’s presence on exchanges has reduced to 11.6% while Ethereum’s has dipped to 10.6%. 
Source: Leon Waidmann on X
This trend suggests a significant movement of these assets away from exchanges and potentially indicates a strategy among investors to hold onto their coins for longer periods.
Source: CryptoQuant
AMBCrypto’s examination of CryptoQuant data further revealed a substantial outflow of these cryptocurrencies from exchanges.
 Over $5 million worth of Bitcoin and more than $1 billion in Ethereum have withdrawn from exchanges since early May.
 This movement is noteworthy as it follows the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the US, hinting at a possible supply squeeze on the horizon.
Source: CryptoQuant
The reduction in exchange reserves implies that fewer coins are now available for immediate trading, pointing to a potential price increase due to scarcity. 
Waidmann anticipates this will lead to a supply squeeze, urging investors to prepare for significant market movements, noting:
“Whales continue to accumulate. Supply squeeze incoming. Get ready for the next big move.”
Market dynamics and technical analysis
However, Glassnode data presents a contrasting view, showing an increase in the circulating supply for both cryptocurrencies, suggesting that despite reduced exchange availability, the overall market supply remains high.
Source: Glasssnode
This scenario sets the stage for potential price corrections if demand fails to keep pace with the increasing supply. However, the current market indicators suggest demand is keeping up, as there has been no notable price dip despite the growing supply.
Source: Glasssnode
Meanwhile, there is a decline in new addresses for both Bitcoin and Ethereum which could indicate a cooling interest among new investors, potentially impacting future demand. 
Source: Glasssnode
Meanwhile, technical analysis of both Bitcoin and Ethereum’s charts reveals a potentially intriguing performance on the horizon. 
Focusing on Bitcoin’s daily chart, it illustrates a pattern where the cryptocurrency has been breaking through lower support levels, recently reversing to tap into a major supply zone. 
Source: TradingView
This movement typically signals a continuation of the downtrend. However, if Bitcoin surpasses the $72,000 mark, breaking the previous lower high and negating the bearish setup, this could suggest a reversal to an upward trend.
AMBCrypto, citing an analyst from XBTManager on CryptoQuant, reported that Bitcoin is poised for a notable ascent. The analyst suggests, 
“Bitcoin is gathering strength for the next rise. When it gathers enough strength, a sharp rise seems to be imminent. It seems likely that rises akin to those seen in Q3-Q4 will continue.”

A similar pattern emerges on Ethereum’s daily chart. Ethereum has recently entered a major supply zone, suggesting an impending sell-off. 
Nonetheless, if Ethereum breaks above the $4,000 threshold, surpassing the recent lower high and overturning the current sell signal, this could pave the way for an upward movement.

Institutional Investors Are Flowing Money into Bitcoin (BTC) and These Two Altcoins! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin has been following a horizontal course in recent weeks, it has been oscillating between $ 67,000 and $ 68,000.
While the overall upward expectation in the market continues, Coinshares published its weekly cryptocurrency report.


Stating that there was an inflow of 185 million dollars in cryptocurrency investment products last week, Coinshares said that the inflows from the beginning of the year to date have exceeded the limit of 15 billion dollars.
Sentiment on Ethereum (ETH) Has Changed!
When looking at crypto funds individually, it was seen that the majority of fund inflows were in Bitcoin.





While BTC experienced an inflow of $148 million, the largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH) experienced a major turnaround and experienced an inflow of $33.5 million this week.
There was an outflow of $3.5 million in the short BTC fund indexed to the decline of Bitcoin.


When we look at other altcoins, Solana (SOL) experienced an inflow of $5.8 million, Chainlink (LINK) $1 million, and Litecoin (LTC) $0.6 million.

“Bitcoin saw a total inflow of $148 million, while short-bitcoin saw a total outflow of $3.5 million for another week, indicating that sentiment among ETF investors remains positive.
Ethereum saw inflows for a second week following the approval by the SEC of a spot ETF expected to launch in July 2024.
This represents a turnaround in investor sentiment regarding ETH, which previously experienced a total outflow of $200 million over 10 weeks.
This positive news for Ethereum also affected Solana, which recorded another $5.8 million inflow last week.”

When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, it was seen that the USA ranked first with an inflow of 130 million dollars.





After the USA, Switzerland ranked second with 36.8 million dollars, and Canada ranked third with 24.6 million dollars.
Against these inflows, Sweden received 5.1 million dollars; Brazil, on the other hand, experienced an outflow of 4.4 million dollars.

Crypto trader Ali Martinez has shared that he expects Bitcoin to stage a substantial surge if a scenario he described plays out.Bitcoin eyes surge to $74,400According to Martinez’s tweet, Bitcoin is currently breaking out from a symmetrical triangle pattern. BTC is targeting breaking out above the upper trend line. A proper close above the resistance level at $69,330 is likely to give Bitcoin momentum to surge to the $74,400 price level, the analyst wrote. A symmetrical triangle forms on the charts when an asset’s price goes through consolidation and, thus, it generates two converging trend lines with slopes opposite of each other that strive to meet.Today, June 3, the world’s flagship cryptocurrency demonstrated a 2% increase, rising from $67,755 to the $69,100 price mark, where it is changing hands as of this writing. A price increase from the current level to the above-mentioned $74,400 would comprise 7.71%. The 2% rise took place after a sudden 2.19% decline on Friday.Michael Saylor welcomes major new institutional Bitcoin investorVocal Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, the largest BTC corporate holder, has taken to the X platform to praise a new type of institutional player stepping in to invest in Bitcoin via a spot ETF based on it.He shared a video about a discussion of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board investing a substantial amount of funds into spot Bitcoin ETF shares. The amount of cash put into the ETF totals $180 million – which is less than one percent of the overall worth of the assets run by this institution, $180 billion. David Krause, an associate professor at Marquette University College of Business Administration, believes that this investment is likely to be just an entry point. Krause reckons the pension fund so far is testing this to see the reaction of the public to its purchase of spot Bitcoin ETFs and is making a trial run of it.The professor believes that this Bitcoin ETF investment is hardly going to impact the fund’s overall investment strategy unless it decides to build a 1% or 2% position in it. Citing this video, Michael Saylor tweeted, saying that “fiscally sound pension funds see the value of Bitcoin.”

Evolution of Bitcoin Mining: A Journey into Cryptocurrency's Backbone

Bitcoin is the first decentralized and one of the most popular digital currencies. It offers peer-to-peer transfers without the involvement of intermediaries like banks, government, or brokers, using Blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed immutable ledger that allows maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. It is a shared database that stores data in blocks chained together by cryptography.
Bitcoin mining is a process of minting new coins and validating ongoing transactions by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.
This article explains in detail what is bitcoin mining, how it works, what is bitcoin halving including how bitcoin mining evolved with time, and what economics and issues you need to know when you are exploring bitcoin mining.
What Is Bitcoin Mining?
Bitcoin mining is a process of minting new coins and validating ongoing transactions by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.
It is probably some heavy, expensive machinery in remote parts of the world and suit-face workers with hard hats digging deep underneath the earth’s surface to find natural resources like coal or diamond.
Well, bitcoin miners aren’t suit-faced humans working in remote parts, but it’s a network of powerful computers worldwide. These miners add individual blocks to a Bitcoin’s blockchain network, validating ongoing transactions by solving complex cryptographic puzzles, thereby getting the reward in return: A Bitcoin. Whoever solves the puzzle first wins the prize.

How Does Bitcoin Mining Works?

Bitcoin Mining is a guessing game.

Let’s dive into this quote through a scenario. Let’s say you and your friends have been tasked to guess a number between 1 and 1000. Let’s say the number you have to guess is 25; then, you don’t need to guess an exact number, but you have to be the first one to guess a number less than or equal to 25. 
If you came up with a number 55, and one of your friends came up with 27, another 67, and yet another 80, they lost because they all came up with a number more than 25.
But if you have five friends left and one of them guessed 20, then they win, and the remaining others don’t get a chance to guess. The one who guessed 20 was first to guess a number less than or equal to 25.
Here, number 25 represents the target Hash created by the Bitcoin network for a block, and random guesses by you and your friends are guesses made by miners to solve this puzzle. The solution that our computer or miner tries to find for the puzzle given is called “Hash.” So, what is Hash?
The Hash
The Hash is a 64-digit hexadecimal number generated by sending the information in the block through the SHA256 hashing algorithm. In less than a second, this could be done by sending some content into a SHA256 hash generator. 
SHA256 is an encryption method the Bitcoin network uses to create a block hash. However, decrypting that hash back is impossible, as it can take centuries to decode with modern technology.
 Hash might look like this (this is the previous paragraph run through a hash generator). If you change one value in that content, like switching one “b” to an “a,” the hash changes:
A65f83a5db7371eeefa2287a0ede750ac623e49a8ba29f248eb785fe0a678559
            Here is the same paragraph, but the first word is misspelled as “Ba” instead of “Bt”:
Fbfa43ff980d1492b3a9275a1eb945d89bd6b699ca19c3c470021b8f253654af
This is the number called block hash, which also acts as the following block’s header. Each block uses the previous Block’s Hash, forming a chain and creating the term “Blockchain.”
The process of guessing the correct number (Hash) is known as proof of work.
Proof of Work 
When a node guesses the number first or solves the puzzle first, the entire network comes to a consensus about that node to validate a transaction because this particular node has done a certain amount of work to solve the puzzle. 
That is why the consensus algorithm used in the Bitcoin network is called “Proof of Work .”It consumes much energy and computational power to reach the goal of less than or equal to the target hash. The work done in this process is viewed as validation proof, so it’s called proof-of-work.
The difficulty of mining increases as more miner joins the network. 
Confirmation
Each block contains a hash of the previous block- so when the next Block’s Hash is created, it’s connected; that’s how forming a network is. Even a single change in character in a block changes the Hash, thus changing the Hash of all of the following blocks. This process secured the Blockchain.
The block closed and received reward is only confirmed five blocks later when it’s through many validations.

Evolution of Bitcoin Mining
In the early days of Bitcoin, there were few miners out there. Therefore, general computers with regular CPUs dominated Bitcoin mining. Satoshi, the inventor of Bitcoin, and his friend Hal Finney, along with a few people, were mining Bitcoin with their personal computers using their computer’s central processing unit (CPU) or computer’s brain. In 2009, that was enough for mining Bitcoin as mining difficulty was very low.
GPU Mining
As Bitcoin started to catch people’s eyes, they started looking for more powerful mining solutions,

Learn more ways to spot and avoid Crypto scams, compiled by DroomDroom.

Then GPU mining came to light. A GPU ( Graphical processing unit ), or graphic card, is a unique component added to computers to carry out more complex calculations. Initially, GPUs were intended to allow gamers to run computer games with intense graphics requirements. But, because of their architecture, they became popular in cryptography, and around 2011, people also started using them to mine Bitcoins. They were more effective and faster at mining with better hash rates than CPUs.
For reference, the mining power of one GPU equals that of around 30 CPUs.
But they consumed much power and, because of high demand, have skyrocketed in price.
FPGA Mining
Another evolution came later on with FPGA mining.
FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is a piece of hardware that can be connected to a computer to run calculations. They are just like a GPU, but 3 to 100 times faster. But the downside is that they are more complex to configure, which is why, In 2013, a new type of miner was introduced, an ASIC miner.
ASIC Mining
Launched in 2012, ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit.
As miners now prefer custom mining machines for Bitcoin mining, ASIC is hardware manufactured solely for mining Bitcoin. Unlike GPUs, CPUs, and FPGAs, they are equipped with specialized chips to mine Bitcoin more efficiently and can’t be used to do anything else. They are hardcoded with functions into the machines and are the mining standard. Some Early ASIC miners even appeared in the form of USB, but they became obsolete rather quickly.
But ASIC rigs could be expensive, ranging from $2,000 to $15000.

Cloud Mining
This is the latest way to mint Bitcoin, where miners can buy a cloud mining service or contract from an existing cloud mining provider specializing in cryptocurrency mining rigs. While this gives the miner the advantage of mining Bitcoins without sunk and maintenance costs of mining hardware setup, one must be careful in choosing a reputed cloud miner to avoid future scams or fraud.

New to Cryptocurrency? What are the inevitable cryptocurrency scams that you’re likely to fall for? 

How Do You Start Bitcoin Mining
To Start Bitcoin mining, every miner needs basics, including

Mining hardware ( like Ebang, Antiminer),
Crypto Wallet, and
Knowledge of how to install and configure mining software.

Let’s look at each one them individually now:
Powerful Hardware Resources
Before a miner starts minting bitcoins, they need a powerful mining hardware setup designed specifically for mining cryptos and tools to solve complex puzzles efficiently. For efficient and effective mining, mining would require graphical processing units with advanced graphic cards, FPGAs( field programmable gate array ), or advanced ASICs (Application-specific integrated circuits ).
Since 2013, after the introduction of ASICs, ASICs-based hardware has been the most advanced and capable of generating the most hashes per second. However, at the same time, it’s costly, which may range in thousands of dollars.
Installing Mining Software
Besides powerful Hardware essentials, miners need to know how to install and configure the mining software ( like CG miner,  XMR miner ). Many of the software are free to download and work on Windows and Mac computers.
E-wallets
Then, a miner would also be required to create an e-wallet to store their rewards as Bitcoin. A Bitcoin wallet is a digital wallet that facilitates storing, accepting, and transferring Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.
Additionally, miners must possess advanced technical knowledge to operate hardware systems, improve the mining capacity, and monitor the progress.

Mining Pool or Solo Mining
Miners can choose between solo mining or opting for pool mining. With all the complexities of just starting up Bitcoin mining and going further, it takes work to do it, so mining pools were invented.
In mining pools, groups of miners are formed to face the increasing difficulty of mining together. Contrary to popular narrative, anyone with regular desktop computers or gaming systems can join the mining pools and mine. However, the returns are limited, as rewards are distributed among all the mining pool members according to how much work each miner has done.

Economics

Bitcoin mining is a business venture.

The three most significant factors that affect the cost of Bitcoin mining are electricity, network, and mining infrastructure.
Mining can result in substantial bills, given that electricity gives the power to run your mining systems 24/7. Mining systems produce much heat while mining, so these rigs need to be cooled, and the air conditioning is costly.
Mining alone can be hectic, so mining pools were introduced to reduce the complexity and difficulty miner faces during the mining. However, here, rewards are limited.
Network speeds do not affect significantly, but latency, i.e., time taken to communicate with the rest of the network, does.
So, for this venture to be profitable, the cost for these three inputs should be less than output ( bitcoin’s price ).
Rewards
What does one get for hustling and juggling so much through incurring the costs of such heavy infrastructure and energy usage?
In Bitcoin, the reward for successfully validating a block in Bitcoin’s network is free bitcoins and transaction fees ( a certain percentage of the transaction the miner inserted into the block).
Miner payment = block Reward + Transaction fees
However, since 2009 ( bitcoin launched ), the number of bitcoins each miner gets by validating each transaction is reduced by the Bitcoin halving phenomenon.
To know if you can do Bitcoin mining profitably, you can check it through the Profitability Calculator.
Bitcoin Halving
The reward for mining one block is halved every 210,000 blocks or about every four years. In 2009, when Bitcoin was launched, the reward for mining a block was 50 Bitcoins, then it was limited to 25 Bitcoins in 2012 and 12.5 in 2016. Bitcoin halving aims to cut down the Bitcoin’s inflation and circulation rate, stabilizing its value. The last Bitcoin halving event took place in May 2020.

When Bitcoin reaches its limit of 21 million, expected by 2140, miners will be constantly rewarded with fees for processing transactions that network users will pay. These fees are a way to ensure that miners validating the transactions still have the incentive to mine and keep the network going.
Issues
What is the probability of mining a Bitcoin block successfully through Pow?
It’s one in 57.6 trillion, with that scaling difficulty levels, a massive number of transactions being verified by users, and one block of transaction is verified roughly every 10 minutes. But remember, it’s a goal, not a rule.
Speed
With transactions logged in the Blockchain every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin network can currently process between 3 to 6 transactions per second. Whereas, in comparison, visa can process somewhere 65000 transactions per second. Upgrades and second-layer solutions have been addressed to the Bitcoin network for issues. However, there have yet to be any significant solutions./modern banking systems and other Blockchains dwarf the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle.
Scalability
The major problem at the core of Bitcoin protocol has been scaling. Though miners accept this as a core problem, there has yet to be much consensus about how to solve it.
Bitcoin has been introducing upgrades and accepting inputs from layers, but it still needs help with scalability.
Energy Usage
Energy usage has always been a topic of discussion worldwide, from Elon Musk to any average person expressing their opinions about what should and should not be done globally.
According to statistics, bitcoin mining alone consumes nearly 127 terawatt-hours (TWh) a year, more than many countries, including Norway. Bitcoin mining has always been an energy-intensive process. As the complexity and difficulty of Bitcoin mining rise, the computational power required to mine a Bitcoin also rises. 
However, many Bitcoin enthusiasts claim that Bitcoin runs on renewable energy sources only. Nevertheless, it is still a matter of debate as it’s self-reported data from mining pools, and the information provided is scarce and lacks transparency.

Conclusion
Bitcoin has always been the most popular cryptocurrency. While it seems very exciting to mint your Bitcoin, it comes with many complications and upfront costs. Additionally, its extreme price volatility makes it an unviable medium of exchange.
Bitcoin remains a speculative currency due to a lack of intrinsic value that operates in a decentralized and autonomous manner. 
Due to this, it’s invulnerable to regulations and law enforcement. Though, global leaders have addressed the impact and regulatory measures in G20 2023 meetings.

Bitcoin eyes $70k as the Piggy Bankster presale commences in 26 hours



                    

                    Key takeaways

Bitcoin is trading above $69k once again and is now targeting the $70k psychological level. 
The Piggy Bankster presale is commencing tomorrow ahead of its launch on the Solana blockchain.

Bitcoin targets $70k
The cryptocurrency market is having a positive start to the week, with BTC and other major altcoins performing well. At press time, the price of Bitcoin stands at $69,070, up by more than 1% in the last 24 hours.
With the broader market performing well so far, BTC could target the $70k psychological level in the near term. 
Piggy Bankster prepares for its presale
The cryptocurrency market has had an excellent run year-to-date, with most coins and tokens up by more than 50% during that period. As more investors troop into the market, exciting projects continue to emerge.
One project that is set to launch on the Solana blockchain soon is Piggy Bankster. Similar to other quality projects in the ecosystem, Piggy Bankster is offering investors the opportunity to purchase its $PIGS token at a discount via presale.
The Piggy Bankster presale will commence on June 4, 2024. According to the development team, the Piggy Bankster ($PIGS) launch is designed as a fair launch on the Solana network. This would allow investors to acquire the token from the outset.
Furthermore, the total supply of Piggy Bankster tokens is set at 100,000,000 $PIGS, with 100% of this supply being allocated to the liquidity pool. The memecoin’s initial liquidity stands at $12,000, with a starting price of $0.00012 per $PIGS. 
What is Piggy Bankster? The new Solana meme coin
With the Piggy Bankster presale just a few hours away, it is ideal to know more about this project. Piggy Bankster is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. However, while the meme coin space is dominated by Dog, Frog, and Cat characters like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Popcat, Piggy Bankster is introducing something fresh to the ecosystem.
It is a pig gangster-themed project represented by a pig nicknamed Piggy Bankster. According to their official website, Piggy Bankster struggled his way out of the slums of Swine City and reached the top of the criminal underworld.
Piggy Bankster is a crime boss who only appears on-chain donning a pin-striped suit. Piggy has, does, and will blast anyone in his way and is notorious for his ruthlessness. The pig values loyalty above all and looks after those who serve him faithfully.
Piggy Bankster’s launch comes at a time when meme coins are experiencing massive adoption in the crypto ecosystem. At the moment, there are seven meme coins in the top 100 list, including Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Book of Meme (BOME), Dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk, and Floki.
Solana has become home to some of the leading meme coins thanks to the network’s speed and transparency. Piggy Bankster is now looking to leverage Solana’s features for its $PIGS token. 
You can learn more about the Piggy Bankster project from their website or follow their social media activities on X and Telegram.

Peter Brandt Foresees “Moon Shot” For Bitcoin Price If This Happens ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Renowned market analyst Peter Brandt has predicted a significant upsurge in Bitcoin’s price should it breach a critical price barrier of around $150,000.



In a Sunday post, Brandt, known for his accurate forecasts, including the parabolic bull run of 2017, based his analysis on the historical symmetry observed around Bitcoin’s halving events, where mining rewards are cut in half.



Notably, these halvings have historically marked turning points for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. The pundit highlighted the mirroring effect between the pre-halving and post-halving periods, suggesting a potential peak for price in the fall for the next bull run.



“The number of weeks from the start of each bull market cycle (the low following a 75%-plus decline) to the Halving dates has been almost equal to the number of weeks from the Halving dates to the subsequent bull market highs, as shown on the chart herein. If this sequence continues, the next bull market cycle high should occur in late Aug/early Sep 2025” he wrote.



In terms of price targets, Brandt utilized an inverted parabolic curve to estimate potential highs, indicating a range of $130,000 to $150,000 for the upcoming bull cycle.

&nbsp







Commenting on the possibility of a “moon shot” scenario, Brandt highlighted the significance of breaching the key upper boundary. “If we blow through the top of the upper parabolic boundary,” he stated, “then BTC really does a moon shot.” 



Notably, Brandt’s latest forecast follows his recent prediction of a potential 230% surge for Bitcoin against Gold within the next 12-18 months. 



Other analysts are chiming in to add to the bullish sentiment. Ali Martinez observed that Bitcoin is currently hovering around a key price level, suggesting a potential rise if this support holds.



“Bitcoin is presently hovering around the +0.5σ pricing band at $66,800. Should $BTC sustain this level, it’s likely to ascend, testing the 1.0σ pricing band at $79,600.” Wrote Martinez.







Cryptoquant analyst Axel Adler also pointed to a rise in Bitcoin transfers to derivatives exchanges, indicating that large investors are positioning themselves for a potential bull market.



”An increase in the volume of transfers from major exchanges to derivatives exchanges indicates that large investors are taking on leveraged positions using Bitcoin as collateral, which increases the likelihood of a bullish market.”







Meanwhile, amidst these observations, Bitcoin opened strongly on Monday after bouncing off minor support at $67,470, following a relatively quiet period. The cryptocurrency traded at $69,404 at press time, marking a 2.23% increase over the past 24 hours. Its trading volume also saw a significant uptick, rising by 114% during the same period.



Notably, analysts from Into the Block attributed this surge to a substantial demand zone between $66,900 and $68,900, where over two million addresses have accumulated a total of 1.1 million BTC worth about $76.2 billion.

Matter Labs Abandons “ZK” Trademark Attempt Following Public Outcry - The Defiant

Matter Labs’ move to trademark the commonly-used acronym was met with condemnation from the web3 community.Matter Labs, the team behind the ZkSync Ethereum scaling solutions, has ceased efforts to trademark the term "ZK."On June 2, Matter Labs tweeted that it had decided to drop all trademark applications for the term ZK — a popular acronym referring to zero-knowledge cryptography.The move came after Matter Labs found itself at the center of controversy after seeking to trademark the term in nine different jurisdictions.“Thank you to everyone who reached out… offering ideas, support, and feedback,” Matter Labs tweeted on X. "As a result of these conversations, we decided to drop all trademark applications.”Matter Labs’ efforts to trademark ZK attracted fierce criticism from rival teams working with zero-knowledge cryptography, including Polygon, Starkware, and Polyhedra. They argued that leveraging the legal system to claim the popular and longstanding acronym violated the ethos of web3."We condemn this behavior in the strongest possible terms, as a transparent attempt by a corporation to claim ownership over something that does not belong to it," an open letter said. "ZK should remain a public good. It shouldn’t be a trademark of a corporation: it should rather be accessible to all."The projects also argued that Matter Labs was seeking to leverage the trademark to ensure its forthcoming token will trade under the ticker ZK — despite Polyhedra’s token already trading under that ticker.Matter Labs responded by claiming it wished to find a way to ensure the term “ZK” functioned as a public good while maintaining the trademark.“It would be impossible to agree on a group of people perceived as credibly neutral by nearly everyone,” the company said in its June 2 tweet. “What could have worked for Ethereum would not necessarily work for the entire world."The timing of the backlash comes as rumors are swirling that ZkSync will airdrop its long-awaited to users in mid-June.Speculation that the project would airdrop a token to early adopters ramped up when Matter Labs launched ZkSync Era, its zk-EVM network, in March 2023. The deployment took place within days of Arbitrum, the largest Layer 2 network by TVL, completing its ten-figure airdrop.ZkSync Era is now the ninth-largest Layer 2 network by total value locked (TVL), according to L2beat. Its DeFi ecosystem also boasts a TVL of $145 million, according to data from DefiLlama.

Binance delists the crypto WAVES: the price drops by 30%

This morning at 03:06 UTC the crypto exchange Binance announced the delisting from its platform of the coins WAVES, OMG, XEM, and WNXM, triggering a wave of negativity on their price.
WAVES in particular records a price variation of  -30% today, reaching -19% in the first hour following Binance’s announcement.
Let’s see all the details below.

Binance delists the crypto WAVES triggering a bear wave on the price
Today in the early hours of the morning the exchange Binance announced the delisting and the stop of technical support for the crypto WAVES, OMG, XEM, and WNXM, as part of its commitment to offering its clients the best investment options.
In fact, the platform periodically updates the coins available from its own spot and futures markets, given the highly dynamic and evolving environment of the cryptographic landscape.
In particular, the crypto mentioned will be officially removed starting from June 17, 2024, at 03:00  UTC.
The removed trading pairs are: OMG / USDT, WAVES / BTC, WAVES / ETH, WAVES / TRY, WAVES / USDT, WNXM / USDT, XEM / USDT.
It should be noted that the coins in question can be traded until the date set for the delisting, while all pending buy and sell orders will be removed after the cessation of trading.
Deposits made after June 18, 2024, at 03:00 UTC will no longer be credited, while withdrawals will no longer be supported from September 17, 2024, at 03:00 UTC, giving users 3 months to move their balances of removed tokens elsewhere.
It will still be possible to convert all funds in WAVES, XEM, OMG, and WNXM into stablecoin, even if the practice is not guaranteed by the same exchange, until September 18, 2024, at 03:00 UTC.

Immediately after the announcement, the crypto involved in the delisting recorded extremely negative price performance, with double-digit percentage declines.
in particular the token WAVES lost 30% of its value today, with a drop of 19% in the first hour of trading after the news conveyed by Binance.
The decline today opens up to a bearish price action from here to the coming months, with the future of the token now compromised by the exclusion of the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world.
The volumes of exchange are significant of the trend of WAVES holders to liquidate their holdings in the currency, which now reaches its lowest value in the last 8 months.
The crypto had recorded positive performance from October 2023 until March 2024, growing by about 200% before dropping drastically to the current levels.
From its all-time high, WAVES is down 97%.

Even OmiseGo (OMG) and Nem (XEM) have recorded predominantly bearish price trends with the former losing 27% in the last 24 hours and the latter losing 30% in the same time frame.
On the contrary, wappred NXM (WNXM) remains more or less stable, with its price having increased by 0.13% in the last 24 hours, and a drop of 5% since the announcement of the delisting from Binance.
The double face of altcoins: great gains in the face of great risks
As always, alternative coins (altcoin) like the crypto WAVES potentially offer great returns to their “investors”, but with a risk proportionate to the opportunity for profit.
Low-cap coins and with liquidity in the markets more scarce compared to the top market choices like Bitcoin and Ethereum are much easier to move in terms of prices, and can therefore be manipulated with less money.
To give an idea, in the last 24 hours the spot volumes of BTC amount to 20 billion dollars while those of WAVES (before the dump of -3%) amount to approximately 20 million dollars.
Understand well that the operation of a whale on the first coin does not particularly affect its price, while on the second it could have a much larger impact.
The majority of professionals in the cryptocurrency sector agree that altcoins, if you know how to ride the trend and take advantage of the right momentum, can allow you to bring home excellent gains.
In the long run, however, they are almost never a better solution than the king of the market BTC: precisely for this reason, they are often used as a speculative tool to accumulate more satoshi and increase one’s share of an asset that serves as a safe haven.
In the case of WAVES, we can observe how against BTC, between March and April 2022, the crypto registered an extreme pump of 500%, only to lose 90% in the 8 weeks following the peak.
Since that crash, WAVES has lost another 80% up to the present day, marking a total of -98% from the top of 2022.

Before investing in altcoin, make sure to choose the asset allocation that best suits your personal financial situation, without ever betting more than necessary on purely speculative assets like WAVES.

Dogecoin Co-Creator Blasts Crypto As A ‘Rigged Casino With Mostly Dumb People’ - Here’s Why ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
The co-founder of the most valuable jokes of all time has launched a scathing attack on cryptocurrency.



In a recent X post, Billy Markus, who alongside his Aussie colleague Jackson Palmer created the dog-themed meme token Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2013 as a joke to poke fun at the rampant speculation in crypto markets at the time, called the cryptoverse a rigged casino full of dumb people.



Dogecoin’s Billy Markus Takes Aim At Crypto



Billy Markus, popularly known in the crypto circles as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, has taken a swipe at the crypto ecosystem.



It all started when one of the most prolific NFT collectors and creators, Nate Alex, recently shared harsh criticism of the current state of the crypto market. In his X post, Alex posited that crypto presently “feels like a rigged casino,” adding that the key focus is onboarding clueless retail investors so that insiders can dump scam cryptocurrencies on them.



Dogecoin’s creator Markus concurred with Alex, describing the cryptosphere as a place where most people pretend to be smarter than they really are.

Nonetheless, the Nate is still heavily invested in the crypto market despite his critical remarks. He noted that 98% of his liquid capital is tied up in crypto and believes the market trend will continue to increase, at least for the rest of the year. 



Is The Crypto Market Rigged?



These kinds of statements about the crypto market being one big casino where the people in charge always win often get people riled up. 



However, in recent months, the crypto industry has witnessed a major reshuffling toward joke projects, with new meme coins such as Pepe (PEPE), BONK, and Dogwifhat (WIF) garnering traders’ attention, which has essentially paved the way for a meme cryptocurrency frenzy. Most of these coins have little utility and are often cited a proof the crypto market is rigged against the unaware crpto enthusisats.



For instance, the new Iggy Azalea memecoin, Mother Iggy (MOTHER), was reported to have “huge insider activity,” with one insider selling roughly 10% of the coin’s shortly after acquiring them in an over-the-counter deal. Caitlyn Jenner, rappers Soulja Boy and Rich The Kid, and adult-content models Kazumi and Ivana Knöll have also launched tokens recently, which have netted early buyers, in some cases, quick eight-figure profits.



Amid the froth, fundamental and older crypto ventures are attracting less attention, and their values during this cycle have not seen face-melting rallies. Even OG meme crypto DOGE has not enjoyed a massive upsurge of interest and subsequent growth in price, as all attention has shifted from it to the slew of newer meme coins.



Those looking to get rich overnight sure do feel like the crypto market is a casino where the house always wins. However, the crypto market always works for patient investors with a long enough time horizon, ignoring meaningless short-term performance figures.

First Mover Americas: Crypto Prices Tick Upward as Meme Coin Season Receives Fresh Impetus

Bitcoin kicked off the week by reclaiming $69,000 as crypto assets ticked up across the board during the European morning. BTC is priced around $69,200 at the time of writing, an increase of about 2.5% in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), rose 1.4%. Dogecoin led the gains, trading just under 3% higher, after influential retail investor Keith Gill disclosed a $180 million position in Gamestop, sending GME up around 80% in pre-market trading. Meme stock surges are often seen as a bullish indicator for meme coins such as DOGE. A Solana-based GME meme coin has rocketed over 200% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The price of GameStop's GME meme coin on the Solana blockchain has seen an astonishing increase of over 300% in the last 24 hours. While the exact reason for the rise remains speculative, the huge gain coincides with a recent post made by a key figure in the world of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies: Keith Gill, better known as "Roaring Kitty."Gill, most known for his role in the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, has once again become the catalyst for a significant price movement for GME tokens. His recent post on social media seems to have sparked a buying frenzy for GME. In Monday's early trading,  GME surged from lows of $0.0038 to intraday highs of $0.015, increasing its price by nearly fivefold. GME coin on Solana is a meme token paying tribute to the 2021 short squeeze of GameStop.At the time of writing, GME is trading at around $0.0127, up 225% in the last 24 hours. Trading volumes have also surged significantly within the said time frame, rising 1,292% to over $271.8 million, signaling a rise in market activity.The surge in trading volumes comes as traders seek to capture gains amid the massive price jump. On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain reports one such move by a "smart trader," who often buys GME at low prices and sells at highs.After the massive surge in the GME price, the smart trader sold 3.5 million GME at $0.01226 for 260 SOL, or $43,000. The trader still holds 108 million GME worth $1.5 million with a total profit of about $1.37 million, obviously waiting for the next big price move for GME.On May 13, Gill began posting again roughly three years after the events surrounding the GameStop case and the shutdown of the WallStreetBets subreddit. The impact of his return was immediate and profound, with the value of GME meme coin on Solana soaring subsequently.Notably, GME has rallied 2,118% in the last 30 days and is up 240% in the last seven days, per CoinGecko data.

Trader blames ‘slow’ Binance after losing millions to fake Google plugin


A Chinese trader claims that Binance ignored “extremely abnormal transactions” and failed to freeze funds belonging to an “obvious hacker,” leading to them losing their $1 million life savings via a promotional Google plugin.
The trader, who goes by the name ‘CryptoNakamao’ on social media, reportedly used the Aggr plugin to access trading data. However, it actually allowed hackers to find a way around password and two-factor authentication (2FA) protection to gain access to their Binance account.
Once into their account, CryptoNakamao explains that the hacker bought several tokens in the Tether trading pair — which had abundant liquidity – and placed sell orders in Bitcoin, USD Coin, and other trading pairs — which had scarce liquidity.
Then, despite not being able to withdraw funds directly, the hacker was able to open leveraged positions, buy a large amount in excess, and complete their cross-trading.
The trader says they noticed their account trading randomly on May 24 but by the time they got in touch with Binance, it had been drained.
“Throughout the process, the response of Binance staff was very slow and they did not help users recover any losses,” they wrote on X (formerly Twitter).
“Seeing that the exchange interception had completely failed, I sought help from a security company to see if the hacker could be locked down.”

Binance knew about the plugin and the hacker’s address
During the course of the investigation, CryptoNakamao claims that, not only had Binance known about the plugin and the nature of the pilot for some time, but it had also received complaints, and had even “tracked down the hacker’s address at least three or four weeks ago.”
Despite this, it still failed to take any action.
Taking to X (formerly Twitter) to vent, CryptoNakamao said:
“Binance knew about the problems with the hacker and the plug-in, but did nothing for several weeks, allowing the promotion to continue, resulting in greater financial losses.
“Hackers manipulated accounts for more than an hour, causing extremely abnormal transactions in multiple currency pairs without any risk control.
“Binance failed to freeze the funds of the obvious hacker’s single account in the platform in a timely manner and it took more than a day before Binance contacted the relevant platform to freeze the transaction.”

Europol raids money mules who laundered $10M for crypto scammers


Authorities from Italy, Portugal, and Europol have carried out raids against two money mule recruiting networks allegedly working for crypto scammers police said lacked the expertise to launder over €10 million ($10.8 million).
Between May 21 and 27, Police raided properties across France, Italy, and Romania, detaining 11 suspects and the alleged mastermind behind the money laundering scheme. Fifteen house searches also seized crypto, jewelry, and electronic devices.
The money mule networks worked for an organized crime group that makes its crypto through ‘rip-deal’ scams. These operations see scammers targeting millionaires interested in property by pretending to be part of an international investment fund.
Europol said, “The criminals contacted the victims, scheduled an appointment at luxury restaurants or hotels, and instructed them to download applications to manage cryptocurrencies. As soon as the victims installed the app, the criminals used sophisticated technical tools to take control of the crypto wallets.” 

Read more: Another Chinese money laundering scheme tied to Deltec and Tether
Police discovered the mule networks after tracking the scammers’ crypto. Criminals pay money mules a commission to receive their funds and transfer them to an account controlled by another third party.
Europol claims the main perpetrators of the rip-deal crypto scams ‘lacked the technical expertise’ to launder their profits, which exceeded €10 million ($10.8 million), and reached out to the money mule networks for help. 
Money mules have become enough of a problem that Europol has rolled out its own #DontBeaMule campaign to help raise awareness about their use.

Will Toncoin (TON) Succeed in Breaching $7?


Toncoin’s (TON) price has been struggling to close above a critical resistance level that may change with the emergence of Notcoin.
The investors favoring a rise over profit-taking could substantiate the uptrend TON notices.
Toncoin Is Safe From a Fall.

Toncoin’s price has benefited from the recent bullishness surrounding Notcoin (NOT). NOT is the native token of a web3 game on the Toncoin blockchain. The altcoin has surged by more than 220% in the past week, which has also instilled optimism of a rally among TON holders.
The market is positive towards a rise, with Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) pointing in the same direction. The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of an asset’s price, helping identify potential buy and sell signals. 
It consists of the MACD line, the signal line, and a histogram to gauge market direction and momentum.
This indicator is at the cusp of a bullish crossover, which signifies a further rise is likely. Once the bars on the histogram turn green, this potential will be confirmed.

Secondly, optimism also comes from TON holders’ lack of potential profit-taking. Upon observing the active addresses by profitability, it can be noted that less than 19% of the participating investors are currently profitable.

Investors in profit conducting transactions on the network tend to do so with the intention of securing their gains. However, since they are not dominating the network, any damage they could do is minimized.
TON Price Prediction: $7 Is in the Sights Again

A rally is on the cards if Toncoin’s price follows the aforementioned path. With TON changing hands at $6.6 at the time of writing, it could breach the barrier of $7.0. This resistance has kept the altcoin below it for weeks now.
A breakout could trigger bullishness across the market, pushing the price upwards. At the moment, $7.6 marks the all-time high, and if the optimism remains intact, Toncoin’s price could form a new ATH above $7.6.

However, if the breach of $7.0 fails again, TON will lose this bullishness. While the next major support is at $6.5, Toncoin’s price has never stayed above it, making the altcoin vulnerable to a dip below. As a result, the bullish thesis will be invalidated.

Bitcoin's $69K Test: Will the King Hold or Will Altcoins Take the Crown?


							

Bitcoin nears $69,330 resistance, consistent closing above may push price to $74,400, attracting trader interest.



Altcoins outperform Bitcoin, signaling potential for higher returns and prompting investors to consider portfolio diversification.



Market reaction to Bitcoin’s resistance test will shape the short-term direction of the cryptocurrency landscape.




As Bitcoin approaches a major resistance level, the cryptocurrency industry could face serious repercussions. With a price of $68,909.66, Bitcoin has gained 0.45% in the past week and 2.11% in the last day. Analysts are closely monitoring Bitcoin’s movement as it nears the $69,330 resistance level.



Ali, a crypto analyst, highlighted the symmetrical triangle breakout pattern in Bitcoin. Ali suggested that a consistent closing over the $69,330 barrier could push Bitcoin above $74,400. Traders and investors are closely watching this development and are hoping that a breach of the resistance level would lead to a possible rally.







Michaël van de Poppe, stated that Bitcoin needs to break above $70,000 in order to rally. While Bitcoin’s price volatility is notable, altcoins are performing better, according to Van de Poppe. Given this pattern, investors may want to consider diversifying their portfolios, as the current market cycle may be favoring altcoins.







With a trade volume of $23,801,034,539.64, Bitcoin demonstrates a strong market. Bitcoin’s recent price increase has spurred interest, but altcoins are also gaining more attention. In the present market conditions, many cryptocurrencies are experiencing notable breakouts, attracting investors seeking bigger returns.



A crucial sign of Bitcoin’s capability to hit new highs will be its ability to maintain its upward trend and overcome the $69,330 barrier. However, the stronger performance of altcoins points to a wider trend in the market that may affect investment approaches.



These latest events highlight the ever-changing character of digital assets, and the cryptocurrency industry is notorious for its volatility. For Bitcoin, the near-term outlook will mostly depend on its present price and how it approaches the crucial resistance level. The bitcoin ecosystem as a whole will be impacted by the market’s reaction to its performance.



Market movement is expected as Bitcoin approaches the $69,330 resistance level. Analysts and investors are watching for signs of sustained momentum that could lead to higher price targets. The outcome of this price movement will most likely dictate the course that the cryptocurrency market takes in the coming weeks.



On the other hand, many altcoins are already exhibiting signs of strength and attracting interest from investors. This pattern may indicate a time when altcoins surpass Bitcoin in value, offering chances for investors looking to take advantage of the changing nature of the market.

Dogecoin Whales Are Disappearing? What's Happening With DOGE

Dogecoin on-chain data suggests that whales are slowly abandoning their positions and distancing away from the beloved meme coin. Unfortunately, there is the possibility of a further breakdown for DOGE, especially without the much needed support of larger investors. Regretfully, DOGE may experience additional breakdowns particularly in the absence of the crucial backing from bigger investors. The current state of affairs is better illustrated by recent data and charts. There has been a discernible decrease in the quantity of large transactions. By June 2, there were only 718 transactions, down from a seven-day high of 54,000 on May 27. Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewThis pattern suggests a notable decline in whale activity, which may have a substantial impact on Dogecoin's value and stability. A similar pattern emerges when one looks at the volume of large transactions. A seven-day high of 8.65 billion DOGE on May 29 was followed by a precipitous decline in volume to 4. 6 billion DOGE by June 2. Large investors who have historically been crucial in maintaining and influencing the price of sentiment-driven cryptocurrencies are showing signs of waning interest, as seen in the decline. These on-chain measurements are shown in the DOGE/USDT chart. The price has been having difficulty staying above the important moving averages.That is not to mention the RSI, which indicates a reading close to 50. The neutrality of this momentum oscillator also suggests that Dogecoin is unlikely to see a volatility surge, hence the lack of interesting moves.Significant trading volume is typically needed to validate long-term price increases. Worries about a possible collapse in DOGE's price are heightened by the current lack of noteworthy volume.

Billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya on Why He Is So Bullish on Bitcoin | Cryptoglobe


                                
Billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya recently discussed the potential for countries to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) alongside their local currencies. 



Chamath Palihapitiya is a Canadian-American venture capitalist, engineer, and the founder and CEO of Social Capital, a venture capital firm that invests in companies across various sectors including technology, healthcare, and education. Born in Sri Lanka in 1976, Palihapitiya moved to Canada with his family as a refugee. He graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Waterloo.



Palihapitiya’s career began at AOL, where he eventually became the youngest vice president in the company’s history. He later joined Facebook in 2007, where he played a significant role in expanding the social media giant’s user base and business operations, serving as the vice president of user growth. His tenure at Facebook significantly boosted his profile in Silicon Valley.



After leaving Facebook in 2011, Palihapitiya founded Social Capital with the goal of funding and mentoring innovative companies. Under his leadership, Social Capital has invested in a wide array of successful startups, including Slack, Yammer, and Box. Palihapitiya is known for his outspoken views on technology, investing, and social issues, often sharing his thoughts through various media platforms and speaking engagements.



In addition to his venture capital activities, Palihapitiya has made headlines through his involvement with SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies), using them to take companies like Virgin Galactic public. He is also known for his philanthropy, particularly in areas related to education and scientific research.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

In the episode of the All-In Podcast that was released on May 31, Palihapitiya shared insights from his conversation with Wences Casares, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who introduced him to Bitcoin back in 2010, when the cryptocurrency was trading at around $80.



Palihapitiya recounted a compelling concept presented by Casares, suggesting a path for the mass adoption of Bitcoin. According to Casares, while some countries may never fully endorse Bitcoin, there is a growing number that might adopt a dual-currency system. These countries would use their local currency for everyday transactions and Bitcoin for purchasing permanent assets with lasting value. Palihapitiya highlighted this dual-currency approach as a powerful idea, especially for countries grappling with economic instability.



In their discussion, Casares urged Palihapitiya to examine Bitcoin’s performance following its halving events, which cut miners’ rewards in half. Historical data suggests that Bitcoin’s price tends to surge significantly after each halving. Palihapitiya shared a chart predicting that Bitcoin could soar to nearly $500,000 by October 2025 if it follows the same pattern observed in previous market cycles.







Palihapitiya elaborated on the potential for Bitcoin to replace gold as a store of value. He suggested that if Bitcoin reaches the predicted levels of appreciation, it could surpass gold and become a preferred asset for transactions involving hard assets. This scenario becomes even more plausible when considering concerns about the debasement of the U.S. dollar. Palihapitiya believes that such economic conditions could create significant opportunities for Bitcoin.

Australia: tomorrow the first crypto spot ETF arrives

Tomorrow, Tuesday, June 4, 2024, the first crypto spot ETF in Australia will debut on the stock exchange. 
It is the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) by Monochrome, and it will be in all respects a spot Bitcoin ETF. 
It will be tradable on the local exchange Cboe Australia.

IBTC: the first crypto spot ETF in Australia
IBTC is in all respects the first crypto spot ETF to be launched on an Australian exchange. 
It is a fund entirely invested in BTC that allows taking a position directly on the price of Bitcoin on Cboe Australia.
In reality, the fund has already existed since March of last year, but only tomorrow will it debut on the stock exchange. 
A year ago the price of IBTC was only 3 Australian dollars (AUD), while now it has risen to over 10$. This performance obviously follows that of the price of Bitcoin, which in the same period went from 36,000 AUD to almost 103,000.
It should be remembered that one Australian dollar today is worth about 0.67$, so its current quotation of 10.3 AUD actually corresponds to about 6.8 American dollars. 
Currently, it appears to have already issued more than 170,000 shares, with a total NAV exceeding 1.7 million Australian dollars. 
Monochrome is an Asset Management company specialized in offering regulated derivative products on crypto assets. For now, however, it has only released a single product on the market, IBTC to be precise. 
Australia: the Cboe Exchange welcomes the first crypto ETF
The main traditional stock exchange in Australia is the Australian Securities Exchange (XASX) in Sydney. 
It is one of the top 25 stock exchanges in the world, but it has a total market cap of only about 2.6 trillion dollars, which is just slightly less than that of the single Nvidia stock. 
Cboe Australia, on the other hand, is a subsidiary of the better-known Cboe in the United States that operates specifically in Australia. 
This stock exchange specializes in ETFs rather than stocks, and in fact, it claims to have a market share of even 30% of the entire Australian ETF market. 
Previously it was known as Chi-X, and it was launched in October 2011, which is less than 13 years ago. In June 2021, it was acquired by Cboe Global Markets and renamed. 
In light of this, it is very difficult to imagine that tomorrow’s listing could have significant effects on the price of Bitcoin.
The other ETFs
In reality, on the Australian stock exchanges, there were already some crypto ETFs. 
However, it was not about spot ETFs, but funds that held BTC only indirectly, for example through offshore products. The problem is that in this way they did not benefit from the investor protection rules provided by the Australian Financial Services Licensing (AFSL) licensing regime. 
Instead, IBTC will provide the first ETF available on Australian exchanges to hold the entire underlying directly in BTC. 
Obviously, by directly holding BTC, the risks related to custody increase, but nowadays there are very reliable institutional-level custody services. 
In fact, Monochrome has chosen Gemini Trust Company as the custodian of the fund’s BTC, the American company specialized in the custody of crypto assets linked to the Gemini exchange. 
Only thanks to this institutional-level custodian was it able to offer the Australian stock exchange a spot Bitcoin ETF. 
It should be noted that even in the USA until last year there were only ETFs on BTC derivative products, such as futures, and until the arrival on the stock exchange of spot Bitcoin ETFs, these derivative products had not been very successful.
Instead, in Canada, where there was already one (BTCC.TO), this had achieved greater success, precisely because it was directly and entirely collateralized in BTC.
In fact, as of today, BTCC.TO remains by far the largest Bitcoin ETF in the world after the big 5 Americans. 
The rest of the world
In Europe, for years now, there have been spot crypto ETFs or similar, especially on the Swiss exchanges. 
In the USA, those on Bitcoin landed on the stock exchange this year, and in the coming weeks, those on Ethereum should also arrive. 
Even on Chinese stock exchanges, there are already ETFs on BTC and ETH spot, but only on the international one in Hong Kong, and not on the Shanghai one aimed at the domestic market. 
The most important market remains absolutely the US one, followed in this case by the Canadian one of the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
There are then the European markets, such as the German one and the English one, but especially the Swiss one. Also in Brazil and Sweden, there are similar products, while in other markets, such as the Japanese one, there do not appear to be any spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
In other words, the main markets are only two: the North American one and the European one. For now, in the rest of the world, these products are either totally absent from traditional exchanges, or present in an extremely limited measure.

Fraudulent Plugin Hits Binance User for $1 Million


                                Hacker Scam Exposes Binance Trading Flaws, Trader Losses $1 Million                                A Chinese trader who trades under the pseudonym CryptoNakamao was defrauded of $1 million after falling for a hacking scam that involved a fake Google Chrome plugin called Aggr. This scam shows that there are critical flaws in the security of online trading and questions the liability of trading platforms to customers.What's the News?On May 24, CryptoNakamao realized the strange trading activities in his Binance account. At first, he was not sure what had happened but he later discovered that through the Aggr plugin hackers had stolen his web browser cookie data. This plugin, which was advertised as a program to display information about popular traders, was a virus that aimed at capturing users’ web activity and cookies.From the stolen cookies, the hackers were able to overcome the basic security measures of passwords and 2 Factor Authentication to take over users’ sessions. They engaged in multiple leveraged trades in which they used low liquidity pairs to control the price and make profits from the trades.Although they could not withdraw the funds directly because of the 2 Factor Authentication, the hacker remained active through the compromised sessions and performed cross-trading operations. They used high liquidity tokens and posted sell orders at artificially high prices in pairs with low liquidity, and then they earned good money this way.Who is at Fault: The Trader or Binance?CryptoNakamao accuses Binance of not having implemented basic security features and of ignoring his complaints. The trader stated that Binance had knowledge of the fraudulent plugin and was conducting an internal investigation but failed to notify the users or prevent it. He accused Binance of not freezing the hacker’s account when they saw that there was unusual trading activity and transactions. This failure to act promptly enabled the hackers to wreak havoc on the platform for more than an hour and cost the company a lot of money.The $1 million scam highlights critical security flaws. This incident has raised concerns over the liability of trading platforms like Binance in protecting users. The breach has undermined trust in online trading, potentially deterring new investors and prompting existing ones to reevaluate their security measures. Binance faces scrutiny for its delayed response and lack of proactive measures, which may damage its reputation and lead to tighter regulations. Overall, this Crypto scam emphasizes the urgent need for enhanced security protocols to safeguard user assets in the crypto market.ConclusionAs per CoinGabbar, this incident underscores the importance of robust security measures and prompt action by trading platforms to protect their users. While the trader's installation of a malicious plugin initiated the breach, the responsibility also lies with Binance for not effectively monitoring and responding to suspicious activities. This event serves as a cautionary tale for traders to be vigilant about the tools they use and for platforms to enhance their security protocols to prevent such scams in the future.Also Read: Spot Ether ETF In the Limelight As Fee Announced

Machine learning algorithm predicts Bitcoin price for June 30, 2024


    Although Bitcoin (BTC) has been dragging its feet lately, the prospects of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset look promising, particularly as machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms predict advances for the popular cryptocurrency in the near future.



As it happens, Bitcoin last week bounced from the $70,000 level and has been trading beneath it for the majority of the time since, but its more recent movements demonstrate signs of recovery, as the largest crypto asset by market capitalization moves closer to retaking this critical psychological level.



BTC price prediction



In terms of its performance in the following weeks, Bitcoin could overtake this important price mark and continue to grow further, potentially hitting $75,245.53 by June 30, 2024, according to the advanced algorithms deployed by the crypto analytics and forecasting platform PricePredictions retrieved on June 3.

In other words, Bitcoin might advance by 9.02% from its current price provided that the algorithm’s prediction, which relies on technical analysis (TA) indicators like relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and others, comes true.



Bitcoin price history



For the time being, the number one asset in the crypto market is trading at $69,020, suggesting an increase of 2.38% on the day, gaining 0.70% across the past week, and accumulating growth of 9.26% in the last month, as well as advancing 60.51% since the year’s turn.

Elsewhere, popular crypto trading expert Ali Martinez has recently observed that Bitcoin was hovering “around the +0.5σ pricing band at $66,800” and that if it could hold above it, “BTC will likely rise to test the 1.0σ pricing band at $79,600,” according to the analysis he shared in an X post on June 2.

Earlier, pseudonymous crypto analyst Rekt Capital shared his view that Bitcoin, indeed, had room for a breakout as long as it clears the key price levels of $70,000 and $71,600, which have repeatedly capped its attempts to rally, establishing themselves as significant barriers.







All things considered, Bitcoin prediction 2024 looks optimistic, taking into account the projections by both machine algorithms and crypto analysts. However, trends in the cryptoverse can easily change, so it is important to do one’s own research when investing larger amounts of money.

The Magnificent Return of the GameStop Phenomenon to the Markets: These Altcoins Have Taken Flight! - Bitcoin Sistemi

In early May, stock trader and analyst Keith Gill, known on social media as “The Roaring Kitty” and who largely fueled the GameStop frenzy in late 2020, signaled his return to the markets after three years of silence.

Roaring Kitty returned to Reddit after more than three years and fueled the rise in some altcoins.


Sharing on Reddit, Gill shared a $181.4 million GameStop (GME) position, leading to a significant increase in the GME stock price.
Gill's post also caused an increase in some altcoins. Meme tokens named GME, ROAR and KITTY experienced a huge jump after Gill's post, and according to the data, they increased by up to 315%, 840% and 500% respectively.





At the time of writing, GME is $0.0129; KITTY continues to trade at $0.0144 and ROAR at $0.0018.
After these increases, an investor sold 3.5 million GME at $0.01226 for 260 SOL ($43 thousand).


According to Lookonchain, this investor, who is good at buying GME low and selling it high, still has $1.5 million worth of GME in his hands.

“Since TheRoaringKitty returned, GME 's Solana price is up more than 300%.
This smart investor's limit order was triggered and sold for 3.5 million GME 260 SOL ($43k) at $0.01226.
This smart trader is good at buying GME low and selling high!
“He still has 108 million GME ($1.5 million) on hand and his total profit is approximately $1.37 million.”

Bitcoin Price Stable at $69K Amid Strong Demand Zone Bolstered By 1.1M BTC


																The $70,000 level continues to be a major hurdle for bitcoin, but the latest data suggest that the world’s largest digital asset remains stable at the current price level and could initiate another leg up soon.
According to the latest analysis by IntoTheBlock, BTC has maintained a stable price of around $69,000, primarily due to a robust demand zone between $66,900 and $68,900.
The range in question is particularly noteworthy as it includes over two million addresses that have collectively accumulated a substantial 1.1 million BTC.
The data shows that the concentration of buying activity is indicative of a high level of interest and engagement among traders, creating a strong support level that has helped bitcoin sustain its current valuation despite market fluctuations.
This significant demand zone acts as a critical buffer, indicating trader confidence and investment at these price levels.




“Bitcoin remains steady around $69k, thanks to a significant demand zone between $66.9k and $68.9k. In this range, over two million addresses have accumulated a total of 1.1 million BTC, highlighting a significant level of interest and activity among traders.”
The overall investor sentiment appears to be bullish, with renowned crypto trader Peter Brandt predicting that bitcoin’s current bull run could peak between $130,000 and $150,000 by late August to early September 2025, based on historical patterns following BTC’s previous halving events.
The bullish momentum is also driven by significant developments in the bitcoin ecosystem.
US Senator Ted Cruz, a longtime crypto supporter, has initiated mining operations in Iraan, Texas, by purchasing three application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) Bitcoin miners.
Additionally, the Republic of Tatarstan, also known as Tataria, is aiming to establish Russia’s largest Bitcoin mining company, valued at approximately $100 million.

Shiba Inu Begins New Week On A Negative Note As Burn Rate Crashes 97% With Only Two Transactions | Bitcoinist.com


								The Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate has significantly declined to begin the new week. The drop in the number of Shiba Inu tokens burned continues to be an issue for the meme coin’s ecosystem, and certain factors contribute to this decline. 
SHIB’s Burn Rate Declines By 97%
Data from the burn tracking website Shibburn shows that Shiba Inu’s burn rate has declined by over 97% in the last 24 hours, with only 128,791 SHIB tokens burned during this period. These burns occurred in just two transactions, with 100,000 Shiba Inu tokens burned in one transaction and 28,791 burned in the second transaction. 

This is in stark contrast to the day before when over 4.5 million SHIB tokens were burned. However, the bigger picture shows that Shiba Inu’s burn rate has been on the decline for a while now. Further data from Shibburn shows that there has been an almost 40% drop in the meme coin’s burn rate in the last seven days. 
Meanwhile, SHIB also witnessed a 78.23% drop in the monthly burn rate in May. Over 369 million tokens were burned in May, which was still relatively low compared to how much was burned in April. 
Source: Shibburn
This decline has been partly thanks to the layer-2 network Shibarium, which has experienced a significant drop in its daily transactions. The network is known to have contributed significantly to the SHIB burns that were carried out in the past, with over 33.8 billion Shiba Inu tokens burned in December last year, thanks to Shibarium.  
However, in recent times, Shibarium has failed to execute SHIB token burns, most likely because the transaction fees earned from these daily transactions aren’t sufficient to consider delegating some to token burns. 
Significance Of The Shiba Inu Token Burns 
These Shiba Inu token burns significantly impact the meme coin’s price, especially when complemented by increased demand for SHIB. Furthermore, the token burns are critical at a time like this when the bull run is about to kickstart in full force. 
Shiba Inu is expected to witness an impressive demand, considering that meme coins are one of the leading narratives in this cycle. Therefore, burning these SHIB tokens on a large could help the meme coin’s price skyrocket to new highs. 

Meanwhile, given that SHIB still has a circulating supply of over 589 trillion, these token burns are deemed necessary if the meme coin is ever to reach certain heights. Shiba Inu’s burn tracker has noted that Shiba Inu’s maximum circulating supply has to be pegged at just 134 trillion if the meme coin is to reach $0.01. 
At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00002472, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Monochrome's Spot Bitcoin ETF to Debut in Australia


Monochrome Asset Management is set to make history with the launch of Australia’s first spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds Bitcoin directly. The Monochrome Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) will begin trading on the Cboe Australia exchange on Tuesday, June 4, 2024, at 10:00 AEST (00:00 UTC).
This marks a significant milestone for the Australian crypto market. It also offers investors a regulated and transparent way to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin.
Direct Bitcoin Holdings: Monochrome’s ETF Debut

The introduction of IBTC addresses a gap in the market. This product is the first and currently the only ETF that holds Bitcoin directly in Australia.
Australia has two exchange-traded products on Cboe Australia that provide exposure to spot crypto assets. However, they do not hold Bitcoin directly.

“Before IBTC, Australian investors were only able to invest in ETFs that indirectly hold Bitcoin or through offshore Bitcoin products, both of which don’t benefit from the investor protection rules under the directly held crypto asset AFS licensing regime,” Monochrome said in a statement.

In March, Monochrome announced that IBTC would be the first to use the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate—Asia Pacific Variant (BRRAP) for its benchmarking. The BRRAP provides a reliable pricing benchmark for Bitcoin.

It is designed to accurately reflect the market price, resist manipulation, and be verifiable by market participants. Additionally, Monochrome partners with crypto exchange Gemini as its Bitcoin custodian.
The company applied for a spot in Bitcoin ETF in April 2024. In Australia, firms require the approval of the regulator, the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC), and then the exchange listing the product, in this case, Cboe Australia. Monochrome had already won approval from ASIC for this product.
Monochrome’s IBTC launch came after ASX Ltd., Australia’s primary securities exchange, reportedly considered approving its first spot Bitcoin ETFs. Sources close to the matter suggest that these approvals could materialize before the end of 2024.
BeInCrypto previously reported that BetaShares is actively working towards launching its product on the ASX. A company spokesperson shared that they have already reserved ticker symbols for their spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.
Similarly, DigitalX Ltd., another Australian firm, disclosed in its half-year results that it has applied. At the same time, VanEck, a veteran in the ETF sphere with US and European products, reentered the Australian fray. The company submitted a renewed application earlier this year.

This marks the second wave of spot Bitcoin ETF launches in Australia. Sydney-based Cosmos Asset Management launched a spot Bitcoin ETF in 2022 but delisted the fund later that year after tepid inflows. However, with the buzz from spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and Hong Kong, these products could potentially stay in the Australian market.

Australia’s pension system, valued at $2.5 trillion, has also shown growing interest in cryptocurrencies. The country’s pension funds have allocated approximately 1 billion Australian dollars ($664 million) to digital assets. If Australian pension funds follow the lead of their US counterparts to hold spot Bitcoin ETFs, this could strengthen the foundations for these products in the Australian market.

'There's Enough Money': Cardano Creator Calms Down ADA Community


In a recent post, Cardano's creator, Charles Hoskinson, addressed concerns about the blockchain's scalability. He highlighted the availability of sufficient funds in the treasury to support an ambitious Leios, Hydra and ZK program if the community chooses to pursue it.Hoskinson also highlighted the potential for a parallel approach, citing the existing infrastructure and talent within the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem. He expressed optimism about the potential for rapid progress, citing the substantial enhancements witnessed over the past two years.The Cardano community has been engaged in discussions regarding scalability, particularly in light of the blockchain's growing competition, including platforms like Solana and Ethereum. The CTO of Sundae Labs, a prominent ADA enthusiast, supported a debate by rooting for Leios, a novel design for Cardano's data computation algorithm. Another noteworthy innovation is Hydra, a layer-2 scaling solution. By creating a network of parallel processing nodes, Hydra seeks to boost transaction throughput and minimize latency on the blockchain. This initiative promises to elevate Cardano's capacity to handle a higher volume of transactions while maintaining security and decentralization.Community's opinionFollowing Hoskinson's remarks, numerous contributors and developers within the Cardano ecosystem weighed in on the matter. Some expressed enthusiasm for scalability, while cautioning against depleting the treasury too rapidly as it could affect ADA's price.All in all, the sentiment among many in the community echoed a desire for scalable solutions that would enable applications to perform optimally. What is more important is that while acknowledging the current challenges, there was collective optimism regarding the ongoing improvements within the ecosystem.

Buy alert: Bitcoin technical analysis hints at BTC surge toward $75,000


    Given its position as the world’s premier cryptocurrency and its sheer market capitalization, Bitcoin (BTC) has always served, to an extent, as the microcosm of the broader crypto market.



At the very start of June 2024, this does not only still appear true but also looks as though it has expanded as BTC is, at the time of publication, apparently poised both for a deeper crash and a significant surge after a period of relative stagnation and sideways trading.



Indeed, such a sense of a simultaneous boom and bust can be seen across different assets, with the overall economy in a paradoxical state in which fears of a crash are running rampant while most forecasts are remaining very bullish.







When it comes to Bitcoin, at least, technical analysis may finally be able to see past the obstacles and help investors discern what the world’s premier cryptocurrency will do next.



Bitcoin set for a significant surge



Following a sharp rise in the first months of 2024, Bitcoin entered a period of protracted sideways trading – albeit marked by substantial volatility and swings in the range between approximately $59,000 and about $71,000.



Indeed, while BTC is 60.51% in the green year-to-date, it rose a mere 9.41% in the last 30 days and 0.41% in the last 7. Additionally, Bitcoin price today stands at $70,017, though the day’s trading has already featured substantial volatility.



BTC YTD price chart. Source: Finbold



On June 3, however, BTC appears set to break out of a symmetrical triangle chart pattern it has formed, per the analysis conducted by the prominent crypto expert on X, Ali Martinez.



According to Martinez, should Bitcoin sustain a price above $69,330, it is likely the coin will shoot up as high as $74,400.



Bitcoin symmetrical triangle with the estimated breakout. Source: @ali_charts



Highlighting the uncertainty of the broader market, however, the hints at an imminent breakout stemming from the symmetrical triangle come at the same time as a strong signal issued by a technical indicator called TD Sequential.



Indeed, this indicator – made to estimate whether the current trend is set to be confirmed or reversed based on historical price movements – demonstrates that Bitcoin is, in fact, set to enter a correction toward either $68,700 or $68,050, again per Ali Martinez’s analysis.

The crypto expert, however, pointed out that despite the sell signal issued by TD Sequential, it remains likely that should Bitcoin remain consistently above the crucial resistance level at $69,300, a bullish breakout remains likely for BTC.

Bitcoin Flashing Signal That Foreshadowed Massive Stock Market Rally in 1980s, According to Trader Peter Brandt - The Daily Hodl


								Legendary trader Peter Brandt says one Bitcoin (BTC) chart looks quite similar to the one printed by the stock market in the mid-1980s before a big breakout.
Brandt tells his followers on the social media platform X that he’s looking at Bitcoin versus the M1 money supply chart (BTC/WM1NS), which compares the value of BTC against all the money sloshing in the US economy.










“The argument for Bitcoin relates to the eventual destruction of fiat currency units (e.g., USD) This chart… plots the price of Bitcoin BTC in relationship to total US money stock (M1). This ratio remains below the Dec 2017 high.”
Source: Peter Brandt/X
According to Brandt, the BTC/WM1NS chart reminds him of a pattern seen about four decades ago when the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index ignited a bull market to end the stagflation of the 1970s.
“Interesting to note similarities in chart structure to DJIA during period of Great Stagflation of 1970s. Some of you will deny the existence of continuation inverted H&S (head and shoulders) – so I will discuss it here. Schabacker (1934) and Edwards and Magee (1948) acknowledge this pattern by name. If the ID is good enough for them, then it is good enough for me.”
Source: Peter Brandt/X
An inverted head and shoulders pattern is a bullish formation indicating that buyers are no longer waiting for the price to revisit lows before entering. Should BTC/WM1NS witness a breakout, it would suggest that Bitcoin’s value is significantly outpacing the growing amount of US dollars.
Brandt also predicts that Bitcoin will outperform gold in the coming months.
“Since its inception, Bitcoin BTC has gained against gold. This chart shows the number of ounces of GC (gold) to buy one BTC. The ratio should chop for another 12 to 18 months – then advance to 100 ounces of GC to buy a BTC.”
Source: Peter Brandt/X
At time of writing, an ounce of gold is equivalent to $2,329, suggesting a BTC price of more than $230,000 if the ratio hits Brandt’s target.
Bitcoin is trading at $69,055 at time of writing.

Dogwifhat (WIF) Gains 7% Amid Bitcoin Rise - Key Areas to Watch


With Bitcoin (BTC) attempting to break the important $69,000 price level, dogwifhat (WIF) is experiencing bullish breakout momentum. 
Dogwifhat is up 7% today, indicating a possible bullish continuation.
Dogwifhat Price Action on the Daily Timeframe
WIF has exited its 1-day Ichimoku cloud to the upside, signaling very bullish market optimism. 
This breakout from the Ichimoku cloud strongly indicates that the bullish momentum is gaining traction. When a price trades above the Ichimoku cloud, it typically reflects a significant shift in market sentiment towards optimism and potential continued upward movement.
WIF Price Analysis. Source: Tradingview
Currently, WIF trades at $3.43, showing a substantial 7.44% increase. The price breaking above key Fibonacci levels further supports this bullish outlook. 
Specifically, the price is above the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $3.24 and is approaching the resistance level of $3.44 (0.38 Fibonacci level), signaling a possible continuation of the bullish trend.

Dogwifhat Analysis: 4-Hour Timeframe
WIF broke above the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $3.25, suggesting ongoing bullish momentum. The price structure shows that WIF has strong support and resistance levels. 
The key support levels to watch are $3.25, which corresponds to the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, and $3.05, which corresponds to the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. 
These levels are significant because they often act as zones where buyers step in, providing a foundation for price stability and potential upward movement.

WIF Price Analysis. Source: Tradingview
On the resistance side, WIF faces critical levels at $3.44, $3.68, and $4.07. The $3.44 level aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement, while $3.68 is at the 0.236 retracement. 
Another key resistance point is the previous high of $4.07. Breaking above these resistance levels could trigger significant upward momentum, attracting more buyers into the market.

The 4H – Ichimoku cloud analysis shows that the price trades within the 4-hour Ichimoku cloud, indicating significant volatility and a strong bullish trend.
Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 55.64, indicating neutral conditions. This neutral RSI reading implies that the price is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further upward movement without immediate risk of a sharp reversal
Strategic Recommendations
To capitalize on the bullish outlook, traders should focus on the resistance levels at $3.44 and $3.68. 
A breakthrough above these levels could lead to further gains. As long as the price stays above the Ichimoku cloud, signals from the Ichimoku cloud can help maintain a bullish stance. This guide is useful for holding long positions.

On the other hand, it’s essential to watch the key support levels at $3.25 and $3.05 closely. A drop below these levels could indicate a potential bearish shift. In such cases, traders should prepare for a reversal by considering exiting long positions or adopting risk management strategies. 
Implementing stop-loss orders below these key support levels can protect against significant losses, allowing traders to manage potential downside risks effectively.
Read More: Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030

By following these strategic recommendations, traders and investors can effectively navigate WIF’s price movements, leveraging bullish momentum while managing risks prudently. 
This balanced approach ensures informed decision-making and optimal positioning in the market.

Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin suffers 300 million USD hack - Crypto Valley Journal

One of Japan's lesser known crypto exchanges, DMM Bitcoin, lost 4,500 bitcoins worth over $300 million in a hack last week. This is the largest attack on a crypto company since the FTX collapse in November 2022.In a Japanese blog post, DMM Bitcoin shared the impact of the hack with the public. The exchange described the incident as an "unauthorized leak" of 4,500 bitcoin (BTC). DMM Bitcoin has already taken measures to prevent further unauthorized outflows. The exchange did not provide further details about the incident, but assured customers that the total amount is guaranteed.Another Japan based exchange gets hackedShortly before the blog post was published, the exchange restricted spot purchase orders and added a message stating that withdrawals in Japanese Yen may take longer than usual. DMM Bitcoin did not disclose whether an outsider was involved in the hack. Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is also investigating the incident. With the help of other companies in the group, the exchange will replace any lost bitcoin.The last attack on a Japanese crypto exchange of this magnitude occurred in 2018, when Coincheck suffered a hack worth $530 million. Additionally, Mt. Gox, one of the most famous exchange hacks in bitcoin history, was based in Japan. The DMM Bitcoin incident ranks third in terms of funds lost for a Japanese exchange. Globally, the hack ranks as the eighth largest crypto theft of all time-at least by the value of the funds at the time of the incident.Not your keys, not your coinsEvery cryptocurrency exchange hack should remind us of the "not your keys, not your coins" principle. In 2022 alone, numerous centralized service providers declared bankruptcy. In total, customers of FTX, Celsius, BlockFi and others lost over 10 billion USD. As the CVJ.CH editorial team pointed out at the time, the convenience of centralized service providers comes with additional risks. While being centralized the traditional banks in Switzerland still mitigates these risks.For those who still want to take on the responsibility of self-custody, the first CVJ.CH webinar with Rino Borini on setting up a bitcoin wallet will take place next week.

Bitcoin ETFs Go Live in Australia: Will This Spark a Global Trend?


							

Australia set to debut its first spot Bitcoin ETF, marking a milestone for cryptocurrency adoption in the country.



Coinbase targets Australia’s $600 billion pension market with new crypto services for retirees.



Wisconsin’s state investment board makes a splash with a $160 million Bitcoin ETF purchase.




Australia is set to join the growing ranks of countries offering spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) with the expected launch of its first such product the next day.







Barring any last-minute delays, Monochrome Asset Management has announced its Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) will begin trading on June 4. Trading under the ticker IBTC, the ETF will carry a 0.98% management fee. Monochrome Asset Management, the ETF’s sponsor, is offering this fund as a way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin within a regulated framework.



By tracking the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate index, the ETF will provide exposure directly correlated with the spot price of Bitcoin. This launch marks a significant milestone for the Australian market, allowing investors to access Bitcoin in a more regulated and secure manner.



While the smaller Cboe exchange will be the first in Australia to list a Bitcoin ETF, ahead of the larger Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), sources indicate the ASX is also likely to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs before year-end. This aggressive move suggests that Australian financial institutions are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential.



These launches capitalize on the unprecedented interest sparked by the U.S. market’s regulatory approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January. Those products saw substantial inflows from both institutional and retail investors, indicating a strong appetite for regulated Bitcoin investment vehicles.



In a related development, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) has drawn attention for its sizable investment in the Bitcoin space. A university professor associated with the board reportedly purchased $160 million worth of Bitcoin ETFs.







In a parallel development, cryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase announced its forthcoming launch of services tailored to Australia’s Self-Managed Superannuation Fund (SMSF) industry.



This move targets the nation’s $600 billion pension market, which is experiencing growing demand for Bitcoin investments. Coinbase’s initiative aims to provide Australian retirees with a simple and secure way to incorporate cryptocurrency into their retirement portfolios.

What we learned from the latest ETH ETF filing dump - Blockworks


A new slate of amended spot ether ETF applications are in, and at least one more round is expected before the products are able to launch. 
The latest document dump suggests another fee battle is in store and revealed that one issuer has decided to focus more on bitcoin. 
While the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 23 approved 19b-4 proposals filed by Cboe, NYSE Arca, and the Nasdaq to list such funds, the regulator now turns to finalizing S-1 registration statements as a last step before launch.

BlackRock revealed its $10 million in seed capital and authorized participants for its fund on Wednesday. But as more filings flooded in late Friday, one of the biggest takeaways was the planned price point of 0.19% for Franklin Templeton’s ether fund. 
The $1.6 trillion asset manager was the first to reveal its proposed fee, setting the stage for an expected fee war similar to what we saw in January among bitcoin ETF issuers. 
Franklin Templeton had undercut Bitwise to become the cheapest bitcoin ETF a day after those funds launched in January.  
Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, said he expects the spot ether ETF fee war to be “every bit as brutal and bloody” as the one surrounding BTC funds — adding that the two battles are tied together.“Fee competition in one category will likely impact the other, because end investors will expect comparable pricing on both,” Geraci told Blockworks.
Sumit Roy, a senior analyst at ETF.com, said fee waivers are also likely to play a role again as well. Permanent expense ratios could hit as low as 0.15%, he guessed.
“The 0.19% fee is super low, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see it undercut at some point,” Roy said.
Another main takeaway from the filing was the omission of Ark Invest’s name. The firm focused on disruptive innovation had partnered with 21Shares to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in January. The Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) has roughly $3.2 billion assets under management. 
A 21Shares spokesperson confirmed the fund will continue to try to launch the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF without Ark Invest as a partner. The two companies remain “committed partners” for ARKB and a range of futures-based products, the representative noted.

An Ark Invest spokesperson told Blockworks in an email that the firm views bitcoin as “a public good that everyone should be able to access at a low cost.”
“As for Ethereum, Ark believes in its transformative potential and the long-term value of the Ethereum blockchain but, at this time, Ark will not be moving forward with an Ethereum ETF,” the representative added. “We will continue evaluating efficient ways to provide our investors with exposure to this innovative technology in a way that unlocks its full benefits.”
Among the benefits missing from the current slate of planned spot ether ETFs is the yield gained from staking — a process of depositing ETH to help secure the Ethereum blockchain.

The effort of all issuers getting their amended S-1s in by the end of last week points to timely movement on getting these funds prepped for launch.
A source familiar with the filings told Blockworks the SEC has given issuers “informal guidance” that it will offer comments on their S-1 amendments by the end of this week.

2 Meme Stocks to Watch as the GameStop Saga Kicks Off Again - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Thanks to Keith Gill, the meme stock segment of the US stock market just got more complicated. Otherwise known as Roaring Kitty on X, or r/DeepFu*kingValue on Reddit, the social media personality/investor was one of the key figures behind the GameStop (NYSE: GME) short squeeze in early 2021. 



Following Gill’s social media resurgence, a repeat of that action played out in mid-May, although subdued. A snapshot percolated across social media from Sunday to Monday, triggering another GME stock price spike, from $23.14 to $39.85 per share. The purported account snapshot from Reddit’s r/Superstonk subreddit showed Gill holding 5 million GME shares, worth around $115.7 million on Friday.



More importantly, the snapshot showed Gill’s 120,000 GME call options at a strike price of $20 with an expiry date of June 21st. The purchase price of these contracts was at ~$5.68 per share, potentially netting $6.8 million at the time.



Image credit: Reddit


The implication of Keith Gill’s significant ownership of GME stock leads to previous buying of call options. Once the GME stock skyrocketed as he emerged on social media, a likely scenario would entail selling call options and buying GME shares again after the initial bubble burst.



Doing so repeatedly would have ballooned his portfolio. As seen by @unusual_whales’s tracking, these GME calls amounted to $65.7 million. In other words, Gill’s whale status introduced so much volatility that GameStop decided to halt GME trading today, having skyrocketed by 72% in aftermarket opening.



Putting aside the legality of Keith Gill pumping his bags at the expense of retail traders, should investors watch other meme stocks to mimic his success? Here are some prospective candidates.



Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NASDAQ: DJT)



Former President Trump’s conviction in NY court greatly boosted his campaign. According to @LeadingReport, Trump’s campaign broke all funding records at just over $200 million after the verdict. This is unsurprising because the verdict was primarily perceived as a subversion of the legal system to pursue short-term political gains.



Case in point, one of the most viral tweets addressing the issue received nearly 73 million views.



 



Simultaneously, Trump’s social media company, under ticker DJT, closed 5% down on Friday after a brief spike to $53.50 per share. At $48.85, DJT stock is still far from the 52-week high of $79.38.



Considering the ramp-up of political tensions ahead of the presidential elections and Trump’s more active social media engagement signaled from his first TikTok post, traders should expect more upswing volatility from the present DJT weakness.



However, traders should be agile because timing is everything in the meme stock market.





Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND)



Considering its weak fundamentals, Beyond Meat performed surprisingly well, losing only 4.5% of the value YTD. The company continues to struggle against its main obstacle—expensive meat substitutes against the cheaper real thing. This price disparity is compounded by the novelty of substituting meat in the first place.



At a time when plant-based meats in general are down 19% YoY, this is not a positive signal. However, the company is yet to utilize the rollout of more competitive products, the Beyond IV burgers and beef.



Having shifted from maligned canola oil to avocado oil, the gen-4 products neutralize the main critique of relying on seed oils. If claims of having the “meatiest, juiciest” burgers align with the public reception, BYND could hit previous highs.



In May’s earnings report, Beyond Meat’s CTO hinted at debt or equity funding to power through the revenue bleed. The company would need more capital to extend the runway after a net revenue decline of 18% YoY and a net loss of $54.4 million in Q1’24. Beyond Meat’s debt-to-equity ratio is holding at a relatively high -2.



Nonetheless, if Beyond Meat’s most recent rollout turns the fortunes around, investors could reap big gains. The company’s all-time high was $234 in July 2019 and $19.25 at its 52-week high. At $7.8 per share, BYND stock is closer to its 52-week low of $5.58, making a solid entry for gen-4 burger speculation.

Time to Buy Chiliz (CHZ)? Analyst Sets Sights on $0.43


								Chiliz (CHZ), the digital currency powering the sports fan engagement platform Socios.com, is stirring excitement in the crypto market with a potent combination of bullish technical indicators and a recent breakout from a downtrend.

CHZ Primed For Growth
CHZ has been on a steady climb over the medium to long term, reflecting a growing sense of optimism among investors. This positive sentiment is further amplified by the token’s approach to a critical resistance level of $0.16. A successful breach of this barrier could trigger a wave of buying activity, propelling CHZ to significantly higher price points.
Adding fuel to the fire, trading volume patterns are exhibiting a bullish bias. The presence of higher trading volume during price increases suggests robust underlying demand for CHZ. This demand, coupled with the technical breakout, fosters confidence that CHZ is poised for a significant price uptick.
This view is confirmed by prominent cryptocurrency expert Alex Clay, who has noted a bullish flag pattern on CHZ’s monthly chart. This technical configuration, often regarded as an indicator of significant price changes, aligns perfectly with the recent breakout from the downtrend channel.


Clay has identified possible price targets, with $0.26 serving as the first barrier and $0.4309 as the more ambitious second target. The breakout from the descending channel is a strong indicator that the downtrend is over and a new era of growth is beginning for Chiliz.
The confluence of technical factors and positive market sentiment paints a very optimistic picture for the token’s future.




Chiliz is currently trading at $0.14. Chart: TradingView
Optimistic Yet Cautious Outlook






While the near future appears bright for Chiliz, unexpected price swings can occur, and there’s always the possibility that the currency might encounter resistance at the aforementioned price levels.


Despite these potential roadblocks, the overall outlook for Chiliz is undeniably bullish. With a robust technical foundation, strong investor confidence, and a recent breakout from a downtrend, Chiliz is well-positioned for a potential price surge.

Investors with a high-risk tolerance and a keen eye on the sports fan engagement market should keep a close watch on CHZ’s developments in the coming weeks.

There's More Evidence 'Cryptoqueen' Was Murdered by Drug Kingpin: BBC - Decrypt

There's now more evidence that missing Cryptoqueen Dr. Ruja Ignatova might have been murdered by a Bulgarian drug kingpin because she had become a “liability,” according to a new episode of the BBC’s The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast.A new episode of "The Missing Cryptoqueen" podcast seems to back up last year’s reports that Ignatova had ties to the Bulgarian underworld and was murdered.In 2014, Ignatova launched OneCoin, a “revolutionary” new mineable cryptocurrency with a maximum supply of 120 billion coins, designed to mimic the success of Bitcoin. Over the next few years, she raised millions of dollars in investment, but it eventually became apparent that OneCoin was a scam. With multiple investigations looking into her, Ignatova disappeared in October 2017 after taking a flight from Bulgaria to Greece.In 2019, the BBC Sounds podcast The Missing Cryptoqueen started investigating the scam and Ignatova’s eventual disappearance. Then, in 2022, the FBI added her to their Top Ten Most Wanted list, where she remains to this day.In 2023, an investigation by Bulgarian news outlet Bird reported that Ignatova was killed in 2018 after being handed documents that were reportedly found in the possession of a murdered Bulgarian police official. Those documents, which have since been verified, claim her murder was ordered by a drug kingpin known as Taki and that her body was then dumped into the Ionian Sea.According to a new report from the BBC World Service’s Eye Investigations and Panorama, Ignatova had been paying Taki for protection while he had been using the OneCoin network to launder money.“We do have evidence that a very significant, if not the most prolific, drug trafficker of all time in Bulgaria was closely linked to OneCoin [and] served as [Ruja Ignatova’s] personal security guard,” an assistant attorney told the BBC in 2019, with Taki thought to be earning $100,000 a month for his services.The new Missing Cryptoqueen episode also reports that a number of sources have told them that Ruja was murdered by Taki because she had become a “liability” due to the number of investigations that OneCoin was facing. “Knowing how violent cartels are, if [Taki] thought she was a threat to him, he would probably take her out instead of getting caught,” said former IRS reporter Richard Reinhardt.Leaked documents from former spy Frank Schneider apparently confirm that Operation Satellite, the codename of the international police investigation into Ruja and OneCoin, was looking into her relationship with Taki.In 2023, Kuro, a member of Taki’s organization, his wife, and two other people were murdered in Cape Town. While police are still searching for the killers, Bulgarian former deputy minister Ivan Hristanov called the “public execution” a “statement.”“Certain people had to be removed because they knew too much about Taki,” he added.“It’s a good theory. It’s credible,” said the team behind The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, but they also believe that rumors surrounding Ruja’s death could be spread to help her stay hidden. There have been numerous sightings of Dr. Ruja in recent years, and the FBI has yet to remove her from their Top Ten Most Wanted list.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

These Meme Coins Skyrocket Triple Digit as 'Roaring Kitty' Returned to Reddit


																Keith Gill, known online as “Roaring Kitty,” posted on Reddit that he is holding $181.4 million worth of GameStop (GME) stock and call options.
Following his Reddit post, GME, ROAR, and KITTY meme coins gained 315%, 660%, and 477%, respectively.
GameStop Meme Coin Rally
Gill’s post, titled “GME YOLO update – June 2, 2024,” marks his first Reddit activity in three years. Under his account “u/DeepFuckingValue,” Gill disclosed $65.7 million in GameStop call options and $115.7 million in shares.
According to Jason Hitchcock, Head of Ecosystem at web3 development platform thirdweb, Gill’s combined holdings effectively equate to owning 17 million GameStop shares. At the last trading price of $23 per share, this puts the value of his position at approximately $391 million, representing 5.6% of GameStop’s market cap.






Following Gill’s post, meme coins inspired by GameStop and Roaring Kitty saw significant growth. GME, ROAR, and KITTY surged by 315%, 660%, and 477%, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. However, they have retraced, trading at $0.01005, $0.00959, and $0.00181, respectively, at the time of writing. GameStop’s stock itself has had a pre-market increase of over 300%.
GME is a Solana-based token that uses the same ticker as GameStop but has no official affiliation with the company. Similarly, ROAR and KITTY are themed around Gill’s online persona but are not officially connected to him.
Roaring Kitty Teases GameStop Frenzy Return
The Roaring Kitty X account was also reactivated last month, with a Sunday post featuring an Uno reverse card hinting at a repeat of the 2021 GameStop frenzy, where Gill and the subreddit /WallStreetBets were central figures in the meme stock frenzy that saw shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment soar over 1,000%.


However, not all reactions were positive. A post on r/WallStreetBets expressed frustration at Gill’s long absence and the resulting uncertainty for retail investors. “DFV posted in r/Superstonk, and you should go over there and do ape stuff if you’re into that,” wrote contributor u/zjz.
“Good luck RK, crazy f—ing position, but your whole schtick and disappearance really f—ed retail up and it’d be nice if you didn’t leave them on a cliffhanger for the rest of the world to deprogram this time.”
Trader Keyboard Monkey on X cautioned that Gill’s recent actions might be a setup to capitalize on the renewed hype.

OKX user claims to have lost $2 million in deep fake AI scam

A user known as “来日方长” (The Future is Long) has reported a significant security breach involving their OKX account, resulting in a loss exceeding $2 million. According to WuBlockchain, the user detailed that scammers had obtained all of his personal information through Telegram. Utilizing this data, the attackers accessed his email account and initiated a password reset. They then employed an AI-generated video to change his phone number, email address, and Google Authenticator settings. This sophisticated method allowed the scammers to drain the account within 24 hours.The incident emphasizes the growing threat of AI-driven cybercrime in the crypto sector. Deepfake technology, which can mimic a person’s voice, face, and gestures, has been increasingly used in cyber attacks. As reported by Government Technology, these AI-generated deepfakes can deliver disinformation and fraudulent messages at an unprecedented scale and sophistication, making them harder to detect and stop. This new generation of cyber attacks is undermining trust in digital interactions, posing significant challenges for both individuals and organizations.The breach involving 来日方长 is part of a broader trend of AI-related fraud. Earlier this year, Fortune highlighted the emergence of OnlyFake, a site capable of producing highly realistic fake IDs that can fool know-your-customer processes at crypto exchanges like OKX. These developments indicate that cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging AI to bypass traditional security measures.In response to these threats, experts emphasize the importance of enhanced security awareness and training. As noted by Government Technology, effective security awareness training can change security culture, making individuals more vigilant and better equipped to detect sophisticated phishing attacks. Moreover, organizations are encouraged to adopt new technology tools that use AI to detect and prevent message fraud, thereby fighting fire with fire.As of now, neither OKX nor the cybersecurity firm SlowMist has issued a response regarding the incident involving 来日方长. CryptoSlate has reached out to OKX for comment but has not received a response as of press time. WuBlockchain has urged exchanges to heighten their security measures and for users to be more vigilant about the protection of their personal information to mitigate the risk of such advanced attacks. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the evolving nature of AI cyber threats and the need for continuous adaptation in security practices.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

As the Shiba Inu community keeps removing meme coins from circulation, the SHIB price keeps making attempts to break out.Within the last 24 hours, the Shiba Inu price has increased by 3.79%, rising from $0.00002430 to the $0.00002511 price mark, where it is changing hands at the time of this writing.According to the Shibburn tracker, millions of SHIB meme coins have been scorched in a single transaction.SHIB burn rate up 348%The Shibburn platform has shown that within the last 24 hours, the burn rate of the second most popular canine-themed token, SHIB, has spiked by slightly more than 348%, with a total of 21,508,945 SHIB transferred to unspendable blockchain wallets during this time.The majority of this amount was destroyed in a single move as an anonymous crypto whale transferred 21,315,658 SHIB to a dead-end wallet approximately an hour ago.That was the largest out of the four transactions spotted by Shibburn since yesterday morning. The second largest one carried 100,000 meme coins. Last week, the SHIB army celebrated the three-year anniversary of Vitalik Buterin burning 410 trillion Shiba Inu.SHIB rep issues major scam warningThe SHIB Discord admin, known within the community as DaVinci, has published several messages to warn the SHIB army against blindly investing in new projects allegedly backed by the Shiba Inu developers.These messages were shared on the X platform by several SHIB enthusiasts. In them, the admin of the SHIB Discord channel stated that, recently, some “deceitful individuals” have begun issuing tokens, while falsely claiming that they were made in collaboration with the SHIB team.According to DaVinci, these crypto con artists have changed their tactics, “moving from their misuse of Ryoshi Research mediums to the exploitation of Shiba State and the Canine code.”They have also been adding the shib.io address to their scam videos to give them an authentic look and add false credibility to their scam schemes. DaVinci also hinted that these scammers are using the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange to launch their fake tokens. The SHIB rep admitted that since ShibaSwap is decentralized, the team cannot just ban those scam tokens. Therefore, DaVinci urged the SHIB army to be extremely careful and conduct detailed research before investing in any project similar to the ones mentioned above.

Notcoin Surges 219% With Billions in Trading Volume as TON Reenters Top 10 - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsA token tied to the Telegram-based clicker game Notcoin (NOT) has surged to over $2 billion in market cap in recent days, skyrocketing in price just weeks after its debut.Airdropped in May to users for repeatedly tapping a digital gold coin in-game, Notcoin has risen 5% over the past day to $0.022, according to data from CoinGecko, further propelling a 219% gain over the last seven days. In the past two weeks alone, the cryptocurrency has rallied a whopping 300% amid users’ ongoing endeavors.Released on The Open Network (TON), the game that had users fervently tapping away at their screens has emerged as the largest gaming-related token launched so far this year. It’s currently the 57th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.Over this past weekend, the price of Notcoin hit an all-time high above $0.028. At that moment, the cryptocurrency posted a market capitalization of $2.77 billion—a steep increase compared to the coin’s total value of around $565 million shortly after the airdrop in late May.More than $4.2 billion worth of Notcoin has traded hands over the last 24 hours, per data from CoinMarketCap, with nearly $2.4 billion of that coming from exchange giant Binance. OKX was next up with $630 million in trading volume, followed by Bybit with about $436 million.Last month, the project released “earnings missions” that let users earn NOT passively by completing certain tasks. In previous scenarios, Notcoin users completed actions—namely tapping—in hopes of receiving a one-time allocation of the cryptocurrency.Meanwhile, The Open Network has seen its native token Toncoin (TON) rise as well. Adopted by messaging app Telegram as its “official Web3 infrastructure” last year, the coin linked to The Open Network has seen its price rise to $6.65 over the past 30 days, posting a 16% gain.On Monday, Toncoin saw gains over the past day of 2.6%. Still, after being pushed out of its top-ten spot by market capitalization last week, Toncoin’s recent gains were enough to reclaim the spot at nearly $16 billion, which was previously held by Cardano. But they're still very close in market capitalization, as of this writing.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Ethereum ETF: What ETH Price Impact To Expect - Benzinga

The impending arrival of spot Ethereum ETFs has sent ripples of excitement through the crypto market.But with such a groundbreaking development, many investors are wondering: what can we expect from the price of Ethereum ETH/USD moving forward?Crypto analyst Flow has delved into this very question, offering a scenario analysis based on potential inflows into the ETF and historical price movements of Bitcoin BTC/USD. According to the analyst, these ETFs could lead to substantial price movements and increased investor interest in Ethereum.Predicted Inflows And Market ImpactEstimating the exact inflows into the Ethereum ETFs is challenging. However, predictions from various experts offer a range of expectations:
Goldman Sachs anticipates net inflows between $1 billion and $3 billion for the remainder of the year.



Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas expects Ethereum ETFs to capture around 15-20% of the inflows seen with Bitcoin ETFs.



Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan suggests net inflows could be between 25-50% of those for Bitcoin ETFs in the first four months of trading.



Grayscale forecasts that Ethereum ETFs will attract roughly 25-30% of the demand seen by Bitcoin ETFs​.
Also Read: US Bitcoin ETFs Cap $170M Inflow Week As Australia Welcomes First Spot Bitcoin ETFPrice Impact And Scenario AnalysisFlow's analysis extrapolates these predictions to estimate the potential price impact on Ethereum. By comparing the price movements of Bitcoin following its ETF launches, Flow suggests that every billion dollars in net inflows could move Ethereum's price by approximately 10.8%. This calculation assumes Ethereum is four times more reactive to market inflows than Bitcoin due to factors like its deflationary supply and the amount staked​.Based on these assumptions, the following price scenarios for Ethereum by the end of 2024 have been derived:
Bear Case: ETH at $4,428



Base Case: ETH at $5,294



Bull Case: ETH at $6,730​.
Factors Influencing Ethereum ETF PerformanceSeveral factors could influence the performance of Ethereum ETFs:
Market Sentiment: Ethereum’s value proposition as a decentralized computer network could attract substantial interest over time, although its complexity may initially deter some retail investors.



Regulatory Environment: Significant outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust to the new ETFs are expected due to the latter’s higher liquidity, narrower spreads, and lower fees.



Staking Availability: Currently, there is no staking option available for ETFs, which might evolve, potentially adding a positive element to Ethereum's market dynamics​.
Looking AheadAs the Ethereum ETF trading start date approaches, market participants are keenly observing how these products will influence ETH’s price and overall market dynamics. For those interested in deeper insights into the evolving digital assets landscape, the Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will provide a comprehensive overview of these trends and more. This event promises to offer valuable perspectives on the future of digital assets, including the anticipated impacts of Ethereum ETFs.Read Next: BRETT Hits $1B Market Cap But ‘Has Not Even Scratched The Surface,’ Says TraderImage: Shutterstock

XRP's 10 Million TVL Milestone Signals Growing Demand for Ripple's Token


							

XRPL reaches 10M XRP total value locked, 25% of Uniswap V3 pairs.



Ripple to release 1B XRP and re-lock 800M tokens in escrow.



XRP price rises 1.12%; the current market cap is $28.83 billion.




XRP saw a surge in activity and value locked on its ledger after a prominent validator, known as Vet, announced a milestone of 10 million XRP Total Value Locked (TVL) on the network. The announcement coincided with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) reaching 25% of Uniswap V3’s total pairings with 500 pairs on its platform, signaling growing confidence and adoption in the XRP ecosystem.







Vet was upbeat about the possibility of more volume and swaps, stressing that Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) and Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are essential to all DeFi operations.



TVL saw a huge increase less than a day after XRP advocate lawyer Bill Morgan announced that $5 million worth of XRP had been locked. This quick expansion highlights the XRPL ecosystem’s growing confidence and activity, indicating a larger trend toward DeFi integration and growth. 



Coinciding with these developments, Ripple plans to release 1 billion XRP as part of its monthly escrow process. Out of these, 800 million of these tokens will be locked back in escrow after the release, demonstrating Ripple’s dedication to a steady supply and efficient token distribution management. This strategic decision is expected to significantly impact the market dynamics and liquidity of XRP.



Meanwhile, according to the most recent CoinGecko data, the XRP price is currently trading at roughly $0.5201, up 1.12% over the last 24 hours. With a market capitalization of over $28.83 billion, the token is clearly a major player in the cryptocurrency space.



The recent milestones and this price movement suggest an optimistic outlook and increasing interest in XRP and its ecosystem.

Will Binance Delist Stablecoins in Europe? CEO Richard Teng Made a Breaking Statement - Bitcoin Sistemi


Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by transaction volume, announced that it would soon limit the availability of stablecoins, which are considered “unregulated” by the European Union (EU).
Binance CEO Richard Teng addressed speculation that Binance may delist some stablecoins. Teng said in his statement:



“I would like to take a moment to answer one of the biggest questions being asked about our strategy for the upcoming MiCA stablecoin rules.
Rest assured that Binance will not directly delist unauthorized stablecoins but will only limit their availability to certain products for European Economic Area (EEA) users. Updates regarding regulated stablecoins will be shared soon.”


Binance has not yet received an official answer to the question of which stablecoins fall into the “unregulated” category.
As stablecoins become regulated in Europe, Binance said only tokens issued by “regulated companies” will be available to the public. “Some existing stablecoins may not fall into this category and will therefore be subject to certain restrictions,” the company added.





The company stated that the rules for stablecoins, as outlined in the EU's CryptoAsset Markets Directive (MiCA), will come into force at the end of June. “This will be the first step into the new regulatory framework and will have a significant impact on the stablecoin market in the European Economic Area,” the statement said.

Binance Faces New EU Regulations for Stablecoins


Starting on June 30, Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange, will apply new rules on unapproved stablecoins in the European Union.
This move is a response to the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, which are designed to create clear rules for digital assets in the area.
Binance Will Restrict Unregulated Stablecoins in the EU

The MiCA law, recently approved by the European Parliament, sets strict rules for creating and managing stablecoins. To follow these new rules, Binance will limit the use of unapproved stablecoins on its platform. The platform is asking its users to switch to stablecoins that meet MiCA’s requirements to avoid problems with their trading activities.
Beginning June 30, users will not be able to trade, deposit, or withdraw stablecoins that do not follow MiCA guidelines. Binance’s decision shows its commitment to following regulations and protecting its users.

“This will be a first step entering the new regulatory framework and it will have a significant impact on the stablecoin market in the European Economic Area,” the statement said.

Read more: What Is Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)?
By limiting unapproved stablecoins, Binance aims to reduce risks tied to unregulated assets and improve market stability. The company has also offered resources and guidance to help users switch smoothly to approved stablecoins. This support includes educational materials and customer assistance to help users understand the new regulations.
The MiCA framework in the EU is a crucial regulation aimed at providing clarity and uniformity to the cryptocurrency market. It is relevant for various digital assets and service providers and establishes stringent guidelines for transparency, administration, and consumer safeguarding. In particular, MiCA mandates that stablecoins adhere to stringent operational and reserve criteria in order to guarantee their stability and dependability.

Binance’s proactive steps are part of a larger trend where digital asset platforms are following more rules to avoid legal and operational problems. By following MiCA guidelines, Binance aims to reduce risks and provide smooth service to users. This action is likely to set an example for other exchanges in the EU, promoting a safer and more regulated environment.

The histogram bars indicate that the the deviation is skewed to the bulls side.

Was There Actually a Hidden Purpose Behind the Approval of Ethereum ETFs? Bernstein Commented - Bitcoin Sistemi

After US President Joe Biden vetoed a bill aimed at repealing the anti-cryptocurrency SAB 121, analysts at research and brokerage firm Bernstein noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs last month He was skeptical of the idea that political influence played a role.
Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra addressed this issue in a note to clients today. They argued that the SEC's decision to approve Ethereum ETFs was likely driven by pragmatic considerations rather than political pressure.


“Given that the President vetoed the SAB 121 repeal bill, the politically motivated theory seems less credible, and it is likely that the SEC took a more pragmatic approach and avoided a legal challenge,” analysts wrote.
The SEC's approval came in the form of 19b-4 forms for eight spot Ethereum ETFs from leading firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity on May 23. However, these issuers must have their S-1 registration statements go into effect before trading can begin, a process that can take several days or weeks.






Analysts have noted that the SEC is likely cornered on approval, highlighting the regulatory similarities between Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs. “The SEC knew it was backed into a corner with the ETH ETF, which has the same regulatory structure as the Bitcoin ETF (same spot/futures correlation and ETH futures being active, indicating the current commodity status of the CME ETH futures market),” they added.
Going forward, Bernstein analysts predict strong demand for new Ethereum ETFs, but expect lower allocations compared to spot Bitcoin ETFs. They highlighted Ethereum's unique supply dynamics, such as staking, smart contracts, and HODL data, as factors that could drive positive price movement following the launch of ETFs, which is expected to occur within the next few days to a month.

SEC ‘Bent on Choking’ Crypto Industry, Says Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal - The Daily Hodl


								The chief legal officer of crypto exchange Coinbase says that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is determined to stifle the digital asset industry.
In a new thread on the social media platform X, Coinbase executive Paul Grewal says that the regulatory agency is “bent on choking” the digital assets industry by mandating rules that are “unworkable” for crypto firms.










According to Grewal, the SEC is claiming jurisdiction over the crypto industry without Congress authorization or making clear guidelines.
“Today we filed our closing brief in the Third Circuit challenging the SEC’s denial of our rulemaking petition. At the core of this case is a single, conclusory sentence in the SEC order under review. 
That sentence – which ‘disagree[d]’ that SEC rules are unworkable for digital asset firms – offered no reasoned decision making; it offered no reason at all. 
The SEC’s order must be vacated on this elementary ground alone. The SEC cannot claim broad jurisdiction over a new industry without proper authorization from Congress and without making clear rules.”
Grewal also says that the SEC is firm about suppressing the growth of the crypto industry by ignoring requests for regulatory clarity.
“Remarkably, the SEC says – over and over again – that it doesn’t matter if the industry can comply with the rules. The SEC is bent on choking the digital asset industry and is refusing to provide the necessary rules the industry has requested in order to tighten the squeeze.” 
In July 2022, Coinbase filed a petition with the SEC to create a new regulatory framework for digital assets, but the regulator rejected the proposal, saying that it disagreed with the idea that securities laws do not apply to the crypto industry.
Coinbase has sought the assistance of the court to compel the SEC to engage in rulemaking. In the crypto exchange’s latest filing, Coinbase says the SEC continues to double down on holding back the industry.
 “The SEC’s response brief is confirmatory: Confirmatory that the government is intent on crushing the digital asset industry. Confirmatory that the SEC will advance the most startling, inconsistent, and insupportable propositions of law to prolong its oppressive campaign. 
And confirmatory that anything other than an order to promptly commence rulemaking will abet the dithering and delay that is central to the SEC’s multi-prong attack.”

Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Traditional 60/40 PortfolioProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

Linea's Blockchain Halt Ignites Decentralization Debate


The recent halt of Linea’s blockchain has ignited discussions about its commitment to decentralization as an Ethereum Layer-2 (L2) solution.
Significant security concerns drove the decision, and industry experts weighed in on the implications for the project’s decentralized future.
Linea’s Effort in Balancing Decentralization and Security

Following Linea’s decision to halt block production, Alex Gluchowski, CEO of Matter Labs, emphasized the importance of decentralization in L2 projects. He noted that central control could undermine the principles that Ethereum L2 projects aim to uphold.

“Decentralizing the sequencer isn’t optional. Every serious L2 stack must race to do first,” he said.

Responding to Gluchowski’s statement, Declan Fox, the Product Lead at Linea, asserted their commitment to decentralizing all aspects of their network. Fox expressed confidence in their progress despite being a newer project compared to others.

“Agree that decentralization is not an option. Linea is on a solid path to decentralizing all aspects of the network in a very aggressive time window. Given that many Rollup frameworks more than 2 years older than us are no further ahead, I’m pretty delighted with our pace,” Fox stated.

The Linea team also affirmed its commitment to decentralize its network, including the sequencer. They highlighted that achieving a decentralized, censorship-resistant environment would prevent them from halting block production or censoring addresses in the future.

“Linea’s goal is to decentralize our network—including the sequencer. When our network matures to a decentralized, censorship-resistant environment, Linea’s team will no longer have the ability to halt block production and censor addresses—this is a primary goal of our network. Most L2s, including Linea, still rely on centralized technical operations, which can be leveraged to protect ecosystem participants. Linea’s core value is a permissionless, censorship-resistant environment, so it was not a decision we took lightly,” the team wrote.

Linea stopped its blockchain activities after a security breach occurred on Velocore, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that operates on its network. The breach led to the unauthorized transfer of $2.6 million from the Linea network via an undisclosed bridge service.

VIDEO

Linea suspended its sequencer to prevent the attacker from illegally moving more assets, as they could not reach the Velocore exchange team in time. Additionally, Linea blocked the hacker’s addresses to minimize the impact on its users.

Linea defended its actions, stating that the hacker was starting to sell a significant amount of tokens for ETH. This could have led to additional user problems beyond the liquidity pool-draining exploit.
Despite the controversy, Yu Xian, founder of cybersecurity firm SlowMist, defended the suspension. He argued that it was plausible considering the project’s early stage. Furthermore, Xian stressed the importance of ensuring robust security before achieving full decentralization.

“Choosing to suspend itself and blacklist the L2 of the relevant address to stop the loss of an ecological project being hacked is understandable in the early stage, but it will become more and more impossible as time goes by. The challenges of security and trust are so great,” Xian opined.

Throughout history, there have been cases where developers have temporarily stopped their blockchain operations in response to major security breaches. For instance, in 2022, Binance’s BNB Chain was halted in response to a debilitating bridge hack worth $566 million. Despite the debate, many regard these measures as essential to safeguard the network’s integrity and user security.

RoaringKitty returns to pump GameStop, stock market breaks


Protos previously reported that GameStop was quietly rallying again, this time without the assistance of Keith Gill (aka DeepFuckingValue, aka RoaringKitty). However, that’s apparently no longer the case as Gill reappeared this weekend, not only on X (formerly Twitter) but also on Reddit.
On X, Gill simply posted a green Uno reverse card, while on Reddit he shared his portfolio composition that appears to show $115 million in GameStop stock and ~$66 million in GameStop call options. The post is the first time that Gill has shared anything on Reddit since April 2021.
It’s unclear how Gill was able to acquire so much capital unless he was able to bottom and top-tick GameStop stock previously or is receiving some sort of outside funding.
Gill’s return prompted GameStop to shoot up in price yet again, from $22.91 to over $40.00 a share at open. Since then, the stock has largely returned to earth, trading at just over $30 as of writing. RobinHood customers reported overnight trading issues largely related to price volatility and volume.

Stock market breaks, Berkshire woes
Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is having anything but a normal day, with numerous brokerages having outages, multiple stocks going untraded for minutes at a time, and the highest price stock on the exchange — Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares, which normally trade for over $600,000 apiece — plummeting over 99% for seemingly no reason whatsoever.
Forbes accidentally used the faulty data to update its rich list, showing Warren Buffett falling thousands of places and losing hundreds of billions of dollars in a day.
Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares haven’t recovered or shown actual pricing and it isn’t currently being traded. Significantly, the company’s Class B shares haven’t seen the same type of value disintegration, falling less than one percent.
The NYSE stated that it’s investigating a technical issue on the exchange related to limit up-limit down orders, but didn’t get into specifics.

Record in Ethereum After SEC Approval: 800 Thousand ETH worth 3 Billion Dollars Bought! Who Bought These ETHs? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Last week, the SEC approved spot Ethereum ETFs, following Bitcoin ETFs. However, while the final approval was not yet received, investors started to prepare for the final approval.
At this point, the CryptoQuant analyst said that since the SEC approved spot Ethereum ETFs, more than 800,000 ETH worth approximately $3 billion have left crypto exchanges.


Pointing out that a similar situation occurred for BTC in January, the analyst thinks that ETHs issued from the stock exchanges were purchased by unknown persons or institutions.
The analyst said that behind the record outflow of 800 thousand Ethereum worth approximately $ 3 billion in 8 days, there may be whales or individuals who think that the price will increase after the ETF approval, or institutions preparing for the spot ETF.





Stating that this situation is a bullish signal for the ETH price, the analyst wrote:

“Following the approval of the Spot Ethereum ETF, there was an outflow of over 800,000 Ethereum from the exchanges. We saw similar situations after the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs.
Following this groundbreaking ETH approval, unknown individuals or institutions withdrew 800 thousand Ethereum worth approximately $3 billion from exchanges within 8 days. We don't know who is behind these purchases.
Behind these purchases may be whales or individuals who think that the price will increase after the approval of the ETF, or institutions that are preparing for the approval of the ETF. These institutions may want to meet the demand of their investors with the launch of a spot ETH ETF.
“No matter who it is, we can expect that withdrawing this amount of Ethereum from exchanges will have a positive impact on the price in the medium term.”

SEC's Ethereum ETF Approval!
The SEC approved spot Ethereum ETFs on May 23. Prior to approval, the SEC began contacting potential issuers and later approved the companies' 19b-4 applications.


Despite this approval, trade in the products was not immediately allowed. S-1 filings must also be approved before the ETFs can begin trading, and analysts estimate the ETFs could begin trading in late June.

Bitcoin's Macro Outlook This Week: 'The Trend Is Our Friend,' Says Analyst - Benzinga

Crypto and macro analyst Ted provided a comprehensive market outlook, highlighting key economic trends and their potential impact on Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD.What Happened: Ted noted that inflation, as measured by the PCE data, has shown signs of slowing, "Core printed 2.7% year-over-year, and headline 2.8%." However, these are slightly above the Fed’s 2% target, the downward trend is seen as positive. "The trend is very much our friend in this case," the analyst added, suggesting optimism for long-term risk asset bulls.With inflation seemingly under control, the market focus shifts to employment data, a critical component of the Fed’s mandate. "May’s report is due on Friday, expecting a steady 3.9% unemployment rate and 185,000 jobs added," Ted outlined.Meeting these expectations could reinforce the uptrend in risk assets, with Bitcoin testing new highs in the coming weeks. Traditional finance investors could be attracted to allocating gains into Spot Bitcoin ETFs which has slowed down recently.He pointed out Bitcoin's weekly range between $63,300 and $72,200, while Ethereum is trading in a range between $3,440 -and $4,110. For Bitcoin, the critical support level to watch is $66,000, tied to the one-day 50EMA, which is identified for preserving the short-term trend.Also Read: Bitcoin’s New All-Time High Depends On This Macro Indicator: 10x ResearchWhy It Matters: Ted’s analysis links current economic conditions with potential market movements, highlighting the importance of both inflation and employment data. The upcoming Fed meeting in nine days and Friday’s employment numbers are pivotal events that could quickly reprice market expectations.Despite the PCE data aligning with expectations and not causing significant immediate market reactions, it’s seen as setting the stage for potential future central bank easing. "This data is optimistic for risk asset bulls longer term," Ted explained, emphasizing a favorable outlook if inflation continues to be controlled.May’s total non-farm payroll employment increase by 175,000 and the latest unemployment rate at 3.9% did little to change the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which increased 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively from May 3 to May 5.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Bitcoin To Surge Over $110K In Q3 Despite Impending Recession Fears, Says Economist Henrik ZebergThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

The analyst pseudonymously known as The Flow Horse tells his 217,900 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum (ETH) is one of the main plays to look at from now until late this year.










His other picks include memecoin Pepe (PEPE), MAGA (TRUMP), a memecoin inspired by presidential candidate Donald Trump and Ondo Finance (ONDO), a project focused on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs).
“ETH, Pepe, Trump, Ondo. Don’t want a fifth, just throw it in the king (Bitcoin). Six months max timeframe.” 
The analyst says that in the long term, simply holding Bitcoin (BTC) is likely the best risk-adjusted play rather than attempting to pick altcoins.
“BTC: I can hold a spot stack comfortably forever, maybe ETH too. Hanging on to alts is always historically a losing strategy.” 
Ethereum is trading for $3,787 at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, ONDO is trading for $1.38 at time of writing, up nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.
MAGA is trading for $14.59 at time of writing, down more than 8% in the last 24 hours. TRUMP, launched late last year on Ethereum, is up more than 213% in the last 30 days. The memecoin’s strong performance has also boosted the value of Donald Trump’s own crypto holdings.
Pepe is trading for $0.00001499 at time of writing, up more than 72% in the last 30 days.
Last month, blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain noticed that one crypto whale withdrew 592 billion PEPE from Binance, the world’s top crypto exchange, which was worth nearly $8 million at the time of the transaction.

Coinbase Donates $25 Million to Fairshake to Defeat 'Anti-Crypto Candidates' - Decrypt

Coinbase, America’s dominant crypto exchange, announced Monday that it has donated an additional $25 million to industry political action committee (PAC) Fairshake in the latest escalation of crypto-related spending on the 2024 election. That spend brings Fairshake’s total haul this cycle to $160 million, making it one of the largest PACs attempting to influence the outcome of November’s election. In fact, only ActBlue and WinRed—the primary payment processors for the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively—show larger hauls this cycle, according to OpenSecrets.Coinbase’s latest $25 million gift to Fairshake follows that of fellow American crypto corporations Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz, which both made matching donations last week. The three companies were the principal initial bankrollers of Fairshake, which launched late last year as a means to support pro-crypto candidates in federal elections.Paired with last week's contributions, today's donation has nearly doubled the size of Fairshake’s war chest in a matter of days. They also come at a particularly lively political moment for crypto, in which presidential candidates and federal legislators alike have focused near-unprecedented attention on the industry, both positive and negative. On May 22, the U.S. House of Representatives passed FIT 21, a regulatory framework for the crypto industry. The landmark vote came just days after an unexpectedly large contingent of Democratic senators broke with President Joe Biden to support the repeal of SAB 121, an anti-crypto rule instituted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On Friday, Biden vetoed the SAB 121 repeal, underscoring crypto-related tensions not just in national politics, but within his own party.The recent upswing of crypto-related movement in Washington appears to have emboldened companies like Coinbase, which seek to turn crypto into a key election year issue, and have threatened to unload millions of dollars against the campaigns of vocal—or perceived—anti-crypto candidates.“The best way to get regulatory clarity in democratic countries is to elect pro-crypto candidates on both sides of the aisle, and to vote anti-crypto candidates out of office,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a blunt statement announcing the Fairshake donation today. For a brief period last month, it seemed as if crypto was careening towards partisan issue status, with former president Donald Trump appearing to embrace the industry explicitly, and Biden indicating his displeasure with pro-crypto legislation. In recent months, political chatter within the crypto industry has taken a markedly pro-Trump shift. The former U.S. president and presumptive Republican nominee for 2024 has openly embraced cryptocurrency in recent weeks, including opening up crypto donations towards his campaign.Coinbase’s CEO attempted to emphasize Monday that his company’s willingness to assert political influence—an impulse other American crypto firms have resisted—does not mean the industry is choosing one political party over another. “This must be a bipartisan effort,” Armstrong wrote. “Crypto is truly a bipartisan issue.”Fairshake, however, has so far overwhelmingly focused its efforts on targeting liberal political candidates it perceives as anti-crypto. Of the $11.3 million the PAC has already spent on the 2024 election, 93.8% of that money has gone either against Democrats or towards Republicans, per OpenSecrets.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Strategies for Web3 Founders Amid US Crypto Crackdown


Web3 founders face unprecedented challenges, especially in light of the recent US crypto crackdown. The $4 billion settlement with Binance and legal actions against its CEO highlight the intensified regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency market. 
This crackdown reflects the necessity for Web3 startups to adapt their strategies to navigate the regulatory environment effectively.
Regulation Boosts Investors’ Confidence
The US regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies has become increasingly stringent. Regulatory bodies emphasize compliance with financial regulations, anti-money laundering (AML) standards, and customer protection mechanisms. 

“The $4 billion settlement with Binance, along with the legal actions against its CEO, represents a significant moment for the global cryptocurrency market,” Maria Fiorentini, co-founder at Mujeres en Derecho, told BeInCrypto.

This heightened scrutiny necessitates that Web3 founders implement robust crypto compliance frameworks to align with regulatory expectations. Indeed, investor confidence plays a critical role in the success of Web3 startups. 

VIDEO

Regulatory actions against major players like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken have shaken investor confidence due to the highlighted risks and uncertainties within the cryptocurrency market. However, in the long term, stringent regulations could clean up the industry, thereby bolstering investor trust. 

“The impact on investor confidence can be seen from two angles… These actions could either bolster investor confidence by cleaning up the industry or discourage them due to strict regulations,” Fiorentini noted.


Web3 founders should focus on transparency and compliance to reassure investors and attract long-term investments. 
Therefore, to navigate the regulatory environment, Web3 startups must implement robust AML and Know Your Customer (KYC) programs. Effective KYC procedures involve verifying customer identities, conducting background checks, and ensuring compliance with international sanctions lists. 
Read more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?
Enhanced due diligence is essential for high-risk customers, including those engaging in large transactions or operating from high-risk jurisdictions. According to Fiorentini, Web3 founders can mitigate risks by establishing these programs and demonstrating their commitment to regulatory compliance.
A Comprehensive Compliance Framework
Fiorentini believes that a comprehensive compliance framework is vital for Web3 startups. This includes establishing a dedicated regulatory compliance team responsible for understanding, implementing, and updating the company’s practices in line with current laws and regulations. 
Regular internal and external audits of compliance programs can help identify vulnerabilities and ensure adherence to regulatory requirements. 
Advanced monitoring and reporting systems are also crucial for detecting and preventing suspicious activities. Indeed, real-time transaction monitoring technologies can identify large transactions, rapid movements of assets, or patterns indicative of money laundering. 

VIDEO

Procedures for promptly reporting suspicious activities to relevant authorities are also relevant. These include developing clear processes for identifying, reviewing, and filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), which are essential for maintaining regulatory compliance.

For Web3 startups operating internationally, compliance with regulatory standards across all jurisdictions is imperative. This includes adhering to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations and other international guidelines. By ensuring global compliance, Web3 founders can mitigate risks associated with cross-border operations and build a robust foundation for sustainable growth.

“There are more requirements depending on which country the exchange is operating. These are just general things that need to be done. I would advise having a strong legal team that truly understands how crypto works and that investigates in depth its regulation according to each country,” Fiorentini told BeInCrypto.

Collaborative efforts with regulatory bodies can significantly enhance the compliance capabilities of Web3 startups. Global cooperation among regulatory and enforcement agencies is essential for combating cross-border crypto scams and tracking down perpetrators. 
Encouraging the development of industry standards and best practices for transparency, security, and customer protection can also foster a more secure and reliable cryptocurrency market.

Emphasizing Education and Awareness
Education and awareness campaigns are crucial for protecting investors and maintaining market integrity. These campaigns should inform investors about the risks of cryptocurrency investments, how to spot scams and the importance of due diligence. 
Establishing easy-to-use reporting mechanisms for suspected frauds and scams can ensure swift action and protect investor interests. 

“Educational campaigns and reporting mechanisms are essential… Investors need to understand the risks and how to navigate them,” Fiorentini emphasized. 


The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is evolving, with a trend toward greater clarity, stricter compliance, enhanced consumer protection, and international coordination. Although challenging for some market participants, these regulatory adjustments are crucial for the long-term sustainability and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency industry.

“While the details and pace of these changes will vary across jurisdictions, the overall direction indicates a maturing market that is increasingly integrated into the global financial system,” Fiorentini concluded. 

In conclusion, Web3 founders must adopt comprehensive strategies to effectively navigate the US crypto crackdown. By implementing robust compliance frameworks, building investor confidence, and ensuring international compliance, Web3 startups can thrive and contribute to the maturation of the global cryptocurrency market.

5 Best Crypto Traders to Follow in June 2024


The crypto market is not an easy-to-navigate space, considering the barrage of ongoing developments and changing conditions. 
During this hour, traders who have experienced the space’s ups and downs tend to be helpful. BeInCrypto has compiled a list of individuals you could benefit from, too.
Scott Melker – The Wolf of All Streets

Scott Melker, also known by his alias, The Wolf of All Streets, is one of the biggest crypto traders and influencers. His knowledge, however, is not constrained to just the crypto market; he also draws influence from the financial market.
Although Melker does not have a bias toward an asset, his most recent Bitcoin prediction suggests a bullish outcome. Per his post, BTC is likely headed towards $74,000, enabling the crypto asset to post a new ATH.

Dan Gambardello 


Dan Gambardello, a trader and the founder of Crypto Capital Venture is known for being an avid Cardano supporter. However, his analysis is not limited to Cardano; it also focuses on BTC and other altcoins.
His recent analysis of the dominance of Bitcoin over altcoins suggests that the alt season could begin soon. Gambardello stated,

“Altcoins should soon be getting ready to make their move and BTC dominance should begin falling, in between now & August.”


CJ

CJ, who has the least amount of followers on this list, is still a very well-known trader. Accurate analysis and predictions of Bitcoin and altcoins have placed CJ on the list of must-follow traders.
CJ recently highlighted that Solana maxis will likely be disappointed by his prediction of an ETH/SOL chart on the daily timeframe. The chart formed a falling wedge, which is known to be a bullish reversal pattern.
This suggests a bullish outcome for Ethereum but a bearish outcome for Solana.


Benjamin Cowen

Benjamin Cowen, another well-known trader in the crypto market, runs multiple high-profile newsletters covering the range of crypto, Stocks, and the macro-financial market. This range of knowledge enabled CowenCowen to make predictions of the macro-financial space with the help of historical cues.
A recent analysis from Cowen suggested that rate cuts from the Federal Reserve could be around the corner. He stated,

“Last cycle, we saw the Fed cut rates 1 month after ALT/BTC pairs broke down. ALT/BTC pairs broke down in June 2019 and then the Fed cut in July. Now we are already hearing chatter from the ECB about rate cuts, maybe the Fed is not going to be too far behind?”



Rekt Capital


Crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital is not only a well-known influencer but also one of the most accurate in terms of prediction. Rekt Capital primarily predicts and analyzes Bitcoin but frequently features altcoins.
The most recent analyses from Rekt Capital highlighted a bullish outcome for Bitcoin’s price. With BTC closing in on $70,000, the analysts suggest a breakdown is unlikely.

Hey regulators, here’s how to get crypto right - Blockworks


In the United States, the understandable doom and gloom around the regulatory environment has put a pall on much of the enthusiasm in the crypto industry. The Gensler SEC seems to be lashing out at the biggest players in the market with Wells notices sent to Uniswap, Consensys and Robinhood. 
But, as the meme goes: Touch grass.
For crypto regulatory lawyers, this means getting out of the United States. I had the good fortune a few weeks ago to be able to travel to Dubai and Bangkok for a series of crypto conferences. And the mood in those markets is very different: The vibe in MENA and APAC around regulatory frameworks is really positive. The regulators there are clearly taking a different approach to crypto.
Many in crypto (especially in the United States) feel that markets are either pro-crypto or anti-crypto — but regulators don’t think that way. Instead, most regulators are thoughtful and careful when approaching a new industry like the digital assets markets. But what does that mean in practice?
Let’s take a look at a couple of jurisdictions that I think are coming closest to getting it right.
Abu Dhabi Global Market approach to digital asset regulation
In Dubai, just before Token2049, Centrifuge co-hosted the first in a series of five Real World Asset (RWA) Summit events held across the globe. One of our speakers was Wai Lum Kwok from the Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM) Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA).
And Kwok made a great point: It is much easier for smaller markets to embrace innovation than bigger markets. Regulators like the FRSA or the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) have less political pressure and less vested interests to manage. Their approaches can be adapted more quickly; they can be more flexible.
Flexibility is the crucial point. Crypto markets move fast. Innovation is happening every day. No regulator has the resources to match a global industry based on developing technology — and nowhere is that more the case than with RWAs, considering how it sits right on the edge between TradFi and DeFi. 
Regulatory frameworks need to have flexibility built in. This works better in principles-based regimes rather than rules-based regimes. A principles-based regime moves away from reliance on prescriptive rules, instead assessing projects on the basis of high-level principles. As with the ADGM, these principles should be broad-based and outcomes-based. This then allows the regulator to assess projects and applicants on the basis of whether their activities are designed to achieve certain results, rather than whether it fits into a box of existing rules or not.
Back to Abu Dhabi: The ADGM FRSA takes a risk-based approach based on regulatory clarity. Its advantages in terms of sophistication and resources are readily apparent, and the support and backing of a business-friendly ecosystem is very important.
Too often, crypto projects (and crypto lawyers!) look solely at the laws and rules and do not focus sufficiently on the service providers and their rules and risk appetites. Without a supportive ecosystem, projects can fail — even if all the regulatory boxes have been checked.
Thailand’s regulatory framework for digital assets
Similar to the ADGM FRSA, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission has taken important steps to create a comprehensive digital assets regulatory framework that balances investor protection with the promotion of innovation. 
Thailand was one of the earliest jurisdictions to opt for a bespoke framework treating digital assets as a new asset class. The regulators that tried or are trying to shoehorn digital assets into existing regulatory frameworks have found it difficult. Crypto markets are too innovative to fit into historical TradFi rules.
Read more from our opinion section: Why crypto matters: Foundations of a free and prosperous society
Thailand recognized this very early with the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses coming into force in May 2018. Just as importantly, the Thai SEC continues to develop new rules with an important set of amendments becoming effective from Jan. 16, 2024.
It shouldn’t need to be said, but it is significant to note that these regimes are not designed to simply greenlight digital asset projects.
These are rigorous frameworks applied consistently and effectively by well-resourced, experienced staff. It is not sufficient to simply put the framework in place. The teams need to be trained to efficiently enforce the rules.
Key elements of effective crypto regulation
In sum, in my view the key elements of effective crypto regulation are:

A comprehensive, tailor-made, principles-based digital asset regulatory framework;
A commitment to continually develop, adapt and modify the regime as innovation and technology progresses;
A sophisticated, friendly, energetic and resourced staff that is delegated sufficient flexibility to address license applications with a risk-based approach;
A clear and uniformly applied enforcement mechanism to prevent fraud and unauthorized regulated activity.

I know it is not in their nature, but US legislators and regulators could learn a lot by researching the digital asset regulatory regimes in MENA, APAC and elsewhere that have gotten it right. Maybe then the ongoing discussions on legislative changes in the US could proceed from a solid basis toward a satisfactory conclusion.

Uniswap Vote Delay Shows DeFi Stakeholders Aren't All in It Together

Talks again arose about fee switch activation with the launch of Uniswap V3. GFX Labs, maker of the Oku, a front end interface for Uniswap, proposed a plan that would test out the protocol fee distribution on a few pools on Uniswap V2 that received a lot of attention. But talks ultimately fizzled out, due in part to concerns that activation might drive LPs and liquidity away from the platform, as well as legal fears.

Bank Employee Banned From Industry After Allegedly Stealing $15,000 From Lender, Hiding Paper Trail With Rotten Receipts - The Daily Hodl


								The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is taking action against a former bank employee for allegedly stealing thousands of dollars in just one week.
The OCC says it’s issuing an order of prohibition against Sabrina Prince for violations of law that resulted in unjust enrichment at the expense of PNC Bank.










Between May 24th and May 31st of 2023, the OCC says Prince, who was at the time working as a teller at a PNC Bank Alabama branch, allegedly stole $15,000 in cash from her employer.
Prince is accused of modifying the bank’s cash shipment processing receipts in an effort to conceal the missing funds.
According to the OCC, PNC Bank bore financial losses as a result of Prince’s personal dishonesty.
In a consent order, the regulator bans Prince from working at insured institutions including banks and credit unions. She’s also barred from working at any federal depository regulatory agency, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and any Federal Home Loan Bank.
Prince has agreed to the OCC’s findings and order without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.
The OCC says other US federal agencies such as the Department of Justice (DOJ) can still file complaints against Prince even though she agreed to the stipulations of the consent order.

Solana secures 'big three' status with PYUSD expansion, say industry experts - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Last week, PayPal announced the expansion of its stablecoin PYSUD to Solana, marking the first move beyond the Ethereum blockchain. Industry players shared with Crypto Briefing that this movement solidifies Solana as one of the ‘big three’ blockchains, highlighting that the blockchain and institutions make sense.Ran Goldi, VP of Payments at Fireblocks, points out that Solana is now “harvesting the fruits” of the work done for the past three years. He adds that Solana’s infrastructure allows payment companies to leverage its blockchain to mimic their existing flows and operations while offering new payment constructs and attributes to unlock new abilities.
“Their recent adoption by PayPal and Visa are far from surprising, and I believe that with confidential transfers, a basic payment requirement for large volume processors, we will see additional names adopting the blockchain into their flows. The key, as I see it, is making sure your blockchain can support the ‘under the hood’ payment requirements for compliance, regulation, and privacy. Doing that, plus speed and vast liquidity, can become a sharp tool in the hands of payment institutions,” Goldi stated. 
Moreover, the move by PayPal adds traction to the potential of Solana becoming a blockchain for merchant and institutional adoption, said Tristan Frizza, founder of Zeta Markets. He mentions the previous Solana partnerships with Visa, Stripe, and Shopify Pay.
“Solana is seen as one of the ‘big three’ cryptos alongside BTC and ETH, with many analysts expecting a Solana ETF soon. Solana is one of the fastest-growing blockchains in terms of usage, users, transactions, and volume. This growth reinforces the belief that Solana will be the backbone of the future internet, creating a cycle of increased institutional, retail, and developer activity. While institutional adoption is still in its early stages, these signs are promising for further acceptance and integration,” Frizza assessed.
Solana’s relationship with institutions was also highlighted by Robinson Burkey, CCO and co-founder of Wormhole Foundation. As traditional payment players need to make their offerings future-proof, the implementation of Solana “makes sense.”
“The best way to do that is by meeting their most forward-thinking users on the platforms they’re adopting. You’ll likely see many more institutional moments for Solana in the coming years,” Burkey added.
Matty Taylor, the co-founder of Colosseum, also sees the deployment of PYSUD on Solana as a “massive validation for all of the work the ecosystem has put in over the last year.” Nevertheless, he points out that this is just the tip of the iceberg.

Ethereum ETF Approval Political Narrative Looks 'Less Credible': Bernstein - Benzinga

The idea that a political shift led to the SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs last month has been called into question after President Joe Biden vetoed a bill aimed at overturning SAB 121.What Happened: According to research from brokerage firm Bernstein, this recent veto undermines the notion of a political change influencing the SEC’s decision, The Block reported.In May, both the House and Senate voted to repeal the SEC's staff accounting bulletin, SAB 121. This bulletin set accounting standards for crypto custodians, making it impractical for Wall Street banks to hold crypto assets for clients. President Biden's veto of this repeal indicates a continued stance on strict crypto regulation, with Biden stating, “My Administration will not support measures that jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors.”Former President Donald Trump recently expressed strong support for cryptocurrencies, even hosting an event for his Trump "Mugshot" NFTs and promising to support crypto self-custody and oppose central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). His actions and statements led some to believe that the approval of Ethereum ETFs indicated a broader policy shift in favor of crypto.Also Read: Donald Trump’s Crypto Wallet Grows By $500K In Value Following TrialHowever, analysts from Bernstein, including Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra, argue that the SEC’s approval of Ethereum ETFs was more likely a pragmatic decision to avoid legal conflicts, rather than a result of political influence. The SEC, facing similar regulatory frameworks for both Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD ETFs, likely sought to avoid another legal battle, particularly after Grayscale won its case against the SEC regarding the conversion of its GBTC Bitcoin Trust to a spot Bitcoin ETF.This perspective is supported by Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, who noted that Biden's veto reinforces the idea that the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs was not politically driven. “The SEC didn’t want to get sued and lose again,” Geraci commented, adding that the case for approval was straightforward.For more insights into the evolving digital assets landscape and regulatory developments, industry leaders will gather at the Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.

Dogecoin Creator: Crypto Market A Playground For Posers


								The dazzling world of cryptocurrency has come under fire from within, with prominent figures calling the current market a breeding ground for speculation and potential manipulation. The finger-pointing comes amidst a surge in popularity of meme coins – cryptocurrencies inspired by internet jokes and pop culture – raising questions about the market’s focus on fundamentals versus pure hype.





This dichotomy in the market is crucial to consider in the context of Bitcoin’s predicted rise. While Bitcoin benefits from a strong foundation and widespread acceptance, the overarching speculative environment can introduce volatility and unpredictability.
Is The Crypto Market A ‘Rigged Casino’?




It’s like a “rigged casino”, with new, unproven projects popping up every day, declared Nate Alex, a popular NFT artist and collector, in a recent interview. Alex wasn’t mincing words, accusing the market of prioritizing “onboarding retail investors so insiders can profit by selling scamcoins.”
His scathing remarks resonated with Billy Markus, co-creator of Dogecoin, the original meme coin. Markus echoed Alex’s concerns, suggesting the market has become a playground for people pretending to be smarter than they are.


The Popularity Of Memecoins
The crux of their argument lies in the recent explosion of meme coins like PEPE and BONK. These lighthearted tokens, often lacking a clear purpose beyond their meme-based origins, have garnered significant attention, particularly on the Solana blockchain.
The emergence of memecoins presents a unique challenge for investors. While some view them as a lighthearted and potentially lucrative way to participate in the crypto space, others warn of their inherent risks.

As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com
Their value hinges heavily on community sentiment and social media trends, making them susceptible to sudden crashes. The lack of underlying utility further increases the risk of them being nothing more than a fad.
This trend has overshadowed established projects with robust underlying technology and functionalities. The consequence? Prices for these more fundamental projects remain stagnant, while meme coin valuations often soar – at least temporarily. Dogecoin itself, the undisputed king of meme coins, seems to be losing its crown, failing to capitalize on the current meme craze.

An Interesting Twist
In spite of the critical disapproval, Alex – the very person comparing the market to a rigged casino – is still a major bitcoin investor. According to reports, he thinks the market will rise further, if only through the remainder of the year.

‘Inevitable’ - Tether Co-Founder Says China Is Going To Open Up to Crypto: Report - The Daily Hodl


								The co-founder of Tether (USDT), the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap, reportedly says it’s “inevitable” that China will reverse course and open up to crypto assets.
According to a new report by the South China Morning Post, Tether co-founder Brock Pierce says that China – which banned all crypto-related commercial activity years ago – will eventually recognize digital assets as legitimate.










 “Is China going to open up [to cryptocurrencies]? … I’d say it’s inevitable. The question is not so much if, it’s a matter of when.” 
Pierce goes on to note that he’s also interested in Hong Kong as its financial authority, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), recently passed clear crypto guidelines for investors, also pointing out the region has potential in trade finance (tradefi).
“I think Hong Kong is ahead in many ways. I think the main opportunity in Hong Kong is in tradefi and that’s where a Hong Kong digital dollar stablecoin has tremendous potential.” 
Pierce’s comments come as many crypto exchange platforms with ties to mainland China looking to become licensed in Hong Kong withdrew their applications due to regulations introduced last year by the SFC.
According to the report, last week, the SFC said that digital asset exchanges licensed in Hong Kong should not be serving citizens of mainland China.

JOJO Exchange debuts zk-proofs to enhance on-chain derivatives - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Decentralized exchange for perpetuals trading (perp DEX) JOJO implemented zero-knowledge proof (zk-proofs) technology for funding rates in their platform to keep perpetual contracts aligned with the spot market prices. According to Jotaro Kujo, JOJO’s co-founder, this is a fundamental development for on-chain derivatives trading.JOJO tapped into Brevis zk-proofs technology, which is a coprocessor able to read from and utilize the full historical on-chain data from any chain, and run customizable computations in a completely trust-free way.
“With Brevis’ zk-proofs, we have the ability to do any calculation based on the transactions, the events, on any block time in any timeframe, and generate proofs validated on-chain. It’s pretty suitable for us because we have a very open liquidity layer, which means that people can build different liquidity structures on top of JOJO and they may also have their own impact on the price. That means if you calculate our rates on-chain, will be a very hard work to do,” explained Jotaro.
Therefore, zk-proofs allow JOJO to calculate the funding rates off-chain and register them on-chain, avoiding the very demanding process of calculating it. The result is an “efficient and secure” solution to the industry.On-chain derivatives monthly trading volume. Image: DefiLlamaThis development by JOJO and Brevis is important given the importance of funding rates to the design of perpetual contracts, highlighted Jotaro. Funding rates keep the perpetual contracts’ prices tied to the spot market, making them more accurate for traders. 
“When our perpetual contract has a higher price than the spot, the funding rate will charge from the long positions and pay to the short positions. So that creates an incentive for people to close their long positions and open short positions. That means people will sell the perpetual contract and start to buy, dumping the price and making the perpetual price back to the same as the spot price.”
Consequently, this mechanism encourages the arbitrageurs and the traders to make de perpetual price keep following the spot price. Without a funding rate, the perpetual contract is “just a shitcoin” and doesn’t make sense, added Jotaro.Despite a monthly 23% fall, the trading volume of on-chain derivatives is still at its highest levels. The gradual growth of this decentralized finance sector depends on capital efficiency, Jotaro stated, and developments such as accurate funding rates are one of the fundamental contributions to this industry’s expansion.
“The funding rate is very important for decentralized exchanges, and we need to calculate it efficiently, but at the same time in a safe way. And now we see a lot of other exchanges showing that they calculate the final rate by centralized oracles. Well, that is not the right way to do it, although they may have faced some temporary difficulties with the on-chain calculation. We think this zk-proof model can make the on-chain derivatives advance a lot, so we can make it verifiable by anyone.”

Top Analyst Explains Why He Is Buying These 5 Altcoins


In the wake of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approval, top analyst Michaël van de Poppe is bullish on five specific altcoins and predicts substantial returns. 
This landmark event has spurred interest across the Ethereum ecosystem, setting the stage for an altcoin season. Here is a look at the altcoins van de Poppe is eyeing to buy, each chosen for their potential to yield significant gains.
1. Optimism (OP) 
Optimism, a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is the first altcoin on the list. With Ethereum’s price surge, platforms enhancing its efficiency are expected to thrive. 
This Layer-2 network utilizes roll-up technology to batch transactions, reducing costs and increasing speed. Michaël van de Poppe highlighted its impressive total value locked (TVL) ratio, indicating robust ecosystem growth. Optimism’s low circulating supply further enhances its bullish outlook.

“I think that a coin like Optimism can do between, I would say, 300% to 800% in BTC value in the coming six months. I think that’s very likely and that’s probably the first run,” van de Poppe said.

2. Arbitrum (ARB) 
Next is Arbitrum, another Layer-2 solution competing closely with Optimism. It leverages zero-knowledge rollups, a technology providing faster and more secure transaction processing. 

Despite its price struggles, Arbitrum’s ecosystem shows strong development momentum. Van de Poppe believes its substantial TVL and ongoing advancements make it a solid investment, poised for a significant rebound.

“If you look at the TVL of this Arbitrum, it’s almost the exact same amount as the market capitalization. So that is super bullish as the ecosystem is also growing. But once we look at the price action, it is garbage,” van de Poppe added.

3. Woo Network (WOO) 
Woo Network, a decentralized exchange (DEX) known for its high liquidity and low fees, is another altcoin van de Poppe plans to buy. 
In the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, DEXs are gaining traction due to increasing regulatory pressures on centralized exchanges. Woo Network’s technological advantages and growing user base position it well for growth, particularly as trading volumes on Ethereum continue to rise.

“Once Ethereum starts to do well and the volumes are already waking up, this is where WOO comes in. There’s also a revenue being made so that is why I think it’s a great one to have. I think when the whole cycle starts for WOO, it can actually yield between 500% to 1,500%,” van de Poppe explained.

4. Wormhole (W) 
Wormhole, a bridge protocol for interoperability between blockchains, ranks fourth. As the DeFi landscape expands, seamless asset transfers across different blockchains are critical.
Its innovative solutions facilitate this cross-chain communication, making it an attractive investment. Although relatively new, its potential for widespread adoption and integration into various blockchain ecosystems is high.

“I want to bet on safe Solana (SOL) solutions. The only tricky part with Wormhole is the fact that there are still unlocks, but these unlocks are going to take some time so that’s why I think that this one is going to do really well,” van de Poppe added.

5. Dogecoin (DOGE) 

Finally, Dogecoin, a well-known meme coin, remains a favorite. Despite its volatility, Dogecoin’s community support and recent price performance make it a viable short-term play. 
Michaël van de Poppe sees it as a high-risk, high-reward asset, especially amid a broader crypto market upswing.

“Whether you like it or not, you see all the meme coins doing well. Floki, Book of Meme, Bonk. All of those meme coins are doing well. This is the time when you want to get yourself into a position of Dogecoin. It’s the easiest one. It will do a 4x to 5x or maybe even more,” van de Poppe concluded.

These altcoins are selected based on their technological strengths, market positioning, and potential for high returns. However, it is essential to approach these investments with caution, given the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

Recent Filings Reveal Wisconsin's Pension Fund Has Invested in Spot Bitcoin ETFs | Cryptoglobe


                                
On May 15, Markets Insider reported that the state of Wisconsin made a significant foray into the cryptocurrency market by purchasing $163 million worth of Bitcoin during the first quarter of the year. This investment, documented in a 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marks a notable moment for institutional investment in digital assets.



The Wisconsin Investment Board, which oversees the state’s $150 billion pension fund, has allocated approximately $38 billion in public stocks as of 31 March. The recent filing revealed that the board acquired over 1 million shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust valued at $63.7 million and around 2.5 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust worth $99.2 million. This strategic move positions Wisconsin as one of the pioneering state pension funds to embrace the crypto space.



Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, highlighted the significance of this development, noting that state pension funds typically wait longer before engaging in new ETF markets. He emphasized that the early adoption by Wisconsin’s pension fund could signal a trend, with more institutions likely to follow. 







In a follow-up to this news, on May 31, Frederica Freyberg of PBS Wisconsin interviewed David Krause, an Emeritus Associate Professor of Finance and the inaugural director of the Applied Investment Management (AIM) program at Marquette University. Krause offered his perspective on the investment, noting that the move surprised many in the investment community due to its timing shortly after the approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC on January 10.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Krause explained that spot Bitcoin ETFs allows institutions like the Wisconsin Investment Board to invest directly in regulated, highly liquid securities traded on exchanges. Despite the initial surprise, he acknowledged Wisconsin’s history of innovative investment strategies, supported by its fully funded pension status. This financial stability gives the state the flexibility to pursue long-term investments without the immediate liquidity concerns faced by underfunded pensions.



Addressing concerns about Bitcoin’s volatility, Krause pointed out that many assets within pension fund portfolios are inherently volatile. He emphasized that Bitcoin’s supply and demand dynamics are becoming more balanced, making it a viable alternative investment. Krause also noted that the pension fund’s Bitcoin investment is relatively small, representing just 0.1% of the total fund. This cautious entry allows the board to gauge public and market reactions before making more substantial allocations.



Krause highlighted the diversification benefits of including Bitcoin in the pension fund’s portfolio. Bitcoin’s lack of correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds can enhance portfolio diversification, potentially increasing returns while mitigating risks. Additionally, he said, Bitcoin’s limited supply could serve as an effective hedge against inflation.



Looking ahead, Krause expects other state pension funds to closely monitor Wisconsin’s experience with Bitcoin. He believes that well-funded pension systems may follow suit, while those with lower liquidity might refrain from such long-term investments. Krause also remarked that Wisconsin’s investment could legitimize Bitcoin in the eyes of other institutional investors, as evidenced by the immediate 1% increase in Bitcoin’s price following the public disclosure of the SEC filing.

How a money launderer allegedly used Deltec, Binance, and Tether


Daren Li was recently indicted in the Central District of California on a charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Li is allegedly the mastermind behind a money-laundering syndicate that was moving funds for ‘pig-butchering’ scams. 
The scammers allegedly used fake versions of CoinZoom and Crypto.Com to convince victims to transfer funds.
Often, the victims were induced to send funds to bank accounts of shell corporations set up by the scammers; these corporations include entities like CMD Export and Import. 

The indictment describes two accounts held at a bank in the Bahamas. One of these accounts was opened by Li’s co-conspirators in Los Angeles, with Li providing funds to help open it.
The other received approximately $35.4 million from victims of the scam. After victims’ funds were transferred to this bank, they were converted to USDT and moved to Li’s account at Binance.
Besides those in the Bahamas, the syndicate relied on other banks, including Evolve Bank and Trust. This Evolve account was controlled by another shell corporation, Jingshun International Corporation, and funds at Evolve were subsequently transferred to Wise. 
The indictment also references the fact that co-conspirators were indicted at the end of last year. It details a case covering the Sea Dragon entities and discusses funds the alleged money launderers had in a Deltec Bank account at Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFJ) Trust and Banking Corporation. The funds were transferred from a Bank of America account to this MUFJ account.
The affidavit in support of the seizure suggests that Deltec Bank misrepresented the purpose of this account to MUFJ. 

Blockchain Analysis of Daren Li
The indictment describes how funds tracked in this scheme were withdrawn from a Binance account in Li’s name to an address described in the indictment as the ‘TRteo Address.’
A review of Tron blockchain data reveals that the only address that meets the description in the indictment is TRteottJGH5caJyy9qFuM8EJJGGCpDaxx6. According to the affidavit, “Li and/or his co-conspirators” are most likely in control of this address.
A closer review of this address gives us greater insight into the counterparties for this syndicate, including Binance, FTX, and Kraken. 
The Li address received funds from six addresses that Breadcrumbs labeled as Binance.
The Li address received slightly less than $29 million in USDT from TTd9qHyjqiUkfTxe3gotbuTMpjU8LEbpkN, an address that both Breadcrumbs and Tronscan have labeled as Kraken. The last transaction with this Kraken address occurred approximately a year ago, in June of 2023.
The Li address also received slightly over $6 million in USDT from TYDzsYUEpvnYmQk4zGP9sWWcTEd2MiAtW6, an address that Breadcrumbs and Tronscan have labeled as FTX. The last transaction was a couple of weeks before FTX declared bankruptcy.
Binance was probably the most important identifiable exchange that the Li address interacted with. It received funds from six addresses that Breadcrumbs labeled as Binance and a total of approximately $28 million in USDT. Additionally, the Li address received approximately 100k TRX from Binance addresses.
These various transactions show how money launderers in the ecosystem rely on transferring funds between a variety of different financial institutions and crypto institutions to try to obscure the flows of criminal activities.

Linea Halts Network after Velocore Exploit - The Defiant

Decentralized exchange Velocore was hacked for $7M over the weekend.Ethereum Layer 2 network Linea, developed by Consensys, said it stopped block production due to a security breach at Velocore, a decentralized exchange (DEX) on its network.On June 1, a hacker managed to exploit Velocore and steal $7 million of assets before moving 700 ETH (approximately $2.7 million) off the network using a third-party bridge. To prevent the attacker from bridging more assets, Linea halted the sequencer, its system for processing transactions.According to Linea, its attempts to contact the Velocore team were unsuccessful, prompting the decision to pause block production."The sequencer was paused from block 5081800 and 5081801. During this pause, we gave the Velocore team time to support their efforts of triaging the vulnerability," explained Linea. "We also censored the hacker’s addresses. This significantly reduced the ecosystem impact on Linea users."The drastic measure was taken because the hacker had begun to sell large amounts of stolen tokens for ETH, which could have caused additional fallout across the ecosystem. Linea said that halting the sequencer was necessary to protect the network's users.Aftermath of the exploitVelocore said it is working with external networks to reimburse impacted victims. Data from DefiLlama shows the total value locked (TVL) in Velocore crashed on Sunday from $9.2 million to less than $1 million following the hack.The hack also significantly impacted Linea's network activity. According to data from Dappradar, transactions on Linea dropped by 23% to 261,000 on June 2.Meanwhile, Linea's active address count decreased by 14% from 479,000 to 409,000 in just 24 hours, data from Growthepie shows.Community CriticismHowever, critics argue that Linea's actions violate the principles of decentralization, a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency industry.Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius Labs, criticized the move."Consensys’ L2 unilaterally turned off the chain yesterday,” he said. “While it may have been reasonable given the circumstances, it clearly shows that this is not crypto.""There’s a place for centralized crypto to reduce costs between known parties, like in supply chain blockchain," said Matthew Gould, founder of Unstoppable Domains. "However, I don’t think Linea is trying to be that."Echoing these concerns, Alex Gluchowski, CEO of Matter Labs, stressed the necessity of decentralization in Layer 2 solutions. "Decentralizing the sequencer isn’t optional. Every serious L2 stack must prioritize this," he asserted.In response to the backlash, Linea said it's moving towards a decentralized network to prevent similar incidents in the future."When our network matures to a decentralized, censorship-resistant environment, Linea’s team will no longer have the ability to halt block production and censor addresses," the project said.

Bitcoin, Ethereum Funds Attract Another $185 Million Amid ETH ETF Hype - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin and Ethereum investment funds continue to draw a flood of capital as excitement builds for upcoming ETH spot ETFs in the United States.Global Bitcoin investment funds saw net inflows totaling $148 million last week, according to a Monday post from CoinShares, while short Bitcoin products experienced outflows of $3.5 million.Meanwhile, Ethereum funds absorbed $33.5 million, marking a second consecutive week of inflows following several months of little to no net activity for the asset.“This represents a turnaround in investor sentiment in an asset that had seen a 10-week run of outflows prior, totaling $200 million,” the asset manager explained. The news also boosted Solana’s inflows last week to $5.8 million, now that potential ETFs for Solana and other altcoins appear to be on the table.While most inflows across the board came from the United States, substantial crypto flows were also seen in Canada and Switzerland, where Ethereum's institutional dominance next to Bitcoin is relatively high.Experts expect Ethereum ETFs to go live in July, with the potential to draw in about 20% of the same demand as Bitcoin ETFs. “Grabbing 20% of what they got would be a huge win/successful launch by normal ETF standards,” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote last week.In total, inflows of crypto investment funds worldwide took in $185 million last week, bringing their tally above $15 billion year to date. Volume on the week was $8 billion, down from $13 billion the week prior, per CoinShares.As usual, most inflows went to the largest new Bitcoin spot ETFs, with BlackRock and Fidelity’s funds soaking in $297 million and $176.98 million respectively. That said, “incumbent” ETF issuers saw net outflows of $260 million, virtually all of which came from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).Last week marked a pivotal moment for GBTC, with the long-standing fund losing its status as the world’s largest Bitcoin ETF to BlackRock, whose product charges a much lower management fee. Other incumbent ETFs worldwide have also lost big since BlackRock entered the picture, with European funds experiencing $500 million in outflows since the start of the year.As of May 27, Bitcoin spot ETFs also crossed the threshold of controlling 1 million BTC under management.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

“Wisconsin’s investment board has always been innovative,” he said. “This is a fully funded pension fund so in a way, they have the luxury of being able to invest for the long term. They don’t need to worry as much about liquidity as, say, the pension fund for the state of Illinois, which is only funded at 50% of its level,” he added.

Ripple's XRP Price Rocket To $10 Looking Likely In This Scenario Amid $3 Trillion XRP Market Outlook ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
XRP, the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been experiencing a period of sideways trading, with its volatility subdued in recent months.



This comes as the crypto market witnesses a surge in interest, particularly with the rise of meme coin Dogecoin, which has surpassed industry stalwarts like Cardano. Despite the current lull, pundits forecast a significant upturn for XRP in the second half of 2024.



In a recent post on X, analyst Egrag Crypto highlighted the potential for a remarkable surge in XRP’s market capitalization before the end of the year.



“Once XRP Market Capitalization (MC) blasts out of ‘The White Channel,’ we’re looking at a moonshot to a $3T market cap. The mid-point of the channel is $100B, and the high-end reaches $287B. This is where XRP MC will propel like a rocket!” Wrote the pundit, urging the XRP community to stay ready.







On the other hand, Matthew Dixon, CEO of AI-based crypto investment firm Evai, stated he anticipates a minor pullback before a substantial rally in the C wave, cautioning about the pre-terminal nature of triangle patterns in technical analysis.

&nbsp



“XRP rally correlates with solid positivity across most Crypto. But if the triangle interpretation is correct, remember, Triangles are pre-terminal waves followed by an aggressive terminal thrust (C wave).” He stated.







After analyzing a triangle pattern, analyst “JacktheRippler” predicted an end to XRP’s accumulation phase, suggesting a price pump to $5-$10 per XRP. Such a surge would represent approximately a 1,800% increase from current prices.



However, despite these optimistic forecasts, concerns persist regarding Ripple’s token sales. Ripple plans to sell 400 million XRP in June, marking the largest token sale in seven years. With Ripple holding significant XRP reserves, including 40.1 billion in escrow, ongoing sell-offs could negatively impact price movements.



Moreover, the lingering legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been a persistent drag on XRP’s price for the past four years. While the court ruled last May that XRP is not a security, a potential settlement later this year could boost the cryptocurrency’s value.



At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5195, reflecting a modest 1.26% gain over the past 24 hours. However, trading volume surged by 61.54% during the same period, indicating a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency despite the current price stagnation.

Are Bitcoin Bulls Preparing to Break $74,000? Here's What On-chain Data Says


								At spot rates, Bitcoin is resilient, soaking in selling pressure and bouncing off the 20-day moving average, as evident in the daily chart. As BTC floats above $69,000, it appears that bulls are preparing for even more gains in the days ahead. 
For now, BTC has a strong rejection at $72,000. However, if this level is broken, the coin might easily break all-time highs and chart to fresh territory in Q2 2024.
Speculators Are Flowing Back: Will Bitcoin Extend Gains?
Citing on-chain developments, one analyst predicts that the coin might register higher highs in the days ahead. The analyst pointed out the behavior of short-term BTC holders, observing that their behavior could suggest that more is yet to come. 
New investors buying BTC | Source: @AxelAdlerJr via X
So far, the realized market cap for investors holding Bitcoin for one month or less has been picking up momentum and rising. Historically, when this metric rises, as in 2020, it could signal that the market is preparing to head higher, driven by an influx of fresh capital. 

Usually, the realized market cap is used to gauge sentiment. It measures the value of BTC in circulation based on its acquisition price. In the above case, the realized market cap of all BTC acquired in less than one month is rising, suggesting that more people are buying, confident of what lies ahead.
As short-term holders double down, other metrics show that their realized profit is down by 32%. This reduction indicates that holders are not rushing to lock in profits by selling at current prices.
 Instead, they are ready to HODL, anticipating further price gains in the future. This bullish sentiment points to an improving market sentiment, reinforcing the positive outlook.
Bitcoin Volatility Incoming? Roadblock At $72,000
As short-term holders flow back, there is a noticeable spike in BTC transfers from spot to derivatives exchanges.

According to the analyst, this emerging trend suggests that more investors, mostly whales, are beginning to take on leveraged positions, placing BTC as a margin. Their engagement could lead to more volatility, which benefits speculators. 

Though on-chain metrics point to confidence, it remains to be seen how prices will pan out in the days ahead. For now, the immediate liquidation line is at $72,000.

As Bitcoin bounces from the middle BB, confirming June 3 gains is necessary for trend continuation. A convincing close above $72,000 would accelerate the leg up, possibly driving the coin above $74,000.

CryptoQuant CEO Says Bitcoin (BTC) Flashing Mid-2020 Vibes - Here’s What He Means - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant says that Bitcoin’s (BTC) on-chain market structure looks similar to 2020 before its bull market finale.
Ki Young Ju tells his 346,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s current price action is reminiscent of four years ago when BTC consolidated for over half a year while on-chain activity rose rapidly.










Ju says that $1 billion in BTC has been added to whale wallets, which is most likely headed off-market to cold storage.
“Same vibe on Bitcoin as mid-2020.
Back then, BTC hovered around $10,000 for six months with high on-chain activity, later revealed as OTC (over-the-counter) deals.
Now, despite low price volatility, on-chain activity remains high, with $1 billion added daily to new whale wallets, likely custody.”
Source: Ki Young Ju/X
Ju also shares a chart showing the “holding intensity” of Bitcoin holders. He says the metric aims to indicate how closely the holding behavior of Bitcoin matches the scenario where every coin remains unmoved.
The chart shows a steady uptrend of holding intensity over the last 14 years, which the analyst says is a reflection of how investors increasingly look at BTC as a long-term store of value.
“Bitcoin holders are increasingly inclined to hold rather than sell. This suggests Bitcoin is now viewed more as a store of wealth than a trading asset.”
Source: Ki Young Ju/X
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $69,113.

Gamestop Hero ‘Roaring Kitty’ Posts $250,000,000 Gains After Risky Call Option Trades - The Daily Hodl


								The leader of the Gamestop (GME) short squeeze movement is sitting on potentially one of the best trades of all time shortly after his dramatic comeback to the public eye.
Keith Gill, who goes by ‘Roaring Kitty,’ is currently looking at hundreds of millions of dollars in gains after building a massive call option position in GME.










Yesterday, the legendary meme stock trader made his first post on Reddit under his username “DeepF**kingVallue” in over three years, revealing a call position initially worth $65 million.
“GME YOLO update – June 2, 2024”
Source: DeepF**kingValue/Reddit
According to stock and crypto market tools platform Unusual Whales, Gill’s GameStop calls were worth $250,000,000 early Monday morning.
“BREAKING: Roaring Kitty’s, aka DeepFuckingValue, had $65 million in GameStop, GME calls he revealed yesterday.
This morning at peak, those GME calls were worth $250 MILLION, a near $300% return.
…You can see it looks like he has not sold and is holding.”
Source: Unusual Whales/X
According to widely followed growth stock investor and podcaster Jonah Lupton, Gill may have briefly been up over $750 million at the time of market open.
“He probably sold all of his calls near the top and then started buying back GME equity which is why is cost basis is in the $20s.
Then he decided to play this game again, so over the past couple weeks he’s been selling his GME equity and loading up on the June 21st $20 calls.
With GME up 83% premarket, he’s up more than $95M on the equity and he’s probably up $450M+ on the calls so his account will probably be worth $750M+ after the open…
Never seen anything like this before.”
At time of publishing, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has halted trading on GME at least once due to volatility.
Gill’s return from his lengthy hiatus last month coincided with a massive GME rally and the emergence of a Solana-based GameStop-inspired memecoin.
GME – the memecoin on Solana – is up 124% in the last 24 hours, while the real GME on the NYSE is up about 50% on the day so far.

Why 'You Should Only Buy Bitcoin' And All Other Top 20 Cryptos Are 'Really Jokes,' According To This Trader - Benzinga

Bitcoin investor Fred Krueger pointed out why “you should only buy Bitcoin BTC/USD,” even though there have been significant changes in the top ten and top 20 of cryptocurrencies over the years. What Happened: In an extensive tweet on Monday, Krueger argued that all other cryptocurrencies in the top 20 are “a joke,” despite their combined market cap of over $500 billion. The analyst list includes Ethereum ETH/USD as an underperformer since 2019 when it touched 0.12 ETH /BTC and is now at 0.056 in the "falling channel." He cited that the SEC has multiple lawsuits against Ethereum in play. Tether USDT/USD is stable so there is no scope for an upside, but while interest rates are at 5%, it does not pay interest.BNB BNB/USD is termed a “highly centralized exchange coin,” with Binance in decline and former CEO Changpeng Zhao in prison. Solana SOL/USD is “a completely centralized meme coin factory” and is down 40% from Bitcoin since 2022. He also noted the problem of periodical shutdowns for system upgrades.Other cryptocurrencies Krueger dismissed include:
USDC USDC/USD: Depegged a few years ago.



Ripple XRP/USD: “No actual use.”



Toncoin TON/USD: Telegram coin which “nobody uses.” It also got in trouble with the SEC.



Cardano ADA/USD: “Nobody uses” this “useless coin” promoted by someone claiming, ‘Bitcoin won’t make it.’
Among meme coins, he terms Dogecoin DOGE/USD a literal joke with no redeeming features and no one using it. Shiba Inu SHIB/USD is a bad copy of Dogecoin and Pepe PEPE/USD is just a “$6 billion frog coin.”His tweet also highlighted Avalanche AVAX/USD as worthless, Chainlink LINK/USD as “just stupid for providing feeds” to Ethereum chains. He adds Polygon MATIC/USD as an Ethereum sidechain with “terrible tokenomics” and down 75% from the peak.Major crypto traders reacted to his viral tweet, with Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo tweeting that most of the cryptocurrencies have their main real case as "buying them" at the right time and stacking more Bitcoin. He adds, "USDT has been a past favorite of mine during crypto winter."What’s Next: Bitcoin and the rest of the 19 top cryptocurrencies will take center stage in discussions at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19. The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is also expected to be thoroughly explored.Read Next: Crypto Expert Reveals How To Find ‘High-Risk High Reward’ Meme CoinsImage: ShutterstockMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Data Revealed: Transactions in This Altcoin Are 505 Times Cheaper Than Ethereum - Bitcoin Sistemi


Although Ethereum is the world's largest altcoin, it has almost always been associated with high transaction fees.
Especially during busy periods during the week, incredible figures can be seen in Ethereum transaction fees. At the time of this writing, complex transactions such as swaps, borrowings and NFT sales on the ETH network cost between $20 and $30 on average.


Layer-2 altcoins, which aim to increase the scalability of the Ethereum network without losing its security features, continue to be popular due to the high fees of ETH.
However, there is an altcoin that, according to data, can perform the same transactions at almost 500 times cheaper than the transaction fees in ETH.





According to the data, transactions in Arbitrum can currently be concluded on average 505 times cheaper than Ethereum.

Here's how much less costly layer-2 altcoin networks are to trade than ETH, according to the latest data:



Arbitrum – 505 times
Starknet – 449 floors
Manta Pacific – 202 floors
zkSync – 155 times
Optimism – 135 times
Base – 92 floors

This Altcoin Network Spawned Half a Million Brand New Altcoins in May: Founder Explained - Bitcoin Sistemi


Nearly half a million tokens were launched on the Solana blockchain in May. The increase in token creation is attributed to lower barriers to entry and increased desire to create a popular memecoin.
In May alone, 455,000 tokens were created on Solana, dwarfing the numbers seen on other platforms. In comparison, 177,000 tokens were created on Ethereum layer 2 protocol Base, while 39,000 tokens were created on BNB Chain. The Ethereum mainnet and Layer 2 networks Arbitrum and Optimism each produced less than 20,000 tokens.



Austin Federa, director of strategy at the Solana Foundation, attributes this rise to Solana's unique features. “Solana is designed to be a high-throughput general-purpose layer 1 with fast completions and extremely low transaction fees,” Federa explained and added:

“As a result of these features, the increased mass token creation activities in Solana reduce the cost of experimentation and new idea generation to almost zero. Creating tokens in Solana should be as easy as creating content on the internet.”

Interestingly, the majority of Solana tokens are memecoins, which have recently attracted the attention of the cryptocurrency community. This trend comes after some Solana-based memecoins such as Dogwifhat, Bonk, and Book of Meme skyrocketed in the crypto market.

Shiba Inu Team Member Shares Important Security Update With Community | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu, due to its large community, has often been the target of scams due to the trust of the community in the project. As a result, the team has taken to routinely remind the community of multiple scams targeting them, and the latest has come from the admin, Da Vinci.
New Token Scams Targets Shiba Inu Community
Shiba Inu community member @Digarch shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) carrying a screenshot of a warning for the SHIBArmy regarding buying new tokens. The post which was made in the Discord group dives into the token scams and how they hope to exploit the community.

Da Vinci explained that these tokens were tricking investors by pretending to be connected with the Shiba Inu and Shibarium developers. Furthermore, they continue to exploit the Shiba State and Canine code to push their scams to unsuspecting victims. “They have even resorted to posting the shib.io address in their videos to lend false credibility to their schemes,” the post read.
The post further pointed out that the team cannot exclusively ban these tokens from its decentralized exchange (DEX) because of its decentralized. However, they have urged Shiba Inu investors to exercise caution, coupled with comprehensive research, when investing in any token to avoid being scammed.
Another major part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem being exploited is the TREAT tokens, which have not yet launched. However, it hasn’t stopped a number of fake TREAT tokens from popping up and trying to take advantage of the Shiba Inu community. “We will not hesitate to voice our strong disapproval of these scammers and their unethical practices,” Da Vinci said. “Stay informed and protect yourself.”
SHIB Investors Coming Back To The Table
Amid the warnings being sent to the community, Shiba Inu is seeing positive momentum in the market. This is especially visible in its daily trading volume, which is up 37% in the last day. This increase in the daily trading volume suggests a return of positive sentiment among investors.

Furthermore, SHIB continues to maintain its position as the 11th-largest cryptocurrency in the market, behind the likes of Toncoin and Cardano. However, despite its significant jump in daily trading volume, it has fallen behind newcomer, Notcoin, which currently boasts the 6th-largest daily trading volume at $4.25 billion.
At the time of writing, the SHIB price is trending at $0.00002491, indicating a 0.54% gain in the last day. According to CoinMarketCap data, the price is down 2.08% in the last week, but still painting 9.6% gains on the monthly chart.

Pantera Capital's $5 Million Investment Altcoin Decides to Change Its Name - Bitcoin Sistemi


Connext (NEXT), which describes itself as a Blockchain interoperability platform, will change its name to Everclear, according to its official statement.
The project stated that it will develop a kind of “exchange layer” in this context. According to the statement, this exchange layer is designed to address challenges related to rebalancing and reconciliation of intentions. Functioning as its own blockchain, this layer will serve as a backend liquidity platform that facilitates order matching for intent-based bridges.


To support the development and implementation of the clearing layer, Everclear sold $5 million of Connext (NEXT) tokens to cryptocurrency company Pantera Capital through an over-the-counter deal.

The development seems to have been welcomed by the token's community. The altcoin, which is traded on Bybit, one of the major stock exchanges, has gained approximately 8% in value in the last 24 hours.





According to its own statement, Connext hosts decentralized applications that work on all chains and can use all tokens, and claims to hold a total locked value of $ 1 billion.

Bitcoin's Make-or-Break Moment? | Bankless


Decision Time? Crypto assets steadily gained overnight after a stagnant weekend as market players around the globe returned to their desks. But shortly after the opening of U.S. markets, the move stalled out! Why has price run into resistance? Confirmation last month that pending spot Ethereum ETF applications would receive approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) turbocharged crypto prices, fueling a leg up that placed many tokens within striking range of achieving new cycle highs.The unexpected shift in approval odds caused underexposed traders to feverishly ape ETH, pushing the token just shy of new cycle highs above $4k; BTC was propelled within 2% of new all-time highs, briefly touching $72k.Source: TradingViewAlthough ETH achieved a higher local high last Monday, BTC was hammered lower prior to achieving one last week, a potentially worrisome sign for bulls that indicates sellers retain some amount of control. With BTC setting up to reject for the third time from range highs off a lower local high after an attempted breakout, crypto markets appear to be at a pivotal make-or-break moment…Continuation of the rally would swiftly send BTC to new all-time highs, undoubtedly yielding major tailwinds for the valuations of broader crypto assets, however, a breakdown from here would send the token tumbling back down towards the $60k range lows that have supported price throughout the last three months, subsequently putting further downside into play.Tangentially, spot volumes on BTC and ETH sharply fell last week, demonstrating a lack of interest at current prices that suggests a reversal in trend could be coming in the near future.Source: The BlockWhile crypto markets have been relatively devoid of significant volatility post spot ETH ETF approval confirmation, certain TradFi assets lit up their tapes with erratic swings in price this morning.Pseudonymous GameStock bull Roaring Kitty (aka Keith Gill) returned to the spotlight this weekend after a two week hiatus from social media, disclosing his ownership of 5M GME shares, unmasking himself as the whale that had accumulated a monster call position on the stock last week, and tweeting a green uno reverse card.GME more than doubled amid renewed memestock excitement, rallying as high as $45 during pre-market trading this morning, but has since given back much of the move, plunging to lows of $28 in cash trading.The New York Stock Exchange also experienced a major glitch this morning and was forced to halt trading on 50 listed assets, seemingly due to a software update which impacted price band guardrails designed to limit volatility.Most notable of the assets impacted were Class A shares of Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway, which tanked 99% on the open this morning prior to the trading halt.

The Rise in Bitcoin Mobilized the Whales: Three Giant Whales Purchased Large Amounts in Three Different Altcoins! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum start the new week with a good upward momentum, there is also activity on the whale front.
At this point, we first see that the smart Ethereum whale continues to collect ETH. According to Lookonchain's post, this whale, who made a profit of $76 million on Etrhereum, bought 7 thousand ETH worth $26.7 million from Binance today for $3,814.


Accordingly, the whale currently has 36,785 ETH (141 million ) with an estimated total profit of 76.6 million (+57.9%).
Apart from the Ethereum whale, another whale is also accumulating Fantom (FTM). Accordingly, the whale withdrew 2.96 million USDC from Aave and spent 2.23 million USDC, purchasing 2.82 million FTM at $0.79.






“A whale is buying FTM!
This whale withdrew 2.96 million USDC from Aave and spent 2.23 million USDC, buying 2.82 million FTM at $0.79. “He currently has 736K USDC left.”

Finally, a new wallet purchased 02.4 billion PEPE worth $23.07 million from Binance during the day.

After the USA and Hong Kong, Another Country Launches Bitcoin ETFs! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a milestone for the Australian financial market, Monochrome Asset Management's Monochrome Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) (IBTC) will begin trading on the Cboe Australia exchange on Tuesday.
Australia to Launch First Spot Bitcoin ETF with Direct BTC Assets
This development marks the introduction of Australia's first ETF directly holding Bitcoin, offering investors a simpler and regulated entry into the cryptocurrency market.


The product has received approval from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), ensuring it complies with the investor protection rules of the Australian Financial Services Licensing (AFSL) regime.
This regime imposes strict standards for directly held crypto assets, which do not apply to ETFs that hold Bitcoin indirectly or through offshore products.






The approval comes after the US gave the green light to spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, prompting regions such as Hong Kong and Australia to follow suit.
As of April, Hong Kong approved the first batch of crypto-related spot ETFs, underscoring a global trend towards adopting these financial instruments.


Jeff Yew, CEO of Monochrome Asset Management, emphasized the importance of this launch: “This aligns with Monochrome's investor protection-focused mission to provide safe, compliant and simple ways to participate in this transformative space.
“IBTC's direct holding structure is expected to provide Australian investors with enhanced protection and clarity in line with Monochrome's commitment to security and compliance.

Ethereum Sees Sentiment Reversal Among Institutional Investors Amid $2,000,000,000 Monthly Inflows: CoinShares - The Daily Hodl


								Digital assets manager CoinShares says institutions poured two billion dollars into crypto products last month.
In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, CoinShares says digital asset investment products reached $185 million in inflows last week.










“Digital asset investment products saw inflows for the 4th consecutive week totaling US $185 million, with May seeing US $2 billion inflows, pushing year-to-date inflows past the US $15 billion mark for the first time on record. Volumes were down for the week though, falling to US$8bn, relative to US $13 billion the week prior.”
The US region brought in $130 million in inflows while Switzerland and Canada saw inflows of $36 million and $25 million, a stark turnaround for Canada, which saw overall outflows last month.
With investor sentiment remaining bullish on Bitcoin (BTC), the crypto king raked in $148 million last week while short-BTC products saw outflows of $3.5 million.
Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) products brought in $33.5 million last week.
“This represents a turnaround in investor sentiment in an asset that had seen a 10-week run of outflows prior, totaling US $200 million. This positive news for Ethereum has also had an impact on Solana, which saw a further US $5.8 million inflow last week.”
Solana (SOL) enjoyed $5.8 million in inflows during the period, as Chainlink (LINK), XRP, Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) saw inflows of $1 million, $0.8 million, $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively.

Bitcoin Volume Crashes To Lows: Market Boredom Setting In?


								Data shows that Bitcoin trading volume has plummeted to extreme lows recently, a sign that investor interest in trading the asset is low.
Bitcoin Trading Volume Plunges As Price Continues To Move Sideways
According to data shared by CryptoQuant author IT Tech in an X post, the BTC trading volume has been quite low recently. The “trading volume” here refers to the total amount of Bitcoin that’s becoming involved in trades on all centralized exchanges on any given day.
When the value of this metric is high, it means that investors are currently making a large number of moves on these platforms. Such a trend implies that traders are interested in the coin.

On the other hand, the low metric can suggest that investors aren’t paying much attention to the cryptocurrency at the moment as they aren’t actively making trades.
Now, here is a chart that shows how the spot and derivatives trading volumes have looked for Bitcoin since the start of the year:

The value of the metric seems to have been quite low for both types of platforms | Source: @IT_Tech_PL on X
As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin trading volume has been primarily dominated by derivatives exchanges in the year so far, implying that futures and other products have seen the most interest.
Although the spot exchange trading volume has generally been much lower than the derivatives volume, it has still been sizeable at different points in the year.
Recently, however, the spot volume has become very low. It has also been similarly low before in the year, but what’s different this time is that the latest derivatives volume has also been pretty low. Thus, the volume as a whole has dried up in the Bitcoin market.
As for what could be driving this trend, the answer may lie in the recent price action. Usually, investors find phases where price moves fast to be exciting, so volume tends to rise in such periods as they jump to make trades and participate in speculation.
When an asset is stale, though, traders get bored and start paying attention to greener pastures instead. For a while now, Bitcoin has been stuck in consolidation, so it’s not surprising that investors have lost interest.

It remains to be seen how long these low volumes persist before a volatile move inevitably arrives to spark a renewal of interest in the cryptocurrency.
BTC Price
After witnessing a setback earlier, Bitcoin has surged back above the $70,000 level with a 3% rally during the last 24 hours. It’s unknown, though, whether this move will finally take BTC out of its recent tight range or if the asset will soon lose this recovery, continuing its sideways trend.

Looks like the price of the asset has registered an increase over the past day or so | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView

‘Bitcoin Fixes This’: Bitcoiners Take Aim at Berkshire Hathaway Amid Stock Glitch - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin fans had a laugh at Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett on Monday after the billionaire investor’s company seemingly crashed 99% in value.At 9:49 am ET, Berkshire’s class A shares (BRK.A) instantly tanked from $621,000 to just $185 apiece, prompting the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to halt trading for the asset temporarily.In reality, the massive drop was triggered by an unexplained technical issue at the NYSE, which impacted a slew of other large companies, including the Bank of Montreal (BMO). The issue was resolved within a few hours, trading resumed, and BRK.A actually closed the day 0.59% in the green.Still, the inordinately sized red candle wasn’t a good look for Buffett, especially as someone who has harshly criticized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as being too speculative and volatile.“Who’s the rat poison now eh,” tweeted Blockstream CEO Adam Back on Monday. “Rat poison squared” is what Buffett called Bitcoin back in May 2018, where he said he’d be glad to “buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies.” Since that time, BRK.A is up roughly 114%, while Bitcoin is up roughly 600%.Buffett’s late vice-chairman and partner Charlie Munger was also one of crypto’s most veracious critics, having called Bitcoin a “stupid” and “evil” investment that’s “very likely to got to zero.”Many joked about the momentary annihilation of Buffett’s net worth, and the investment opportunity it presented. “Finally, I have a chance to acquire Warren Buffett,” said billionaire investor and Tron founder Justin Sun.“If you bought $500 of Berkshire Hathaway 10 minutes ago it would now be worth over $2 million,” said crypto meme account “greg” after the stock recovered. “Let that sink in.”Others, like crypto exchange Kraken, noted how Bitcoin trading can never be halted like BRK.A was on the NYSE. “Bitcoin fixes this,” tweeted famous whistleblower Edward Snowden on the matter.While the Bitcoin network is 24/7 and never goes down, various centralized exchanges have halted Bitcoin trading and withdrawals on countless occasions—sometimes indefinitely. Many have had their share of explosive price glitches too, including a BTC flash crash below $9,000 on BitMEX just two months ago.Buffett never publicly addressed the sudden Berkshire crash, though meme accounts were sure to put some words in his mouth, reminiscent of previous crypto catastrophes.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Cryptocurrency Limitation from Binance! Which Users Will Be Affected? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it will limit unauthorized stablecoins for users in the European Union due to MiCA.
Accordingly, users will need to switch to and use stablecoins issued under MICA for access.



“This announcement only affects users in the European Economic Area (EEA).
On 30.06.2024, the new MiCA stablecoin rules will come into force in the European Economic Area (EEA).
This will be the first step in introducing the new regulatory framework and will have a significant impact on the stablecoin market in the EEA.
Since it is important for all users to understand the impact of the upcoming changes, here are some important details about the new rules and how Binance is implementing them.
At this point, Binance will restrict the availability of “Unauthorized Stablecoins” for EEA users in its product offerings starting from 30.06.2024 (UTC+3).
Because as of 30.06.2024 (UTC+3), stablecoins will be issued in the EEA; This means that in practice only certain regulated companies can issue and offer publicly traded stablecoins; these stablecoins shall be “Regulated Stablecoins.”

Consensus 2024: Crypto’s back, baby - Blockworks


Consensus 2024 wrapped last Friday, and it went out with a whisper. 
To be honest, that’s the case with most crypto conferences. By the end, people are ready to hop on their flights and jet home, especially if they decided to event-hop the night before (shout out to the two guys who agreed to a 4:30 am bedtime Thursday after leaving an event that wrapped up at 8:30 pm). 
This year’s conference, multiple people told me, was all about the side events. Again, that’s not unusual, but it did make the conference itself feel emptier at times. 
I attended Consensus last year, and thought that the comparison would be stark. But this year’s conference didn’t include as many flashy booths, though there were plenty of stages filled with interesting speakers. 
Dear reader, I have to admit I wasn’t there on the first day, but attendees told me that people were excited and crowds were large on Wednesday as the conference kicked off. That seemed to taper off slightly through Thursday and Friday, though.
I was told that there were close to 15,000 attendees, up from last year’s 10,000. The Austin Police Force’s presence seemed to verify my information, as security was definitely heightened throughout the conference. By Friday, it seemed like most had relaxed, and I even saw a police officer playing life-sized chess against an attendee. 
The vibe this year was very much focused on institutions, and clearly there’s support from both sides. For example, Google Cloud had a “start-up village” which included a stage for founders, investors and entrepreneurs, and which featured constantly a rotating assortment of panels and talks. 

Source: Consensus
Read more: RFK Jr is ‘happy’ about Trump’s crypto commitment
In that regard, it felt like crypto was back and definitely more upbeat than last year. While Consensus 2023 may have felt more crowded, there was a lot of healing still taking place as the industry dealt with the ramifications of the FTX collapse, bankruptcies and looming Securities and Exchange Commission actions (important to note, though, that neither Binance nor Coinbase had pending legal action at the time). 
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presence on Thursday definitely added to that, as the presidential candidate spoke both to the press and on stage. In fact, the news of former President Donald Trump’s verdict (found guilty on all 34 counts) broke while RFK Jr. was in the press conference. At first, he said he’d been “disciplined” about not commenting on the court cases. 
However, he and his team must’ve decided to change course, because he later said that he believes the verdict could end up “helping” Trump since it was the “weakest case” brought against him. 
One thing that was brought up in plenty of conversations both at the venue and the side events were the Jamie Dimon knock-offs stationed outside the entry doors. And, honestly, is it even a crypto conference if there aren’t some weird shenanigans taking place? (The answer is no.)
I still couldn’t tell you exactly what the point was, though — according to a press release in my inbox — the company behind the stunts is UNFK, “a secret society and Web3 game to prank the world’s largest corrupt corporations.”
While I heard reports about the lack of deodorant at ETH Denver, I can promise you that wasn’t the case at Consensus. I caught the strong whiff of cologne multiple times as I wandered the venue hall, even tearing up from the odor once or twice. 
There were also a large number of kids, at least on Friday, but perhaps that’s a sign of crypto maturing — though not in the way most of us expect I guess.
But, back to what’s important: Overall, it was a fun event and it felt like crypto really has bounced back. Vibes were high, side event food was good and there were productive conversations both on and off stage.

Roaring Kitty Faces ETrade Ban as GameStop Holdings Surge 48%: Report - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFamed investor and meme stock celebrity Keith Gill, better known as Roaring Kitty, may be dropped from top retail stock trading platform ETrade, according to a Wall Street Journal report.Citing “people familiar with the matter,” the WSJ said Monday that ETrade, owned by investment giant Morgan Stanley, is “growing concerned about potential stock manipulation around his recent purchases of GameStop (GME) stock.” The exclusive report comes as Gill's long-dormant account on Reddit posted a screenshot late Sunday of an investment account holding over $200 million worth of GameStop shares and call options.The return of Roaring Kitty to Twitter last month, and the DeepFuckingValue account on Reddit yesterday, has undoubtedly moved the market. After a Twitter post broke a two-week silence, the price of GME stock nearly doubled before the stock market opened the week. That price surge brought a big hit to GME short sellers, who stood to lose almost $1 billion betting against it.Even the unofficial GME tribute meme coin on Solana saw its price skyrocket over 150%.All of this echoes the meme stock mania that gripped both social media and traditional markets in 2021, where short-sellers of stocks like GME and AMC Entertainment (GME) were targeted by Roaring Kitty and other disillusioned investors, boosting their prices and causing significant losses for institutional fund managers.That frenzy caused many investment platforms—including the popular Robinhood app—to frequently halt trading of the suddenly volatile stocks, to great uproar—and eventually hearings on Capitol Hill.In fact, the WSJ reports, Morgan Stanley employees had been monitoring Gill's ETrade account since Roaring Kitty resurfaced on Twitter in mid-May, after more than two years away.The employees “saw he had purchased call options before the tweet,” and that “Gill’s trades likely generated profits thanks to the stock move his tweet generated,” the Journal reported.With GME seeing a new flurry of activity, ETrade appears to be considering pulling the plug on Gill. Based on the Reddit posts, he stands to make a tidy sum if his latest bet—that GME stock will be worth more than $20 on June 21—turns out to be true. Those who follow his lead would gain as well.Today alone, the Roaring Kitty account is up 48%, or about $85 million, according to investment tracker @unusual_whales on Twitter.Parent company Morgan Stanley engaged its financial crimes unit and external counsel on the matter. But the company knows that taking action would mean “drawing the attention of his meme army.““Morgan Stanley employees have been concerned that closing Gill’s account could result in the firm losing ETrade clients,” the Wall Street Journal noted.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Binance Announces Major Changes To Stablecoin Access In Europe From June 30 | Bitcoinist.com


								Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has recently announced significant changes to its stablecoin regulations in Europe. 
Starting from the end of June, Binance will begin restricting access to “unauthorized” stablecoins in compliance with the new MiCA stablecoin rules across the European Economic Area (EEA). 
Binance Adapts To New Stablecoin Regulations
Under the new regulations, only regulated companies will be permitted to issue and offer stablecoins to the public, which will be classified as “Regulated Stablecoins.” 
As a result, several existing stablecoins may not meet the requirements to be categorized as such. They will consequently be subject to certain restrictions, earning them the “Unauthorized Stablecoins.”

To ensure a clear transition for its users and comply with the MiCA stablecoin rules, Binance will implement phased changes to the availability of Unauthorized Stablecoins, as announced on Monday. These changes will affect various aspects of Binance’s product offerings.
Starting from June 30, the exchange will restrict the availability of the labeled Unauthorized Stablecoins for EEA users across its entire range of products and services. This includes Binance Convert, Spot Trading, Wallet, and more. 
Users cannot engage in new products or services involving Unauthorized Stablecoins. Binance aims to prevent market disruptions and ensure compliance with the MiCA stablecoin rules.
Impacts will also be felt in various areas of Binance’s ecosystem. Rewards, such as those obtained from the Rewards Center, Campaigns, and Referrals, will be altered to be distributed in Regulated Stablecoins, BNB, or other non-stablecoin tokens. 
More Changes Ahead
Spot Copy Trading will cease to be available for EEA users on June 29. Individuals using this service are advised to close their positions and transfer their funds to their respective Spot Wallets before the specified date and time. 
Margin trading will also be affected, as new borrowings and transfers of Unauthorized Stablecoins as collateral into users’ Margin Wallets will be blocked. Existing Margin loans, however, will remain unaffected and will not be subject to forced liquidation until further notice. 
Margin traders impacted by these changes are encouraged to close margin loans involving Unauthorized Stablecoins. Existing holdings of Unauthorized Stablecoins in Margin Wallets may still be utilized for trading until further notice.

Binance’s Launchpad, Launchpool, Simple Earn, Loans & VIP Loans, Auto-Invest, Dual Investment, Cloud Mining, Binance Pay, Send Cash, Red Packet, NFT purchases, Spend To Earn, Gift Cards, Web3 Wallet – Earn Section, P2P, and OTC trades will also experience specific restrictions or changes related to Unauthorized Stablecoins.

Bitcoin Has Solid On-Chain Cushion Below $68,900: Stage Set For Fresh Rally?


																On-chain data shows Bitcoin could have significant support between $66,900 and $68,900, which may help provide solid ground for a fresh surge to higher levels.
A Large Amount Of Investors Bought Their Bitcoin Between $66,900 & $68,900
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, BTC is currently floating above a major demand zone. In on-chain analysis, the strength of any support or resistance level is based on how much “demand” was present at it.

Here, the size of the dot correlates to the total number of tokens that were last acquired at the corresponding price range. It would appear that, out of these zones, the levels between $66,900 and $68,900 currently host the cost basis of the greatest amount of BTC.
More than two million addresses have acquired 1.1 million BTC inside this range. Since the current BTC spot price is above these levels, all investors who buy there will make slight profits.
Investor cost basis is important in the on-chain analysis because the level has special psychological significance. A potential retest of it can result in a flip of the profit-loss balance for the holder.
As such, investors may be prone to making some moves when a retest like this takes place. A holder carrying losses before the retest (that is, the retest is happening from below) may be tempted to sell for fear that the price will go down in the future.
On the other hand, an investor in the green before the retest may have reason to believe the price would go up again and, thus, could decide to accumulate more.
When retests of price ranges thick with investors, one of these reactions may arise on a scale that could be relevant for the wider market, therefore, major demand zones below can act as support points, while those above can act as resistance blocks.

Bitcoin has a large support range of $66,900 to $68,900 right now, which could help cushion any falls should the asset’s price decrease.
From the chart, it’s also apparent that, at the same time, the Bitcoin ranges ahead are thin with holders. This could, in theory, provide the ideal conditions for a rally towards higher levels.

Global AI Adoption Hits 72%, Generative AI Use Doubles in 2024: Report - Decrypt

More than seven out of 10 of businesses and organizations around the world are using artificial intelligence, a new study by the global management consulting firm McKinsey has found, a significant increase from the approximately 50% adoption rate observed a year ago.In a survey of more than 1,363 respondents, 72% said their organizations had adopted some form of AI in at least one business function, and 65% said their organizations were regularly using generative AI—twice the 33% rate reported in 2023.The impact of AI and generative AI extends across borders and industries. Last year, AI adoption was no higher than 66% in any part of the world, but this year, more than two-thirds of respondents in nearly every region report their organizations are using AI—with the largest increases in the Asia-Pacific region and China.The study garnered responses from 1,363 participants through an online survey in early 2024, with the results released last week. McKinsey says the data set could represent a full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. To adjust for differences in response rates, McKinsey weighted the data by the contribution of each respondent's nation to global gross domestic product (GDP).Last year, McKinsey published a report stating that "Generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually" to the world economy. This is equivalent to 15 to 40 percent of the entire economic impact of artificial intelligence as a whole.While AI, or artificial intelligence, is a broad term that encompasses various technologies designed to emulate human intelligence, generative AI is a specific subset of AI that focuses on creating new content. Traditional AI systems often analyze and interpret data, make decisions, and solve problems based on pre-existing information. But Generative AI uses deep learning techniques to generate new data that resembles the training dataset. This can include creating text, images, music, and even limited 3D worlds.Broken down by industry, the biggest increase in AI use was found in professional services, including human resources, legal services, and management consulting, where organizations are leveraging its power for areas that require human interaction for repetitive tasks.“The average organization using gen AI is doing so in two functions, most often in marketing and sales and in product and service development,” the study says. In sales alone, the use of generative AI has more than doubled since last year.The use of AI has matured, McKinsey reports, with organizations now more involved in mitigating its risks—particularly in terms of hallucinations and intellectual property infringement. The top concern among respondents was tackling inaccuracy, rising from 56% to 63%. Workforce and labor displacement fell as a concern, from 34% to 27%.Of the risk categories surveyed, respondents were least worried about environmental impact, political stability, and physical safety.Perhaps not surprisingly, McKinsey said AI adoption is boosting company bottom lines.“Respondents most commonly report meaningful revenue increases of more than 5% in supply chain and inventory management,” the study says.The study also found that many organizations are not just using off-the-shelf AI solutions but are customizing them or developing their own proprietary models. This trend towards tailoring AI technologies to meet specific business needs and achieve competitive advantage is particularly prevalent in industries with high public engagement, McKinsey notes.“Respondents in energy and materials, technology, and media and telecommunications are more likely to report significant customization or tuning of publicly available models or developing their own proprietary models to address specific business needs,” the report said.The study also found a significant increase in the use of generative AI both at work and in personal lives compared to last year. With the explosion of popularity of tools like ChatGPT, MidJourney and Stable Diffusion, people are using generative AI for more than business, exploring entertainment, education, and even simulating social interactions.For McKinsey, AI is more than just hype or a business trend. Generative AI is proving to be a business-changing technology.“If 2023 was the year the world discovered generative AI, 2024 is the year organizations truly began using—and deriving business value from—this new technology,” the report concludes.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Early Ethereum ($ETH) Investors Cash Out After 1,200,000% Gain Since ICO | Cryptoglobe


                                
Two early Ethereum investors have recently moved the funds that they acquired at the time of the network’s initial coin offering (ICO), to seemingly cash out their funds after they appreciated around 1,200,000% from their purchase price.



According to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, two separate Ethereum ICO participants have recently deposited a total of 9,518 ETH worth around $36.3 million at the time of the deposit onto popular centralized cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.



The deposit came after they invested in the now second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at the time of its Genesis, with its price then being of around $0.31 per ETH, meaning that the value of their funds appreciate 1,200,000% since then, with one ETH now trading at $3,780.







The ICO participants, however, deposited only a portion of the 200,000 ETH their received at the time they purchased it during the ICO, having spent $62,000 on the cryptocurrency, with their holdings now worth well over $750 million.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The transactions came after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved form 19b-4 filings for several spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a move that sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market and paving the way for these products to start trading.



Michael Nadeau, a prominent crypto analyst, recently provided an in-depth analysis of the current and future state of the cryptocurrency market, with a particular focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggesting ETH could significantly outperform BTC in the near future.



On top of that, data shows that since Ethereum transitioned into a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm and after the London hard fork, over $16.6 billion worth of the cryptocurrency have been burned.



The London hard fork included the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, which changed the way transaction fees on the network work.

Bitcoin (BTC) to Test $70,000 Again This Week? XRP Fights for Bull Market Comeback, Did Ethereum (ETH) Hit Plateau?

Bitcoin did not give up on the $68,000-$70,000 price range and might be gaining some momentum for a breakthrough attempt. The digital gold is currently trading at around $69,000, bouncing off of the 26 EMA. However, $69,400 is a significant resistance threshold that may cause some serious trouble if BTC does not gain enough momentum.As Bitcoin attempts to break through the critical $70,000 barrier once more, the BTC/USD chart shows a bullish sentiment. The price has demonstrated resilience and the possibility of upward movement by recently rebounding off the 26-day Exponential Moving Average. BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewThis rebound implies that buyers are intervening and giving the market the support it needs to remain above $68,000. Currently Bitcoin is battling the $69,400 resistance level, a critical point that has historically been challenging to surpass. If this level is not broken, there could be a reversal toward $70,000 and lower.A correction may find additional support at the 50-day EMA and the 100-day EMA, which are both positioned below the current price. The trading volume has increased somewhat, suggesting that traders are becoming more interested and involved. Any meaningful price movement must be sustained by this volume spike.XRP's questionable stateXRP is currently in a mixed state: on the one hand, the asset is still heavily suppressed; on the other, it is gaining some power and potentially even gaining some strength for a bounce. One way or another, it is still moving under the 50 EMA and definitely has to break through in order to be considered a bounce contender.Given that XRP has not yet been able to decisively break through the 50-day EMA it is especially important. If the price continues to rise above this barrier, it may be a sign that buyers are taking charge and driving up the price. But the bearish attitude might still be prevalent as long as XRP stays below this mark.The low trading volume may indicate a lack of confidence among traders. XRP will require more trading volume to sustain the price movement in order to create a successful recovery. Strong participation is usually indicated by high volume, which can also confirm the direction of the price trend. The RSI is in a neutral zone, at around 50 and does not provide any substantial insight.Ethereum's issueEthereum is clearly facing some struggles as the asset has stayed in the same trading range for the last few weeks. Considering the trading volume, it is not the issue, since bears are not really ready to push it downwards. But there is also an important factor to consider: the exhaustion of bulls.The Ethereum/USD chart indicates that the cryptocurrency has been settling into a small range, approximately ranging from $3,750 to $3,850. The price has not broken out considerably higher despite prior bullish momentum suggesting a possible plateau. Although sellers are not actively bringing prices down this stagnation may be the result of bullish exhaustion, in which buyers lack the power to drive prices higher. More context is given by the chart's moving averages. But failing to break above the present resistance level around $3,850 might indicate a consolidation phase or even a possible retreat. The current range needs to be broken, and volume analysis indicates that trading activity has not increased significantly. Increased market participation would be indicated by a spike in volume, which might encourage a breakout. The low but consistent volume for the time being indicates that traders are waiting to see what will happen before making a big move. Ethereum is getting close to overbought conditions, as indicated by the RSI, which is currently trading between 60 and 70. Even if it is not a drastic scenario, it implies that the upside potential might be constrained in the absence of a market correction or consolidation period.

Profits of Bitcoin short-term holders dip 32%, but here's the good news - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s short-term holder metric showed the recent consolidation has eroded their profits.
An influx of new investors could arrive, which might lead to a price breakout.

Bitcoin [BTC] short-term holder (STH) profits were down 32%, crypto analyst Axel Adler observed. On the 13th of March, the profit of STHs was 42%.
At press time, even though the price of Bitcoin is not much lower, the profit is at 10%.

This is a positive development. The consolidation of the past two months has done its job and shaken out the impatient market participants. The high-profit levels have also been reset, giving Bitcoin bulls renewed energy to drive prices higher.
AMBCrypto took a closer look at on-chain metrics to understand the behavior of short-term and long-term holders, and what insights that could have for the future price trends.
Using the realized price age bands to understand holders’ sentiment

The UTXO realized price age distribution metric showed that holders whose Bitcoin is aged 1 month to 18 months saw increased activity since March. The degree of this increase varied, with the shorter-term holders being more active in the markets.
On the other hand, the 18-month to 3-year-old Bitcoin saw a decline in activity. This was a sign of reduced coin movement from these holders, which further outlined strong bullish expectations from the long-term investors.
New investors could be poised to enter the market soon
Historically, the first two months after the halving have seen BTC consolidate. The reduced activity among the older cohorts reflects this expectation as they did not see a dramatic shift in activity in the past two months.

Another post from Axel Adler highlighted this. The realized market capitalization from investors holding BTC for less than a month had fallen dramatically in recent weeks but was beginning to climb higher again.

If this uptrend continues, it could mark a new phase of price expansion for Bitcoin. Investors and traders could keep a close eye on this metric.
With STH profits down, we will likely see a move northward, but the demand was not yet in place to drive this price move.

Ripple CEO Delivers Harsh Criticism For Dogecoin, What's The Problem? | Bitcoinist.com


								The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, has taken an unexpected swipe at Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme coin by market capitalization. Garlinghouse has criticized Dogecoin, claiming it lacks real utility due to its meme-based nature. 
“Dogecoin Has Not Been Good For The Industry”
At the Consensus 2024 Conference, one of the world’s largest and longest-running crypto-focused gatherings, Garlinghouse publicly criticized Dogecoin (DOGE), disparaging its intrinsic value and real-world use cases. 

The Ripple CEO shed light on the prevailing speculation narrative surrounding the cryptocurrency sector, implying that the crypto industry has not yet achieved widespread acceptance and regulatory clarity, given its status as a nascent and speculative global industry. 
Additionally, Garlinghouse disclosed that the crypto sector must transcend its speculative narrative, suggesting that meme-based cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, which thrives on speculation, presented a significant hurdle to the industry’s evolutionary progress. 
The Ripple CEO also stated during the conference that Dogecoin has not been a good development for the crypto industry. He acknowledged that he was not opposed to Dogecoin, but emphasized his uncertainty about the meme coin’s real-world applications. Moreover, he pointed out that Dogecoin lacked projects aimed at providing practical solutions to utility needs. 
As a meme coin, Dogecoin’s value is primarily influenced by its community, popularity and social media trends. Although the meme coin was created as a joke in late 2013 by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, over the years, Dogecoin has grown astronomically. 
The cryptocurrency has consistently pushed beyond the bounds of the meme coin status, cultivating a community with millions of investors and supporters and rising to an all-time high of $0.73. Additionally, Dogecoin has gained recognition from prominent celebrities including SpaceX and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk. 
While the doggy-themed meme coin may not have tangible use cases, Dogecoin remains a valuable investment in the crypto industry. Additionally, it acts as a cross-border payment solution for many crypto users, offering users reduced fees and faster transactions, in contrast to Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency. 
Problem Solving Takes Centre Stage In Crypto Industry
While speaking at the Consensus 2024 conference, Garlinghouse disclosed that the advancement of the crypto industry depends on solving real problems. He stressed that beyond Dogecoin, he had observed substantial utility emerging from various crypto projects across different chains, indicating that these practical solutions are what will ultimately improve the industry in the long run. 

An example of a crypto project focused on solving problems in the industry could be said to be Ripple. Operating as a cryptocurrency payments system, Ripple strives to become a payment settlement asset exchange and remittance system, offering a more efficient alternative to SWIFT, the vast messaging network utilized by banks and other financial institutions. 
Ripple’s use cases are extensive but primarily center on utilizing blockchain technology and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) native token, XRP to facilitate transactions between financial institutions, businesses and organizations.

Trader Says Ethereum-Based Altcoin ‘About To Get Sent,’ Predicts Massive Q4 Rallies for Bitcoin, ETH and Solana - The Daily Hodl


								Widely followed trader Inmortal says this year will see massive rallies for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and one additional altcoin.
The pseudonymous trader tells his 214,000 followers on the social media platform X that API3 (API3), a decentralized data oracle network that aims to connect traditional APIs with blockchain applications, is ready to “get sent” after a long consolidation period.










Inmortal mentions API3’s recent strategic funding round led by digital asset investment firm DWF labs and the bullish technicals on the altcoin’s chart.
“API3 about to get sent.
API3 has successfully concluded a strategic funding round, allocating treasury assets in exchange for four million USDC.
About the chart? nothing more to add, it’s just hyper bullish.
> +600 days accumulation over
> Clean retest of acc zone.
Send it.”
Source: Inmortal/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that the Ethereum-based altcoins will hit $6. At time of writing, API3 is trading at $3.37, up over 9% in the past day.
Looking at the broader markets, Inmortal is predicting strong 2024 finishes for BTC, ETH and SOL. According to the analyst, the next couple of months will likely be uneventful for much of the digital asset markets but expects a full-blown “parabolic uptrend” in Q4.
“> Boring June-July (chop + some traps for both sides)
> Uptrend resume in August
> Parabolic trend all Q4
BTC goes above $100,000, ETH above $10,000, $SOL above $500.
Altcoins do a x2-x5
Charts never lie.”

Dapper Labs Reaches $4 Million Settlement in NBA Top Shot NFT Lawsuit - Decrypt

Dapper Labs, the company behind NBA Top Shot and other prominent on-chain collectibles, has settled a yearslong class action lawsuit with disgruntled customers who argued that Top Shot NFTs constituted illegally offered securities, court filings revealed Monday.As part of the settlement, Dapper will pay out $4 million to the suit’s plaintiffs, the company’s CEO, Roham Gharegozlou, told Decrypt. Those funds include monetary relief for the plaintiffs’ claims, and will also cover legal fees.In return, if the settlement is approved, the plaintiffs will forfeit any future right to claim that Top Shot NFTs are securities, per Gharegozlou. “The settlement provides legal clarity and frees the Dapper Labs team up to focus on its core mission—delivering unparalleled experiences for its core users,” the executive said.Last February, a federal judge ruled—in a major setback for Dapper—that the lawsuit could proceed, given that Top Shot NFTs “plausibly” met the definition of a securities offering. Key to the judge’s finding was the fact that Top Shot NFTs live on Flow, a blockchain network originally developed by Dapper. The judge deemed Flow a “private” blockchain, in contrast with networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are not controlled by any one entity. Further, the judge found that statements made by Dapper and its representatives, including Gharegozlou, had implied the collectibles would increase in value over time. The company has insisted in the past—and Gharegozlou maintained today—that Flow is sufficiently decentralized and not under Dapper’s control, given that the network is maintained by the independent Flow Foundation.The Dapper co-founder added, however, that the class action suit’s plaintiffs demanded “certain business changes” at the company as a condition of the settlement. Those demands, which have been accepted by Dapper, include the company’s relinquishing of any FLOW tokens in its possession allocated for Ecosystem Reserve to the Flow Foundation.Other demands, such as that third party marketplaces besides Dapper be permitted to transact Top Shot NFTs, and that the company process withdrawals in a more timely manner, were already remedied years ago.When the suit was first filed in 2021—the heyday of the digital asset boom—it marked one of the first tests of the security status of NFTs. Since then, huge swathes of the crypto fungible token market have come under fire by American regulators. Except for sporadic circumstances featuring particular facts, NFTs appear to have—at least, for now—avoided such asset class-wide repudiation.Edited by Andrew Hayward.

Unlike Polymarket, which blocks U.S. users under a regulatory settlement but has traders around the world, PredictIt is open only to Americans.

'Bank to the Stars' Facing $770,000,000 Lawsuit for Allegedly Aiding Ponzi Scheme, Ignoring Glaring Red Flags: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A lender known as the “bank to the stars” is being sued for $770 million for allegedly aiding and abetting a Hollywood Ponzi scheme.
Plaintiffs for the lawsuit accuse the Los Angeles-based lender City National Bank (CNB) of enabling a fraudulent scheme that bilked hundreds of investors, reports the Los Angeles Times.










The lawsuit alleges CNB provided millions of dollars in loans to Zachary Horwitz, the mastermind of a film-licensing scheme that fleeced more than $690 million from friends, family and other investors.
In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced Horwitz had been convicted of violating multiple securities laws for duping victims with claims that investors would see more than 35% returns from his business of selling movie rights to Netflix and HBO. But in reality, Horwitz never sold any movie rights to the streaming services and used the money to fund his luxurious lifestyle and satisfy earlier investors.
The lawsuit claims that between 2013 and 2019, the lender processed $1 billion in transactions for Hortwitz, issued $64.2 million in loans and gave him 456 credit extensions.
The bank also allegedly ignored “glaring red flags” and “bent the rules” for Horwitz throughout the years while substantially assisting him by “adding an air of legitimacy” to his Ponzi scheme. According to the lawsuit, City National Bank knew that Horwitz bragged about his relationship with the lender in the documents he shared with investors.
The plaintiffs are asking the court to order CNB to pay $770 million to victims of Horwitz’s scheme.
A spokesperson at the lender says the bank won’t comment on ongoing litigation.
City National Bank has more than $93.72 billion in assets with 70 locations across eight states.

Iggy Azalea Goes Full Solana With Mad Lads PFP as MOTHER Nears $90 Million Market Cap - Decrypt

Rapper Iggy Azalea’s MOTHER token on Solana saw a spark of trading demand over the weekend, surging to an all-time high price on Saturday—just days after it launched. And the musician, who has been broadly embraced by Crypto Twitter, continued her constant tweeting with a familiar-looking profile picture (PFP) in tow.Azalea started rocking a custom Mad Lads PFP on Friday, one day after the Solana project tweeted out a custom honorary avatar for her that was apparently based on a photo reference. Mad Lads is the most valuable Solana NFT collection by a wide margin, currently standing at over $10,300 worth of SOL on secondary marketplaces.One day after equipping the PFP, Azalea’s MOTHER token jumped to a new peak price of $0.08952, per data from CoinMarketCap, giving it a market cap of $88.7 million.The price fell by nearly half by Sunday night, but then rebounded again on Monday, nearly matching the previous peak before starting to dip again. As of this writing, MOTHER sits at a price above $0.72, giving it a market cap over $70 million. It’s up 34% on the day.The rapper’s crypto market entrance last week was marked by drama. She launched the token after controversial crypto promoter Sahil Arora—who had helped deploy Caitlin Jenner’s meme coin earlier in the week—teased an IGGY token and collected $380,000 worth of presale funds for a token that ultimately had nothing to do with her.Azalea said that ultimately she decided not to work with Arora, and tweeted at him publicly to “take your L and go already.” Azalea was widely praised by traders on Twitter for being so heavily engaged and admitting that she was learning as she went, promising that the meme coin wouldn’t be a simple cash grab or pump-and-dump.Nearly a week later, she’s still in the arena (of Crypto Twitter), spreading memes and rocking a custom PFP as her token again flirts with higher gains.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Dapper Labs Agrees to $4M Settlement in Class Action Securities Suit

“We are continuing to push for more overarching regulatory clarity to showcase that consumer NFTs are not financial products and, as such, should be regulated under well-established consumer protection regimes at the state level,” Gharegozlou said. “This includes pushing for legislation at the federal level that makes it clear that consumer product NFTs, such as NBA Top Shot, are not subject to federal financial regulation.”

XRP's $299M question: Are whales betting big on a rally? - AMBCrypto



XRP remains sluggish with a mixed derivatives market, waning trader interest, and declining social volume.
Whales remain very interested in XRP as they acquire $299million worth of tokens in 24 hours.

Ripple [XRP] has continued with its sluggish performance, making no moves over the past week. 
The crypto community and whales, in general, have always valued XRP, but as time goes on, it becomes increasingly difficult to see it being one of the top performers of this bull cycle.
XRP shows mixed signals
The XRP derivatives market is presenting a mixed but interesting picture. Despite the token’s somewhat stagnant price movement, the trading volume has surged dramatically, showing a spike in trader activity and interest. 
Source: Coinglass
However, this hasn’t translated into a similar rise in open interest. So, while transactions are frequent, they may not be resulting in new or sustained positions, possibly due to traders being quick to take profits or cut losses amid uncertainty.
Source: Coinglass
Moreover, data from Whale Alert revealed that whales are, as usual, stacking up on XRP. In just twenty-four hours, they acquired nearly $300m in XRP. 
XRP’s general trend shows a decline in social engagement, which might mirror the current lackluster performance.
 The crypto community’s waning interest, as reflected in declining social volumes, could be a response to its ongoing performance issues, indicating a cooling off in investor sentiment towards the Ripple token.
Source: Santiment
The XRP chart, however, shows us a clear bearish sentiment among traders. The price has recently been oscillating just below the significant moving average lines, which are converging around $0.5162, suggesting a potential area of resistance.
Source: TradingView
The RSI, currently hovering around 53.34, supports this bearish outlook, indicating a state of equilibrium where buying and selling pressures are somewhat balanced. 
Given the subdued trading volume, the token appears to be consolidating within a narrow range, awaiting either a catalyst to spark a breakout or a further breakdown.

Read Ripple’s [XRP] Price Prediction 2024-2025

For short-term traders, the key levels to watch would be the resistance at the moving averages and support around $0.5162. 
A decisive break below this support could confirm a bearish trajectory for XRP, whereas a push above the moving averages will signal a move toward a more bullish market sentiment.

Major Milestone: Hong Kong Regulator Approves 11 Crypto Exchanges To Operate In The City | Bitcoinist.com


								The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has recently granted initial approval to 11 cryptocurrency exchanges to continue operating in the city. 
This marks the first step towards issuing virtual asset trading platform (VATP) licenses since 2022. The move comes as Hong Kong aims to establish itself as a prominent crypto hub alongside global counterparts like Singapore and Dubai.
Hong Kong’s Crypto Exchange Scene Faces Regulatory Hurdles
According to a South China Morning Post report, among the approved exchanges, Crypto.com, originally founded in Hong Kong and now operating from Singapore, stands out as the largest exchange “deemed to be licensed.” 
Notably, it is the only exchange within the top 20 by 24-hour trading volume measured by CoinGecko, still seeking a license in Hong Kong. Bullish, incorporated in Gibraltar but also operating from Singapore and New York, is the next significant exchange deemed licensed.

Under the new regulations introduced last year, cryptocurrency exchanges must obtain approval for the deeming arrangement to continue operating while awaiting full licensing approval. 
The deadline for exchanges not seeking a license to cease operations was June 1. However, some exchanges have withdrawn their license applications due to complications arising from the regulatory changes.
Several exchanges that withdrew their applications had ties to mainland China, where they were originally founded but left following Beijing’s crackdown on digital tokens. Notable exchanges include local affiliates of major platforms such as OKX, Binance, HTX, KuCoin, Gate.io, and, most recently, Bybit. 
The Hong Kong government has emphasized compliance with regulations, including measures to prevent mainland Chinese residents from accessing crypto platforms and the recently approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) markets. 
Market Confidence Shaken? 
Per the report, the withdrawals have raised concerns about Hong Kong’s progress in attracting crypto-related businesses and developing a thriving Web3 ecosystem. The city began its efforts to become a crypto hub in late 2022. 
Legislative Council member Duncan Chiu, representing the information technology sector, expressed in an opinion piece that the withdrawals had shaken market confidence in local Web3 development. Despite hopes of accessing mainland Chinese customers, Beijing maintains a strict ban on commercial crypto activities on the mainland. 
The financial authority of Shenzhen, the city neighboring Hong Kong, recently issued a warning against cross-border cryptocurrency trading, emphasizing that such activities are “illegal and subject to criminal liabilities.” 
The notice also highlighted the dangers of crypto-related fraud and reiterated the illegality of providing internet services to mainland customers without approval.

Overall, Hong Kong’s granting of initial approval to exchanges represents a significant step in the city’s regulatory journey toward becoming an innovation hub. However, challenges remain, including withdrawing exchanges with mainland Chinese ties and Beijing’s strict commercial digital asset activity ban. 
The future of Hong Kong’s virtual asset market will depend on striking a balance between regulatory compliance, market confidence, and attracting businesses within the evolving global crypto landscape.

XRP Hasn’t Had A Bull Cycle Since 2017, Analyst Reveals What Will Happen When It Does


																The XRP price has been a constant point of worry for investors given that the altcoins seems to be frozen in time. The last time that the coin rallied was in the 2017-2018 bull and even though there has been another massive bull market since then, XRP failed to follow the rest of the market. While expectations for the altcoin have dropped dramatically, one analyst believes that the cryptocurrency could finally have its time in the spotlight, revealing targets for when this does happen.
Why XRP Could Be Gearing Up For A Bull Rally
Crypto analyst CryptoManiac101 took to the TradingView platform to share a rather interesting view of the XRP price going forward. The analyst pointed out a number of indicators that suggest that the altcoin may finally be getting ready to move. One of the major points in the analysis was the price levels and movements so far.

	Related Reading


The crypto analyst points out a convergence of three different moving averages in the year 2024. At the end of this is the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern outlined in the chart. Furthermore, the convergence, which is happening around $0.51, suggests that there is consolidation going on. Now, usually, consolidation will come with accumulation, which is often good for the price, and the analyst points out that interest is rising.
Going further, the crypto analyst points to the performance of XRP over the last 11 years. This begins from 2013 and moves to present time, showing how the performance of XRP has actually flattened during this time. “Significant historical price spikes, particularly in 2017 and 2018, are visible, which is what we are looking at for 2024 and 2025 years as we see some movement consistency between the two cycles,” the analyst stated.
Source: Tradingview.com
With interesting rising, these indicators could point toward an important breakout for the price. If this happens, the crypto analyst has outlined targets for how high the price could go.
How High Can The Price Go?
One major factor in the analyst’s prediction is the fact that such historical patterns have been previously bullish for XRP to have returned. The analyst points out that a rally usually breaks out when these patterns have seen a 75% completion. However, the current patterns have reached 88.93% completion, suggesting that a breakout is long overdue for the XRP price.

	Related Reading


In the event of a rally, the crypto analyst expects an at least 800% increase in price above $4. This future prediction is based on the potential of a breakout from the symmetrical triangle forming at the convergence of the three moving averages. In this case, the analyst expects a rally to $4.5 as a starting point.

Bitcoin's Next Leap:: Billionaire Points To $500,000 Per BTC-Here's When & How


								Chamath Palihapitiya, a well-known billionaire investor, has joined the dialogue about future Bitcoin Halving events and their implications for the asset in the long term.
According to the Billionaire, this notable event that occurs in the Bitcoin ecosystem every four years could propel Bitcoin’s value to as high as $500,000 in the upcoming years, and here’s how.

Post-Halving Price Movements: A Historical Insight
The premier cryptocurrency has historically shown significant price movements post-halving, with most substantial gains typically occurring 12 to 18 months after the event.
Palihapitiya points out that while the price tends to show modest increases initially, substantial surges have followed previous Halvings. For instance, the first Halving led to a more than tenfold increase six months later and 45.52x after 18 months.

Subsequent cycles also saw significant but slightly more moderate gains. For context, after 18 months of the second Halving, the Bitcoin price saw a 27.92x increase, and the third Halving rose nearly 8x.
Bitcoin has been consolidating in the current cycle, which Palihapitiya interprets as part of its usual growth trajectory. He suggests that if Bitcoin follows the patterns observed in the second and third cycles, there could be an exponential rise, potentially reaching as high as $500,000 by October 2025.

Bitcoin’s Path to $500K And The Dual Currency Future
Elaborating on the potential of BTC hitting $500,000, Palihapitiya added that this cycle is distinct due to the “commercialization” of BTC, highlighted by the introduction of spot ETF products in the US, which could influence the cryptocurrency’s valuation significantly.

Palihapitiya states that these financial products allow “Bitcoin to cross the chasm” and have its “central key moment.” He further explains the evolving global financial landscape, predicting a future in which many countries will adopt a “dual currency” system.
According to the Billionaire, countries will increasingly recognize the need for their local currency for everyday transactions and BTC for acquiring substantial assets with enduring digital value.

Palihapitiya concluded, emphasizing the “transformative” potential of BTC:
 I think that is a very powerful concept. If these things start to get to these levels of appreciation, it [BTC] is going to completely replace gold and start to become something that has transactional utility for hard assets. And I think if you marry that with the worry that some folks have for the dollar debasement, you start to see some really interesting opportunities.

$68K or $74K: How Bitcoin's next move depends on this key level - AMBCrypto



The 1-hour chart showed that BTC formed an asymmetric triangle, suggesting a breakout
If the price closes above the resistance, it could hit an all-time high soon.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] price seemed to have displayed two opposing signals. If one goes through, it could make way for a higher value. However, if the other comes first, holders of the coin would have to deal with a price decrease.
Analyst Ali Martinez made this known in two different posts on X. In his first post,  Martinez mentioned that Bitcoin had formed an asymmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart, indicating that the price could jump to $74,400.
It’s a breakout or breakdown
But there was one condition attached to it. The prediction might only come to pass if Bitcoin closes above the $69,330 resistance.
An asymmetrical triangle occurs when two trendlines with opposing slopes converge. A close above the upper resistance in this instance brings about breakout.
Source: X
On the other hand, if the price dumps into the support, a notable correction could be next. At press time, Bitcoin changed hands at $69,031, meaning it was close to the resistance point.
However, the analyst’s second post focused on the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential. According to him, this indicator had flashed a sell signal which could send BTC down to $68,050.
Again, he mentioned that the next direction for the coin depends on the resistance as mentioned earlier. Beyond this technical data, it is also important to look at Bitcoin’s price action from an on-chain perspective.
One of the metrics AMBCrypto examined was the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD). This metric how far long-term coins are moving in large amounts.
HODLing continues as liquidity hunt begins
If the CDD is high, BTC might become extremely volatile, and selling pressure could cause a price decrease. This was the situation with Bitcoin on the 28th of May.
However, press time data showed that the CDD was down to 4.55 million. In this instance, long-term coins are not moving around as participants are sticking to holding.
Source: Glassnode
If this continues, then the bullish prediction of $74,400 might triumph over the potential decline to $68,050. To buttress this point, AMBCrypto also looked at the liquidation heatmap.
The heatmap can help traders identify high areas of liquidity. And if there is a magnetic area, the price can rise in that direction. At press time, there was a high level of liquidity at $70,300, suggesting that Bitcoin could hit the price.
Source: Hyblock

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

If attained, this could lead to a breakout to $74,500 where another magnetic zone existed. However, if the uptrend gets rejected, Bitcoin could slump as low as $65,050.
But by the look of things and metrics analyzed, BTC looks set to climb above $74,000.

JPMorgan Chase To Launch Biometric Payments Next Year, Enabling 'Pay With Your Face' Shopping: Report - The Daily Hodl


								JPMorgan Chase is reportedly preparing to launch a biometric payments system for the masses.
The banking giant is preparing a “broad rollout” of an authentication system that will allow retail shoppers to pay with their face or palm next year, reports American Banker.










The system is the result of two pilot projects with the California-based biometrics company PopID.
JPMorgan, which already provides point-of-sale solutions to merchants, says it ran pilot tests for the system at brick-and-mortar stores in the US as well as internally at an office cafeteria.
Jean-Marc Thienpont, head of omnichannel and biometric solutions at JPMorgan Payments, says the bank believes the system will reduce checkout time and boost security.
“At its heart, biometrics-based payments empowers our merchant clients to deliver a better customer payment experience. 
We are a trusted payments provider and financial institution worldwide, and fully equipped to manage the highly secure identification points that power biometrics solutions. The evolution of consumer technology has created new expectations for shoppers, and merchants need to be ready to adapt to these new expectations.”
A 2023 survey conducted by PYMNTS found 28% of consumers have used facial recognition for an online purchase in the last 30 days.
The business research firm Goode Intelligence projects 3 billion people will pay using biometrics by 2026, with global transactions hitting $5.765 trillion per year.

Fairshake Super PAC Gains $25 Million Boost from Coinbase


Coinbase, a popular crypto exchange in the US, announced an additional $25 million donation to Fairshake Super Political Action Committee (PAC) in a blog post. Coinbase stated that this fund aims to elect pro-crypto candidates and defend crypto users’ rights.
With this latest contribution, Fairshake and its affiliates have raised a total of $160 million this election cycle, making it one of the largest Super PACs.
Crypto Industry’s Influence Grows with Coinbase’s Donation

The donation reflects Coinbase’s strategy to expedite regulatory clarity through legislative and judicial means. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong emphasized the importance of electing pro-crypto candidates to overcome legislative gridlock and ensure the industry’s growth.

“For a bill to become law in the US, it must pass the House, Senate, and be signed into law by the President. And in our divided government, the default is that nothing will happen unless the cost of inaction is greater than doing the right thing. This leads us to an important conclusion: The best way to get regulatory clarity in democratic countries is to elect pro-crypto candidates on both sides of the aisle and to vote anti-crypto candidates out of office,” Armstrong said.

Before Coinbase, Ripple and venture capital firm a16z also donated to Fairshake. Other donors include Gemini’s Winklevoss twins, Jump Crypto, and Union Square Ventures. A report by Public Citizen found that digital asset-affiliated Super PACs, including Fairshake, raised the third-highest amount of all super PACs before the 2024 election.

List of Crypto Firms and Figures Who Donated to Fairshake Super PAC in 2023 – 2024. Source: OpenSecrets
In addition to contributing to Fairshake, Coinbase launched its nonprofit, Stand With Crypto, last August to advance pro-crypto legislation. Coinbase reported that, at the time of writing, StandWithCrypto.org boasts over 900,000 advocates nationwide. Remarkably, this reflects almost a doubling in its membership since May 10, when Stand With Crypto had nearly 500,000 members.

Crypto firms and key industry figures emphasize supporting pro-crypto candidates in the November elections. This move is crucial, given President Joe Biden’s administration’s stringent approach toward the crypto industry. Recently, Biden vetoed H.J. Res.109, a bill that would have overturned the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121).

“My Administration will not support measures that jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors. Appropriate guardrails that protect consumers and investors are necessary to harness the potential benefits and opportunities of crypto-asset innovation,” Biden said on May 31.

SAB 121 requires financial institutions to list customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets. Critics argue this mandate creates substantial operational and financial burdens for firms handling cryptocurrencies and exposes customers’ assets to risks in bankruptcy situations.

Funds used for attack ads against anti-crypto candidates.



Coinbase’s total donation to Fairshake hits $49 million.




According to Bloomberg, Coinbase donates to Super PAC with an extra $25M, which supports pro-crypto candidates, taking total donation to $49M.



 



Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, has donated a further $25 million to the Fairshake SuperPAC. 



The news was shared by the company’s chief executive officer, Brian Armstrong, in a blog post. The donation aims at contributing to an increase in contributions meant to support the election of candidates who are pro-digital assets.

Fairshake SuperPAC, along with its affiliates, managed to gather $160 million in this election cycle, according to Armstrong. 




Andreessen Horowitz, a venture-capital firm whose co-founder Marc Andreessen serves on Coinbase’s board, made a matching donation last week. Crypto firm Ripple made the same donation of $25 million.

Growing Political Influence of Crypto Industry in Upcoming Elections



In his blog post, Armstrong said crypto voters will not be taken seriously until they send a clear message that opposing crypto is a political liability. He stated that the aim is to support pro-crypto candidates from both parties and vote out anti-crypto ones.





Coinbase’s latest donation, which brings the company’s total donation to Fairshake to $49 million, underlines the growing political influence of the crypto industry during the upcoming presidential and congressional elections. 



The industry has often clashed with regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and has been advocating for new legislation to help crypto business in the US.

Bitcoin Sellers Running Out? Trader Realized Profit Dips 32%


								Data shows that Bitcoin short-term holders have seen a decrease in their realized profit, a sign that their appetite for harvesting gains may be diminishing.
Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Realizing Much Fewer Profits Now
As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the BTC short-term holders have been realizing much lower amounts of profits recently. The “short-term holders” (STHs) here refer to the Bitcoin investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days.
Statistically, the longer an investor holds their coins, the less likely they become to sell them. As the STHs are the new entrants in the market, they are unlikely to hold for too long.

Because of this weak resolve, the investors of this cohort tend to easily panic sell whenever something notable happens in the sector, like a rally or crash.
Naturally, the recent run towards the all-time high (ATH) also saw these fickle-minded holders selling. The chart below shows the trend in the “Realized Profit and Loss” indicator for this group, which tells us about the net amount of profit or loss that they have been harvesting recently.

The value of the metric seems to have observed a decline in recent months | Source: @AxelAdlerJr on X
As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin STH Realized Profit and Loss metric spiked to highly positive levels when the rally towards the ATH price occurred. More particularly, the indicator’s value hit the 42% mark at the peak of this profit-taking spree.
Since then, as the cryptocurrency price has struggled, the indicator’s value has dropped to just the 10%. As the analyst notes,
The realized profit of short-term holders has fallen by 32%, signaling a lack of investor desire to lock in profits at current levels, essentially anticipating further growth.
This development is potentially not the only positive one for Bitcoin recently. As Axel pointed out in another X post, the Realized Cap of the investors holding for less than a month has been on the rise.
The “Realized Cap” here basically refers to the total amount of capital that the investors have used to purchase the asset, as determined by data available on the blockchain.

As the chart below shows, this metric had earlier been declining for these young investors, even among the STHs, suggesting that fresh interest in the asset had been waning.

Looks like the value of the indicator has turned around in recent days | Source: @AxelAdlerJr on X
The Realized Cap for this cohort has recently found a reversal, a potential sign that some new demand is now flowing into the cryptocurrency.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $69,200, down over 1% in the past seven days.

Most cryptocurrency traders anticipate a significant market rally in 2024. Typically, established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum would lead the rally, while other lower market capitalization cryptos make the most significant moves to deliver exceptional profits.



From recent observations, JTO, PYTH, and ENA show potential to become the breakout stars of the upcoming bull run. Although they may be relatively unknown to many crypto users, their performances in the upcoming bull run may push them into the top echelon of the highly ranked altcoins. Let’s take a look at each of them.



Despite its relatively brief existence, Jito Network (JTO) has become one of the leading contributors in the Solana ecosystem. It is a staking protocol that allows users to exchange their SOL for JitoSOL, maintaining SOL’s liquidity and earning yield from staking.



JTO has had a bullish start in the crypto market, rallying over 270% in Q1 2024 before embarking on a slight retracement, according to TradingView’s data. Many crypto users expect the rally to continue, considering JTO’s connection with one of the most promising blockchains, Solana.



PYTH Network (PYTH) also caught the eyes of several crypto traders despite losing nearly all the gains it made earlier in the year. The first-party oracle network’s native token, PYTH, gained over 430% earlier in the year but has since retraced, losing 70% of the profit.



 
 




However, several users believe the newly launched crypto would rebound and reclaim the losses. That places PYTH as a crypto token that could offer significant gains in the upcoming bull run, especially if it climbs above its current all-time high to experience new price levels.



The Ethereum-based synthetic dollar, ENA, completes the list of three crypto tokens users are looking up to for significant rallies in the coming months. The newly launched token started with an impressive 413% rally in the first two weeks.



Early profit-taking saw ENA slump by 57% before finding support. The token’s low market capitalization positions it to rally significantly with increased adoption, considering its crypto-native solution for money that is not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure.

Kraken Sees Largest Bitcoin And Ethereum Outflows Since 2017, What's going On?


								Recent data shows that Kraken, one of the premier crypto exchanges in the market, has witnessed its largest outflows of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) since 2017. This signals a significant shift in digital asset holdings, which could have broad implications for the market.
Kraken’s Historic Outflows, What Is Going On?
Insights from Joao Wedson of Dominando Cripto shared on CryptoQuant’s quick-take platform highlight a startling trend at Kraken. The exchange recorded an outflow of 49,100 BTC, translating to approximately $3.33 billion.

This massive withdrawal marks the largest movement of funds from the exchange in dollar terms. Ethereum was not left behind, with roughly 572,100 ETH, valued at around $2.15 billion, also exiting the platform.
This substantial reduction has brought Kraken’s Bitcoin reserves down to levels last seen in 2018, holding about 122,300 BTC. Even more notably, Ethereum reserves have dipped below one million for the first time since early 2016.

While this news may initially seem alarming, Wedson reveals that address screenings indicate the asset movements were “synchronized and rapid,” suggesting these outflows might have been the strategic repositioning of reserves by Kraken itself, or part of an institutional strategy.
Anticipating A Supply Squeeze And Price Surge
Meanwhile, the timing of these movements is crucial, coming just as the market absorbs the impact of the SEC’s recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.
This regulatory nod has accelerated the reduction of ETH available on centralized exchanges, heightening anticipations of a possible supply squeeze that could positively influence Ethereum’s price.
The broader context involves a significant shift away from exchanges as the primary holders of crypto assets. Market analyst Ali noted a sharp decline in Ethereum held on exchanges, with about 777,000 ETH withdrawn post-ETF approval, hinting at an evolving market dynamic where major players might be moving towards greater self-custody amidst rising institutional involvement.

This trend is corroborated by a broader analysis of exchange balances, which shows a continuous decrease, suggesting a strengthening preference for holding cryptocurrencies outside exchange platforms.
Such movements are traditionally viewed as bullish indicators, implying reduced sell pressure and increased long-term holding behaviors among investors.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,777, following a peak of $3,850 in the last 24 hours. The current trading price represents a 0.7% increase in the past day despite a nearly 5% decline over the past week. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently priced at $69,253, having pulled back from a 24-hour high of $70,188.

Dogecoin vs Shiba Inu: Which memecoin will dominate June? - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin and Shiba Inu were pretty evenly matched across the metrics compared.
Shiba Inu was stuck in a range, while Dogecoin might pose risks to short-term holders.

The memecoin market has slumped over the past week following Bitcoin’s [BTC] hesitance to break past the $70k resistance.
CoinMarketCap data showed that only dogwifhat [WIF] had a positive price performance over the past week among the top five memecoins by market capitalization.
Dogecoin [DOGE] and Shiba Inu [SHIB] saw a similar price performance, but the latter was trading within a range. The former has been more volatile in May but has trended higher slightly more consistently.
Heading into June, which token is likely to see better returns?
Comparing the social metrics

The weighted sentiment gave an idea of whether the social media engagement was skewed bullish or bearish. The 3-day interval values for DOGE and SHIB were -0.72 and -0.74 respectively. This showed that engagement was similarly bearish for both coins.
However, looking at the trends, we can see Dogecoin has been consistently bearish since April. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu was more often positive over the past two months. This might be because Dogecoin witnessed more volatility.
The social dominance of DOGE was 0.927% compared to 0.339% for SHIB. This is also understandable since Dogecoin is the face of the meme coin sector and has been for years.
According to this metric, Dogecoin might witness more volatility soon

On the 30th of May, the dormant circulation of DOGE saw a massive spike. This indicated a flurry of tokens moving between wallets and is generally a sign of selling pressure.
DOGE prices have only slipped 3% since then, and at press time recovery was underway.
However, the potential wave of selling could be a concern.
On the other hand, Shiba Inu saw fewer tokens move on-chain in the past two months, highlighting a stronger HODL mentality.
Comparing the MVRV ratios, we see that DOGE was more negative over the past six weeks than SHIB. This meant DOGE holders faced greater losses, especially in early May.
At press time, it was the SHIB holders who were sitting on greater unrealized losses.

Realistic or not, here’s DOGE’s market cap in BTC’s terms

Overall, the social metrics were pretty similar. The MVRV ratios showed that DOGE holders were more willing to sell when the metric pushed above zero.
Combined with the dormant circulation spike, Dogecoin could see greater volatility than Shiba Inu.

This $3.5 Billion Deal Pushes Core Scientific Into AI


Core Scientific has announced a $3.5 billion, 12-year contract with the Nvidia-backed cloud service provider – CoreWeave. 
This significant partnership marks a strategic shift for Core Scientific as it ventures beyond Bitcoin mining into high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning. CoreWeave will also enhance Core Scientific’s existing infrastructure, making it apt for complex artificial intelligence (AI) applications.
Crypto Miners Diversify Into AI

This deal expands upon a pre-existing collaboration between the two firms. It aims to retrofit Core Scientific’s facilities into cutting-edge, application-specific data centers. These enhancements are crucial for advanced computing tasks that modern AI technologies demand.
Under the partnership’s financial terms, CoreWeave will handle all initial capital investments, including a significant $300 million allocated to infrastructure upgrades. These investments will be strategically recouped through hosting fees, providing financial relief and reducing risk exposure.
With estimated annual revenues of around $290 million from the contracts, Core Scientific anticipates a significant boost in earnings, enhancing shareholder value. Meanwhile, Core Scientific stock has been up by 40% year-to-date.
CEO Adam Sullivan highlighted the strategic foresight of this diversification. 


“Our expanding relationship with CoreWeave creates a pathway for Core Scientific to diversify our business model and balance our portfolio between Bitcoin mining and alternative compute hosting, positioning us to maximize cash flow and minimize risk while maintaining our significant exposure to Bitcoin’s upside potential,” Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan said.

The timing of this deal is pivotal, given Core Scientific’s recent emergence from bankruptcy prompted by the 2022 Bitcoin market collapse. Under Sullivan’s leadership, the company has navigated past financial challenges by restructuring debt and pivoting towards more sustainable business avenues.
Moreover, the agreement includes options for further expansion, allowing CoreWeave to increase its operational capacity at Core Scientific’s locations. These ongoing negotiations aim to secure additional contracts that would significantly boost Core Scientific’s capabilities.
The shift towards AI and HPC hosting is driven by the increasing demand for AI infrastructure, sparked by groundbreaking technologies such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. This surge has sparked a flurry of investments across the sector, with many companies, including Core Scientific’s peers such as Bit Digital, Iris Energy, and Hut 8, diversifying their revenue streams beyond traditional Bitcoin mining.

Industry experts affirm that AI operations require greater capital investment but also yield higher profits than Bitcoin mining. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, noted the strategic advantage for Bitcoin miners. 

“Bitcoin miners, often stationed in energy-secure and energy-intensive data centers, find these facilities ideal for AI operations as well,” Butterfill said.

Ethereum Whales Go on Buying Spree After SEC Greenlights Spot ETF


							

SEC approval of Ethereum Spot ETF leads to significant withdrawals of ETH from exchanges.



Analyst Burak Kesmeci suggests two reasons for the withdrawals.



This trend echoes similar occurrences observed after the approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETF.




The SEC’s approval of the Ethereum Spot ETF on May 24, 2024, has triggered increased movement of ETH holdings across crypto exchanges. As reported by Cryptoquant, approximately 800,000 ETH valued at $3 billion were withdrawn from exchanges within eight days. However, the identity of those responsible for these large-scale withdrawals remains unknown.



This trend echoes similar activity observed after the approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETF. Crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci offers two possible reasons for these massive withdrawals.



Kesmeci suggested that large market players, commonly called whales, may have anticipated a surge in Ethereum’s value following ETF approval. This outlook could have driven their decision to accumulate substantial holdings ahead of anticipated market movements.



The analyst also added that the heavy outflows could be caused by institutions positioning themselves for the launch of the ETH Spot ETF. As a result, these institutions may be bolstering their Ethereum reserves to meet investor demand upon the ETF’s launch.



Nonetheless, market experts expect the withdrawals to have a positive impact on Ethereum’s price trajectory in the medium term. The reduced circulation of ETH will likely exert upward price pressure, strengthening ETH’s bullish outlook in the coming months.



Insights from Intotheblock revealed heightened accumulation of Ethereum by whale investors. According to Intotheblock’s findings released on May 31st, 41% of crypto wallets now hold more than 1% of the total Ethereum. This figure represents a 36% increase from the first quarter of 2024. Moreover, the spike in ETH holdings indicates growing confidence among major stakeholders in Ethereum’s prospects.



Industry expert Michael Nadeau predicted a potential influx of institutional interest in Ethereum. Nadeau based his prediction on factors like the absence of structural selling pressures faced by Bitcoin miners, the Ethereum staking feature, and its pivotal role in the Web3 ecosystem.



Despite these promising developments, Ethereum was mostly flat on Monday. The cryptocurrency traded at $3,811, indicating a modest 0.89% increase over the past 24 hours.

AI And Bitcoin Mining: What Core Scientific's Unexpected Partnership With Nvidia-Backed AI Firm Coreweave Tells Us - Bitdeer Technologies (NASDAQ:BTDR) - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD miners are investing millions into artificial intelligence (AI) businesses, expecting billions in return as they diversify their operations.What Happened: According to a CNBC report on Monday, Core Scientific Inc. CORZ, a Bitcoin mining company, announced a 12-year deal with cloud provider CoreWeave to provide infrastructure for AI use cases. This agreement is expected to generate more than $3.5 billion in revenue over the contract period.CoreWeave, backed by AI chip giant Nvidia Corp. NVDA, rents out graphics processing units (GPUs), essential for training and running AI models. Core Scientific will provide about 200 megawatts of infrastructure to support CoreWeave’s operations.Core Scientific, which emerged from bankruptcy in January, has been mining a mix of digital assets since 2017. The company began diversifying into other services in 2019.Why It Matters: Core Scientific’s AI push follows similar move by another well-known Bitcoin mining firm, Bitdeer Technologies Group BTDR, which partnered with Nvidia to offer AI cloud computing servicesThe pivot towards AI by Bitcoin miners was triggered by the halving event in April, which halved the new issuance of Bitcoin. This event, designed to counter inflation, has historically preceded a significant surge in Bitcoin's price. Miners began turning to AI to mitigate the impact of the halving event.Other miners like Bit Digital, Hive, Hut 8, and TeraWulf are also looking to bolster their revenue streams after the Bitcoin halving in April cut rewards paid out to miners by 50%. Many are retrofitting their facilities to meet the needs of the AI market.According to CoinShares, Bit Digital derives 27% of its revenue from AI. Hut 8 generates 6% of sales from AI, and Hive, which has data centers in Canada and Sweden, gets 4% of its revenue from these services.Price Action: The shares of Core Scientific closed 2.53% higher at $4.87 during Monday’s regular trading session, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $69,192.81, up 1.32% in the last 24 hours.

Crypto Analyst PlanB: Bitcoin Set for $100,000 Surge, $500,000 Long-Term Target


							

PlanB analyzes the Bitcoin market using multiple indicators.



All of PlanB’s indicators suggest BTC is set to pump.



The analyst predicts Bitcoin would rally to $500,000 in the coming bull run.




Cryptocurrency analyst, PlanB has identified a developing trend in the Bitcoin cycle following the recent halving event. In a video upload, PlanB used multiple chart indicators, including his proprietary Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model (S2F), to compare BTC’s trend with past bull cycles.



Using the S2F model, PlanB demonstrated that Bitcoin is primed for the next leg of the bull run, having completed an initial phase shortly after last April’s halving event. Per the analysis, closing last month slightly above $67,000 confirms the start of the new cycle. The analyst predicts Bitcoin will surge similarly to the previous halving cycle, forecasting a $500,000 target for the flagship cryptocurrency in the upcoming bull cycle.



Meanwhile, PlanB shared details of the Bitcoin Market Cycle indicator, confirming the market has entered a bull cycle. However, he advised his followers to remain patient until the price begins to rise rapidly. Similarly, he noted a Relative Strength Index (RSI) increase that resembles the indicator’s performance ahead of the 2012 bull run. PlanB highlighted that the RSI signal is in an early stage and provides valuable information to traders.









Continuing his analysis, PlanB posted the Bitcoin 200 Week Moving Average (WMA), showing it is in a rising trend that he expects to continue. The analyst showed how the 200 WMA trend coincides with a bull market signal to confirm the potential Bitcoin surge. He believes that the signal is enough to push Bitcoin to $100,000 soon.



Using the Bitcoin Realized Price indicator, PlanB further supported his bullish prediction for Bitcoin. He compared the indicator’s trend with historical data, showing that its current level suggests the imminent start of a Bitcoin rally. He used the indicator’s behavior to predict Bitcoin would not drop below $64,000 before embarking on the expected price increase.

Legendary Trader Peter Brandt Says Bitcoin Could Rally to $150,000 Before Bull Market Ends - Here’s His Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes that Bitcoin (BTC) can soar to a high of $150,000 before the bull market comes to a close.
In a new blog post, Brandt says the timeline of each bull cycle has been more or less the same since 2012.










“The number of weeks from the start of each bull market cycle (the low following a 75%-plus decline) to the halving dates has been almost equal to the number of weeks from the halving dates to the subsequent bull market highs.” 
If Bitcoin continues to follow the script, Brandt predicts that the current bull market will expire in August or September 2025.
As for his BTC price target, Brandt says the bull market highs since 2012 can be tracked using an inverted parabolic curve. The seasoned trader shares a chart suggesting that Bitcoin may rise to as high as $150,000 at his predicted bull market expiration date.
Source: Peter Brandt
But Brandt warns that his analysis is not foolproof. He also says that there’s a 25% chance that BTC has already printed the top for this cycle.
“Should Bitcoin fail to make a decisive new ATH (all-time high) and decline below $55,000 I will raise the probability of the Exponential Decay.” 
The trader defines exponential decay as BTC losing about 80% of its exponential energy after each successful bull market.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $69,083.

Edward Snowden Makes A Bold Statement On Bitcoin: Details


								On Monday, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden once again expressed his support for Bitcoin (BTC). Snowden’s statement came in the wake of a significant market disruption that saw Berkshire Hathaway shares plummet by 99% due to a technical glitch on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This incident has reignited discussions about the robustness and reliability of traditional financial systems versus decentralized alternatives.
Bitcoin Fixes This
A technical glitch on the NYSE triggered extreme price swings in several securities, causing a temporary suspension of trading. Approximately two hours after the NYSE halted trading, it was reported that all systems were operational again.
Among the affected securities, shares of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett‘s storied investment company, and Barrick Gold, a major mining group, experienced dramatic and erroneous declines of around 99% in value. Berkshire Hathaway shares, which typically trade at more than $622,000, dropped precipitously to just $185 due to the glitch. This erroneous pricing was later corrected.

The NYSE attributed the turmoil to “technical difficulties” with the limit-up/limit-down mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to curb unusually large price fluctuations during trading sessions. Introduced after the 2010 flash crash, where a selling wave triggered by computer algorithms wiped out a trillion dollars in market value within minutes, these mechanisms are critical in maintaining market stability. Intercontinental Exchange, the NYSE’s operator, reported no indications of a hacker attack.
In response to this event, Edward Snowden took to X, simply stating, “Bitcoin fixes this.” Snowden’s terse comment underscores his belief in the advantages of decentralized financial systems over traditional, centralized exchanges.


Bitcoin, as a decentralized digital currency, operates on a peer-to-peer network without a central authority. This structure contrasts sharply with traditional stock exchanges, where centralized control can lead to systemic risks, such as those demonstrated by the recent NYSE glitch. The design of Bitcoin aims to ensure transparency, immutability, and security, reducing the potential for such catastrophic failures due to technical issues or centralized errors.

Snowden’s endorsement of Bitcoin in this context highlights the cryptocurrency’s resilience against the vulnerabilities that can plague traditional financial systems. By pointing out that “Bitcoin fixes this,” Snowden implies that BTC’s decentralized nature could potentially prevent similar disruptions in the financial system, offering a more reliable alternative to traditional trading platforms.
Notably, Bitcoin boasts an uptime of 99.989% since its inception. This remarkable level of reliability is a testament to the robustness of its underlying blockchain technology. There have been only two incidents in BTC’s early days: the first in 2010, known as the “value overflow incident,” where a bug created billions of BTC out of thin air, and the second in 2013, involving a temporary blockchain fork caused by an incompatible software upgrade. Both incidents were swiftly addressed by the core developers, reinforcing Bitcoin’s resilience.
At press time, BTC traded at $69,047.

Statement on the Giant US Organization Announcing Bitcoin Investment: Will Acquisitions Continue? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Wisconsin's pension program will significantly increase its investments in Bitcoin ETFs, according to David Krause, a finance professor at Marquette University in the US.
The state's pension program added two spot Bitcoin ETFs to its portfolio in the first quarter, marking the beginning of its foray into cryptocurrency investments.


The Wisconsin State Investment Board (SWIB) purchased shares of BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) worth $164 million as of March 31, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May. .
The move surprised the industry, as large institutions, especially pensions, generally do not invest in junior ETFs such as spot Bitcoin ETFs. But the state's investment board has a history of being ahead of the curve, Krause noted in an interview with PBS Wisconsin:






“Wisconsin's board of investments has always been innovative. It's a fully funded retirement fund, so in a sense they have the luxury of being able to invest for the long term. “They don't have to worry about liquidity as much as, say, the Illinois state pension fund, which is only 50% funded.”


As of the end of 2023, SWIB was managing roughly $156 billion in assets, meaning its holdings in Bitcoin ETFs were a negligible roughly 0.1% of its portfolio. However, Krause believes that this investment is just a “start” and expects SWIB to increase this amount and other pension funds to follow suit:

“I think it's just an entry point. “I think they're testing whether the public will be resistant to owning this and using it as an experiment because it won't really significantly impact the portfolio until it gets to maybe a 1% or 2% position.”

JPEX Scandal: Victims Fight to Reclaim $700,000 in Hong Kong Court


							

Two individuals have filed a lawsuit seeking recovery of $700K from JPEX.



Technology legal specialist Joshua Chu Kiu-wah represents the plaintiff.



Felix Chiu King-yin, general manager at exchange Coingaroo, has also been named.




Two individuals connected to the JPEX scandal have filed a lawsuit in Hong Kong courts seeking to recover HK$5.5 million (approximately $703,300).



The lawsuit names plaintiffs Herbert Lee Sung-him and Chan Wing-yan against JPEX Crypto Asset Platform, a firm accused of financial fraud totaling HK$1.6 billion, and its associated entity, Web 3.0 Technical Support.



The plaintiffs are also seeking to hold accountable “any persons who carried out or assisted in the scheme,” including three wallet address holders linked to the JPEX platform.



Felix Chiu King-yin, general manager at Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange Coingaroo, which reportedly has operational ties to JPEX, is also named as a defendant.



Chan alleges that she paid Chiu HK$1,850,000 (equivalent to $237,179), part of which he converted into 195,499 USDT (Tether) and deposited into a JPEX wallet. She also told police that she made several deposits totaling 247,498 USDT to two JPEX wallets in July and August of last year, only to find the assets transferred within five minutes of each deposit.









The plaintiffs claim that the deposited assets were moved to dozens of unknown wallets before they checked their accounts on September 14th of last year. They are also seeking to recover another 226,012 USDT, which they say was converted to other cryptocurrencies without authorization.



The plaintiffs are asking the court to trace the lost funds and issue an injunction to freeze the cryptocurrency held on various platforms. Technology legal specialist Joshua Chu Kiu-wah is representing the plaintiffs.

Binance Implements MiCA Stablecoin Rules in Europe, CZ Addresses Delisting Concerns


							

The MiCA stablecoin rules will come into effect across the EEA from June 30, 2024.



The new rules will implement restrictions on unregulated stablecoins while promoting regulated stablecoins.



Binance will allow the transition of unregulated stablecoins to regulated stablecoins over time.




Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is implementing new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) stablecoin rules across the European Economic Area (EEA). The MiCA rules, effective June 30, 2024, mark a significant shift in the stablecoin market, with new regulations designed to enhance market governance.



In a blog post, Binance detailed the impact of the new MiCA stablecoin rules on the EEA’s crypto ecosystem. The platform stated, “This marks a first step into the new regulatory framework and will significantly impact the stablecoin market in the EEA.”



While the MiCA rules are expected to restrict “unauthorized stablecoins” and foster “regulated stablecoins,” Binance has decided to allow the transition of unregulated stablecoins to regulated stablecoins over time. The exchange added:




“Our transitional approach has been designed to minimize any potential harmful impacts to the EEA and global crypto market that could arise from users rushing to swap their stablecoin holdings while limited exit avenues exist.”










Meanwhile, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao addressed a key concern regarding the platform’s strategies for the MiCA rules on X social platform stating, “Binance will not delist any unauthorized stablecoins from spot trading but will limit their availability for EEA users only on certain products.”







In related news, Binance France has undergone a significant restructuring. Following the imprisonment of its sole owner, Changpeng Zhao, for four months due to alleged money laundering violations, Yulong Yan and Lihua He have become the new shareholders, each with a 50% stake in Binance France. This strategic decision comes as the EEA prepares to embrace the new MiCA stablecoin rules.

Bitcoin ETF Wars: BlackRock, Fidelity Gain Ground on Vanguard as Grayscale Lags


							

26% of inflows in BlackRock and 56% in Fidelity came from BTC ETFs.



Vanguard remains the leader in total ETF inflows for 2024, at $102.8 billion.



IBIT has attracted $16.6 billion in inflows, while FBTC has seen $8.9 billion.




BlackRock’s and Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETFs are driving significant inflows for the firms, accounting for 26% and 56% of their respective year-to-date totals, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data cited by Eric Balchunas.



The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which launched in January, have attracted $16.6 billion and $8.9 billion in inflows, respectively, according to Farside Investor data.



Balchunas noted that the Bitcoin ETFs are “definitely having an impact on the leaderboard” due to these significant inflows.



However, Vanguard, which does not offer any Bitcoin ETFs, still leads in total ETF inflows for 2024 with $102.8 billion, far surpassing BlackRock’s $65.1 billion.



BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, manages 429 ETFs with a combined $2.8 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM). Fidelity manages 70 ETFs totaling $74 billion in AUM.









Another ETF issuer, Invesco, recorded $34.7 billion in ETF flows this year, with its Bitcoin ETF contributing only 0.9% to this total, or $317.3 million, in the first five months.



Notably, IBIT recently surpassed the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as the world’s largest spot Bitcoin ETF. As of May 28, IBIT holds 291,567 BTC, valued at over $20 billion.



Meanwhile, Grayscale, which initially held 620,000 Bitcoin in January, has experienced significant outflows, reducing its holdings to 285,139 BTC, worth approximately $19.6 billion.

Shiba Inu Devs Warn of Treat Token Scams on Shibaswap


							

Deceptive tokens are falsely claiming association with Shiba developers and exploiting Shib.io address.



Shibarium developers stress that the Treat token has not been launched yet.



Shibaswap’s decentralized nature prevents banning fraudulent tokens, but developers strongly disapprove of these scams.




The Shibarium community is on high alert as reports surface of fraudulent tokens claiming false associations with Shiba Inu developers. These bad actors are exploiting Shibarium’s decentralized platform to promote their schemes, posing significant risks to investors. DaVinci, a prominent figure in the Shibarium community, has issued a stern warning to all members, urging them to exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough research before interacting with any new tokens.







Moreover, these scammers have shifted tactics, moving from misusing Ryoshi Research mediums to exploiting Shiba State and Canine Code. Alarmingly, they have even resorted to posting the shib.io address in their videos to lend false credibility to their schemes. This deliberate misuse aims to deceive community members into believing these fraudulent tokens have legitimate ties to the Shiba Inu ecosystem.



The developers have emphasized that the Treat token has not yet launched. Any tokens claiming association with Treat are unequivocally attempts to deceive and defraud the community. Despite the decentralized nature of Shibaswap, which prevents it from banning these tokens, the developers remain committed to voicing strong disapproval of such unethical practices.



 
 




Notably, the warning from the creators coincides with considerable price fluctuations for the SHIB cryptocurrency. With a trading volume of $480,822,87, Shiba Inu is currently priced at $0.000025, recording an increase of 0.82% in the last day. This increase in value highlights the need for caution because volatile markets may increase the public’s vulnerability to fraudulent schemes.



The developers’ advisory highlights the necessity for community members to remain vigilant and informed. By thoroughly researching and confirming the legitimacy of any tokens before interacting with them, investors can safeguard themselves against such scams. The community is advised to rely solely on official channels and reliable sources when seeking information about reputable advancements in the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

Bitcoin Mining Company Core Scientific Signed a $3.5 Billion Agreement with the Artificial Intelligence Company! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Core Scientific, North America's leading provider of Bitcoin mining and hosting services, today announced that it has signed a series of significant 12-year agreements with AI hyperscaler CoreWeave.
Core Scientific Signed a 12-Year Agreement with Artificial Intelligence Company
The Nasdaq-listed company anticipates these deals will generate an estimated $3.5 billion in total cumulative revenue over the life of the agreements, with annual revenue averaging $290 million.


Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan emphasized the strategic importance of this agreement and said:
“Our expanding relationship with CoreWeave creates a way for Core Scientific to diversify our business model and balance our portfolio between Bitcoin mining and alternative computing hosting.





“This gives us significant exposure to Bitcoin's upside potential while positioning us to maximize cash flow and minimize risk.”

Under the agreement, Core Scientific will provide 200 megawatts of infrastructure and renovate its existing sites to accommodate CoreWeave's operations.


The mining company aims to have these facilities operational by the first half of 2025. CoreWeave will fund all capital investments necessary to replace Core Scientific's existing infrastructure.
To offset these costs, CoreWeave plans to loan Core Scientific an estimated $300 million, which will be deducted gradually from monthly hosting fees.





Bitcoin mining companies, including Core Scientific, are exploring ways to expand their revenue streams following April's Bitcoin halving, which slashed miner rewards by 50%.
Other major mining companies such as Bit Digital and Hut 8 are also turning to artificial intelligence to increase their revenues.

Binance Faces User Backlash After $1 Million Hack Allegations


							

A Binance user lost about $1 million in a security breach while the hacker executed counter-trading techniques.



Binance asserts that the victim’s personal computer was hacked, and the platform cannot provide compensation.



The exchange also states that it processed the user’s request to freeze his account within 1 minute and 19 seconds.




In a recent X post, a Binance user, Nakamao identified himself as a “victim of an undercover agent,” claiming to have lost $1 million due to a security breach. The user alleged that the exploit was carried out by a malicious Chrome plugin that used counter-trading techniques to drain his account.



Nakamao shared his harrowing experience of the hack and expressed his despair at Binance’s alleged lack of response. He stated, “During the whole process, I did not receive any security reminders from Binance.”







However, in response to the user’s complaint, Binance asserted that the incident was likely the result of a hack on Nakamao’s computer. The platform also added that they processed the user’s request to freeze his account in 1 minute and 19 seconds.







Elaborating on the exploiter’s strategy, Binance stated that the hacker gained access to the user’s account login status and impersonated Nakamao to execute trades. The platform added, “Since the hacker could not withdraw the currency, they chose to use counter-trading to deplete your account assets.”



Furthermore, Binance asserted that the exchange has not identified any similar issues prior to this incident. While assuring to bolster its investigations, Binance stated that it cannot compensate for the losses as it was not their fault. The post read:




 “We sympathize with your experience, but according to the information we have learned so far, the reason for your asset loss is that your related devices were manipulated because of the installation of malicious plug-ins. Unfortunately, we have no way to compensate for such cases that have nothing to do with Binance.” 




On February 29, another Binance user shared his experience of losing almost $70,000. The user reported receiving notifications of orders being filled despite never having placed any. The user then witnessed their account holdings vanish.

Mt. Gox Bitcoin transfers of USD 9.2 billion rattle the market - Crypto Valley Journal

A summarizing review of what has been happening at the crypto markets. A look at trending sectors, liquidity, volatility, spreads and more. The weekly report in cooperation with market data provider Kaiko.Although we're still waiting for a spot ETH ETF launch date, a leveraged ETH ETF is set to debut on Tuesday. Elsewhere, US President Joe Biden vetoed the resolution to overturn the SAB 121 over the weekend, as expected. This week we explore:Mt. Gox Bitcoin transfers and the potential market impact from repayments.How trade volumes fare during the summer months.ETH's outperformance on ETF approval.Mt. Gox Bitcoin transfersLast Tuesday, wallets linked to the defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox initiated transfers of 140,000 BTC, valued at around $9.2 billion, as the bankruptcy estate prepares to repay creditors. This unexpected activity from dormant accounts triggered a wave of selling pressure in the market. A reliable indicator of such selling pressure is the cumulative volume delta (CVD), which for BTC recorded a total of negative $120 million between Sunday and Wednesday. This indicates a higher number of sellers than buyers.BTC CVD indicates net selling / Source: KaikoBreaking down the volume by hour shows that the amount of trading activity increased substantially on May 28, following the initial transfers from the Mt. Gox wallets. Hourly selling activity heavily outweighed buying between Tuesday and Wednesday of last week, leading to a large negative CVD for BTC.Mt. Gox will repay creditors in BTC, BCH, and fiat currency. The creditor's decision to sell their holdings is uncertain and will likely depend on the market's ability to absorb large orders. Fortunately, the market depth for BTC and BCH has improved by roughly 30%, reaching pre-FTX collapse levels, which may help mitigate potential price fluctuations if the sell-off occurs soon. However, looking at the dollar amount of available liquidity, the divergence between the two assets is striking.Bitcoin Cash has significantly lower liquidity than Bitcoin, with a daily average depth of only $9 million or 3.5% of Bitcoin's depth. Despite benefiting from the recent bull run and the launch of EDX, a Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Citadel Securities-backed exchange last year, BCH underperformed in Kaiko's latest liquidity ranking.Currently, BCH's bid-side depth is just $4.8 million, meaning that sell orders of the same magnitude could cause a 1% decline in the BCH price. BCH's market depth is substantially lower than its level in September 2021 when prices were similar.This suggests that Mt Gox repayments could have a significant impact on BCH should creditors sell their assets.Bitcoin enters summer doldrumsAs we enter June, both crypto and traditional financial markets are experiencing the typical summer trading lull. Historically, Q3 has had the lowest volume by a significant margin, with cumulative BTC trade volume over 40% below the highest-volume quarter.This trend has been particularly pronounced for BTC-USD volumes, which reached a multi-year low of $44 billion in Q3 2023, despite BlackRock's spot ETF filing. Tightening regulations and worsening liquidity infrastructure following the US banking turmoil could be partly responsible.However, with the launch of 11 spot ETFs in the United States, which has been beneficial for BTC price discovery and liquidity already, there is hope that this summer's volumes will not be as low as in the past. Nevertheless, the increasing interconnectedness between cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets could pose risks and potentially exacerbate the trend of low-volume trading.As previously mentioned, daily Bitcoin liquidity has become more concentrated around US trading hours, with volumes spiking at the market open (14H UTC) and close (20H UTC). This trend is likely linked to Bitcoin ETFs, which calculate their net asset value (NAV) against dedicated benchmarks at the US close each weekday, encouraging arbitrage and price discovery.The share of cumulative trade volume between 19H and 20H UTC has increased to 7.2% this year, up from 5.7% during the 2021 bull run. In contrast, Bitcoin trading during Hong Kong and Sydney market closes has declined. This concentration of liquidity in a short time frame could potentially increase intra-day volatility, especially during periods of market stress.USD trade volume gains tractionThe share of USD crypto volume, relative to other fiat currencies, has surged from 30% in September 2023 to over 50% in early May, driven by rising institutional interest in spot BTC ETFs. As a result, the USD is outperforming other fiat currencies, such as the KRW and EUR.Meanwhile, KRW trade volume lost momentum in Q2, after briefly surpassing USD volumes in Q1. Interestingly, the Turkish Lira (TRY) has overtaken the EUR and is now the third-largest fiat currency in terms of volume, highlighting the growing adoption of crypto assets in emerging markets.ETH outperforms on ETF newsThe ETH to BTC ratio, which measures the relative performance of the two assets, had been trending downwards since March. However, following the SEC's approval of 19b-4 filings from multiple US exchanges, ETH outperformed BTC, with the ratio spiking above 0.055 that day.ETH's ETF nod has thus far proven to be bad news for SOL. The SOL to ETH ratio fell to its lowest point since April following the SEC's decision on May 23, despite SOL's increased network activity earlier in 2024.Bitcoin ETF inflows pick upThe nine new Bitcoin ETFs saw a reversal from April's negative trend, with positive inflows in May. Last month, major funds made 13F filings that revealed some impressive Bitcoin ETF statistics. For instance, BlackRock's IBIT attracted over 400 institutional investors, including hedge fund Millennium, and surpassed Grayscale's GBTC as the world's largest spot Bitcoin ETF last week. Although 13F filings only offer a glimpse of funds' portfolios as of March, the institutional demand has been viewed as an encouraging factor by most market participants.

Galaxy Digital's Loan: Tokenization of a 316-Year-Old Violin


Galaxy Digital Holdings, spearheaded by billionaire Michael Novogratz, has innovatively expanded its lending services. The company recently issued a multimillion-dollar loan secured by a 316-year-old Stradivarius violin.
Russian Empress Catherine the Great once owned the Stradivarius violin. Last year, Yat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands, bought this historic instrument for over $9 million at an auction.
Galaxy Digital Pioneers Lending Funds Through Tokenized Assets

The loan collateral includes the Stradivarius violin and its digital representation as a non-fungible token (NFT). This dual-collateral strategy ensures robust security for Galaxy Digital while providing asset management flexibility. The physical violin will remain under custodianship in Hong Kong, with stringent requirements for its removal.
Tokenization, the process behind this innovative collateral, involves converting physical assets into digital tokens. Consequently, traders can trade and manage these tokens on blockchain platforms. In the digital economy, this method is becoming increasingly popular for managing various assets, from art to real estate.

Although immediate plans for fractional ownership of the violin are not set, Siu is interested in eventually enabling broader access to such unique assets. Thomas Cowan, vice president of tokenization at Galaxy Digital, highlighted the benefits. 

“Tokenizing physical assets like fine art or musical instruments allows us to lend potentially more for our clients than against more volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Today, it’s a violin, but tomorrow, it could be real estate,” Cowan said.


The interest in asset tokenization is also gaining traction among major financial institutions. For example, BlackRock has made a significant move by investing in Securitize, a company that specializes in the tokenization of real-world assets. This investment signifies a growing institutional interest in leveraging blockchain technology for more traditional financial practices.
BlackRock has also launched its first tokenized fund on Ethereum, marking a significant step towards integrating blockchain into mainstream asset management. This fund focuses on providing liquidity while maintaining stable value, distributing dividends as new tokens directly to investors’ wallets.
Read more: What is The Impact of Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization?
Moreover, the tokenization of real-world assets is not limited to private companies. El Salvador, for instance, has made strides with a tokenization initiative to finance a new hotel project. This effort is part of a broader move to harness blockchain technology for traditional sectors.

An In-Depth Look Into Mt. Gox's Recent $9.4 Billion Bitcoin Move: What Happens to the Crypto Market? ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Mt. Gox, a defunct crypto exchange, was spotted moving $9.62 billion worth of Bitcoin into a new wallet. This action has raised hopes among its creditors for potential repayments.



The transfer saw 141,686 Bitcoin transferred into the wallet “1Jbez” from various cold portfolios linked to the exchange. Moreover, it marks Mt. Gox’s first funds transfer in over five years, following its plans to reimburse creditors by the end of October 2024.



Anndy Lian, a blockchain expert and author of “NFT: From Zero to Hero,” noted that this significant transfer likely indicates Mt. Gox’s intention to repay its users. Lian emphasized that this movement is also part of the exchange’s strategy to reimburse creditors by the promised October 31, 2024 deadline.



Meanwhile, Mt. Gox rehabilitation trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi confirmed that the consolidation is part of the exchange’s repayment plans. In a May 28 announcement, Kobayashi stated that the Rehabilitation Trustee is preparing to repay the portion of cryptocurrency claims allocated for repayment. He also requested that creditors remain patient, hinting at potential delays beyond the initial deadline of September 2023.



Over the past ten years, creditors have been hoping for reimbursement of Mt. Gox’s outstanding debt amounting to $9.4 billion worth of BTC. The exchange was once a major cryptocurrency player, facilitating more than 70% of all trades in the early days of Bitcoin. However, Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014 following a series of hacks.

Potential Market Impact of Mt. Gox Bitcoin Transfers Analyzed by CryptoQuant



Reacting to the development, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant analyzed its potential impact on the crypto market. CryptoQuant reported that the Mt. Gox Rehabilitation Trustee had moved 138,000 Bitcoin in seven transactions, ranging between 4,000 and 32,000. 



The internal transfers within Trustee-controlled addresses have not impacted the Bitcoin market. Nonetheless, the analytics firm noted that the eventual repayment to creditors, expected by October 31, 2024, could influence market dynamics.



Furthermore, CryptoQuant highlighted that the market impact will depend on these repayments’ timing, size, and manner. If the Trustee starts repaying creditors, it could introduce a significant amount of Bitcoin into the market, affecting liquidity and price stability. The firm concluded that there is no immediate selling pressure from these movements since the transfers have yet to hit the open market.

Epoch Times CFO Bill Guan Charged With $67M Fraud Scheme Involving Crypto Platform

“Under Guan’s management, members of the team and others used cryptocurrency to knowingly purchase tens of millions of dollars in crime proceeds, including proceeds of fraudulently obtained unemployment insurance benefits, that had been loaded onto tens of thousands of prepaid debit cards,” DoJ said.
