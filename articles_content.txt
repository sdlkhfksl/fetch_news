Bitcoin Jumps Above $61,000 as US Unemployment Rate Rises With Fewer-Than-Expected Jobs Added - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin (BTC) is surging past the $61,000 price level as new data reveals that unemployment is on the rise in the US.
According to a new economic news release from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), fewer-than-expected nonfarm jobs were added in the US during the month of April, contributing to the unemployment rate rising from 3.8% to 3.9%.










“Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 175,000 in April, and the unemployment rate changed little at 3.9 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Job gains occurred in health care, in social assistance, and in transportation and warehousing… 
Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult men (3.6 percent) increased in April.” 
However, the data also reveals that hourly wages for nonfarm workers are on the rise as the average hourly earnings increased by $0.07 during the month of April. Over the last year, their average hourly earnings have gone up nearly 4%.
Though the US was able to add 175,000 jobs during the month of April, it missed the mark as CNBC reports the Dow Jones consensus estimate was that about 240,000 jobs would be created.
News of the unemployment data coincided with the top crypto asset by market cap skyrocketing in price. The crypto king is trading for $61,428 at time of writing, a 3.6% increase during the last 24 hours. On January 23rd, BTC was valued at $39,833.

Binance Burns 1.5B LUNC in Quest to Reduce Overprinted Supply - DailyCoin


        
Binance’s latest LUNC burn removes 1.5B coins from LUNC circulation.



Terra Luna Classic’s trading volume significantly dropped since March.



Analysts measure LUNC’s breakout chances based on a triple bottom.
Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) has received a strong boost from Binance, the leading crypto exchange by trading volume. Ever since Terra’s blockchain experienced a devastating crisis in May 2022, the exchange has taken it upon itself to reduce the overprinted supply of LUNC.Revitalization Efforts Post-UST CrashWhile the collapse has led to both Terra (LUNA) and Terra USD (UST) crumbling to pieces, the blockchain’s original coins were relaunched as Terra Luna Classic and Terra Classic USD (USTC). As TerraForm Labs focused on Terra 2.0 before going bankrupt, the classic Terra tokens were given to the LUNC community.As a method of bolstering recovery, Binance’s founder and former CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao lent a helping hand and explained that “minting, forking, don’t create value. Buying back, burning does, but it requires funds.” Since then, 21 LUNC burning batches have been conducted.With the latest Terra Classic burn ceremony on May 1, Binance has destroyed 1.5B tokens. According to on-chain records, this latest burning puts Terra Luna Classic’s remaining supply at 5,799,881,270,168 tokens.Can LUNC Make It Back to TOP 100?According to Binance’s burning strategy, the crypto exchange utilizes LUNC’s trading fees in relevant Spot pairs. This initiative inspired stakers and validators to approach other crypto exchanges to set up an all-around LUNC burning policy.In addition, the community aims to coordinate burns involving USTC, as the depegged algorithmic stablecoin is still trading below two cents. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency chart analysts believe that LUNC’s make-or-break moment underlies the $0.00013 price range.According to crypto trader Derek, LUNC is attempting to break out from short-term support, depicted in the graph above with three green-colored upward arrows. Breaking past this momentary support line on May 2, 2024, LUNC now trades at $0.0001045, with a 3.4% upswing over the past 24 hours.
The trader believes a stronger bounce back to the $0.00016 level is on the cards if LUNC manages to close the week above $0.000103. Hence, a gradual upward trajectory to reclaim a $1bn market cap could put LUNC back in the TOP 100. In contrast to today’s LUNC outbreak, the altcoin is still 25.5% down over the past 30 days.On the Flipside
Binance managed to collect a significantly lower amount of trading fees in the 21st Terra Luna Classic burn ceremony on May 1, 2024.



To compare, a gargantuan 4.17B LUNC tokens were burnt in March converting to $722.6K as LUNC daily trades hemmed in over $100M per day.
Why This MattersDespite falling out from the TOP 100 by market cap, Terra Luna Classic’s coordinated rejuvenation efforts continue with assistance from community developers and major crypto exchanges.Discover DailyCoin’s popular crypto news:Kraken’s Indices Unit Claims 50% of Crypto Benchmarking MarketAltcoin Season: Tips and Tactics for Market Research

ZKasino Scam: Dutch authorities arrest rug pull member | Cryptopolitan

Though crypto has been used for positive purposes across the globe, its negative use is nothing new. It has been used for different criminal activities, including scams. Dutch authorities announced recently that they have arrested a 26-year-old man allegedly for rug pull in betting platform ZKasino. ZKasino ScamZKasino is a betting platform that can be used for online gambling using crypto. There is a range of tools and templates that can allow a range of users to work on crypto betting. Furthermore, there is no need to have coding experience. It enables users to transfer tokens between Ethereum and ZKasino chain. It is globally ranked 38th for gambling in online platforms. Furthermore, it is useable on a range of programs which include Arbitrum, Fantom, Polygon, etc. The negative side of this platform is that there is no need for KYC, signups, and other procedures. As the result of no verification, there is a possibility of rug pulls and other scams happening to the customers. Though the company claims to have fairness and transparency, there are various incidents where the users were scammed. In a recent development, Dutch authorities announced that they have arrested a 26-year-old linked to ZKasino. The mentioned person has been alleged for scamming a number of people through rug pull.  Arrest of Zkasino memberThe arrest of the alleged ZKasino member was announced through the FIOD website. Financial crime authorities raided the mentioned person’s house and searched it. The raiding party seized various records which included physical and digital records.

The value of assets seized amounted to 11.4 million euros (12.2 million). The assets seized belonged to different types ranging from real estate to crypto as per the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service of the Netherlands (FIOD) statement. The detailed statement said that there is a possibility of discovery and seizure of more assets. There is no clear mention of how the alleged person was involved in this scam. ZKasino had initially announced that it will allow token redeeming but it backed out of its promise soon after launch. Thus, users weren’t able to reclaim their tokens, creating a big controversy. There were about 10,000 investors at the time of the launch of ZKasino, who had bridged tokens worth $33 million. It was clear from the change in policy that ZKasino was clearly a rug-pull scam. Dutch authorities wrote in the official statement that the investors were promised a return of their assets in 30 days but it didn’t happen. Furthermore, the technical details of the smart contract is the proof that it wasn’t designed to return the assets. The statement also said that the suspect was being examined by a magistrate and the detention has been extended for two weeks. Authorities expect that a breakthrough regarding the scam will happen. Affected to be repaidThe investigation is likely to continue and once the details are complete regarding the keys, the repatriation of funds will take place. Though it will take time there are increased chances that the repatriation of assets to the ZKasino affectees will take place. The alleged person had been in focus of authorities since 25 April and the outcoming details show that it won’t take much time to solve. ConclusionDutch authorities have announced that they have arrested a suspect related to rug pull scam ZKasino. The mentioned platform announced return of assets after thirty days but it didn’t happen. The arrest of its member has been a breakthrough and there is a chance that the affectees might get thier funds back.

US job growth slows as Bitcoin price soars past $62,000


Bitcoin surged past US$62,000 on Friday, as data from the United States Labor Department reported the unemployment rate rising to 3.9% last month.



In April, the U.S. economy’s job growth decelerated, with the creation of 175,000 non-farm jobs falling short of the 243,000 jobs forecasted.



The Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates steady has contributed to the softening of the U.S. dollar and Bitcoin’s rebound.



Bitcoin, which fell to as low as US$56,800 this week, traded at US$61,678 at 2:30 p.m. ET, according to CoinGeck.

	
	
	
	


Bitcoin’s rebound follows multiple positive developments for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, including the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong on Tuesday.



The Bitcoin network underwent the quadrennial halving on April 20, cutting miner rewards by 50% from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoins.



The halving impacts the scarcity of the asset by slowing down the inflow of new Bitcoins.



The launch of Runes, which is a new fungible token protocol on Bitcoin, also coincided with the halving.

Solana to join Bitcoin and Ethereum as top crypto assets, $1.6 trillion asset manager predicts - Crypto Briefing




Franklin Templeton, a global investment firm managing 1.6 trillion dollars, has released a report titled “Solana: Accelerated Adoption,” which predicts that Solana is positioned to become the third major crypto asset after Bitcoin and Ethereum.The report states, “Our view is that Solana’s growth is likely to continue because it is well positioned to capture the next wave of crypto adoption, solidifying itself as the third major crypto asset after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).”The analysts highlight that Solana has dominated in capturing the surge of crypto activity during this period, particularly driven by major airdrops in the Solana ecosystem, such as Jito and Pyth. “These airdrops created a billion dollar plus wealth effect in the ecosystem, driving SOL and other Solana ecosystem tokens higher, especially meme coins,” the report states.Franklin Templeton’s analysts point out that Solana has seen a significant increase in total fees and decentralized exchange volumes over the past year, indicating strong growth.“In the past year, Solana has seen significant growth demonstrated through an increase in both total fees and DEX volumes on the network,” the report mentions.The asset manager believes that Solana is uniquely qualified to capture the next wave of adoption in several sectors, including decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), payments (especially micropayments), compression NFTs (XNFTs), and centralized limit order books (CLOBs) with payment-for-order-flow. While Solana has experienced congestion issues due to high demand, the developer community is actively working on solutions. One major catalyst expected to address these issues is Firedancer, a Solana validator client developed by Jump Crypto. Franklin Templeton’s growing interest in Solana, as seen in their tweets earlier this year, stems from the firm’s attraction to Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko’s vision and the significant developments in Solana’s ecosystem during Q4 2023, including progress in decentralized prediction markets (DePIN), DeFi, meme coins, NFTs.

As Bitcoin Pumps, These Altcoins Are Doing Even Better - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe global crypto market cap stands at $2.29 trillion, marking a 3.50% increase over the last day, according to CoinMarketCap. Excluding stablecoins, 96% of the Top 100 tokens are registering gains, leaving only LEO, Gnosis, Axelar, and Celestia in bearish territory with less than 1.2% in losses.That closes out the week with at least one bullish day, as Bitcoin is also up over 4% in the last 24 hours and above $61,800 at time of writing, CoinGecko data shows.There are also 64 top coins that are posting better percentual gains than BTC: ORDI, TON, and BONK are among the top performers, each with impressive price movements in the last 24 hours.ORDI, a cryptocurrency that operates within the Ordinals protocol ecosystem based on blockchain technology, is the best-performing token in the top 100 in terms of price appreciation in the last day. ORDI went from $35.50 to $41.60, marking 17.55% growth in the last 24 hours. The coin is almost canceling out the losses of last week and is now down less than 2.5% in the last seven days.ORDI is going through an interesting pattern, even though it's a young coin. The short-term trend is bearish, with the EMA55 above of the EMA10. This is considered bearish because traders need to hold the coin for longer in order to be profitable. It also shows a strong ADX of 26 points.Today's spike is putting the price over the EMA 55, however, which could reduce the breach between the two EMAs and signal a possible bullish bounce over the next few days.In a bullish scenario, ORDI could test a new resistance near $53 for an additional 30% recovery. However, if the bearish trend remains, it could dip around 38% testing support at around $25.50.The second-best performing token in the Top 100 is Toncoin (TON), the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a project started by Telegram and then handed over to the open-source community after a legal tussle with the SEC. TON is up 9.76% in the last 24 hours, going from $5 to $5.52. TON also canceled out last week's losses, registering a weekly gain of 3.2%—9.2% over the last 30 days.In terms of fundamentals, there’s some hype around TON after an announcement by Pantera Capital, a crypto VC firm with over $5 billion in assets under management, of an investment in the TON blockchain. Pantera didn’t disclose the amount of money they put into the development of the TON network, but they didn’t mince words praising the blockchain and its potential.“We believe TON has the capacity to introduce crypto to the masses because it is used extensively within the Telegram network,” Pantera Capital said in its official announcement yesterday.TON seems a little stronger than ORDI, pointing to a stable bullish bounce. The price broke past the resistance of the EMA10, proving it's bullish at least in the short term. The RSI at 50 points shows a balance of forces, and the Squeeze Momentum Indicator is pointing toward an end to the bearish trend and the beginning of a bullish impulse. The coin is currently testing a weak resistance and the margin of operation is low.A bullish scenario puts TON into a zone near $6 for a 12% spike, with a bearish scenario sending the coin back to $4.90 for a price dip of 10.6%.Another coin with an interesting performance is BONK, a Solana-based meme coin that gained popularity in the latest crypto bull run. The coin is up 9.75% in the last 24 hours, going from $0.00002467 to $0.00002716. Like ORDI and TON, it wiped out last week's losses, rising 3.3% in the last 7 days and 16.9% in the last 30 days.Right now, BONK is trading sideways and has remained flat since mid-March. The coin has been bouncing between $0.00002950 and $0.00001940 with an atypical dip in mid-April. The ADX is weak due to the price behavior that is basically trading with no trend. However, the Squeeze Momentum Indicator points to a bullish impulse that may turn into a steady bullish trend.The bullish and bearish scenarios are marked by both support and resistance. An optimistic performance would take the coin to $0.00002950 for a 9% spike, and a pessimistic performance would dip the coin 25% to $0.00001940.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

This is Why XRP and Uniswap Networks Are Growing


XRP and Uniswap have demonstrated a considerable increase in the number of new addresses. 
This growth reflects heightened investor interest and expanding market activity.
XRP and Uniswap See Significant Increase
Ripple’s XRP has experienced a 7% increase in non-empty addresses in the past six months, rising to 5.2 million. According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, this uptick might reflect a broader acceptance of XRP as a mainstream financial asset, drawing new and seasoned investors into its ecosystem.
This growth is corroborated by the XRP Ledger, with a staggering 59.77 billion XRP held within these addresses. Interestingly, only a tiny fraction of these addresses, about 1,939, show zero balances.
On the other hand, Uniswap has also seen a staggering 140% increase in new addresses over the past year. It now stands at 7.26 million addresses, up from 3.03 million in May 2023.


“Uniswap wallets more than doubled in the past year! That’s a 140% increase from 3.03 million in May 2023 to 7.26 million in May 2024. This surge coincides with Uniswap surpassing a historic $2 trillion in cumulative trading volume in early April.” a crypto community leader said.

Uniswap leads in trading volume and holds the title for the most significant total value locked, with $5.31 billion. It is significantly outpacing its nearest competitor, PancakeSwap. However, this success comes amidst increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

CRV Teases Recovery Signs as It Closes Week With Green Tick - DailyCoin


        
The native token of Curve Finance is recording minimal gains following its weeks-long decline.



The gradual uptick has seen Curve DAO rebound from its record low value.



The slightly upward momentum of the broader crypto market is fueling recovery optimism.
The recently concluded week was rough for Curve DAO (CRV), the native token of the Curve ecosystem, which struggled to regain balance following a deep sink into an all-time low. Despite market fluctuations rippling through select assets with modest gains, CRV remained stagnant, unable to reverse its downward trajectory.However, in a surprising end to the week, the token may have its sights set on recovery.Curve Climbs 4% on Road to RecoveryAccording to CR V’s trading data on Friday, May 3, the token has fluttered between 3.7% to 4% uptick in the last 24 hours, valued at $0.435. The uptick marks a reversal of fortune for Curve DAO, correcting its week-long lows.  
While only minimal, Curve’s present upward momentum marks an approximate 30% increase from its record low value of $0.33, which it dipped to on April 12 in the wake of a crypto market crash. Source: CoinMarketCap However, the token still sits 36% below its year-opening value of $0.605, and a staggering 93% below its year-high value of over $0.8, dashing the once-heightened excitement for its potential to reclaim a $1 peg.The upward pressure in Curve DAO’s price is likely tied to the modest recovery witnessed in Bitcoin (BTC), which also had a rather challenging week. Currently trading over $61,600 BTC has recorded a total 4.4% uptick over the past day.
This marks a rebound from the token giant’s week-low range of $56,000 to $57,000, sparking recovery hopes across the broader market. Read this to discover the liquidation scare CRV’s all-time low crash triggered for its founder:Curve Founder Eases Contagion Fears, Slashing Debt to $42.7M This coin mixer is adopting preventive measures to avoid the DOJ’s scrutiny, find out more:Wasabi Wallet Exits Mixing Sector as DOJ Pressure Piles on

Bitcoin Bottom In? Retracement From $73,800 Is Deeper And Took Longer To Form


                            Some analysts were frightened by the recent drop in Bitcoin prices. Though the coin is showing signs of strength, multiple leveraged longs were liquidated early this week. 
In a post on X, one analyst thinks Bitcoin might have just found support, bottoming up after the contraction this week, pushing it lower from the multi-week range established in mid-March through to the better part of April.
 Bitcoin Retracement Is Deeper And Took Longer: Bottom In?
Expressing confidence, the analyst cited a historical pattern. Based on a price action assessment in the weekly chart, the analyst notes that whenever Bitcoin posts a deep retracement, there is usually a higher probability of the coin bottoming up and shaking off weakness. 

At the same time, prices tend to recover after a retracement that takes longer than expected.

Building on their historical pattern observation, the analyst applied it to the current BTC situation. The trader said up to the current level, the retracement from an all-time high is deeper and also took longer than usual, spanning several weeks. As a result, the analyst projected a high likelihood that Bitcoin prices might have found a bottom. 
While confidence abounds, it is still challenging to pick bottoms. Bitcoin and crypto assets are volatile, with prices moving quickly in either direction. At spot rates, Bitcoin is trading above $60,000, reversing losses of May 1. 
Even though this might cement the analyst’s position, BTC remains within a bear breakout formation, defined by the wide-ranging, high-volume bear bar of April 30.

Moreover, the coin is still boxed away from the April trade range, suggesting that weakness remains. Should there be a conclusive close above $62,000, the trend will likely shift in favor of bulls, reversing the losses of April 30. 

Before then, aggressive traders might be unloading at higher prices, aligning with the current bearish formation.
Market Forces Will Shape BTC Prices
Despite the bearish outlook, most analysts are bullish, expecting a sharp price recovery. One of them took to X, suggesting that buyers will likely take charge if prices recover from spot rates and return to the horizontal range of March to April.
BTC must move back to the range for uptrend continuation | Source: Peter Brandt on X
The pace and direction at which prices move going forward lean on market factors. So far, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers are decreasing their holdings. 
At the same time, the United States Federal Reserve is tracking inflation and other metrics as they tune monetary policy. If inflation drops, the USD will likely strengthen, heaping more pressure on the world’s most valuable crypto.

Bitcoin's price will hold these levels until August - Arthur Hayes - AMBCrypto



Arthur Hayes is predicting a slow upward trend for Bitcoin after hitting a local bottom
Bitcoin’s value will stabilize between $60,000 and $70,000 until August, he added

The last few weeks have been difficult for the crypto-market, with the same marked by a sharp decline in Bitcoin’s value. From a peak of $73,000 in March, Bitcoin has tumbled by over 19%, with a notable 7.8% drop in the past week alone. This steep decline has left investors and market watchers searching for signs of stability and potential recovery paths.
Exec weighs In: A turnaround on the horizon?
However, Arthur Hayes, the former Chief Executive of BitMEX, has shared a glimmer of hope amidst the market’s volatility. In his latest blog post, the exec suggested that Bitcoin has hit a local bottom, while also predicting gradual upward movement in the coming months. 
This perspective offers a contrast to the prevailing market sentiment, which has been largely bearish due to various economic pressures. These include Federal Reserve policy uncertainties and a general slowdown in cryptocurrency investments.
Hayes believes that the recent 12% retreat in Bitcoin’s price was necessary for market correction, attributing it to the U.S. tax season, which often prompts investors to liquidate holdings for tax liabilities. Additionally, he pointed to the “sell the news” effect that has been around since Bitcoin’s latest halving and a deceleration in the growth of assets under management in spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
Market mechanics: Liquidity and future projections
One of the more intriguing aspects of Hayes’s analysis is his discussion on the implications of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening (QT) strategy. He believes that the tapering of QT could lead to increased liquidity in the financial markets, potentially benefiting riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. 
In fact, he described this process as a form of “stealth money printing” that could bolster asset prices, leading to a sustained recovery phase. 
Moreover, Hayes is optimistic about the market’s capacity to absorb these changes and start a slow ascent. He envisages a scenario where the market will stabilize and then commence a gradual climb, mitigating the more drastic price movements seen recently. A far as his price prediction is concerned, Hayes noted, 
“A rally to above $60,000 and then range-bound price action between $60,000 and $70,000 until August.”
Here, it’s worth noting that over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has shown signs of a supposed “slow climb” on the charts. While it hiked to a 24-hour high of $59,966, BTC also recorded a trading volume that exceeded $30 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. 
Melker believes otherwise
Despite these positive projections, however, some analysts are more cautious. According to Scott Melker, for instance, because Bitcoin has broken past crucial support levels, now serving as resistance, this might trigger further price drops. In fact, he believes that a potential freefall to about $52,000 wouldn’t be out of the question.
Melker further claimed that the recent decline is relatively minor, marking only a 23% drop and well in line with previous corrections observed during this cycle. A more significant correction of 30% to 40% is likely during this market phase, he added.

Is Buying XRP A Profitable Trade? Crypto Analyst Says It’s “Dead” | Bitcoinist.com


								XRP has largely had a lackluster price movement in recent months, although it continues to show promise for real-world utility. Particularly, the price of XRP was recently rejected at $0.66 after a little surge which saw it falling back down as far as the $0.42 price level. The crypto now finds itself ranging between $0.6 and $0.4, which means it has failed to break over new price territories for the past two years. 
While some analysts see this trend as XRP still being undervalued, others are of a pessimistic outlook. Analyst Josh Olszewicz is part of the latter group of crypto analysts. In a recent analysis, Olszewicz noted the “dead” state of XRP while discussing the current state of altcoins. 
Current State Of XRP And The Crypto Market
XRP has failed to keep up with the gains of other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. While the total crypto market cap has climbed over 50% in the past year, XRP has lagged. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have broken into new all-time highs and others like Solana are on their way to creating new all-time highs.

XRP on the other hand, has failed to break above $1. This poor performance has led many critics to claim that interest in XRP is fading, especially as an investment asset.
The failure of XRP to break into new price levels was brought to the attention of crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz, who pointed out an interesting position regarding the cryptocurrency.  During his presentation on his technical analysis of altcoins, Olszewicz made the observation that XRP is not particularly ideal for investors who want to make a profit. He essentially referred to the cryptocurrency as “dead.”
“I just don’t know why anybody will bother trading this. It’s at the same price it was since 2018. It’s dead. It’s dead money,” the analyst said regarding XRP.
Is XRP Actually Dead?
Recent market dynamics have seen XRP falling in the market cap rankings. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.515 and is the 7th largest cryptocurrency. Some analysts argue that XRP is primed for significant growth. XRP bulls point to Ripple’s partnerships with major banks and payment providers as a sign of future success. 

Despite the lackluster price growth, XRP remains steady in terms of trading activity. Interestingly, Olszewicz noted that XRP will have days when traders can profit. However, holding while waiting for a longer-term bullish outlook doesn’t make sense to him. 
Crypto analyst EGRAG is of a different opinion. According to him, XRP could surge by over 700% and reach the $4 price level over a longer time frame.

Bitcoin Flashes Potentially Bullish Indicator Amid Crypto Market Downtick, According to Analytics Firm Santiment - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing a potentially bullish indicator amid an overall crypto market downtick, according to the digital asset analytics firm Santiment.
The firm notes in a new post on the social media platform X that the percentage of the BTC network’s available supply in profit is 84.4%.










Explains Santiment,
“This BTC ratio is at its lowest level in 2 months. Lower levels generally justify more bullish conditions.”
Source: Santiment/X
BTC is trading at $59,170 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 2.5% in the past 24 hours but down more than 8% in the past seven days.
A fellow analytics firm, CryptoQuant, looked into potential factors driving the downtick in the BTC market over the past week.
“Market sentiment towards Bitcoin is waning, evident from negative Coinbase premiums and lesser leverage in futures. This decrease in enthusiasm suggests a cautious approach from traders.
A slowdown in BTC demand from large investors (whales) is evident. The growth peaked at 12% monthly in late March, now down to 6%. Such deceleration affects potential price rallies, which rely on robust whale demand.”
Source: Santiment/X
CryptoQuant also notes that miners have been selling off BTC, adding to the market’s supply and “undermining potential price supports.” According to the analytics firm, increased short positions also indicate that traders have been betting on the top crypto asset dropping lower.

Here’s Why One Crypto Analyst Doesn’t Think an Ethereum ETF Will Get Approval Despite ‘Altcoin Bull Market’ - The Daily Hodl


								One widely followed crypto analyst is warning Ethereum (ETH) traders that an ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) is unlikely to happen soon.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 715,800 followers on the social media platform X that traders may have to wait a little longer for an ETH ETF.










“The Ethereum ETF is likely not going to be approved in May.
However, the markets are undervaluing a potential approval in August, as Ethereum is still getting sold off.
I think the chances of an approval in August is positive, through which I expect Ethereum to outperform.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
According to Van de Poppe, the current turbulence of the crypto markets presents an opportunity for crypto investors.
“You wanted to buy Bitcoin at <$60,000.
You wanted to buy Chainlink at <$15.
You wanted to buy any altcoin in a correction.
However, now, emotions kicked in and sentiment expects another drop, while the opportunity is here.
Maybe you don’t feel you want to, but this is the time.”
According to Van de Poppe, he favors trading newer altcoins over the “old” ones.
“Old coins continue to provide bad returns as Polygon (MATIC) is on a cycle low. 
It’s in the area of interest, but you should wonder whether it is going to generate a lot of returns or whether a new coin is going to yield higher upward returns.
To me: I stick to new coins.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
MATIC is currently down 20% in the last month.
The analyst concludes by noting the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) data is helping fuel today’s Bitcoin (BTC) rally and a wider altcoin bull run.
“Terrible economic data -> DXY (US dollar index) down, additionally the case for quarterly earnings and rate cuts will increase and therefore risk-on assets rally.
Bitcoin back to $61,600.
FOMC was the low for the markets and the altcoin bull market has started.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
BTC is worth $61,702 at time of writing, up 4% on the day.

Solana Game ‘Nyan Heroes’ Returning With Expanded Play-to-Airdrop Rewards - Decrypt

Following its initial pre-alpha demo playtest in late March and early April, Overwatch-esque hero shooter Nyan Heroes will bring its online servers back online next week amid a renewed play-to-airdrop push for the Epic Games Store PC title.Nyan Heroes is a team-based shooter with NFT assets and an upcoming token on the Solana blockchain. Its  servers will relaunch beginning May 8, and the second pre-alpha demo playtest period will include a new ranked mode for players.9 Lives Interactive Creative Director and CEO Max Fu told Decrypt that the playtest period is currently slated to last until May 26, though it’s possible that the studio will extend that window.Ahead of the pre-alpha revival, Nyan Heroes has launched the second season of its play-to-airdrop campaign, which will expand the kinds of rewards that players can accumulate—and will translate into an allocation for the game’s eventual NYAN token airdrop on Solana.Previously, players could earn in-game MEOW points for completing an array of rotating in-game quests, which included tasks like playing a certain number of matches, notching a particular number of enemy kills, and so on.In season two, the play-to-airdrop campaign will also add CATNIP points, which rewards for gameplay performance and add a multiplier to players’ airdrop allocations. CATNIP will exist alongside MEOW, and remain in the game during future seasons as well.Players were already able to earn CATNIP during the first season of gameplay, but the rewards functionality was not yet enabled. Those earned points will be carried over into the second season and they will factor into airdrop allocations.CATNIP can also be earned outside the game for social media engagement via Nyan Heroes’ play-to-airdrop dashboard.Nyan Heroes has racked up more than 200,000 downloads to date on the Epic Games Store, according to the studio, and hit a peak of more than 45,000 daily active users during the initial pre-alpha playtest window. The studio says that 20% of users were “Web2 players,” based on its data, suggesting mainstream crossover with the Epic Games Store’s traditional gamer base.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Snowden goes after Bitcoin devs, Elon, and puppy killers in X flurry

Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the United States National Security Agency accused of espionage after leaking classified information, had a busy day on the X social media app on May 2 when he seemed to have a modicum of vitriol for everyone from the current governor of South Dakota to the world’s richest person. Snowden, an outspoken whistleblower who lived in asylum in Russia until 2022, when he was granted full citizenship in the country, has risen to media prominence in the wake of his whistleblower incident. Currently, he holds celebrity status, especially among some technology-based communities and is well known for speaking out on topics he considers related to freedom and privacy. Elon MuskAnother celebrity technologist who’s known for speaking out on issues related to freedom, Elon Musk, was among those who drew the ire of Snowden during his May 2nd tirade. After Musk posted a poll asking whether someone who “tears down the American flag and puts up another flag in its place” should be deported to the country whose flag they raised, Snowden chastised the billionaire with a lesson on freedom of expression. Source: @ElonMusk on X. “First of all,” Snowden began in a post on Musk’s X social media platform, “Americans' freedom of expression, which includes all manner of flag-trampling and other unlikable acts, is constitutionally-protected for a very good reason.” He then asked what would happen if someone replaced the U.S. flag with a flag bearing the McDonald’s logo.In an additional post, Snowden continued:Source: @Snowden on X“Because no law—even one described, like the Constitution, as the "supreme law of the land"—possesses a force of its own; the ink cannot leap from the page to fight for your rights. A law can only defend the people when the people defend the law. Its power derives from our own.”To the best of our knowledge, Musk hasn’t responded. Related: Musk to charge new X users to post, but some say it won’t stop the botsBitcoinOn the subject of Bitcoin, Snowden posted what he called his final warning: Source: @Snowden on X. “I've been warning Bitcoin developers for ten years that privacy needs to be provided for at the protocol level,” he wrote, before adding “This is the final warning. The clock is ticking.”The warning was evidently prompted by news that Wasabi Wallet developer zkSNACKs was shutting down. It’s unclear exactly what Snowden was warning against, but the whistleblower has long been associated with cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin, as a proponent and advocate. Kristi NoemAfter opining on the state of free speech on X and Bitcoin’s future, Snowden turned his barbed commentary on South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem. The embattled republican recently became the target of massive social and traditional media backlash after excerpts from an upcoming book she authored were found to contain the story of her shooting a 14-month-old puppy in the head. Noem has since gone on to defend her actions as allowable under the law and, in subsequent commentary, even gone so far as to say the puppy was untrainable and dangerous. It was these comments, apparently, that set Snowden off and caused him to draw a comparison between excessive force in the field of law enforcement and Noem’s farm animal policies. Source: @Snowden on X. Snowden’s post referred to Noem as a “puppy-killer” adding “OK lady, sure. Soon the police union will tell us that the pup was coming right for her; sudden movement, feared for her life.”

Good Bad News for Crypto | Bankless


Back already? Risk assets pumped this morning following weaker-than-expected employment with Bitcoin up nearly 5%, a surge directly attributable to the increased probability of steeper and sooner interest rate cuts. Why is bad news good for your bags?The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics released employment data for the month of April at 8:30 AM EST this morning (the moment this morning’s BTC rally was incited), showing that non-farm payrolls increased by 175k as the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9%.Non-farm payrolls came in below the consensus expectations for 243k jobs, the series’s worst month since October 2023, and the unemployment rate is now back at 2024 highs despite ticking down slightly after March’s massive employment beat.On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell specifically stated that a weakening labor market could spur the interest rate cuts market participants have eagerly awaited; today’s weakening employment data created massive increases in the odds for a cut.Yields on US Treasuries, which have plummeted throughout the month of May, continued on their trajectory lower as the imminence of rate cuts received further confirmation meanwhile market participants are now pricing in a base case of two interest cuts in 2024.
Policymakers, prolific financial thinkers, and the media apparatus have buttered you up to believe that an economy in decline is somehow a bullish catalyst because it will incite rate cuts, however, this is far from the truth. History demonstrates time-and-time again that rate cuts typically coincide with the deepest points of recession, demonstrating that interest rate manipulation is only one of numerous variables that impact the economy.Fundamentally, bond yields are a reflection of future growth and inflation expectations. Their move lower suggests that there will be no reinflation and that growth is headed lower.Interest rates below the “neutral rate” at which we achieve stable employment and inflation can service an economic boon, but this neutral rate falls sharply into recessions, meaning that rate cuts alone may be inadequate to offset economic decline.The Fed claims to be entirely “data dependent,” but this leaves them focused on lagging data metrics and staring in the rearview mirror; by the time they run over the pedestrian ahead, it will be too late.While near-zero interest rates are certainly nice for capitalized borrowers, they are meaningless when the availability of credit is slim and the quality of borrowers is declining alongside the value of their assets.

Price analysis 5/3: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, DOGE, TON, ADA, AVAX, SHIB

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are trying to stage a comeback by pushing the price above the psychologically crucial level of $60,000. Veteran trader Peter Brandt said in a X post that if Bitcoin holds the most recent lows and moves higher, it will be considered a “very common bull market continuation chart construction.”Analysts are bullish on the long-term prospects of Bitcoin but do not expect the uptrend to start in a hurry. Bitfinex Alpha market report said that Bitcoin could stay range-bound for one to two months “with swings of $10,000 on either side.”Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Traders are likely to keep a close watch on the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. According to Farside Investors data, the Bitcoin ETFs witnessed outflows of $563 million on May 1. The sentiment is likely to pick up after the Bitcoin ETFs witness net inflows for a few successive days. Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes believes the sell-off has ended, and the crypto markets may head higher.What important resistance levels may act as a roadblock for the recovery? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin is taking support in the zone between the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $58,017 and the 61.8% retracement level of $54,298.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bulls pushed the price back above the breakdown level of $59,600 on May 3, indicating that the recent fall may have been a bear trap. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to stall the relief rally at the 20-day exponential moving average ($63,366) and then at the 50-day simple moving average ($66,151).If the price turns down from the moving averages, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then make one more attempt to sink the BTC/USDT pair below $56,500. If they succeed, the pair may slump to $54,298.Conversely, a break above the 50-day SMA will suggest that the pair may extend its stay inside the range for some more time.Ether price analysisEther (ETH) fell below the $2,850 support on May 1, but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid demand at lower levels.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 45 show that the bears have a slight edge. If the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA ($3,152), the bears will try to yank the ETH/USDT pair to the support line of the descending channel pattern.Contrarily, if the price rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the selling pressure could be reducing. The bulls will have thrust the pair above the resistance line to indicate the end of the downtrend.BNB price analysisBNB (BNB) has been oscillating inside the large range between $495 and $635 for the past several days, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf the price sustains below the moving averages, the BNB/USDT pair could slide to the strong support at $495. Buyers are likely to buy this level and keep the range intact. However, if the bears prevail, the pair could start a downtrend to $460 and thereafter to $400.Instead, if the price rises above the moving averages, the pair could climb to the overhead resistance of $635. This is a significant resistance for the bears to defend because a break above it could catapult the pair to $692.Solana price analysisThe bears pulled Solana (SOL) below the $126 support but could not maintain the lower levels, indicating buying by the bulls. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe SOL/USDT pair has reached the 20-day EMA ($145), an important level to watch out for. If buyers overcome this barrier, the pair may climb toward the overhead resistance of $162. This level may attract selling by the bears.The crucial support to watch on the downside is $126. If the price turns lower from the 20-day EMA and breaks below $126, it will signal the start of the next leg of the down move. The pair may then slump to $100.XRP price analysisXRP’s (XRP) relief rally has reached the 20-day EMA ($0.53), an essential level for the bears to defend if they want to maintain control. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the sellers will again attempt to tug the XRP/USDT pair to the strong support zone between $0.46 and $0.41. Buyers are expected to aggressively protect this zone.The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA. If this hurdle is cleared, the pair could reach $0.57, which may again pose a strong challenge. A break above this resistance could open the doors for a potential rise to $0.62.Dogecoin price analysisDogecoin (DOGE) bounced off the $0.12 support on May 1, indicating that the bulls are trying to defend the level.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewBuyers will try to push the price to the overhead zone between the 20-day EMA ($0.15) and the downtrend line. Sellers are expected to protect this zone with vigor. If the price turns down from this zone, the bears will again attempt to sink the DOGE/USDT pair below the neckline near $0.12. If they do that, the pair will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. That may start a down move to $0.10 and eventually to $0.08.This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the bulls propel the price above the downtrend line.Toncoin price analysisToncoin (TON) is finding support in the zone between the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $4.90 and the 61.8% retracement level of $4.25.TON/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe relief rally has reached the moving averages, which is an important level to watch out for. If the price turns down from the moving averages, the bears will again attempt to sink the TON/USDT pair below $4.25.On the other hand, if buyers overcome the obstacle at the 20-day EMA ($5.53), it will suggest the start of a more robust recovery. The pair may then rise to $6.35, where the bears may mount a strong resistance.Related: Bitcoin and Ether options worth $2.4B set to expire May 3, max BTC pain at $61KCardano price analysisThe bulls are trying to maintain Cardano (ADA) above the breakdown level of $0.46, but the bears are likely to put up an intense fight.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe zone between $0.46 and the 20-day EMA ($0.48) is likely to witness solid selling by the bears. If the price turns down sharply from this zone and breaks below $0.40, the ADA/USDT pair may start the next leg of the downtrend to $0.35.Contrary to this assumption, if buyers shove the price above the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair may then ascend to $0.52 and later to $0.57, which may act as a strong hurdle.Avalanche price analysisAvalanche’s (AVAX) price action of the past few days has formed a range of $29 on the downside and $40 on the upside. AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe downsloping 20-day EMA ($36.56) and the RSI near 42 suggest that the bears have the upper hand. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will make another attempt to sink the AVAX/USDT pair below $29. If they manage to do that, the next leg of the down move to $27.24 may begin.On the contrary, if buyers kick the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest buying at lower levels. The pair may then climb to $40. A break and close above this level will indicate that the bulls are attempting a comeback.Shiba Inu price analysisThe long tail on Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) May 1 candlestick shows that the bulls are trying to defend the $0.000020 level.SHIB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe recovery attempt is likely to face selling at the moving averages. If the price turns down sharply from the moving averages, it will increase the likelihood of a drop below $0.000020. If that happens, the SHIB/USDT pair may plunge to $0.000018.If buyers want to prevent the decline, they will have to drive and maintain the price above the moving averages. If they do that, it will indicate that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair may rise to $0.000028 and subsequently to $0.000033.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Dutch authorities arrest suspect in ZKasino gambling scam, seize $12.2 million in assets

The Netherlands’ Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) announced the arrest of a 26-year-old suspected to be involved in the ZKasino decentralized gambling platform scam.Meanwhile, speculations within the crypto community suggest that the arrested person could potentially be the pseudonymous founder of the platform known as Derivatives Monke.Asset seizuresIn the wake of the arrest, Dutch authorities revealed the seizure of assets, including digital assets, real estate, and luxury vehicles, worth around 11.4 million euros ($12.2 million).Meanwhile, this arrest signals a pivotal development in the ZKasino fraud case, in which investors suffered losses exceeding $33 million in Ethereum. The platform initially pledged a 30-day investment return guarantee but later diverted users’ ETH to the Ethereum-based liquid staking protocol Lido.According to Dutch authorities, the platform’s smart contract configuration strongly indicated that it did not intend to refund the funds.FIOD added:“During the investigation the FIOD worked closely with staff from the Financial Crime Compliance and Investigations Team of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which helped secure millions of euros in cryptocurrencies.”Simultaneously, Dutch authorities assured the stolen funds would be restituted to the victims. However, they underscored the importance of victim cooperation and encouraged the sharing of any pertinent information to aid ongoing investigations.Community celebratesMembers of the crypto community on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) have expressed satisfaction with news of the arrest, viewing it as a significant stride towards recovering their funds and attaining justice.Concurrently, the perusal of a chat group established by ZKasino victims showed a collective willingness to collaborate with law enforcement agencies. Notably, they are already anticipating that the authorities would secure the arrest of other culprits.A user identified as Pursuit of Profit on Telegram said.“The Dutch intelligence service are monsters! The best out there, now that they got him in custody and seized his electronic devices, they will locate every one of them involved in the scam based on digital footprints from communications etc. Just wait for it.”Latest Netherlands Stories

Coin mixer Wasabi Wallet will discontinue its conjoin coordination service.



The move comes amid intensifying enforcement actions from US authorities.



The Wasabi wallet conjoin feature suspension will impact other wallet service providers.
From Tornado Cash to Samourai Wallet, privacy-focused crypto mixers have dominated industry headlines in recent months, drawing attention to intense regulatory drama and market exits. On April 29, 2024, zkSNACKs-owned Wasabi Wallet was added to the list, announcing its exit from the United States, completely restricting user access to its services within the jurisdiction. Less than a week after the key decision, the firm announced the discontinuation of its coin mixing service, prompting questions about the reason behind its recent flurry of actions.Wasabi Wallet Axes Conjoin Feature: Fear of the DOJ?Revealed in a blog post on May 2, 2024, Wasabi Wallet’s decision comes amidst intensified enforcement actions from the Department of Justice, as the company seeks to evade potential scrutiny of its offerings by United States authorities.
According to the firm, the conjoin coordination suspension, which will take effect on June 1, 2024, aligns with its efforts to operate “under legal clarity,” echoing the concerns stated for its US market exit.“This decision was made after careful consideration and with a heavy heart. Throughout our history, we have always made efforts to operate under legal clarity. At this point, we need to regain more certainty before moving forward,” stated the blog post. While it will no longer offer complete privacy, the wallet emphasized that it will continue to function as a Bitcoin wallet and maintain other privacy features, such as its client-side filtering architecture, Tor integration, and custom coin selection.Wasabi Wallet’s decision follows a series of preventive measures undertaken by other coin-mixing service providers amid increased efforts to avoid the DoJ’s line of fire.DoJ Cracks on Crypto MixersIn August 2023, authorities initiated legal proceedings against popular crypto mixer Tornado Cash, alleging its frequent adoption by hackers to conceal traces of their illicitly acquired funds.
The DoJ accused the firm of facilitating nearly $1 billion in illegal transactions for sanctioned organizations such as the North Korean-linked hacker group Lazarus, charging its principal co-founders, Roman Storm, and Roman Semenov, for aiding cybercrime and violating regulations.Nearly a year later, authorities turned their attention to the Bitcoin mixer Samourai Wallet for similar charges. Alleging the facilitation of $2.1 billion in illegal transactions. On April 24, 2024, the Justice Department arrested Samourai founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill, indicting them on charges of money laundering and sanctions violations.The two Samourai Wallet founders, Keonne Rodriguez and William Longman Hill have also been arrested by the DOJ, facing a 25-year sentence each if convicted.On the Flipside
Crypto mixers have been labeled as aiding terror financing, and the recent rise in geopolitical tensions, such as the Israel-Iran conflict, could be a contributing factor to the heightened crackdown on crypto mixers.



Following Wasabi Wallet’s announcement, hardware wallet provider Trezor, which utilized the coinjoin feature, also declared the discontinuation of its service.



The arrested Samourai Wallet co-founder, Keonne Rodriguez has recently pleaded not guilty to the DoJ’s charges.
Why This MattersWasabi Wallet’s suspension of the coinjoin coin mixing feature highlights its compliance and efforts to avoid potential legal repercussions from the Department of Justice (DoJ). However, even with the preventive measures, the firm may still be subject to enforcement if linked to previous illicit activities.Discover the FBI’s cautions to investors as crypto mixer crackdown continues:FBI Warns Americans as Crypto Enforcement Actions Intensify Indian authorities and Binance have recently busted a fraudulent crypto scheme, read more:Binance Collaborates With Indian Authorities to Nab $10M Scam

Bitcoin Needs To Cross New 'Line In The Sand' To Confirm It Was A 'Fake Dip': 10x Research - Benzinga

Crypto research firm 10x Research on Thursday highlighted a crucial chart that Bitcoin BTC/USD traders should be monitoring closely.What Happened: In its latest newsletter titled “Fake Dip?” 10x Research pointed out that Bitcoin’s relative strength has retraced back to 40%, which has been associated with rally attempts on three occasions since early 2023. The firm also identified a new “line in the sand” at $62,000, where they might change their view if Bitcoin fails to break above this level quickly.The newsletter mentioned four instances where Bitcoin broke below a triangle support level but quickly reversed due to various bullish news or events:
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s proposal for uncapped deposit insurance.



Blackrock’s filing for a Bitcoin ETF.



Franklin Templeton joining the Bitcoin ETF race.



A drop in U.S. Core PCE below 3.0%.
Read Also: ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Robert Kiyosaki Unveils His Bitcoin Strategy Amid Market Crash: ‘The Best Time To Get Rich'Why It Matters: The current triangle breakdown appears more severe than the previous four instances, and the distribution pattern resembles a top rather than a sideways move. 10x Research’s trend model is currently in a downtrend, similar to January 2024, while it was in a bull trend during the other three dips.The research firm emphasizes that the longer Bitcoin stays below the $62,000 level, the more difficult it will become to break above it again. While their three reversal indicators remain bearish, they are open to the possibility of buying this dip if Bitcoin falls deep enough or rallies, although this is not their base case scenario.The research firm had previously cautioned that prices might fall another 20% and drop into the low $50,000s.What’s Next: These topics are expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Now Read: Why Bitcoin Spiked Above $62,000 Following The April Jobs ReportThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Major Fraud Case: Victim Sends $71 Million in Bitcoin to Fraudster's Wallet with His Own Hands - Bitcoin Sistemi


A wallet lost 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), worth over $71 million, due to a sophisticated phishing attack known as 'address poisoning'.
The incident occurred approximately six hours ago when the victim created a new address as “0xd9A1b0B1e1aE382DbDc898Ea68012FfcB2853a91” and transferred 0.05 Ether (ETH) to this new address. In a cunning move, the fraudster created an address with the same initials and ending letters and transferred 0 ETH to the victim, causing the transfer to appear in the transaction history.


Many wallets hide the middle part of the address with “…” for a cleaner user interface. When the victim wanted to transfer his WBTC to his new address, he accidentally copied the scammer's address with the same starting and ending letters. As a result, they transferred 1,155 WBTC worth $71 million directly to the fraudster.

Address poisoning is a type of attack where the hacker creates a wallet address similar to the victim's through spoofed address services or address mining and spams the victim with a large number of transactions. If the victim accidentally copies the hacker's fake address, they will accidentally transfer their funds to the hacker instead of their own wallet.





Changpeng Zhao, former CEO of Binance, explained that such attacks can be deceptively effective. “Scammers are now so good at generating addresses with the same starting and ending letters that most people only check this when transferring cryptocurrency,” Zhao wrote in a social media post following a similar security incident in August 2023.

LayerZero demands sybil airdrop farmers to self-report - Crypto Briefing




LayerZero, a protocol enabling connections between incompatible blockchains, has given sybil airdrop farmers an opportunity to self-report their addresses by May 17 in exchange for a reduced token allocation.According to LayerZero, those who decide to come forward will receive 15% of their intended allocation, while those who do not are at risk of receiving “nothing” from the planned token airdrop.Sybil airdrop farming refers to an ostensibly deceptive practice where individuals engage in Sybil attacks by creating multiple fake identities or accounts to exploit airdrop programs.A Sybil attack is enacted when an individual creates numerous false accounts to gain an unfair advantage, such as receiving more airdrop tokens than legitimately entitled. This behavior has been deemed unethical for undermining the perceived fairness and security of airdrop programs, although many in the space still use it as a method. A blog post from LayerZero details how the project plans to address the issue and implement sybil filtering methods used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity are implemented. Notably, some of the filtering parameters include minting valueless NFTs and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity.Sybil activity, where users adopt tactics such as creating multiple addresses to increase their share of an airdrop, is a significant issue for crypto projects. This is particularly true when an airdrop is anticipated, as user activity often declines once the token distribution occurs, with mercenary farmers moving their funds to projects that have yet to distribute tokens.“We are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,” LayerZero stated in the X postLayerZero itself has experienced a decline in user activity since announcing its airdrop snapshot. According to data from the protocol’s onchain explorer, daily cross-chain transactions fell from around 300,000 on April 30, the day before the airdrop announcement, to about 150,000 currently, representing a drop of more than 50%.To counter the mass exit of users post-airdrop, some crypto projects have begun adopting a process of distributing tokens in multiple rounds.Protocols such as decentralized exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen this approach. On this end, speculation has arisen that LayerZero may follow suit, as the team stated that the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop, suggesting the possibility of future snapshots.

Crypto Expert Turns Bullish On Bitcoin, Predicts Quantitative Easing Will Begin Soon


                            Crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe has made a bullish case for Bitcoin as he alluded to macroeconomic factors that could soon play out in the flagship crypto’s favor. In line with this, he urged Bitcoin investors to take action with a parabolic surge on the horizon. 
An Imminent Quantitative Easing Would Be Good For Bitcoin
Van de Poppe suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin will rise on the back of a Quantitative Easing (QE), which he anticipates is “close.” He noted that the Fed has already started to “unwind Treasury buybacks and is reducing QT [Quantitative Tightening].” He claims this is happening because the economic data has worsened, which puts the US at risk of a recession. 

Therefore, the Fed seeks to avoid this recession by buying back long-term government bonds and injecting liquidity into the financial system. As the crypto expert predicts, this could be good since it will force the Fed to take a more dovish stance and possibly lower interest rates, boosting investors’ confidence to go all in on risk assets like Bitcoin. 
Van de Popper further predicts that this Quantitative Easing will become evident in the data released in the coming months. In line with this, he advised investors to long Bitcoin. It is worth noting that Bitcoin dropped to as low as $57,000 ahead of the latest FOMC meeting, with many investors seeming to have anticipated a hawkish stance from the Fed. 
However, as the crypto expert noted, the rates remain unchanged, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised the possibility of a rate cut as early as June. Given Bitcoin’s price recovery since then, this development looks to have already revived a bullish sentiment among investors. 
What To Expect Going Forward
In another X post, Van de Popper revealed his expectations for the crypto market going forward. He stated that Bitcoin will consolidate and go sideways (possibly ahead of the QE which will boost its price in the coming months. Meanwhile, he also expects Altcoins to “heavily outperform and rotation kicks in.”

The crypto expert had previously echoed a similar sentiment when he stated that he expects altcoins to bounce in their Bitcoin pairs while Bitcoin faces a period of consolidation that he doesn’t expect to change in the “coming months.” 
Back then, he also mentioned that there would be a narrative shift to Ethereum, and he reaffirmed this belief in a more recent X post, stating that he expects a lot from the second-largest crypto token by market cap.  
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $59,100, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Crypto Biz: The Bitcoin summer, Avalanche integrates with Stripe, and more

While developers have long focused on the Ethereum network, the Bitcoin ecosystem is making a comeback, with several initiatives now aiming to innovate on the original blockchain.Recent developments include the growing ties between Bitcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi), driving the demand for layer-2 protocols to unclog the Bitcoin blockchain and reduce transaction fees as on-chain activity soars.Major players like Coinbase are also reviewing Bitcoin offerings. The crypto exchange finally added the Lightning Network as an alternative for users seeking to transfer Bitcoin (BTC), following Binance’s similar move nearly a year ago. Meanwhile, software firm Animoca Brands has partnered with the Opal Foundation — a new Bitcoin ecosystem protocol — to enter the Bitcoin industry.The introduction of Runes on the Bitcoin blockchain has ignited further buzz. The new token standard was launched on April 20, allowing fungible tokens to be created on the network. Rune transactions have added over 1,200 BTC worth of transaction fees to miners in less than 10 days.This week’s Crypto Biz features the Lightning Network rollout on Coinbase, Avalanche integrating with Stripe, MicroStrategy earning results and a tokenized fund from BlackRock. Avalanche integrates with Stripe for fiat-to-crypto onboardingThe Avalanche C-Chain network has integrated with payment firm Stripe, allowing verified Stripe users to buy Avalanche’s (AVAX) token and send it to their wallets, according to the network’s developer, Ava Labs. Eight Avalanche Web3 apps have also been integrated with the platform. According to the post, Avalanche app developers can now embed a customizable widget into their interfaces, allowing users to convert fiat to crypto via Stripe’s platform. The integration attempts to solve the “cold start problem” in Web3, the post stated, which occurs when “customers don’t have enough funds in their wallets to carry out transactions on the platform.” To solve this issue, Stripe will handle “all the KYC, payments, fraud, and compliance,” allowing the developer to focus on the app itself.Source: AvalancheMicroStrategy Q1 net loss hits $53.1 million, but Bitcoin buying spree continuesMicroStrategy reported a net loss of $53.1 million in the first quarter of 2024, largely due to a $191.6 million impairment loss on digital assets, which was significantly higher than the previous year. The firm’s revenue also decreased by 5.5% to $115.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. Under traditional accounting methods, their Bitcoin holdings were valued at $5.07 billion but would have been marked at $15.2 billion if valued at fair market price, reflecting a 65% increase in Bitcoin’s value during the quarter. The company continued to acquire more Bitcoin in April, and it now holds 214,400 BTC worth $13.5 billion, bought at an average purchase price of $35,180.BlackRock’s BUIDL becomes the world’s largest tokenized treasury fundThe BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) has become the largest treasury fund tokenized on the blockchain, overtaking Franklin Templeton’s similar fund. With a market cap of $375 million, BlackRock’s recently launched BUIDL fund has exceeded the $368 million market cap of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (BENJI), which has been around for a year, according to data from Dune Analytics. Last week, BUIDL attracted $70 million, including a significant investment from Ondo Finance. During the same period, BENJI saw a 3.7% decrease in its assets under management. Across various blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon and Solana, over $1.2 billion in U.S. Treasurys is now tokenized.Coinbase integrates Lightning Network for Bitcoin transactionsCoinbase now supports the Bitcoin Lightning Network, offering users the option of transferring Bitcoin using Lightning or the Bitcoin network. Using the Lightning Network, Coinbase customers can transfer Bitcoin more quickly and cheaply than transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. Transfers on Lightning are “instant,” in contrast to transfers on the Bitcoin network, which may take 10 minutes to two hours because of the limited number of transactions per second the Bitcoin network processes. To use the Lightning Network, the intended recipient sends an invoice consisting of a lengthy string of characters that Coinbase will recognize as the amount of the transfer. In some cases, Lightning transfers may take several hours or fail because of a unique implementation or fee structure, Coinbase warned on April 30.Crypto Biz is your weekly pulse on the business behind blockchain and crypto, delivered directly to your inbox every Thursday.

Your Free Tokens Are Not Available | Bankless


EigenLayer’s token drop was announced on Monday, but plenty of users across the globe were disgruntled that the claim page for EIGEN is "Not Available" to them!Who can't claim?Not only are residents from a expansive list of nations including the U.S. banned from claiming EIGEN, the claims site explicitly blocks users from interacting with the frontend via VPN or other proxy technologies! The extensive list of countries excluded from the EIGEN drop.This restriction came as a shock to some existing users due to unfettered access to the EigenLayer frontend otherwise, and limited communication from the protocol on their plans for aggressive geo-blocking.While EigenLayer is far from the first protocol to pursue some of these limitations in their token distribution, the outsized EIGEN opportunity is leading users in impacted geographies to wonder whether they will continue to be excluded from future gains until regulators get their act together.The New Normal for Airdrops?Considering the hostile and unclear regulatory backdrop crypto protocols are forced to operate under, disappointments like the EIGEN claim restrictions are becoming more and more common.Amid a lack of clear guidance from existing statutes and the refusal of American financial system regulators to provide satisfactory guidelines for digital assets, protocol operators and token issuers are left guessing how to best avoid the scrutiny of agencies such as the SEC.This lack of regulatory clarity has infested every corner of the crypto industry, making it exceedingly difficult for users to access crypto protocols and often prohibiting users from accessing the free money which their onchain interactions entitled them to claim.
Because the presence of token distributions to American (and sanctioned) users can easily place crypto protocols within the jurisdiction of various American regulators, projects frequently block IP addresses originating from America and nations sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).While teams had historically sought to mitigate potential liability by simply banning IP addresses from restricted nations, a September 2023 settlement made between the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and DeFi derivatives platform Opyn indicates that regulators believed their blocking of IPs was insufficient at prohibiting restricted users from accessing the platform, placing it within the jurisdiction of U.S. regulators.
This approach is not unique to EigenLayer and has been adopted for numerous airdrop distributions, such as Celestia’s TIA, and implemented by certain bluechip protocols to prevent unauthorized access to their frontends, including MakerDAO’s Spark lending protocol.To minimize the potential for American regulators to target their projects while still preserving access to their decentralized protocol and maintaining the ability to launch tokens, many projects have now resorted to completely banning VPNs, eliminating any possibility that users from restricted nations can access their products.Thankfully, there are still avenues for restricted users to access these protocols, either via directly interacting with smart contracts onchain or physically changing their location, but unfortunately, it appears highly likely that the stringent combination of geoblocking and VPN restriction will be the norm for the majority of token issuers going forward.Airdrop hunters would be keen to anticipate and prepare for geographical token claim restrictions whenever engaging with early stage projects, regardless of whether they can interact with the underlying protocol via its frontend.

MakerDAO unveils two new tokens in a major overhaul - CoinJournal



                    

                    
The two new tokens teased by MakerDAO are NewStable (NST) and NewGovToken (NGT).
NST replaces Dai and offers upgraded features while NGT replaced MKR and empowers broader governance participation.
Existing Dai and MKR holders will have the choice to transition to the new tokens or continue using their current assets.

MakerDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization that oversees the Maker Protocol, has announced the introduction of two new tokens – NewStable (NST) and NewGovToken (NGT).
These tokens mark a significant milestone in MakerDAO’s evolution, offering enhanced stability and governance features within its ecosystem.
NewStable (NST) token
The NewStable (NST) token represents an upgraded version of Dai, designed to promote broader adoption and provide advanced stability features.
Existing Dai holders will have the option to seamlessly upgrade to NST while retaining the flexibility to convert their holdings back to Dai at any time.
Additionally, NST holders will be able to participate in farming activities to earn NewGovToken (NGT) from the moment of launch.
NewGovToken (NGT) token
The NewGovToken (NGT) token serves as the new governance token within the MakerDAO ecosystem, offering Maker (MKR) holders the opportunity to upgrade their tokens.
Each MKR token will convert to 24,000 NGT during the upgrade process, strategically redenominated to encourage broader engagement in governance activities. This initiative aims to enable more users to hold a significant number of NGT, empowering them to actively influence the future direction of the MakerDAO ecosystem.
MakerDAO expanding its offerings while maintaining flexibility
With the introduction of NST and NGT, MakerDAO is expanding its offerings while maintaining flexibility for users.
The upcoming brand reveal will mark the official introduction of these tokens into the ecosystem, providing users with access to new features and opportunities.
In addition to the token launch, MakerDAO is also exploring investment opportunities to further strengthen its ecosystem. Plans include a substantial investment of $600 million in DAI into USDe and staked USDe (sUSDe) through Morpho Labs’ DeFi lending protocol. These investments aim to support the development and growth of stablecoin assets within the DeFi space.

Most Dogecoin Holders Didn't Buy the Elon Musk Top - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsElon Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency is far, far away from an all-time high price of $0.73 set in 2021. But for a majority of Dogecoin holders, there’s little reason to tuck their tail in between their legs.Some 77% of Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are in the money—meaning the cryptocurrency’s price is above what it was relative to when people bought it—according to IntoTheBlock. With 21% of Dogecoin holders posting paper losses, that leaves a 2% sliver of holders at breakeven.The original meme coin with a market capitalization of $20 billion was created in 2013 as a joke, but it has a semi-serious place in the Tesla CEO’s heart. Based on a popular meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, a cadre of canine-themed coins have steadily spawned in Dogecoin’s wake.Though Musk’s Dogecoin posts have largely petered off, his cheerleading on Twitter spurred Dogecoin’s ascent in 2021. DOGE set its peak price of $0.73 early on May 8, 2021—just hours before Musk was set to appear on "Saturday Night Live." Meme coin investors prayed that his prominent hosting role would propel DOGE, perhaps even to the fabled $1.00 mark.Instead, the opposite happened. The token buckled over 20% in roughly an hour as Elon and his mom poked fun at Dogecoin, and he joked that it was "a hustle" during the show's "Weekend Update" segment. It's never recovered since.Though some believe meme coins are undermining the long-term vision of crypto, meme coin mania can lead some traders to outsized returns. For others, risky bets can sour quickly as the crypto market oscillates with hallmark volatility.The price of Dogecoin had risen 5% over the past day to $0.14, as of this writing, according to CoinGecko. Still, the cryptocurrency’s price has fallen 21% over the past 30 days—notably off from multi-year highs of $0.22 in March.When it comes to the extent of holders’ paper gains, however, it appears Dogecoin isn’t top dog relative to other meme coins boasting a furry, four-legged mascot. That title currently belongs to the Ethereum-based meme coin Floki, with 83% of holders situated in the money.Toward the tail end of the pack, 60% of Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders have profits on paper. (IntoTheBlock doesn’t report data on the Solana-based DogWifHat or Bonk.) Meanwhile, 75% of holders for the meme coin Pepe are in the green.Drawing on everything from pop culture to internet memes—and even celebrity deaths—meme coins are distinct as a subgroup of digital assets that often offer little to no utility. Instead, they move mostly on vibes. Sometimes, though, they disappear entirely.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

SHIB Shibarium Boosts Speed with Augmented Hard Fork Changes - DailyCoin


        
Shibarium devs enhance Layer-2’s infrastructure with a double hard fork.



Shiba Inu (SHIB) soared above $0.000023 as the first installment went live.



SHIB Army members enquired about the long-awaited auto-burning portal.
Developers at Shiba Inu (SHIB) have announced a smooth transition to the new version of Shibarium Layer-2. As planned, Shibarium’s blockchain underwent a hard fork on May 2, 2024, at the block height of 4504576. This was confirmed by Shibarium Network’s official X handle on Thursday evening.Met with greetings and encouragement from the Shiba Inu community, this hard fork on Shibarium is slated to bring a couple of key improvements as Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain is soon to turn one year old. Directed at enhancing user experience, one of the key changes is going to be predictable gas fees and a substantially faster transaction speed.Bi-Folded Shibarium Hard Fork ExplainedA second part of this hard fork is set to occur at block height 3941864. The already implemented upgrade is referred to as Bor and is centered around state sync confirmation, which significantly accelerates performance.
The latter part of Shibarium’s hard fork is called the Heimdall, which is supposed to bring “deterministic finality” to Shibarium’s blockchain. In other words, Heimdall brings a stable and more reliable gas fee distribution on-chain, meaning that crypto enthusiasts who are using Shibarium in ultra-high traffic times won’t pay disproportionate gas fees.Aside from fixing the fluctuating gas fee issues during times of heavy demand, Shiba Inu’s developers have also fixed the bugs in relation to its non-fungible token (NFT) mechanism.On the Flipside

Bitfinex whales bolster Bitcoin holdings by 6% amid recent price surge | CryptoSlate

Quick TakeOver the past few days, Bitfinex has recorded a substantial 6% increase in Bitcoin (BTC) long positions held by whales — totaling a staggering 48,615 BTC.BTCUSD Longs: Bitfinex: (Source: TradingView)Analyzing Bitfinex whale activity in 2024 reveals a clear pattern: On Feb. 10, these whales held over 76,000 BTC, but by March’s all-time high, the holdings had decreased to 42,000 BTC.Notably, Bitfinex whales anticipated the flagship crypto’s subsequent decline from its peak of approximately $73,500 to $56,500 on May 1. Since hitting their lowest position on April 13, Bitfinex whales have steadily increased their holdings.Amid BTC’s recent surge from $56,500 to $62,000 over the past two days, Bitfinex whales have continued to reinforce their positions.Historical trends suggest that Bitfinex whale activity often serves as a reliable indicator of price direction. When Bitcoin prices peak, whale-long positions tend to bottom out, and these entities have capitalized on market dips to increase their position. Conversely, as prices ascend, whales gradually offload their positions.

Render Network - A Blockchain-Powered Compute Marketplace for Graphics and AI-Based Projects | Cryptoglobe


                                
The world of visual storytelling is constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. From breathtaking 3D animations to captivating special effects and the exciting possibilities of AI-generated visuals, the demand for rendering power continues to skyrocket. Finding accessible and affordable solutions is crucial for creators, studios, and now, even AI developers. This is where the Render Network (RNDR) shines.



The Render Network is a groundbreaking decentralized platform designed to connect those who need rendering power with those who have idle GPUs (graphics processing units) to offer. It functions as a vast, distributed supercomputer dedicated to rendering tasks.



Here’s how it works: Creators who need their projects rendered submit them to the Render Network. Individuals or companies (Node operators) offer their spare GPU power, and the network matches the right resources for the job. Once the rendering is complete, creators pay for the service using RNDR, the network’s native cryptocurrency. In return, Node Operators earn RNDR for contributing their computing resources.



The RNDR token is the lifeblood of the Render Network, facilitating payments for rendering services and incentivizing users to share their resources.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Beyond its core rendering capabilities, Render Network holds immense potential for the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Here’s why:



Accelerating AI Training: Training certain AI models, especially those dealing with image or video generation, can be incredibly resource-intensive. Render Network’s distributed GPU power could significantly speed up this process.Scaling AI Inference: Even after training, some AI models require substantial computing power to make inferences. Render Network offers a potential avenue for cost-effective and scalable AI inference.Distributed AI Workloads: Certain AI applications benefit from splitting tasks across multiple machines – a model well-suited to Render Network’s architecture.



Render Network is actively forging a path within the AI landscape. Collaborations with projects like Stability AI signal the platform’s commitment to supporting and optimizing AI workflows. As it continues to evolve, Render Network could become an invaluable asset for both rendering tasks and AI innovation.

EigenLayer Airdrop Outcry Shows Points are Raising Traders' Expectations - The Defiant

Eigen Layer airdropped tokens this week and there was huge backlash. Some criticism was more warranted than others but beyond allocation levels and tokenomics, the main reason the outcry was so fierce is because traders felt a social contract was broken.First, the details. EigenLayer distributed 5% of its 1.67 billion token supply this week. This was the first phase of its airdrop, which will distribute 15% of token supply to its users.Reminder that EigenLayer is DeFi’s third-largest protocol, with almost $15 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. It enables users to re-stake their Ether or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to earn additional yield by securing third-party applications called Actively Validated Services (AVS).This was a hugely anticipated airdrop – it basically mobilized an entire sector within Ethereum. For months, EigenLayer has awarded points to restakers based on the size of their deposits and how long they participated in restaking. Then, liquid restaking protocols started giving out their own points, which would compound on top of EigenLayer points to users staking there.Free Money ExpectationsTraders’ expectations that they’ll get what’s essentially “free money,” is in part what has driven over $15 billion to EigenLayer, and $10 billion to the liquid restaking sector as a whole.So, all those traders farming points and staking ETH and LSTs and LRTs had been waiting for this airdrop.But it was a disappointment to many of them and the backlash was so intense, it actually pushed EigenLayer to change the terms of the drop.Five Main PointsThe main points the EigenLayer community criticized were:EigenLayer excluded liquid restaking protocols from the dropEigen excluded users from major jurisdictions including the United States and CanadaOnly 5% of tokens were airdroppedThe linear allocation of tokens.EIGEN tokens are initially non-transferable.Let’s get the easy ones out of the way: EigenLayer excluded liquid restaking protocols from the drop, but they said they would include these in their Phase 2. The Eigen Foundation said it’s already been in touch with these teams to coordinate the airdrop.Next, the point that EigenLayer also excluded users from countries including the United States, Canada, Korea, Russia and China. This is of course because of regulatory concerns. The list of excluded countries goes on and on.In this case, I think criticism is founded, especially with regards to excluding the U.S. It is reasonable to believe that a large chunk of Eigen’s TVL comes from U.S. users. Looking at traffic for crypto websites, at least half comes from the U.S. That’s where active investors in crypto are, and where people who actually have money to invest in DeFi protocols are.Some people said, “Eigen had no issues taking money from all these risky jurisdictions, but it’s being extra careful in giving money away.” I think they’re right to call a double standard here. You can’t have it both ways.“Never Promised an Airdrop"I’ve also seen an argument that goes, “people are crying because they didn’t get an airdrop they were never promised.”To me that should be almost insulting to any web3 native. If you’re giving away points, especially if you have billions in TVL, $100 million in VC investment, and have either announced or hinted there’s a token coming up, it’s expected those points will correspond to tokens down the line.To put it in crypto terms, this is social consensus. It’s learned behavior in a community that has become a social contract. By incentivizing users with points so that they stake their money, but then not following through with the corresponding tokens, EigenLayer essentially broke that social contract.“Only 5% of Tokens”Next criticism is that “only” 5% of tokens were airdropped. This is an interesting one. The question is, is this in line with other airdrops or is it an outlier?First, it’s important to keep in mind that total airdrop accounts for 15% of total supply.If that were the total share reserved for the community, then that would indeed be extremely low. For context, token allocations saved an average of 40% of tokens to community incentives or distributions in 2023, according to a report by Liquify. Community allocation has been around 40% since 2019, the report shows.But EigenLayer is also allocating 15% of tokens to community initiatives and 15% to ecosystem development. Added all together, this community pool equals 45% – in line with what’s been the norm.In terms of the 15% allocation for the airdrop, that’s also in line with what most major projects have done. Uniswap’s airdrop was for 15% of token supply, Arbitrum’s was for 12.75%, and Jito was for 10%, according to research by IntoTheBlock.I think the reason why 15% felt like a smaller share, is because tokens were distributed among more people. There were 280,000 eligible wallets in the airdrop, compared with 250,000 wallets in the Uniswap airdrop, for instance. And that’s because points had signaled an airdrop was coming, and so more people were incentivized to re-stake ETH and participate in the ecosystem.Guaranteed MinimumNext criticism was the linear allocation of tokens, meaning eligible wallets receive EIGEN proportionally to the points they hold. For example, a wallet holding 100 Eigen points will receive 100 EIGEN. The Eigen Foundation said it chose the linear distribution approach to prevent Sybil attacks, where an individual could use multiple addresses and bots to claim a disproportionately large share of the airdrop.The big criticism here is that the small stakers are at a disadvantage.EigenLayer initially tried to balance things out for small stakers by setting aside roughly 1% of the Season 1 tokens to guarantee that each restaker gets at least 10 EIGEN. After the outcry they increased this minimum level by 100, meaning all Season 1 users will receive a minimum of 110 EIGEN.Non-TransferabiltyThe other criticism EigenLayer addressed is that EIGEN tokens are initially non-transferable, meaning that holders will not be able to sell their tokens.Eigen said the reason why they made the token non-transferable is to allow for community discussion of EIGEN’s novel design, parameters, and proposed implementation; that they wanted key payments and slashing features to be well established; and to enhanced decentralization by allowing for a broader distribution of EIGENs, including through the 15% reserved for future stakedrop seasons.The reason why it’s problematic to make the token non-transferrable is that it gives an unfair advantage to insiders, who got larger token allocations and are subject to vesting. Tokens of investors and early contributors are locked for one year, after which for the following second and third years, 4% of total tokens are unlocked each month.But say EigenLayer waited one year until the token became transferable. That means insiders can start to immediately sell their tokens as soon as it becomes tradable.EigenLayer addressed this by clarifying that the lockup countdown starts after transferability.They also provided a clearer timeline as to when the token will be transferable, saying the features they want to see enabled for transferability are targeted for the protocol’s mainnet launch in September this year.Points Changed AirdropsAfter analyzing each criticism, I understand why people were upset with the geo-block and lack of transferability, but I don’t think it’s fair to say the team was “greedy and didn’t distribute enough tokens,” as their token allocation is in line with what’s been the norm.But what’s clear is that the introduction of points has materially changed the game for airdrops. They introduced higher expectations from token distributions, and in my opinion, rightfully so. Traders and projects are effectively entering a social contract where traders put their capital at risk to perform actions projects are incentivizing with points.Why put money at risk in exchange for points? Because there is the expectation that those points will become money (via tokens) down the line. The expectation is there because that is effectively what has been playing out in DeFi, with multiple projects’ points systems effectively leading to airdrops, and entire multi-billion dollar protocols built around the concept. By awarding points, you are entering into this game and it’s disingenuous to pretend otherwise.

Has Bitcoin Price Peaked? Fundstrat Founder Tom Lee Clarifies - Bitcoin Sistemi


Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee believes that the Bitcoin price has not peaked yet.
In the latest episode of the “Speak Up” program with famous American investor Anthony Scaramucci, Lee expressed his belief that the current market situation is not a peak indicator for BTC.


“That doesn't mean it's going to reverse today, but I don't think it's a peak,” Lee said. Seeing the recent decline in Bitcoin's price as a bear trap, Lee claims that it could potentially be a good buying opportunity. “I think the April turmoil is kind of fooling us,” he added.
Lee also highlighted Bitcoin's technological breakthrough, describing it as “the purest form of trust.” He argued that Bitcoin's high level of security gives it a significant benefit.






Bitcoin has a proven track record as an asset that has been around for 15 years. Lee posed the question: “How many trillion-dollar markets have existed for 15 years and then disappeared? Never in history.”
Lee is confident that Bitcoin's price will not drop to zero due to the size of the market. He describes such a scenario as “unprecedented”:


“There have been many attempts to eliminate Bitcoin, but ultimately financial institutions are slowly starting to realize that it is actually a great solution. That's why BlackRock and others are supporting this through spot Bitcoin ETFs.”

increased demand for trading of Hong Kong's Virtual Asset ETFs soars

Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) connected to virtual assets saw a spike in trading volumes in Hong Kong. The granting of the license from the Hong Kong SFC has brought about some hope. Nonetheless, a host of other difficulties stand in the way.Strong initial trading volumes reflect Hong Kong’s investor enthusiasmETF trading volumes featuring virtual assets in Hong Kong displayed the commencement in a sound way as the overall trading volume increased to HK$48.91 million. During the day, Bitcoin ETF continued to be the ruler with the sum amount of HK$43.41 million, while Ethereum ETF conquered second place with HK$5.5 million. However, this increased volume of trading highlights greater interest in the virtual gold rush within the Hong Kong market.Despite the cautious approach, experts acknowledge that the ongoing regulatory and market challenges still remain which may hinder the technological progress since the digital transformation of the financial sector has had a significant impact on several aspects of our lives.While the green-light of virtual asset ETFs was well received the remain worry is  about the prospects of such products. In a way, crypto-ETFs can be seen as a huge step forward, but for longer-term investors, they might still be a bit skeptical. Eric Balchunas, who is the Senior ETF Analyst of Bloomberg, suggests  that there will moderate inflows of around $500 million into this market, which reflects the trouble that Hong Kong is having to reach the size of its American competitors.Market size and governmental regulation as a resistanceAnalysts provide various justifications for placing conservative estimates. Against the backdrop of the US market of $15 trillion, Hong Kong ETF, at $50 billion in value, is not that large. In addition, impediments of control imposed by the Chinese regulators on their local citizens in the stipulation for these ETFs demand limit their desires for purchase.prominent players such as BlackRock which are absent in the Hong Kong ETF market support the invests of larger sizes.there are plans that the infrastructure of the Hong Kong market is yet to be equitable and efficient similar to the substitute US market. Unrelated to this, we realize that this inefficiency causes premium discounts and wider spreads for exchange-traded funds which can possibly cause accomplished investors who are already accustomed to the convenience of the US market to lose interest.If another reason is to be added, the higher fees are also contributing to the low estimate for the ETF investment, but it may be between 1%~2%. If investors who are used to paying for low-cost securities in the US fees are options, this can be a turn-off. As per BalchunasImplications for the futurethe success of virtual asset ETFs in Hong Kong can only be assessed in the long run. The initial numbers of trading volumes may indicate their promising future for the region, however, the comparison with the scale and dominance of the US virtual asset ETFs may give a clearer perspective of whether Hong Kong can match up to their American counterparts. The initial fruitful stream submission is a tell-tale sign of the rising eagerness for virtual assets investment in the area.Hong Kong’s crypto ETFs immediately receive robust trading volumes upon their launch underlines the challenge ahead of the industry as it strives to solidify itself as a highly competitive player in a crowded international space.

Poisoned Wallet Address Loses $70 Million in ‘Very Suspicious’ WBTC Transaction - The Defiant

A fake transaction led a user to send 1,155 WBTC to the wrong address.An unsuspecting user lost $69 million in WBTC today after sending the funds to an address linked with an attack known as address poisoning.Web3 cybersecurity firm Certik first alerted of the malicious transaction early Friday morning. The attacker mimicked a transfer of 0.05 ETH, or $150, which led the victim to send the funds to the wrong address, according to Certik’s X account.Poisoning addresses refers to attackers sending spam transactions to an address in order to confuse inattentive users. Users then copy the fraudulent address–which usually begins and ends with the same six digits– instead of sending funds to a legitimate wallet address.Hackers can know an address linked to a user’s exchange account because of recurring payments and other transaction flows.Low Success RateThe pseudonymous Officer, a threat researcher formerly of the Web3 cybersecurity firm ImmuneFi, told The Defiant that these types of attacks are very common but usually have a low success rate.According to Etherscan, after the attack, the perpetrator moved the funds in eight separate transactions.According to Officer, many users are lazy when operating in the crypto space.“A lot of people have a bad habit of blind copying the last address from their transaction history, just to be sure,” he said. Hackers take advantage of this behavior by sending small sums of crypto from similar-looking addresses.Triple CheckHow to counter such attacks?“Don't trust Clipboard especially given the fact that malware with almost the same scheme exists (it usually targets a clipboard), check all digits one by one and add hot addresses to the allow list (if possible),” he warned.Exploits have been on a negative curve during 2024.Hackers stole $336 million in crypto in the first quarter this year, a 23% drop from the same time last year, according to the latest report by Web3 security firm ImmuneFi.

Crypto startups received $935 million from VC funds in April - Crypto Briefing




Venture capital (VC) funds invested $935 million in crypto startups in April, according to data aggregator DefiLlama. The amount is 8% smaller than the total invested in March, which had the largest monthly fundraising since October 2022.Investments in crypto startups focused on building blockchain infrastructure surpassed $730 million, representing 78% of all the amount raised last month. This is even more than the $655 million seen in March, the month with the largest infrastructure allocations in the first quarter.Layer-1 blockchain Monad registered the largest fundraising round in the period, with $225 million received from players such as Paradigm, Electric Capital, and Coinbase Ventures.Berachain is another layer-1 blockchain that received a significant amount of funding in April, totaling $100 million invested by Framework Ventures, Samsung Next, Arrington Capital, and many others.Moreover, a $90 million private sale of OP tokens from Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Optimism to a16z on April 30 adds to the infrastructure investments.The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector also received more funding from VCs in April, with $157 million captured last month surpassing March by $50 million. Ellipsis Labs received $20 million in a round led by Paradigm to build an on-chain liquidity primitive on Solana’s blockchain.Another sector in crypto that received more attention from VCs in April is the Web3-focused applications sector, jumping from gathering $3 million in March to $19 million in April. The startup Legitimate led the investments with $4.3 million received last month to build its product aimed at bridging the physical and digital worlds.Web3 gaming was the only sector in the blockchain industry that registered a smaller capital influx from VCs into its projects, sliding from $83 million to $24.7 million in April. Crypto gaming studio Avalon received $10 million from VCs, almost half of all the funding directed at this sector last month.

CFTC Commissioner Johnson Proposes AI Recommendations, Looping in DeFi - Benzinga

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Kristin Johnson proposed recommendations such as heightened penalties to address artificial intelligence in financial markets, including decentralized finance. In a speech delivered at the Sidley Austin and Rutgers Law School Fintech and Blockchain Symposium, Commissioner Johnson outlined her concerns about AI and how that applies to DeFi. "Deploying AI in ecosystems running on blockchain technology raises novel issues for supervision, risk management, and compliance, as well as enforcement" Johnson said on Friday. AI has been integrated into financial markets, including brokerage apps, compliance programs and robo-advisers. In DeFi, AI can be used in automated trading and algorithmic trading. AI in general has raised concerns among regulators over risks such as manipulation and fraud, bias and customer protection. Read the full story at The Block.Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Victim Loses Over $71 Million Worth of WBTC in Purported 'Address Poisoning' Attack - Benzinga

Someone lost over $71 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin WBTC/USD in what appears to be an address poisoning attack. The victim transferred 1,155 WBTC ($71.1 million) to the alleged attacker, according to on-chain transfers from the Etherscan blockchain explorer.  A poisoning attack when the hacker conjures a wallet address similar to the victim's, either through vanity address services or through address mining, and spams the victim with numerous transactions. If the victim accidentally copies the hacker's fake address, they'll have transferred their funds to the hacker instead of to their own. Read the full story at The Block.Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Dogecoin Rival Shiba Inu (SHIB) Completes Highly Anticipated Shibarium Hard Fork - The Daily Hodl


								Dogecoin (DOGE) competitor Shiba Inu (SHIB) is announcing the completion of its highly anticipated Shibarium hard fork.
In a new thread on the social media platform X, the team behind the dog-themed meme asset says they have officially completed the Shibarium hard fork, a move traders have been expecting since last year.










“Shibarium has successfully completed its hard fork at block height 4504576! Get ready for: blazing-fast transactions and predictable gas fees!”
Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution, initially released a beta bridge for public use in July 2023. It utilized both plasma and proof-of-stake (PoS) technology to allow investors to shift tokens between Shibarium and the leading smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH).
In June 2023, Lucie, a content market specialist for Shiba Inu, detailed the benefits of Shibarium, including lower gas fees, faster transactions, more use cases for the Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) digital asset, as well as enhanced security features.
 “Shibarium empowers projects by offering scalability, cost-effectiveness, and enhanced security. The reduced gas fees on Shibarium can have a significant impact on Bone, increasing its demand and potential value.
With Shibarium, projects have the opportunity to innovate, expand, and create a more accessible and thriving decentralized ecosystem.” 
In September 2023, it was reported that Shibarium was growing rapidly, surpassing 2.5 million transactions overall, reaching 200,000 daily transactions on average. Furthermore, it was revealed that the protocol had over 1.2 million unique wallet addresses using its service while the amount of BONE reached 27.1 million.
SHIB is trading for $0.000024 at time of writing, a 5.2% increase during the last 24 hours.

Crypto Downturn a Buying Opportunity: BitMEX Founder Says ‘Buy in May, Go Away’ | Cryptoglobe


                                
Arthur Hayes, the founder of popular cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform BitMEX, has recently shared his analysis of the recent turmoil in the cryptocurrency markets. He predicts a local bottom has been hit and suggests upcoming rangebound action.



In a post titled “Mayday” on the BitMEX blog, Hayes attributed the volatility seen in the cryptocurrency space to a confluence of factors that included the conclusion of the U.S. tax season, anxieties surrounding potential Federal Reserve policy changes, Bitcoin’s recent halving event, and stagnant growth in assets under management for spot U.S. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



Hayes revealed he views the recent downturn as a necessary correction for speculative excesses and suggested that “tourists” will likely sit out the upcoming recovery, while experienced investors will HODL and potentially accumulate more established assets like Bitcoin and Ether, and potentially take advantage of “high-beta” (more volatile) cryptocurrencies like Dog Wif Hat and other memecoins.



A central theme in Hayes’ analysis is the Federal Reserve’s recent adjustments to its quantitative tightening (QT) program. Initially aiming to reduce bond purchases by $95 billion per month, the Fed has scaled this back to $60 billion, something Hayes interprets as a disguised form of quantitative easing, injecting an additional $35 billion per month back into the dollar liquidity pool.



He argues that when combined with other measures, this reduction in QT effectively increases the stimulus provided to global financial markets. Hayes also examined recent actions by the U.S. Treasury Department, led by Secretary Janet Yellen and dissected the Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA) which forecasts borrowing and cash balances for upcoming quarters.



The QRA for the second quarter of the year projects borrowing $243 billion, $41 billion above prior estimates due to lower-than-expected tax revenue. Hayes suggests this increased Treasury issuance could lead to higher long-term interest rates and speculated that Yellen might counter this with yield curve control measures, a scenario that could potentially trigger a significant rally in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.



The recent collapse of Republic First Bank also entered into Hayes’ analysis, as he criticized the swift response by monetary authorities, which ensured all depositors were compensated.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

While this may appear reassuring, Hayes argued it masks underlying vulnerabilities within the U.S. banking system and added that this “safety net” effectively guarantees even uninsured deposits, leading to a form of hidden money printing by the government which could fuel further inflationary pressures. He wrote:



Like the other stealth money printing policies discussed in this essay, there is no massive liquidity injection today. However, we now know with full confidence that trillions of contingent liabilities have been added to the Fed’s balance sheet, which will be funded with printed money.



Unfazed by the recent market turbulence, Hayes advocates for active investment, creating a section titled “buy in May, go away” in a play on the popular financial saying “sell in May and go away” that is based on stocks’ historical underperformance between May and October.



Hayes recommended investors reender the market as the “slow addition of billions of dollars of liquidity each month will dampen negative price movement from here on out,” and while he doesn’t expected “ crypto to fully realize the recent US monetary announcements’ inflationary nature immediately, I expect prices to bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher. “



Per his words the “recent intense puke” provides him an opportunity to buy Solana and “doggie coins for momentum trading position,” while longer-term position will see him “identify other tokens” he believes are undervalued.



He noted that after accumulating this month he will “ set it, forget it, and wait for the market to appreciate the inflationary nature of the recent US monetary policy announcements.”



In his footnotes, he suggested he believes Bitcoin hit a local low earlier this week below the $58,000 mark and believes it will now rally to surpass $60,000 and enter a range-bound period between $60,000 and $70,000 until August.

OKX Latest To Fold in Nigeria's War on Crypto, Pulls Naira P2P - DailyCoin


        
OKX has removed naira support from its p2p platform.



The crypto exchange’s move comes after Nigerian authorities forced Binance to do so over a month ago.



Local reports indicate that a blanket ban on crypto p2p trading may be in the works.
Nigerian crypto users are quickly running out of options.As part of efforts to stem the free fall of the naira, the country’s local currency, authorities have turned their attention to the crypto sector, alleging that peer-to-peer (p2p) traders are manipulating the naira through pump-and-dump strategies. In line with this reasoning, the country’s central bank has launched a wide-reaching campaign against the crypto industry that, till now, has seen most of the focus on Binance, forcing the firm to shut down its naira p2p platform and charging it for money laundering and tax evasion.However, as authorities have repeatedly made clear, Binance is not the only firm in its crosshairs. Following Binance, OKX has now also seized naira p2p support.Changing Market RequirementsAs of Friday, May 3, the Nigerian naira could no longer be found on OKX’s p2p marketplace. 
OKX confirmed the removal of the currency from the platform in an X post from its official help desk account, citing “a change in local market requirements.”“We understand that this change might have an impact on your trading preferences, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause,” the team added.
Most Nigerian crypto users have been left wondering which exchange would be the next domino to fall while decrying the potential effects on young people who have built businesses and streams of income around the sector.The recent OKX move comes as rumors of a looming crypto p2p ban gain momentum.Back to Square One?On Friday, May 3, a local news outlet reported that at least three fintech startups in the country, including Moniepoint, Paga, and Palmpay, will block the accounts of users engaging in crypto p2p trading and report suspected transactions to authorities in line with the National Security Adviser (NSA) designating crypto trading as a national security issue.According to two persons familiar with the matter that the outlet cited, regulations to impose a ban on crypto p2p trading will soon be unveiled. If it happens, the ban would effectively be a U-turn on the Central Bank’s December 2023 decision to lift a two-year ban on banks facilitating crypto transactions.Meanwhile, this week, authorities have already frozen the accounts of over 1,000 crypto traders in the country amid ongoing investigations into money laundering and terrorism financing.On the Flipside 
Nigerian OKX users can still access other services on the platform and transfer their assets to other platforms if desired.



A recent circular dubbed as fake by Nigeria’s central bank had instructed banks to freeze the accounts of cryptocurrency traders, stoking crypto ban fears.
Why This MattersOKX’s move to cease naira support on its p2p platform suggests Nigeria’s crackdown on crypto is intensifying, foreboding a potential blanket ban on crypto p2p transactions. This move could force crypto p2p transactions to move to encrypted messaging platforms lacking the escrow services offered by exchanges, exposing users to greater risks of scams.Read this for more on Nigeria’s war on crypto:Unraveling Binance’s Nigeria Woes as Govt Hunts User InfoLearn more about a recent move from a hitherto dormant Ethereum whale:$5.5M Move Shakes Ethereum as Genesis-Era Wallet Awakens

Bitcoin Analyst Says Rally To Over $90,000 Programmed As Money Supply Grows


								Bitcoin price action might be dicey, undergoing a major corrective phase. However, even as $60,000 looks slippery for upbeat bulls, some analysts are optimistic that the coin is ready for a strong leg up. 
Going by past price action, analysts maintain that the coin will surge above $73,800 and register fresh all-time highs closer to or higher than $100,000 in this projected expansion.
Historical Price Action Places BTC Above $90,000 In Coming Months
One analyst, posting on platform X, offered a bold prediction based on price action from late 2022. Then, Bitcoin spectacularly collapsed to as low as $15,500 before bouncing back sharply throughout 2023 and Q1 2024. 
Bitcoin may surge to at least $90,000 | Source: Analyst on X
Therefore, if Bitcoin follows this formation, the coin will soar to $90,000 and even reach $100,000. While the timeframe for this potential surge remains unclear, another analyst on platform Y chimed in with a specific prediction.

In a post on X, the analyst said it is imperative that Bitcoin trades above $60,000 so that the uptrend momentum doesn’t fizzle. This resilience will form the base of a leg up that will see Bitcoin roar to as high as $95,000 by August 2024. The timing of this potential peak is because, the analyst explains, price action is fractal and thus tends to rhyme.
Bitcoin price trending upwards on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView
Further bolstering this bullish outlook, another analyst noted that after prices sunk to as low as $56,500 this week, it retested a key support trend line. 
Since this trend line is held, the analyst predicts that “it is only a matter of time” before prices shoot higher. However, prices will flip green if there is a close above the current all-time high of $73,800.
Inflation Remains High And M2 Supply In The United States Growing
With the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Bitcoin is now interwoven with global markets. Accordingly, key events in traditional finance will likely impact crypto prices and sentiment. One key metric that investors and analysts have been monitoring is inflation. 
Related Reading: FTX Exec Loses Paradise, Surrenders $5.9 Million Bahamas Mansion
Inflation has been higher than the benchmark 2% in the United States, an obstacle preventing the Federal Reserve from slashing rates further. 

However, even as inflation drops—from the 2021 to 2024 cycle—the M2 money supply has been rising, according to FRED Economic data. The last time it grew, it triggered a bull run that forced the coin to fresh all-time highs of around $70,000.

Developers of Popular Altcoin Announce Two More Tokens - Also Launching Farming - Bitcoin Sistemi


MakerDAO, a leading platform in decentralized finance (DeFi), announced that it plans to introduce two new tokens to its ecosystem, NewStable (NST) and NewGovToken (NGT). The official names of these tokens will be announced at an upcoming brand launch.
NewStable was introduced as the codename for an upgraded version of Dai, MakerDAO's existing stablecoin. According to the official statement, this new token is designed for wider adoption and comes with improved stability features. According to the statement, there will be a possibility of constantly returning from this token to DAI, another stablecoin.




In addition, NST holders will have the opportunity to farm to earn NGT from launch. A total of NGT 600 million will be distributed annually to participating NST holders through farming.






According to the statement, NewGovToken represents a refined approach to governance in the MakerDAO ecosystem. It is designed to encourage broader participation and more dynamic decision-making processes. Each Maker (MKR) token can be converted into 24,000 NGT.
The total supply of NewGovToken has been strategically renominated compared to MKR. Therefore, during the upgrade, each MKR will convert into 24,000 NewGovTokens. This revaluation of NewGovToken will result in more users owning a significant number of NewGovTokens.


According to the official statement, these innovations represent an expansion and will not replace the existing Dai (DAI) and Maker (MKR) tokens.

Solana Enters Buy Territory On Major Crypto Market Rebound - DailyCoin


        
Solana has experienced a significant rally.



Technical indicators move decisively in the buy territory. 



The overall crypto market trends have been positive.
After a brief decline, Solana has entered what appears to be a bullish phase once again, as a part of a broader positive movement in the crypto markets. The bullish momentum comes amid a positive macroeconomic shift and corporate adoption. What’s Behind the Crypto Market SurgeOn Friday, May 3, Solana’s rose to $142, up 3% from the previous day. Its performance followed a larger trend in the crypto market, as the crypto market cap in the same period increased by 3.75% within 24 hours, reaching $2.29 trillion. This surge was influenced by several major developments, including macroeconomic factors and adoption.  Firstly, the Federal Reserve has signaled a shift towards a less hawkish monetary policy, maintaining the interest rates unchanged at 5.25% to 5.50% while indicating the potential for three rate cuts in the coming year. This shift is good for riskier assets like crypto, as investors divest from low-yielding bonds​. 
Adding to the sentiment, PayPal announced a partnership with cryptocurrency firm MoonPay, opening its ecosystem to crypto trading. The move opens up crypto to PayPal’s 426 million customers worldwide. In light of this, Solana’s technical indicators have shown a significant bullish reversal. What Solana’s Technicals SaySolana’s recent increase to $142.09 is supported by several short-term buying signals from its moving averages. The 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Simple Moving Average (SMA) stand at 139.63 and 138.94, respectively, both indicating a buy. However, medium-term indicators signal caution. Specifically, the 20-day EMA and SMA, at 144.90 and 142.20, respectively, and the 30-day EMA and SMA, at 148.94 and 151.71, all hint at sell signals. These suggest that Solana might face resistance near these higher average values.
Oscillators, which help identify market momentum and potential reversal points, also show a mixed sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), sitting at 45.93, shows a neutral position, not in overbought or oversold territory. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), with a value of -7.02, indicates a buy signal. This suggests increasing bullish momentum, which if sustained, could push Solana’s price further up. Other oscillators like the Stochastic RSI and the Commodity Channel Index are also in neutral zones. Given the latest surge, Solana demonstrates robust short-term growth, supported by favorable technical indicators. However, the mixed signals from medium-term moving averages and oscillators suggest a potential reversal in the future.On the Flipside
Solana has been experiencing ongoing congestion issues, leading to a significant increase in transaction failures. However, these issues have not deterred Solana investors. 



Technical analysis indicates the current market sentiment, rather than a prediction of future price movements. 
Why This MattersThe recent rise in Solana’s price, with the broader crypto market, is significant because it reflects increased investor confidence and market acceptance. Such movements suggest that cryptocurrencies are becoming more integrated into the mainstream financial ecosystem.Read more about the recent Solana price movement. Solana Sees Momentum Dwindle as Updates Fail to Fix CongestionRead more about the ZKasino rug pull: ZKasino $32M Scam Suspect Arrested: Here’s What We Know

XRP Forms On-Chain Signal That Led To 16% Crash Last Time


                            On-chain data shows that many old coins have moved on the XRP network recently, a sign that proved to be bearish for the coin last time.
XRP Age Consumed Metric Has Registered A Large Spike
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, XRP has just observed a large movement of dormant coins similar to what the asset witnessed last month.
The indicator of interest here is the “Age Consumed,” which shows “the amount of tokens changing addresses on a certain date, multiplied by the time since they last moved,” as per Santiment’s definition.

When this metric has a high value, it means that a large number of coins previously dormant have finally been moved to the blockchain. Old coins are generally less likely to become involved in selling, as they belong to the more resolute hands in the market. As such, any large movements of these coins can be worth noting since it’s not an event that happens too often.
The below chart shows the trend in this indicator for XRP over the past month or so:

The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on X
From the graph, it’s visible that the XRP Age Consumed registered a sharp spike at the start of this month, implying that some old hands have decided to break their silence.
This latest spike has been quite massive in scale and has been reminiscent of another spike that was seen last month. Interestingly, this previous spike occurred shortly before the price of the cryptocurrency tanked 16%.
Thus, the previous spike would have corresponded to some HODLers moving to sell their coins. It’s possible that the latest large dormant coin movement was also made for a similar purpose, and hence, it can prove to be bearish for XRP.
Santiment points out that this may not be so after all, though, saying:
There is an argument that this old coin movement is related to potential #buythedip interest from key stakeholders, and prices have been climbing mildly since this May spike occurred.
While this dormant coin movement may turn out to be bullish this time around, there is another signal brewing for the asset that can also be something to keep an eye on.
As highlighted in the same chart, the Total Open Interest for XRP, which keeps track of the number of derivative positions currently open on all exchanges related to the asset, has been going up recently.
This metric is now at a 3-week high of $483.4 million, implying that there is a notable amount of speculation in the market right now. Historically, this has led to volatility in the price.

In theory, this volatility can take the asset in either direction, but it’s worth noting that the crash last month occurred after the Open Interest hit extreme levels. So far, though, the indicator hasn’t quite yet reached the same highs.
XRP Price
XRP is yet to make any significant recovery from the crash last month as its price is still trading around $0.52.

Dogecoin Open Interest Crashes 66.5% In One Month, What Does This Mean For Price? | Bitcoinist.com


								The Dogecoin open interest has seen a massive crash in the last month, leading to concerns about the future prospects of the meme coin. It is now a long way from its March all-time highs and has returned to the low levels of early February.
Dogecoin Open Interest Sees 66.5% Crash
In March, the Dogecoin open interest had risen to a new all-time high of $1.91 billion after a month of steady increase. This was followed by an increase in the DOGE price as investors rushed to join the rally and secure gains. This steady growth would continue into the start of April, but since then, the price has been on a downtrend.

Data from Coinglass shows that on April 1, the total Dogecoin open interest came out to $1.87 billion. But in the space of one week, the open interest had fallen by $600 million. The decline continued through to the end of April and by the end of the month, the open interest was at $763 million.

Source: Coinglass
With the month of May following the bearish trend of April, the decline in the open interest has been constant. At the time of writing, the total Dogecoin open interest is sitting at $625.7 million, a whopping 66.5% crash from its $1.87 billion level just a month ago.
The last time the Dogecoin open interest was this low was toward the end of February. However, the open interest is still a long way from its January lows when it was trending below $300 million. At the same time, the DOGE price is also higher, suggesting the last few months have been quite good for the meme coin.
How Will DOGE Price React?
The reaction to a sharp drop in open interest has always been the same, ending with the price of the cryptocurrency seeing a decline. Dogecoin has stuck to this trend as its price has dumped almost 50% at the same time as bears continue to exert dominance.

If the DOGE open interest continues to decline, then investors can expect the price to follow the same path. Such a crash could send the Dogecoin price below the $0.12 support, which could be the start of a downward spiral.
However, if the open interest does recover, then a reversal in price is expected as well. Mostly, this would depend on how the price of Bitcoin performs from now on, but as interest begins to grow and traders take more positions, it gives room for Dogecoin to grow.

FLOKI's trend reversal depends on THIS key factor panning out - AMBCrypto



Positive sentiment and interactions around Floki Inu grew significantly over the last few days
Despite the surge in price, however, holders remained unprofitable

Once upon a time, Floki Inu [FLOKI] was left behind as other memecoins entered the market and flooded social media platforms with hype. However, recent data suggests that this could finally be changing.
A rise in popularity
According to LunarCrush’s data, FLOKI has dominated the field in terms of social activity. Apart from Solana, the memecoin has outperformed all other coins in this space. Over the last 24 hours, the positive sentiment around the altcoin grew by 89%. Additionally, the number of interactions FLOKI was having across social media platforms also surged.
Because Floki is a memecoin, the success of the token depends on its popularity on social media.
Source: X
Looking at the price
Due to the surge in activity on social media platforms, the price of FLOKI surged materially. In the last 24 hours alone, the price of FLOKI hiked by 6.19%. However, this surge in price did not translate to a bullish trend. In fact, since 28 March, the price of FLOKI has fallen on the charts. After the decline in price, FLOKI continued to hit lower lows and lower highs – Indicative of a bearish trend.
For FLOKI to reverse the trend and rally again, its price would have to break past the $0.00020873-level in the future. It would need massive bullish momentum to do the same. While the RSI (Relative Strength Index) for FLOKI hiked to 51.4, the uptick wasn’t significant enough for a big move.
Moreover, the CMF(Chaikin Money Flow) for the token also declined, pointing to heightened selling pressure on FLOKI’s markets. It remains to be seen whether the price of FLOKI succumbs to the selling pressure or not.
Source: Trading View
How are holders doing?
A massive factor that contributes to selling pressure of a token is the profitability of addresses. If holders become profitable in a very short span of time, they are much likely to sell their holdings. This was not the case with FLOKI.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the MVRV ratio of FLOKI declined, indicating that most holders are yet to see profits. This means that the price of FLOKI could surge further before holders indulge in profit taking, while subsequently causing a correction.

Realistic or not, here’s FLOKI market cap in BTC‘s terms

Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Snaps Losing Streak, Pulls In $63 Million - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more!

I had to run my eyes and double check the data but it’s true."He added: “On a scale of 1-10 how ‘we’re so back’ is this?”GBTC is still the largest Bitcoin spot ETF, with over $18.7 billion assets under management (AUM), coupled to about 297,000 Bitcoin. But constant outflows allowed newer competitors to close the gap, and the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has $17.2 billion AUM as of Tuesday.The good news for Grayscale comes soon after spot Bitcoin ETFs logged their worst day on record, when half a billion dollars in net outflows coincided with a drop in the price of BTC on Wednesday.Bitcoin ETFs saw mid-week outflows of $563 million, CoinGlass data showed, overshadowing the previous daily record $326 million set n in mid-March.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Coinbase's Base could make it the NVIDIA of DeFia

Coinbase’s first-quarter earnings report — released May 2 — indicated the company has been thriving thanks to a vibrant market for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) over the last several months. However, the numbers indicated Base platform has shown even greater potential — and could make Coinbase the NVIDIA of decentralized finance (DeFi).Launched in August 2023, Base is a secure, low-cost Ethereum layer-2 solution built to scale Coinbase’s user base on-chain to make transactions faster. Coinbase’s vision is to decentralize Base and create an open, global crypto ecosystem leveraging the security of the Ethereum mainnet, which is accessible to everyone. According to Coinbase’s Q1 report, volume on Base has surged past its competitors, particularly after the rollout of Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade. DeFi crypto exchanges on Base saw daily trading volume surpass $1 billion per day, narrowing the gap between Coinbase’s main centralized exchange trading volumes, where almost 250 cryptocurrencies are traded.Related: Crypto leaders should stop flirting with CBDCsThe Dencun upgrade significantly boosted activity on Base. Within a short span, Base experienced a surge in daily transaction volume and revenue, surpassing competitors like Optimism and Arbitrum. The upgrade reduced costs for layer-2 scaling chains such as Base and led to a surge in user engagement and transaction volume.New Base users have climbed by more than 8 million between July 2023 and May 2024. Source: DuneSince the upgrade, Base has consistently processed more than 3 million transactions daily, substantially lifting its fee revenue. If this pace is sustained, Base could become a big growth driver for Coinbase. Since the Dencun upgrade, the fees that Base has earned have surpassed the other major Ethereum scaling networks.The spike in Base’s revenue is attributed to its support for DeFi protocols, with roughly 250 protocols currently operating on the network. Its impressive rise in market share in such short period of time illustrates Base’s potential — and undergirds the case that Coinbase could become the NVIDIA of DeFi as a long-term industry leader. Outlook for Q2Now that Bitcoin's halving — one of its major price drivers — is over, the outlook for cryptos may turn back to macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation, the direction of stock markets and geopolitical tensions. The Federal Reserve’s “higher for longer” stance is one of the catalysts that could set a risk-off mood in the markets and exert downward pressure on riskier assets. Coinbase provided good guidance for the second quarter of 2024, but cautioned that results will depend on crypto prices. Since Bitcoin peaked in mid-March trading volumes have been declining, and the second quarter is likely to be weaker than the first, especially if crypto prices continue to slide. Over the long-term, Bitcoin’s bull run is likely to resume. Higher price levels are in the cards. But in the short-term, further weakness is likely to unfold.Coinbase custodian fee revenue is expected to riseCoinbase revenue from transactions is roughly half of net revenue. The other half comes from non-transactions revenue, which encompass subscriptions and services: stablecoin revenue, custodial fees, blockchain rewards, and interest income. The non-transactions revenue has seen a strong growth over the past two years and could offset fluctuations in transactions revenue, which is highly correlated to cryptocurrencies prices. Coinbase is the custodian for eight of the 11 new Bitcoin ETFs launched on Jan. 10. These ETFs have reached close to $60 billion in assets under management in the first quarter of 2024. Coinbase charges a fee for assets under custody, which are a few basis-points on the assets under custody. As the assets under management in these ETFs increase, Coinbase custodian fees would rise too. Coinbase custodian fee revenue was $19.7 million in Q4’23. After the launch of the Bitcoin ETFs in mid-January, Coinbase revenue from custody fees rose 90% to $32.3 million. Cryptocurrency custodians have a similar role to banks in traditional finance – to settle trades, manage regulatory reporting, keep, and manage clients’ assets. However, for crypto markets the process is more complex as it is more specific to digital assets. Also, the technology, security and storage requirements are different. Base could offset some future declines in trading volumesWhile Base is likely to become a contributor to Coinbase’s top line revenue, it is likely to take some time. The additional — possibly substantial — source of revenue could help Coinbase's share price loosen its correlation to cryptocurrency price in the future. Related: Jerome Powell’s pivot heralds a boring summer for BitcoinOverall, there is still huge potential for cryptos to grow thanks to the United States' 11 Bitcoin ETFs. Likewise, six Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs launched in Hong Kong in April, and the Australian Securities Exchange may also approve its first Bitcoin ETFs before 2025.These factors are likely to offer consistent support for crypto in the long run, which will be beneficial for Coinbase transaction and non-transaction revenue. While declining crypto prices are likely to weigh on Coinbase’s share price in the short-term, Coinbase’s diversification of revenue drivers is likely to lead to higher share prices in the long-term.Violeta Todorova is a guest columnist for Cointelegraph and a senior research analyst for Leverage Shares.

                        While many market segments panic-sold their Bitcoin (BTC) this week, the digital currency’s largest whales seem to have bought the dip with size.Whales Buy The Bitcoin Dip
According to data provided by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, active Bitcoin whale addresses accumulated 47,000 BTC within 24 hours following Bitcoin’s slide this week below $57,000 per coin.An active whale address is defined as owning at least 100 BTC, and having engaged in on-chain activity within the past day. Young Ju said the balances discount centralized exchanges and Bitcoin miners, but include certain Bitcoin custodians such as Bitcoin ETF providers.“We’re entering a new era,” Young Ju wrote to Twitter regarding the data. Though whale balances have significantly increased since Bitcoin spot ETFs were approved in the United States this year, the executive says this week’s balance spike was “not ETF related.”A day prior, Young Ju highlighted how new Bitcoin whales, including spot ETF buyers, went underwater on their investments after Bitcoin plunged under $60,800.Similarly, analysis from lead Glassnode analyst James Check found that Bitcoin’s broader short-term holder cost basis as of Wednesday was $59,600. Statistically, short-term holders are more likely to panic sell their holdings once their cost basis is lost, exacerbating price volatility at the time.Regardless, Check also said that the dip was of a standard size seen in typical Bitcoin bull markets, and predicted it would make a good time to buy. As of Friday, Bitcoin has surged back to $62,700, proving profitable for anyone who followed his advice.Interpreting The Data
According to analyst TXMCtrades, the increased whale address balance may actually not represent whales accumulating coins, but instead show “innocuous wallet management flow” among larger entities.“There are hundreds/thousands of unidentified on-chain entities with big footprints, but people who don’t look at this data all day will be encouraged to leap to wild conclusions,” he wrote to Twitter on Friday.Bitcoin ETF data shows that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) had net inflows on Friday for the first time since launching as a Bitcoin spot ETF, possibly signaling the first strong inflow day for Bitcoin ETFs at large in almost a month.

                        In a major step towards launching its native token, ZRO, cross-chain interoperability protocol LayerZero successfully completed its first airdrop snapshot on May 1. The snapshot marks a crucial stage in the protocol’s development and has generated considerable excitement within the DeFi community.LayerZero Labs confirmed the completion of the airdrop snapshot via an X post on May 2. The snapshot will determine the allocation of ZRO tokens to eligible participants upon the official launch, expected to occur in the first half of 2024.“LayerZero will have a native token within the protocol, and its distribution is expected to happen in the first half of 2024,” the announcement read.Anticipation for the ZRO token launch is already evident, particularly on decentralized exchanges. On Hyperliquid, the world’s largest perps DEX, a perpetual futures contract for ZRO, is currently trading at $8.4. This suggests a fully diluted valuation of approximately $17 billion for the forthcoming token.Potential Implications of the LayerZero AirdropWhile the LayerZero airdrop presents an exciting opportunity for the protocol and its community, it raises concerns about the potential impact of Sybil users. These individuals claim airdrops with multiple cryptocurrency wallets solely to sell the rewards without any intention of long-term engagement with the protocol. This practice can lead to a sharp decline in the price of the newly airdropped token following its launch.Several past airdrops have been affected by airdrop hunters. In February, it was revealed that the eligibility list for Starknet’s airdrop was predominantly composed of Sybil users, with 701,544 addresses out of 1.3 million linked to their activity. Similarly, in March 2023, 1,496 wallets belonging to airdrop hunters accumulated over $3.3 million worth of tokens from the Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop, contributing to a subsequent price decline.

                        With blue-chip cryptocurrency markets recovering on Friday as macro traders price back in multiple rate cuts for 2024 following the latest US jobs report, traders looking for top crypto gainers today continue to turn to the highly illiquid and volatile on-chain markets for opportunities.On-chain markets refer to the market for crypto tokens and assets issued directly on the blockchain.For example, Shiba Inu (SHIB), crypto’s second-largest meme coin, was issued as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum.It can be traded off-chain on centralized exchanges, but the “real” SHIB trade all occurs on Ethereum.Wallets can send these tokens between themselves, or SHIB can be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEX).There is virtually no barrier to anyone launching their own token on a blockchain like Ethereum.That’s why new meme coins and shitcoins are popping up all the time. New coins often post fast exponential gains – this is why traders flock to the on-chain market. To try to hit the jackpot.But in these highly illiquid markets, a token can lose virtually all of its value in next to no time.And that’s not the only risk. Most newly launched tokens are either scams or pump and dump schemes and have no long-term value.Traders must always do their due diligence before investing. And traders must never risk more than they can afford to lose.That being said, here are some top crypto gainers today on Ethereum, according to DEX analytics tool DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayArky (ARKY)A new dog meme coin called Arky (ARKY), which claims to be named after the Bitcoin founder’s dog, is pumping.Last up 15,300% as per DEXScreener, it’s one of the top crypto gainers today.https://twitter.com/Arky_Coin/status/1786257974639661389The token last had a market cap of around $630,000 with around $100,000 in locked liquidity.The token has two issues with its smart contract, so traders should be careful. That being said, the community appears to like this coin.ARKY has 82 rock emoji votes on DEXScreener versus only 3 shitcoin votes and 7 red flag votes.PEEPO (PEEPO)A shitcoin called PEEPO (PEEPO) that has been around for over a year has suddenly sprung into life.As per DEXScreener, it just hit new yearly highs after pumping 320%.The token’s market cap was last around $5.6 million,  with around $930,000 in locked liquidity.Having been around over a year, PEEPO probably isn’t a scam at this point. More of just a failed meme coin trying to make a comeback.Three Protocol Token (THREE)Three Protocol Token (THREE) is pumping on Friday, having gained 100% in 24 hours as per DEXScreener.The decentralized marketplace-focused protocol’s token was last at a market cap of around $28 million.The token has amassed an impressive $800,000 in locked liquidity and only has one smart contract issue.Alternative Investment Strategy to Consider – Presales
If traders can reliably identify micro-cap gems, they can make a great return.But an often over-looked strategy can potentially net even higher gains if executed correctly. Investing in crypto presales/ICOs.Web3 projects/protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to fund development.If investors can reliably identify projects that, thanks to their strong vision, use case and competent team, end up gaining traction in the market, they can make big profits.Knowing where to start is one of the biggest barriers to entry in the daunting presale market.That’s why Cryptonews put together a list of their top picks.20 Best Crypto Presales to Invest In

Brian Armstrong Calls Coinbase's Base Top Layer 2 Solution


Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has stated that Base now leads as the top Layer-2 solution by transaction volume. 
Base harnesses “optimistic rollups” to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs by batching transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain. These transactions are later consolidated and finalized on the Ethereum mainnet, maintaining the high-security standards for which Ethereum is known. This efficient process significantly lowers costs.
 Top Layer 2 Solution With the Highest Transaction Volume
Armstrong detailed the innovations driving this shift during the first-quarter earnings call on May 2, 2024. The significant transaction volume on the network represents a significant leap in blockchain capability. 
According to Armstrong, it reflects Coinbase’s commitment to making crypto transactions as efficient and cost-effective as possible.

“Base has helped dramatically reduce transaction fees and confirmation times, getting us closer to our goal of having the average crypto transaction take less than one second and cost less than $0.01 anywhere in the world. Developer activity on it increased eightfold in Q1. In the last 30 days, Base has processed over two times as many transactions as the entire Ethereum network on Layer 1. Base is now the No. 1 Layer 2 solution by number of transactions processed, a huge accomplishment,” Armstrong said.

While numerous DeFi initiatives have launched on Base, the native projects on this platform have captured a substantial market share. 

For instance, Aerodrome, the top decentralized exchange (DEX) in its ecosystem regarding total value locked (TVL), has recently matched Uniswap in fee generation. This is particularly significant given that Uniswap operates across 16 different chains.
Moreover, Friend.Tech, a decentralized social media platform on Base, airdropped its native token, FRIEND, on Friday in conjunction with V2. The launch and airdrop are speculated to boost the Base ecosystem’s presence significantly.

The advancements in Base have led to an approximate 80% reduction in transaction fees, thanks to various protocol upgrades. Alongside these cost reductions, Armstrong announced the integration of the US Dollar Coin (USDC) across all Coinbase products.

Solana (SOL) Is Battling for Comeback, Bitcoin Is Ready for $60,000 Again, Dogecoin (DOGE) Profitable for 80% of Holders

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



Solana has been displaying a spirited attempt to reclaim its previous highs after a challenging period. The asset recently approached the $140 price level, and technical indicators suggest that a reversal may be on the horizon.Currently, Solana is testing the 100-day EMA, which coincides closely with the $140 level. This is a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency, as the 100 EMA often acts as a significant barometer for bullish or bearish trends. The increasing trading volume accompanying this price action adds a surprising twist to the narrative. Typically, a rise in volume alongside a test of key moving averages indicates strong potential for a breakout.Solana/USDT Chart by TradingViewIf Solana successfully breaches the 100 EMA, the next significant resistance lies around the $150 price point. Overcoming this barrier could confirm the start of a more sustained rally. The increase in volume supports the hypothesis of a breakout, hinting at growing investor interest and potential accumulation at these levels.On the support side, Solana finds a robust base around $115, as indicated by previous price reactions in this region. A strong bounce from this support could further solidify the base for its upward trajectory. However, if this level fails to hold, Solana might face downward pressure, testing lower support levels, possibly around the $100 mark.A successful climb above the 100 EMA could pave the way for a rally toward $150 and potentially higher, marking a significant recovery phase for Solana.  Bitcoin hits crucial levelBitcoin is once again nearing the critical threshold of $60,000, showcasing its potential for another significant rally. Currently, the cryptocurrency is hovering around the 100-day EMA, positioned at approximately $59,000.  Despite the proximity to this key level, the current market tempo indicates a cautious approach among investors. The trading volume and price movements suggest a slower climb than anticipated, which could impact Bitcoin's ability to smoothly surpass the $60,000 mark. The immediate resistance after $60,000 is observed around the $63,500 mark, which Bitcoin approached but did not conclusively breach in recent trading sessions. If Bitcoin manages to sustain momentum and break through the $60,000 resistance, this would likely set the stage for a test of higher resistances near $66,000.On the downside, support levels are distinctly visible. The most immediate robust support lies at $52,100, a level that has historically held up well against bearish downturns. Should Bitcoin experience a pullback, maintaining above this support would be crucial for sustaining bullish sentiment on the market.Dogecoin's impressive performanceDogecoin's market shows a significant concentration of holdings, with 63% of Dogecoin's total supply held by large holders apart from the 80% profitability of the asset. This concentration can lead to increased price volatility as decisions by a few can significantly impact the market's price. Additionally, the holder composition by time held reveals that a majority, 65%, have held their tokens for over a year, indicating strong loyalty or long-term speculation among holders.The overall market signals for Dogecoin are mostly bearish, with on-chain signals indicating slight bearish sentiment due to a minor decrease in the money metric and large transactions. This could suggest a cautious approach by investors in response to recent price movements or broader market conditions. Exchange data reveals $278.73 million in outflows, which might indicate that some investors are moving their holdings off exchanges, possibly to private wallets for long-term holding or in response to market uncertainty.Looking at the Dogecoin price chart, it is currently testing a crucial support level around $0.12 which is represented by the 200 EMA. If this level holds, it could prevent further declines; however, if it breaks, Dogecoin could see lower lows. On the upside, resistance lies near $0.15334, and a break above this could signal a potential recovery.

OpenAI Could Challenge Google and Perplexity With AI-Powered Search: Reports - Decrypt

Already top of mind in the red-hot artificial intelligence space, OpenAI could be working on an AI-powered search engine to challenge tech titan Google, as well as the web-savvy AI tool Perplexity.The tantalizing face-off over the future of finding information online is emerging from rumors and purported insider leaks. The first hints surfaced in February, when The Information reported that OpenAI was developing a search app aimed at Google's core competency.If true, it would be a marked departure from the company's current arrangement with Microsoft to use Bing to give ChatGPT access to the web. Bing uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve answers by folding data from web searches into GPT-4 chatbot responses—giving it an edge in terms of currency of information.More recently, a well-known leaker in the AI space who goes by the pseudonym Jimmy Apples asserted that OpenAI could announce a new search engine soon. Citing a flurry of new domain name records emanating from chatgpt.com, he posited that the Mountain View, Calif.-based firm is preparing to host an event to showcase this new capability."10am, 9th of May for an OpenAI event apparently, might not be model release but search engine announcement,” he tweeted. “Guess they can’t help themselves to upstage Google I/O"—the annual developers conference scheduled to kick off on Tuesday.Ashutosh Shrivastava—another Twitter user who is active in the AI community—delved further, claiming that OpenAI had been very active with a new subdomain named search.chatgpt.com."OpenAI's recent SSL certificate logs revealed something interesting: the domain (search-dot-chatgpt-dot-com) may indicate that OpenAI is developing a search functionality. " he said.A standard WHOIS domain registry search confirms that the subdomain exists, but attempts to access it fail.Jimmy Apples also said OpenAI may be testing more features or AI models."I count at least 50+ new async subdomains since the 24th of April," he tweeted, speculating that a new ChatGPT search engine might offer faster responses than its main chatbot and feature strong summarization capabilities.Web search and AIUntil the explosive debut of consumer-ready AI tools like ChatGPT, Google was the king of search, providing the main way people found information online. But its central position is being challenged as users become more comfortable asking a chatbot for answers than conducting a Google search.For some, the shift can't come soon enough, as Google search results are increasingly crowded with paid placement and sites that exist only to draw search traffic.On the other hand, the currency and completeness of information provided by AI models is often a weakness of chatbots—as well as devices intended to make the smartphone obsolete. Two high-profile AI gadget releases in the past month—the Humane AI pin and the Rabbit R1—have laid bare the limitations of this much-hyped approach to ubiquitous computing.Some companies are already combining AI and search. Perplexity is an AI-powered search engine that has built up a reputation in the AI space and drawn major investments from Nvidia and Jeff Bezos. Recently, Microsoft —which is OpenAI’s leading investor—banned employees from using Perplexity for security reasons. And while its reach is miniscule compared to tools from OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, Perplexity is seeing historic levels of interest right now, according to Google Trends.Image: Google TrendsIf OpenAI develops a native GPT-powered search engine, it would go head to head with Google Search, which has essentially owned this critical facet of the internet since it's launch in 1998. It will also immediately dwarf Perplexity's leadership in the more niche area of AI-powered search engines.Marketing platform Semrush estimates that there are 5.9 million Google searches conducted each minute, adding up to 8.5 billion searches per day or 3.1 trillion searches per year. Only 17 months old, ChatGPT currently has about 1.6 billion visits per month, while Perplexity is used by 10 million people every month.In a recent podcast with Lex Fridman, OpenAI chief, Sam Altman hinted at OpenAI's interest in reinventing web search.“The intersection of LLMs plus search, I don’t think anyone has cracked the code on yet,” he said. “I would love to go do that. I think that would be cool.”As of now, there has been no official announcement from OpenAI regarding the development of a search engine, and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comments from Decrypt. But based on its founders enthusiasm for the space, a new AI search engine seems more likely than not.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Crypto Whales Snatch Up $2.9 Billion in Bitcoin in Single-Day Frenzy | Cryptoglobe


                                
Large cryptocurrency holders, colloquially known as whales, have accumulated nearly 47,000 Bitcoins in the past day worth around $2.9 billion, according to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant.



The data, shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) by the company’s founder and CEO Ki Young Ju, shows the balances of cryptocurrency whales last active over the past 24-hour period surged exponentially, with the CEO saying “we’re entering a new era” as a result.







The whale accumulation came after a recent price dip that saw Bitcoin’s pricep lunge from over $60,000 to a low just below the $57,000 mark before it quickly started recovering, with the cryptocurrency having surged more than 4.5% over the last 24 hours to now trade at $61,700.



As CryptoGlobe reported some institutions may be among those buying the dip, as BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe whose asset management arm has over $600 billion in assets under management, has gained exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin via a spot exchange-traded fund.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

According to a recent 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the bank has purchased shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), as first reported by Bitcoin Magazine.



Large institutional investors managing over $100 million in assets have to, every quarter, disclose their holdings via 13F filings and after the successful launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., these filings have been closely watched by industry sleuths.



Notably, an executive at BlackRock has revealed sovereign wealth funds are showing interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF, and could start trading it over the next few months.



Such an investment would show a significantly different attitude towards digital assets. Foreign wealth funds like Kuwait’s Invstment Authority (KIA), the oldest sovereign wealth fund in the world, and Norway’s well-known $1.6 trillion wealth fund, could make ripples in the market with even conservative allocations.

Fantom Revival: Crypto Analyst Predicts A Jump To $1.2 For FTM Price


                            Fantom (FTM) had initially reclaimed the $1 level back in March and expectations were that the coin would rise to $2. But that was before the market crash sent prices spiraling, and Fantom lost almost 50% of its value during this time. However, all hope is not lost of for the coin, as one crypto analyst expects a return of the bullish momentum as long as certain conditions are met.
Fantom Searching For Support
Crypto analyst MyCryptoParadise took to TradingView to share their analysis on the Fantom price and how it could see a recovery. After the price fell to $0.56, the altcoin began to look for support, which would serve as a bounce-off point, and the analyst revealed that the altcoin is actually getting closer to this support.

For now, the support lies at $0.5679, which is the point that bulls need to hold to confirm a bullish breakout. Following a rejection at the $0.79 resistance, this point has become even more important to hold, as the FTM price searches for “renewed momentum.”
“Should FTM successfully find support and bounce from this level, it could potentially form a double bottom pattern, with the neckline acting as resistance around the 0.798 mark,” the crypto analyst said, highlighting the importance of finding support.
In the event of a breakout, the analyst expects at least a 100% move from here. The first major level to break it the $1 level, and then after that, the crypto analyst sees the price going as high as $1.2 as long as the trend is confirmed.

FTM Could Break Down Further
On the flip side of this, the crypto analyst also identifies a scenario where the Fantom price could continue to break down. In the event that the altcoin is unable to find support above $0.56 and breaks through it instead, the bloodbath could continue.

The bearish continuation which the analyst sees in a situation like this will send the price below $0.5 eventually. The support for the FTM price then lies at the next Bullish OB area, which the crypto analyst identifies to be around $0.449.
“💎 Reclaiming the support at 0.568 would be crucial for FTM to maintain its bullish momentum,” the analyst said. “Should FTM fail to bounce even after reaching the Bullish OB area, it would signal a bullish invalidation, indicating a continuation of the bearish trend.”
Presently, the Fantom price is trending above support at $0.6641. However, it is down 3% in the last day with 10% losses in the last week.

Dogecoin's $1 billion loss means its $0.15 price target is... - AMBCrypto



DOGE’s price might slip below $0.13 since liquidity in the derivatives dropped
Fewer coins moved over the week, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s run has taken a break

According to Coinglass, since 1 April, Dogecoin’s [DOGE] Open Interest has fallen from $2.11 billion to $780 million. Here, Open Interest (OI) is the value of open positions in a contract. The metric increases or decreases based on net positioning.
If the OI increases, it means new money is coming into the market and buyers are aggressive.
A lot of money leaves DOGE
However, the OI decline for Dogecoin implies that contracts worth over $1 billion were closed in a little over 30 days. From a trading perspective, this means that sellers have been aggressive while most traders took liquidity out.
This inefficiency has also affected DOGE’s price. According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE was valued at $0.13 at press time. This figure alluded to a 28.11% price fall in the last 30 days alone.
Source: Coinglass
While the memecoin’s price appreciated over the last 24 hours, in light of the OI decline, it does not seem that the aggressive downside would stop soon. If this is the case, DOGE might either hold on to $0.13 or a decline to $0.11 could be next.
Furthermore, the broader market shares a similar sentiment too. AMBCrypto noticed this after evaluating the Weighted Sentiment.
According to data from Santiment, Dogecoin’s Weighted Sentiment was -0.411. This reading implies that market participants do not expect a short-term recovery for DOGE.
Besides this, we considered the Funding Rate. Funding Rate is the cost of holding an open perp position. If funding is positive, it means longs are paying shorts a fee.
No way to $0.15 now
A negative reading implies that shorts are paying longs. At press time, DOGE’s Funding Rate was positive but moving lower. As the price moves higher and funding drops, perp buyers might be in disbelief.
With little to no aggression from longs, DOGE’s price might evade flipping the overhead resistance. Therefore, an upswing past $0.15 might be impossible within the next few days.
Source: Santiment
Furthermore, activity has started to rise again on Dogecoin’s network. On 25 April, the number of active addresses on the network was less than 50,000.
Active addresses show the number of wallets interacting with a project. At press time, that number had increased to 67,200— Meaning that users are back to making a lot of transactions on the network.
However, this metric was nowhere near the levels seen when DOGE changed hands at $0.20. If the metric stays at this level, DOGE’s price might hike, but it is almost certain that the uptrend will not last.

Additionally, the one-day circulation was 2.54 billion, indicating that Dogecoin’s usage fell on the charts. Ergo, as long as fewer coins are moved, DOGE might remain stuck within a tight range.

Nigeria poised to outlaw P2P crypto trading over national security concerns

Nigeria’s National Security Adviser (NSA) is set to label crypto trading as a national security threat, signaling an impending crackdown on peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto transactions, according to local media reports and CryptoSlate sources.The move follows the decision of at least three major Nigerian fintech startups — Moniepoint, Paga, and Palmpay — to block accounts involved in crypto dealings and report such activities to law enforcement.According to Moniepoint CEO Tosin Eniolorunda, the NSA’s classification is expected to pave the way for new regulations banning P2P crypto trading, with an official announcement anticipated soon.This represents a notable shift in regulatory stance, particularly after the Bola Tinubu administration had previously shown a more lenient attitude toward crypto. In fact, in December 2023, the Central Bank of Nigeria lifted a two-year ban on crypto transactions, hinting at a more welcoming regulatory environment.However, recent months have seen a reversal in this trend, with authorities blaming crypto speculators for exacerbating the volatility of the foreign exchange (FX) market. The proposed ban on P2P trading is based on the Central Bank’s assertion that crypto traders exploit this method to manipulate the Nigerian naira through pump-and-dump schemes.Central Bank Governor Olayemi Cardoso alleged in February 2024 that Binance had facilitated $26 billion in untraceable transactions, leading to a crackdown on the exchange and the freezing of over 1,000 bank accounts linked to P2P transactions.In a related development, four prominent fintech firms were recently directed to halt the opening of new customer accounts, though the source of this directive remains unclear.Moniepoint’s CEO, Tosin Eniolorunda, confirmed that the move was at the behest of the NSA, who expressed concerns over the ease with which fintech platforms facilitate account openings, particularly Tier 3 accounts.While a spokesperson for the NSA declined to provide further details, this development highlights the increasing scrutiny over the rapid proliferation of accounts facilitated by fintech startups. Traditional banks have long raised concerns that such accounts serve as conduits for illicit funds.Responding to these concerns, the Central Bank amended its rules in December 2023, mandating fintech startups to verify the identities of all account holders by March 2024.As Nigeria braces for further regulatory measures in the crypto space, the fate of P2P trading remains uncertain amid mounting national security concerns and evolving regulatory landscapes.

                        Friend.tech native token $FRIEND fell 50% on May 3 after its debut as the largest whale dumped their holdings. Meanwhile, users couldn’t access their airdropped tokens.As BaseScan data shows, within hours of the airdrop, the largest holder, “Murphys1d,” sold over 55,000 of the newly issued $FRIEND.This led to an immediate 53.3% drop in the token’s price from $3.26 to $1.30 as of writing. Friend.tech Community Unable to Access Airdrop 
Beyond the sell-off, some users were unable to claim their airdrop, forcing them to watch helplessly as $FRIEND’s price plummeted. Crypto investor Luke Martin commented that this just “adds insult to injury.”This issue is much at fault for liquidity issues – the market’s inability to absorb large buy and sell orders at stable prices.In a low liquidity environment, a few large orders can have an outsized impact on the market price.$FRIEND only had $0.01 worth of liquidity, leaving holders vulnerable. The extremely low liquidity evoked outrage within the community.“First you milk your users with fees, then you get them to add liquidity so that they can dump on each other,” disgruntled X user mcSleuth commented.Airdrop Farmers Continue to Plague Token Launches
Friend.tech dump is just one example of a professional airdrop farmer. These “squatters” interact with emerging protocols solely for the airdrop rewards, often with multiple wallets to compound rewards.This comes at a heavy cost to the communities surrounding the protocols squatters target. Dumps create major selling pressure, causing legitimate protocol users to panic and sell their holdings. In April 2024, Omni Network was similarly affected by Sybil farmers. Their native OMNI token fell 55% in less than 18 hours following its airdrop, losing over half of its market capitalization. While these events can have a huge negative impact on price action, it is only often short-term. $FRIEND may struggle following this event, but its community of investors may pull it through in the long term.

5 Solana Memecoins That Could Skyrocket Over 9,000% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Web3 gaming reception shifts from skepticism to enthusiasm: Shrapnelâs Head of Studio - Crypto Briefing




Blockchain gaming is received with excitement by 46% of traditional PC gamers, according to a survey by Web3 PC games distribution platform Ultra. This signs a possible shift in how traditional gamers perceive the blockchain gaming industry, something that Don Norbury, Head of Studio at Shrapnel, discussed with Crypto Briefing.Norbury said that during this year’s edition of the Game Developers Conference (GDC), he could witness this shift in the gaming community after attending the event for the third time as a Shrapnel team member, adding that he uses GDC “as a measuring stick for sentiment in the game development community,” as gamers’ sentiment don’t always line up.“I would say three years ago, which was really when we just started the idea of Shrapnel, it was kind of curiosity, like stifled curiosity about just this blockchain thing. And people [developers] weren’t contrary to consumer sentiment, they weren’t outright hostile,” shared Norbury.A good thermometer of how the traditional gaming community didn’t have an appreciation for this industry is the famous post by Linkin Park member Mike Shinoda about the matter in January 2022. Back then, gamers flooded the publication’s commentary area rejecting the idea of having crypto or non-fungible tokens in their games.This sentiment started changing when blockchain games showed their value to the gaming industry and people started asking themselves “why wasn’t it always the way to do things?” stated Norbury.“I would say that [the shift happened] a year ago, when we came up with an MVP that was called MPX, a multiplayer experiment, and we did a behind-closed-doors demo where we invited people all week long and it was massively oversubscribed. And at that time, the people that we were talking to had moved to conversations about how are we going to solve these problems that are very much typical game dev problems, which are like, ‘how are you gonna prevent cheating?’,” explained Shrapnel’s Head of Studio.Moreover, creators of mainstream games, such as multiplayer first-person shooter Valorant, started discussing more aspects of gaming. “Like ‘nerding out’ game dev attitude, as opposed to asking questions about like what blockchain was or what token economies were.”In this year’s edition, Norbury joked that Shrapnel’s team “almost needed a lot of bouncers,” because the interest from attendees in the game was higher than ever.“Everybody wanted to talk to us about how we were doing what we were doing, how they could get into it, how to avoid certain pitfalls, how do we structure, foundations in our company. I couldn’t go three feet without somebody wanting to engage and learn more.”Different from previous editions, gamers could see in this year’s GDC how fun and full of energy Web3 gamers are through Shrapnel, added Norbury.From Web2 to Web3Don Norbury and most of Shrapnel’s team have an extensive ‘Web2 gaming’ background, working on well-known titles such as Bioshock Infinite. He told Crypto Briefing that the main difference between these gaming universes is that Web3 is very much about ownership, affordance, transportability, and interoperability.“These are the reasons we’re even building our technical infrastructure the way that we are so that everything in Shrapnel from the get-go can go to any chain and any platform. It’s all built that way natively,” added Norbury.Furthermore, since Web3 is about giving ownership of assets to the players, it demands a special and constant awareness of open market economics. “Now you have to think of something having a limited supply, right? Having reinforced scarcity. You don’t always have to do that, but you need to be aware of what the repercussions are.”Web3 and esports togetherEsports, the competitive sector of the games industry, is an important part of this ecosystem nowadays, projected by Statista to reach $4.3 billion in revenue this year. One of the latest developments connecting esports and gaming is the $120 million investment made by Saudi Arabia to boost both sectors in the country.Norbury believes that a competitive landscape created on Web3 gaming is relevant, and could provide a “much-needed catalyst” for its success. Although highlighting parts of esports that need solving, such as quick seasons, the life cycle of teams and gamers, and mimicking some of the wrong aspects of traditional sports, he shares that esports and gaming are “a natural marriage.”“It’s not just a business model problem. I think there’s an ongoing fandom, people’s interests, and willingness to pay money to go to an event or watch something. […] I think that Web3, and we’re taking this approach from an e-sports perspective, offers a unique avenue to allow more grassroots esports as opposed to these giant LAN events or giant like the Overwatch League where you had to pay millions and millions of dollars right out of the gate just to have your org be part of it.”Moreover, Norbury highlights the gaming guilds in Web3, which he describes as “networks of humans that are already together and have similar interests with different specialties.”“Some of them are players, some of them are promoters. Some people are just like all about the financing side of it, right? But you look at it and if you squint, they kind of have the same shape as what you would expect a tournament promoter or an organization to have.”Therefore, the relationship between Web3 gaming and esports has a bi-directional value from Norbury’s perspective, where the structure of both industries boost each other.“It’s not just this one thing from a business perspective that they [Web3 gaming guilds] are trying to do. It’s almost like a brand thing, a marketing thing, a social thing. And I think that’s the shape within Web3 that’ll ultimately succeed the most,” he concludes.

Is Internet Computer Going to Zero? ICP Price Drops 2.3%, Investors Rush Into This New GambleFi Token / Source: Cryptonews
                        Investors are concerned that promising cryptocurrency Internet Computer (ICP) could be headed to zero, with its rally since late 2024 looking at risk of petering out and are instead turning to a promising new GambleFi token called Mega Dice (DICE).ICP was last changing hands at $13.64 and is attempting to push back above its 21DMA.The cryptocurrency has been probing an uptrend that has been in play since late 2023.Should this uptrend snap, a quick fall back to $10 is on the cards.With ICP is at risk of breaking lower towards $10, investors are checking out this exciting new GambleFi token. Source: TradingViewInternet Computer is a decentralized blockchain network that is attempting to realize the vision of a functional global computing network.Despite launching back in May 2021, ICP has failed to garner much by way of real-world adoption.The blockchain last had only around $95 million in cryptocurrency locked in smart contracts, as per DeFi Llama.That a paltry amount compared to Ethereum, which has $134 billion.It’s no surprise then that some investors fear that ICP will never gain real-world traction and will go to zero.That’s a risky bet to make. ICP is a highly speculative coin, which remains subject to abrupt rallies as risk appetite picks up.But ICP may never make it back to its 2021 highs near $350.With ICP at risk of dropping back below $10, it’s no wonder that investors are checking out this new GambleFi token called Mega Dice (DICE).ICP Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice (DICE)
Crypto investors looking for investments with greater upside potential than ICP should check out presale investing.Web3 projects and protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to raise funds for development.If presale investors can find a good project that gains traction in the market, they can book exponential gains.One project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is Mega Dice Casino.This already well-established crypto casino has launched a presale of its utility token DICE.DICE holders get big cashback benefits on their wagers and can also generate passive income via DICE staking.The crypto casino is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors.The project has already raised $700,000. And potential investors better move quickly, as when the $1 million milestone is hit, the DICE price will rise.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presale

                        OpenAI’s ChatGPT’s absence in China has created a unique opportunity for a new wave of artificial intelligence startups in China, each vying to fill the void and establish themselves as leaders in the generative AI space.Backed by major regional investors, these startups are developing advanced AI systems capable of producing various content, from images and text to music, posing a major challenge to OpenAI’s global supremacy.Chinese Startups Challenging the Reign of OpenAI
Four key startups have become leaders in China’s AI sector, each achieving unicorn status with valuations exceeding $1 billion. Zhipu AI, backed by giants like Alibaba Cloud and Tencent, is leading with a valuation of $2.5 billion. They focus on providing comprehensive AI solutions and have amassed a team of 800 employees.Moonshot AI, also valued at $2.5 billion, targets students and office workers with its text summarization technology. Their AI chatbot, Kimi, experienced explosive growth, with over 12 million visits in March alone.OpenAI Alternatives
MiniMax, based in Shanghai, takes a unique approach, employing anime-themed characters to engage the gaming market. Their interactive avatars, valued at $2.5 billion, can generate responses, jokes, and even flirt with users. Meanwhile, 01.ai, with a valuation of $1.2 billion, focuses on open-source models tailored for the Chinese market, such as the productivity-focused Wanzhi.“There is no winner of foundation models yet in the China market. These are some of the names leading the charge to claim that title,” Charlie Dai, Vice President and principal analyst at tech-focused consultancy Forrester, told the Financial Times.This diverse range of approaches demonstrates China’s AI startups’ adaptability as they compete with OpenAI.With approximately 262 AI-focused startups offering ChatGPT alternatives to the Chinese market, the race for AI dominance is heating up. As these Chinese startups continue to advance and grow, they can reshape the future of generative AI, challenging OpenAI’s position and offering new possibilities for the industry.

DOJ charges former Cred execs over $783M fraud and money laundering scheme - Crypto Briefing




The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced charges against three former executives of the now-bankrupt crypto lending and investing firm Cred, alleging their involvement in a scheme that led to customers losing crypto holdings currently valued at over $783 million.The accused individuals include Cred co-owner and former CEO Daniel Schatt, former CFO Joseph Podulka, and former CCO James Alexander. IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Mark Mosley described the defendants’ alleged activities at Cred as a “predatory, deceptive scheme.”According to the indictments, the executives made numerous false statements starting no later than March 2020, claiming that Cred only engaged in collateralized and guaranteed lending, utilized hedged crypto investments, and had all-weather protection against volatility. Marketing materials also allegedly falsely advertised Cred as a licensed lender with comprehensive insurance.“The indictments levied demonstrate the investigative capabilities of IRS Criminal Investigation and our commitment to pursuing justice against financial criminals,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Mark Mosley.Even after a 2020 flash crash, the executives allegedly portrayed Cred as solvent and promised that insurance would make customers whole. Despite Cred’s General Counsel admitting potential insolvency, the executives allegedly sought new customer funds instead of disclosing the firm’s true financial situation.The executives also allegedly failed to disclose that nearly all customer yields were generated by a single company making micro-loans to Chinese gamers.A federal grand jury charged each of the three individuals with varying counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering, with combined maximum sentences amounting to decades in prison and millions of dollars in fines.Schatt and Podulka made their first court appearance on May 2 and are scheduled to return on May 8, while Alexander’s initial appearance is pending. The case is proceeding in the Northern District of California.“This prosecution demonstrates our determination to keep our markets free of fraudsters and safe for investors,” said U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey.The DOJ’s announcement comes amid a series of recent cases targeting individuals in the cryptocurrency industry, including charges against Bitcoin proponent Roger Ver for alleged tax evasion and against the founders of the privacy-enabled crypto wallet Samourai Wallet.At the time of Cred’s bankruptcy filing on November 7, 2020, customers had suffered losses of cryptocurrency assets with a market value of $150 million, which has since risen to a potential maximum market value of over $783 million.

Memecoins Resurgence? POPCAT And MEW Surge 20%


                            As the crypto market settles in on this new phase of the crypto cycle, some memecoins have shown remarkable performance over the last couple of days.
Cat-theme tokens have significantly grown in popularity during this bull run, with some, like Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW), making it to the top 10 memecoins list. Other feline-inspired tokens like Popcat (POPCAT) and Wen (WEN) have had a stellar week after recent partnerships that caused the price to surge by 20% overnight.

Was The Memecoin Surge Fueled By Bitcoin?
The memecoins sector has been dominated by dogs, with tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) being the flagship memecoins for the last few years. During this bull cycle, dog-themed tokens like Bonk (BONK) and dogwifhat (WIF) have been the talk of the town, and some of the tokens with the strongest performance.
Since its launch in January 2023, Bonk has surged around 4291%, while WIF has soared about 1512% since December 2023. Moreover, the sector has shown stellar performances with cryptocurrencies like PEPE and Book of Meme (BOME).
Bitcoin (BTC) has dominated this cycle alongside memecoins, as highlighted by top crypto analysts like Alex Krüger and Altcoin Sherpa. However, their performance has been strongly co-related to BTC’s in most cases.


The rest of the market has gone down with Bitcoin whenever the flagship cryptocurrency faces a strong retrace. Consequentially, when BTC has recovered, most sectors, including memecoins, have regained their levels. It’s worth noting that some tokens like Popcat have continued to perform well, even during the recent rally slowdowns.
On Thursday, Bitcoin successfully tested the $59,000 resistance level after spending most of May’s first days hovering between $57,000-$58,000. In the last hours of the day, the largest cryptocurrency seemingly turned the resistance level into a support zone, pumping the price of several memecoins.
As a result, the memecoin market was 9.46% up on Thursday night. Similarly, cat-themed tokens were up by 22.09% with a market capitalization of $1.581 billion, per CoinMarketCap data.
Cat-Themed Memecoins Take The Lead With Popcat
Despite dominating the memecoins market, canine-inspired tokens have lost some ground against the increasing popularity of feline-inspired ones. While the cats’ tokens had increased over 20% in the previous 24 hours, the dogs’ sector only surged 3.7% in the same timeframe.
Over the last few days, cat-themed memecoins have been among the top gainers in the crypto market. For instance, Popcat has remarkably maintained its upward trajectory during the recent retrace and also joined the top 10 memecoins list.
Popcat, which seems to be building a loyal community, has continuously shown double-digit gain percentages this week. As reported by SolanaFloor, the token momentarily flippled BOME with its $570.3 million market capitalization.
Moreover, as Bitcoin reclaimed the $59,000 level, the cat-themed token saw a 31% price increase in the daily timeframe. This made Popcat the largest gainer among the top ten memecoins.
According to memecoin analyst Murad, Popcat will surge to $5-10 in the short-term as “the Crowned Top Cat.” As the token reached its all-time high (ATH) of $0.618 on Thursday, the trader highlighted several targets, including a long-term $20 scenario.

Murad's prediction for POPCAT. Source: X
Murad expects the token “to go to $1 quickly” next time it closes above $0.63. Per the analysts, “It’s Cat Season baby and $POPCAT is in control.”
MEW Remains A Popular Cat
A month ago, MEW joined the dogs’ pack after becoming the eighth largest memecoin by market capitalization. Since then, the lonely cat’s performance has struggled, with a 51.8% and 28.4% price decrease in the monthly and weekly timeframes.
Despite the recent drop in performance, the token has remained one of the hottest topics among altcoins. On Monday, crypto exchange Bidget crowned MEW as the most searched altcoin on the exchange, beating PEPE and SOL on the “#BidgetTrendingSpot.”
At the time of writing, the token has shown a remarkable 12% price recovery in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $0.00424.

Cardano's latest buy signal - Why it could mean a relief rally for ADA's price - AMBCrypto



ADA could potentially see a relief rally over the next 1-4 days
ADA whales can be seen buying the dip en masse

Cardano [ADA], at the time of writing, showed signs of recovery following a 2% hike over a 24-hour trading period, according to CoinMarketCap. This, after the crypto bled heavily in April, recording losses of more than 23% on the charts.
According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data, the aforementioned market slump narrowed the percentage of ADA’s total supply in profit from 73% towards the beginning of the month to 51% by the time it ended.
Source: Santiment
Rebound incoming?
However, the corrective phase might end soon, going by the predictions of popular on-chain analyst Ali Martinez. On ADA’s daily chart, Martinez spotted a buy signal on the TD Sequential indicator, suggesting a potential relief rally for the next 1-4 days.
To make better sense of the forecast, AMBCrypto examined other key technical indicators of ADA.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) rose steadily in the last 2-3 days, a sign that selling pressure has been easing. That being said, the broader sentiment was still bearish and the RSI needed to rise above 40 to justify the prospect of a sustained rally. A move above neutral-50 would strengthen bullish sentiments.
The buying pressure was also apparent in the rise of On Balance Volume since the beginning of May. At press time, it mirrored ADA’s price action on the charts, raising hopes of a sustained rally.

Assessing whales’ response
Cardano’s downturn in price caught the attention of whale investors. On 30 April, transactions worth more than $100k spiked to their highest levels since November 2023.
On analysis of different whale cohorts, intriguing observations came to light. Smaller whales, with ADA holdings ranging from 1,000 to 1 million, decreased in number, suggesting that they have been selling off.
Larger whales, on the other hand, were accumulating, as addresses holding between 1 million to 100 million coins increased in number. Hence, it was evident that significant capital was flowing from smaller whales to bigger whales.

Former Cred execs face wire fraud and money laundering charges

Three former executives of bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Cred have been charged over allegedly engaging in wire fraud and money laundering prior to the firm declaring bankruptcy in November 2020.“This prosecution demonstrates our determination to keep our markets free of fraudsters and safe for investors,” the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California wrote in a May 3 statement.Former CEO Daniel Schatt and CFO Joseph Podulka face 13 charges of wire fraud and money laundering, while CCO James Alexander is charged with four counts.“It highlights a predatory, deceptive scheme defrauding potential victims of hundreds of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency at market value,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Mark Mosley.The three executives maximum sentence per count, if convicted. Source: United States Attorney's Office for Northern District of CaliforniaWhen Cred declared bankruptcy in November 2020, Cointelegraph reported that numerous users turned to social media to voice their concerns and ask if “their funds are safe.”Prosecutors allege that the three executives were misleading customers about Cred’s lending and investment practices. Cred allegedly claimed to only engage in “collateralized or guaranteed lending,” that Cred’s cryptocurrency investments were “hedged,” and that Cred maintained an “all weather approach” to investment to protect against volatility.However, the prosecutors claimed that Cred engaged in lending that “was neither collateralized nor guaranteed.”Related: Bankrupt crypto lender Genesis seeks approval to sell $1.6B of trust assetsSchatt and Podulka appeared in court for the first time on May 2 and must return to enter a plea on May 8.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank Holding $7,427,000,000,000 Off-Balance Sheet in Potentially Dangerous Cocktail of Unknown Assets: Report - The Daily Hodl


								JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank are keeping trillions of dollars in unknown and potentially risky assets off of their balance sheets, according to new data from the US government.
The new numbers – compiled by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) and first reported on by Wall Street on Parade – show JPMorgan Chase holds $3.227 trillion off-balance sheet, Bank of America holds $1.6 trillion off-balance sheet and Citibank holds $2.6 trillion off-balance sheet.










The Federal Reserve defines off-balance sheet activities as “quite diverse in nature” and says they may include such instruments as firm loan commitments, standby letters of credit, foreign exchange, financial futures, forward contracts, options, interest rate swap contracts and other derivative products.
Off-balance sheet accounting has been a common practice in the banking industry for years and as Wall Street on Parade notes, it played a major role in the 2008 financial crisis.
“More than other banks, Citigroup held assets off of its balance sheet, in part to hold down capital requirements… if those had been included, leverage in 2007 would have been 48:1, or about 53% higher…
Citigroup, of course, blew itself up in 2008 and received the largest bailouts in global banking history. By March of 2009, its stock was trading at 99 cents.”
In July of last year, the Federal Reserve announced a proposal that would impose higher capital requirements on banks to ensure their balance sheets are more resilient in economic downturns.
CEOs at JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon and State Street argued against the proposed changes in a Senate Banking Oversight Committee hearing in December.
In a prepared statement, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the changes would damage the banking industry and the economy at large.
“Despite zero evidence that large U.S. banks are undercapitalized today, the proposed Basel III Endgame rule, if enacted, would unjustifiably and unnecessarily increase capital requirements by 20-25% for the largest banks. 
Banks would be limited in their ability to deploy capital in the times we’re most needed, and the rule will have a harmful ripple effect on the economy, markets, businesses of all sizes and American households.”

How L2s like Optimism, Base, and Arbitrum are shaping up for May - AMBCrypto



Blast recorded explosive month-on-month growth in terms of new addresses
OP’s daily active addresses rose in May, while others saw their numbers fall

Layer 2s have made quite a buzz over the last few months because of their high network activity. As the first month of Q2 came to an end, Coin98 Analytics shared a monthly report highlighting the states of multiple top L2s, including Optimism [OP], Arbitrum [ARB], zkSync Era, and Base. 
L2s’ state in April 
Coin98 Analytics’ report revealed that OP dominated others in terms of total addresses, as its value stood at 138 million. Base and ARB trailed behind, with values of 71.9 million and 22.3 million, respectively. 
Moreover, OP also hit an all-time high on certain days this month, with over 450k new addresses per day. In April, Optimism recorded the highest number of new addresses created. Though OP’s numbers were the highest, Base and ARB also saw significant growth in April.

While the aforementioned L2s’ performance was commendable, Blast took the limelight because of its explosive growth. Coin98 found that Blast’s number of addresses grew by a whopping 42% in April, while OP, Base, and ARB’s growth rates were 2%, 4%, and 12%, respectively. 
The report additionally looked at L2s’ transactions in April. opBNB nabbed the first spot with over 872 million transactions. ARB, zkSync, and OP followed behind as their total transactions stood at 472 million, 346 million, and 257 million, respectively. 
Interestingly, Blast noted the highest growth rate in terms of transactions as well, with a hike of 112% month-on-month. 
Also, the top 4 Layer 2 protocols with the largest TVLs have seen significant shifts in money flows, with ARB sitting on top. Base recorded a 24% MoM hike with figures of over $284 million. On the contrary, Arbitrum registered a decline of over $371 million in TVL.

How is May looking?
Since the month of April was pretty active for L2s, AMBCrypto then checked the latest data to find out how these aforementioned L2s have done so far in May. However, our analysis of Artemis’ data revealed that ARB, Base, and zkSync’s daily active addresses have started to fall.
Optimism acted differently as its active addresses rose. While Base and zkSync’s daily transactions declined, Base and OP’s numbers moved up slightly.

As far as captured value is concerned, Base had the highest revenue when May began, followed by OP. The declining trend was also true in this regard, as Base and zkSync’s graphs started to decline. 
On the other hand, ARB and OP’s revenue gained upward momentum in May. 
In light of these metrics, it seems likely that OP and ARB might see promising growth in May while Base and zkSync face some trouble.

MakerDAO announces launch of two new tokens | Cryptopolitan

MakerDAO has announced that it will launch two new tokens. The two tokens were announced in March and named NewStable and NewGovToken. These two tokens are intended for the broader participation of users in governance activities.  MakerDAO and announcement of new tokensMakerDAO is a global financial system that claims to have brought the first unbiased currency DAI. The mentioned currency is one of the leading stablecoins that is overcollateralized. Furthermore, the mentioned ecosystem is known for its decentralized governance adding to its value. Though there was a great controversy regarding algorithmic stablecoins MakerDAO’s DAI was able to steer clear.MakerDAO stablecoin is stabilized through cryptocurrencies as well as stablecoins like USDC. This protocol was launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain and its stablecoin is pegged to the US dollar. The protocol works by allowing loans in DAI while they have to use other cryptocurrencies as collateral.If a user wants to get a $100,000 DAI, they would have to collateralize $170,000 worth of ETH, thus providing it protection against potential problems. According to available information, DAI has been backed by the worth of about $10.6 billion assets in crypto while assets in the real world amount to $100 million.   In a big leap, MakerDAO has announced that it will launch two new tokens to further improve its governance model. The two tokens have been named NewStable and NewGOV. These two will be introduced to the ecosystem after the upcoming brand reveal. NewStable and NewGOVNewStable is an upgraded version of Dai which has been enhanced for broader adoption and improved stability. According to the official statement on X, the official name of NewStable will be unveiled in the upcoming brand reveal. The NewGOV token has been designed to improve the governance approach in the ecosystem. It has been designed in order to ensure that more users participate in the governance and the decision-making becomes robust. The process of the conversion of the tokens is simple where the users can upgrade to NewStable from Dai while they have an option to revert. In the case of NewGOV, 1 MKR can be converted to 24,000 NGT. The redenomination has been announced in order to improve the participation of users in governance. Furthermore, the statement has clarified that the two tokens will not replace DAI and MKR, rather they represent an expansion. The users will have the option to transition to the newly announced tokens.As per available information, NST holders can engage in the farming of NGT. 600 million NGT will be available on an annual basis to the participating NST holders. Farming won’t be available to US users while those accessing the services on VPN won’t be able to farm. According to the official sources, the strategic supply of NewGOV tokens has been redenominated in comparison to MKR.  What’s next?Those who participate in the farming or conversion to the new tokens will be able to utilize a range of benefits. These include access to new features and opportunities. Those who transition to the latest tokens will be able to gain access to the latest functions in the ecosystem. There is flexibility and choice as the new tokens are introduced, thus the users will be able to choose between the available options. These tokens are a gateway to future products and services and will provide entry to the evolving ecosystem. Interested users can stay connected to the Maker Ecosystem to get new updates. ConclusionMakerDAO has announced the launch of two new tokens, which have been codenamed NewStable and NewGOV. The two tokens will be officially revealed in the upcoming brand reveal event. The two tokens are aimed at bringing ease and facilitation to the users.

BTC-e operator has pleaded guilty to money laundering | Cryptopolitan

The US Department of Justice has continued to hunt those who have been involved in the criminal use of crypto. In a recent development, it announced that it had held a Russian national for his involvement with BTC-e. The mentioned person had been found involved in the use of crypto exchange for money laundering and has pleaded guilty. BTC-e and its operationsBTC-e was a cryptocurrency trading platform that had been in operation from 2011 to 2017. Its servers were based in the US while it served Russian nationals. The US government found out about the servers and other details in 2017 and seized its funds as well as the website. It was founded by Alexander Vinnik and Aleksandr Bilyuchenko.  The website held a considerable amount of Bitcoin exchange volume, amounting to about 3%. Later it was taken over by someone else and it was used for the financing of war in Donbass. The mentioned website was charged with money laundering in 2017 and the significant event was alleged involvement in the money laundering of the funds of Mt. Gox. In order to repay its customers, BTC-e created WEX tokens which were later presented as proof at court. These tokens presented a value of $1 and were issued to customer accounts to present the value of customers’ investments.Money laundering and BTC-e involvementOne of the leading persons behind the BTC-e was Alexander Vinnik who operated the mentioned cryptocurrency exchange. As the allegations of money laundering and other activities surrounding the mentioned website grew, Vinnik was arrested. Vinnik had worked as an operator of BTC-e from 2011 to 2017 and had processed a considerably big chunk of transactions. The number of processed transactions was about 1 million while the amount processed using these transactions in crypto amounted to $9 billion. The mentioned person was arrested in Greece in 2017 and it took a long process to extradite him to the US. Vinnik had initially denied that he was an operator at BTC-e, rather he claimed to have been only an employee. BTC-e hadn’t been registered as a money business service in the US. In addition to that, it hadn’t any KYC policy nor had it any rules to collect customer data to prevent money laundering. According to the press release from the US DoJ, the mentioned website received funds from different criminal activities. These activities included hacks, ransomware attacks, and other scams. Though France, Russia, and the US tried to ensure that Vinnik was extradited to their respective states, the US was able to make it. The US DoJ has said that this case shows their commitment to prevention and combating crypto crime. Furthermore, the guilty plea shows that DoJ has used all available resources and tools to fight money laundering. Transactions and losses caused by BTC-eAs said above, BTC-e processed transactions worth more than $9 billion from 2011 to 2017, which has caused huge losses. The number of transactions shows the huge number of crime perpetrators who have been involved in money laundering.  According to the press statement, Vinik had direct involvement in losses of more than $121 million. Alexander Vinnik had been proven guilty of willfully violating US AML laws while a $12 million civil penalty was pending. The affected might get restitution of their funds with the resolution of this case.  ConclusionUS DoJ has said in a statement that Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national, has pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering. The mentioned person had been involved in money laundering through the virtual cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e. The mentioned exchange was seized in 2017 by US authorities.

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) to Surge 7,000% Within 48 Hours, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Whale Alert: Massive 1.75 Trillion Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Purchase on Robinhood Draws Speculation | Cryptoglobe


                                
A major anonymous Shiba Inu whale wallet executed a series of large transactions on the popular Robinhood exchange, accumulating a staggering 1.75 trillion $SHIB tokens, valued at roughly $40 million.



The whale’s accumulation was first spotted by whale monitoring service Whale Alert, which pointed on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to two massive SHIB transactions off of Robinhood’s wallets to unknown wallets. Both transactions were of 875 billion SHIB, worth nearly $20 million.







This whale activity coincides with a potential bullish signal for SHIB. According to a recent post by Ali Martinez, a prominent cryptocurrency trader, Shiba Inu’s daily chart appears to be forming a “bull flag,” a technical indicator suggesting an imminent price surge. 



Anticipating this breakout, Martinez revealed plans to place buy orders around the $0.000018343 mark, aiming to capitalize on a potential rise in SHIB’s price.







As CryptoGlobe reported, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency has according to blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant seen its reserves on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges drop to their lowest level since February 2022.



CryptoQuant’s data also shows a predominantly negative SHIB exchange netflow over the past week, showing a large movement of tokens from centralized exchanges to self-custody wallets that suggests a decrease in immediate selling pressure, which is generally considered a bullish signal.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Beyond these exchange-related metrics, other developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem also hint at a potential price rise, with a growing SHIB burning rate helping remove tokens from circulation and reduce circulating supply.



SHIB’s cryptocurrency community has helped it maintain a strong social activity, with social intelligence firm Lunar Crush noting earlier this month SHIB is “signaling bullish” as it has been seeing increasing social activity paired with accelerating market volume and rising price action.



As CryptoGlobe reported, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency could, according to an analyst, surge in the near future based on technical analysis, as the analyst suggested its chart shows a symmetrical triangle pattern, often interpreted by traders as a bullish signal.



A symmetrical triangle pattern is formed by drawing trendlines, one falling and another one rising, along a converging price range. To confirm a valid break and not a false one, traders should look for a surge in volume and at least two consecutive closes beyond the trendline, according to Investopedia.



Symmetrical triangles usually indicate that the price will continue in the same direction as before the triangle formed. Therefore, traders would expect the price to break upward if a symmetrical triangle follows an uptrend.

The $1 Trillion Power Couple Reshaping Finance - The Daily Hodl


								
 
The DeFi (decentralized finance) market has staged an impressive comeback over the past 12 months – with the TVL (total value locked) across all protocols doubling to $93 billion.
Meanwhile, excitement surrounding the capabilities of generative AI continues to build.
A Bloomberg report suggests this industry could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032 and “fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates.”
DeFi and AI (artificial intelligence) are set to go from strength to strength in their respective fields over the coming decade.
But there’s been little discussion about the seismic impact these technologies can have if applied together – delivering exponential growth and revolutionizing finance on a global scale.
In the seven years since DeFi protocols came into existence, a blossoming ecosystem of financial applications and services have been built on top of blockchain networks, offering a modern, real-time parallel to the outdated and slow infrastructure relied upon by traditional institutions.
Smart contracts now offer self-executing agreements that eliminate the need for intermediaries and open up access to lending, borrowing, trading and saving – all with much more competitive interest rates.
When you peel away the complicated jargon and talk of liquidity pools and yield farming, the opportunities that DeFi presents are nothing short of mind-blowing.
In a world where access to banking services is governed by strict eligibility criteria that billions of people are unable to meet, these protocols can secure financial inclusion for unbanked and underbanked populations around the world.
Now, anyone can manage their money through a smartphone.
Funds can be sent and received instantly and cheaply without depending on gatekeepers who charge punishing fees, while those shut out of receiving a credit score can now build a reputation on the blockchain.
By bringing DeFi and AI together, a multi-trillion-dollar power couple begins to form with truly transformative use cases.
But what does this look like in practice – and what are the opportunities and challenges on the horizon as we redefine the future?










DeFi done right
AI’s ability to digest vast datasets in the blink of an eye, make intelligent predictions and connect the dots between trends is going to supercharge the world of DeFi.
We’re barely scratching the surface when it comes to the potential applications.
Algorithms powered by AI can analyze market trends, bringing together news coverage, social media posts, historical data and brand-new figures in the time it takes a human to get a cup of coffee.
Applied correctly, this allows traders to stay ahead of the curve, enables businesses to detect changing behaviors and helps forward-thinking entrepreneurs spot compelling opportunities for new goods and services.
What’s more, all of these in-depth insights can be delivered with full automation, saving time and boosting productivity.
Together, AI and DeFi will also reinvent the way we interact with money, personalizing financial services like never before.
Imagine an algorithm that makes bespoke recommendations on the products you’ll love based on past purchases or uncovers discounts for car rentals and accommodation when you’re booking flights.
While the barriers to entry surrounding investments and financial planning have started to come down in recent years, many consumers still lack the means and the know-how to prepare for a brighter future.
In the coming years, all of that will change, with AI-enriched platforms enabling investors to save regularly, invest wisely and budget meticulously.
And instead of adopting a ‘one size fits all’ approach, each user would be able to benefit from specific plans based on their income and outgoings – with investment portfolios and trading strategies tailored to an individual’s risk tolerance and long-term goals.
Broadening access to fintech can be done safely as AI and DeFi converge.
Both technologies will also prove invaluable in the fight against identity fraud, which cost Americans a staggering $23 billion last year.
Advanced analytics, fueled by machine learning, have the power to detect complex patterns of fraud in multiple locations instantaneously – while the cryptographic security offered by blockchain platforms helps remove some of the attack vectors commonly exploited by malicious actors.
This, when coupled with faster and more accurate KYC (know your customer) checks, can prevent funds from being stolen in the first place, and make DeFi platforms an even safer environment for storing assets.
A win-win situation for consumers and lenders also starts to emerge, thanks to a revolution in credit underwriting.
Applications can be scrutinized using alternative data points – enabling self-employed individuals to access capital rather than suffer arbitrary rejections – with users building a reputation score on immutable blockchains.
This leads to more informed lending decisions for DeFi platforms and the development of robust risk management strategies.
Leveraging machine learning, AI can automate the creation and execution of smart contracts, streamlining operations and eliminating the potential for human error.
We’re already starting to see innovative new projects take advantage of these capabilities like Zircuit, a layer-two blockchain with AI-enabled security, and Ritual, the network for open AI infrastructure.
Innovating responsibly
There’s so much to be excited about – and a lot to be working on. But against this backdrop of innovation, careful consideration must be paid to the potential pitfalls of a close integration between AI and DeFi.
Data quality, privacy and security are three crucial themes that innovators need to focus on as they build new products.
Robust safeguards need to be in place to shield protocols against adversarial attacks.
The complexities of regulatory compliance are another hurdle to overcome, with jurisdictions worldwide set to pay closer attention to both technologies in the years ahead.
There are also ethical implications to reflect on. The purveyors of AI tools need to ensure they mitigate the risk of algorithmic bias that leads to unjust outcomes.
State-of-the-art cybersecurity is required to ensure that the personal data processed by up-and-coming platforms isn’t misused for malicious purposes.
And as AI models are developed, transparency is needed to ensure potential errors can be remedied – and that the public has confidence in the systems they’re interacting with.
Let’s not forget that new technology also represents a steep learning curve for consumers, who can be resistant to change.
DeFi and AI have the potential to redefine finance as we know it.
By democratizing access, promoting inclusion and fostering a more transparent and secure ecosystem, this technological marriage could usher in a new era of empowerment for all.
But to truly unlock their potential, we must address future challenges head-on and ensure these tools are responsibly implemented.
The future of finance rests on our ability to harness the power of AI and DeFi for good.

DOGE, SHIB, PEPE Among Top Performers Daily, BTC Rises to $63K (Weekend Watch)


																Bitcoin’s recovery tour continues as the cryptocurrency jumped from under $59,000 yesterday to a multi-day peak of over $63,000 earlier today.
Most altcoins have followed suit with impressive gains once again, including the ever-volatile meme coin sector.
BTC Goes After $63K
Bitcoin had a highly adverse trading week as its price dumped hard on a few occasions. It all started positively on Monday morning when BTC pumped to almost $65,000, but the bears took control of the market immediately and pushed it south to $62,000.
The declines were far from over as the asset further slumped to and below $60,000. The correction culminated in a two-month low of $56,500 charted on Wednesday, ahead of the latest US FOMC meeting.
Once that was completed and the Fed said it will not raise the interest rates soon, BTC reacted with a $2,000 pump and dump and returned to its starting position. It started to recover more ground in the following hours and neared $60,000 yesterday, as reported.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


It was stopped there at first, but managed to break through that psychological resistance later that day. The bulls kept the pressure on and pushed BTC to a multi-day peak of $63,500. Despite losing some ground since then, bitcoin currently sits at around $63,000.
Its 6% daily increase means that its market cap has risen to $1.240 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands at 50.5%.

DOGE, SHIB, PEPE on the Rise
The top gainers from the largest altcoins come from the volatile meme coin sector. Dogecoin, the first and largest of the cohort, is up by over 12% and now trades at $0.15. PEPE has followed suit with an 11.7% jump, while SHIB has gained 8% and is above $0.000025. The other highly impressive gainer is STX, which has soared by 14% to $2.4.
Ethereum and Binance Coin have increased by similar percentages of around 3.5%. Consequently, ETH has soared past $3,100, while BNB is at $585.
The rest of the larger-cap alts are also in the green, including TON, BC, AVAX, NEAR, and HBAR. The total crypto market cap has recovered more than $200 billion since the low of Wednesday and is up to $2.460 trillion on CG.

Grayscale’s GBTC stops bleeding: First inflow since launch

Grayscale Investments has achieved its first day of net positive inflows for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). This comes after nearly four months of continuous outflows since its conversion to a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January.On May 3, Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $63 million in inflows after recording approximately $17.5 billion of outflows since the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs launched on Jan. 11, according to Farside preliminary data.Among the other funds reported so far, Franklin Templeton's Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) saw its highest ever inflow with $60.9 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led the day's inflows with $102.6 million, followed by Bitwise Bitcoin Fund (BITB) with $33.5 million and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) with $33.2 million.Grayscale's GBTC recorded its first day of inflows on May 3. Source: Farside The crypto community has been speculating how the turn in events might impact Bitcoin’s (BTC) price. Pseudonymous crypto investor DivXman told his followers that the GBTC was the “primary source” of sell pressure across all spot Bitcoin ETFs, but “the tides” could be turning.“That effectively means a significant decrease in sell pressure and additional increase in demand while ETFs collectively are buying more BTC than miners can create,” he explained to his 20,800 X followers in a May 3 post.Crypto trader Jelle predicted to his 80,300 X followers on the same day that Bitcoin's new all-time high is on the horizon.“60 million dollars worth of inflows for Grayscale's ETF. The halving chop will come to an end, and 6-figure Bitcoin will follow shortly after.”Related: Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF ‘halves’ before BTC halvingMeanwhile, crypto trader Jordan Lindsey responded to the news by pointing to Bitcoin’s price saying it is “obviously responding both to outflows and inflows.”Bitcoin’s price has increased 4.91% over the past 24 hours to $62,840 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.Bitcoin has recovered after trading below a key support level at $58,926. Source: CoinMarketCapSeveral factors contributed to Grayscale’s ongoing outflows since the launch of the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. One reason is GBTC's high fees compared to other available ETFs. GBTC's fee is set at 1.5%, whereas the fees for other ETFs are all below 1%.The cheapest is currently Franklin Templeton with a 0.19% fee. Another main driver is bankrupt crypto firms FTX and Genesis selling off large amounts of GBTC shares in an effort to repay creditors.On April 6, Cointelegraph reported that Genesis liquidated approximately 36 million GBTC shares for the amount of $2.1 billion to purchase 32,041 Bitcoin. Magazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?

Explaining Toncoin's [TON] 2x hike - Telegram, USDT, and Pantera - AMBCrypto



TON’s non-zero wallets more than doubled in six months
Growing user activity helped TON defy the broader market downturn in April

Telegram-linked Toncoin [TON] recorded the fastest network growth among the market’s leading cryptocurrencies in the last six months, according to a recent analysis.
TON’s user base doubles
As per Santiment’s report, non-zero wallets on the network more than doubled in the aforementioned time period to 16.8k. In comparison, blue-chip cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] noted a growth of ‘just’ 10% and 11%, respectively.
Here, it’s worth remembering that Bitcoin and Ethereum are much bigger networks and have a higher base vis à vis TON, a shorthand for The Open Network. Regardless, the parabolic growth in user base is a sign that the project has been gaining traction.
Source: Santiment
TON’s on-chain activity exploded last month, with daily active addresses hitting an all-time high (ATH) of 981 on 11 April. On average, around 500 addresses started interacting daily with a network that had not seen the count exceed 100 until as late as mid-March.
The number of new addresses entering the network also picked up pace, peaking at 613 on 11 April.
Source: Santiment
Telegram-powered growth
The sudden jump in usage stemmed from its increasing proximity to social messaging giant Telegram, which has made significant efforts to integrate the native token into its ecosystem.
The original developer of TON, Telegram introduced an ad revenue-sharing system wherein owners of public channels with at least 1,000 subscribers would get payouts in TON. Given Telegram’s monthly user base of 800 million, this is a significant market for TON to tap into.
TON also enabled minting of USDT, world’s largest stablecoin, on its network, allowing Telegram users to send it to each other’s wallets.
TON’s price shoots up in response
These integrations were reflected in TON’s price as it defied the broader downturn in April to log gains of 3.75%, according to CoinMarketCap.

In the last 24 hours alone, TON was up by more than 12% to trade at $5.39. The latest surge was spurred by investments by Pantera Capital, one of the biggest digital assets-focused venture capital firms in the world. The company is betting big on TON’s utility on the Telegram app and its potential to go mainstream.

‘Inevitable’ That Bitcoin Surges Past $100,000 This Year, Says Quant Analyst PlanB - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								Closely followed quant analyst PlanB believes that Bitcoin (BTC) can reach six figures before the end of 2024.
In a new strategy session, the on-chain analyst tells his 157,000 YouTube subscribers that based on prior history, Bitcoin’s price is likely to double the current value to restore BTC miners’ revenue losses due to the April halving.










“What’s next for 2024? 
It is inevitable that we reach $100,000, in my opinion, because miner revenue has to recover. Mining revenue, because of the halving, did halve. All the miners, the entire industry, has seen its revenue drop by 50% and it has to recover. 
Usually, the last three halvings, it did recover within four to eight months. So that’s well within this year, 2024. And the only way for mining revenue to recover is the price doubles. So estimating from current price of $60,000, we should be well above $100,000 this year.” 
PlanB also says his stock-to-flow model, which compares the amount of a commodity in circulation divided by the amount produced every year, suggests that BTC will hit a price target of $500,000 within the next four years.
“I updated the [stock-to-flow] model, parameters did not change much. The 2024-2028 target is still around $500,000 on average.
Also note that the error always goes down after the halving. So there is a halving, the model value goes up. And of course, it takes some time, the Bitcoin price has a lag to catch up with the model value. Every halving it’s the same. It will also be true this halving in my opinion. 
So, we see the error already going down. It will go down again because the price will not be $500,000, of course, in May. It will slowly over the months go into that model price… 
2025, I think the top will be then. Because historically, the top of the bull market has been after the halving, about one and a half years after the halving. So that brings us in 2025. And the big question, of course, is will the price follow diminishing returns, and a price around $200,000 for the top will be in line with diminishing returns; or will price, indeed, follow the stock-to-flow model again and will there be exponential returns again? 
You know my answer. I think stock-to-flow is still valid. I think we will have exponential returns at least until 50% adoption and we’re now at somewhere between 1% and 10%. So far away from that 50% adoption. I think exponential returns are what we’re going to see.”

Bitcoin is trading for $62,868 at time of writing, up 6.5% in the last 24 hours.

Ethereum NFTs on Blast - Should ETH holders worry now? - AMBCrypto



Blast overtook Ethereum in terms of NFT volume
While ETH’s price fell, network growth and velocity grew significantly on the charts

Ethereum [ETH] has largely been dominant in most sectors across the crypto-space. On a certain front, however, it would seem that the tides have shifted in favor of the Blast network.
NFTs on full Blast
Recent data suggests that over the last 24 hours, Blast NFT collections like PAC REKT, Blastopians, and Plutocrats have collectively generated more volume than the entire Ethereum NFT market across all exchanges.
Source: X
Now, even though Blast outperformed Ethereum in terms of NFT volume, a significant portion of this volume can be attributed to wash trading. For context, Wash trading in NFTs inflates trading volume by buying and selling between controlled wallets, creating fake popularity, and misleading investors. It undermines the NFT market by distorting prices and reducing real liquidity.
Even though a large part of Blast’s NFT volume can be due to wash trading, the declining interest in Ethereum NFTs does raise concerns about the state of the network. In fact, AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the number of NFTs being traded has fallen significantly.
Source: Santiment
Taking a deeper look
NFT collections on other networks such as Bitcoin and Mythos managed to outperform Ethereum NFTs. According to CryptoSlam’s data, popular Ethereum NFT collections such as BAYC and Crypto Punks were not able to get into the top 5 most sold NFTs over the last month. The number of Crypto Punk buyers fell by an alarming 20%, whereas the number of BAYC buyers fell by 2.78%.
If this trend continues, Ethereum may lose its top spot in the NFT sector soon.
Source: Crypto Slam
ETH holders bleed
As far as ETH’s price is concerned, at press time, it had climbed back above $3,000 on the back of Bitcoin’s recovery. Additionally, the network growth for ETH continued to rise as well.
Rising network growth is a sign that new addresses have been showing interest in ETH. Velocity climbed too, implying a surge in transaction activity on the Ethereum network.
Rising interest from new addresses and growing velocity could help ETH see green and push the altcoin to the levels it was trading at prior to the latest market correction.
Source: Santiment
However, the size of the addresses showing interest in ETH will also play a key role in Ethereum’s future price movement.
For instance, addresses holding 100-10,000 ETH were declining at press time, according to Santiment’s data. Substantial purchases made by large addresses can play a huge role in ETH’s price trajectory in the future.

Bitcoin Spot ETF: SEC Delays Decision On 7RCC’s Eco-Friendly Fund | Bitcoinist.com


								The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended its review period on the launch of crypto asset management company 7RCC’s Bitcoin spot ETF (exchange-traded fund). 
SEC Extends Deadline For 7RCC’s Bitcoin Spot ETF
In a notice published on Thursday, May 2nd, the SEC said it will now decide to approve or disapprove the 7RCC Bitcoin spot and Carbon Credit Futures ETF by June 24, 2024. This represents an almost two-month (45 days) extension from the initial deadline, which was set for May 10.
The financial regulator said in the filing:
The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change. 

The application submitted to the SEC in December 2023 shows that 7RCC’s fund is designed to provide direct exposure to Bitcoin alongside carbon credits. The firm’s filing revealed that the ETF will track the changes in the premier cryptocurrency’s price and carbon credit futures based on the Vinter Bitcoin Carbon Credits Index.
The ETF intends to invest 80% of its assets in Bitcoin and 20% in financial instruments, such as swaps, that provide exposure to carbon credit futures contracts tied to emissions allowances. Based on 7RCC’s application, the carbon credits are related to the European Union Emissions Trading System, the California Carbon Allowance, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
Crypto exchange Gemini has been named as the custodian of the Bitcoin Spot ETF. If approved, this fund will offer a new dimension to the ETF market, especially after the launch of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January.
SEC To Deny Ether Spot ETFs: Michael Saylor
Another exchange-traded product awaiting the greenlight of the SEC is the Ether spot ETF. Unfortunately, conversations around the potential approval of the investment product have not been optimistic in the past few weeks.
MicroStrategy Executive Chairman and Co-founder Michael Saylor is the latest personality to dampen any hopes of seeing the ETH spot ETF launch in the United States. Speaking at MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin For Corporations conference, the Bitcoin advocate speculated that the SEC would label Ether as a security.

Saylor mentioned that the financial regulator could also designate other tokens, including BNB, SOL, XRP, and ADA as unregistered crypto asset securities. The MicroStrategy CEO said:
None of [these tokens] will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will be accepted by Wall Street, and none of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets.
Michael Saylor is a vocal supporter of Bitcoin, as shown by his firm’s consistent BTC acquisition. As Bitcoinist reported on April 30, MicroStrategy holds 214,400 BTC – worth roughly $13.5 billion as of this writing.

New Solana Memecoin Homo Pepe to Rally 8,000% and Take On Shiba Inu and Bonk



                    

Homo Pepe (HOMPEPE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK).



Homo Pepe (HOMPEPE), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK).




Early investors in SHIB and BONK made astronomical returns, and Homo Pepe presents a similar opportunity.



Homo Pepe has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 5,300% in the coming two days, and Homo Pepe could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Homo Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Homo Pepe on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – HmnxTLpi2QYp9LCB1p8yFgR3X5xqVmE4eAnWU4xMYGe1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, BONK and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMPEPE.

Io.Net: the DePin project announces a crypto airdrop campaign

If you are a former Ethereum miner and have a graphics card, currently the crypto airdrop of the Io.Net Depin project will be right for you.
Participating is free as well as very simple: all you have to do is create your own working node, and connect it to the Io.Net network to provide computing power in exchange for future rewards.
From May 1st, the “Season 2” of the incentive campaign for this project has been launched: we have until May 31st to obtain the highest possible token allocation.
All the details below.

What is and how does the DePin Io.Net project work?
Io.Net is a DePin (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) project that is building a decentralized computer network aimed at offering low-cost computing power.
It operates similarly to Grass, acting as an intermediary for the buying and selling of hashpower, but with a more complex structure.
With the emergence of the trend of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the amount of verified data and the ability to process them are becoming very important factors for the future growth of a suite of new applications.
Io.Net supports this sector by encouraging owners of graphics processing cards, the same ones used for mining ETH during the “Proof of Work” era, to offer part of their computational power to the network.
It is no coincidence that on the official website’s home page, the project defines its infrastructure as “The Internet of GPUs“.
Already today over 550,000 GPUs are connected to the Io:net network, and many AI developers and engineers can take advantage of the computing power absorbed with a simple click, at a discounted price of 90% compared to other cloud providers. The team’s stated goal is to reach 1 million integrated hardware.
From a more technical point of view, it is worth mentioning how the network supports batch inference, parallel training, hyperparameter optimization, and reinforcement learning, optimizing performance on a GPU network for AI/ML workloads.

We remind you that Io.Net is a platform that lives on the Solana blockchain, being able to take advantage of the cost-effectiveness and fluidity of transactions. Solana
From May 1st until the end of the month, a crypto airdrop campaign is ongoing that will reward all users who have created their own working node and shared it with the rest of the network with a token allocation.
A total of 7,500,000 IO tokens have been allocated for this session, which will be assigned exclusively to ecosystem participants who have passed the proof of work verification (automatically performed every 6 hours) and to those who are active during the snapshot.
This will be randomly selected at any time during the month of May.
Regarding the specifications of graphics cards, you can delve into the requirements for bandwidth and other details on this doc.

We remind you that the DePin project is supported by VCs such as HackVC, Multicoin Capital, Sandbox, Delphi Digital, and Aptos, and has recently received funding for 30 million dollars.
Overall Io.Net is valued at 1 billion dollars. Most likely, the IO token’s FDV will be around this figure on the day of its launch on the crypto markets.

How to participate in the crypto airdrop by installing your own working node and using an unused graphics card
As already mentioned, participating in the Io.Net crypto airdrop is free, unless you don’t own a graphics card and have to spend money to buy one.
Actually, even without having a specific processor, it is possible to participate in the campaign in its social part, but we do not expect any particular economic rewards if a node is not created. 
If you are still interested in “social farming” you can take a look at the initiative of Galxe X Discord: complete activities, participate in AMAs and get verified roles on Discord.
For former ETH miners, for gamers, or in general for owners of a GPU with specifications valid for the purpose in question, creating a working node and connecting it to the rest of the network is a piece of cake.
First of all, you need to go to the official website of the project and create your account. Then click on the logo “Io/worker” in the top left corner and select “worker“. Then proceed to “connect new worker” by adding the data of the device you are going to use.
Configure everything by indicating the operating system (Mac OS, Windows or Linux), the provider (Io.net or Render) and, finally, assign a unique name to your device and choose the type of device (GPU or CPU)

Once this is completed, to be eligible for the crypto airdrop you will need to download and configure Docker Desktop (guide for MAC), then start the binary.
In the mobile window, click on “containers“, then open the terminal and paste all 3 commands found on the previously opened web page and start each of them.
Wait for the configuration and click “refresh” occasionally: it may take about 48 hours. 
After completing the configuration, simply type “docker ps” in the terminal and you’re good to go. The “CPU%” column will show the processing power of your processor.
Last advice, to set up the payment account click here and set up a Solana address using a wallet like Phantom.
Below is a guide (prepared directly by the Io.Net team) that shows step by step how to perform the steps just presented on a Windows operating system. In the same Youtube channel there is the same guide for MAC

Hurry up and join the Ai revolution with Io.Net: the crypto airdrop campaign ends on May 31st!

Encryption and encrypted passwords in the world of blockchain and crypto

The storage and secure management of data and passwords is one of the most important aspects in the crypto and blockchain world, and more generally in all online environments.
Encryption, intense as the art of “hidden writings” capable of converting plain text into encrypted text and vice versa, comes to our aid making it difficult for hackers to allow unauthorized access to certain networks and transactions.
Let’s delve into the different methods through which encryption can protect valuable information and safeguard passwords.

Symmetric and asymmetric password encryption in the crypto sector
Generally when talking about password protection in cryptography, reference is made to two encryption methods: symmetric and asymmetric.
That symmetric one refers to a type of text encryption that uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt information: 
The encryption key is shared between sender and recipient and is usually agreed upon in advance: it represents the central element that in cryptocurrencies allows users to access and manage their digital resources.
Symmetric encryption with a single key is one of the most common means to protect passwords, transactions, and communication between operating nodes.
When performing, for example, a funds transfer from one wallet to another, it ensures that the information is read and shared only by two parties involved in the transaction, keeping the data safe from prying eyes.
However, despite the advantages it brings, symmetric encryption has limitations in terms of scalability and key management.
Indeed, the need for communication in pairs greatly limits the expansion of this practice in a system with many more users. At the same time, more users imply human errors in the management and conservation of the so-called “private key”, which if lost leads to the loss of crypto or data stored in the virtual wallet.
To overcome these limitations, asymmetric cryptography comes to our aid by providing a pair of separate keys (public and private) in the encoding and decoding of passwords.
This additional level of security instantly increases data protection: the public key can be shared with anyone on any network (like when we share our address to receive a payment in crypto), while the private key must be kept secret.
Both keys are generated by an algorithm that uses large prime numbers to create two unique and mathematically linked keys. 
Anyway, whoever possesses the public key can encrypt a message, but only the holder of the private counterpart can decrypt the text. We can imagine this as if it were an email inbox: whoever holds the public key can send a message, but only the owner of the private key can open the email and read the messages.
Non-custodial software wallets like Trust Wallet or MetaMask use asymmetric cryptography to offer the highest possible security to their users.

The most common formats of encrypted passwords
Password encryption in the crypto and blockchain sector occurs according to different formats that can be used for different purposes and offer different levels of security:
MD5 (Message Digest 5):
The MD5 algorithm, developed by Ronald Rivest in 1991, generates a 128-bit hash (32 hexadecimal characters) from a variable-length input.
It is no longer considered secure due to vulnerabilities discovered in its algorithm. However, it is still used in some legacy contexts, for example to verify the integrity of files.
SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1):
SHA-1 generates a 160-bit hash (40 hexadecimal characters).
It is no longer considered as secure as it once was, having shown several vulnerabilities: it is now generally replaced by more robust algorithms such as SHA-256 and SHA-3. However, it is still used in a wide range of systems and new applications.
Salt:
The salt is a random sequence of bits that is added to the password before calculating the hash.
It solves the problem of collisions (two different passwords generating the same hash) in hashing methods.
By adding a salt, even identical passwords will have completely different hashes. This makes it harder for attackers to decrypt passwords through brute force attacks.
Bcrypt:
Bcrypt is a hashing algorithm specifically designed for password encryption.
Use a salt and a number of iterations to slow down the hash calculation. It is widely used to protect user passwords in the field of databases.
The choice of encryption format depends on the specific needs of the reference system. Nowadays, it is advisable to use hashing algorithms such as bcrypt or SHA-2 to protect passwords and mitigate cyber attacks.
Hash functions and digital signatures
Another way to protect passwords and valuable information in cryptocurrencies is to rely on hash functions, that is algorithms that transform any form of data into a string of characters of fixed length.
By using robust hashing algorithms, we can effectively protect sensitive information and prevent cyber attacks.
Hash functions are irreversible: it is not possible to convert a hash back into its original data. They are essential in data management on the blockchain because they allow structuring information without compromising its initial integrity
Hashes can also act as fingerprints for all encrypted passwords, protecting the user against unauthorized actions on their account.
Indeed, any modification to the original data would result in a new hash, which would no longer correspond to the original source and therefore would not be verifiable on the blockchain.

Another method to ensure password security, and more specifically the authenticity and integrity of data in a message, is to use the so-called “digital signatures” (asymmetric cryptography technique).
This is simply a method to ensure that the owner of those specific data is approving the transaction. Generally, the sender creates the digital signature using a private key to encrypt the signature data, while the recipient obtains the signer’s public key to decrypt the data. This code represents irrefutable proof that a message has been created solely by the sender and has not been tampered with online.
When talking about digital signatures, one immediately thinks of signature devices like Ledger, Trezor, and Bitbox that allow to validate a transaction before it is broadcasted to the rest of a cryptographic network.
However, be careful not to consider these devices as wallets: they do not contain your cryptocurrencies but only allow you to approve the transactions necessary to spend them.

LayerZero tackles sybil activity with self-reporting mechanism

LayerZero Labs has unveiled a solution to address sybil activity, also known as “airdrop farming.” The creator of the cross-chain communication protocol introduced a self-reporting mechanism, offering sybil users 15% of their planned token allocation for honesty within a defined 14-day period.LayerZero stated in a May 3 post on X that it believes it’s important for its protocol to distribute tokens to genuine, committed network users rather than individuals who engage in sybil farming. Sybil farming refers to the practice of creating multiple fake accounts to unfairly acquire tokens or rewards. The developers want to ensure that their token distribution benefits those who contribute positively to the network’s growth and sustainability rather than those who exploit it through deceptive tactics like sybil farming.Source:  LayerZero LabsIn the hopes of curbing the negative effects of sybil activity, LayerZero Labs is also providing an incentive for users engaged in such activity to come forward and admit it voluntarily. The incentive is that these users can self-report within a specified period and receive 15% of the tokens they were originally allocated without facing further questions or penalties. “We are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked.”The self-reporting process requires connecting a wallet associated with sybil activity and signing a message to confirm ownership. Related: Coinbase's Base could make it the NVIDIA of DeFiLayerZero Labs will enforce consequences for those who don’t self-report by May 17. The first phase involves publicly identifying sybil users who don’t come forward voluntarily, and the second phase allows community members to report suspected sybil activity.The proposal comes on the heels of the first snapshot taken on May 1 related to a potential airdrop distribution to community members. This snapshot marks the deadline for eligibility in the upcoming token airdrop, as confirmed by the team in a graphic shared on X.Airdrops are widely employed by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to create more traction by rewarding early users with newly issued cryptocurrencies. LayerZero Labs did not provide further specifics about the airdrop, but earlier indications suggested they were gearing up for a token launch in early 2024, as per a Dec. 7, 2023, X post. LayerZero’s ZRO was the first Hyperp (Hyperliquid-only perp) to launch on the HyperLiquid perpetual futures decentralized exchange in September 2023.

Hong Kong Asset Management Company Takes Huge Bitcoin (BTC) Move - Bitcoin Sistemi


Yong Rong Asset Management, a major asset management firm based in Hong Kong, has made a significant investment in the Bitcoin Spot ETF, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The firm purchased $38 million worth of the IBIT Bitcoin Spot ETF, which now accounts for 12% of its reported assets.
The move is particularly notable considering Hong Kong has its own ETFs, according to Balchunas. However, with their irresistible combination of low fees and high volume, U.S. ETFs continue to attract international investors.


According to Balchunas, Yong Rong's portfolio is diverse, with his top four holdings consisting of Nvidia, Meta, Tesla and Bitcoin. While Yong Rong's single $30 million ETF investment in IBIT is significant, another Hong Kong firm, Ovata, owns four of the spot BTC ETFs with a total value of $74 million, making it the largest total investor to date .

The total trading volume of six Hong Kong spot ETFs for virtual assets was HK$48.91 million, or approximately US$6.26 million, as of the close on May 3. Among them, the trading volume of Bitcoin ETF was 43.41 million Hong Kong dollars, while the trading volume of Ethereum ETF was 5.5 million Hong Kong dollars. In comparison, trading volume for 11 US Bitcoin spot ETFs on May 2 was a staggering $1.72 billion.

What Does Lower Than Expected US Employment Data Mean? Will there be a Rate Cut? - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to the note of Olu Sonola, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, the US Federal Reserve (FED) will refrain from making any immediate changes to US interest rates. This emerged as a response to lower-than-expected employment figures for April.
Sonola suggests the Fed will need more evidence before it can be confident that the U.S. labor market is showing signs of cooling. Sonola says, “This slowdown in employment growth is good news for those who expect an interest rate cut as soon as possible.”



However, Sonola cautions against drawing conclusions based on a single month's data. “One month doesn't make a trend, so the Fed would probably need to see a few more months of this kind of moderation and better inflation numbers to reintroduce rate cuts (sooner),” he adds.
In its statement after its meeting concluded last Wednesday, the FED decided to keep interest rates constant, as expected. However, it was noteworthy that Jerome Powell made a speech that could be described as 'dovish' at the press conference after the decision.

Bitcoin Back In The Bullpen: Whales Spark Rebound With Massive $2.8 Billion Purchase


								The past few weeks have been a rollercoaster ride for Bitcoin investors. Fears of inflation and geopolitical tensions sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, dragging Bitcoin and its altcoin brethren down to depths not seen since early 2024. Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, plummeted to as low as $56,500 this week, a far cry from its record highs of over $70,000 in March.

However, amidst the carnage, some analysts are seeing signs of a potential short-term recovery. This optimism stems from a confluence of factors, including renewed accumulation by major investors, favorable technical indicators, and historical price patterns.
Whales Dive In: Buying The Bitcoin Dip
One of the most interesting developments is the recent buying spree by Bitcoin whales. These large-scale investors, with wallets holding significant amounts of Bitcoin, have been accumulating the digital currency at a rapid pace.


According to Ki Young Ju, founder of crypto analytics platform CryptoQuant, Bitcoin whales amassed a staggering 47,500 BTC tokens, worth over $2.8 billion, in just 24 hours. This aggressive buying behavior suggests that these whales view the current price slump as a buying opportunity, a sentiment often interpreted as bullish for the market.
Technical Indicators Flash Green
Technical analysts are also scrutinizing on-chain data for clues about Bitcoin’s future trajectory. Dan, another analyst at CryptoQuant, is focusing on the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric, which gauges the profitability of Bitcoin transactions.

When the SOPR dips to the lower Bollinger Band – a volatility indicator – it can signal oversold conditions and a potential price rebound. According to Dan, this is precisely the scenario playing out currently, suggesting that Bitcoin might be poised for an upswing.
Investor Sentiment Cools: A Sign Of Things To Come?
Another interesting observation comes from market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock (ITB). They’ve noted a significant decrease in positive sentiment among investors during the recent correction. While a bearish outlook might seem like a negative sign, ITB argues that this cooling-off period could be a precursor to a rebound.


Historically, periods of lowered investor enthusiasm have often been followed by renewed buying activity as the market finds its footing.

Price Action Confirms Analyst Predictions?

Interestingly, Bitcoin’s price action seems to be validating these analysts’ predictions. As of this writing, BTC is trading at around $63,309, reflecting a 6.3% increase from the previous day’s price point. While this doesn’t guarantee a sustained upward trend, it does suggest that a short-term recovery might be underway.

Bitcoin Whales Bagged $2.8B Worth of BTC in a Day: CryptoQuant


																Bitcoin’s recent market correction that dragged the world’s largest cryptocurrency near the low of $56,500 turned out to be a good opportunity for high-profile investors.
Data shared by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju revealed that whales have accumulated a whopping 47,000 BTC – worth more than $2.8 billion in current price – over the past 24 hours alone. This shopping spree signals the beginning of “a new era” for the primary cryptocurrency, according to the exec.
Bitcoin whales increasing their holdings may indicate growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory among institutional investors or high-net-worth entities.
The CryptoQuant founder also revealed that the whale wallets in question are mostly custodial ones, including ETFs, but clarified that the recent spike is not ETF-related.

There appears to be a change of heart as just a week ago, long-term bitcoin whales saw a substantial increase in their unrealized profits, especially as the price remained above $60,000.
Although their profits had risen significantly, these whales hadn’t yet cashed out, indicating they were holding onto their positions.
This aligned with a notable increase in bitcoin exchange inflows, mostly attributed to whales, which subsequently led to a market-wide slump.
Following the latest whale accumulation, however, bitcoin climbed by over 6% to surge above $62,000 on Friday, staging a modest relief rally.
The whale known as “Mr. 100” bought over 4,100 BTC worth over $242 million at around $58,000 on May 2nd, marking the wallet’s first bitcoin purchase since April 19, just before the 2024 halving.

This Week in Coins: Bitcoin Battered But Rebounds As Meme Coin Mania Abides - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.It was a rough week for Bitcoin—and the wider crypto market—but as of yesterday, things were looking brighter. The price of Bitcoin is now at $63,107. It’s effectively where it was seven days ago, barely down a fraction of a percent, according to CoinGecko data. That's an improvement from when it was trading for below $57,000 per coin earlier in the week. Bitcoin’s mid-week plunge was exacerbated by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) posting their worst day on record on Wednesday. And that was after a bad week last week, too.Even BlackRock’s hugely successful iShares Bitcoin Trust experienced outflows for the first time since its January launch, putting downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price.The sell-off came as investors were spooked by news that the Federal Reserve was not in any rush to slash interest rates. On Wednesday, the central bank’s chairman confirmed just that—saying there wouldn’t be another hike even though inflation was proving sticky. The Fed decided to keep its key interest rate steady.It wasn’t all bad news, though: on Friday, the U.S. government’s Nonfarm Payrolls report showed that the unemployment rate for April was higher than expected, leading to a jump in Bitcoin’s price. When unemployment is high, the Federal Reserve is more likely to cut interest rates. Low unemployment typically means people spend more, leading to increased prices—or inflation. Lower inflation could lead to a cut in interest rates, whetting investor appetite for risk assets like crypto.The jobs figures may have been what lifted BTC back out of its trough. Investors who were betting against the top cryptocurrency saw their short positions liquidated to the tune of $100 million yesterday.Elsewhere, meme coins continued their run, with Ethereum-based PEPE striking big gains and Solana-based BONK having a good week too. Despite a bumpy seven days, they are up over 20% and 15%.Other alts, like Ordinals-based ORDI and Toncoin, started a rally on Friday. ORDI is now priced at $41, a 24-hour jump of 10%, and Toncoin at $5 is up 9%.Perhaps more newsworthy—certainly more shocking—was when a young boy and his mother performed a sordid live spectacle to pump Solana-based meme token LIVEMOM to a $300,000 market cap before disappearing in what looks like a classic rug-pull scam.Even after the duo ghosted, the coin's market cap surged past $500,000. Never a dull moment in the crypto world. Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

BTC-e founder pleads guilty in $9 billion laundering conspiracy

Alexander Vinnik, the Russian co-founder of an allegedly illicit crypto exchange, BTC-e, has admitted guilt in a money laundering conspiracy involving cryptocurrency exchange. This admission follows a broader investigation revealing extensive illegal activities on the exchange from 2011 to 2017.The United States Justice Department (DOJ) reported that during Vinnik’s leadership, BTC-e processed more than $9 billion in transactions and had a user base exceeding one million globally, with many users from the United States. A federal district court judge will determine his sentence in accordance with the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.The U.S. Department of Justice highlighted that the platform was utilized to launder funds acquired from various criminal activities, including computer hacking, ransomware attacks, and drug trafficking.Source: United States Department of Justice Crime DivisionAccording to the DOJ, an investigation revealed that BTC-e operated without essential legal compliance measures, including registration with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the implementation of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) or Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols. These deficiencies made BTC-e popular among individuals seeking to conceal money transactions from law enforcement. Additionally, Vinnik was discovered to have established numerous shell companies and financial accounts globally, enabling the illicit transfer of funds through BTC-e. This activity resulted in criminal losses totaling at least $121 million.Vinnik has been embroiled in legal battles over the past five years for his alleged role as the mastermind of BTC-e. The cryptocurrency exchange is said to have profited from various illicit activities that used the platform to launder some $4 billion worth of Bitcoin.Related: FBI busts $43M crypto and Las Vegas hospitality Ponzi scheme Vinnik was arrested on money laundering charges in Greece in 2017 through a U.S. warrant and was extradited to France in 2020. In France, Vinnik was cleared of ransomware allegations but convicted on money laundering charges and was sentenced to five years in prison. Vinnik’s lawyers launched an unsuccessful appeal, maintaining that Vinnik was just an exchange employee and had no involvement in illicit activities at BTC-e. After serving two years in a French prison, he was extradited to the U.S. on Aug. 5, 2022.The Justice Department recognized the Greek government’s cooperation in extraditing Vinnik to the United States. Vinnik had earlier tried to secure a prisoner swap deal for him to be considered as part of a prisoner trade deal between Russia and the United States.U.S. authorities have brought similar criminal charges against crypto exchanges and their executives. On March 28, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years for seven felony charges.Magazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime

XRP Surged Amid Increased Activity In The Ongoing Case Between the SEC and Ripple


							

Increased litigation activity triggered investors’ interest in XRP this week.



XRP gained 4.52% on Friday by moving from a daily low of $0.51459 to a high of $0.53683.



The court might reject Ripple’s opposition filing but allow the firm to depose Andrea Fox.




Increased activity in the ongoing case between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple triggered investors’ interest in XRP this week. The embattled altcoin experienced notable volatility, returning consecutive profits for three days. TradingView data shows that on Friday alone, XRP gained 4.52% by moving from a daily low of $0.51459 to a high of $0.53683.



Friday’s XRP price movement rounded up a busy week for the altcoin following a series of events between the SEC and Ripple. Both parties involved themselves in motions and countermotions, arguing over the ongoing case and seeking the court to rule in their favor.



Earlier in the week, the SEC filed against Ripple’s “Motion to Strike,” which sought the court to discount the testimony and exhibit from Andrea Fox, the SEC’s enforcement accountant. The fintech firm cited several reasons for its motion, including the late inclusion of new expert materials.



In its filing, the SEC argued that Fox’s testimony did not amount to the inclusion of new expert material and asked the court to strike out Ripple’s motion. Later in the week, Ripple countered the SEC’s filing with an opposing motion, pleading with the court not to entertain it.









Industry stakeholders like Bill Morgan, a renowned crypto lawyer, did not see the possibility of the court granting “Ripple’s Motion to Strike.” However, he foresees a situation where the Judge will allow the firm to depose her based on some expert evidence she provided.



The back and forth between both parties rekindled investors’ interest and generated a buzz around the crypto space. It injected some volatility in XRP, especially as users expect the case to reach a conclusive end soon.



The SEC filed for the court to penalize Ripple with a fine of up to $2 billion for selling XRP as a security to institutional investors. Ripple is defending its position, aiming to convince the court of a lower penalty in the ongoing litigation.

Synthetix Founder Kain Warwick Shares Crucial Fundraising Advice for New Crypto Teams


Renowned blockchain entrepreneur and investor summarizes his thoughts on capital formation incentives in crypto, natural rivalry between VCs and retail investors, evergreen indicators for seed round participants and tough times for early-stage fundraising.Teams are constrained by dominant meta, Kain Warwick admitsIn 2024, even the most successful Web 3.0 teams looking for fresh funds are constrained by the current meta if they want to raise big rounds, Warwick shared in his latest thread on X with 123,000 followers. From the seed investor's point of view, the signals of project's traction — in terms of user base, potential customers, airdrop farmers — remain unchanged: VCs are looking for products with growing TVL, large numbers of X and Telegram followers and so on.That said, investors are still using these primitive indicators of social engagement to calculate the potential number of retail token buyers.As such, introducing points, pioneered by Blast, an overhyped OP Stack L2, became the natural way for teams to prepare for fundraising:So when points meta pops up everyone kind of has to do it. Because competition in early stage raises is intense. If you can incentivise activity and TVL at zero cost you can raise bigger roundsSeed rounds completed at $10 million-$50 million in FDV are "pure cope" for investors, and almost each of them is in profit at the end of the day, Warwick admitted.Crypto fundraising 101 by Synthetix founderPersonally, he recommends to reveal a token for retail at $10 million-$1 billion valuation after three rounds of private/seed funding with VCs:In order to break the current anti-retail meta you need to be face the wrath of VCs and regulators. No 1st time founder is going to do this. The incentives are too strong. Do a low float token launch after 1-3 private rounds and have paper 8 to 9 or even 10 fig networth. Or try to shift the meta and get rekt most likelyAlso, he admitted the role of retroactive airdrops of 2021-2023 as a way to introduce tokens to a large percent of retail owners.As covered by U.Today previously, Warwick estimated the euphoria of meme coins as a natural catalyst for Ethereum's L2s adoption.

Circle's USDC Surpasses Tether in Stablecoin Transactions, Visa Data Reveals



                    

In a surprising turn of events, Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) has surpassed Tether’s stablecoin in transaction volume, according to recent data from payments giant Visa. 



In April 2024, USDC recorded 166.6 million transactions, outpacing USDT’s 163.6 million monthly transactions.




Since the end of 2023, USDC has steadily gained ground in the stablecoin transaction market. 



December of that year marked a milestone when USDC’s 145 million monthly transactions exceeded USDT’s 127 million transactions for the first time.



This development comes as a significant surprise to industry observers, given that Tether has long held the title of the world’s largest stablecoin, boasting a market capitalization exceeding $110 billion and accounting for over 68% of the total stablecoin market share. 




Tether’s market dominance makes its stablecoin more than three times larger than Circle’s USDC, currently valued at $33.5 billion.



While USDC has overtaken USDT in transaction volume, Tether maintains a substantial lead in terms of total users.

In April 2024, USDT was utilized by over 34.2 million unique wallets, whereas USDC only saw 9.57 million unique users.




Overall, there were 27.3 million unique stablecoin users and 21.4 million unique stablecoin sending addresses in the past 30 days. 



Visa’s stablecoin analytics dashboard, launched in April, tracks four stablecoins, including USDC, USDT, Paxos dollar (USDP), and PayPal USD. 



According to Visa’s data, these stablecoins recorded over $2.3 trillion in total transaction volume across more than 352 million transactions during the same period.



Stablecoins play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, facilitating swift transactions in and out of digital assets. 



With a total market capitalization exceeding $161 billion, stablecoins constitute 6.63% of the overall crypto market cap, as reported by CoinGecko. 



Visa’s introduction of its stablecoin analytics dashboard aims to provide accessible and comprehensive data on stablecoin transactions across multiple blockchains, cutting through the complexity for industry stakeholders.

Bitcoin and Other Cryptos Set To Begin ‘Slow Grind Higher,’ Says Arthur Hayes - Here Are His Top Altcoin Picks - The Daily Hodl


								BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is saying that crypto assets are likely to benefit from the US monetary policy going forward.
In a new essay, Hayes says that the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve are engaging in “stealth money printing policies.”










According to the BitMEX co-founder, the “slow addition of billions of dollars of liquidity each month will dampen negative price movement” for crypto assets.
“While I don’t expect crypto to fully realize the recent US monetary announcements’ inflationary nature immediately, I expect prices to bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher.”
Hayes says that the recent fall in the prices of crypto assets has offered an excellent opportunity to accumulate.
“I’m buying Solana and doggie coins (memecoins) for momentum trading positions. For longer-term sh*tcoin positions, I’m upping my allocations in Pendle and will identify other tokens that are ‘on sale.’ 
I will use the rest of May to increase my exposure. And then it’s time to set it, forget it, and wait for the market to appreciate the inflationary nature of the recent US monetary policy announcements.”
The BitMEX founder is an advisor and investor in Pendle (PENDLE), a decentralized finance crypto project that lets users tokenize and sell future yields.
On his Bitcoin (BTC) forecast between now and August, Hayes says,
“A rally to above $60,000 and then range-bound price action between $60,000 and $70,000 until August.”
Bitcoin is trading at $62,726 at time of writing.

Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE) Launches on Solana, Will Surge 7,300% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Skinny Doge presents a similar opportunity.



Skinny Doge has market cap below $13,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Skinny Doge could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Skinny Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Skinny Doge on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Skinny Doge by entering its contract address – 913qkdtENF3qvSBZjtoNxETZi93xHgRDuHNGvdzkECF4 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SKINDOGE.

Dogecoin's 280K new addresses - Traders, is this a buy signal for you? - AMBCrypto



New demand for DOGE peaked during the week
Memecoin’s MVRVA ratio hinted at a buying opportunity too

According to IntoTheBlock, the crypto-market’s leading memecoin Dogecoin [DOGE] has recorded a major spike in new demand. On 2 May, 28,000 new addresses were created to trade DOGE. This figure marked a 102% hike from the monthly low in DOGE’s new demand that was set on 29 April. 
As new demand grew, the daily count of addresses involved in DOGE transactions also rallied over the past week. In fact, data from Santiment revealed that the memecoin’s daily active addresses hiked by 27% in the past seven days alone.
Source: Santiment
Here is how DOGE reacted
An uptick in an asset’s network activity often precedes a rally in its price. However, this has not been the case for DOGE. The sustained demand for the altcoin over the past week failed to initiate any significant jump in its price.
At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.15. According to CoinMarketCap, it recorded a price appreciation of just 2% over the week, with most of it seen over the last 24 hours. DOGE’s minor price rally in the last seven days mirrors the general market decline seen during that period. In fact, the low trading recorded during the period under review pushed the cryptocurrency market’s capitalization below $2.3 trillion on 1 May, before it rebounded. 
However, DOGE’s hike over the last 24 hours is a sign of bullish sentiment.
Also, according to Santiment, DOGE’s weighted sentiment is now poised to breach its center line on an uptrend. This metric tracks the general market sentiment about a crypto-asset. When it returns a value above zero, market sentiment is positive. Conversely, market sentiment is predominantly bearish when its value is below the zero line.
At press time, DOGE’s weighted sentiment was -0.348. This metric’s value will rise if trading activity increases and DOGE extends its gains in the short term.
Source: Santiment

Realistic or not, here’s DOGE’s market cap in BTC’s terms

Now might be your time
AMBCrypto’s assessment of DOGE’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio revealed that it is now flashing a buy signal. This metric, assessed over the 30-day moving average, returned a negative value of -12.83% at press time.

Source: Santiment
An asset’s MVRV tracks the ratio between the asset’s current market price and the average price of every coin or token acquired for that asset. 
When its value is above one, the asset’s market value is significantly higher than the price at which most investors acquired their holdings. When this happens, the asset is said to be overvalued. 
On the other hand, when it returns a negative value, the asset is said to be undervalued, as its market value is below the average purchase price of all its tokens in circulation. 
Traders interpret a negative MVRV ratio as a sign to “buy the dip” in anticipation of a price rally.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse defends Ethereum against SEC scrutiny

Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, has gone on a public defense of Ethereum in response to heightened scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) In one of the events held in Las Vegas, Brad Garlinghouse questioned SEC’s approach to Ethereum and Ripple (XRP). He argued that the regurgitative stand of the regulatory body is not very fruitful. These comments were made at a fireside chat at the XRP Las Vegas 2024 event where Michael Arrington, the founder of Arrington Capital, took the moderating role.Following the comments made by Michael Saylor, the MicroStrategy CEO, the debate on whether Ethereum is classified as a security has gone up a notch by labeling ETH and the other major cryptos as unregistered securities. In contrast with Saylor, Brad Garlinghouse has been a constant proponent of Ethereum, demonstrating the winning of Ripple against the SEC when a judge stated that XRP was not a security.Brad Garlinghouse’s statement was tweeted by pro-crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett in an X post, indicating his criticism of SEC chair Gary Gensler. He labeled Gensler as an “immoral human being,” saying he was overstepping the boundaries in his unitary roles.Consensys sues SEC over Ethereum regulationThe SEC has not yet ruled whether Ethereum is a Security. Instead, the regulator is looking into ETH-related trades to find out if those are solely investment contracts. This intrusion leads to the already current debate about how such virtual currency systems are integrated into existing financial regulations and whether they should be classified as securities.With regard to SEC’s initiatives, Consensys Inc., which is one of the important development components of Ethereum, sues the SEC in Texas. The corporation stated that the SEC is over-jurisdictionally encroached by attempting to govern ETH as a security. They evidenced their claim in support of the fact that Ethereum is not subject to SEC regulations as indicated in the previous statement.The legal fight starts with a 2020 case in which XRP was labeled a security issued by the SEC. In this case, Ripple, rejecting the ruling, went through a legal process which ended in a Federal Judge’s decision last year that XRP is not a security, however, Ripple had violated the law when institutional customers were initially served.Ethereum ETF hangs in balance amid probeThe SEC investigation is contributing to delaying the approval of the Ethereum ETF that will allow investors to buy Ethereum directly on the stock exchange. Investors greatly awaited such a decision. The scenario may be history, as the SEC’s ultimate decision will direct Ethereum’s regulation and its influence as a carrier of funds in the financial sector.Earlier William Hinman, the former head of the SEC’s Corporation Finance division, pointed out that Ethereum was not regarded as a security, a previous statement had mentioned this. This family history makes today’s regulatory environment more complicated, which is the dilemma for both the SEC and those who are for cryptos.

Tesla CEO and the new owner of the Twitter platform (now rebranded as X) Elon Musk has shared with the X and crypto communities that there is now a better tool to beat deepfake scams on this social media giant.Musk stated this while quoting a tweet from Community Notes – a feature on the X app that offers corrections to posts, often warning readers about fake or misleading information in them or simply providing updates.The Community Notes has rolled out an update, which includes improved image matching. It will help to show Notes on a larger number of X posts (roughly 30% more) that contain similar or identical images. Elon Musk commented on this update, saying that “This should make a big difference in defeating deepfakes (and shallowfakes).”This tweet of Musk brought up multiple comments from the crypto community. A lot of X users overall were excites about this new rollout and thanked Musk and the Community Notes. An XRP activist @XRPcryptowolf once again jokingly asked Musk when XRP payments would be made available on X. As reported by U.Today earlier, an XRPL validator who goes under the name Vet, dismissed rumors about XRP payments being tested on the X platform. Still, the company plans to launch internal payments later this year.The Dogecoin community hopes that Musk, as a big fan of DOGE, will add this meme cryptocurrency to the payment options, even though no recent statements from Musk about that have been spotted yet. Still, one thing is clear – X is not going to launch its own cryptocurrency “Xcoin”, according to Elon Musk’s tweets.

Why is the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Surging? Here's Why and a Renowned CEO's Comment - Bitcoin Sistemi

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, is increasingly aligning with the traditional views of investors new to the digital asset space through U.S. ETFs, analysts say.
Bitcoin on Friday surged after a report showed a smaller-than-expected increase in US employment. This situation revived interest rate cut expectations and increased the attractiveness of speculative assets. This rally managed to offset most of the losses incurred earlier in the week due to growing concerns that Fed officials were adopting a more hawkish tone and that demand for ETFs was decreasing.


FRNT Financial CEO Stéphane Ouellette commented on the week's events:

“What this week has taught us is that Bitcoin is at an all-time high and the new development of Bitcoin ETFs is opening up Wall Street participation in the Bitcoin market in a way we have never seen before. Previously, there was no clear correlation with other asset classes. “But this week, especially during the sell-off ahead of the Fed on Tuesday night, it was very clear that Bitcoin was trading in line with other risk assets.”

On Friday, Bitcoin rose nearly 7% to $63,257, contributing to price gains of smaller cryptocurrencies like Ether, Solana, and even memecoins like Dogecoin. On May 1, Bitcoin fell to $56,527, its lowest level in nearly two months.






On Wednesday, investors withdrew a net $564 million from U.S. Bitcoin Spot ETFs, marking the largest decline since these products launched in January. The prospect of prolonged high interest rates has also put pressure on other markets, including stocks.
However, yesterday, for the first time since its launch, Grayscale's GBTC product experienced a net inflow of $63 million.


Bitcoin's decline from its record high of almost $74,000 in March suggests investors are feeling some concern. Youwei Yang, Chief Economist and Vice President of crypto miner BIT Mining Ltd, suggested that traders “may see some risks in the global macro environment that the Fed or general investors have not yet seen.”

Top Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions as of Late


																TL;DR

XRP has remained resilient amidst a general market downturn, with analysts predicting substantial future gains.
The ongoing Ripple v. SEC lawsuit could significantly influence the asset’s price, depending on the outcome.


XRP Future Outlooks
The latest correction in the cryptocurrency market, which resulted in multi-month low prices for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and many other digital assets, was not so devastating for Ripple’s XRP. Despite briefly plunging below $0.50, the token is up 3% on a two-week scale (per CoinGecko’s data).

Multiple analysts believe this could be a great starting point for substantial gains in the near future. One person who outlined such a prediction is the X user Mikybull Crypto. The trader argued that XRP’s “bottom has been confirmed,” adding that the asset is gearing up for an “explosive move.”
Another bullish analyst is Dark Defender, who forecasted that the asset’s price remains poised to reach $1.88 based on the weekly time frame.
EGRAG CRYPTO gave their two cents, too, observing some essential technical indicators. The analyst claimed that XRP has been “dancing around” the 21 exponential moving average (EMA) for quite some time, forming “several shy monthly candles.”




The trader thinks there will be a positive change once “the Kaboom or God Candle” occurs. “We need to stay steady because the big move is just around the corner,” they concluded.
Last month, EGRAG CRYPTO presented two potential paths for the XRP’s price trajectory in the following months. The first scenario depicts the token trading in the $1.20-$1.80 range by June-July, whereas the second option suggests an ascent to an all-time high of $4 by September this year.
Awaiting for News on the Ripple v SEC Front
One major event that could positively influence the price of XRP is a resolution of the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The trial between the entities started at the end of last month, and so far, it has only offered additional confrontation instead of an outcome.
It remains unclear when the case will officially be closed due to potential delays and appeals from both sides and the complexity of the legal process. One person who envisioned a possible settlement in the near future is the American lawyer Jeremy Hogan. He believes a $100 million agreement may occur this summer.

Money laundering allegations fall heavily on the former managers of Cred

In the bankruptcy of the former lender Cred, three actors of managers were charged with allegedly engaging in wire fraud and money laundering charges related to the bankruptcy filing in November 2020.Crypto lending fraud chargesAfter the preliminary hearing on May 2, the ex-CEO of Cred must state admission or denial of the offense by May 8. A press release a few days ago declared they are committed to demonstrating that those engaged in deception and fraud on markets will be prosecuted with the same zeal. Therefore, they can deliver safe markets for investors.The case involves the two former CEOs, Daniel Schatt and Joseph Podulka, who are the respondents to 13 wire fraud and money laundering charges. The charges also go against current chief commercial officer.Source: United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of CaliforniaMark Mosley, the criminal investigation special agent in charge at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, commented, “Its scheme was harsh, unjust, dishonest, that Crypto-Investors were fraudulently deceived out of hundreds of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency at the prevailing market price.”Cred reportedly said he engages in nothing but “collateralized or guaranteed provided lending” and that its cryptocurrency investments are “hedged.” They alleged that it maintains an “all-weather approach” to investment to counteract the volatility.Alleged investor deceptionOn the other hand, the prosecutors alleged that Cred extended numerous loans that “neither required collateral nor guarantees.” Schatt and Podulka were the first to show up in court and set to enter their plea on May 8, while Alexander’s booking date has not been set yet.On the same day that Alex Mashinsky, the former chief executive officer of a failed crypto lender, is set to be sentenced in September 2024, he faces seven felony accusations after the firm collapsed in July 2022.Simultaneously, Genesis, another clapped-out crypto loaning company that declared bankruptcy in early 2023, is striving to satisfy its debts with its creditors. On 2nd April, Genesis, a crypto-financial institution, dumped 36 million shares of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into the market, amounting to as much as $2.1 billion.

Three Former Executives of Cred LLC Charged for Misleading Customers


							

A recent press release states that three former Cred executives have been charged for misleading investors.



The charges against the defendants include conspiracy, wire fraud, and engaging in illicit financial transactions.



The executives charged by the Federal grand jury are Daniel Schatt, Joseph Podulka, and James Alexander.




A recent press release revealed that a Federal grand jury charged three former executives of Cred LLC, a San Francisco-based financial services firm that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020. The executives, Daniel Schatt, Joseph Podulka, and James Alexander, were charged with conspiracy, wire fraud, and engaging in illicit financial transactions.



The allegations against these executives were set out in two separate indictments. The first indictment charged Daniel Schatt, Cred’s co-founder and former CEO, and Joseph Podulka, former CFO. They were charged with conspiracy, thirteen counts of wire fraud, and money laundering.



Similarly, the second indictment charged James Alexander, former Chief Capital Officer, with conspiracy, money laundering, wire fraud, and other charges. According to the press release, these executives began making false and fraudulent statements, misleading customers and investors.









Notably, United States Attorney Ismail Ramsey, Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp, and IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Michael Mosley of the Oakland Field Office announced the charges against the defendants. U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey stated,




 “The Northern District of California is home to many of the nation’s most innovative businesses. Maintaining a market for continued prosperity requires rooting out those who use fraud as a substitute for success. This prosecution demonstrates our determination to keep our markets free of fraudsters and safe for investors.”




As per the indictments, the defendants lured customers to make investments through false promises. They reportedly promised to return a significant yield on the crypto investments. At the time of Cred’s collapse, the customers reportedly suffered a total loss of $150 million in crypto.

Crypto's Volatility Summer | Bankless


Bounce with it. Crypto markets were jostled about by macroeconomic factors this week, meanwhile the degens were basking in new tokens after the arrival of numerous high-profile airdrops! What happened in markets this week?Bitcoin started out the week at $63k and attempted to break above the $65k open from the week prior before rejecting from the level on Tuesday and plunging below the key $60k boundary that had supported price throughout the prior two months.Risk assets ground steadily upwards throughout Thursday and exploded higher on Friday after poor employment data suggested that rate cuts may be imminent, allowing BTC to reclaim its key support level at $60k.Source: TradingViewWhile the total crypto market cap (TOTAL) only narrowly avoided its fifth red week in a row, many degens were recapitalized by a slew of major airdrops this week, potentially providing the fuel needed to send prices higher.Ethereum liquid restaking protocol Renzo and Solana money market Kamino both launched claims for their initial airdrops on Tuesday, April 30, distributing a combined $200M to early users at current market prices.Late Thursday night, friend.tech launched FRIEND, a platform utility token that accrues fees from swaps and can be used to purchase new “Club” keys, to coincide with the release of its V2. With 100% of the FRIEND supply going to users, the token launched at its fully diluted valuation and traded as high as $160 per coin during the early illiquid stages of price discovery, implying a mind-boggling $11B FDV!Unfortunately, FRIEND plummeted back to orbit this morning as users decried the quality of the V2 upgrade and jeeted their holdings from the application in a rush for the exit, draining a net 20k ETH from the application and leaving the token at a much leaner $120M FDV at the time of analysis.Source: @cryptokoryo_research on Dune AnalyticsAlso unveiled this week was the EigenLayer airdrop. While the token is not yet transferable or tradable, its arrival certainly sent shockwaves across the crypto market…Onchain yields continued to compress this week after the announcement, with the implied yield on the most liquid LRT pool on Pendle falling over 700 basis points since last Friday, down to 23.8%.While the promise of airdrops has fueled bull market narratives and inspired many to seek out leverage to best capitalize on the opportunity, their arrival has lessened speculative activity and caused yields to come in significantly during the month of April. Should yields continue to decline, there is a substantial risk that prices will trade lower, considering that holders may begin to sell crypto assets once the returns they can generate are no longer great enough to compensate them for their opportunity costs.Source: Pendle

WIF, DOGE, PEPE, FLOKI, BONK, SHIB: Comparative Price Analysis


							

WIF might hit $4.36 while DOGE might produce a 19.17% increase.



A bullish flag on the FLOKI and PEPE charts suggested a further upside.



BONK was overbought while SHIB might fail to retrace.




Like previous times, meme coins were stars of the show after the market recovered between May 3 and 4. As usual, dogwifhat [WIF] led the cohort with a 24-hour 20.58% increase. Dogecoin (DOGE) also climbed by 13.80% while Pepe (PEPE) increased by 12.93%.



The likes of Floki (FLOKI), Bonk (BONK), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) also joined the rally as their prices outperformed most of the other assets in the market. 



WIF vs. DOGE 



WIF’s price at press time was $3.32 with the 4-hour chart showing no resistance in sight. If this continues to be the case, bears might be unable to stop WIF’s bullish momentum.



The 1.618 golden ratio indicated that the meme coin could target $4.36 as its next support level. Meanwhile, DOGE also correlates with WIF. Should this correlation remain the same, a 19.17% increase awaits DOGE. From its press time price, DOGE might climb toward $0.18 within a short period.







WIF 4-Hour Analysis Against DOGE (Source: TradingView)



However, traders might need to watch out as the RSI showed that WIF was overbought and DOGE was close to a similar spot. If profit-taking begins, the prices of the cryptocurrencies might retrace. On the other hand, a bullish scenario could hand them a higher value.









PEPE vs. FLOKI



PEPE’s market structure was similar to WIF, and FLOKI too was not left out. According to the 4-hour chart, the breakout PEPE and FLOKI experienced was due to the bullish flag formation.



This happened as a result of sellers’ exhaustion. As such, if PEPE’s price rises, there is a high chance the FLOKI will do the same. Also, if the price of PEPE falls, FLOKI might dump. Furthermore, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) was positive, indicating an increasing upward momentum.







PEPE 4-Hour Analysis Against FLOKI (Source: TradingView)



Therefore, the price of the PEPE might continue to rise as well as that of FLOKI. In addition, the On Balance Volume (OBV) increased suggesting that buying pressure was intense to keep the price up.



BONK vs. SHIB



Comparing the BONK and SHIB charts showed that there was a difference in the trend. While prices moved together at some point, they decoupled on other occasions. However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) on the BONK/USD 4-hour chart showed that the token was overbought.







BONK 4-Hour Analysis Against SHIB (Source: TradingView)



This was because the MFI reading was 89.99. Reading over 80.00 indicates that an asset is overbought. Although the reading also signaled that capital flow was high, traders might soon begin to take their money out, leaving SHIB and BONK prices to fall.

Opportunity? Here's Bitcoin's 'most optimal buy' entry before parabolic rally


The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has surged above the $60,000 mark, coinciding with a rise in the stock market amidst a weaker-than-expected US jobs report. 
Consequently, there is a consensus that Bitcoin is poised for further gains, and cryptocurrency trading expert TradingShot has identified potential entry points for investors in BTC. 
In a TradingView post on May 3, the analyst first suggested that Bitcoin’s recent drop to as low as $56,000 brought it close to a critical support level at around $59,000. This movement signals an ideal moment for investors to buy in before a parabolic rally.

Notably, the expert pointed out the behavior of the one-week commodity channel index (1W CCI), which is currently testing the top of its bull cycle support zone. This behavior resembles previous instances, such as September 07, 2020, and March 20, 2017, which preceded parabolic rallies, making them optimal entry points for buyers.
Importance of one-week moving average
The analyst also focused on Bitcoin’s proximity to the one-week moving average 20 (1W MA20), which is significant for the asset. According to the expert, this level has historically served as consistent support during bull cycles. 
At the same time, TradingShot examined past cycles, noting that the 1W MA20 has been breached only three times, none occurring during the 2015-2017 bull run, twice during the 2019-2021 period, and once during the current 2023-2024 run. 
This suggests that the 1W MA20 is technically the strongest support level Bitcoin encounters before the ultimate 1W MA50, typically only breached during bear cycles.
Bitcoin cycle top 
Elsewhere, with Bitcoin recovering, crypto analyst CryptoCon suggested that the maiden digital asset cycle top could be approaching by year-end, echoing patterns seen in 2017. Comparing current market dynamics to 2017, the analyst observed both periods witnessed Bitcoin surpassing all-time highs in March.
However, in 2017, new ATHs emerged by late April or early May, indicating a potentially accelerated trajectory compared to the present.
The market expert indicated that an extended correction around record highs could postpone the cycle top, with projections targeting mid to late 2025.

“To see our top late 2025 as normal, price would need to not make new ATHs for 7 months, or until after November 28th this year,” the expert said. 

Indeed, with most of the market anticipating a Bitcoin rally in the coming months, analysts believe that maintaining gains above $60,000 remains crucial. The asset has rebounded after dropping to as low as $56,000 amid uncertainty surrounding the next Federal Reserve monetary policy.
The latest Bitcoin gains came as the US jobs report revealed a shortfall. Employers added 175,000 jobs last month against expectations of a 243,000 increase. Wages rose by 3.9% in the 12 months through April, below the anticipated 4.0% gain following a 4.1% increase in March. 
This disappointment could pressure the Federal Reserve to cut rates sooner, potentially boosting risk assets like Bitcoin by reducing borrowing costs and weakening the value of fiat currencies like the US dollar.
Bitcoin price analysis
By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $63,170 with daily gains of almost 8%. On the weekly chart, BTC is up less than 1%.

In conclusion, for Bitcoin to initiate a sustained rally, the cryptocurrency requires bullish momentum to drive the asset to $65,000. However, Bitcoin currently remains vulnerable to a potential drop to $60,000.

Airdrop Season's Main Event | Bankless


1️⃣ Rocky Airdrop DebutsTwo of the largest, if not the largest, airdrops, EigenLayer and Friend.tech, debuted this week. EigenLayer's Monday token launch details release largely disappointed users with plenty of quibbles over geo-blocking, governance, equity distribution, and non-transferrable tokens. However, EigenLayer proved responsive to feedback, adjusting their plans to, among other things, give 100 EIGEN to all past protocol users. U.S. users, it's time to schedule your international travel!Friend.tech, on the other hand, faced token claim issues and glitches with their new update. Users also had to interact with V2’s new features to claim most of their tokens, which proved difficult due to errors that hindered transactions going through. Yet, with FRIEND plummeting since launch, some have speculated it has already been oversold.2️⃣ Bitcoin's ReboundBitcoin had a shaky bulk of the week, with U.S. spot BTC ETFs seeing a record $534M in outflows, dropping prices to ~$56K. However, as the week progressed, Bitcoin recovered sharply, nearing $63K after the FOMC meeting and recent employment data. The unexpected soft job data and higher unemployment stand as testaments to the rate hikes working, which could influence the Federal Reserve's next moves. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's new BTC and ETH ETFs debuted strongly, gathering $292M and surpassing some early expectations.3️⃣ LayerZero Goes After Fake UsersThis week, LayerZero's community welcomed the snapshot announcement for their upcoming airdrop. Adding intrigue, the team introduced a 'Sybil turn-in' program, offering individuals who self-report fake accounts 15% of their potential airdrop to combat fraud instead of zero if they get caught. Around 500 wallets have already turned themselves in.4️⃣ ZKasino Team Member Arrested Over Rug PullZKasino, an onchain casino that recently rugged its community but claimed innocence, already looks to be paying the price. On Friday, Dutch authorities arrested a team member and seized ~$12M of his assets, with many speculating that the team member was the project's founder.5️⃣ CZ Skates with a 4-Month SentenceChangpeng Zhao, known as CZ, the former CEO of Binance, faced the music in a Seattle court, receiving a four-month prison sentence for money laundering charges. Initially facing 36 months, the final conviction showcased the positive reputation that CZ had built up over the years, with a judge specifically highlighting the volume of letters he had received pleading for a lenient sentence for Zhao. Seems like it worked.

Friend.tech’s Token Plunge 98% Amid Chaotic Airdrop Claim Process


							

Crypto users have decried the drop in the price of the recently launched FRIEND token.



FRIEND dropped by 98% shortly after its debut amid glitches in the airdrop claim process.



An analyst identified a significant imbalance between the added liquidity and collected fees Friend.tech.




Several crypto users have decried the unprecedented drop in the price of the recently launched FRIEND token of the blockchain SocialFi project friend.tech. Most users involved in the project’s airdrop complained about the claim process as they watched the newly launched token drop by 98% shortly after its debut.



Friend.tech launched last year on Base, the Coinbase Ethereum L2 network, offering an invite-based community via a custom ERC-20 social token, “Keys.” However, the project’s native token, FRIEND, debuted on May 3 with an airdrop to users.



Data from DEX Screener showed that FRIEND/WETH dropped from $169.09 to $0.5293 shortly after launching. In addition, users observed a significant drop in the token’s liquidity, exposing it to massive price swings and increased volatility.



Following the unusual behavior, a Messari analyst identified as Average Joe’s Crypto on X noted an imbalance between the added liquidity and collected fees on the newly launched platform. According to the analyst, the friend.tech’s team added a liquidity level disproportionate to the amounts collected in fees. He highlighted that users paid $30 million in farming costs for a token that has a liquidity of $3 million.



Some other users complained about the clunky nature of the tokens claim portal. Hence, it allowed successful claimants to sell large chunks of the tokens, resulting in plunging prices while others struggled with claiming their airdrops. One user noted that he watched the value of his airdrop go from seven figures to five figures within two hours while watching others cash out significant claims. 









Conditions appear to have improved for FRIEND as of the time of writing, as the token’s price posted a rebound to trade for $1.68, according to data from DEX Screener. The token’s liquidity also reflected significant improvement, showing a value of $17.5 million, with a market cap of $140 million.

Crypto Trader Says Top Ethereum Rival Primed for Massive Bull Run Ahead, Updates Outlook on Bitcoin - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist believes that one Ethereum (ETH) competitor is ripe to witness steep bursts to the upside.
Trader Ali Martinez tells his 61,400 followers on the social media platform X that he is bullish on Cardano (ADA).










According to the analyst, ADA “seems ready for a parabolic bull run” after seeing its value drop by about 50% over the past month. Martinez points out that in 2020, Cardano saw an over 50% correction before going on a vertical rally.
“In 2019, Cardano consolidated within a parallel channel, signaling an end to the bear market.
Following the stagnant phase, ADA broke out of the channel with a 75% surge, then underwent a 56% price correction, setting the stage for an impressive 4,095% bull run.”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
Martinez says that a similar pattern may be playing out this time around.
“Recently, in 2023, something similar happened! Cardano consolidated within a parallel channel, marking an end to the bear market. Following this period of stagnation, ADA broke out of the channel with a 72% surge.
Now, ADA has undergone a 50% price correction, setting the stage for an impressive bull run ahead!”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that Cardano will appreciate by roughly 2,080% from current levels.
Cardano is trading at $0.467 at time of writing.
As for Bitcoin (BTC), Martinez says that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator is flashing a bullish signal for the crypto king.
Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles.
Says Martinez,
“The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the Bitcoin daily chart. It anticipates a one to four daily candlesticks rebound for BTC.”

Bitcoin is trading at $62,750 at time of writing, up over 6% in the past day.

Bitcoin ETF breaks 80-day losing streak with bullish BTC inflow


As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to recover, United States spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to the cryptocurrency have registered record net inflows.
The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) has successfully ended its 80-day losing streak, capturing a significant $63 million inflow on May 3. This milestone marks the first net inflow since GBTC’s transformation into a Bitcoin ETF back in January.
Recent data from Farside highlights this dramatic shift, with Grayscale’s GBTC securing $63 million in inflows, a stark reversal from the approximately $17.5 billion of outflows it has suffered since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11.


Despite intense competition, GBTC remains the largest Bitcoin spot ETF, managing over $18.7 billion assets under management (AUM) and about 297,000 BTC. However, this continued outflow has allowed newer competitors like the BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which now boasts $16.9 billion in AUM as of May 3.
One of the main challenges for Grayscale has been its fees. The crypto fund manager charges a 1.5% management fee for GBTC holders, which is significantly higher than the fees charged by many other ETF providers, including BlackRock and Fidelity.
This has been a critical factor in the ongoing outflows since January. In an effort to regain its competitive edge, Grayscale is considering launching a “mini” Bitcoin ETF with lower fees to compete with the array of new, highly popular ETFs.
Competing Bitcoin spot ETFs

Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) topped the chart for daily inflows with $102.6 million, followed by the Bitwise Bitcoin Fund (BITB) which garnered $33.5 million, and the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) close behind at $33.2 million.
Interestingly, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded inflows of only $12.7 million, placing it second-last for the day. This indicates that other market players, particularly Fidelity, are gradually catching up to BlackRock.
Additionally, there has been a noticeable increase in investment from Hong Kong-based companies in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, signaling a signaling a growing optimism among institutional investors in these funds.
Prominent crypto influencer DivXman noted on Twitter that GBTC had been the “primary source” of sell pressure across all spot Bitcoin ETFs, but suggested that “the tides” might be turning.

Bitcoin’s price has surged with a one-day gain of 1.65%, reaching $63,930 at press time. This increase coincides with the growing positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, potentially spurred by the encouraging developments in the ETF sector.

Russian Admits to $9B Crypto Laundering Scheme in US Guilty Plea


							

Russian national Alexander Vinnik has admitted to crypto money laundering via BTC-e.



U.S. prosecutors said BTC-e facilitated over $9B in transactions and catered to over 1 million users globally.



Vinnik is now facing the possibility of a 20-year prison sentence at his upcoming sentencing in the U.S.




Russian national Alexander Vinnik has admitted to participating in a crypto-related money laundering scheme, U.S. prosecutors disclosed. Vinnik admitted his involvement with BTC-e, one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges active from 2011 to 2017.



According to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s office in San Francisco, Vinnik was among the operators of BTC-e until law enforcement intervened, closing the exchange and arresting him. Prosecutors revealed that BTC-e facilitated over $9 billion in transactions and catered to over 1 million users globally.



The prosecution has characterized BTC-e as a major conduit for cybercriminals worldwide. It enabled them to transfer, cleanse, and hide illicit proceeds from criminal activities, including hacking, ransomware offenses, and drug trafficking. 



Additionally, the platform is implicated in processing Bitcoin that has been linked to a Russian military intelligence unit accused of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election by leaking Democratic Party emails. 









According to official statements, Vinnik deliberately managed BTC-e to support criminal activities, contributing to financial losses estimated at a minimum of $121 million. He is now facing the possibility of a 20-year prison sentence at his upcoming sentencing in San Francisco. Previously, in 2020, Vinnik was convicted of money laundering charges in France, where he was handed a five-year prison term.



The latest announcement from the U.S. follows the country’s intensifying efforts to combat cryptocurrency-related fraud. Notably, Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of FTX, received a 25-year prison sentence in March for his role in a multibillion-dollar fraud. 



Similarly, Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon were recently found liable for fraud in a civil trial regarding the firm’s collapse. Terraform’s crypto projects LUNA and stablecoin UST imploded in May 2022, which resulted in the loss of $40 billion in investor funds.



Additionally, this week, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, was sentenced to four months in prison. This is due to lapses that permitted illicit actors, including criminals and terrorists, to utilize the services of Binance, the world’s preeminent crypto exchange.

Senate Hopeful and Crypto Lawyer John Deaton Supports Coinbase in SEC Battle



                    

John Deaton, a crypto lawyer currently vying for a Senate seat against Elizabeth Warren, has filed a brief supporting Coinbase in its appeal against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



In a filing dated April 26 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, John Deaton lodged an amicus brief backing a motion for interlocutory appeal on behalf of 4,701 Coinbase customers. 




The document, filed pro bono, aims to advocate for the interests of these customers rather than the exchange itself.



Deaton cited past SEC enforcement actions as evidence that the regulator “does not speak on behalf of digital asset users and investors and intends to offer no regulatory guidance beyond citing the Howey case.” 



He referenced the SEC’s civil cases against Debt Box, suggesting the SEC prioritized harming a crypto company over truth and justice, leading to a judge sanctioning the commission in that instance.




While an April 26 X post directly linked Deaton’s actions to his Senate campaign, he initially positioned himself as a legal representative for Coinbase customers in June 2023, predating his campaign announcement, following the SEC’s lawsuit. 



An April 19 filing indicated the success of his latest motion to file an amicus brief.



Deaton emphasized the importance of representing end users of the technology, asserting that a biased and politically motivated agency shouldn’t speak for them, nor should Coinbase.

84%+ SUI’s Staked Supply Is Held By Founders, Says Analyst


							

Analyst Justin Bons criticizes SUI for its centralized control, alleging that 84%+ of its staked supply is held by founders.



The analyst asserts that SUI’s chart representing its supply over the next seven years is a lie.



While Cyber Capital demanded SUI to reveal their address, the latter reportedly refused.




Justin Bons, the Founder of the crypto research platform Cyber Capital, criticized SUI’s centralized control, highlighting that almost 84% of the staked supply is under the control of its founders. Bons targeted SUI, asserting, “SUI has a great design, except for its token economics.”







Reportedly, SUI boasts a capped supply of 10 billion, with 52% unallocated until 2030. While more than 8 billion SUI tokens are staked at present, over 84% of the supply is held by the founders. Highlighting this crucial point, Bons pointed out, “SUI is centralized.” Further, he added,




“The founders control the MAJORITY of supply without lock-ins & ZERO legal guarantees! The legal fine print protects them, as the truth is sobering…The staked SUI implies there is no lock-in at all!”




Moreover, Bons posited that the SUI chart representing its supply over the next seven years is a “lie.” He added that all legal documents surrounding the fact prove their chart wrong. The analyst chastised the platform for being “extremely deceptive,” alleging a “clear lack of disclosure coupled with lies & unbridled greed.”









Bons also unveiled “someone’s” legal ownership over the unallocated supply. While the researcher demanded SUI to disclose their address, the platform reportedly refused to accept the demand. Instead, they stated that SUI was with custodians like BitGo, Anchorage, and Coinbase Prime. He wrote,




“The sheer greed of SUI’s distribution is mindblowing. As SUI still refuses to give full disclosure on the MAJORITY of SUI supply… This presents us with extreme risk, as the SUI leadership effectively controls network consensus.”




Meanwhile, the SUI token is experiencing a downward trend, aligning with the prevailing trend of the crypto market despite fluctuations. Currently trading at $1.10, SUI has shown a marginal decline of 1.92%. However, the token has exhibited substantial falls over the past week and month, marking dips of 6% and 35%, respectively.

3 cryptocurrencies to avoid trading this week


The cryptocurrency market has shifted from bearish to bullish as the week has developed, following nonfarm payroll data worrying data. However, three cryptocurrencies will go through inflationary events, and speculators should avoid trading them this next week for risk management.
Notably, TradingView‘s total crypto market cap index increased by over $245 billion month-to-date from a local bottom on May 1. Traders suddenly became more optimistic about 2024’s forecasts, as April’s nonfarm payroll data suggests favorable macroeconomics for risk-on assets.
Nevertheless, scheduled token unlocks for this next week will create extra supply inflation pressure for three specific cryptocurrencies. In particular, Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA), Galaxy (GAL), and Hashflow (HFT) will dominate the 7-day cliff unlocks from May 4.


Overall, $56.24 million worth of tokens will be unlocked in the next seven days with a high weight toward the mentioned projects.

Avoid trading Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA)
First, MAVIA dominates the 7-day inflation by 55%, with $30.79 million worth of 6.328 million tokens unlocked on May 6. It is noteworthy that this amount equals 25% of the current circulating supply, potentially having a huge impact on price in the short term. 
Of that, 2.33 million is from vesting contracts from Heroes of Mavia’s pre-sale, worth $9.38 million. 4.35 million MAVIA will be under the team’s control for investments in the community and ecosystem, worth $17.48 million. While slightly less than 1 million tokens will be paid as gameplay rewards, worth nearly $4 million.

Galxe (GAL)
Second, Galxe will release 5.17 million worth around $19.20 million, which represents 34% of this week’s unlocks and 5.8% of the project’s capitalization. Similarly to MAVIA, this is a strong signal for a cryptocurrency to avoid trading, facing such significant supply inflation.
Interestingly, most of the tokens will be unlocked to early investors or strategic sales from the team as profit realization. Only $2.18 million worth of GAL will go for community endeavors and reinvestment in the ecosystem for further growth.

Hashflow (HFT)
Finally, Hashflow has the third-largest cliff unlock this week, scheduled for May 7, with a value of $4.20 million. In total, 13.326 million HFT will enter circulation, heavily weighted toward early investors, ecosystem development, and team profits.

However, despite the above economic analysis, these cryptocurrencies could still display positive price performance in the next few days. Still, a solid risk management strategy also requires cryptocurrencies to avoid trading amid relevant supply pressures.

Moonbirds Copyright Controversy Exposes Flaws in Crypto's IP Obsession - Decrypt

It’s not much of a secret: When NFTs broke out as a coherent asset class in 2021, their value proposition was, chiefly, rampant speculation. Since then, NFT projects have spent untold millions attempting to pivot their brands towards more serious-sounding, sustainable futures; most opted to go all-in on the ephemeral, provocative concept of intellectual property, or IP. It has never been resolved, however, what exactly IP means in such a context, nor to what extent NFT projects can bestow IP rights onto their holders. Those unanswered questions bubbled back to the surface this week, when Yuga Labs—the multi-billion dollar company behind Bored Ape Yacht Club—announced that it planned to bestow exclusive commercial rights onto holders of Moonbirds, an Ethereum NFT collection it acquired in February. There was just one snag with the plan: In 2022, Moonbirds’ original creators filed the collection under Creative Commons 0 (CC0), an extremely firm legal tool that relinquished any copyright claims to Moonbirds NFT artwork, and released the pixelated owl characters into the public domain. Moonbirds’ official statement on the matter, posted Monday, came across like an attempt to sidestep this reality. “If you’ve made stuff during the CC0 era—cool,” the company wrote. “But from now on, you’ll need to own a Moonbird to keep doing so.”Twitter users immediately pushed back. Several, including copyright attorney Alfred Steiner, argued the company’s position was legally invalid—Moonbirds were in the public domain now, and nothing could put that toothpaste back in the tube. It wasn’t long before Yuga appeared to adjust its position. Within hours of the initial announcement, the company’s co-founder and CEO, Greg “Garga” Solano, wrote that Moonbirds-related commercial rights would only be attached to new, 3D versions of the Moonbirds artwork, which would be given exclusively to current NFT holders. Those commercial rights, Solano said, would be akin to those enjoyed by Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT holders. For years, Yuga has allowed BAYC holders to create and sell Bored Ape-themed endeavors like burger restaurants and canned water companies. The implication was that Moonbirds-themed chocolate bars and plush animals might be around the corner—but only current NFT holders would be allowed to create them.So what’s the truth? Can anyone freely riff on the Moonbirds copyright until the end of time? Or does Yuga have the power to control who creates Moonbirds-themed goods?According to Brian Frye, a law professor at the University of Kentucky specializing in NFTs and intellectual property, both statements can be true at the same time—a fact that exposes key issues with how IP is currently understood and discussed within crypto. For Frye, it all comes down to the crucial difference between copyright and trademark. When Yuga says that Bored Ape or Moonbirds NFT holders have special commercial rights, the company is implying that those source from an individual NFT’s copyright.Copyrights protect the content of a work, like the plot of a book or the unique characteristics of a painting. Yuga would therefore maintain that each individual Bored Ape or Moonbird possesses its own copyright, which a holder can wield to their own benefit.But Frye—and other legal scholars including Alfred Steiner—do not believe that commercial experiments like a Bored Ape burger joint actually rely on copyright. Instead, Frye maintains, they’re leveraging the generalized Bored Ape brand, which falls under trademark law. To put it simply: People line up to eat a Bored Ape burger because its affiliated with the Bored Ape Yacht Club brand, not because it happens to depict Bored Ape #6184 specifically. That distinction is a double-edged sword. In the case of the Moonbirds controversy, it means that Yuga likely can police who commercially leverages the Moonbirds brand. But it also means that the entire notion of individualized, copyright-based commercial rights controlled by NFT holders is somewhat fanciful.In practice, Yuga is just saying that it will selectively choose not to sue current NFT holders for trademark infringement. But little would protect said holders if the company changed its mind. The original Moonbirds filed under CC0, meanwhile, will remain in the public domain. But that CC0 distinction does not bestow any rights to the Moonbirds trademark. Any member of the public who tries to open up a Moonbirds ice cream shop in the near future will likely be in for a legal ride, should they get a stern call from Yuga’s attorneys.Decrypt reached out to Yuga Labs multiple times regarding this story, but never received a response. To Frye, the Moonbirds episode reveals how much of a buzzword—and supposed value-add—that IP has become for NFT brands, despite the lack of legal clarity surrounding the topic.“There's a certain subset of [Yuga’s] customers who are really fixated on the idea that IP is important,” Frye told Decrypt. “They don't really even know what it means, but it’s talismanic: ‘IP! I want to own the IP, whatever that is.’”Indeed, in the hours following Yuga’s announcement about Moonbirds this week, the collection jumped almost 30% in floor price—or the cost of the cheapest-listed NFT on a marketplace—according to NFT Price Floor. But that short-term victory could be a pyrrhic one. Ever since the 2022 crypto winter cratered NFT prices, Yuga has struggled to find a way back to the cultural dominance it once enjoyed. It once cost nearly $430,000 to join the BAYC at the project’s April 2022 peak; now it takes just $42,000.Last week, while announcing that Yuga had just undergone a wave of layoffs, CEO Greg Solano said the company had “lost its way.”Getting more aggressive about policing the Moonbirds trademark—which it appears this week’s announcement really boils down to—could temporarily boost holders’ perception of Yuga’s value. It may have already. But in the long run, Frye says, that sort of self-imposed limiting of who can engage with the Moonbirds brand might backfire in crypto—where what’s cool is everything.“The one thing they have going for them is some form of goodwill with their customers,” Frye said. “And to now come back and be like, ‘We're going to try to claw back intellectual property rights that are largely illusory anyway,’ just seems like an incredible ‘L’ for them.”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) to Explode 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kitty With Hat (KITHAT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KITHAT will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kitty With Hat.



Currently, Kitty With Hat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KITHAT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – 3Wdkgv1iTBQQ9MnvA4TkAefe2SLdtSKfHwZbhKcEMZk8 – in the receiving field.




KITHAT currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Cred Executives In Wire Fraud And Money Laundering Charge...


                                Wire Fraud And Money Laundering Charges Against Former Executives                                What’s the NewsIn November 2020, Three Former CEOs, CFOs, and CCOs of a Crypto lender company, Cred are alleged for wire fraud and money laundering charges, respectively. The Cred company is basically a financial services assisting company in San Francisco that is specialized in investments in cryptocurrency. The CEO Daniel Schatt, CFO Joseph Podulka, and CCO James Alexander are accused of wire fraud and money laundering charges in 2020. However, the Cred crypto lender company is already declared bankrupt before the charges. The CEO and CFO are facing 13 charges while CCO is charged with 4 counts. Although, the initial date still needs to be confirmed. The other two former executives Daniel and Joseph appeared in court on 2 May 2024 for the first time. However, they have to be present in the court for further arguments on 8 May 2024.Arguments By Prosecutor and DefendantWhen the case proceeds in court the prosecutors castigate the three executives by clearly stating that Cred crypto lender company is deceiving the customers by misinforming them about Cred’s lending and investment practices in Cryptocurrency. The defenders of Cred crypto lender Company affirm that they are involved solely in collateralized or guaranteed lending. They also added that Cryptocurrency investments are kept within bounds and they have maintained their investment regularly in every aspect against in every dynamic situation. However, prosecutors averted that Cred was neither collateralized nor guaranteed.On 3rd May 2024, The United States Attorney's Office of the Northern District of California averted that they were demonstrating this case to keep the markets free and safe from fraudsters and scammers. They also focus on investors' safety and security.Mark Mosley, in Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent, highlights a predatory and deceitful strategy aimed at defrauding potential victims of cryptocurrency valued at hundreds of millions of dollars based on market valuation.Another Bankruptcy Genesis is a crypto lending platform that filed its bankruptcy in January 2023 and then the company moved on to settle its debts with the creditors. Finally, on 2 April 2024, the company liquidated its assets and liabilities of around 36 million GBTC shares generating $2.1 billion in Bitcoin. Another bankrupt Cryptocurrency lending platform where the Former CEO Alex Mashinsky is alleged with 7 conviction charges in July 2022. The CEO of this crypto lender falls for the charges and now the hearing for the case will be held in September 2024. ConclusionAs per Coin Gabbar's information, the regulatory bodies act strictly in such cases to maintain the safety and security of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. These cases reveal the loopholes in regulatory compliance and organizational functioning. Also the awareness of users and investors in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This case has become a social media sensation and users are anxious about their fund's security and safety. Hence, the executives have to contend with this situation because regulatory norms are taking strict action with context to such frauds and scams. Also Read: Dorsey’s Block Alleged For Violating Regulatory Norms

Bitcoin ETFs Record First Weekly Inflow of $343M Amid Bitcoin $63K Rebound


							

U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF sees first positive fund flow in seven days, with $343M.,



Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust records its first-ever inflow since inception, after draining over $12 billion.



Institutional interest rekindles as Bitcoin reclaims the $63,500 threshold.




The U.S. Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) has witnessed the first positive fund flow after seven consecutive days of trading with negative flow. More remarkable, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded the first-ever inflow since its inception after draining over $12 billion.



According to public records, U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs ended Friday trading with a net inflow of $343 million. This influx was influenced by Fidelity’s FBTC, which alone witnessed a positive flow of $102.6 million. 



Coming next on the ranking was the fund inflow from Grayscale. In particular, Grayscale ETF saw a positive flow of $63 million for the first time since the January approvals. Meanwhile, the firm recorded an outflow of over $12 billion since the approvals.



Other U.S. issuers that saw positive flow on Friday included BlackRock (IBIT), Bitwise (BITB), Ark Invest, Franklin (EZBC), and Invesco Galaxy (BTCO). On the other hand, the ETFs of Valkyrie (BRRR) and WisdomTree (BTCW) saw zero influx.

Notably, before Friday, the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market last saw inflow on April 25. The flows dropped to negative as BlackRock’s ETF saw consecutive trading days with zero influx. Furthermore, the flow to the ETF market dried up amid Bitcoin’s price correction over the past few weeks.  









For instance, after Bitcoin crashed to $56,555 on May 1, these ETF issuers saw a staggering outflow of $564 million the following day. Essentially, institutional investors adopted a cautious approach in their investment towards Bitcoin products amid the market dips.



Meanwhile, in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin reclaimed the $63,500 threshold. Interestingly a renewed interest in Bitcoin ETFs emerged as the U.S. ETFs saw an inflow of $343 million after multiple consecutive days of outflows.

Analyst with 53 Years of Experience Evaluates Bitcoin and Shares Price Target - Bitcoin Sistemi

Veteran commodity trader Peter Brandt made a bullish prediction about the future of Bitcoin (BTC) in a recent article. As Brandt enters the 53rd anniversary of his first futures market trade, he praised Bitcoin as “the trade of a lifetime” and said, “There has never been, and there may never be, another market like Bitcoin.”
Brandt's trading career began in 1971 at the New York Mercantile Exchange, trading pre-1964 silver quarter and dime futures contracts. Over the years, he has traded futures contracts ranging from corn to gold, treasury bills to copper, sugar to palm oil, lumber to cattle, and even iron ore to Idaho potatoes.


Brandt has also added some other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, to his investment portfolio in recent years. However, he frequently criticizes altcoins and is a firm believer in BTC as an asset.
In a blog post linked to his tweet, Brandt stated that the BTC market is unique. He described altcoins and memecoins as “imitations” that owe their existence to Bitcoin. According to Brandt, several factors make Bitcoin unique. These include its unhackable structure, limited quantity, global acceptance, traceability and almost instantaneous transaction ability. He also highlighted BTC's price behavior as an important factor. Overall, he sees Bitcoin as “an attempt to take over the world's monetary system by force.”






Brandt also summarized the large increases in Bitcoin prices since its inception, stating that increases in Bitcoin have often been parabolic in nature.
The Bitcoin chart shared by Brandt shows that Bitcoin has risen irreversibly since its inception, and even major corrections have failed to break the rising BTC line. According to the analyst's chart, the current bullish period started in late 2022 and continues now. Brandt's price target here is to go up to $125,000.

PEPE Primed For A Big Leap: 80% Price Increase Incoming?


                            The cryptocurrency market may be experiencing a cool down, but one meme coin is refusing to catch a cold. PEPE, a token emblazoned with the internet’s famous frog, has defied recent bearish trends with a surge in price and trading activity. This resilience has fueled speculation of a potential “bullish breakout” in the coming days, with some analysts predicting astronomical gains.

PEPE Weathers The Storm
While Bitcoin and Ethereum have taken a breather in recent weeks, PEPE has exhibited surprising strength. Unlike its more established counterparts, PEPE hasn’t succumbed to the broader market chill. In fact, the meme coin has managed to inch up slightly this week and even enjoyed a nearly 10% price jump in the last 24 hours. This resilience has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike.

Trading Frenzy: PEPE Ignites Investor Interest
The newfound bullishness surrounding PEPE is further bolstered by a surge in trading activity. The coin boasts a 24-hour trading volume exceeding a staggering $1.26 billion, placing it firmly in the spotlight. Additionally, PEPE’s market capitalization currently sits at a healthy $3.23 billion, a testament to its growing presence within the crypto landscape.
Technical Analysis Paints A Bullish Picture
Adding fuel to the fire, crypto analyst World Of Charts has identified a bullish flag pattern in PEPE’s recent price action. This technical indicator often precedes a price breakout, suggesting that PEPE might be on the cusp of a significant upward trajectory.

World Of Charts predicts a potential price surge of 80-90% in the coming days if the coin manages to break free from its current resistance level.

Meme Coin Frenzy: A Double-Edged Sword?
Despite the optimistic outlook, a cloud of caution hangs over PEPE’s future. The coin falls under the category of meme coins, a notorious sector within the cryptocurrency market known for its volatility and often lacking strong fundamental backing.

Total crypto market cap currently at $2.2 trillion. Chart: TradingView
Unlike established projects with real-world applications, meme coins often rely on community hype and internet trends to propel their value. This can lead to sharp price spikes followed by equally dramatic crashes.

While the prospect of an 80-90% return on investment is undeniably enticing, experts urge potential investors to approach PEPE with a dose of healthy skepticism. The analyst prediction, while optimistic, should not be taken as financial gospel. The cryptocurrency market, especially the meme coin segment, is inherently unpredictable.

Friend.tech Fiasco: Token Tanks 98% After Airdrop Fails To Deliver


								Friend.tech, a social media platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, aimed to celebrate the launch of its version 2 protocol with an airdrop of its native token, FRIEND. However, the well-intentioned initiative turned into a cautionary tale, with the token’s price experiencing a dramatic nosedive and user frustration reaching a fever pitch.

Friend.tech: Building A Social Network On Blockchain
Launched in 2023, Friend.tech positions itself as a Web3 social media platform that leverages blockchain technology to foster a more “authentic” and “decentralized” online experience.
The platform utilizes a unique “key” system, where users gain access through exclusive invites. These “keys” are essentially social tokens built on the ERC-20 standard, allowing communities within Friend.tech to establish their own governance and economic structures.
FRIENDly Faux Pas: Airdrop Chaos And Price Plunge
On May 3rd, Friend.tech airdropped FRIEND tokens to its user base in conjunction with the version 2 protocol rollout. Initial excitement was quickly dampened as the token’s price exhibited a dizzying rollercoaster ride. Soaring to a high of $167 shortly after launch, FRIEND then plummeted to a value under $2 within a matter of hours.


Analysts point to two primary culprits behind the crash: liquidity issues and a sell-off frenzy. Friend.tech’s initial liquidity pool, the readily available funds for buying and selling tokens, appears to have been insufficient to handle the trading volume.
This lack of liquidity meant that even small sell orders had an outsized impact on the price, pushing it down rapidly. Further exacerbating the situation, a significant number of users who received airdropped tokens opted to sell them immediately, likely capitalizing on the initial price spike. This mass sell-off further depressed the price, creating a vicious cycle.


Claiming Challenges Add Fuel To The Fire
Adding insult to injury, the process for claiming airdropped FRIEND tokens reportedly proved cumbersome for many users. Technical glitches and an unintuitive interface hampered the claiming process, leading to user frustration and accusations of a poorly designed launch.

A Silver Lining, Or A Statistical Mirage?
Despite the initial chaos, there have been some signs of life for FRIEND. Liquidity has improved somewhat, and the number of token holders continues to grow. However, this growth might be misleading.

Bitcoin is now trading at $63.274. Chart: TradingView
With the token price so low, the barrier to entry is minimal, potentially attracting new holders who are simply curious or hoping for a rebound. More importantly, the number of sellers continues to outpace buyers, indicating a lack of long-term confidence in the token’s value.

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) Coin to Rally 7,000% Within 48 Hours, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Pension Funds Are Eyeing Opportunities in Crypto Investment - Fidelity


							

According to Manuel Nordeste, defined benefit plans are talking about crypto assets.



Nordeste thinks small-scale but sophisticated investors are more likely to buy into crypto.



Fidelity’s survey showed that 80% of high-net-worth individuals viewed digital assets positively.




According to Manuel Nordeste, vice president at Fidelity Digital Assets, defined benefit plans and other pension funds have started talking to their investment committees about crypto assets. Nordeste made the statement during an event in London. In his opinion, small-scale but sophisticated investors like family offices and high-net-worth individuals are more likely to buy into crypto. 



Meanwhile, the investment expert noted that his company, Fidelity Digital Assets, is starting to have conversations with larger, real-money institutional investor types, compared to the smaller-scale investors they focused on in their early days. He explained that in the past, Fidelity worked with small specialized asset managers, hedge funds, and the big blue-chip hedge funds.



However, Nordeste highlighted that Fidelity is getting some of the high-end clients and other corporate establishments. Citing a survey conducted by the investment firm, Nordeste noted that 80% of high-net-worth individuals viewed digital assets positively, compared to 23% of pension plans. Furthermore, 48% of those respondents invested in digital assets, with just 7% of pension plans invested in the same.



Explaining further, the Fidelity vice president noted that smaller firms are more prone to taking risks since they either have no investment mandates or the mandates they have are easy to navigate. Comparing them to pensions, he observed that it takes longer for the latter to adjust, and there are fundamental requirements to be in the market.









Last Thursday, BlackRock, one of Fidelity’s rivals, said it expects to see institutions, including pension funds, start trading the Bitcoin spot market. The ETF provider noted that it expects the institutions to access the products through the ETF products approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January.

Michael Saylor has something to say on Ripple's XRP case outcome

Michael Saylor has come under fire from pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan for his recent comments on ADA, Solana, XRP, the native crypto of Ripple, and other cryptos. Reacting to comments made by MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, Bill Morgan has published a number of pieces on the X platform that attack the pro-bitcoin individual.Accordingly, in the midst of the continuous legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has made some daring comments. As the token vs. securities debate intensified, the Ripple CEO not only supported XRP but also Ethereum (ETH) in his most recent comments. Michael Saylor goes up against XRP lawyerAt the Bitcoin for Corporations 2024 event, Michael Saylor, a well-known figure in the crypto industry and executive at MicroStrategy, discussed the potential regulatory challenges that various altcoins may face. According to Michael Saylor, it is possible that the SEC will categorize Ethereum, BNB, Solana, XRP, and Cardano as unregistered securities.Meanwhile, this prediction, shared in early May, has ignited a lively debate within the crypto community. If this classification were to be implemented, it could have a substantial impact on the trading and regulatory environment of these coins in the United States.On the other hand, XRP lawyer Bill Morgan expressed his disagreement with Michael Saylor’s perspective on altcoins, highlighting Saylor’s limited understanding of the crypto market. Morgan highlighted the difference between Ripple, the company, and XRP, the token. It’s worth noting that a judge has previously ruled that XRP is not considered a security, despite Saylor’s prediction of increased regulatory scrutiny for altcoins. Morgan raised doubts about Saylor’s ability to accurately predict Bitcoin’s future, considering his apparent lack of knowledge about the legal status of XRP.Furthermore, Bill Morgan raised concerns about Michael Saylor’s endorsement of Bitcoin as a better investment option than altcoins. Morgan suggested that Saylor’s support for Bitcoin might be seen as promoting an investment contract. In addition, he highlighted the possible contradiction in Micahel Saylor’s position, suggesting that if MicroStrategy were to sell or offer Bitcoin, it could be seen as an investment agreement, much like altcoin transactions on secondary markets.Saylor attacks EthereumOn Thursday, May 2, 2024, while speaking at the MicroStrategy World 2024 conference, he made some remarks concerning ETH that have not sat right with the crypto community. Michael Saylor, who also criticized Ethereum and referred to it as a security, stated that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would almost certainly never approve a spot Ethereum ETF. Twenty days prior to the final deadline of May 23, his remarks concern whether the SEC will grant or deny spot Ethereum ETf applications.Additionally, he predicted that BNB, Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA), which are lower-ranking cryptocurrencies, would be categorized as unregistered securities.Saylor underscored: “None of them will be included in a spot ETF, none of them will ever gain acceptance on Wall Street…”He said quite clearly that Bitcoin (BTC) is the only cryptocurrency that has achieved complete institutional adoption. As there won’t be another one, he dubbed Bitcoin the “singular universal” crypto asset appropriate for institutional-grade investing.The man who started MicroStrategy is well known for his unflinching dedication to Bitcoin. Saylor made his comments soon after MicroStrategy disclosed that it had added $1.65 billion in Bitcoin to its corporate reserves for the first quarter.Two days earlier, MicroStrategy also debuted MicroStrategy Orange, a decentralized identity (DID) system based on Bitcoin. Apart from maintaining a sizable Bitcoin holding on its balance sheet, the business has been putting up a lot of effort to strengthen the Bitcoin ecosystem.

What does Shiba Inu's price surge today have to do with PayPal?

Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens are now available for purchase by PayPal users in the United States as a result of a recent partnership with the industry’s preeminent crypto payment processor, MoonPay.MoonPay announced its important partnership with PayPal on Thursday. The fundamental objective of the collaboration is to facilitate seamless migrations from fiat currency to crypto assets, such as Shiba Inu.Shiba Inu’s price rally – Everything you need to knowShiba Inu is up today. According to CoinMarketCap, Shiba Inu trades at $0.00002553, a 12.1% surge in the last 24 hours. Thanks to this collaboration, PayPal users in the U.S. now have a convenient way to buy cryptocurrencies such as Shiba Inu using the crypto payment processor MoonPay.In addition, the official report emphasized that the integration streamlines the process of acquiring crypto coins for MoonPay customers who have a PayPal account for online transactions. When choosing PayPal, users have the option to fund their crypto purchases with their PayPal balance, debit cards, or direct bank transfers.It’s worth noting that existing PayPal users don’t have to manually enter any of these details when making crypto purchase transactions.Interestingly, this development follows the increasing excitement among the Shiba Inu Army regarding PayPal’s acceptance of SHIB payment.What other crypto coins can you buy through PayPal?In addition, MoonPay highlighted that users in the United States can take advantage of this new integration to access more than 110 supported crypto coins. MoonPay supports several crypto assets, including SHIB, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana. These assets can be conveniently purchased using your PayPal balance.Unfortunately, certain assets that the payment processor initially supports cannot be purchased through PayPal, as they are not accessible to users in the U.S. Some of the cryptocurrencies I’m interested in are PEPE, BNB, Cosmos (ATOM), AAVE, UNI, and TON, among others.It is important to mention that crypto purchases through PayPal are currently accessible to MoonPay users in the U.S. However, the report highlights that this solution is anticipated to be implemented across MoonPay’s partner networks by the end of the year.In addition, MoonPay has announced that in the coming months, users in the United States will be able to sell cryptocurrencies through PayPal. The payment processor also announced plans to expand this service to users in the U.K. and the EU.Interestingly, the DEX Marswap, built on the Shibarium platform, has recently introduced a new feature that allows investors to conveniently purchase and trade the BONE token from the Shiba Inu ecosystem using PayPal.SHIB also charges on the back of the token burnIn spite of recent substantial selloffs, the price of SHIB has displayed impressive resilience, going against market expectations and continuing its upward trend above the crucial resistance level of $0.00002315 at the current moment.According to data from the tracker Shibburn, there has been a remarkable 1009% increase in Shiba Inu’s burn rate in the last 24 hours, resulting in the destruction of 29.11 million SHIB tokens. This substantial rise in the token’s burn rate, a mechanism aimed at improving SHIB’s tokenomics, has further reduced the crypto’s market supply.The SHIB burn rate experienced a significant surge of 1009%, causing the price trajectory to maintain its upward momentum, rising in sync with the broader market trends. Today, SHIB once again reached the significant level of $0.000025, which holds psychological importance for the token, as the burn rate continues to rise. Investors are showing a great deal of interest in Shiba Inu, as they eagerly speculate on the coin’s potential price movements in the future.It’s worth noting that despite the significant number of coins sold by wallets in the past day, Shiba Inu has shown impressive resilience by maintaining its upward movement.Coinglass data showed SHIB liquidations totaling $90.39K, indicating a notable decrease in selling pressure compared to previous data. In addition, the open interest surged by 13.73%, reaching a total of $64.76 million, indicating a growing interest from investors in the dog-themed meme token.Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu crypto community has decided against a hard fork upgrade for Shibarium, which has further fueled optimism for its cryptographic journey. The data mentioned above provides a glimmer of hope for the future of SHIB, as crypto market enthusiasts remain interested in the token.

Legendary trader predicts Bitcoin price will 'pump' if this pattern plays out


Veteran trader Peter Brandt has sparked significant discussions in the cryptocurrency sector with his latest forecast, suggesting that Bitcoin (BTC) could potentially approach its previous highs if it continues to follow a classic bullish pattern.
In a post shared on X (formerly Twitter) on May 2, Brandt presented a scenario where, by sustaining its current stability and upward momentum, Bitcoin might witness a substantial price increase, nearing  its historical peak values.

This optimistic outlook, however, has not been well embraced. Some skeptics have questioned Brandt’s credibility, given his previous predictions suggested both a correction to $40,000 per BTC and the possibility that Bitcoin had already reached its peak.


Despite these criticisms, he remains optimistic in his belief that Bitcoin is on a bullish path.
Peter Brandt’s perspective on Bitcoin’s attributes
In his latest blog, Peter Brandt highlighted several unique aspects of Bitcoin that set it apart: non-hackable, limited quantity, globally accepted, trackable, and almost instantly transactional. Additionally, Bitcoin’s price behavior is notably distinct, according to him.

Not only have the major advances in BTC been of a parabolic nature, but of parabolic on a log scale. I can find no other stock, commodity, or publicly traded asset that can make the same claim.
Peter Brandt

This assertion underscores his confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value and distinctive market behavior.
Market reactions and analyst perspectives
Critics of Peter Brandt‘s forecast recall his earlier inconsistent predictions, but he holds firm on his current bullish stance, underscoring the importance of adaptability in successful trading. On the supportive side, Marco Johanning, a noted crypto analyst, reiterated a bullish sentiment on social media:
 “We are in a bull market, and this is merely a correction, not a rally in a bear market,” suggesting confidence in the market’s potential for a rebound.
Contrarily, Scott Melker presents a more cautious perspective, highlighting the lack of key support levels, which, if not maintained, could precipitate a further drop to as low as $52,000.

BTC price analysis

By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $63,870, marking daily gains of almost 6%. On the weekly chart, BTC showed a modest increase of less than 1.5%. For Bitcoin to initiate a sustained rally, it requires bullish momentum to push the asset towards the $65,000 threshold. However, Bitcoin currently remains vulnerable to a potential drop to $60,000.
This period of uncertainty is critical for traders and investors alike as they weigh the mixed signals and brace for potential shifts in the market’s direction.
Whether Brandt’s bullish scenario will materialize remains an open question, but the ongoing debate illustrates the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency landscape.

JUST IN: Bitfinex Responds to Allegations that Data and Passwords of Hundreds of Thousands of Users were Leaked - Bitcoin Sistemi

About 30 minutes ago, allegations that user data of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex had been compromised by hackers and that 2.5 TB of data had been leaked were made by the research company Shinoji Research.
The alleged hack in question was claimed by the ransomware group called Fsociety.However, Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino, who is also Tether CEO, responded to the issue by saying that the hack 'appears to be fake' and the funds are safe:

Everyone is panicking about a possible database breach at Bitfinex.
Long story short, it looks fake.
The alleged hackers published 2 mega links with sample data containing 22.5 thousand email and password records.
We do not store plaintext passwords or 2FA information in cleartext.
Only 5 thousand of 22.5 thousand emails match bitfinex users
The so-called hackers did not contact us. If they had any real information, we would have a bug bounty, a customer support ticket, etc. They would ask for a ransom through We couldn't find any requests.
Different security researchers rushed to spread the word about the breach. From what we can gather though, hackers have likely collected a database of emails/passwords from different crypto leaks. Unfortunately most users use the same email/passwords on multiple sites.
We are conducting a deep analysis of our systems and currently no breaches have been detected.
Also, the KYC platform has heavy rate limitation which will not allow bulk downloading.
While we believe this is pure FUD, we will continue to review the information to make sure nothing has been overlooked.
Funds are safe.

Stay tuned for other details regarding the hot development.*This is not investment advice.

Google moves offices from USA to countries with ties to the BRICS Bloc

As part of its cost-cutting initiatives, Google U.S. terminated over 200 “core” employees and offshored the positions. The employment positions will be relocated from Google’s U.S. headquarters to BRICS nation India and Mexico. Since the 1990s, the United States has outsourced employment to developing nations featuring comparable talent for lower compensation.Asim Husain, vice president of Google Developer Ecosystem, wrote in an email to his team last week that “announcements of this sort may leave many of you feeling uncertain or frustrated.” Google lays off employees and moves to Mexico and IndiaAs reported by CNBC, Google terminated at least 200 members of its “Core” teams on April 25, just prior to the release of its enormous first-quarter earnings report. As part of a reorganization, some positions will be relocated to India and Mexico.Per Google’s website, the core unit is tasked with establishing the technical framework that supports the organization’s most prominent products and ensuring users’ online security. The core teams comprise diverse engineering roles, technical infrastructure, security foundation, application platforms, and essential technical units from information technology, as well as the Python developer team.According to court documents, the company’s Sunnyvale, California offices eliminated at least fifty engineering positions.Since the turn of the millennium, the rate at which the United States outsources employment has accelerated, with Mexico and BRICS member India placing first. A plurality of Google’s U.S. workforce has been laid off as a result of the lockdowns imposed in response to PCV-19.Although India is home to a wealth of skilled individuals, its remuneration is half that of Google’s American staff. In developing nations such as India and Mexico, software and technology professionals are abundant. As a result, although outsourcing proves advantageous for India, it imposes the greatest burden on American employees.Concurrently with BRICS’s effort to generate revenue by exploiting talent, Google has decided to outsource American employment. In addition to the challenge of de-dollarization, American employees are also confronted with the quandary of job outsourcing, which lacks governmental intervention.Further advancing the de-dollarization agenda, Mexico has also contemplated joining BRICS. It is BRICS countries that benefit from the development, while corporations such as Google in the United States disregard global market shifts in favor of profits and inexpensive labor.Alphabet planned job cuts stay the courseSince early last year, when it announced intentions to eliminate approximately 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its workforce, due to a decline in the online advertising market, Alphabet has been reducing its headcount. Despite the recent recovery in digital advertising, Alphabet has continued its reduction efforts this year by laying off employees from several organizations.Midway through April, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat stated that the organization’s finance department would be restructured, including the relocation of positions to Bangalore and Mexico City and the implementation of redundancies. At an all-hands meeting in March, the organization’s search chief, Prabhakar Raghavan, informed staff that Google intends to construct teams in key markets, such as India and Brazil, where labor is more affordable than in the United States, in closer proximity to users.The most recent reductions have been implemented in conjunction with improving profit margins and the company’s highest growth rate since early 2022. Alphabet posted its first-quarter revenue increase by 15% year-over-year and declared its inaugural dividend in addition to a $70 billion buyback, all within the past week.The reorganization teams have played a crucial role in the development of Google’s developer tools. The area in question is undergoing optimization in preparation for the increased integration of artificial intelligence into its products. Google unveiled a significant redesign of its chatbot, Gemini, in February, which matched the name of the suite of AI models that operate it (Bard to Gemini).Google I/O, the company’s yearly developer conference, is approaching on May 14. During this event, Alphabet customarily unveils developer products and tools that have been in development since the last year.

Fox’s status as an expert or summary witness, as well as whether the Fox Declaration introduced new evidence, must be determined by the court.Ripple has contended that the SEC was unable to depose her because her identity and testimony were not furnished during the discovery. Andrea Fox, according to the SEC, was a summary witness who failed to disclose any new information.

When Bitcoin falls, BTC miners suffer - Post-halving's chronicles

Bitcoin halving came and went. Did it meet the crypto market expectations? Sure as hell, no!! The Bitcoin price soared to the moon as promised. Are you joking? Of course, NO!! Who is left to suffer? BTC miners and the suffering is to no end. Why? These miners put in all they had to mine the blocs as designed by Satoshi Nakamoto. Some argue that BlackRock is the very entity holding the industry together.Bitcoin miners suffer, and a big oneThe recent halving event did not meet the expectations of many investors, as the price of Bitcoin experienced a 3.4% decline over the past seven days as of 2:30 p.m. ET. The industry narrowly avoided a more severe collapse thanks to a 4.7% recovery in the last 24 hours.Based on data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Riot Platforms experienced a decline of 13.8% over the course of the week. Marathon Digital also saw a decrease of 11.8%, while Cleanspark experienced a larger drop of 16.2%. At the time of writing, the stocks have experienced significant declines of 12.5%, 10.1%, and 15.2%, respectively.This week’s major news included an inflation report that exceeded expectations and the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain interest rates on Thursday. The Fed has expressed concerns about the possibility of inflation resurfacing. And with rates staying elevated, that could potentially dampen economic activity and limit the available funds for individuals to invest in non-essential or high-risk assets such as Bitcoin.There is a decrease in optimism regarding the influence of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the Bitcoin market due to lackluster demand for launches in Hong Kong and a significant slowdown in U.S. fund flows.Miners are bearing the brunt of this week’s move for a few reasons. Similar to a quantitative analyst, companies rely on BTC to generate revenue. Therefore, a rise in price is beneficial for business, while a fall in price leads to a decrease in revenue and margins.Another significant factor is the presence of Bitcoin on these companies’ balance sheets, amplifying the effect. It can be quite advantageous when Bitcoin is on the rise, but it has a significant impact when it experiences a drop.Following the halving event, the decrease in the mining reward for Bitcoin has prompted speculation among investors about a potential surge in the price. However, Bitcoin miners may experience margin pressure if that scenario fails to materialize.Understanding BTC mining – Where do miners go from hereHistorical data indicates that in bullish market conditions, BTC miners consistently generate higher returns compared to the crypto itself. However, in recent months, Bitcoin miners have faced significant challenges due to the increasing popularity of spot Bitcoin ETFs among investors. Adding to the challenge, BTC recently experienced its fourth halving, which reduced the block reward given to miners by half, significantly impacting their primary income stream.Miners are currently grappling with the daunting task of staying afloat and maintaining their stock prices, unless there is a substantial price surge. Investing in this industry can be quite challenging, as history has demonstrated that halving typically occurs before significant increases in BTC’s price, often causing mining stocks to rise as well. It will be important to monitor in the future whether these companies can generate profits with only half of the Bitcoin reward. Expect an increase in costs, which will likely result in a decrease in margins. However, a potential positive scenario suggests that the remaining players in the market could potentially gain a larger market share and experience advantages from the upward trend in Bitcoin prices.If BTC fails to increase in value in the near future, there is a concern that miners will face more challenges in the financial landscape. They will experience an additional financial burden due to the rising electricity costs and the impact of BTC’s price and the halving.

'Wild swing': Jack Dorsey's company stock erases staggering gains on Friday


Block Inc. (NYSE: SQ), Square’s and Cash App’s parent company, opened May 4 with staggering gains following a positive earnings report. However, Jack Dorsey’s company stock retraced its gains as the day went on, closing the Friday with 10% losses.
Remarkably, Block Inc. shares closed May 3 at $70.30 but jumped 8.81% on Thursday’s extended session. Thus, SQ opened Friday trading at $76.49, gaining the stock market‘s spotlight with positive Wall Street forecasts.
Yet, further development suggests it was a bull trap, as the stock retraced on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). By the end of the day, SQ was trading at $69.47 per share, losing nearly 10% on May 4.


Block In.c (NYSE: SQ) daily price chart. Source: TradingView
In a post on X, Gurgavin Chandhoke, CEO of uINVST and stock market commentator, described this as a “wild swing.” This highly volatile price action happened after Jack Dorsey’s company reported positive results for the first quarter of 2024.

Block Q1 2024 earning report
Overall, Block Inc. surpassed expectations in the first quarter of 2024, achieving a gross profit of $2.09 billion. The company’s main business segments, Cash App and Square, demonstrated strong growth and exceeded analysts’ projections. Cash App’s gross profit rose 25% to $1.26 billion, while Square’s increased 19% to $820 million.
The Cash App saw a 6% increase in monthly transacting active users, reaching 57 million. Inflows per transacting active user also grew by 11% to $1,255, reflecting healthy trends in customer engagement. Block focused on enhancing Square’s product portfolio, particularly in the food-and-beverage vertical, and simplifying merchant onboarding.
Despite noting moderating same-store-sales growth for U.S. customers, Block remains watchful of broader trends. The company’s adjusted EBITDA reached $705 million, surpassing analysts’ expectations, partly due to discipline and efficiency in expense management.
Block raised its full-year outlook, anticipating $8.78 billion in gross profit and $2.76 billion in adjusted EBITDA. For the second quarter, the company expects gross profit between $2.165 billion and $2.185 billion and adjusted EBITDA ranging from $670 million to $690 million. The improved outlook reflects Block’s outperformance in Q1 and increased expectations for the remainder of the year.
Wall Street analysis on Jack Dorsey’s company stock: SQ
Analysts maintained positive ratings on Block, with many citing the company’s solid performance and cost discipline. 
In particular, JP Morgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang maintained an Overweight rating and a price target of $90 per share for SQ. Other Wall Street forecasts reported on TradingView range from $92 to $106 per share despite Friday’s negative closing.
Nevertheless, JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone took a more cautious position, highlighting the importance of further data and positive developments.

“While we acknowledge Cash’s progress in winning deposits, we look for greater confirmation in the sustainability of these before we become more positive.”
– Andrew Boone

This cautious stance is valuable, considering Federal prosecutors are examining Jack Dorsey’s company due to allegedly processing crypto transactions for terrorist groups and nations subject to economic sanctions, as reported by NBC News on May 1.

Grayscale ETF Records First Day of Inflows Ever


The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets, experienced a net inflow of new money from investors for the first time since its debut in January, according to Farside Investors. On Friday, May 2, a net $63 million was added to the trust. GBTC has long been a popular financial instrument for investing in Bitcoin (BTC) without directly purchasing the cryptocurrency. However, it faced increased competition in January when it was converted into an easier-to-trade ETF, coinciding with the launch of nine rival spot Bitcoin ETFs.Due to its relatively higher fees, investors withdrew billions of dollars from GBTC, resulting in a streak of 78 consecutive days of outflows that ended last Friday.Currently, GBTC holds $18.1 billion in assets, while IBIT, which now ranks second, started from zero in January and currently holds $16.9 billion. GBTC's assets have declined from over $26 billion previously.Perfect Friday for Bitcoin ETFsAccording to SoSoValue, the Bitcoin spot ETF experienced a total net inflow of $378 million on May 3, marking the first net inflow after seven consecutive days of net outflows. Additionally, the Grayscale ETF GBTC saw a rare single-day inflow of $63.0112 million.Source: SoSoValueIn Hong Kong, the total net assets of the three Bitcoin spot ETFs amount to approximately $250 million, with holdings of approximately 4,225 BTC. Similarly, the total net assets of the three Ethereum spot ETFs in Hong Kong are approximately $48.52 million, with holdings of approximately 16,000 ETH.Bulls return?BTC ETF flows By May 2, every ETF recorded outflows for the first time, totaling $563.7 million — the largest losses since trading began in January. This decline has persisted for nearly two months, with funds experiencing approximately $6 billion in losses over the past four weeks, representing a 20% drop in assets under management.

                            Tokenized commodities, explained                                        Tokenized commodities, which include energy resources, agricultural products, precious metals and other tangible things, are digital representations of real-world assets. These assets go through a process known as “tokenization,” in which their ownership rights are converted into blockchain-based cryptographic tokens. Partially owned and accessible, each token usually represents a portion or entirety of the underlying commodity.Tokenization offers efficiency, divisibility and liquidity, transforming the asset ownership structure. An example of this would be the tokenization of a $10,000 gold bar into 10,000 tokens, which would allow investors to transact smaller units easily without the logistical burden of physical storage of gold or delivery.                                                                    How do tokenized commodities work?                                        Tokenized commodities are created through tokenization, with tokens issued on a blockchain network, followed by secure storage, decentralized trading facilitated by smart contracts and, finally, redemption facilitated by issuers or smart contracts.Step 1: IssuanceTokenized commodities are created by dividing the ownership rights of actual assets into digital tokens, a process known as tokenization. In this process, tokens are issued on a blockchain network, frequently with the help of exchanges or specialized tokenization platforms.Step 2: Storage and custodyCustodianship of the underlying assets assumes paramount importance in tokenized commodities. Custodial services or smart contracts ensure the secure storage and management of physical assets, assuring tokenholders of asset authenticity and security.Step 3: TradingOnce commodities are tokenized, they become prime assets for decentralized exchange (DEX) or peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. Blockchain technology promotes global liquidity and accessibility by facilitating efficient and transparent trading. Smart contracts are essential to ensure seamless transactions while upholding security and trust.Step 4: RedemptionTokenholders are still able to exchange them for the underlying physical good. Issuers or smart contracts facilitate this redemption procedure, which preserves transparency while giving investors the freedom to transform their digital assets into tangible products.                                                                    Types of tokenized commodities                                        Precious metals, energy resources, agricultural products and real estate are examples of commodities that can be tokenized using blockchain technology.Precious metalsPrecious metals such as gold, silver and platinum can be tokenized because they allow investors to have fractional ownership without the inconveniences of physical storage. Precious metals that have been tokenized make these priceless assets more accessible, encouraging hedging and portfolio diversification.Energy resourcesOil, natural gas and renewable energy certificates are examples of tokenized energy resources that give investors exposure to the energy market’s volatility. Tokenization removes logistical barriers to investment opportunities in the global energy sector.Agricultural productsTokenized agricultural commodities such as soybeans, corn, wheat and coffee enhance investor portfolio diversification by providing exposure to the agriculture sector. Agricultural products that have been tokenized utilize the efficiency and accessibility of blockchain technology to act as tools for diversification and a hedge against inflation.Real estateFractional ownership and liquidity in the real estate market are made possible by tokenized real estate, which redefines property ownership. With little initial outlay, investors can acquire profitable real estate assets, promoting a more diverse range of investing opportunities.                                                                    What are commodity-backed cryptocurrencies?                                        A type of digital asset called commodity-backed cryptocurrencies is intended to provide greater stability than conventional cryptocurrencies. They accomplish this by pegging their value to a tangible good such as gold, oil or real estate. The physical commodity is held by a business or organization, which also releases tokens denoting a specific amount of that commodity.The token’s value varies in tandem with the price of the underlying commodity. With the help of these cryptocurrencies, investors may combine the convenience of digital assets with the traditional commodities market. Examples include Tether Gold (XAUT) and Paxos Gold (PAXG), both backed by physical gold, or OilCoin (OIL), backed by oil reserves.However, be aware that they frequently entail some degree of centralization and that you should always investigate the security and issuer of the actual asset that underpins the cryptocurrency.                                                                    Advantages of tokenized commodities                                        Within blockchain ecosystems, tokenized commodities provide a number of advantages by utilizing the built-in capabilities of distributed ledger technology and revolutionizing conventional commodity trading.Fractionalizing commodities into digital tokens improves liquidity by allowing investors to buy smaller units, which expands the market for available investment options. Additionally, because of this fractional ownership, trading and transferability are made simpler, which lowers entry barriers and boosts market efficiency.Tokenization records ownership and transaction history on an immutable blockchain, increasing transparency and lowering the risk of fraud. Market participants’ trust is increased because every transaction is transparently audited and safely recorded. The possibility of fake products is also reduced by this transparency because every token is uniquely identified and validated on the blockchain.Real-time settlement is made possible by tokenized commodities, eliminating the need for intermediaries and lowering transaction costs and turnaround times. Smart contracts simplify the settlement process and lower counterparty risk by being programmed to automatically execute trades upon fulfilling predetermined circumstances. Furthermore, tokenization makes commodity markets more inclusive and accessible by enabling investors (who were previously unable to participate in traditional markets because of financial or geographical limitations) to engage in trading activities around the clock from any location in the world as long as they have access to the internet.                                                                    Challenges associated with tokenized commodities                                        Blockchain technology has made tokenized commodities possible, but to reach their full potential in commodity markets, various issues need to be resolved. Since tokenized commodities are frequently real assets, they are governed by the same legal frameworks that apply to securities, commodities trade and financial markets. To ensure adherence to these standards, one must navigate intricate legal environments and put strong governance frameworks in place to reduce the risk of fraud, market manipulation and regulatory infractions.There are many obstacles, including liquidity and market depth. Although tokenization can potentially improve liquidity by allowing for round-the-clock trading and fractionalizing ownership, there is still a barrier to building up enough market depth to handle large-scale transactions. Liquidity and price discovery in tokenized commodity markets are contingent upon establishing trust between institutional investors and traditional market players.Standardization and interoperability are necessary for a smooth integration with the current financial infrastructure. Efficient transaction settlement and asset transfer are made possible by interoperability, which makes it possible for token standards, smart contracts and data formats to be compatible across various blockchain platforms and commodities markets.Additionally, because blockchain technology is decentralized and unchangeable, cybersecurity threats are increased in tokenized commodity markets. Strong cybersecurity procedures, such as encryption, two-factor authentication (2FA) and ongoing monitoring, are necessary to protect digital assets, private keys and sensitive transaction data against theft, hacking and exploitation.

BREAKING: A Data Breach Allegedly Occurred on Bitfinex - 2.5 TB of Data and 400 Thousand Users' Data Allegedly Leaked - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to data claimed by Shinoji Research, there was a data breach on the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and the data of 400 thousand users along with 2.5 terabytes of data may have been stolen.
The information has not yet been confirmed by the exchange and users have to wait for the official announcement.


According to Shinoji Research, the FSociety ransomware group, known for its malicious activities, claimed responsibility for the attack. They loaded a page with two mega links to their Onion site. These links lead to a text file containing a partial dump of usernames and plaintext passwords.
Shinoji Research said that the review found that the list did not contain any known accounts belonging to trading firms such as Alameda Research. However, the sheer size of the data indicates that hackers have been able to access every KYC document since Bitfinex's inception.





The hackers issued a warning stating that they would leak the KYC documents of all users if their demands were not met.
In a surprising development, a follower of Shinoji Research tried one of the passwords in the file and received a 2-factor authentication (2FA) warning. This situation was later confirmed by Shinoji Research, confirming the reality of the violation. Bitfinex has not yet responded to these allegations.


However, these are all claims by Shinoji Research and an official statement from Bitfinex should be awaited.

Biggest Video Games Releasing in May 2024 - Decrypt

With so many games coming out across so many platforms, it can be tough to sort through them all. This month's gaming menu offers up something for just about everyone: demanding strategy, intense action, horror, and family-friendly games appear on PC, consoles, and handheld systems.If you want something that will last you hundreds of hours or just an afternoon, then this list has those, too. This list even includes three games that fans have been waiting on for well over a decade. Here's what you can look forward to this month as you look for something new to play.Animal WellRelease Date: May 9Platforms: PC (Steam), PS5, Nintendo SwitchThis is the first game published by YouTuber Jason "Dunkey" Gastrow's studio Bigmode Games, and the buzz has been consistent since the first previews hit. Animal Well features visuals inspired by old-school games and platforming action that promises to match up alongside games like Celeste and Super Meat Boy. Animal Well is full of puzzles, secrets, and demanding platforming.Homeworld 3Release Date: May 13Platforms: PC (Steam, Epic Games Store)Dragon's Dogma 2 fans thought they’d been waiting a long time when the 2012 game finally got a sequel earlier this year—but they don't have anything on fans of this upcoming real-time strategy game. Homeworld 2 released in September 2003, just over two decades ago. Like its predecessor, Homeworld 3 is a real-time strategy game set in space and has players managing their fleet in three dimensions as they battle The Anomaly, a new threat from the outer edges of space.Senua's Saga: Hellblade IIRelease Date: May 21Platforms: PC (Steam, Windows Store, Game Pass), Xbox Series X|SAction studio Ninja Theory's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice garnered praise for both its action and its approach to its main character Senua's mental illness, which figured heavily into her story and the player's experience. Senua's Saga: Hellblade II was one of the very first games announced for the Xbox Series consoles and is a graphical showpiece for the systems. This new chapter takes Senua to Viking Iceland in the 10th Century, where Senua will battle both Vikings and her own mind to save "those who have fallen victim to tyranny."Duck Detective: The Secret SalamiRelease Date: May 23Platforms: PC (Steam), Nintendo SwitchWhile some games on this list could take up dozens and dozens of hours, sometimes you just want a fun game to last an afternoon or two. Duck Detective: The Secret Salami promises about 2-3 hours of silly, adorable mystery as you interview suspects and put clues together to solve the case. Duck Detective has bright, bold art and is fully voiced, promising an entertaining few hours when it hits later this month.Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year DoorRelease Date: May 23Platforms: Nintendo SwitchSometimes the best games are the ones we know and love. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door released for the Nintendo GameCube back in 2004, and even now it's still a beloved entry in both the Paper Mario series and the greater collection of Mario games. This remastered edition promises to bring the original to the Nintendo Switch, updating the visuals and music. The gameplay will reportedly run at 30 frames per second as opposed to the original's 60, but we're hopeful the change won't affect the classic gameplay too much.World of Goo 2Release Date: May 23Platforms: PC & Mac (Epic Games Store), Nintendo Switch, LinuxWorld of Goo is still a fan favorite over 15 years later, thanks to its goofy, oily art style and engaging physics puzzles. The original World of Goo used little googly-eyed balls of goo to create lovingly engineered structures that probably aren't up to anyone's version of code. This new entry promises updated visuals and many more puzzles.Honorable MentionsThere are too many games hitting digital shelves this month to cover them all. If none of these games strike your fancy, then you might want to check out the religious horror game Indika, the survival horror game Crow Country, the full public release of vampire-themed action RPG V Rising, the aquatic exploration game Endless Ocean Luminous, or the variety of other re-releases including the upcoming console release of the System Shock remake, Braid Anniversary Edition, and the PC version of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut.Edited by Andrew HaywardEditor's note: These are all "Web2" or traditional video games with no expected crypto or blockchain elements.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Charles Hoskinson Refutes Michael Saylor's Cardano Claims


As in every criticism made by the crypto community towards Cardano, its founder, Charles Hoskinson, came to its defense. This time, he defended ADA from Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy.
MicroStrategy’s executive president believes that Bitcoin “will be the only institutional asset in the world” and that there will be no other, which he described as “securities.”
Charles Hoskinson Refutes Saylor’s Claims
Michael Saylor opined that BNB, Solana, Cardano, and Ripple will never have spot exchange-traded funds and that large Wall Street banks will never accept them. He even bet that these altcoins will be classified as “securities” by this summer.

“When Ethereum [ETF] is not approved sometime this summer, it will be very clear to everyone that Ethereum is considered a security, not a commodity, after that, BNB, Solana, Ripple and Cardano will be considered securities this summer. They will never be wrapped up in a spot ETF. None of them will be accepted by Wall Street. Bitcoin is the only institutional asset,” Saylor said.

As a result, Charles Hoskinson criticized the stance of MicroStrategy’s CEO. He suggested Saylor is a traditional “Bitcoin maxi” who views all cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin as scams.

“Bitcoiners: ‘Why is Charles attacking Bitcoin? Altcoiners are so Toxic.’ Bitcoin Maxis: ‘Literally everything but Bitcoin is illegal and a scam,'” Hoskinson wrote.

Kadan Stadelmann, CTO at Komodo, agreed with Hoskinson’s stance. He told BeInCrypto that Saylor’s Bitcoin maximalism does shine through most when he notes that most other cryptos are essentially securities. Especially because it is “really easy” to create securities but very difficult to create a commodity, which Satoshi Nakamoto did in Bitcoin.
Moreover, Stadelmann added that nobody knows what the future holds. But it is important to recognize that major companies like BlackRock and FIdelity have done due diligence and applied to roll out spot Ethereum ETFs to the market. If the SEC rejects these applications, the companies could sue the regulatory agency because similar products in the futures markets have been approved.


“Bitcoin is far more established than altcoins. Big companies have conducted a thorough review of Bitcoin – not other crypto assets – and it took them a very long time to do so. However, many people have not heard about Cardno or Ripple, and many know nothing about Ethereum. The unclear regulatory guidelines – due to US Congress’ failure to act – makes the future of Ethereum and other altcoins ETFs uncertain. Without a clear framework an entire industry has been left waiting for clarity,” Stadelmann told BeInCrypto.

It is worth noting that Cardano is on the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) list of securities, along with tokens such as Solana, Polygon, Cosmos, Sandbox, Decentraland, and Algorand, among others.

MakerDAO Prepares Launch of Upgraded DAI Stablecoin and Gov Token


							

MakerDAO announces NewStable and NewGovToken to improve stability and governance.



Token holders can easily upgrade from DAI to NST and MKR to NGT, with a 24,000:1 redenomination for NGT.



The launch includes farming opportunities for NST holders, excluding U.S. residents and VPN users.




MakerDAO, the pioneering Ethereum-based protocol known for its DAI stablecoin, is gearing up for a significant evolution in its ecosystem. As anticipation builds for the upcoming launch season, the protocol has announced the introduction of two new tokens. Specifically, MakerDAO is introducing NewStable and NewGovToken to enhance the platform’s stability and governance.







Notably, the proposed new tokens are part of Maker’s broader strategy to foster adoption and participation. NewStable, codenamed NST, is an upgraded version of DAI that promises to offer improved stability features. The official name will be disclosed during the eagerly awaited brand reveal.



In parallel, NewGovToken (NGT) is being introduced as a sophisticated governance token to incentivize greater community involvement. The final name for NGT will also be announced in the upcoming launch season.



After launch, DAI holders can upgrade to NST, with the added benefit of being able to revert to DAI if they wish. Similarly, Maker token (MKR) holders can convert their tokens into NGT at 24,000 NGT per MKR.



According to the team, these new tokens are not intended to replace the current DAI and MKR tokens. Instead, they seek to expand the ecosystem’s offerings. Users will have the flexibility to choose between the existing and new tokens.









Key functionalities of the coming NewStable include the ability for new and existing users to engage in farming to earn NGT from launch. Six hundred million NGT is distributed annually to NST holders participating in farming. However, this farming feature will not be available to U.S. residents or those using VPNs.



For NewGovToken, the redenomination to 24,000 NGT per MKR is a strategic move to encourage broader participation in governance. The upgrade process is reversible.



Ultimately, MakerDAO is introducing new features and opportunities, including Farming products and the Lockstake Engine, to boost user engagement and attract new and existing users to the Maker ecosystem.

Trader Updates Outlook on Altcoin That’s Exploded Over 900% Year-to-Date, Maps Path Forward for Solana Rival Sui - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist is updating his outlook on one red-hot altcoin amid a crypto market correction.
Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 215,800 followers on the social media platform X that he is long-term bullish on Ondo Finance (ONDO), a project focused on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs).










“ONDO: still one of the best-performing coins and has held up the best. Still also the leader in RWA right now. I think that this looks strong. Not a great active trade though. Better to just buy and hold for now.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
ONDO is trading for $0.839 at time of writing, up more than 920% from its low of $0.082 this year on January 18th.
Next up, the trader predicts that layer-1 smart contract platform Sui (SUI) will turn bearish due to an upcoming token unlock. The next unlock for SUI is in late May when the crypto project plans to distribute 999.23 million tokens among five stakeholders.
Unlocks are often perceived as bearish given the new sellable supply.
Says Altcoin Sherpa,
“Doesn’t matter how good/strong a coin is from a tech perspective. SUI will nuke to Hades once investors start getting their tokens. This thing will have exit pumps though so you can probably buy green box, wait for it to mini-pump, then short it.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
SUI is trading for $1.11 at time of writing, down more than 2% in the last 24 hours.

Google Cloud Unveils Web3 Portal for Blockchain Developers Amidst Mixed Industry Reception



                    

Google Cloud has recently unveiled a Web3 portal tailored for blockchain developers, offering an array of resources ranging from datasets to tutorials on crafting nonfungible tokens (NFT). 



Despite this move, the response from the cryptocurrency sphere has been a blend of enthusiasm and skepticism.




Unchained’s vice president of product marketing, Phil Geiger, expressed concern over the absence of native Bitcoin and lightning support, deeming it a crucial oversight. 



In a post on X dated April 25, Geiger remarked, “No native Bitcoin and lightning support? Seems like an oversight to ignore the most important cryptocurrency.”



Similarly, a pseudonymous crypto trader, MartyParty, conveyed disappointment to his 80,700 X followers on April 26, asserting, “Not impressed Google is way behind.”



Contrastingly, some embraced the launch with optimism. 



Ivaibi Festo, founder of Mitroplus labs, hailed the Web3 portal as a “comprehensive resource” in a post on X dated April 25.



The portal offers developers access to various products and provides testnet tokens for deploying and testing decentralized applications on Ethereum testnets Sepolia and Holesky. 



Additionally, it hosts a learning program featuring tutorials on NFT development, Web3 loyalty program implementation, and securing digital assets through multi-party computation.

This initiative follows Google’s recent strides in the Web3 realm. 




Notably, Google enhanced its capabilities to enable users to search wallet balances across multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon, and Fantom.



Moreover, Google revised its advertising policies at the outset of 2024, permitting certain crypto products to be promoted on major search engines, encompassing Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. 



Preceding the portal’s launch this year, Google focused on forging partnerships to fortify its position in the Web3 landscape.



In October 2023, Google Cloud’s BigQuery data warehouse integrated with MultiversX, facilitating valuable insights for Web3 projects and users through advanced data analytics and AI tools. 



In September 2023, Google’s BigQuery expanded its data warehouse to include 11 blockchain networks, encompassing Avalanche, Arbitrum, Cronos, Ethereum’s Görli testnet, Fantom, Near, Optimism, Polkadot, Polygon’s mainnet, Polygon’s Mumbai testnet, and Tron.

Here's why you should closely watch these 2 cryptocurrencies


The overall cryptocurrency market is experiencing sustained short-term buying pressure, with most digital assets endeavoring to recover from recent losses. While Bitcoin (BTC) garners much attention as it aims to reclaim the $65,000 resistance, altcoins are also attracting significant interest.
In light of this, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies worthy of monitoring. These cryptocurrencies are notably influenced by significant on-chain developments and metrics, which will likely impact their prices amid the prevailing bullish sentiments.
Solana (SOL)
Following the ongoing rally, Solana (SOL) aims to surpass the crucial $150 resistance zone, which is pivotal in achieving another record-high price. Undoubtedly, the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform continues to be the activity center.


It’s worth noting that Solana previously experienced a rally, fueled in part by the growing interest in meme coins launched on the platform. Currently, meme coins are gaining attention again, making Solana a noteworthy asset to watch.
To recap, meme coins on Solana, including Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk Inu (BONK), gained prominence as they sought to compete with established players like Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, the spotlight on dog-themed meme coins appears to wane, with a new class of themed around cats emerging. Recent activity surrounding cat-themed tokens has contributed to the SOL price spike.
For instance, Solana-based Popcat (POPCAT) experienced double-digit gains on May 2, skyrocketing by over fivefold in just two weeks. It will be intriguing to observe whether more cat-themed tokens can replicate the performance of their dog-themed counterparts and potentially influence the value of SOL.
Furthermore, the Solana network has seen a notable increase in its locked value, reaching $4.013 billion at the time of writing, according to DefiLlama data. This figure marks a growth of over 160% in 2024.

The escalating TVL indicates expanding user engagement and confidence in the platform and heightened liquidity and trading volume within the protocol. 
By press time, Solana was trading at $147, gaining almost 4% in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, SOL has been up over 7%.

Shiba Inu (SHIB)
In the short term, Shiba Inu stands out among cryptocurrencies with notable gains, surging by over 10% in the last 24 hours. Beyond the overall bullish sentiment in the market, SHIB appears to benefit from factors such as increased trading activity, token burns, and ongoing network developments.
Of particular interest is the network development, which could be the main driver behind SHIB’s price movements. Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution, Shibarium, underwent a successful hard fork. This upgrade addresses user concerns regarding network usability and transaction efficiency, which are crucial factors supporting SHIB’s price growth.
The development seeks to promote faster transaction speeds by reducing processing times on the Shibarium network. Additionally, it introduces a system for predictable gas fees, making transactions more cost-effective. Security is also prioritized, with enhancements implemented to safeguard user assets and bolster network security.
Furthermore, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted technical indicators suggesting that SHIB was forming a bull flag, indicating a potential bullish breakout. Martinez suggested that the formation could propel SHIB to $0.000072323, representing a growth of almost 180%.

As of the latest update, SHIB is valued at $0.000026, having rallied almost 6% in the last seven days.

In summary, it’s worth noting that besides the underlying fundamentals, the two cryptocurrencies will likely be influenced by the overall market sentiment.

According to on-chain data analytics IntoTheBlock, Dogecoin recently experienced a remarkable surge in network activity, adding a staggering 28,000 new addresses in a single day. Along with the increased network activity, Dogecoin's price has skyrocketed, jumping by 13% within 24 hours.In a tweet, IntoTheBlock reported that Dogecoin activity was spiking with the number of new Dogecoin addresses increasing sharply this week. It said that 28,000 addresses were created on May 2 alone, a 102% increase from the monthly low set on Monday. On-chain data also highlights the growth in non-empty addresses for Dogecoin. Santiment, an on-chain analytics startup, revealed a 27% increase in Dogecoin non-empty wallets over the last six months, totaling 6.6 million wallets.This spike in non-empty wallets could indicate renewed interest and engagement in the Dogecoin community.Dogecoin's price has risen by 13% in the previous 24 hours as a result of increasing demand and favorable sentiment towards the cryptocurrency. This price surge demonstrates the impact of network growth on the value of Dogecoin, as increased adoption is frequently correlated with upward price momentum.The Dogecoin price increase coincides with the general crypto market comeback following the release of weaker-than-expected job data. Cryptocurrencies rebounded on Friday, headed by Bitcoin's (BTC) rise, raising expectations that the worst of the fall may be over.The U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in April, falling short of the expert estimate of 245,000 and the previous month's 315,000 increase. The latest Nonfarm Payrolls data also showed that the jobless rate increased to 3.9% from 3.8% in March.Dogecoin posted a sharp rise consequently, extending its recovery from its May 1 lows of $0.1198. At the time of writing, Dogecoin still sustained gains, up 13% in the last 24 hours to $0.15. If today closes in the green, Dogecoin will mark its third consecutive day of gains.

Gaming needs tokenization - Blockworks


Imagine spending countless hours upgrading your race car in your favorite game, fine-tuning every detail and unlocking new features as you play to make it both beautiful and blazingly fast…only to lose it forever when you stop playing the game. 
What if you could truly own and monetize your in-game creations? Enter the world of tokenized user-generated content (UGC).
Throughout history, humans have prized self-expression and individuality. And in the gaming sphere, this desire has reached new heights with the rise of UGC. Games like Roblox and Minecraft — which average hundreds of millions of players monthly — have revolutionized the industry by empowering players to create worlds, characters, and experiences.
Yet, one key aspect is missing in the majority of these types of games: true ownership. 
While players can create and share content, they have little control over how it’s used or monetized. They spend hours making worlds and upgrading in-game items that add massive value for a studio, driving player retention and enjoyment, without benefiting from the rewards. 
Think about it. The average Fortnite player spends a whopping ten hours a week playing, and some of the most popular builds in the game are player-created. Epic Games (its creator) is directly benefiting from the time these players put into playing and building in the game.
How can we address this challenge and empower players with real ownership and fairer rewards for their creations? 
Tokenization offers a transformative solution.
By representing in-game assets as unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain, players can assert ownership rights and track their creations’ provenance securely. Smart contracts can automate royalty payments, ensuring fair compensation for player contributions. 
To demonstrate this further, imagine if my daughter’s Lego car creation was tokenized. By creating a digital token or NFT of the car, she can formally certify it as her own and earn rewards when it’s traded. She could even receive royalties if someone used her car in their own game. Tokenization makes this possible in the digital realm.
The billion-dollar opportunity
Deloitte predicts that UGC gaming platforms will pay out nearly $1.5 billion to content developers in 2024. But to realize tokenized UGC’s full potential, we must address negative perceptions surrounding blockchain technology in gaming.
To begin, we need to address the user experience issue. Many early blockchain games suffered from clunky interfaces, complicated wallet setups and a lack of intuitive design. Layer this with exploitative microtransactions (think Axie Infinity), and it’s no surprise mainstream gamers were left wary. 
Imagine a gamer having to manually manage private keys or decipher cryptographic hash functions just to play. That’s a surefire way to deter adoption. 
Instead, the focus should be on creating immersive worlds where the blockchain functions invisibly in the background, enabling ownership and monetization without compromising the gaming experience.
The NFT market has also been prone to wild speculation, with some assets selling for eye-popping sums while others go to zero. While this has generated buzz, it has also led to concerns about market stability and the potential for bubble-like behavior. 
For tokenized UGC to gain mainstream acceptance, it’s crucial to foster a more stable, sustainable market driven by the inherent utility and value of the assets rather than mere speculation. This means designing in-game economies with balanced incentives, sinks and faucets to ensure long-term viability. By shifting the focus from speculation to utility, we can build trust and stability in the market.
Read more from our opinion section: Memecoin mania can teach us something
As more games embrace tokenized UGC, blockchain networks will need to handle a massive influx of transactions. If the infrastructure can’t scale to meet demand, we risk congestion, high fees and a degraded gaming experience. 
We want to avoid another Crypto Kitties-style Ethereum network breakdown. To prevent this, developers must choose scalable blockchain architectures that can grow with their player base. This may involve using layer-1 solutions that can bridgelessly connect to other blockchains, sharding or other techniques to increase throughput without sacrificing decentralization or security. It’s also crucial to optimize smart contracts and game logic to minimize unnecessary transactions and reduce the load on the network. 
One of the most important prospects of tokenized gaming is the ability for a users’ in-game assets to move seamlessly between different game worlds. Imagine being able to take your hard-earned sword from one game and use it in another, or having your spaceship navigate through various universes. This level of interoperability would unlock incredible possibilities for player expression and engagement.
The road to mainstream adoption
Achieving this vision requires overcoming significant technical and coordination challenges. Different games may use different blockchain networks, token standards and data models. Bridging these gaps requires robust cross-chain communication protocols and standardized metadata formats.
It will take a concerted effort from developers, players and the wider blockchain community. But if we get it right, the future of gaming will be a more open, collaborative and rewarding space for all.
And we’re on the right track. Over the past two decades, the UGC gaming landscape has undergone rapid transformation, with what once seemed improbable now on the brink of becoming commonplace, thanks to the integration of blockchain technology. 
Tokenization is the catalyst for creating this billion-dollar gamer-driven economy, where players have unprecedented control over their creations. 
The ownership revolution is here; it’s up to us to seize it.

Optimism's Superchain is a $6 billion hit - What does that mean for OP? - AMBCrypto



Optimism Superchain collected massive amounts of revenue for the protocol over the last few weeks
Despite the protocol’s performance, interest in the OP token tanked

Despite the growing competition in the Layer 2 sector, Optimism[OP] has continued to exhibit growth across various fronts.
Super chain brings in the dough
One of the reasons for the same is the Optimism Superchain. Optimism Superchain recently become a magnet for capital, attracting over $6 billion in deposits from Ethereum L1. This surge in popularity can be further underlined by the fact that assets bridged to the Superchain account for a significant portion – 25%, of the total value locked (TVL) bridged from Ethereum L1.
For context, the Optimism Superchain is like a collection of L2s. It bundles multiple L2s together, both technologically and economically. This combined approach offers several advantages, including streamlined operations and potential cost efficiencies.
As an incentive for participating in the Superchain, Optimism furnishes developers with access to a valuable toolkit, the OP Stack & Governance framework. This common set of tools simplifies development and streamlines governance processes for L2s within the Superchain.
In April 2024, Base demonstrated its commitment to the Superchain by paying $1.86 million in Superchain membership fees to Optimism. This financial contribution helps to ensure the ongoing development and maintenance of the Superchain.
Source: X
However, there were some concerns that arose when it was seen that Base had a higher number of monthly active users than the OP mainnet. In fact, Token Terminal’s data indicated that despite having a higher number of monthly active users, Base doesn’t necessarily undermine OP Mainnet’s position within the Optimism Superchain.
OP Mainnet can retain its role as the Superchain’s Hub by providing a shared governance framework for all member chains. Strong performance by individual member chains, like Base, can be beneficial for the entire ecosystem. This, because high-performing chains contribute more fees back to OP, further supporting the Superchain’s development.
How is OP doing?
Despite Optimism network’s progress, overall interest in the OP token declined. Additionally, the price of OP has fallen by 5.59% in just 24 hours. At press time, OP was trading at $2.96. The volume at which OP was trading also fell by 22.75%.

 Realistic or not, here’s OP market cap in BTC’s terms

Also, network growth around the OP token declined significantly, indicating that the number of new addresses showing interest in OP fell.
If the waning interest from new addresses continues, the price of OP could see a correction in the near future.

Jack Dorsey makes $21m commitment to Bitcoin and open source | Cryptopolitan

Jack Dorsey, the guy behind Twitter, just threw a massive $21 million towards OpenSats. This money is meant for pushing forward with open source and Bitcoin development. As we all know, Dorsey is big on Bitcoin, seeing it as a revolutionary financial instrument. I mean:“Bitcoin changes absolutely everything. I don’t think there is anything more important in my lifetime to work on.“Jack DorseyOpenSats said they got this cash in May 2023. It’s part of Dorsey’s giving nature through his #startsmall thing, which had already put $10 million into their coffers for similar projects, including something called Nostr, which is all about decentralized social media. Money Where It MattersThe breakdown of this $21 million Dorsey donation is pretty strategic: $15 million is going straight into the General Fund, another $5 million is earmarked for The Nostr Fund, and a cool $1 million is for operational costs. This isn’t just throwing money around; it’s about fuelling ongoing and new stuff that makes a difference in the Bitcoin space and the broader arena of tech that lets people do what they want without interference.Recently, Nostr got a huge boost. We’re talking about integrating Bitcoin payments for developers, which has sparked a user surge to 16 million, with 500,000 folks logging in daily. That’s not small potatoes.With all this cash flooding in, OpenSats didn’t just sit on it. They’ve brought in new brains and brawn to their committee and board. Now, there’s a user named @Fiatjaf and another, NVK, who are eyeing future projects. NVK, along with Gigi, is also stepping up on the board. This squad is about creating a space where open-source software can thrive, keeping digital big brother at bay, as OpenSats put it—they’re fighting “digital totalitarianism.”A Look at Past EffortsOpenSats isn’t new to this game. They’ve been backing projects that sync with their mission to beef up the Bitcoin ecosystem and other open-source ventures. Before this latest cash infusion, they had already supported 21 teams, like the Bitcoin Policy Institute and the BTCPay Server, which is a DIY payment processor. They’ve handed out nearly $10 million in grants to over 100 grantees.This time around, Dorsey’s money is also setting aside some for legal defense funds, helping Bitcoin developers who might get into legal scraps over their work. While they’re keeping the details under wraps, it’s clear that Dorsey’s backing isn’t about the money, but rather having the backs of those in the trenches of Bitcoin development.It’s not just Dorsey who’s into OpenSats. The group has been pulling in donations from the public and other philanthropic bodies. The Reynolds Foundation also kicked in $1 million last month. OpenSats is all about getting more folks to chip in, helping push high-impact projects across the tech world.So here’s the deal. Last year, Dorsey already handed over $10 million to OpenSats, and now, with another $21 million, he’s keeping his position as a major player in the movement towards more open, free tech infrastructure.OpenSats has a lot on its plate, but with financial injections like these and a clear focus on impactful projects, they’re set to keep the momentum going. Remember, this is about shaping a future where technology enhances freedom rather than restricts it. Dorsey and OpenSats are on a mission to make sure that future comes to pass, with Bitcoin right in the middle of it.

2 Reasons Why Polygon (MATIC) Could Enter a Bull Rally


Polygon (MATIC) price awaits strong bullish cues that could propel the altcoin out of the consolidation it is currently stuck in.
Given that the altcoin is among the lowest profit-bearing assets, it is likely that investors will push for a price rise to book profits.
Polygon Investors Hint at Accumulation
MATIC price could see a breakout above the $0.74 barrier if only investors act accordingly. As long as these MATIC holders refrain from selling, consolidation could continue, and accumulation could enable an upswing.
This is the likely outcome for MATIC’s price, which is observing a surge in buying pressures. The supply held on the exchanges has seen a 20 million MATIC decline in the last three days. Although compared to other values and market capitalization of the altcoin, this supply is not much, it is a testament to the investors’ sentiment.

In the past, such instances of buying have been followed by short-term price spikes. If MATIC price witnesses the same outcome this time, it could invalidate the consolidation.
MATIC Exchange Supply. Source: Santiment
Less than 34% of the entire circulating supply of MATIC is in profits, which is relatively uncommon. Despite the recent corrections, at least 50% of most of the cryptocurrency supply is in profit.
This suggests that Polygon investors are likely desperate for profits, which could keep them from selling their holdings. Since MATIC has considerable room to grow, it could also witness extended bullishness.

MATIC Price Prediction: Reclaim $0.80 
MATIC price is consolidated between $0.74 and $0.64. This range has been unbroken on both ends for the past three weeks. Since mid-April, the Polygon native token has attempted multiple times to breach the upper limit, acting as resistance. 
Now, the altcoin is close to doing the same this time around. A push from Polygon investors’ accumulation could help MATIC breach $0.74, pushing it towards $0.80. Successfully flipping the resistance of $0.81 would initiate a recovery rally.

On the other hand, if the breach fails, MATIC’s price could remain rangebound and slip back down to $0.64. Losing this support could send the altcoin to $0.60 and lower, invalidating the bullish outlook.

5 Solana Memecoins That Will Skyrocket Over 9,000%, Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Ripple's XRP Can Avoid Another Price Dip Under One Condition


Ripple (XRP) price recovery rally largely depends on the broader crypto market and the investors’ behavior.
However, neither party favors a price rise, which could cause considerable damage to XRP holders.
Ripple Investors Take a Step Back
XRP price attempts to move upward, but by the looks of it, this effort will be thwarted. This is because Ripple is noting bearishness at the hands of its investors, particularly traders.
Bearish bets against XRP have increased in the futures market, which is evident from the funding rate. 

The funding rate in cryptocurrency futures trading is the fee paid or received by traders holding leveraged positions overnight. Market conditions determine it and serve to balance the market between long and short positions. Generally, positive funding rates suggest the dominance of long contracts, whereas negative rates hint at short contracts’ taking the preference. 
XRP is witnessing negative funding rates, which suggests traders are betting on a price decline.

At the same time, the broader market is also exhibiting bearishness, as can be seen in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movement. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in an asset.
Given that XRP is struggling to secure the neutral line at 50 as support, a bearish outcome seems rather likely.

XRP Price Prediction: Another Dip
XRP price trading at $0.51 notes a potential breakout of the symmetrical triangle pattern in effect since early April. 
A symmetrical triangle pattern is a technical analysis formation characterized by converging trendlines. It indicates a period of consolidation before a potential breakout. It typically signifies indecision in the market and can lead to a bullish or bearish move. 
Considering the aforementioned conditions, the chances are that the XRP price could face a bearish move, which could bring it down to $0.47. Falling through this support will extend the losses by a mile toward $0.42.

On the other hand, flipping $0.51 into a support floor can represent a significant milestone. Indeed, it will enable the altcoin to invalidate the bearish thesis and allow the XRP price to eventually secure a 27% rally to hit the target of $0.65, as derived from the triangle pattern.

Michael Saylor warns these popular cryptocurrencies will be deemed securities


Michael Saylor, founder of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) and a prominent Bitcoin (BTC) advocate, recently stated that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is likely to classify major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) as securities, not commodities. He anticipates that this classification will result in the denial of all spot Ethereum ETF applications this summer.
Saylor’s comments extended beyond Ethereum, predicting a similar future for other prominent cryptocurrencies such as Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA). This announcement was made during his speech at the MicroStrategy World 2024 conference on Thursday.

“Ethereum is deemed to be a crypto asset security, not a commodity. After that, you’re gonna see that Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano, everything down the stack is just crypto-asset securities unregistered”



Michael Saylor on BNB, SOL, and XRP ETFs
His remarks reflect a broader skepticism about the potential for these assets to gain mainstream financial products such as spot ETFs, which are often seen as a bridge to institutional investment. 
“None of these tokens will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will be accepted by Wall Street, none of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets,” Saylor added.
Contrasting sharply with his views on Ethereum and others, Saylor reaffirmed Bitcoin’s status as the premier cryptocurrency, uniquely recognized as an institutional-grade asset.
According to Saylor, Bitcoin stands as the “one universal” crypto asset that has achieved full institutional acceptance. This distinction highlights the potential for Bitcoin to remain largely unaffected by the regulatory challenges that might beset other cryptocurrencies.
Diminishing prospects for Ethereum ETF
The prospects for an Ethereum ETF are currently bleak, as evidenced by recent developments and expert opinions. 
Justin Sun, the CEO of Tron (TRX), voiced a similar sentiment regarding the challenges ahead for Ethereum’s acceptance by regulators, emphasizing the need for “long-term education with regulators.” 

This aligns with the cautious stance of the SEC, which recently postponed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot Ethereum ETF to June 11, 2024.
James Seyffart, an analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence, also indicated skepticism, noting that the current batch of Ether ETF applications might ultimately be rejected.
The public comment period initiated by the SEC in April, seeking opinions on proposals from various firms, including Bitwise Ethereum Trust and Fidelity Ethereum Fund, further underscores the regulatory uncertainties surrounding Ethereum.
Despite the prevailing pessimistic outlook, some industry figures like Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, remain optimistic. Fink suggested that an Ethereum ETF might still be feasible even if ETH is classified as a security, with BlackRock actively exploring the possibility of launching such a product.

The forthcoming SEC decision on May 23, which includes considerations for VanEck’s ETF proposal among others, will be crucial in determining the future landscape for Ethereum and potentially setting a precedent for how other cryptocurrencies are perceived and regulated.

Why Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price May Drop This Weekend


Shiba Inu (SHIB) is threatened to note a decline due to the lack of recovery observed in the broader market cues.
SHIB investors are not keenly bullish either, which could translate into losses for the meme coin.
Shiba Inu Whales Are a Problem
Shiba Inu’s price could experience a price correction due to the waning support from SHIB holders. These meme coin enthusiasts have been losing optimism toward a rally, which is visible in their increasing selling pressure.
In the last two months, the addresses holding more than $1 million and $10 million worth of SHIB have sold off a huge chunk of their supply. Nearly $10 billion worth of SHIB has left their wallets, creating a bearish impact on the meme coin.

Such major selling tends to counter any potential an asset has at rallying, which could be the case with Shiba Inu.

Furthermore, the correlation this meme coin shares with Bitcoin also threatens its gains. SHIB shares a high correlation of 0.81 with BTC. A high correlation indicates a strong statistical relationship between the two assets. This implies that changes in one of them are closely associated with changes in the other.
Given Bitcoin is the bigger asset and is also noting bearish cues, it is difficult to predict a bullish outcome for Shiba Inu. Thus, there is a good chance that the meme coin could have a bearish weekend.

SHIB Price Prediction: Support Could Fail
Shiba Inu’s price has been trading under a downward trendline for the most part since the beginning of March. Even though the meme coin attempted breakouts in the past, it failed to retain the rally.
Consequently, SHIB is now threatened to fail the breach of the downtrend line and fall back to $0.00002093. Losing this support would result in a significant correction to $0.00001491.

Shina Inu must print a daily candlestick close above $0.00002584 to invalidate the bearish thesis. Such upward movement could break the descending trendline SHIB has maintained since March and push prices toward $0.00002835 or higher.

Is the lack of liquidity in Bitcoin futures threatening price stability? | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin surged to $64,500 on May 4, with out-of-hours trading pushing it to new local highs of $64,522 on Bitstamp. This marked a significant recovery for the cryptocurrency, hitting its peak for May.Daily Market MovementsData from TradingView confirmed the spike, which rode on positive U.S. employment data and signals of crypto market recovery, notably the first cash inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in almost three months. Currently, Bitcoin’s price is up 5% for the month, starkly contrasting with a 15% drop experienced in April, according to CoinGlass.On Twitter, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades shared, “Had a great push into the market close yesterday.” He added, “I like how the charts are on the higher timeframes, but I’ll be patient and won’t start buying just because it’s green this weekend. We’ll see how it goes.”This weekend’s market did show some unexpected moves. There was a notable difference between the Bitcoin prices on spot markets and the closing prices of Bitcoin futures by CME Group, revealing a “gap” that tends to close later.Source: Daan CryptoMarket VulnerabilitiesHowever, some market watchers are skeptical about the rally’s strength, pointing out the lack of traditional finance (TradFi) involvement. Keith Alan from Material Indicators commented on the fragility of the market due to thin liquidity in the order books. “We need more bid liquidity to sustain this rally,” he said, warning that “it wouldn’t take much to trigger a sell-off through this thin liquidity.”Credible Crypto, another prominent voice, noted that the market setup might favor short sellers under certain conditions. “If we stay below the main resistance around $69,000, going short could be a good strategy,” he mentioned in a post, sharing a chart that predicted two potential paths for Bitcoin’s price.“The ideal path is we keep the gains we’ve made and push towards major resistance. That lets me set up shorts for several altcoins. The less ideal path is we drop these gains early, and I miss the short zones I’m watching,” he explained.Credible Crypto also pointed out that buying opportunities could arise if Bitcoin falls below $56,000, indicating a strategy to capitalize on potential dips.Institutional Engagement in BitcoinThe ongoing submissions of 13F filings are shedding light on institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Institutions managing over $100 million must disclose their quarterly holdings, and these filings have shown varied levels of engagement.BNY Mellon reported owning nearly 20,000 shares of the IBIT and about 7,000 shares of GBTC. In contrast, BNP Paribas holds around 1,000 shares of IBIT, indicating a more cautious stance.More aggressive positions are seen in smaller firms. Pittsburgh-based Quattro Advisors owns 468,200 shares of BlackRock’s ETF, while Legacy Wealth Management disclosed ownership of over 350,000 shares of Fidelity’s ETF. A significant stakeholder is Yong Rong, holding over a million shares of BlackRock’s ETF, making it a major part of their portfolio.Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas highlighted that Yong Rong is among several Hong Kong asset managers heavily investing in Bitcoin ETFs, including Fidelity, Grayscale, and Bitwise, alongside IBIT.

Bitcoin Surges Past $64,000 as Altcoins Seek Recovery Amidst Weekend Momentum



                    

Bitcoin surged past $64,000 before the weekly close on April 28, while altcoins aimed for a rebound. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed increased momentum in Bitcoin’s price over the weekend. 



After hitting a weekly low of $62,400, BTC/USD reversed its course and maintained levels around $63,500 at the time of reporting. 




Altcoins also saw positive performance during off-hours trading, with the total altcoin market cap rising by approximately 1% for the day.



Popular trader Skew, commenting on recent market trends, noted the bounce in altcoins but expressed caution regarding their tendency to peak early in the week. 



Skew anticipated sell-side pressure on Bitcoin around its range highs, which could hinder further bullish advances.




Trader and commentator Moustache expressed optimism about an upcoming “altseason,” suggesting it could rival the market’s performance during the 2017 all-time highs.

He pointed to the monthly dominance chart of the stablecoin Tether, indicating a potential “backtest” after breaking below a rising trendline earlier in the year.



Market participants awaited the introduction of “TradFi” trading, such as Bitcoin futures, for additional insights into the crypto market’s trajectory. 




Fellow trader Daan Crypto Trades shared positive sentiments about weekend price action, anticipating limited movement in Bitcoin until after the reopening of CME.



Despite consolidating below previous all-time highs, Bitcoin’s monthly chart drew optimism from trader Alan Tardigrade. 



Tardigrade highlighted Bitcoin’s position above the Triangle Top on the monthly chart as a bullish indicator, emphasizing the necessity of consolidation for a sustained bull run in the future. 



He compared Bitcoin’s current situation to the pre-breakout period of the Nasdaq Composite Index in 2013, suggesting potential for significant growth ahead.

Short squeeze alert for May: 2 cryptocurrencies with skyrocketing potential


The cryptocurrency market shifted from bearish to bullish as the week ended, following nonfarm payroll data reported on May 3. After days of continuous short-selling pressure, some cryptocurrencies display skyrocketing potential within the possibility of a short squeeze.
Notably, TradingView‘s total crypto market cap index surged by over $277 billion month-to-date from a local bottom on May 1. On May 4, the index reached a $2.318 trillion capitalization local high, up over 13% in three days.

However, previous fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) led cryptocurrency traders to massively short Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies. Thus, this increases the likelihood of short-squeeze events for BTC and targets higher prices, as reported by Finbold on May 3.


In addition, Finbold spotted two cryptocurrencies in a similar situation, with negative funding rates and accumulated short-position liquidations.
Short squeeze alert for BNB Chain (BNB)
The BNB Chain’s (BNB) current funding rate is the leading signal for a potential short squeeze to Binance‘s native token. We retrieved this data on May 4 from the CoinGlass 30-day funding rate heatmap.
In particular, BNB short-sellers are paying a 32.63% APR for long-position traders, which could fuel short liquidations. The BNB Chain has the sixth-largest open interest in the derivatives market, increasing this signal’s relevancy.

As for the price targets, BNB has short-position liquidity pools from $600 to $630, currently trading slightly below this level.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has an even higher negative funding rate of 35.96%, the 10th-largest cryptocurrency ordered by open interest.

While BCH’s liquidity pools are less concentrated than BNB’s, the coin’s current price is far below the pending liquidations. Interestingly, there are unbalances in a large range from $500 to above $700. This offers a skyrocketing potential that could result in over 40% gains if Bitcoin Cash suffers a short squeeze.

However, despite the above economic analysis, these cryptocurrencies could still display negative price performance in the next few days. Short squeeze technical indicators do not guarantee the event will happen. Things can quickly change as the market moves, so investors must remain cautious.

Here Are The Top 10 Altcoin Networks With The Most Users In April - Ethereum Ranks 6th - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the cryptocurrency market rose led by Bitcoin after the weak employment report from the USA, analysis company CryptoRank identified the altcoin networks with the highest number of users in April.
Bitcoin price has increased by approximately 7% in the last 24 hours and is traded at $ 63,257 at the time of writing this article.


Here are the altcoin networks with the most users and their number of users in April:

Tron (TRX) – 54.7 million
Near (NEAR) – 53.8 million
BNB (BNB) – 35.5 million
Solana (SOL) – 35.2 million
Polygon (MATIC) – 33.6 million
Ethereum (ETH) 12 million
Base – 10.7 million
zkSync Era – 9.8 million
Arbitrum (ARB) – 9.3 million
Linea – 5.6 million
Celo (CELO) – 4.9 million
Optimism (OP) – 4.2 million
Aptos (APT) – 3.2 million
Scroll – 2.6 million
Blast – 2.5 million


It is noteworthy that Ethereum, which has the largest market value, can rank sixth on the list. The reason why Ethereum's number of users remains lower than others is the high transaction fees required by the network to process transactions.





However, it is thought that the reason why Tron, which ranks first, has such a large number of users is that most of the USDT stablecoin transfers occur on the Tron network.

BTC-e crypto exchange operator pleads guilty to money laundering in the U.S.

Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national who operated the crypto exchange BTC-e, pled guilty to charges of money laundering conspiracy in the US on May 3, according to a Bloomberg report.BTC-e was one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges between 2011 and 2017. According to the prosecutors, it processed transactions worth $9 billion and had a customer base of over 1 million worldwide.The prosecutors added that BTC-e was used by cyber criminals to transfer, launder, and store criminal proceeds from illegal activities. This included proceeds from hacking, ransomware, and narcotics distribution.According to a statement by the US Attorney’s office in San Francisco, Vinnik operated the exchange until he was arrested and BTC-e was shut down by law enforcement. Vinnik, sentenced to five years imprisonment for money laundering in France in 2020, faces a maximum of 20 years in prison in the U.S.The statement noted:“Vinnik operated BTC-e with the intent to promote these unlawful activities and was responsible for a loss amount of at least $121 million.”Prosecutors claim that BTC-e did not have a vetting system and allowed criminals to convert illicit cash into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin anonymously. The prosecutors stated that the exchange was found to have handled Bitcoin traced to a Russian military intelligence hacking unit that was responsible for releasing Democrats’ emails during the 2016 U.S. elections in an attempt to sway votes.In recent months, there has been increasing scrutiny and regulatory action against cryptocurrency-related fraud in the U.S. Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder of now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, was sentenced to 24 years in prison in March for orchestrating a multi-billion dollar fraud scheme.Additionally, Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs, was found liable for fraud in a civil case in April 2024. Terraform Labs collapsed in 2022, triggering a chain of bankruptcies and wiping out $40 billion from the market.More recently, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the founder of Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, was sentenced to four months in prison this week for failures that allowed illicit activities, including criminal and terrorist financing, to occur on the platform. CZ had previously pled guilty while Binance paid the biggest fine in history and agreed to being monitored.Furthermore, Former SEC Division of Enforcement Assistant Director Jennifer Lee said this week that if Donald Trump is elected President for a second term this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will continue to “define its space and reach over crypto.”Mentioned in this article

Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin’s price shows a robust ascent, now trading at approximately $63,200, with recent highs of $64,446. This activity is part of a wider trend that has seen the global crypto market cap increase to $2.36 trillion, up over 7% over the last day.
The uptick is influenced by the Federal Reserve’s decision, as indicated by Chair Jerome Powell, to halt further interest rate increases, a policy move that often favors investments like Bitcoin by enhancing their appeal.
The surge is also supported by significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and the successful launch of similar products in Hong Kong, highlighting a renewed and growing confidence among investors.
The combination of these factors indicates a possible increase in the price of Bitcoin.





Bitcoin ETFs See $378M Inflows, Marking Market Confidence Resurgence

Bitcoin ETFs have recently witnessed a notable surge in inflows, totaling $378 million on May 3, marking a recovery after a week of outflows.
This influx includes a significant $63 million investment in Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF (GBTC), its first since January. This is notable considering Grayscale’s previous $17.5 billion loss attributed to higher fees compared to competitors.


Other prominent Bitcoin ETFs, like Fidelity’s FBTC and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, also reported significant inflows.

Grayscale’s Surprise Recovery: GBTC secures $63 million, reversing previous declines.
Market Recovery: Indicators suggest rising institutional confidence and potential positive impacts on Bitcoin’s price.

These inflows reflect a renewed confidence in the crypto market, potentially signalling a broader recovery and rising demand for Bitcoin.
Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs Attract $258M, Fueling BTC Price Surge and Market Stability

Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs have made a remarkable entrance, attracting $258 million in just three days of trading. This surge in capital inflows highlights a growing investor appetite for Bitcoin and underscores the strength of Hong Kong’s crypto market, especially compared to the global landscape.
While the US Spot Bitcoin ETF market experienced $860 million in outflows, Hong Kong’s market saw nearly $300 million in inflows, demonstrating its robustness during global market volatility.
This financial dynamism coincided with a 5.75% increase in Bitcoin’s price to $63,050.11, showcasing the market’s resilience.

Rapid Growth: Hong Kong ETFs quickly gathered $258 million, indicating strong investor confidence.
Market Contrast: Outshines US market dynamics with substantial weekly inflows.

The significant interest in Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs likely played a pivotal role in the recent BTC price uptick, reinforcing positive market sentiment amid broader economic uncertainty.








The technical outlook suggests a bullish Bitcoin price prediction, as BTC is holding around a pivotal price point of $61,651. Ascending beyond this mark, Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $64,565, with further resistance anticipated at $67,085 and $70,000.Conversely, if Bitcoin’s price falls, it encounters immediate support at $59,165, with subsequent levels at $56,675 and $54,335 poised to offer further stability.Recent trends on the 4-hour chart show Bitcoin surpassing the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $61,575, transitioning it from a resistance to a support level.As discussed in the morning story on Bitcoin price prediction, the ‘three white soldiers’ candlestick pattern suggests strong bullish momentum. Nonetheless, a resistance near $63,200 could temper the ascent, demanding a breakthrough for further gains.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewShould Bitcoin overcome this barrier, it is likely to challenge the next resistance at $64,564 promptly.Overcoming this could thrust Bitcoin towards $67,084 and potentially reach as high as $70,000, especially if it surpasses a distinct double-top pattern near $67,000.Supporting this bullish scenario is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 63, signaling robust buying interest.Technical Indicators:
RSI: 63, reflects strong buying pressure.
50 EMA: $61,574, now provides support.
With these dynamics, Bitcoin’s prospects appear favourable above the $61,650 pivot. Remaining above this level could lead Bitcoin to test upper resistances. However, slipping below could trigger significant sell-offs, targeting lower support levels as the market reassesses its direction.Secure Early Advantages with the 99Bitcoins Presale

Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) to Surge 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kitty With Hat (KITHAT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KITHAT will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kitty With Hat.



Currently, Kitty With Hat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KITHAT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – 3Wdkgv1iTBQQ9MnvA4TkAefe2SLdtSKfHwZbhKcEMZk8 – in the receiving field.




KITHAT currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Venture Capitalists Funnel Nearly $2,500,000,000 Into Crypto in Q1 of 2024: Galaxy Research - The Daily Hodl


								New data from crypto insights firm Galaxy Research finds that during the first quarter of the year, venture capitalists poured in billions of dollars into the digital assets industry.
In a new article, Galaxy Research says that venture capitalists invested $2.49 billion into cryptocurrencies during Q1 of 2024, a 29% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) rise.










The analytics platform says that heavy investments during Q1 of 2024 signal that Q4 of 2023 could have been the bottom of the market.
“In Q1 2024, venture capitalists invested $2.49 billion (+29% QoQ) into crypto and blockchain-focused companies across 603 deals (+68% QoQ). 
This was the first rise in both capital invested and deal count in three quarters, perhaps signaling that Q4 2023 was the ‘bottom,’ although a continuation of QoQ increases – and a more meaningful increase – would confirm that over the coming quarters.”
Source: Galaxy Research
Galaxy Research goes on to note that while venture capitalist investments into the crypto space have correlated with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) in the past, the crypto king’s massive rise in 2024 caused them to decouple.
 “While venture capital investment in the crypto sector has typically correlated to the Bitcoin price, that correlation has broken down over the past year, with bitcoin rising significantly since January 2023 but VC activity mostly languishing. 
Q1 2024 saw a significant rise in BTC, and while capital invested also rose, the investment activity is still nowhere near the levels when Bitcoin last traded over $60,000. 
The combination of crypto industry-native catalysts (Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, new areas like restaking, modularity, Bitcoin layer-2s, etc.) and macro headwinds (rates) contributed to the notable divergence.”

Bitcoin is trading for $62,754 at time of writing, a 5.2% increase during the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin's present price volatility points to the ETF mania

Bitcoin seems to be aligning with the viewpoints of traditional investors who have entered the digital asset space via the introduction of US exchange-traded funds. Furthermore, the price of BTC surged to $64,500 on May 4 due to fresh gains in out-of-hours trading.Bitcoin Wild West pricesThe largest crypto experienced a surge on Friday following a report that revealed a smaller-than-expected rise in US employment. This news has reignited expectations for interest rate cuts, which in turn has increased the attractiveness of speculative assets. The rally managed to recover a significant portion of the losses experienced earlier in the week due to increasing worries about the Federal Reserve officials adopting a more hawkish stance and a decrease in demand for the ETFs.Bitcoin experienced a significant 7% increase on Friday, reaching a price of $62,937. This upward movement also had a positive impact on other cryptocurrencies, including Ether, Solana, and even meme-based coins like Dogecoin. Bitcoin experienced a significant decline on May 1, reaching its lowest point in approximately two months at $56,527.On Wednesday, a significant amount of money, totaling $564 million, was withdrawn by investors from a group of nearly a dozen US ETFs. This marked the largest outflow of funds since these products were introduced in January. Higher-for-longer interest rates have also had a negative impact on other markets, such as equities.The drop in Bitcoin from the record of almost $74,000 reached in March has raised concerns among traders. According to some market analysts, some traders may perceive risks in the global macro environment that the Fed or general investors have not yet recognized.Bitcoin price movementCurrently, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) stands at $63,571.91. This represents a slight decrease of 0.2% compared to an hour ago, but a notable increase of 2.9% since yesterday. The current value of BTC is 1.0% higher than its value a week ago.The current global crypto market cap stands at $2.47 Trillion, with a 2.42% change in the last 24 hours and a significant 100.47% change compared to one year ago. Currently, BTC’s market capi stands at $1.25 Trillion, indicating a Bitcoin dominance of 50.63%. Meanwhile, the market cap of Stablecoins stands at $161 Billion, accounting for 6.51% of the total crypto market cap.The strength seen in the United States employment data gained momentum towards the end of the day, driven by positive signs of recovery in the crypto market, such as the recent inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) after a gap of almost three months.According to data from monitoring resource CoinGlass, BTC/USD has seen a 5% increase month-to-date at the time of writing, which is a significant improvement compared to the 15% losses in April.Despite the impressive weekend performance, there were concerns about the overall strength of the market without the participation of traditional financial institutions.One X user said, “Two main scenarios I am looking out for on $BTC at the moment. Green path is ideal. We hold the local highs we broke above and continue up to the major resistance. This will allow me to fill shorts on a number of alts across the board.”He ended by saying, “Red path is not ideal. We fail to hold this reclaim, see an “early” breakdown, and ideal short zones for most alts I’m eyeing up are not met.”

Vodafone looks to integrate crypto wallets with sim cards

Vodafone, a United Kingdom-based telecommunications provider, hopes to bring blockchain technology to smartphone users by integrating cryptocurrency wallets with subscriber identity module (SIM) cards. The ambitious move comes amid a company finance plan that reportedly involves Vodafone Idea Ltd., a separate entity operating in India that Vodafone Group carries a 45% stake in, taking on nearly $3 billion in debt including $1.8 billion in loans over the next two years. In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance Future Focus, Vodafone Blockchain Lead David Palmer discussed the company’s plans to integrate blockchain technology into smartphone sim cards:“By 2030 we’re expecting more than 20 billion mobile phones to be in operation, many of those being smartphones. … So we’ve focused on linking the sim card to digital identity, linking the sim card to blockchains, and using the cryptography we have in those sim cards for that integration.” Palmer elaborated on the figures he presented, stating that he expected there to be some eight billion smartphones in use by 2030 and predicting a surge in crypto wallets to 5.6 billion in the same time frame — enough to account for nearly 70 percent of all people on Earth.Despite the financial wrangling occurring with India-based Vodafone Idea Ltd, which recently sold off $2.2 billion worth of shares ahead of a debt raising plan worth a reported $3 billion, Vodafone Group has had a busy 2024. As Cointelegraph recently reported, the company entered into a 10-year strategic partnership with Microsoft to bring generative artificial intelligence (AI) services to Vodafone’s customers. Upon announcing the deal, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took the opportunity to hawk the disruptive nature of his company’s AI technologies declaring that the “new generation of AI will unlock massive new opportunities for every organization and every industry around the world.”This isn’t the first time a company’s worked to combine cell phone technology with blockchain hardware. Back in 2019, U.S. startup VaultTel announced its ambitions to create a physical wallet that could be slotted into a smartphone's SIM slot.Related: Vodafone auctions world’s first SMS 'Merry Christmas' as NFT for charity

Ethereum Bounces Back Strongly After $2,871 Support Rejection | Bitcoinist.com


								On Wednesday, ETH, the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain experienced a significant rejection at the resistance level of $2,871. Since this rejection, the price of Ethereum has gained a significant upward movement of over 9% and showing signs of even moving further.
At the time of writing, the price is still showing strong signs of moving upward toward the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the trendline, both in the 4-hour and the 1-day timeframe. The price of ETH is currently trading around $3,116 and about 0.47% up in the last 24 hours.
A Further Look At The Ethereum Chart With The Following Technical Indicators
100-Day Moving Average and Trendline: As seen in the image below, although the price of ETH is currently moving toward the 100-day simple moving average and the trendline, it is still trading below these two indicators. This means at a certain point, the price of Ethereum could make a possible reversal and continue in its movement toward the downside.

The RSI Indicator: Also observing the chart with the help of the Relative Strength Index Indication (RSI), it shows that the RSI signal line is trending above the 50 line which strongly indicates that the price might still move upward, as seen in the chart.
The 4-Hour MACD Indicator: After a close look at the MACD indicator in the 4-hour timeframe, it can be seen that the MACD histogram has moved above the zero line. Also, the MACD line and the signal line have crossed and are heading toward the zero line. This suggests there may be sustained upward price movement until a potential reversal.
Final Thought On ETH Movement
Based on Ethereum’s previous movement, there are two resistance levels of $3,250 and $3,355, and a support level of $2,819. As the price of Ethereum is moving upward, if it manages to break above the resistance level of $3,250, it might continue to move even further toward the $3,355 resistance level. 
On the contrary, if Ethereum fails to break its previous resistance level, it might reserve and start a move downward toward its previous support level of  $2,819. Should ETH succeed in breaching this level of support, it may descend even further to establish a new low.

US Crackdown Prompts Acinq and zkSNACKs to Discontinue Services for American Crypto Users



                    

Amidst a recent crackdown on self-custodial cryptocurrency wallet providers by U.S. regulatory agencies targeting major players like Consensys and Samourai Wallet, Acinq’s Phoenix Wallet and zkSNACKs’ Wasabi Wallet have made the decision to discontinue services for customers based in the United States.



Expressing concerns over the legitimacy of self-custodial wallet providers as money service businesses in the wake of regulatory actions, both Acinq and zkSNACKs have taken steps to restrict access for U.S. users.




“In light of recent announcements by U.S. authorities, zkSNACKs is now strictly prohibiting U.S. users from using its services,” stated zkSNACKs in an April 27 release.



Similarly, Acinq highlighted uncertainties regarding the regulatory landscape in an April 26 post, explaining, “Recent announcements from US authorities cast a doubt on whether self-custodial wallet providers, Lightning service providers, or even Lightning nodes could be considered Money Services Businesses and be regulated as such.”



Acinq has set a deadline of May 2 for Phoenix Wallet users to adapt to the impending changes, while Wasabi Wallet’s new policy was immediately put into effect.

Advising Phoenix Wallet users to empty their wallets without force-closing them to avoid significant on-chain fees, Acinq provided guidance for the transition period.



Regulators worldwide have voiced concerns that self-custody crypto wallets might facilitate illicit activities like money laundering. 



This sentiment was underscored by recent actions taken against Consensys and Samourai Wallet.




Consensys received a Wells notice from the SEC, signaling potential enforcement actions related to its MetaMask products, while the co-founders of Samourai Wallet face charges of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business brought by the U.S. Justice Department.



In contrast, European regulators have taken a more relaxed stance on potential regulations concerning self-custody wallets. 



Scrapping a proposed 1,000 euro limit on crypto payments from self-hosted wallets, European Parliament’s lead committees emphasized the importance of due diligence measures by crypto exchanges for transactions exceeding this threshold.

Crypto startups see rapid growth through 'fluid valuations' and decentralized cap tables â Bloomberg - Crypto Briefing




Cryptocurrency startups are increasingly adopting an aggressive form of fundraising known as open-ended or rolling funding rounds.This approach allows startups to continuously raise capital and rapidly boost their valuations, in contrast to the traditional venture capital model of discrete funding rounds spaced over several years.According to a report from Bloomberg, the rise of open-ended funding rounds in the crypto industry reflects both the sector’s recovery from the 2022 bear market and venture funds’ desire to deploy previously static cash.With this fundraising model, earlier investors benefit from the rapid increase in a startup’s valuation driven by commitments from later backers.While some investors and industry experts view these “fluid valuations” as perplexing and potentially lacking in fundamental drivers, the report claims that the traditional approach to venture capital formation may not be suited to digital-asset companies.“Capital formation in crypto is always evolving — governance, liquidity, and other important concepts that we’ve figured out in traditional startups are often a little different,” said Matt Luongo, chief executive at Thesis.Thesis is a venture studio, which helped develop and launch Mezo, a Bitcoin L2 protocol designed as an economic layer. Ed Roman, managing partner at Hack VC, noted that crypto startups generally prefer “decentralized cap tables” to help with governance, making the traditional priced rounds with a single, large, lead investor less suitable.Michael Heinrich, co-founder of 0G Labs, a blockchain startup focused on decentralized and modular artificial intelligence, noted that this type of structure is becoming more common when a deal is highly oversubscribed.“Investors are still willing to pay higher prices because it is seen as a signal of market success, even if in rapid succession,” Heinrich said.0G Labs itself raised $35 million in March through a rolling fundraise, with offers exceeding its planned raise by 20 times. The company’s valuation ranged from less than $40 million to hundreds of millions of dollars, depending on the investor.According to data from The Block Research as cited by Bloomberg, the average Series A round in crypto reached $26 million in the first quarter of 2024, the highest since early 2022. Overall venture investment in the sector increased to $2.5 billion during the same quarter.

Bitfinex users' personal information about to be leaked | Cryptopolitan

Recent unsettling news has erupted around Bitfinex, as the notorious ransomware group FSociety claims they have hijacked 2.5TB of data from the cryptocurrency exchange. They assert possession of not just trading data but also the personal details of 400,000 users.What’s more terrifying? They’re threatening to leak KYC (Know Your Customer) information of every user unless their demands are met. This alarming situation has sent waves of concern throughout the crypto community.Initial Leak DetailsFSociety has taken to the dark web, specifically their onion site, to broadcast their claim. They’ve even posted links to text files that supposedly contain a chunk of usernames alongside plaintext passwords. Interestingly, after scouring the list, some Bitfinex account holders, including individuals associated with major trading firms like Alameda Research, have reported that their details do not appear in the leaked data.The hackers have thrown down the gauntlet, stating that if their undisclosed requirements aren’t fulfilled, they will dump the KYC documentation for all users. The sheer volume of data they claim to possess suggests that they could potentially have every KYC record since Bitfinex’s inception.A deep dive into the leaked data reveals numerous email domains, predominantly public ones such as Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook, among a long list of others. A peculiar standout in the list is coinfarm.co.za, which could hint at targeted trimming of more sensitive or valuable accounts from the bulk data.Community Reactions and Official ResponseThe leak’s authenticity was inadvertently tested when an individual tried one of the passwords from the file, only to be met with a prompt for two-factor authentication—suggesting the data might be genuine. Adding to the chaos, Bitfinex’s CTO, Paolo Ardoino, has been tagged in ongoing discussions to address these claims.In response, Ardoino expressed skepticism regarding the breach’s origin, suggesting that the data might have been gathered from other sources rather than from Bitfinex itself. He mentioned that out of the 22.5k email-password pairs posted, only about 5k match Bitfinex accounts, which would be unlikely if the data were directly from their databases. Ardoino also pointed out that Bitfinex was never contacted by the hackers, which contradicts typical ransomware protocol where hackers would reach out to negotiate.Despite the lack of direct extortion attempts towards Bitfinex, the hackers have made the compromised data freely downloadable. This unorthodox approach has led to speculation that the true motive might be less about a direct ransom and more about promoting some dubious investment linked to the data breach publicity.Implications and Ongoing InvestigationsThe unfolding situation raises numerous red flags concerning digital security in the cryptocurrency landscape. Notably, Ardoino has reassured the community that an extensive analysis is underway to ascertain the integrity of Bitfinex’s systems. Furthermore, the platform’s KYC system, designed with stringent rate limits, theoretically prevents mass data exfiltration, suggesting that any large-scale data leak might be implausible.The incident has drawn the attention of various security experts and researchers, accelerating the spread of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) across the sector. It’s worth noting that many of the leaked account details correlate with data from previous breaches, like the one at Coinmarketcap, highlighting a common issue where users recycle credentials across multiple platforms.As investigations continue and the crypto community remains on high alert, the real challenge lies in discerning the true scale and impact of the breach. With funds reportedly secure, the primary concern now shifts to the potential misuse of personal data and the overarching vulnerabilities exposed by such incidents in the cryptocurrency exchanges.

MATIC Bullish Signals Abound: Technical Indicators Hint At Sustained Uptrend


                            MATIC is the native utility token of the Polygon blockchain and it is currently ranked 18th by market cap, with a total supply of 10 billion MATIC and a total trading volume of over $204 million in the last 24 hours. It has been moving upward since its last rejection at a $0.6342 support level.  
Following the recent bullish trend of the crypto market, MATIC has not been left behind as the price has been on an uptrend with very strong momentum for a while now. Since its last rejection point, MATIC has seen a price reversal of over 10%.
Technical Indicators Point Toward Sustained Uptrend For MATIC
To figure out where MATIC’s price might be headed next, several indicators can be used to examine the chart;
1-Day MACD: A technical look at the MACD indicator from the 4-hour timeframe, the MACD histograms are trending above the zero line, and both the MACD line and the Signal line have crossed and are heading towards the MACD zero line, indicating a bullish trend.

1-Day RSI: the formation of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the above image also suggests an upward movement as the RSI signal line is seen moving toward the 50% level. This indicates that buyers are gradually becoming active in the market therefore overpowering the strength of sellers.
4-hour Alligator: A look at the alligator indicator from the 4-hour time frame shows that the crypto asset is trading above the alligator lines as the alligator lip and teeth have both successfully crossed above the alligator jaw, suggesting that the price might continue to move in an upward direction.

Potential Price Movement
From the previous downward movement, the price of MATIC has managed to create one major resistance level of $0.7365 and one major support level of $0.6324. Currently, MATIC is moving toward this resistance level and if it breaks above this level, it might go even further to test the next resistance level of $0.7680. 
However, if it fails to break above this major resistance, it will reverse and start a downward movement toward its previous support. Also, if it manages to break below this support level, the price might move further downward thereby continuing on its downtrend. As of the time of writing the price of MATIC was trading around $0.7253 and about -0.94% down in the last 24 hour

Bitfinex CTO denies new allegations of user data hack, assures funds are secure - Crypto Briefing




Bitfinex has been thrust into the spotlight recently after a ransomware group, named “FSOCIETY,” claimed to have gained access to 2.5TB of the exchange’s data and the personal details of 400,000 users. In response to the allegations, Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino clarified that the claims of a database hack appear to be “fake” and assured user funds remain secure.Ardoino found out there were data discrepancies and user data mismatches in the hacker’s posts.The hackers posted sample data containing 22,500 records of emails and passwords. However, according to Paolo, Bitfinex does not store plain-text passwords or two-factor authentication (2FA) secrets in clear text. Additionally, of the 22,500 emails in the leaked data, only 5,000 match Bitfinex users.According to him, it could be a common issue in data security: users often reuse the same email and password across multiple sites, which might explain the presence of some Bitfinex-related emails in the dataset.Another highlight is the lack of communication from the hackers. They did not contact Bitfinex directly to report this data breach or to negotiate, which is atypical behavior for ransomware attacks that typically involve some form of ransom demand or contact.Moreover, information about the alleged hack was posted on April 25, but Bitfinex only became aware of the claim recently. Paolo said if there had been any genuine threat or demand, the hackers would have likely used Bitfinex’s bug bounty program or customer support channels to make contact, none of which occurred.
“The alleged hackers didn’t contact us. If they had any real information they would have asked a ramson through our bug bounty, customer support ticket etc. We couldn’t find any request,” wrote Ardoino.
Bitfinex has conducted a thorough analysis of its systems and, so far, has not found any evidence of a breach. Paolo said the team would continue to review and analyze all available data to ensure that nothing is overlooked in their security assessments.After news of a potential breach surfaced, Shinoji Research, an X user, confirmed the authenticity of the leak. The user said he tried one of the passwords in the leaked information and received a 2FA.However, at press time, he removed his post and corrected the previous information.In a separate post on X, Ardoino suggested that the real motive behind the exaggerated breach claims is to sell the hacking tool to other potential scammers.The idea is to generate buzz around these high-profile (Bitfinex, SBC Global, Rutgers, Coinmoma) hacks to promote their tool, which they allege can enable others to carry out similar attacks and potentially make large sums of money.Additionally, he questioned why the hackers would need to sell a hacking tool for $299 if they had really accessed Bitfinex and obtained valuable data.

How stablecoins are shaking up parallel financial networks | Cryptopolitan

Imagine a world where monetary authorities might need to rescue cryptocurrency markets. We almost saw this scenario unfold with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last year. SVB’s downfall shook the stablecoin operator Circle, which had a whopping $3.3 billion uninsured at SVB. This crisis saw Circle’s USDC—a token touted for its stability—lose its peg to the dollar until the Federal Reserve stepped in to secure the bank’s deposits, averting a larger crisis. As the crypto market rebounds from its low in 2022, stablecoins are capturing widespread attention. These tokens, created by private firms, mimic digital cash, typically matching the U.S. dollar one-for-one. Their reserves are expected to hold equivalent U.S. dollar amounts. The push for stablecoins is gaining momentum with new entries from corporations like PayPal and Ripple. Legislative support is also on the rise, with Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand proposing laws to provide a solid framework for these tokens.The reemergence of Stripe marked another turn. After a six-year hiatus from crypto payments, Stripe’s return underscores a renewed interest in integrating cryptocurrency into mainstream finance. Jonathan Bixby, a notable figure in the crypto world, remarked that Stripe’s strategy mirrors the earlier U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which aimed to integrate traditional capital into crypto. He suggested that Stripe’s initiative might be a reversal, bringing crypto into everyday financial transactions.The use of stablecoins goes beyond just technological innovation; they are beginning to answer the critical question of crypto’s practical applications. These tokens are not just theoretical but are actively used in real-world transactions. Visa’s analysis revealed over $2.5 trillion in stablecoin transactions within just 30 days, with USDC outpacing its rival Tether. However, removing automated trading transactions drops the volume dramatically, suggesting a heavy reliance on programmed trading in decentralized finance platforms.This growing use of stablecoins positions them as potential major players in the shadow banking system, which includes various non-bank financial institutions like asset managers and insurance companies. If stablecoins can command large-scale transactions, they could become custodians of vast sums of money.Currently, most stablecoin holders invest in short-term U.S. Treasuries or keep funds in bank deposits, benefiting from returns or safekeeping. Some engage in reverse repo markets, lending out cash for short periods against secure collateral like Treasuries. This strategy safeguards against counterparty risks, essential in maintaining financial stability.However, Frances Coppola, a financial commentator, points out the drawbacks of these strategies. If stablecoin operators focus solely on short-term asset holding, they might struggle to generate significant profits. Moreover, the mismatch between the durations of their assets and liabilities could pose additional financial risks.There’s a broader fear among federal regulators that stablecoins might accumulate too many Treasuries, prompting discussions about potentially limiting their growth. Although concerns about their size and impact may seem distant, underestimating these factors could lead to significant issues as the market scale increases.The reintroduction of crypto payments, coupled with Stripe’s expanded service offerings allowing integration with competing payment solutions, shows a strategic pivot towards more open and versatile financial operations.John Collison, co-founder of Stripe, humorously noted that transaction settlements and costs with stablecoins are now far more manageable, unlike the epic scale of Christopher Nolan’s films. This comparison not only lightens the mood but also emphasizes the efficiency and user-friendliness of using stablecoins over traditional cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrency investor loses $70 million in six hours: Address poisoning attack


A cryptocurrency investor has fallen victim to an address poisoning attack, resulting in a staggering loss of $70 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). The incident, which unfolded over the course of around six hours, has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community.
According to a post by Lookonchain on the X, the unfortunate investor created a new address, “0xd9A1b0B1e1aE382DbDc898Ea68012FfcB2853a91,” and transferred a small amount of Ethereum (ETH), approximately 0.05 ETH, to this newly generated destination.

This observed behavior is common in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, mainly due to the need for gas fees. Essentially, when cryptocurrency investors create new crypto wallet addresses, they need to fund them with the native token first to pay for future gas fees, in this case, Ether or ETH.


However, a scammer had been waiting unbeknownst to the investor, ready to strike at the opportune moment.
Address poisoning attack
The scammer, employing a technique known as address poisoning, generated an address that shared the same starting and ending letters as the investor’s new address. In a calculated move, the scammer transferred zero ETH to the investor, causing it to appear in the investor’s transaction history.
Many cryptocurrency wallets hide the middle portion of addresses with ellipses (“…”) to enhance user interface aesthetics. Therefore, when the investor attempted to transfer their 1,155 WBTC, valued at approximately $71 million, they inadvertently copied the scammer’s cleverly crafted address, believing it to be their own.
Notably, crypto users often only check the destination address by quickly glancing at the first and last four characters.
The devastating consequence of this mistake was the irreversible transfer of the investor’s WBTC holdings to the scammer’s address. The crypto community has expressed shock and disbelief at the magnitude of the loss, with many calling for increased awareness and education surrounding the risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions.

This incident underscores the critical importance of thoroughly verifying addresses before initiating any transfers, particularly when dealing with substantial sums of digital assets. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, it is imperative that investors remain vigilant and stay abreast of the latest security measures and best practices to safeguard their investments.

Weekend Market Watch - Altcoins soar as Bitcoin recovers above $64K

Following a week of declining trends, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin experienced a surge in trading on Saturday afternoon. Following the April 2024 jobs data release by the U.S. Labor Department, there was a significant surge in crypto values. Last month, the U.S. saw an increase of 175,000 jobs, resulting in a slight rise in the unemployment rate to 3.9%. Experts had predicted the addition of 235,000 new jobs and a 3.8% unemployment rate.Altcoins season dominates yet againBitcoin experienced a tumultuous trading week with significant price drops on multiple occasions. The week began with a promising surge as BTC reached nearly $65,000, but unfortunately, the market quickly fell under the control of the bears, causing it to drop to $62,000.The downward trend continued as the asset plummeted to and below $60,000. The correction reached a two-month low of $56,500 on Wednesday, just before the latest US FOMC meeting.After the necessary steps were taken and the Federal Reserve announced its decision to hold off on raising interest rates in the near future, BTC experienced a sudden surge of $2,000 followed by a rapid decline, ultimately returning to its initial position. It made significant progress in the subsequent hours and came close to reaching $60,000 yesterday, as reported.Initially halted, it eventually managed to overcome that mental barrier later in the day. The market bulls maintained their momentum and drove BTC to reach a multi-day high of $63,500. Despite experiencing a slight decline, the current value of Bitcoin is approximately $63,000.With a daily increase of 6%, the market cap of this asset has now reached $1.240 trillion, solidifying its dominance over altcoins at 50.5%.The top performers among the largest altcoins are found in the unpredictable meme coin sector. Dogecoin, the first and largest of the cohort, has experienced a significant increase of over 20%. Following the recent announcement, Tesla has decided to accept DOGE as a form of payment.PEPE has experienced a significant increase of 11.7%, while SHIB has also seen a gain of 8% and is now valued above $0.000025. Ethereum and Binance Coin have both experienced a notable increase of approximately 3.5%. As a result, the price of ETH has surged to over $3,127, while BNB is currently trading at $590.The remaining larger-cap altcoins are also showing gains, such as TON, BC, AVAX, NEAR, and HBAR. The crypto market cap has seen a remarkable recovery, surging by over $200 billion since Wednesday’s low. Currently, it stands at an impressive $2.4 trillion, according to CoinGecko.Bitcoin market performanceBitcoin’s price has experienced significant fluctuations over the past few weeks. The bulls are making a strong comeback, successfully reclaiming their dominance by surpassing the $60K mark. But can it be sustained in the long run? The price of BTC has experienced a significant rebound of over 12.50% within a span of three days, following a recent dip to a two-month low of around $56,550. It has now surged past $64,000 as of May 4.The recent upturn has been primarily driven by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep interest rates steady until 2024. In addition, the latest U.S. employment data shows a decrease in jobless claims to their lowest point since mid-February, which has contributed to the continued upward trend in Bitcoin’s price.Some members of the Bitcoin market are hopeful for a sustained BTC bull run in the upcoming months. One independent market analyst predicts that the price of BTC could potentially reach $85,000. The crypto market has experienced significant growth in 2024, despite the presence of higher interest rates and indications of a weakening economy. In addition, the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. provided a significant boost.However, it is important to note that certain factors that have been driving the market may be losing momentum, which could have a negative impact on valuations in the future. Unless there is a substantial improvement in the practicality of cryptocurrencies, this could pose a long-term challenge.Currently, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) stands at $63,636.10, reflecting a slight 0.1% increase within the past hour and a notable 3.3% increase since yesterday. The current value of BTC is 1.4% higher than it was 7 days ago.

Ethereum and XRP Statements from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse - Bitcoin Sistemi


Fox Business' cryptocurrency journalist Eleanor Terrett explained in her statement the details of the speech given by Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, the company behind XRP, at the conference called “the future of digital assets”.
According to Terrett, Ripple CEO said in his statement that Ethereum is not a security, and in addition, XRP is not a security either. Garlinghouse stated that the SEC was “very wrong” and called SEC chairman Gary Gensler “an unethical person.”


The SEC maintains that all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are securities and must be registered with the SEC. However, the institution, which previously had a more moderate attitude towards Ethereum, has recently been working on the fact that ETH is also a security.

However, in his tweet, Garlinghouse expressed his excitement at the increase in the amount of events held by the XRP community this year, including XRP Las Vegas and XRPL apex, as well as the XRP Gold Coast event in March.





Garlinghouse also expressed his welcome for new native capabilities for projects built on the XRP Ledger.

EXCLUSIVE: Trump-Themed MAGA Memecoin Plans To Rival Dogecoin And Shiba Inu With 'Four More Years Of Catalysts' - Benzinga

“I can't think of anyone else who is a greater source of meta than Donald Trump.”Steven Steele, chief marketing officer of MAGA Memecoin TRUMP/USD, the Trump-themed cryptocurrency that has been making waves for being the former president’s biggest portfolio holding, thinks it is “increasingly likely” the 45th president becomes the 47th president of the United States.In that case, we could be provided with “four more years of hilarity and catalysts,” Steele told Benzinga in an interview. Polls have the former and the current presidents neck-and-neck, as have prediction markets, which gave Trump a two-point edge over Joe Biden, as of May 4. Whether he secures a successful re-election bid or not, interest in Donald Trump will likely intensify between now and Nov. 5.And with it, the appeal of investing in TRUMP, Steele said. He told Benzinga he cannot think of any person that will be covered more than Trump going into the election season “and probably beyond.”How MAGA Memecoin Turned ‘The Most Covered Person’ Into A CryptocurrencyAndrew Kang, a crypto venture capitalist, sees Trump as “one of the best attention monopolizers in the world.”His fund Mechanism Capital announced on Feb. 6 that it had accumulated TRUMP — the first meme coin than can “rival Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD.”Indeed, among meme coins, MAGA Memecoin is somewhat of a pioneer. It was the first to successfully introduce a meme coin based on a real-world person or cultural phenomenon. Speculating on the attention created by certain events, such as the death of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, has since become a staple of the meme coin circus.Steele, who initially was just an investor in TRUMP, said the “enormous potential” made him join as chief marketing officer. Following its inception in August 2023, TRUMP grew to a preliminary peak of $448 million in market capitalization on March 5 and is currently trading around a valuation of $220 million.Steele attributes this rise in value to several key points:Consistent marketing: MAGA Memecoin holds weekly spaces for its community and publishes Trump-themed memes on its X account.Philanthropic action: The project has donated over $1 million in Ethereum ETH/USD for 37 straight weeks to support for homeless veterans and the prevention of child trafficking. Steele pointed out this was one of key points that drew him in, with the National Veterans Homeless Support being able to scale its operation thanks to the donations.Partnerships: MAGA Memecoin recently announced it had onboarded controversial political figure and self-proclaimed “agent provocateur” Roger Stone as a partner. But the inevitable consequence of success is competition, a rule that applies even — or particularly — to meme coins.Read Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Rally, As Market Sentiment Soars On Macro Data: ‘Above $67,000 We Fly Like A Bird,’ Claims Trader‘To Get Unprecedented Results, You Have To Do Unprecedented Things’In a March interview with Coindesk, Steele said he wants TRUMP “up there with a DOGE or SHIB, that kind of scale and market cap and popularity.” Asked how to make that a reality, Steele told Benzinga, “To get unprecedented results, you have to do unprecedented things.” Signing Stone is one example of that, Steele pointed out, as it brought MAGA Memecoin a lot of “normie” investors that bought TRUMP as their first cryptocurrency. But since Steele’s March interview, the political meme coin landscape has changed. TRUMP isn’t the only politicial meme coin anymore. In fact, it currently isn’t even the biggest one. BODEN BODEN/USD a meme coin parodying Biden with intentionally poor spelling and cartoons, has recorded an astronomic surge to over $700 million in market capitalization and is currently trading at a valuation of around $290 million. The emergence of a quasi-rival has even sparked a prediction market about which meme coin would get to $1 billion first (BODEN is leading TRUMP 54% to 46%).Steele told Benzinga he is aware of the coin — and others that have boarded the “PoliFi” meta — but isn’t worried by or interested in them.Indeed, a de facto rivalry between the two meme coins, similar to that between Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, could be positive and create more interest and loyalty among holders.But what does the man whose face is on the memes powering MAGA Memecoin think of all of this?Read Also: Dogecoin Is ‘Primed For Higher’ But Pepe Is ‘On A Moon Mission,’ Exclaims Trader‘More Than Enough Reasons To Believe’ Trump Knows Of TRUMPDonald Trump’s stance on Bitcoin BTC/USD and crypto has shifted from considering them a “disaster waiting to happen” and being “not a big fan” in 2021 to now expressing enjoyment with crypto and the “crazy new currencies” apart from Bitcoin.Steele thinks there are “more than enough reasons to believe” the former president is aware of the meme coin his personality started, especially considering Stone was a consultant for Trump’s 2016 campaign. He suggested that Trump may have been referring to MAGA Memecoin in his mention of “crazy new currencies.”Steele also shared that Trump is aware and a fan of Shawn Farash, the host of the project’s weekly spaces and a proficient Trump impersonator.Trump’s allocation of TRUMP was an intentional “strategically savvy and hilarious” move by the project to promote the coin. And, just as planned, it has since become Trump’s biggest holding.But what if Trump sells “his bag” of MAGA Memecoin? If the meme coin were to appreciate going into the election season, Trump’s current holdings of $2.73 million may prompt him to think about cashing out.Steele acknowledged the possibility but does not see it as a problem. Similar to the 2021 incident when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sold and donated his allocation of SHIB, Steele thinks it may even have a positive impact on MAGA Memecoin.Whether TRUMP can really become, as Andrew Kang said, the first meme coin to break the reign of dog-themed incumbents remains to be seen. Meme coins like Pepe PEPE/USD and dogwifhat WIF/USD — yet another dog coin — hold a substantial lead over political meme coins. But when considering the combination of the “memecoin supercycle” with the “weirdest campaign” the incumbent president has ever been in, who knows what may happen between now and November?Read Next: Trump Says London, Paris No Longer Recognizable: ‘We Can’t Let That Happen Here’Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney

Paolo Ardoino Says There Is No Evidence of Bitfinex Hack


Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino has confidently dismissed claims of a security breach at the cryptocurrency exchange. 
Ardoino’s clarification comes after rumors circulated about a potential database leak involving 22,500 records of emails and passwords purportedly from Bitfinex users.
Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino Denies Hack Rumors
According to Ardoino, the evidence presented by the alleged hackers does not align with Bitfinex’s data handling practices. He highlighted a significant discrepancy in the data. Consequently, noting that only about 5,000 of the 22,500 emails matched Bitfinex user accounts. 
This is a clear indicator, he suggests, that if these records were from Bitfinex, there would be a complete match.

“We don’t store plaintext passwords, nor 2FA secrets in clear text. [And] only 5,000 of 22,500 emails are matching with Bitfinex users. If that was part of our database, we would expect 100% matching,” Ardoino said. 

The timing and method of the hackers’ claim also raise questions about its legitimacy. Ardoino pointed out that the hackers did not contact Bitfinex directly. Their claim was made public on April 25, with a seven-day response window, which Bitfinex only discovered a day before the deadline. 


“If they had any real information, they would have asked for a ransom through our bug bounty program, customer support ticket, emails, or Twitter,” Ardoino explained.

Security experts quickly jumped on the bandwagon, hyping the breach without substantial evidence. For instance, Shinoji Research claimed that 2.5 terabytes of customer data was leaked. However, Bitfinex’s preliminary investigations suggest that the database is likely a compilation of information from various cryptocurrency breaches.
Ardoino noted that it is common for users to reuse email and password combinations across multiple sites, which might explain the overlap.

As Bitfinex continues its thorough review and system analysis, Ardoino reassured users and stakeholders, stating, “While we believe this is pure FUD, we’ll keep reviewing information to ensure no stone remains unturned.”

Fed's Williams insists that 2% inflation target 'critical'

According to New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams, maintaining price stability and achieving economic prosperity heavily relies on the U.S. central bank’s 2% inflation target.In the coming months, policymakers at the Fed are set to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the central bank’s policy framework, with several critics advocating for significant modifications.Fed set to go hard on rate cutsIn the face of ongoing demands for the Reserve to revamp its approach to guiding, setting, and communicating policy, he staunchly defends the importance of the inflation target.Theory and experience have also shown the importance of transparency and clear communication, including setting an explicit, numerical longer-run inflation target, and of taking appropriate actions to support the achievement of that goal […] These are critical in anchoring inflation expectations, which, in turn, help keep inflation at the target.
New York’s reserve President John WilliamsFor over two years, the Fed has been actively addressing the issue of high inflation. In March 2022, they made the decision to raise interest rates by over 5%  points, which is a remarkably bold move not witnessed in four decades.Although price pressures have eased since their peak in mid-2022, inflation continues to exceed the Fed’s 2% goal, which has been a key focus of the Fed’s policy since 2012. In fact, Lawrence Summers, the former U.S. Treasury Secretary, suggested at the same conference that the Fed should reconsider its 2% inflation goal.According to his prediction, retaining it would lead to a significant economic downturn in the United States in the near future. Summers also criticized other aspects of the Commission’s communication, particularly the variety of policy views expressed by central bankers in speeches and public events.Rate cuts effects on the crypto marketSpeaking on the same panel as Williams, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee emphasized the importance of diverse perspectives and highlighted the significance of effective communication.It would be beneficial for the Fed to enhance its quarterly “dot plot” of policymakers’ interest-rate-path views by incorporating the individual economic expectations that shape each projection.In a recent decision, the entityls policymakers opted to maintain short-term borrowing costs within the 5.25%-5.5% range, which has remained unchanged since July 2023. Goolsbee and Williams did not provide any recent insights into the direction of inflation this year or the timing of potential rate cuts by the Fed.Traders have been shaken by the recent decline in digital asset prices, which has been further intensified by ongoing macroeconomic challenges. How negative are the sentiments in the crypto market today?Fed and the crypto weekendIndicators of optimism, or the lack thereof, can be observed in betting markets such as Polymarket and Fed fund futures, which are actively traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. These vague yet combined predictions regarding the timing of potential interest rate cuts by the Fed Reserve highlight a noticeable difference.Traders on Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform, observed a 7% probability in March that the Commission would maintain interest rates unchanged until 2024. Currently, traders are estimating a 38% probability that the entity will not implement any rate cuts throughout the year.That’s significantly more negative than the 23% probability of no rate cuts calculated on Tuesday by investment analysis firm Bianco Research. The organization utilized data from the CME’s FedWatch Tool, which indicates that CME traders are predicting a 45% probability of a rate cut by the Fed in September.When interest rates rise, the appeal of riskier assets such as stocks and crypto tends to diminish. Investors find the returns on these assets less enticing compared to more stable options like cash and U.S. Treasury bills.Following its policy meeting in March, the Fed Reserve projected three rate cuts of a quarter-percentage point each for the remainder of the year. In light of recent indications of persistent inflation in the United States and unexpectedly robust wage growth, Fed Reserve policymakers and participants in the financial markets have become less confident.

Another Cryptocurrency Platform Developer Disappears with Investors' Money - Bitcoin Sistemi


LENX Finance, which had raised $10.22 million through LBP financing on January 7 this year, is now under suspicion of a rug pull scam. Many users reported that all treasury funds were transferred on March 27, and the official Twitter account also stopped updating since then.
Originally known as RenaissanceDAO, a fragmented NFT marketplace inspired by OlympusDAO, the LENX team closed a $250,000 seed round investment in Frax Finance on February 28, 2022.



In another development, the cryptocurrency space faced another rug pull claim about two weeks ago. This time, blockchain platform ZKasino was at the center of the accusations, with many investors claiming their money was stolen. Despite the allegations, ZKasino continued to post updates before disappearing from the public eye along with investors' money.
The latest development shows that a suspect was arrested by authorities in the Netherlands and over $12 million was seized in the process. A 26-year-old man was arrested earlier this week over a ZKasino rug pull, the Dutch Financial Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) announced on Wednesday.





According to the press release, Dutch authorities began investigating the $33 million crypto platform scam on April 25. The criminal investigation began with online reports from the crypto community and information from FIOD's intelligence departments.

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) Coin Will Surge 7,000% Within 48 Hours, as it Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) Wallet Loses $69,300,000 Worth of Crypto in Apparent Address Poisoning Scam - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto wallet lost $69.3 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) in an apparent address-poisoning attack, according to the blockchain security firm CertiK.
Address poisoning usually involves a scammer sending a wallet a tiny amount of crypto via an address that’s designed to look similar to the wallet’s, according to an explanation provided by Ledger, a digital asset wallet provider.










The ploy is designed to trick wallet holders into mistakenly copying the scammer’s address from their transaction history and having funds sent to that wallet instead.
In this instance, CertiK notes that a scammer mimicked a transfer of 0.05 Ethereum (ETH), which tricked the victim into sending 1,155 WBTC worth $69.3 million to the wrong address.
WBTC is an ERC-20 token pegged to the price of BTC, allowing traders to speculate on Bitcoin while staying within the Ethereum ecosystem. The 16th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $62,953 at time of writing and is up nearly 7% in the past 24 hours.
The blockchain security firm Peckshield notes that the scammer swapped out the stolen WBTC for 23,000 ETH and then transferred them out.
Ethereum is trading at $3,116 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 4% in the past 24 hours.

Dogecoin Price Slides Amidst Crypto Market Correction: Down 4.82% to $0.15



                    

Dogecoin‘s value has taken a hit amidst a broader decline in the cryptocurrency market. On April 27, DOGE saw a decrease of 4.82%, settling at approximately $0.15.



This decline was more pronounced compared to the overall crypto market, which experienced a 2.25% drop on the same day. 




Over the past month, Dogecoin has plummeted by 38% from its recent peak of $0.229.



The recent downturn in Dogecoin’s price can be attributed to several factors, with one significant influence being the release of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) report on April 25. 



The U.S. economy’s growth in the first quarter of 2024 fell short of expectations, recording a 1.6% increase instead of the anticipated 2.5%. 




Additionally, there was only a 0.3% rise in personal consumption expenditures for March.



Consequently, expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2024 have been revised down to just 33 basis points, a considerable reduction from earlier projections.



The anticipation of sustained high interest rates has led to a rise in the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note, reaching 4.739% on April 24, its highest level in five months. 



This increase has made riskier crypto assets less appealing to investors. For instance, on the day when the yield peaked, five spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced outflows totaling $217 million.

Furthermore, Dogecoin’s open interest (OI) has declined to $865.63 million on April 27 from its peak of $2.21 billion nearly a month ago. 



Additionally, the funding rate has dropped to 0.0063% per eight hours. 



These developments indicate a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market, with traders adopting a cautious stance due to uncertainty surrounding Dogecoin’s future price movements or reduced interest in high leverage trading.



Today’s decrease in Dogecoin’s price appears to be a continuation of a selling trend that started when the price encountered resistance marked by a descending trendline and the 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA). 



The descending trendline resistance has consistently hindered DOGE’s upward movements over the past 30 days. 



Currently, the cryptocurrency is testing its multi-week ascending trendline support, suggesting a potential rebound that could propel the price towards the descending trendline resistance at around $0.159 by the end of April.

Ukraine Unveils a 'Technological Leap That No Diplomatic Service in the World Has Yet Made'" | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to a report by The Guardian, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry recently a groundbreaking announcement on Wednesday, introducing an AI-generated spokesperson named Victoria Shi, a pioneering move in the world of international diplomacy. Dressed in a dark suit and presented in a video on social media, Victoria is designed to deliver official statements that are written and verified by human staff but presented through her digital persona.



The Foreign Ministry highlighted that this innovative approach is intended to optimize resource utilization and save time for its diplomats. Victoria’s introduction represents a significant shift towards integrating advanced technology in government operations, underscoring a commitment to modernization and efficiency.



According to the report, Victoria Shi, termed a “digital person” by the ministry, embodies a blend of technology and human effort. She gesticulates and moves naturally, adding a layer of human-like interaction that is often missing in digital communications. The statements she delivers are crafted by human experts, ensuring that the content remains accurate and trustworthy while the AI handles the visual representation.



Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the initiative as a “technological leap that no diplomatic service in the world has yet made,” pointing to the innovative use of AI in public administration. 







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The name “Victoria Shi” draws from the word “victory” and the Ukrainian phrase for artificial intelligence, “shtuchniy intelekt.” Her creators, a team known as the Game Changers who are also involved in virtual-reality content related to the war in Ukraine, designed her to embody a forward-looking, victorious image that resonates with the Ukrainian spirit.



Interestingly, the report went on to say that Victoria’s appearance and voice are modeled after Rosalie Nombre, a well-known Ukrainian singer and a former contestant on Ukraine’s version of “The Bachelor.” Nombre, born in the now Russian-controlled city of Donetsk, lent her likeness to the project without charge, contributing to a cause that blends national pride with technological innovation.



To maintain authenticity and prevent misinformation, all statements made by Victoria will be accompanied by a QR code linking back to the text versions on the ministry’s official website.

Economist Nouriel Roubini blasts Bitcoin’s decentralization as ‘nonsense'


Renowned economist Nouriel Roubini has once again delivered a scathing critique of Bitcoin (BTC), questioning its decentralization and doubts about security and scalability. 
Notably, Roubini has maintained a dismissive stance towards Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency space, often branding them as scams.
In a May 3 debate organized by financial news aggregator Zerohedge, where Bitcoin was pitted against gold, Roubini dismantled the foundational principles of the leading cryptocurrency. 


Drawing on his reputation for accurately predicting the 2008 financial crisis, he argued that Bitcoin’s security and scalability promises are less fulfilled than those of traditional monetary systems.
Roubini underscored the vulnerability of Bitcoin holders, stressing the irreversible nature of transactions once private keys are compromised. Unlike traditional banking systems that offer recourse options in case of theft, he pointed out that the loss of private keys results in permanent loss of funds, painting a bleak picture of Bitcoin’s security landscape.
Questioning Bitcoin’s decentralization 
Furthermore, Roubini challenged the concept of Bitcoin’s decentralization, dismissing it as “nonsense.” He highlighted the concentration of mining power among a few significant players, which, in his view, undermines any claim to decentralization. 

“In the traditional financial system, there’s massive scalability. Yes, we have a centralized system. Bitcoin, first of all, is not secure. <…> It’s not even decentralized. <…> This idea of decentralized is nonsense. It’s neither decentralized, secure, nor scalable. It’s three NOs,” he said. 

Roubini raised concerns about the dominance of mining operations, particularly in regions with tax regulatory oversight, which threatens the network’s integrity.
Alternative to traditional finance
In addition, he rejected Bitcoin as a viable alternative to traditional financial systems, citing its purported inefficiency in handling large transaction volumes. 
The financial expert also likened storing Bitcoin to burying gold in the ground, describing it as a cumbersome and impractical solution in the digital age.
His sentiment comes amid his continued bashing of cryptocurrencies. The economist has termed crypto “totally corrupt” and the “biggest criminal heist in human history.” 
The expert has also warned of a possible “crypto apocalypse” for the industry, mainly due to regulators cracking down on the sector.

Shiba Inu coin - Here's the roadmap for a 100% hike in SHIB's price - AMBCrypto



After a period of correction, SHIB surged by 8% in just 24 hours 
Most metrics supported the possibility of a 100% price hike 

Shiba Inu’s [SHIB] bulls took control of the market as the token’s price surged dramatically over the last few hours. This might be the tip of the iceberg, however, as if the latest data is considered, SHIB might be preparing for a whopping 100% price hike in the coming weeks. 
Shiba Inu bulls buckle up
After a month of sustained price corrections, the memecoin’s price chart finally saw some green on the back of Bitcoin’s recovery. According to CoinMarketCap, SHIB’s price appreciated by over 8% in 24 hours, injecting much optimism into the market. 
The hike in price also had a major impact on SHIB’s social metrics, as its social volume rose last week. Additionally, its weighted sentiment surged on the charts. Simply put, bullish sentiment seemed to have regained its market dominance as SHIB’s value climbed. 
Source: Santiment
This outcome seems likely as the memecoin’s price was moving inside a bullish flag pattern, at press time. World of Charts, a popular crypto-analyst, recently shared a tweet about this pattern. As per the same, if SHIB manages to break above the pattern, it could result in a 100%–120% rally in the following weeks. 
Shiba Inu has more to offer
The possibility of a 100% bull rally translating into reality increased when AMBCrypto checked Glassnode’s data. We found that the memecoin’s Network to Value (NVT) ratio dipped over the last few days. 
A drop in the metric means that an asset is undervalued, hinting at a price hike in the near term. 
Source: Glassnode
Apart from this, investors’ confidence in SHIB remained high as buying pressure on the altcoin increased. Shiba Inu’s supply on exchanges dropped slightly while its supply outside of exchange went up, indicating buying pressure on the meme coin was high. 
Our look at CryptoQuant’s data also revealed that investors have been buying SHIB as its exchange reserves dropped. 
Source: Santiment
A few indicators seemed to support the idea of a rally sustaining itself.
 For instance, the MACD projected the possibility of a bullish crossover. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick and at press time, had a value of 49.7. 
AMBCrypto then checked Hyblock Capital’s data to find the immediate targets SHIB might hit on the road if it initiates a 100% rally. As per our analysis, it will be crucial for SHIB to go above $0.000025 in order to sustain the same. 

Read Shiba Inu [SHIB] Price Prediction 2024-25  

If it manages to achieve that, then the next possible target could be $0.000027, as liquidation would rise sharply at that level. A successful breakout above that level could allow SHIB to hit $0.00003 soon.

SEC charges Trump Media auditor with ‘massive fraud’

An auditor associated with former president Donald Trump’s Trump Media is facing serious allegations of engaging in fraudulent activities and operating an illegitimate audit operation, as stated by the US’s leading financial regulator (SEC) on Friday.BF Borgers and its owner, Benjamin Borgers, who serves clients such as Trump Media, have been charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with a fraudulent scheme that impacted over 1,500 SEC filings. Borgers has also represented financial technology and cryptocurrency companies, as indicated by SEC filings.Trump’s media head under SEC’s reviewAs stated in the company’s most recent annual report filing, BF Borgers was named as the auditor for Trump Media on March 28. The company revealed during that period that BF Borgers had also conducted its audits prior to the company’s public debut through a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp, a shell company with substantial funds.BF Borgers has agreed to pay a $12m civil penalty, while Benjamin Borgers has agreed to pay a $2m civil penalty, in order to settle the SEC’s civil charges. They have also agreed to permanent suspensions from practicing as accountants on SEC filings, effective immediately.It was unclear right away which filings or companies had been impacted.The company had previously gone through at least two other auditors — one that resigned the account in July 2023 and another that was terminated by the board in March, just as it was re-hiring BF Borgers.In a statement, Trump Media expressed its anticipation of collaborating with new auditing partners in compliance with the recent SEC order.As per the SEC, Borgers failed to adequately prepare and maintain audit documentation, falsely claimed to have conducted audit planning meetings, and at times used previous audits as if they were for the current audit period.According to Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, Ben Borgers and his audit firm, BF Borgers, were involved in a significant failure by gatekeepers in our financial markets.As a result of their fraudulent conduct, they not only put investors and markets at risk by causing public companies to incorporate non-compliant audits and reviews into more than 1,500 filings with the commission but also undermined trust and confidence in our markets.
The SECSEC’s stand on BF BorgersOut of 369 clients served by BF Borgers, a significant majority of their filings from January 2021 through June 2023 included audits that did not meet the SEC’s regulations.BF Borgers’ shortcuts involved the unethical practice of duplicating audit documentation from a previous year, altering important dates, and presenting it as current documentation. Furthermore, the fabricated documentation not only included records of work that was never performed, but also falsely claimed that planning meetings with clients took place and misrepresented that both Benjamin Borgers and another reviewer had endorsed the audit work.During the period of the SEC’s complaint, BF Borgers represented Trump Media. In late March, Trump Media merged with a publicly traded shell company, Digital World Acquisition Corp, in a deal that valued the social network at close to $8bn. The company now trades under the ticker symbol “DJT,” using the initials of its founder.Shares of Trump Media have experienced a significant decline since their initial launch. However, despite doubts about the value of the social media platform and the company’s financial challenges, the stock has continued to greatly enhance the wealth of the former president.The share price of Trump Media experienced a decline of over 5% on Friday but ultimately closed the day with a decrease of 1.54%. However, it has shown an overall increase of nearly 14% over the past five trading days. The company’s current valuation exceeds $6.5 billion. As the company’s largest shareholder, Trump recently qualified for a bonus based on the company’s share performance. This boosted the paper value of his stake to $3.7bn.

More than half of the Fortune 100 uses Apple’s Vision Pro headset

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, a mixed-reality spatial computing device, has been adopted by a majority of Fortune 100 companies with more than half purchasing at least one. Company CEO Tim Cook relayed the information during Apple’s first quarter 2024 earnings call, citing Vision Pro adoption as a sign of increased enthusiasm for the company’s products:“For example, more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought Apple Vision Pro units and are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren't possible before.”The Vision Pro launched in early February of 2024 with a price tag of $3,499 in the United States. In the time since, it doesn’t appear to have made much of a dent in the consumer market where much lower priced options such as Meta’s Quest line of VR headsets. As Cointelegraph recently reported, however, the Vision Pro headset and Apple’s lead in the spatial computing arena have it poised to bring the metaverse mainstream and become the default choice for enterprise adoption. Where the most popular headsets tend to offer virtual reality experiences featuring total immersion in a digital space, the Vision Pro is designed for mixed and augmented reality experiences combining the real world and digital imagery. Apple refers to this as spatial computing. VIDEOInstead of featuring the device as a gaming and social product, the companies adopting the Vision Pro appear to be using it for metaverse-related enterprise functions. One such example involves using the headset to help train doctors to perform surgeries when cadavers aren’t readily available. Cook also teased an upcoming update during the earnings call, stating that the Fortune 100 adoption is “just the beginning.” He then added that “Looking ahead, we're getting ready for an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love.” It’s unclear if this will be related to Vision Pro — rumors have the Vision Pro 2 launching in 2026 with a less expensive model arriving in the interim. If true, the timing of Apple’s next event, dubbed “Let Loose,” on May 7, could be perfect for the company to announce a cheaper Vision Pro for 2025.

Dogecoin’s Astronomical Flight To $1 Price Looks Nigh As Tesla Officially Adds DOGE Payment Option ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Elon Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin (DOGE), has formally been included on Tesla’s website as one of the EV maker’s official modes of payment.



The price of DOGE has soared double digits over the past day to cross $0.16 as the wider crypto market experiences a sharp recovery. The meme coin’s upswing today has led to enthusiasts questioning whether this marks the beginning of a full-fledged bull rally.



DOGE Appears Among Payment Methods On the Tesla Website



Tesla’s payments page has been updated to officially include the original meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE).



Notably, Elon Musk’s electric vehicle manufacturer only accepts DOGE for certain merchandise in the online Tesla Store. The addition notes that “Dogecoin may also be accepted on select products.” To purchase an item, buyers simply need to send DOGE to Tesla’s Dogecoin wallet address and make the payment.



On the website, Tesla clarifies that it supports only Dogecoin payments, and any other “non-Dogecoin digital assets sent to Tesla will not be returned to the purchaser.”

&nbsp



Dogecoin, with a market value of $23 billion, was created in 2013 as a mere joke, but the doggy-themed meme token has a semi-serious place in Musk’s heart. Tesla started accepting DOGE payments for its company merchandise in early 2022. Later that year, Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX also began accepting DOGE for merch. In March this year, he hinted that Tesla cars could be purchased using DOGE “at some point” in the future.



Though the eccentric billionaire no longer posts about Dogecoin as much, his cheerleading on X (formerly known as Twitter) spurred Dogecoin’s meteoric climb in 2021. DOGE hit its current all-time high of $0.73 on May 8, 2021, ahead of Musk’s appearance on SNL.



$1 Dogecoin Price In View



DOGE price has climbed over 15.9% over the last 24 hours to trade for $0.1623 at publication time on the major Tesla news.



Meanwhile, Musk’s “everything app” X is anticipated to integrate cryptocurrencies like DOGE in its upcoming payment feature, given his apparent infatuation with the canine-themed crypto.



Looking ahead, Dogecoin supporters remain optimistic about the meme cryptocurrency’s future price prospects. If it continues its recovery momentum, there is hope that DOGE could soon break past the $0.20 psychological resistance, paving the way for a potential rally to the coveted $1 mark and higher.

$83,000 Drained From Wells Fargo Accounts in Minutes - Customers Say Bank 'Rolling Their Eyes,' Blaming Them, Refusing To Reimburse - The Daily Hodl


								Two Wells Fargo customers are calling out the banking giant after scammers ripped tens of thousands of dollars from their accounts in a matter of minutes.
Jolinda Crocker says $60,000 was ripped from her account while she was teaching at her music school in Italy, reports the Daily Mail.










Crocker says she received a text message from the bank asking her to call and verify whether she had made two transactions, one for $24,973 and another for about $10,000.
She promptly called the bank, filed an online fraud report and thought everything was fine.
But a week and a half later, the bank began to blame Crocker stating she has initiated $60,000 in transactions herself, when her login history shows a login from Italy and another from California on the same day.
Crocker has now spent two years battling the bank to get her money back.
“It feels like everybody is just rolling their eyes. $60,000 is nothing to Wells Fargo but it’s my life savings.”
The story is similar to that of Judy Barr, who lost $23,865 to criminals pretending to be with Wells Fargo’s fraud department.
The scammers, who somehow had Barr’s social security number and personal banking details, sent an authorization code to Barr’s phone and asked her to repeat the numbers.
Now, the bank says Barr essentially initiated the transactions herself and refuses to reimburse.
“I was so embarrassed I didn’t even want to meet my friends for dinner. I felt like such an idiot. I was a Wells Fargo customer for over 20 years yet they have refused to take any responsibility. They put me through endless loops trying to get my money back.”
Wells Fargo is one of several large US banks facing lawsuits from customers who claim the financial giants have lax security measures, don’t properly verify large transactions and shrug their shoulders as fraudulent transactions are reported in real time.

Cardano (ADA) Historical Trends Suggest Parabolic Bull Run, Says Analyst | Cryptoglobe


                                
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently published an interesting thread on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) about Cardano (ADA), in which he analyzed historical price trends and compared them with the current market situation. According to him, the 50% price drop in ADA over the past month could be a great buying opportunity, as Cardano seems to be preparing for a parabolic bull run. Let’s take a closer look at his analysis.



In 2019, Martinez says Cardano consolidated within a parallel channel, signaling the end of the bear market. He went on to say that following this stagnation, the ADA price broke out of the channel with a 75% surge, followed by a 56% price correction, which set the stage for an impressive 4,095% bull run.



He also mentions that a similar situation occurred in 2023. Cardano again consolidated within a parallel channel, marking the end of another bear market. After this period of stagnation, the ADA price broke out of the channel with a 72% surge. Now, Cardano is undergoing a 50% price correction.







Martinez believes that while history doesn’t repeat itself, it often rhymes. Per his thread, if this rule holds true for Cardano, investors should prepare for what lies ahead. He adds that the current price correction could be one of the last opportunities to buy ADA at a low price before a new parabolic rise.



Of course, it’s important to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results. Technical analysis is a powerful tool, but it doesn’t provide 100% certainty; as usual, investors should always conduct their own research and weigh potential risks and rewards before making investment decisions.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

On April 18, Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation, revealed plans for a new governance structure for the Cardano blockchain, marking a critical development phase. The Cardano Foundation, headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, plays a vital role in overseeing the Cardano ecosystem. It focuses on various functions, including adoption, shaping policy, community expansion, ensuring stakeholder accountability, and fostering partnerships.



Gregaard announced the creation of an interim constitution aimed at laying the foundation for decentralized governance, underlining the importance of community involvement in determining the future of the ecosystem. This constitution encapsulates the core values of the global Cardano community, promoting transparency, openness, and responsible decision-making. It also ensures that every ADA holder has a voice in the ecosystem, making the governance structure inclusive and representative.



Additionally, the interim constitution outlines the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of all ADA holders, developers, and community members, emphasizing a fair voting system to maintain true ownership and participation. Gregaard also discussed the introduction of checks and balances within the governance system, involving delegates, stake pool operators, and a constitutional committee to reflect community will, uphold the constitution, and protect the ecosystem’s integrity.



The governance model is currently in a testing phase, with plans for a final constitution to be developed through global workshops and a constitutional convention in late 2024. These initiatives are intended to engage the community actively in refining governance strategies. Gregaard sees the constitution as evolving with the community and is enthusiastic about the future of Cardano’s governance, highlighting the blockchain’s model as an industry benchmark.

New York Resident Charged in $43 Million Crypto-Related Ponzi Scheme


																A New York court and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have revealed an indictment against Idin Dalpour.
The 39-year-old New York resident is accused of organizing a sophisticated Ponzi scheme that allegedly defrauded investors of $43 million.
$43 Million Ponzi Scheme
According to the indictment, he ran the Ponzi scheme from approximately 2020 through April 2024. He targeted investors in the United States and abroad, soliciting investments through an entity he controlled called “Entity-1.”
This entity had interests in two business ventures: a cryptocurrency trading operation and a Las Vegas hospitality enterprise. Dalpour falsely claimed to purchase cryptocurrency at wholesale prices and sell it at a profit to retail investors promising substantial returns with assurances of safety and insurance for their investments.
He also claimed Entity-1 had deals with a management company and a top Las Vegas hotel to rent condos to visitors.




Investors were lured into the scheme with promises of substantial returns, with initial rates advertised at 42% per year. Dalpour allegedly provided investors with fabricated contracts, email correspondence, and bank statements to support his false claims about the profitability and legitimacy of the ventures.
The indictment outlines that Dalpour did not use investors’ funds as promised. Instead, he used the money contributed by later investors to pay earlier participants their returns.
Dalpour also reportedly used investor funds for personal expenses, including gambling losses totaling approximately $1.7 million, expenditures from Art Direct amounting to over $400,000, and private school tuition for his children.
When investors sought to recover their investments, he reportedly provided false explanations, including claims of frozen funds due to a hack of the Hotel’s servers and non-existent bank accounts.
Dalpour Faces Upto 20 Years in Prison
The indictment also details a confrontation in November 2023, where Dalpour reportedly confessed to lying about the operation of the Las Vegas hospitality business, the misuse of investor funds, and the fabrication of contracts and bank records.
During this encounter, Dalpour said, “What you already have, you have, you can put me in jail now, like right now.”
Dalpour’s arrest marks a significant step in the investigation, If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for wire fraud.
The Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force of the Southern District of New York is handling the case. Dalpour will appear in Manhattan federal court before U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Moses.

Automobile Giant Tesla Updated Payment Information: There is New Dogecoin Detail - Bitcoin Sistemi


Tesla, one of the world's largest electric car manufacturers, also included Dogecoin (DOGE) detail in an update made in the payment section of its official website.
According to the official website, American Express, Discover, Mastercard, Visa and Apple Pay payment options are used when purchasing Tesla products. However, Tesla also stated in the note he added that Dogecoin can be used for some products.


According to the cryptocurrency community, Dogecoin was not previously mentioned among the payment options. However, DOGE cannot be used to purchase Tesla cars. It can only be used to purchase certain products.

Users who want to purchase Tesla products with DOGE are given a price showing the DOGE equivalent of the product for a certain period of time, but this is valid for a short time. The price needs to be updated after some time. It is known that the reason for this is the volatility of DOGE.





However, it is not currently possible to purchase any of Tesla products with Bitcoin. For a while, even Tesla cars could be purchased with BTC.

Dogecoin Price Slides Amidst Crypto Market Correction, But Will it Bounce Back and Take on Shiba Inu?



                    

Dogecoin‘s value has taken a hit amidst a broader decline in the cryptocurrency market. On April 27, DOGE saw a decrease of 4.82%, settling at approximately $0.15.



This decline was more pronounced compared to the overall crypto market, which experienced a 2.25% drop on the same day. 




Over the past month, Dogecoin has plummeted by 38% from its recent peak of $0.229.



The recent downturn in Dogecoin’s price can be attributed to several factors, with one significant influence being the release of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) report on April 25. 



The U.S. economy’s growth in the first quarter of 2024 fell short of expectations, recording a 1.6% increase instead of the anticipated 2.5%. 



Additionally, there was only a 0.3% rise in personal consumption expenditures for March.



Consequently, expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2024 have been revised down to just 33 basis points, a considerable reduction from earlier projections.



The anticipation of sustained high interest rates has led to a rise in the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note, reaching 4.739% on April 24, its highest level in five months. 



This increase has made riskier crypto assets less appealing to investors. For instance, on the day when the yield peaked, five spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced outflows totaling $217 million.

Furthermore, Dogecoin’s open interest (OI) has declined to $865.63 million on April 27 from its peak of $2.21 billion nearly a month ago. 




Additionally, the funding rate has dropped to 0.0063% per eight hours. 



These developments indicate a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market, with traders adopting a cautious stance due to uncertainty surrounding Dogecoin’s future price movements or reduced interest in high leverage trading.



Today’s decrease in Dogecoin’s price appears to be a continuation of a selling trend that started when the price encountered resistance marked by a descending trendline and the 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA). 



The descending trendline resistance has consistently hindered DOGE’s upward movements over the past 30 days. 



Currently, the cryptocurrency is testing its multi-week ascending trendline support, suggesting a potential rebound that could propel the price towards the descending trendline resistance at around $0.159 by the end of April.

$2,000,000,000,000 - $3,000,000,000,000 Wealth Transfer Happening This Year As ‘Largest Move of Assets in World History’ Approaches Climax: Report - The Daily Hodl


								Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young (EY) says the greatest transfer of wealth in human history is in motion, with trillions of dollars in assets passed down this year.
In its Global Wealth Management Industry Report, EY estimates baby boomers will hand down up to $3 trillion in assets to their kin this year.










EY expects the “tidal wave” of wealth transfer from baby boomers to their families to continue until the dawn of a new decade.
“It can be estimated that US$2 trillion – $3 trillion will be inherited from wealthy donors during 2024; in many markets, tens or even hundreds of billions [of dollars] will change hands this year. In 2023, more billionaires were created by inheritance than by entrepreneurship.
The inheritance of baby boomers’ wealth is not only the largest transfer of assets in world history; it will also have a transformative effect on female and next-generation inheritors. Wealthy donors will pass a staggering US$18 trillion, roughly equivalent to the annual GDP of China, to beneficiaries by 2030.” 
The firm’s $18 trillion wealth transfer is significantly lower than estimates released by other firms. Global real estate consultancy firm Knight Frank believes baby boomers will pass down $90 trillion to millennials in the next two decades while others estimate the number to be between $53 trillion and $84 trillion.
Amid the “unprecedented” movement of assets, EY warns that the beneficiaries are not equipped with the necessary knowledge, experience and network to manage their new-found wealth.
“No two clients are alike, but many wealthy donors have features in common. Most are male, aged 70 or over, have benefited from decades of favorable markets and have long-standing wealth manager relationships.
In contrast, inheritors’ needs and values – and banking relationships – are far more diverse and underserved.
The first beneficiaries are often female, frequently with less exposure to managing wealth. This is a client segment whose requirements and preferences have often been less well-served than their male counterparts in the past. Younger generations, too, typically have very different goals from older donors. This includes factors such as the internationalization of wealthy families, less traditional family structures, lower financial literacy and more idiosyncratic investment beliefs.”

New Solana Memecoin Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE) to Surge 7,100% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Skinny Doge presents a similar opportunity.



Skinny Doge has market cap below $13,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,100% in the coming two days, and Skinny Doge could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Skinny Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Skinny Doge on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Skinny Doge by entering its contract address – 913qkdtENF3qvSBZjtoNxETZi93xHgRDuHNGvdzkECF4 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SKINDOGE.

itcoin: The Teenage Prodigy of the Financial World? | Cryptoglobe


                                
Introduction In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, shared an intriguing description of Bitcoin, originally coined by Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg. The metaphor, “It’s like gold, but as a teenager,” sparked an engaging discussion among followers, shedding light on the unique characteristics and potential of the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency.



Balchunas’ comparison of Bitcoin to a teenage version of gold is a fascinating way to frame the digital asset’s position in the financial landscape. Gold has long been considered a reliable store of value, with a history of stability and resilience during economic turmoil. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a relatively new player in the world of finance, having emerged in 2009.



Much like a teenager, Bitcoin is still growing, learning, and experiencing the volatility that comes with maturation. Its value fluctuates more dramatically than that of gold, and it is subject to the whims and speculations of a rapidly evolving market. However, just as a teenager holds immense potential for growth and development, Bitcoin has the capacity to revolutionize the way we think about money and transactions.



One insightful reply to Geraci’s post took the metaphor a step further, painting a picture of Bitcoin as the son of gold, a father who “had issues and paid no attention to his son.” This poignant analogy highlights the challenges Bitcoin has faced in its journey to legitimacy and widespread adoption.



Unlike gold, which has the backing of governments and centuries of trust, Bitcoin had to forge its own path. It emerged from the shadows of the internet, born out of a desire for a decentralized, transparent, and secure financial system. Bitcoin’s growth has been marked by trial and error, with the cryptocurrency community learning from its mistakes and adapting to the ever-changing landscape of digital assets.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Balchunas’ response to the father-son analogy likened Bitcoin to Generation X in 1994. This comparison is apt, as it reflects the rebellious and innovative spirit that defines both Gen X and Bitcoin. In the early 1990s, Gen X was coming of age, challenging the status quo, and embracing new technologies that would shape the future.



Similarly, Bitcoin emerged as a disruptive force in the world of finance, offering an alternative to traditional banking systems and fiat currencies. Its decentralized nature and the underlying blockchain technology have the potential to revolutionize not only financial transactions but also various industries, from supply chain management to voting systems.



The metaphor of Bitcoin as a teenage version of gold resonated with many readers, with one commenter noting that it “not only makes Bitcoin more relatable but also encapsulates its dynamic and transformative nature in the financial landscape.” As Bitcoin continues to mature and gain acceptance, it has the potential to reshape the way we think about money and value.



Another reply highlighted the similarities between Bitcoin and gold as a store of value, stating that while gold is more established and stable, Bitcoin similarly appeals to those seeking alternative investments.

Shiba Inu Community Alert: TREAT Token Release Misinformation Sparks Urgent Caution



                    

The Shiba Inu community is currently on high alert due to the spread of misinformation surrounding the release of the TREAT token. 



Shibarmy Scam Alerts, a dedicated source for uncovering scams within the community, has issued an urgent warning. 




They emphasize that the TREAT token has not been officially launched and refute recent claims suggesting otherwise. 



According to them, the SHIB team has not initiated any official release of the token. As a precautionary measure, the Shiba Inu community is urged to exercise caution and refrain from participating in any transactions or investments related to TREAT until its official release is confirmed by legitimate sources. 



It is advised to safeguard assets by avoiding unauthorized TREAT-related activities and prioritizing financial security.




In recent developments, Shiba Inu has secured $12 million from strategic VC partners led by Cypher Capital to facilitate the launch of its next-generation Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) blockchain, which will be powered by the forthcoming TREAT token. 



READ MORE: Bitcoin Holds Firm Above $63,000 Despite Regulatory Scrutiny and Economic Turbulence



The FHE technology, enabling computations on encrypted data, promises significant advancements in privacy and trust within the cryptocurrency sphere. 



However, amidst the anticipation, there are considerable risks associated with the TREAT token, prompting the issuance of the urgent alert.




The Shiba Inu community is reminded to disregard any claims of the TREAT token’s release, as no such action has been initiated by the SHIB team. 



Official announcements should be relied upon for accurate information regarding the TREAT launch. 



In other significant news for the ecosystem, the decentralized exchange ShibaSwap has completed its migration to Shibarium from Ethereum, marking a milestone in its progress. 



This move is expected to bring forth innovations and new possibilities for the ShibaSwap platform within the Shibarium blockchain environment.

Crypto Venture Capital Trends: Q1 2024 Analysis by Galaxy Digital Research | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent research report titled “Crypto & Blockchain Venture Capital – Q1 2024” by Galaxy Digital, it was highlighted that while digital asset markets have shown significant recovery from the lows of 2023, venture capital investment in the sector has not kept pace with previous bull market trends. Galaxy Digital noted that venture capital dollars are trailing, unlike in the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, where there was a high correlation with liquid crypto asset prices. Several factors contribute to this stagnation, including high interest rates, which dampen risk appetite, a lingering reluctance in the crypto market following the 2022 blowups, and a scarcity of later-stage companies capable of absorbing large venture investments. As a result, early-stage companies have attracted the most interest, both in terms of capital and deal count, with a modest quarter-on-quarter increase in total capital invested and a 50% rise in deal count, mainly at the Series A stage or earlier.



Galaxy Digital’s report also points out that the trend towards early-stage investment is a positive indicator for the long-term health of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. These companies are often at the forefront of developing new technologies, including scaling solutions, games, and tools that integrate artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Despite challenges in raising capital for later-stage ventures, the flourishing of innovative projects suggests a vibrant and evolving landscape.



The introduction of spot-based Bitcoin ETFs in the United States is another focal point of the report. According to Galaxy Digital, these ETFs provide an accessible, low-fee, and highly liquid means for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. However, this ease of access could potentially divert interest away from crypto startups, as these ETFs fulfill some investors’ need for exposure to the crypto market, potentially impacting venture investments in crypto-linked equities.



With regards to specific blockchain technologies, Galaxy Digital highlights significant venture capital interest in Bitcoin Layer 2 projects during Q1 2024. The development of new token standards on Bitcoin, such as BRC-20 and Runes, and the application of technologies pioneered in the Ethereum ecosystem, like optimistic and zk rollups, have piqued investor interest. This shift views Bitcoin not just as a monetary system but as a platform network supporting a variety of applications.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The report by Galaxy Digital further explores the distribution of venture capital across different sectors within the blockchain space. While Web3 and Trading categories continue to dominate in terms of deal count and capital raised, the Infrastructure category has seen substantial growth, becoming the leader in capital raised and second in deal count in Q1 2024. This includes investments in tools like staking, re-staking services, and platform tools, with notable rounds such as EigenLayer’s $100 million financing.



Moreover, Galaxy Digital comments on the challenges faced by fund managers in the current economic climate, noting a downturn in the size of funds and the capital allocated to them since the tumult of 2022. However, a slight uptick in the number of new funds indicates emerging opportunities and continued growth in crypto prices and adoption could rejuvenate investor confidence and funding activities.



Finally, the United States remains at the forefront of the crypto startup ecosystem, though regulatory challenges could potentially drive some operations overseas. Galaxy Digital underscores the importance of thoughtful policymaking to maintain the U.S. as a hub for technological innovation and to support the continuing development of the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem.

Veteran Analyst Peter Brandt: 8 Trading Tips for Crypto Traders


A seasoned market analyst, Peter Brandt, offers a rigorous guide for those looking to dive full-time into crypto trading. 
With years of trading experience, Brandt outlines essential tips aimed at aspiring traders who wish to transition from day jobs to trading as their primary source of income.
8 Tips for Crypto Traders by Peter Brandt
Firstly, Brandt emphasizes the importance of genuine trading skills over luck. Aspiring crypto traders should rely on their abilities rather than hoping a single market bet will pay off. He advises traders to ensure they have substantial account capital. 
“Multiply your needed living expenses by five,” Brandt suggests, highlighting the need for financial stability derived from actual profits, not loans or savings.
Additionally, Brandt stresses the importance of having enough savings outside one’s trading account to cover living expenses for up to two years. This is crucial considering the possibility of losing money in the first year. 

“[Novice traders] risk way too much of the $100,000 per trade. Risking more much more than 2% per trade is a recipe for failure. The only solution in my mind is a commitment to a marathon and not a sprint,” Brandt added.

Brandt also recommends paper trading for at least a year to refine one’s trading approach, focusing on the minute details that often determine success or failure.
Understanding the low success rate among crypto traders is also vital. Only about 3% to 5% of those who try to trade full-time actually succeed, according to Brandt. He challenges traders, saying, “Prove me wrong, and then let me know where I was wrong after two years.”
Brandt also tackles a common misconception in trading. Especially the need for a large starting capital. He argues that success in trading does not correlate with the size of one’s capital. In fact, starting small can help traders quickly identify and rectify mistakes, which is crucial in the steep learning process of trading.


“There is a huge misconception that an aspiring trader needs a big account to be successful. Most “market wizards” would tell you that if you cannot be profitable with a small amt of capital, then you won’t be profitable with more. Actually, with a smaller account mistakes become self apparent sooner. Successful trading occurs when a person climbs a steep wall of learning by making mistakes,” Brandt concluded.

Brandt’s insights provide a robust framework for crypto traders aiming to make a significant shift in their professional lives, emphasizing that successful trading is about solving problems and learning from mistakes, not just having a strong start.

Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) to Rally Over 13,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kitty With Hat (KITHAT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kitty With Hat (KITHAT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 13,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KITHAT will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kitty With Hat.



Currently, Kitty With Hat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KITHAT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – 3Wdkgv1iTBQQ9MnvA4TkAefe2SLdtSKfHwZbhKcEMZk8 – in the receiving field.




KITHAT currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

The Top Layer 2 Networks by Development Activity in April


																While the crypto market witnessed significant bloodshed in April, layer-2 networks recorded substantial developer activity, signaling a strong belief in these projects despite the latest slumps in the value of their native tokens.
A tweet by crypto data analytics platform Santiment revealed that the top ten layer-2 networks were selected by counting each project’s non-redundant GitHub activity and averaging their daily activity over the past 30 days.
According to Santiment, analysts obtained the projects’ GitHub activities from their repositories through a back-tested process to ensure that only the teams’ efforts to improve and innovate were included. A project’s GitHub activity can be used to determine whether the team is actively working on the protocol. High developer activity could also reduce the probability that a project is an exit scam.
Through Santiment’s methodology, analysts discovered that Ethereum-based scaling protocol Optimism emerged as the top network with the highest developer activity of 541.33 commits, 146% more than the next project. Conversely, its native token, OP, plunged more than 17% in the last 30 days.
Following Optimism is the permissionless decentralized zero knowledge-rollup network Starknet, which recorded a developer activity of 220.23. Despite Starknet’s high activity, its native token, STRK, lost roughly 36% of its value in April.




Arbitrum came third with a developer activity of 110.77, while its native asset, ARB, fell 32% within the same period. Next is the modular scaling protocol Cartesi, Immutable X, and Skale Network, which came fourth, fifth, and sixth, with developer activities of 56.97, 49.07, and 28.07, respectively. Their native assets also witnessed notable declines, running into double digits.
The last four projects on the list are Bitcoin layer-2 sidechain MintLayer, and Ethereum-based networks Polygon, MetisDAO, and Mantle, with developer activities of 23.53, 20.43, 7.87, and 5.33. Like other projects, their native tokens also recorded substantial losses in April.

Shiba Inu Scores Another Major Listing That Could Send Price Flying


								Shiba Inu has scored another major listing as PayPal users within the United States can now buy the dog-themed cryptocurrency through MoonPay, opening up new avenues for adoption and potentially fueling a price increase. 
PayPal Teams Up With MoonPay For Shiba Inu Access
American multinational financial technology company PayPal has made a strategic partnership with MoonPay, a crypto payment platform, allowing US users to access cryptocurrency assets like Shiba Inu. MoonPay made the exciting announcement on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that PayPal can now offer seamless fiat-to-crypto transactions within the US. 

The integration of MoonPay’s services into PayPal marks a significant milestone in the democratization of cryptocurrencies in the US. MoonPay has disclosed that it will allow PayPal users to purchase over 110 cryptocurrencies, including doggy-themed cryptocurrency, Shiba Inu. 
Through the collaboration, millions of users in all 50 states of the US will be exposed to Shiba Inu tokens, presenting a step forward in the cryptocurrency’s vision for mainstream adoption. This could in turn potentially drive up the price of the cryptocurrency as it attracts new investors from different parts of the country. 
Moreover, after the announcement of the partnership, the price of Shiba Inu surged considerably. The cryptocurrency jumped from $0.000022 to $0.000024 in just a day, increasing by 7.72% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. 
MoonPay has outlined the process for users to access its extensive library of cryptocurrencies via PayPal, disclosing that new MoonPay users with a PayPal account can seamlessly conduct online cryptocurrency transactions. 

Bitcoin is now trading at $63.866. Chart: TradingView
The crypto payment platform disclosed that PayPal users can fund their crypto accounts through different channels including direct bank withdrawal, PayPal balance, and debit card. 
Welcoming the pivotal partnership, MoonPay’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Ivan Soto-Wright, emphasized the importance of the alliance, aimed at facilitating broader cryptocurrency adoption within familiar ecosystems. 
He disclosed that MoonPay’s integration into PayPal underscores the crypto platform’s deep commitment to expanding access to cryptocurrencies through trusted networks.
MoonPay Set To Transform PayPal Crypto Access
Including Shiba Inu, MoonPay will also grant PayPal users within the US access to top cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitcoin (BTC), and others. Additionally, the crypto service platform has revealed that other crypto assets initially available on its platform such as Pepe (PEPE), Cosmos (ATOM), Toncoin (TON), Binance Coin (BNB) and a few more, will not be accessible to US users. 
MoonPay has also revealed key benefits it will be offering PayPal through its crypto services, including flexible payment methods, an extensive variety of cryptocurrencies, seamless onboarding, transactional speed, and other user-friendly features. 

Furthermore, the crypto platform has hinted that in the third quarter (Q3) of 2024, it plans to integrate PayPal into its partner networks, expanding opportunities for the adoption of cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu, which could potentially boost the token’s value.

New Global Currency Designed To Ditch US Dollar, Avert Sanctions Emerging As BRICS Leaders Prepare To Meet: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A group of economically-aligned nations known as BRICS is reportedly hammering out the details on a new currency designed to drop dependence on the US dollar.
South African Ambassador to China Siyabonga Cyprian Cwele says BRICS members will meet this month to discuss the specifics, reports the Chinese state-backed Global Times.










On the agenda is a debate on whether a digital currency would effectively facilitate global trade and settlement while reducing the risk of sanctions.
“The BRICS are advancing the progress of its common currency, while actively promoting the use of local currencies from member states to reduce the risks of solely relying on the US dollar…
Cwele stressed the importance of supporting the use of local currencies with open financial data sharing, while looking into digital currencies as ways to explore multiple and stable mechanisms for trade and settlement to reduce the risks such as sanction by just relying on a singular currency.”
The push for a new currency comes amid a period of expansion for BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
Last year, the organization added Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.
And according to Cwele, more than 20 additional countries have now “expressed an interest” in joining.
Cwele says BRICS leaders are working to create new guidelines for adding additional countries that are non-discriminatory and address issues aside from economics.

CZ gets jail sentence, Gensler viewed Ether as security, and FBI targets mixers: Hodler’s Digest, April 28 - May 4 - Cointelegraph Magazine


            
Top Stories This Week



Ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao sentenced to four months in prison



Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has been sentenced to four months in prison for failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at the cryptocurrency exchange. The sentence was delivered by Judge Richard Jones in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on April 30, following Zhao’s guilty plea in November. Although prosecutors initially sought a three-year prison term, Judge Jones decided on a shorter sentence, noting that there was no evidence Zhao was directly informed of specific illegal activities at Binance.



SEC and Gensler believed Ether was security for at least a year



The lawsuit filed by Consensys against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revealed details about the Commission’s view of Ether as a security. Based on court documents, the SEC and its chair, Gary Gensler, have reportedly considered Ether to be an “unregistered security” not in compliance with federal regulations for at least a year. The revelation is part of Consensys response to a Wells notice from the SEC with an unredacted complaint in a Texas federal court.



FBI warning against crypto money transmitters ‘appears’ to be aimed at mixers



An advisory issued by U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation against using unregistered cryptocurrency money-transmitting services may be targeting smart-contract privacy tools, according to legal professionals. On April 25, the FBI issued a public service announcement advising Americans to only use registered crypto businesses that adhere to Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations. The FBI highlighted that it had taken action against unlicensed cryptocurrency services, warning that users of such services could face financial disruptions, especially if their funds are mixed with those obtained illegally.







Bitcoin post-halving price consolidation could last 2 months — Bitfinex



Bitfinex analysts predict that Bitcoin may enter a one to two-month period of price consolidation following the halving event, with potential price fluctuations of up to $10,000. According to the report, Bitcoin is expected to remain a key benchmark for price action in the crypto market throughout May and serve as a primary indicator for the overall market cap. Lastly, the report adds that any positive impact on Bitcoin’s price following the halving will be seen in later months.

Prediction of the week



Bitcoin bottom in, now headed for a ‘slow grind higher’ — Arthur Hayes



Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes believes Bitcoin has hit a local bottom and will slowly grind back up over the next few months. In a blog post on May 3, Hayes commented on the recent market slump, claiming that “The price action played out as I expected.”



Bitcoin hit a local low of around $58,600 earlier this week but will rally to above $60,000 and then remain rangebound between $60,000 and $70,000 until August, he said.



Hayes expects crypto markets to slowly grind higher after the recent sell-off, driven by increased dollar liquidity from the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening taper and the U.S. Treasury’s debt issuance plans.



“The slow addition of billions of dollars of liquidity each month will dampen negative price movement from here on out,” he added before predicting that prices will “bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher.”







FUD of the Week

Bitcoin Relative Strength Jumps To 40%: 10x Research Reveals Next Steps From Here


                            Crypto research platform 10x Research recently noted that the Bitcoin Relative Strength has jumped to 40%. In line with this, they provided insights into what major moves the flagship crypto might make soon enough. 
What Next For Bitcoin?
In their newsletter titled “Fake Dip?” 10x Research drew the crypto community’s attention to the fact that Bitcoin has historically experienced potential rallies whenever its relative strength index (RSI) drops to 40%. As such, there is the possibility that BTC could again rally following its recent decline. 

The research platform warned that a “line in the sand” at the $62,000 mark could keep the flagship crypto from rallying. However, Bitcoin has already broken above that level, which could mean there is still a bullish sentiment around the crypto token. 
Meanwhile, the research hinted that BTC would need a catalyst to enjoy a sustained rally. They highlighted four bullish events that helped Bitcoin enjoy a parabolic run soon after breaking a vital support level. These events included Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s bid for uncapped deposit insurance, BlackRock’s application for a Spot Bitcoin ETF, Franklin Templeton also filing for a Spot Bitcoin ETF, and when US Core PCE dropped below 3.0%.
This echoes the sentiment of Andrey Stoychev, Head of Prime Brokerage at Nexo, who previously mentioned that Bitcoin would need a catalyst to make a significant move to the upside. He predicts that Bitcoin will only continue to trade around the $67,000 range without this catalyst. 
10x Research didn’t sound optimistic about BTC enjoying a sustained rally, as their trend model indicates that the flagship crypto is in a downtrend. Despite that, they are not ruling out the possibility of BTC experiencing a bullish reversal. The research firm also revealed that they would look to buy the dip if Bitcoin drops significantly or rallies from here. 
BTC Still Destined To Hit New Highs
Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto recently suggested that Bitcoin will still hit new highs. He stated that Bitcoin’s current price action is meant to create “more fear across the market and then bottom for upward continuation.” Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also recently suggested that the bull run was far from over, bearing in mind that Bitcoin consolidated around this period in the last two bull runs. 

He claimed that BTC might be over 500 days away from hitting its market top for this cycle. As to how BTC could rise, Martinez mentioned that it could hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $92,190 if it breaches the resistance level of $69,150. It is also worth noting that crypto analyst PlanB stated that Bitcoin hitting $100,000 this year is “inevitable.”
At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around at around $63,500, up over 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Solana Primed To Establish Itself As ‘Third Major Crypto Asset’ After Bitcoin and Ethereum: Franklin Templeton - The Daily Hodl


								Global investment giant Franklin Templeton thinks Solana (SOL) is primed to establish itself as the “third major crypto asset” after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).
In a new analysis, the firm’s digital assets unit notes that the Solana network has witnessed significant increases in total fees and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes in the past year.










“We expect this growth to continue as Solana’s network effects grow stronger and its network performance improves even more, positioning itself to capture the next trends in crypto. The network has proven to have some of the lowest fees, lowest transaction latency and highest data throughput relative to other networks. This is where Solana really shines.”
SOL is trading at $143.34 at time of writing. The fifth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 3% in the past 24 hours but down more than 22% in the past month.
Franklin Templeton also believes Solana is “uniquely qualified” to serve as the focal point of adoption for several sectors in the crypto space, including decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN), payments, compression non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and centralized limit order books (CLOBs). In addition, the investment titan sees activity in the Solana network surging in the coming months due to potential airdrops and the resurgence of memecoin mania.
“Further, the Solana ecosystem has more expected airdrops in the coming months which should continue adding a wealth effect to the ecosystem. And memecoin activity has shown no signs of slowing down on the network.”

Grayscale Spot Bitcoin ETF Turns Positive After $17.5 Billion In Outflows, Sees Inflows For The First Time | Bitcoinist.com


								In a rather shocking development, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has recorded its first-ever inflow after witnessing significant daily outflows since its launch. 
Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Records Over $60 Million In Inflows
Grayscale’s Spot Bitcoin ETF has finally broken its 82-day streak of outflows since its launch on January 11, 2024. GBTC saw its first day of inflows on May 3, after witnessing approximately $17.46 billion in outflows. 

According to data from Farside, an investment management firm, Grayscale’s Spot Bitcoin ETF had amassed inflows of about $63 million, alongside other Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) which had inflows of $12.7 million. 
The total inflows recorded in that single day amounted to approximately $378.3 million, with Franklin Templeton’s Spot Bitcoin ETF, EZBC, leading the pack with the highest inflows of $102.6 million. 
Expressing disbelief at Grayscale’s turnaround, Bloomberg senior analyst and ETF expert, Eric Balchunas remarked that he had to make thorough verifications to confirm the unexpected development. 
Moreover, the surprising influx comes after a recent occurrence which saw 10 US Spot Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT, collectively recording enormous outflows worth over $563.7 million in a single day. These outflows were possibly triggered by the Federal Reserve’s (FED) decision to keep rates unaltered, resulting in a broader downturn in the crypto market. 
BTC had also experienced significant declines around the same time, however, currently the cryptocurrency is up by 6.36% in the past 24 hours, jumping above $60,000 support levels to trade at $63,175, according to CoinMarketCap. 
Factors Behind GBTC’s Massive Outflows
Grayscale saw its first recorded inflow after experiencing hundreds of millions worth of daily outflows since its inception. The asset management firm’s Spot Bitcoin ETF had also experienced its highest outflow of approximately $589.9 million on February 29. 

Various factors have contributed to GBTC’s daily outflows, including its exorbitant annual management fee of 1.5%. Compared to all 12 Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States (US), Grayscale has the most expensive Spot Bitcoin ETF fee, exceeding even BlackRock, the second largest BTC ETF provider, which has an average annual management fee of 0.25%. 
Some of Grayscale’s outflows were also a result of a reported selling connection with insolvent crypto exchange, FTX and other defunct cryptocurrency companies. FTX had sold about $1 billion worth of GBTC while Genesis, a cryptocurrency brokerage for institutional investors had sold almost 36 million shares in GBTC to purchase 32,041 BTC worth more than $2.1 billion.

OpenAI Faces Privacy Complaint Over Chatbot Accuracy Concerns



                    

OpenAI, a leading developer in artificial intelligence (AI), finds itself embroiled in a privacy complaint brought forth by Noyb, a data rights protection advocacy group based in Austria.



Noyb launched the complaint on April 29, alleging that OpenAI has neglected to address erroneous information generated by its AI chatbot, ChatGPT. 




The group contends that this inaction may violate privacy regulations within the European Union (EU).



The complaint stems from an incident involving an unidentified public figure who sought information about themselves from OpenAI’s chatbot. 



Despite repeated requests, OpenAI purportedly declined to rectify or delete the inaccurate data, citing technical limitations. 




Furthermore, the company refused to disclose details about its training data and its origins.



Maartje de Graaf, a data protection lawyer at Noyb, emphasized the importance of adherence to legal standards in technology, stating, 



“If a system cannot produce accurate and transparent results, it cannot be used to generate data about individuals.

Noyb escalated the complaint to the Austrian data protection authority, urging an investigation into OpenAI’s data processing practices and the mechanisms it employs to ensure the accuracy of personal data processed by its large language models.



De Graaf underscored the current challenges faced by companies in aligning chatbot technologies like ChatGPT with EU data protection laws.



Noyb, also known as the European Center for Digital Rights, operates out of Vienna, Austria, with a mission to support European General Data Protection Regulation laws through strategic legal actions and media initiatives.



This incident adds to a growing concern surrounding the accuracy and compliance of chatbot technologies. 



In a similar vein, in December 2023, a study revealed issues with Microsoft’s Bing AI chatbot, now called Copilot, providing misleading information during political elections in Germany and Switzerland. 



Additionally, Google’s Gemini AI chatbot faced criticism for generating inaccurate imagery, prompting the company to issue an apology and commit to model updates.

BitFinex Under Threat? Hackers Allege Access to 400K Accounts - DailyCoin


        
FSOCIETY sparked panic by claiming to have compromised BitFinex. 



Initially, security researchers authenticated the hack, citing a match with some leaked passwords.



BitFinex CTO Paolo Ardoino chimed in, casting doubt on the hack. 
Notorious hacking group FSOCIETY, styled after the crew in the hit TV show Mr. Robot, claimed successful hacks on several victims on its dark web homepage, which included crypto exchange BitFinex. Their hacking group claimed to possess terabytes of users’ data from the exchange and threatened to release it, plunging users into panic. Yet, as users scrambled to safeguard their accounts, FSOCIETY’s credibility waned, leaving many questioning if they were just another group crying wolf.BitFinex Hacked?On April 25, FSociety proudly announced on the dark web that it compromised over 400,000 BitFinex accounts, grasping over 2.5 terabytes of user data. The hacking group issued a seven-day ultimatum for the exchange to reach out, backing up their claim by leaking a text file containing a partial dump of usernames and plaintext passwords. 
But it didn’t stop there. FSociety upped the ante by threatening to unleash the KYC details of all users if their demands weren’t met promptly. As the clock ticked down, chaos rippled through BitFinex’s user base. In a frenzy to validate the breach, security researchers tested the leaked passwords, triggering 2FA prompts and sending a wave of urgency for users to change their credentials.Amid the panic, Paolo Ardoino, BitFinex’s CTO and CEO of Tether, chimed in, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the hack.BitFinex CTO Clears the AirAfter a week of panic, Ardoino offered some relief on Friday, clarifying that the data originated from another breach and not from BitFinex. The executive also revealed that the hackers never reached out for ransom.
The BitFinex CTO detailed that FSociety’s data contained 22,500 records of emails and passwords, of which only 5,000 were linked to BitFinex users. Ardonio also emphasized that the exchange didn’t store passwords in plaintext. He also highlighted that if any real information had been compromised, they would have been contacted through their bug bounty program, customer support ticket system, emails, or Twitter.https://x.com/paoloardoino/status/1786751936760312050Shinoji Research linked the emails to the recent CoinMarketCap breach, asserting that the compromised accounts had a significant presence on HaveIBeenPwned, a website that indicates if your email has been compromised.Ardoino maintained that BitFinex found no breaches after a deep analysis of its system. In a separate tweet, he unveiled FSociety’s motives, claiming the ransomware group aimed to promote its ransomware tool and share profits with subscribers.Ardoino questioned, "If they truly hacked BitFinex, do they really need to sell stuff for $299?"On the Flipside
The panic surrounding Bitfinex stems from its notorious hack in 2016. Two individuals pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in connection with the hack, surrendering over 95,000 Bitcoin to the government.



Losses due to crypto hacks dropped by 67% in April to $60.2 million, marking a notable reduction in crypto attacks, representing the first significant decline in 2024.

Ethereum's $35 million shake-up: How ETH's 7% hike triggered a 2-month high - AMBCrypto



ETH’s price appreciated by over 5% on 3 May
This contributed to a hike in the number of short positions liquidated

Ethereum’s [ETH] 7% price rally during the intraday trading session on 3 May caused short liquidations on its derivatives market to rally to a two-month high, according to Coinglass. 
In fact, the on-chain data provider went on to reveal that on that day, $35 million worth of ETH’s short positions were liquidated. In comparison, long liquidations totalled just $7.16 million. 
Source: Coinglass
Liquidations happen in an asset’s derivatives market when a trader’s position is forcefully closed due to insufficient funds to maintain it. Short liquidations occur when the value of an asset suddenly rises, and traders who have open positions in favor of a price decline are forced to exit their positions. 
According to Santiment’s data, the altcoin closed on 3 May above $3000 after trading below that price level since the beginning of the month.
Derivatives market traders stay their hands
Still extending its gains at press time, ETH’s price was up by over 5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the market-leading altcoin was valued at $3,104. 
Here, it’s worth noting that Coinglass data also suggested that the price rally has not instigated any significant activity in ETH’s derivatives market. In fact, trading volume in that market grew by just 2%.

Similarly, the coin’s Futures open interest recorded a minor 3% hike over the same period. ETH’s Futures open interest was $10.68 billion at press time. Furthermore, ETH’s Options volume cratered by over 50% during the period under review.
 Options trading grants participants the right to buy or sell an asset at a specified date. Generally, when ETH sees a decline in its Options volume, it means that there is less speculation on its future price movements as market participants wait to see where the coin’s market might be heading next. 
A combined reading of the minor hike in ETH’s Futures trading volume and its declining Options volume suggests that the coin’s derivatives market participants have adopted a “wait and see” approach. Simply put, they are not placing significant bets on where its price might head next.

Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Challenger Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) Will Surge 7,000% Within 48 Hours



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Telegram Becoming Crypto-Based Everything App, What Will Happen to TON?


After months of Elon Musk teasing about turning X into an "everything app" and introducing peer-to-peer crypto payments in 2024, Telegram is now making waves as the first major platform to embrace the Web3 ecosystem.In a recent interview with Tucker Carlson, the founder of Telegram praised Musk for his innovative mindset and efforts to build the SocialFi platform, aiming to empower content creators with fair ad revenue returns.SocialFi represents a fusion of social media and decentralized finance (DeFi), offering users control over their content without reliance on central authority. Creators retain ownership of their content and data, unlike in Web2 platforms. Users can monetize their engagement and following without limitations, opening up new financial opportunities.With Telegram's recent adoption of TON, Tether and other features, the platform has garnered more attention from the crypto community than ever before.Does TON belong to Telegram?The Open Network (TON) was initially developed by Telegram, but a subsequent legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission saw the messaging application abandon its development efforts in May 2020.The blockchain was originally designed to integrate with Telegram, but its initial attempt was foiled by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Telegram was able to reunite with TON after the network was relaunched by independent developers, making it the only major messaging platform to incorporate Web3.In a post dubbed “What Was TON And Why It Is Over,” the Telegram CEO said that they made the decision in response to a U.S. court prohibiting Telegram from distributing its Gram tokens anywhere in the world. Durov wrote:“The US court declared that Grams couldn't be distributed not only in the United States, but globally. Why? Because, it said, a US citizen might find some way of accessing the TON platform after it launched,” Durov complained.Durov decided to part ways with TON, which became an independent community of validators, launched the TON blockchain independently from Telegram on May 7.However, Telegram endorsed TON in September last year, saying the blockchain and the associated token would be its "official Web3 infrastructure.""To limit Telegram’s share of TON at ≈10% of the supply, we’ll be selling the upcoming surplus of our TON holdings to long-term investors — under 1-4 years lockup and vesting plan, but at a discount to the market price. This way free-floating TON will get locked up, stabilizing the ecosystem and reducing volatility," he statedNew Web3 infrastructureIn September 2023, Telegram introduced its long-awaited crypto wallet built on the TON blockchain.The TON Foundation announced that projects operating on the TON blockchain would receive priority access to Telegram's advertising platform, Telegram Ads. While the wallet feature is currently available in settings for existing users, a global rollout is scheduled to commence in November, excluding the United States and select other countries.In February 2024, Telegram revealed a plan to share ad revenue with channel owners and pay rewards using the Toncoin (TON) token. Telegram recently implemented that plan and allowed users to purchase in-platform ads with TON.On March 31, Telegram introduced a reward system that would allow channel owners with substantial subscribers to earn 50% of the revenue from ads shown in their channels in Toncoin (TON), the project’s native cryptocurrency.Durov said that 50% of the revenue Telegram receives from displaying ads and broadcast channels would be shared with channel owners and content creators using TON’s network.To further extend the Web3 infrastructure, Telegram plans to tokenize its stickers and emojis by transforming them into NFTs on the TON blockchain. This announcement was made at the Token2049 event in Dubai, where Durov highlighted the potential of socially relevant NFTs integrated into human culture and communication.Tether joins TelegramIn a big move with potential game-changing repercussions, Tether recently launched its USDT token and Tether Gold (XAUT) on TON, marking a significant expansion to 15 blockchains. The integration with Telegram, boasting over 900 million users, is expected to enable seamless peer-to-peer (P2P) payments within Telegram's user base.By introducing USDT and XAUT on TON, Tether aims to enhance value transfer between users in the TON ecosystem and other blockchain networks, with increased speed and reduced costs. The addition of USD₮ and XAU₮ on TON is expected to enhance liquidity and activity while offering users a financial experience comparable to traditional systems, advancing Tether's mission of open financial infrastructure across blockchain technology.The Open Network claims to “revolutionize” global peer-to-peer payments, allowing Telegram users to send money instantly without needing a blockchain address or downloading a new app.Notably, USDT on TON will be complemented by fully integrated on-ramps supporting most fiat currencies globally. Additionally, integrated global off-ramps will facilitate users’ withdrawal of supported fiat directly to their bank accounts or cards.The TON Foundation has allocated 11 million TON tokens as incentives to drive adoption. Five million TON will be utilized to boost rewards in USDT/TON liquidity pools across TON decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like StonFi and Dedust.Another 5 million TON will be distributed to users who deposit USDT to the Earn campaign of Telegram’s wallet. Furthermore, withdrawals to TON from supporting exchanges such as OKEx, Bybit and KuCoin will be free for all users until the end of June 2024.The TON community lead urged other cryptocurrencies to join:
New investmentFollowing the news of Tether’s involvement in Telegram, Pantera Capital, a multibillion-dollar hedge fund and venture capital firm, announced its investment in the platform.Pantera sees TON as a platform to broaden cryptocurrency adoption, expecting TON's continued growth among Telegram users, highlighting its scalability and cost-effectiveness."We believe TON has the capacity to introduce crypto to the masses because it is used extensively within the Telegram network. Telegram has over 900 million monthly active users on its future-facing, fast, and secure messaging platform that is used for personal and group communications, large-scale community building, content sharing, and more," the company stated. Toncoin priceIn February, Toncoin embarked on a series of initiatives, demonstrating continued positive momentum. The most recent initiative involved distributing 30 million TON for user participation in ecosystem projects.In late March 2024, Toncoin (TON) surged by 31.83% to $3.68, hitting a two-year high, driven by anticipation of Telegram's upcoming IPO. Trading volumes for TON spiked by 301.96%, reaching $269 million.Source: CoinMarketCapThe integration of the TON wallet into Telegram led to a nearly 7% surge in the price of Toncoin upon the announcement. Following the disclosure of the partnership with Tether, the Toncoin price reached $8.02.

Bitcoin will 'propel the next leg up' if key trading pattern confirms - Traders

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price could see a bullish trend reversal and “propel the next leg up” if the popular trading indicator known as the inverse head and shoulders pattern is confirmed, according to a crypto trader."If we don't break straight through $67.5k then something like this forming over the next month would make sense for a bottom pattern reversal,” crypto trader Matthew Hyland explained in a May 4 post on X.He is referring to the inverse head and shoulders pattern — a bullish indicator which signals the downtrend is easing, and buyers are becoming more dominant in the market.“It would be a great setup to propel the next leg up,” he declares.Although it is crucial that Bitcoin holds above its short-term holder price of $59,500 to "maintain its bullish trend," pseudonymous crypto analyst and co-founder of CMCC Crest Willy Woo told his 1.1 million X followers on May 3.If the inverse head and shoulders pattern forms, Bitcoin's price could dip to $60,000 support levels before hitting new all-time highs. Source: Matthew HylandThe setup appears when Bitcoin’s price forms three troughs below a so-called neckline resistance, with the middle trough — otherwise known as the head  — deeper than the left and right shoulder. Bitcoin’s price has slightly rebounded from the “head" at $58,614 on May 1, and if the pattern continues as Hyland’s model suggests, it will find support around its second shoulder, at $60,000 — a key support level.The decline would represent a 5% from its current price of $63,350, as per CoinMarketCap data. Dropping to this level would liquidate $530 million in long positions, according to CoinGlass data.Bitcoin is currently trading at $63,340. Source: CoinMarketCapAccording to Hyland's model, Bitcoin may rise above the neckline and exceed its current all-time high of $73,800 by June.On top of this, buyer interest in the crypto market is slowly increasing, according to the Fear and Greed Index.The index is currently sitting on a "Greed" score of 69, a major recovery from three days ago when it indicated "Fear" with a score of 43.Related: Bitcoin opens $63K futures gap as thin liquidity threatens BTC priceMeanwhile, some traders expect Bitcoin's price to remain stagnant in the near term, but they don't necessarily view this as negative.“The longer the Bitcoin consolidation takes, the higher its price will meet the trendline,” added pseudonymous crypto trader Titan of Crypto.“Bitcoin’s previous cycle all-time highs tend to slow down price and make Bitcoin stall for some weeks,” pseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Traders told his X followers in a May 4 post.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Bitcoin's bull cycle - Don't be 'fooled' by BTC price's 'April Turmoil' because... - AMBCrypto



Experts like Tom Lee believe Bitcoin will climb higher
Metrics suggested the market hasn’t bottomed yet in light of the persistent sell-side pressure

The last few weeks have been very critical for Bitcoin [BTC], with its price dropping below the critical $60,000-level too. However, following significant corrections, the coin recovered on the charts to trade at $63,167 at the time of writing.
BTC’s 6% hike over a period of just 24 hours points to a potential reversal in the cryptocurrency’s market trajectory. Needless to say, this has renewed a sense of optimism among investors and observers alike.
Is there a buying opportunity amidst volatility?
As volatile as Bitcoin may be right now, however, many execs believe this is an opportunity too. Specially, some see this as a good buying opportunity. Foremost among them is Tom Lee, with Fundstrat’s co-founder claiming during an interview, 
“I think that we’re kind of being fooled by the April turmoil and I think that’s why it’s a buying opportunity for both Bitcoin and stocks now.”
He added, 
“It doesn’t mean it’s going to turn around today but, I don’t think this is a top.” 
According to the exec, the most recent decline was a healthy correction, one possibly driven by profit-taking.
That’s not all, however, with another analyst – @el_crypto_prof – taking to X (Formerly Twitter) to draw a parallel with a historical market trend. 
“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. $BTC has touched a trend line that has played an important role since the beginning of 2023. 
Shedding light on Bitcoin’s future outlook he added, 
“The thing will be sent higher. It’s only a matter of time, imo.” 
Source: El_crypto_prof/Twitter
Crypto-analyst TechDev chipped in too, with the analyst stating,  
“The impulsive structure of the last 1.5 years says 90-100K is next. $BTC”
Source: TechDev/Twitter
Simply put, the general consensus among most analysts is that these market conditions are not the end of the bullish cycle. Rather, they are simply a temporary setback.  
What are the metrics hinting at? 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of BTC’s Age Consumed data echoed its previous findings. Since 3 April, there has been minimal activity, suggesting no indication of a price bottom.
Additionally, Bitcoin’s Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) data, which measures the difference between the last moved price and the current market price, also failed to show signs of a price bottom.
Source: Santiment
Ergo, both metrics contradict the sentiments shared by Lee and others, suggesting that the market may not have reached its bottom yet. 
Echoing the same, an analysis by Glassnode highlighted an uptick in Bitcoin outflows in April – A sign of selling pressure in the market.

Why Regulators Should Embrace DeFi - The Daily Hodl


								
 
Stress tests of major banks have repeatedly failed to uncover serious issues that have led to billions of dollars in losses – DeFi (decentralized finance) changes all of this.
Right now, the world’s financial system operates under a veil of secrecy.
Global banks currently undergo stress tests to examine whether they can withstand significant and sudden market downturns.
But in some cases, regulators only require these exercises to take place once every two years – and the outcomes can be unacceptably opaque.
It is only 16 years since Lehman Brothers spectacularly filed for bankruptcy in what was the world’s biggest commercial collapse ever.
Millions of high-risk mortgages had led to an unstable financial system, as well as a deep and punishing recession when the bubble burst.
Some lessons were learned back then. Scrutiny of major banks increased, and more aggressive affordability checks for home loans were imposed.
Yet despite tighter laws, closer oversight and more stringent stress tests, history keeps on repeating itself.
Just last year, yet another crisis unfolded – with the Bank for International Settlements describing it as “the most significant system-wide banking stress” since 2008.
Silicon Valley Bank, Signature and First Republic all suffered high-profile failures, while Credit Suisse endured a humiliating bailout and takeover by rival UBS.
In the space of 11 days, four banks with an astounding $900 billion in assets were shut down – creating a contagion effect and a crisis of confidence among consumers.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes exposed inadequate risk management procedures within these corporations, with losses on government bonds leading to large deposit outflows that dealt a fatal blow to their liquidity.
The fact that all of this could unfold so quickly painfully exposes the flaws that exist within stress tests.
Regulators are only getting a mere glimpse into the financial health of banks that billions of people rely on every day – and when things go wrong, they’re left playing catch up.
To make matters worse, inadequate levels of transparency are coinciding with an increasingly uncertain economic picture.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has once again admitted that inflation in the US is taking longer than expected to cool – and interest rate cuts may not come as soon as hoped.
The heightened cost of borrowing is causing mortgage defaults to tick upwards.
Widespread issues in China’s property market have also cast a dark shadow over the world’s second-largest economy, with effects that could be felt elsewhere.
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has warned ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East could jeopardize growth prospects in the coming years.
Put it all together, and one thing becomes clear.
It’s never been more important for regular, in-depth stress tests to expose potential vulnerabilities in the financial system – but current methods are falling well short of what’s required.
DeFi offers a compelling alternative and should be embraced by regulators as a matter of urgency.
Lifting the veil of secrecy
When compared with the smoke and mirrors in the world of CeFi (centralized finance) – which means sizable risks to the health of an economy are only detected when it’s too late – DeFi delivers full transparency and in real-time.
DeFi protocols are self-contained ecosystems governed by smart contracts visible to all.
They’re powered by lines of code that dictate the rules for transactions, eliminating the prospect of human error and greed.
An open-source environment means anyone can access and scrutinize these smart contracts, allowing potential issues to be identified and acted upon quickly.
This is in the interests of all parties concerned – the regulators vying to achieve stability, the businesses that wish to avoid costly and reputation-damaging incidents and the consumers who want cast-iron assurances that their savings are safe.
So, what does this mean in practice? Well, it ensures that protocols can be continuously monitored.
Through online simulations, experts can examine how a platform’s liquidity and health are impacted by a multitude of factors – including changes to interest rates, mass withdrawals or a sudden decline in asset prices.
This delivers instant feedback on potential weak spots, meaning preventative safeguards can be put in place.
Never before have regulators been able to access such a vast wealth of data so quickly – and ascertain the financial fragility or resilience of an entire ecosystem with every passing transaction.
Fostering innovation and competition
All of this goes beyond helping regulators uphold high standards. DeFi also ushers in a new financial era – one of inclusion.
Anyone can participate and innovate in the many protocols that now exist today and see where their entrepreneurial spirit takes them.
Whereas old-fashioned firms have proprietary algorithms and complex structures that create barriers to entry, open protocols foster competition and prevent powerful incumbents from forming.
This already has real-world consequences – with banks quick to hike the cost of borrowing when interest rates rise but slow to reward savers.
In Australia, banks have been accused of ‘profit push’ pricing because there are few rivals in the market.
Over in Belgium, regulators have compared the financial sector to an ‘oligopoly,’ where competition is suppressed by major banks.
And in a recent poll, two-thirds of Irish adults said they believe that there’s a lack of competition within the banking industry, and it’s difficult to switch to other providers.
It’s time for change.
By embracing DeFi’s transparency and open architecture, regulators can gain a more holistic view of the financial landscape.
Real-time monitoring, coupled with a decentralized structure, offers the potential for a more resilient and inclusive financial system.
DeFi’s promise of interoperability – where different protocols seamlessly interact – further fosters innovation and paves the way for a vibrant ecosystem.
The time for opaque financial institutions and inadequate stress tests is over.
DeFi presents an opportunity for a more transparent, secure and dynamic financial future – and many existing protocols are keen to cooperate with regulators.
PwC recently said, “There is no investment without trust” – and achieving compliance can actually add value to a project, as well as encourage adoption.
The potential of DeFi to revolutionize financial systems is undeniable. Its core principle – radical transparency – offers a powerful tool to prevent future financial crises.
By openly recording all transactions on a public ledger, DeFi eliminates the opaque practices that fueled past meltdowns.
Regulators, instead of fearing disruption, should recognize DeFi’s potential as an early warning system, enabling them to identify and address risks before they snowball.

Uniswap founder talks about 8 ethical factors regarding token launch | Cryptopolitan

Ethical issues related to token launches have continued. There have been various tokens that were launched on a speculative basis and have brought nothing but losses to investors. Uniswap founder Hayden Adams has opened up about ethical issues related to the token launch and talked about the different aspects of this matter. Token launch and related issuesThe token launch has been one of the critical issues in the blockchain ecosystem. If the developers are clear and fair about the token, it can gain traction in a matter of less time. But if they deceive the investors through fake claims, it can result in a loss of trust in crypto. It has happened multiple times, affecting the trust of customers in the market. Hayden Adams is one of those leaders in the market who continue to ask for fair play in order to improve trust in the crypto market. He has been active in the market since the launch of Uniswap as its founder. He developed Uniswap as a decentralized app on Ethereum, making it one of the most used in the dApp world.  Uniswap is a decentralized crypto exchange that has a set of smart contracts that can be used for crypto trades. In contrast to centralized exchanges, it has certain smart contracts that facilitate crypto trades. Those who invest their crypto assets in this exchange and agree to not trade or sell them can earn UNI tokens. Hayden built one of the most robust protocols for cryptocurrency exchange and developed its token into a valuable one. Now, he has opened up about being heedful to certain issues related to token launches that can affect trust in the crypto market.  Hayden Adams’ (Uniswap founder) take on token launchUniswap founder Hayden Adams has been clear about the token launch. He shared his own perspective regarding them in a detailed Tweet where he covered eight different ethical issues regarding the launch of tokens. He clarified it in the tweet that it wasn’t aimed at any specific project or a developer but rather advice for all. He added that he had seen a growing discourse regarding this issue so he wanted to add his view to it. The first thing he talked about is that the developers should focus on tokens not points. He took a negative view of teasing the investors by creating ambiguity regarding the token distribution. Many developers don’t share the details and keep them delaying in order to grow numbers. He also said that there should be no speculation about a token if there is no clarity about it. He said that if the team doesn’t know what comes next for the token, they shouldn’t be speculating publicly about its value. The Uniswap founder believes in sharing details when ready and has the same advice for developers. Furthermore, he said that he didn’t like float tokens which are malicious. He added further, that developers don’t need exchanges and market makers for effective distribution of tokens. He also said that the developers shouldn’t make an absurdly high token supply which creates unit bias. He also advised against stinginess which will create problems. Further insights regarding tokensHe added that the token price shouldn’t be marketed. If influencers and celebrities are involved in the marketing of tokens, then it means that the developers aren’t building real value. He advised against it and said that they should focus on building real value for tokens. In his final advice, he said that market leaders should be careful about their decisions. He said that decisions shouldn’t be haphazard, making them laughing stock for crypto Twitter. ConclusionUniswap founder Hayden Adams talked about the problems related to token launch in a Tweet. He covered a range of issues in eight points. The narrative talked about building value instead of fanfare so that tokens launches don’t make market leaders a laughing stock.

WIF can flip PEPE in the memecoin race, but ONLY if... - AMBCrypto



WIF recorded a massive surge in market cap over the last few days, while also inching closer to PEPE
Social volume and sentiment around WIF fell, despite the hike in price

Dogwifhat [WIF] has been one of the market’s most popular memecoins over the last few months. While once the memecoin saw its fair share of ups and downs, it would seem that the altcoin is now well on its way to break into the memecoin sector’s top-3
A WIF of success
Over the last few days, the marketcap of WIF has surged significantly. Owing to the same, WIF is now exceedingly close to overtaking PEPE’s marketcap and rank.
Source: CoinMarketCap
However, for WIF to surpass PEPE and claim the number 3 position, the price of WIF would need to climb significantly higher. Also, while WIF did climb by a significant 25% in just 24 hours, it wasn’t able to reverse its prevailing market trend. In fact, until the most recent bout of price appreciation, the memecoin was on its way down, hitting multiple lower lows and lower highs on the charts.
For WIF to break past this bearish trend and possibly push itself to the $4.382-level, it would have to test and move past the $3.594-level.
Worth noting, however, that the CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) for WIF was on its side and had risen significantly – A sign of rising money flow and buying pressure.
However, the RSI had a reading of 74.86, indicating that the price may be in the overbought zone despite all the bullish momentum. Ergo, WIF may see a correction in the next few days before rising higher again.
Source: Trading View
Looking at the socials
A huge majority of WIF’s price surge can be attributed to the social volume around the WIF token. However, over the last few days, the social volume around WIF declined, which may cause massive problems for WIF’s price in the future.
Additionally, the weighted sentiment around WIF fell too, suggesting that the number of negative comments around WIF grew.

On the flipside, social volume around PEPE continued to remain consistent, while its weighted sentiment grew. The positive outlook around PEPE on social media platforms may give PEPE the right amount of edge needed to retain its number 3 position in the memecoin sector. Especially since alongside WIF, PEPE also hiked by double-digits on the charts.

New Lawsuit Filed Against Coinbase: Affecting Solana and 7 Other Altcoins - Bitcoin Sistemi

Coinbase, the leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume in the United States, is once again under the legal spotlight. A new class-action lawsuit has been filed against the company, claiming that its entire business model has been unlawful from its inception. This case mirrors a similar lawsuit the company is currently facing.
Plaintiffs in the new lawsuit claim that the ALGO, XLM, SOL, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, UNI and XTZ tokens traded on Coinbase are, in fact, securities. The lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California by west coast law firm Scott+Scott, which represents plaintiffs from California and Florida.


The lawsuit alleges that Coinbase has “knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly violated state securities laws since it began doing business.” In response to these allegations, Coinbase issued a statement denying the allegations as “legally unfounded,” expressing full faith in due process, and stating their intent to fully address the allegations at the appropriate time.

Interestingly, this case bears a striking resemblance to another case currently pending in the courts. This other lawsuit also alleges consumer damages resulting from the sale of securities on Coinbase's platform. The case, which was initially dismissed in February 2023, was partially revived following a recent decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.





This latest case differs from Coinbase's highly publicized legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on a similar issue, namely whether tokens sold on Coinbase are securities. In this ongoing case, Coinbase recently filed a temporary appeal challenging a judge's decision to allow the case to proceed.

                        Today’s Ripple price prediction is closely watched as XRP trades at $0.5283 with a 24-hour trading volume of $675 million. Despite a slight decline of 0.40%, Ripple maintains its position as the seventh-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap, with a market capitalization of approximately $29.18 billion. The currency has a circulating supply of 55.24 billion XRP coins out of a maximum supply of 100 billion, highlighting its significant stake in the cryptocurrency market.860,000 Investors Flock to XRP Despite Price Drop
Over the past month, the number of XRP investors holding between 1,000 and 1,000,000 tokens has increased to 860,000, a rise of 0.23%, according to data from Santiment. This uptick in holders comes in spite of a decrease in XRP’s market value.Notably, this group of investors, often referred to as “whales,” experienced a decline early in the year, with numbers dropping from 867,000 to a low of 858,000 by April 3. However, the count rebounded shortly thereafter.This slight yet significant growth in investor numbers is remarkable given the broader context of a 7% loss in XRP’s value recently. Such an increase in whale activity typically suggests a potential price rally could be on the horizon.Despite the prevailing bearish market conditions, the resilience of the demand for XRP highlights its ongoing appeal among substantial stakeholders.
XRP whale count hints at a possible price rally.
Despite a 7% drop in value, investor interest in XRP remains high.
Key momentum indicators like the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) show positive signs despite the price decline.
Ripple Price Prediction
The four-hour chart demonstrates that XRP/USD is currently teetering near its pivot point of $0.5180. Should XRP manage to sustain its position above this level, the outlook could remain bullish.Conversely, a drop below this threshold may precipitate a sharp downward trend. This pivot point acts as a critical juncture for determining XRP’s short-term price movements.On the technical front, key resistance levels are established at $0.5555, $0.5957, and $0.6280, which Ripple would need to breach to confirm further bullish momentum. Support levels are identified at $0.4877, $0.4586, and $0.4361, which will provide cushions if the price falls.The presence of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the chart suggests that XRP is consolidating within these bounds. Depending on market forces and trader sentiment, a breakout or breakdown may occur.Ripple Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 54, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned at $0.5207, closely aligning with the current pivot and reinforcing its role as a significant support level.Conclusion: Ripple’s performance is currently balanced with a cautious outlook; remaining above $0.5180 could foster a bullish scenario while dropping this pivot below might lead to significant selling pressure.Dogeverse Raised Over $13 Million; Secure Now

Paolo Ardoino (Bitfinex CTO) has denied rumors of data breach | Cryptopolitan

There have been claims about a hacker group breaching the personal data of users from Bitfinex. The company has denied any such claims saying that the customer data is safe. They are carrying out investigations to ensure that no such event has taken place. Claims regarding rumors of Bitfinex data breachBitfinex is a cryptocurrency exchange that is registered in the British Virgin Islands. It was founded in 2012 and has continued to be one of the biggest names of trust in the crypto market. Initially, it was designed to be a Bitcoin P2P exchange but was later modified to accommodate other cryptocurrencies.It faced a big data heist in 2016 when BTC worth more than $71 million was heisted in a matter of hours. This breach is considered one of the biggest heists in crypto history. Serious flaws in the Bitfinex security protocol were pointed out which were later remedied. Though the thief hasn’t been found, there have been individual developments where the stolen Bitcoins were recovered. iFinex, the owner company of Bitfinex, commissioned a report to find out the reasons for the heist. The commission found a number of reasons for this happening. There was a recommendation for some operational, financial, and technological controls to ensure that no such event takes place again.Since then, Bitfinex has continued to be safe for users as no such event has been reported again. But recently some hackers posted mega links about the data breach of Bitfinex. According to hackers, it contained the personal data of the users.  Paolo Ardoino’s response Bifinex’s CTO responded to the claims regarding the data breach saying that it was nothing but rumors. He said that everyone was panicking about the possibility of the data breach but it seemed fake for a number of reasons. He mentioned that the hackers have posted mega links that contain a sample of passwords and emails. He refuted the claim that they don’t store passwords in plaintext. In addition to that, nor are 2FA stored in clear text. Furthermore, the 22.5 emails contain only 5K of the Bitfinex users. He added further that if the emails were from their database, they would have matched 100%. In contrast, it is the opposite and makes sure that no data breach has taken place. Also, the hackers had posted about the data breach on 25 April 2024 but no one contacted the Bitfinex team regarding ransom. Paolo is of the view that if they had data they would have asked for ransom in the possible options available.He also chided data security experts for hyping the matter without getting enough information. He said that these emails are possibly from different crypto breaches that the hackers have collected to get hype for their claims. No need to panicPaolo Ardoino added consoling words for the customers saying that they don’t need to panic and no such breach has taken place. He said that they had analyzed their system and no such evidence regarding the breach was found. Furthermore, they were performing a deep analysis which will confirm whether any data has been lost to hackers. He assured the users that it was a FUD and they would ensure that no stone remained unturned to ensure the security of the platform. ConclusionBitfinex CTO has refuted the claims of a possible data breach. He assured the users that no such event had taken place and there was no proof regarding the data breach. His arguments were solid and he assured that they will continue investigations about the matter.

Horoscope crypto from May 6th to May 12th

New week, new crypto horoscope dedicated to the upcoming week from May 6th to May 12th.
This week will be characterized by the transit of the New Moon in Taurus on Wednesday 8/5.
For several months now we have been dedicating space to the crypto horoscope written by Stefania Stimolo, an expert in astrology and blockchain. It is a weekly column with the horoscope of each zodiac sign available every Sunday only on The Cryptonomist. 
In our slogan “Telling the Future”, we wanted to delve deeper into the topic, jokingly speaking, with this entertainment column. 

The crypto horoscope
We call it crypto horoscope simply because industry terminology is used. 
Words like NFT, metaverse, and Over-The-Counter to describe actions and scenarios, but also trading terminology like bullish, bull run, bear market, or dump to identify the mood of each zodiac sign during the days of the week.
Obviously, the famous to-the-moon cannot be missing to indicate the mood of that sign! 
In general, you could experience a period of “hard-fork”, intended as an “inner split”, or pass your lightning torch to the next zodiac sign, meaning that the Sun is moving into the next sign. 
Or, simply, you need to reflect on some situations that go into “verify“, that is when the planet is in dissonance with the zodiac sign. Moreover, with each new change of guard of the Sun through the constellations of the zodiac, the roadmap of each sign will touch a new step. 
Obviously no investment advice is given, in fact, it is pure entertainment, just like any other horoscope. It must be said that there are many beginners in the sector who have understood the specific crypto terminology also thanks to the horoscope on The Cryptonomist. 
“Don’t Trust, Verify”
Astrology is not an exact science, but it aims to predict the future in its own way. So why not associate the typical phrase of blockchain “Don’t Trust, Verify” here as well. 
And in fact, what the author wants to propose is her interpretation of the planetary transits that occur during the week, describing the reaction of each zodiac sign, following the “logic” of traditional astrology. 
For those who are astrology lovers, they could stay updated just on the transits that are communicated weekly and somehow influence us. A Mercury Retrograde, or the days of the Full Moon. 
Others, on the other hand, could access the dedicated page, which is updated every Sunday, and read the horoscope of their zodiac sign, their rising sign, or why not, even the horoscope of friends and loved ones. 
And so, just for entertainment purposes, don’t waste time and click here to read your horoscope for this week!

Bitfinex database breach 'seems fake,' says CTO

The claims by hacking group FSOCIETY that they hacked cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex's database and leaked 22,500 customer emails and passwords “seems fake,” according to Bitfinex chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino.“If they had any real information they would have asked a ramson through our bug bounty, customer support ticket, emails, Twitter, etc. We couldn't find any request,” Ardoino claimed in a May 4 post on X.“We don't store plaintext passwords, nor 2FA secrets in clear text,” he added.Adoino clarified that out of the 22,500 records of emails and passwords, only 5,000 matched with Bitfinex users. He suggested that it is more likely the hackers gathered data from various other crypto data breaches.“Most users unfortunately use the same email and passwords across multiple sites,” he explained.He also shared a message from a security researcher, who believes the hackers were claiming to have hacked Bitfinex as a way to promote a data retrieval hacking tool.“So by creating a buzz about successfully hacking wellknown companies / a university, it is an advertisement of how good their tool is and others should buy it so they can make millions of dollars by using it to exploit companies using this tool.”Ardoino assured users that they would keep investigating the situation, but no breach has been detected so far, and all "funds are safe."Related: Bitcoin post-halving price consolidation could last 2 months — BitfinexThis is not the first time Bitfinex has faced scrutiny over data breach concerns.In November 2023, Cointelegraph reported a minor information security incident at Bitfinex when one of its customer support agents was hacked.This resulted in a series of phishing attacks targeting Bitfinex users, though Bitfinex stated that little harm occurred.Meanwhile, in 2016, Bitfinex suffered a security breach resulting in the loss of 119,576 customers' Bitcoin (BTC), worth around $70 million at the time, and $7.6 billion now.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

PEPE 7-day price prediction - 3 key factors will help the memecoin - AMBCrypto



Rising active addresses propelled the significant price increase.
Circulation fell, and many old coins remained stagnant, indicating another upside.

The price of Pepe [PEPE] increased by 15.75% in the last 24 hours before falling 2%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
Though other memecoins also jumped, AMBCrypto found specific reasons why the hike was special for PEPE.
Price is tied up with activity
According to on-chain data from Santiment, PEPE’s 24-hour active addresses increased from 2669 on the 1st of May to 4470 at press time.
Active addresses show the number of distinct users transacting on the network. In the broader crypto market, this metric does not always correlate with price.
However, a look at PEPE’s situation showed the price has a strong correlation with network activity.
Source: Santiment
Should the metric continue to rise, the price of PEPE might also follow. On the contrary, a decline in active addresses might slow down the memecoin’s upward movement.
As a result of the price increase, Social Dominance jumped. Social Dominance shows the rate of discussions about a project when compared to others in the top 100.
Therefore, the increase implied that the market gave the memecoin the attention that others did not get. However, an extremely high social dominance might not be great for price as shown in the chart below.
A rise to $0.00001 may be next
For instance, when Social Dominance hit 2.21% on the 4th of March, the token reversed from its upswing.  A similar situation occurred on the 1st of April, as the metric indicated that PEPE was overhead.
Furthermore, Social Dominance was at a relatively healthy level. As such, the price of the token might hit $0.00001 before any retracement appears.
As for Social Volume, AMBCrypto noticed that it was not near previous peaks, indicating that the search for PEPE was not intense.
Following historical data, this means that there might be a buying opportunity available before it reaches the local top.
Source: Santiment
In the meantime, the one-day circulation fell from 11.50 trillion to 3.97 trillion. Regarding its price, the decline in circulation might help PEPE sustain the northward move.
This is because less circulation gives room for less selling pressure. However, this would only be the case if the buying momentum increases.
Another metric we evaluated was the dormant circulation. At press time, the 90-day dormant circulation decreased to 59.54 billion.
Source: Santiment

Realistic or not, here’s PEPE’s market cap in DOGE terms

This decrease meant that old holders of the token refrained from moving their assets. Hence, most are unwilling to sell. Should this be the case going forward, another PEPE rally could be close.
This time, the token could drive toward a new high.

XRP Plunges Ahead Of The SEC’s Upcoming Reply Brief On May 6 - Coin Edition


							

XRP pulled back on Saturday as users anticipate the SEC’s reply brief on May 6.
The brief will follow up on the ongoing case between the SEC and Ripple.
The brief’s content will inform users of the strength of the SEC’s case against Ripple.




XRP made a slight pullback on Saturday as users look forward to the upcoming reply brief by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its case against Ripple. The court expects the commission to file a remedy-related reply brief on Monday, May 6, to argue why Ripple should be penalized.



The expected reply brief will be one in a series of filings between the SEC and Ripple, which started with the SEC’s opening brief in March. The commission had pressed for a punitive penalty and an injunction against Ripple, alleging that the latter breached U.S. Securities laws after the December 2020 complaint.



Following the SEC’s remedy-related opening brief, Ripple filed a remedy-related opposition brief to counter the SEC’s allegations. In its opposition brief filing, the fintech firm asked the court to strike the SEC’s filing, citing irregularities and lateness in the brief filing. Ripple also noted that it made the post-complain XRP sales to accredited investors through ODL agreements. Hence, it did not constitute an infraction.



Meanwhile, crypto investors, especially members of the Ripple community, look forward to the SEC’s upcoming reply brief on May 6. It will provide information on the strength of the SEC’s case for a punitive penalty and injunction on Ripple. XRP could come under selling pressure peradventure the SEC provides substantive for its claim that XRP breached the law after the December 2020 complaint.



An injunction prohibiting Ripple from selling XRP to institutional investors would significantly affect Ripple’s plans for the U.S. market. It will also impact investors’ sentiment and induce a selling pressure on the altcoin.



XRP traded for $0.52661 at the time of writing, reflecting a 2.78% drop from its Saturday high, according to data from TradingView.

Bitcoin Maintains $63K, Dogecoin's Rise Continues With Another 6% Surge (Weekend Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price recovery tour took it to a multi-day peak of $64,500 yesterday, but the asset failed to continue upward and has retraced by over a grand since then.
Most larger-cal alts are slightly in the red on a daily scale, with TON, ADA, and SHIB declining by 2-4%.
BTC Stopped at $64.5K
The start of May was quite painful for the bitcoin bulls as the cryptocurrency slumped hard after failing to pump above $65,000 a day earlier. The massive correction drove the asset to its lowest price tag in over two months of $56,500.
The Fed’s refusal to raise the interest rates any further brought more volatility, as BTC pumped and dumped by $2,000 in minutes on Wednesday afternoon. Only then started the gradual price recovery as bitcoin jumped to $59,000 by Friday.
The bulls initiated another leg up then that drove the asset to and beyond $62,000. This increase culminated yesterday with an increase to a multi-day high of $64,500.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


However, bitcoin failed to overcome that level and has retraced by more than $1,000 since then. Still, it trades above $63,000 and its dominance over the alts has neared 51%. In contrast, its market cap has declined to $1.244 trillion on CG.

DOGE Keeps Rising
The largest meme coin – Dogecoin – was among the top performers yesterday and it has only doubled down on its run. DOGE has jumped by another 6% in the past 24 hours and now trades at $0.16.
The other impressive gainer from the top 36 alts is RNDR, which has soared to $9 after an 8.5% daily increase. AVAX, LINK, and NEAR are also in the green.
In contrast, TON, SHIB, and ADA have declined by somewhere between 2-4%. ETH, BNB, SOL, and XRP are also in the red but in a less painful fashion.
The total crypto market cap has declined by around $40 billion since yesterday’s peak and is now down to $2.450 trillion on CG.

Bitfinex CTO Dispels FUD, Refutes Data Breach By Ransomware Group | Bitcoinist.com


								In an interesting turn of events, Bitfinex chief technology officer (CTO) Paolo Ardoino has dismissed rumors of the exchange being involved in a large-scale data breach. This came in response to claims of a significant security breach by the hacking group FSOCIETY a little over a week ago.
On April 26, FSOCIETY claimed on its dark web homepage that it had successfully breached the security measures and obtained sensitive data of several entities, including Bitfinex. Other organizations the group contacted include Rutgers University, SBCGlobal, and Coinmoma (likely a wrong spelling of the Coinmama crypto exchange).
FSOCIETY, in its messages to the supposed victims, gave an ultimatum of seven days for each organization to make a substantial payment to avoid the leak of sensitive data. Despite the one-week deadline elapsing, none of these establishments have confirmed a server breach or the payment of a ransom.
Bitfinex CTO Responds To Data Breach Rumors
On Saturday, May 4th, Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino took to the X platform to share a message on a purported breach of the exchange’s servers and security. According to the CTO, the ransomware group never directly contacted the exchange about any data breach, as they only got to find out about the claim on Friday, May 3rd.



Ardoino, who is also the CEO of Tether, mentioned that only 5,000 of the supposedly stolen 22,500 emails match that of Bitfinex customers. The exchange executive claims that hackers merely collected a database of emails/passwords from various crypto hacks.
Ardoino added in his post:
Most of users unfortunately use same email/passwords across multiple sites. We’re performing deep analysis of our systems and no breach was found currently. Also the KYC platform has heavy rate limiting that would disallow downloading in bulk.
While labeling the data breach rumors as pure FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), the Bitfinex CTO reiterated that they will keep evaluating the situation to ensure that “no stone remains unturned.” Ardoino also assured the exchange users that all funds are safe.
Data Breach Claim Was A Marketing Strategy: Security Researcher
In a follow-up post on X, Paolo Ardoino revealed a message from an independent security researcher on the purported data breach incident. According to the unnamed investigator, the FSOCIETY’s claim of the data breach was a ruse to market their ransomware products.

Source: Paolo Ardoino/X
The researcher’s message read:
I believe I start to understand what is happening and why they are sending these messages claiming you were hacked. The message in the screenshot in the ticket came from a TG channel (not reporting here to avoid helping them with free advertisement). There it seems they are selling the tool used that supposedly was used to hack Bitfinex and Rutgers.

With this revelation, Ardoino questioned the credibility of their claims of hacking different organizations. “If they truly hacked Bitfinex, do they really need selling stuff for 299$?,” the CTO said.

Uniswap Founder Shares His Two Cents On Good Token Distributions


                            Hayden Adams, founder of the Uniswap protocol, has shared his opinion on what characterizes a good distribution or rollout of a token. In a recent post on the X platform, the prominent crypto figure listed 10 qualities of good token distributions, highlighting the complexities surrounding the launch of a cryptocurrency.
Uniswap Founder Gives Opinion On Good Token Distributions
Adams began his take on good token distributions by stating that projects should allocate “tokens, not points” to the community. This phrase implies that participants should receive actual tokens that hold value within a particular ecosystem or on a network, instead of receiving points that may have limited utility.


Secondly, Adams warned against creating ambiguity or being vague about a token distribution to increase the number of participants or to “farm the farmers.” A good token distribution practice includes sharing real details when ready, according to the Uniswap founder.

Additionally, Adams criticized “low float tokens,” while calling them malicious. The prominent DeFi figure urged project teams to ensure sufficient tokens are available in circulation to prevent manipulation and allow genuine price discovery.
Adams also discouraged hyping a token’s price and how it will skyrocket before it launches. The founder believes hiring an influencer or a marketing company to promote a token’s value only depicts a get-rich-quick scheme rather than a genuine attempt at building real value.
What’s more, the Uniswap founder stressed the importance of free token airdrops during token distributions. “Don’t be stingy – give a significant amount away. If you don’t think the community deserves a significant amount, don’t release a token,” Adams said in his post.
Ultimately, Adams advised new crypto projects to be careful and thoughtful in their decision-making to avoid making mistakes that might put them at odds with the crypto community. “Create something you’re proud of and stand behind it,” the Uniswap founder added.
A Jab At Friend.tech and its FRIEND?
At the beginning of his post, the Uniswap founder clearly stated that the opinion is not aimed at any specific project. However, the timing is interesting, especially after social media platform Friend.tech’s “unsuccessful” token airdrop.

On Friday, May 3rd, Friend.tech airdropped its new FRIEND tokens to users in conjunction with the launch of the protocol’s version 2. While the token’s value quickly rose to $167 after launch, FRIEND’s price nosedived to below $2 within a few hours.
Analysts pinpointed liquidity issues and a mass sell-off as the primary reasons behind the downturn of FRIEND and, ultimately, the ineffectual token launch. Moreover, many users complained about how challenging it was to claim the token airdrop, as technical drawbacks reportedly frustrated the process.

Sui Network clears up misunderstandings on token supply

Sui Network, a layer-1 decentralized platform, has responded to and corrected common misunderstandings about its token supply. This statement, posted on the X platform, refutes criticisms about its tokenomics, specifically addressing concerns about token distribution and founder control. The platform maintains that its token economics are sound, utilizing reputable third-party custodians to manage locked tokens. Tokens are released according to a predetermined emission schedule and are publicly accessible. The foundation emphasizes that founders cannot control the treasury or tokens allocated to investors, including the community reserve.According to feedback from the Sui Network, the Sui Foundation manages the primary wallet holding locked tokens, which are released under specific conditions to enhance the ecosystem. These allocations support various projects, including Move programming language development, network security enhancements, hackathons, and developer grants.Source: Justin BonsSui Network further explained the distribution of staking rewards circulating in the system. These rewards comprise stake derivatives and network commissions, all of which are returned to the community. This approach is a key aspect of Sui’s economic model, which aims to maintain balance and fairness.Despite Sui Network’s clarifications, Justin Bons from Cyber Capital expressed concerns about the founding team’s token holdings. Bons suggested that the founders may control a substantial portion of staked tokens, posing a centralization risk. This prompted calls for greater transparency and accountability from the network’s management, which the Sui team has since addressed.In contrast, Sui Network disputes this assertion as inaccurate regarding token distribution and management, emphasizing their commitment to transparency. They have disclosed that all tokens, whether distributed or not, are managed in compliance with legal and regulatory standards overseen by reputable custodial services like BitGo, Anchorage, and Coinbase Prime.Related: Can blockchain revolutionize digital securities management for stock exchanges?However, Bons challenged the Sui Network’s claim of transparency by urging them to accurately represent the status of the allocated stake and demonstrate that the founders cannot move or access it. Bons emphasized that his critique is motivated by a desire for SUI’s success. He suggested that misrepresenting these tokens’ status undermines transparency claims and that true transparency requires clear evidence that the allocated tokens are securely held and cannot be manipulated. In September 2023, Sui Network streamlined Web3 logins for users on its apps with Zero Knowledge login (zkLogin), enabling login via Google, Facebook, and Twitch details. Known for high transaction capacity with low fees since launch. Since its launch, it has built a reputation for handling high transaction volumes while maintaining low fees.Magazine: Memecoins make millionaires, Terraform and Do Kwon liable for fraud, and more: Hodler’s Digest, March 31 – April 6

Crypto Analyst Unveils Massive Bitcoin Price Target, Says BTC Flashing Bullish Chart Pattern - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist believes that Bitcoin (BTC) can skyrocket over 337% based on a classical chart pattern.
Pseudonymous analyst Cheds tells his 330,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be forming a cup-and-handle pattern on the weekly chart.










Cheds says that based on classical charting rules, Bitcoin could soar close to $300,000 in about two years.
“BTC visual of a bull thesis. Measured move for a weekly cup and handle would be roughly $280,000 BTC, likely sometime in mid-2026.”
Source: Cheds/X
The trader highlights that his price target and timeline go against the two widely held views on Bitcoin’s market cycles. One is that the Bitcoin bull market will likely end in 2025 based on the four-year cycle and the other one involves a theory that BTC is witnessing diminishing returns each cycle.
But in the meantime, Cheds implies that Bitcoin may have already seen the bottom of its latest correction after reclaiming $61,500.
“BTC decent volume cluster building on the four-hour chart… flip $61,500 and it gets interesting.”
Source: Cheds/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Bitcoin looks bullish following a fakeout to the downside. The chart also shows a diagonal resistance at around $63,500.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $63,438, a fractional increase in the past day.

Bitfinex CTO Debunks Data Breach Rumors On The Crypto Exchange - Coin Edition


							

Bitfinex’s CTO has debunked rumors of a suspected data breach on the crypto exchange’s platform.
Ardoino highlighted irregularities contained in the claim by the acclaimed hackers.
According to Ardoino, only 5,000 of 22,500 broadcasted emails matched with Bitfinex users.




Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino has debunked rumors of a suspected data breach on the crypto exchange’s platform. In a recent post on X, Ardoino explained that information broadcasted by the acclaimed hackers is fake, and not derived from the crypto firm’s database.







After acknowledging the widespread panic among crypto users on the rumored database breach, Ardoino highlighted irregularities contained in the claim by the acclaimed hackers. According to the CTO, the alleged hackers have posted two mega links with sample data containing 22,500 records of email and passwords.



To substantiate his claims, Ardoino noted that Bitfinex does not store plaintext passwords nor 2FA secrets in clear text. Hence, no one can access such details from the platform. He further explained that only 5,000 of 22,500 broadcasted emails matched with Bitfinex users, insisting that only a 100% match rate can prove the broadcasted information was from Bitfinex. 



Meanwhile, Ardoino informed his followers on X that the alleged hackers did not contact Bitfinex. According to him, the hackers published the post on April 25, giving the firm a 7-day ultimatum to contact them. Yet, Ardoino noted that he and his team learned about the post on Friday, May 3.



Furthering his claims, Ardoino said the alleged hackers could have explored any available channels to demand a ransom. According to the CTO, they could have applied through Bitfinex’s bug bounty, customer support ticket, emails, or X account (Twitter).



According to Ardoino, initial investigations reveal the hackers collected a database of emails and passwords likely from different crypto breaches. He noted that most crypto users, unfortunately, use the same email and passwords across multiple sites. He assured users that Bitfinex is performing a deep analysis of its systems and hasn’t found any breach. The CTO also noted that his platform’s KYC has a heavy rate limit that would disallow downloading in bulk.

Oil King (OILKING) to Rally 8,300% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Oil King (OILKING) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Oil King (OILKING), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Oil King presents a similar opportunity.



Oil King has market cap below $25,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate massive returns in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,300% in the coming two days, and Oil King could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Oil King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Oil King on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Oil King by entering its contract address – H5LmDBec75DmGLwtALURVAtLuVDUX1GMh5CGQ8r5h5rU – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like OILKING.

Warren Buffett Warns About AI


Legendary investor Warren Buffett has issued a major warning about artificial intelligence, comparing the red-hot technology to nuclear weapons during a recent shareholder meeting, Axios reports.Buffett's concerns center around the rapid proliferation of AI-powered scams. The American financier has stated that the technology "scares the hell out of him."According to the "Oracle of Omaha," AI has developed to the point where it is hardly possible to decipher what's real and what's actually fake.Buffett, one of the richest people, jokingly described scamming as "the growth industry" of all time.At the same time, he has also acknowledged that his knowledge about AI is limited.The billionaire himself has already fallen victim to scammers. Buffett has recalled how someone used the AI technology to create a convincing deepfake video of him in order to part someone with their money.Of course, Buffett is far from being the only businessman whose identity has been exploited by nefarious actors. As reported by U.Today, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also repeatedly complained about AI fraudsters using his identity in order to promote XRP scams.Of course, plenty of prominent executives have also recognized the promise of AI technologies, with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently comparing it to the steam engine.

Coinbase faces new lawsuit over alleged investor deception

Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States by volume and its CEO, Brian Armstrong, is facing a new class-action lawsuit alleging investor deception into buying securities. The lawsuit is from customers who say the company’s business model was illegal. This lawsuit echoes one already faced by the company. The lawsuit, filed in California’s Northern District by law firm Scott+Scott, representing plaintiffs Gerardo Aceves, Thomas Fan, Edwin Martinez, Tiffany Smoot, Edouard Cordi, and Brett Maggard from California and Florida, alleges that Coinbase’s digital asset sales knowingly violated state securities laws since the company’s inception.In the filing, the plaintiffs asserted that Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Near Protocol (NEAR), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Uniswap (UNI), Tezos (XTZ), and Stellar Lumens (XLM) are securities.Class action suit by the plaintiff   Source: Court ListenerThe complainants claim Coinbase admitted it is a “Securities Broker” in its user agreement, making digital asset securities sold by the exchange as investment contracts or other securities. The plaintiff also took aim at Coinbase prime brokerage as a securities broker/dealer.The plaintiffs seek full rescission, statutory damages under state law, and injunctive relief through a jury trial. This lawsuit resembles another class-action suit alleging consumer harm from Coinbase’s sale of securities. However, Coinbase argued that secondary crypto asset sales didn’t meet securities transaction criteria, disputing the relevance of securities regulations. The court examined various aspects, ultimately overturning some of the lower court’s decisions while upholding others.Related: Coinbase's Base could make it the NVIDIA of DeFiThis new lawsuit is distinct from Coinbase’s highly publicized legal battle with the SEC, which also questions whether tokens sold on Coinbase should be classified as securities. Coinbase has recently filed an interlocutory appeal in response to a judge’s decision allowing the case to proceed.In an April 26 filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, John Deaton, the crypto lawyer currently running a Senate campaign to unseat Elizabeth Warren, filed an amicus brief in support of a motion for interlocutory appeal on behalf of 4,701 Coinbase customers. Coinbase reported a strong rebound in the first quarter of 2024, supported by an uptick in market performance and the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The exchange posted $1.6 billion in total revenue and $1.2 billion in net income for the first quarter, achieving $1 billion in Adjusted EBITDA — which measures a company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Six to Twelve Months of ‘Parabolic Advance’ on the Horizon for Bitcoin, According to On-Chain Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								Prominent on-chain analyst Checkmate is updating his outlook on Bitcoin’s (BTC) current market cycle and says that a parabolic move to the upside is likely in sight.
The pseudonymous analyst tells his 90,000 followers on the social media platform X that based on previous cycles, Bitcoin is most likely in for about six months of “chopsolidation” – or a choppy period of consolidation with no real trend shift.










After six months, Checkmate says that six months to a year’s worth of parabolic moves could be in store, based on historical precedence.
“Bitcoin history tends to rhyme, and thus far, this cycle is no different.
The song sung during the last two cycles paints around six-months of chopsolidation ahead of us, followed by 6-12 months of parabolic advance.”
Source: Checkmate/X
While some are speculating that Bitcoin’s bull run may have already seen its top, Checkmate says such a scenario would be a major break from the “norm” of BTC’s past market cycles.
“If we measure from the cycle high, we see the same chorus.
Establishing a bull market top here would no question be a major break from the Bitcoin norm. It could for sure happen, but we must dig deeper to investigate…
April so far has seen prices drop by over $8,250 MoM (month over month)
I’m expecting text messages from the sidelines saying ‘Hey man, what’s up with Bitcoin, it’s down a lot, I hope you sold it?'”
Checkmate isolates every year in which a Bitcoin halving takes place, and notes that corrections like the one BTC has had since March are par for the course. The analyst also notes that the end of halving years tend to be quite bullish for Bitcoin.
“If we isolate Bitcoin halving years only (2012, 2016, 2020, 2024) we can see MoM performance via table and chart.
MoM corrections of this magnitude are the norm, not the exception, and the end of the year is usually pretty powerful (as per first charts).”

US Authorities Are Going After These Crypto Entities


																Over time, the United States government, through its regulatory agencies, has filed cases against several crypto firms, demanding compliance for their products and services.
While the list is extensive, some cases have stood out, like lawsuits against decentralized protocols like Uniswap, crypto mixing platforms like Tornado Cash, and big firms like Binance and Coinbase.
The U.S. Fights Crypto
The U.S. government’s fight against crypto entities became more intense last year. Within 48 hours in early June, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance and Coinbase, the largest crypto exchanges globally and in the country. The allegations against the entities were similar: failure to register as brokers, national securities exchanges, clearing agencies, and violation of U.S. securities laws.
Two months after the Binance and Coinbase lawsuits, the  Department of Justice (DOJ) charged the co-founders of Tornado Cash, accusing them of laundering over $1 billion in criminal proceeds. This was a year after the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the crypto mixer for its ties to cybercrime groups.
Toward the end of last year, the SEC sued the crypto exchange Kraken on the same charges it brought against Binance and Coinbase. Around the same time, the DOJ charged Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), with willfully violating the Bank Secrecy Act. The case saw the crypto exchange pay a fine of $4.3 billion, while CZ resigned from the role of CEO with a $50 million penalty.
The War Against DeFi
In March 2024, the DOJ charged crypto exchange KuCoin and its founders with violating the Bank Secrecy Act and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business.
Last month, the SEC filed a notice of intent to sue Uniswap Labs, the company behind the largest decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap, for reasons yet to be disclosed. Around the same period, blockchain software technology company Consensys received a Wells Notice from the agency signaling intent of enforcement action against the company for violations of securities laws through its MetaMask wallet.
Also, the DOJ arrested and charged the founders of privacy-focused bitcoin wallet Samourai in the same month, accusing them of enabling over $100 million in laundered funds. At the time of writing, the wallet’s services were shut down, and its websites were seized. In addition, the DOJ recently arrested early BTC investor Roger Ver, popularly known as Bitcoin Jesus, for allegedly evading up to $50 million in taxes.
Meanwhile, one remarkable case in the industry is the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which has helped the crypto community clarify crypto asset securities.

Bitcoin could drop further if this support zone is crushed


Bitcoin (BTC) has recently demonstrated a significant recovery, climbing above the $60,000 threshold, a development that follows a tumultuous week where its price dropped below $57,000 prior to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. 
This marked a surprising 8% drawdown, sending Bitcoin to its lowest in two months. However, amid a broader stock market rise and a weaker-than-expected US jobs report, Bitcoin’s price trajectory is looking optimistic.
In this context, RLinda, a prominent crypto analyst and professional trader, emphasized the importance of the key $64,500 level for Bitcoin in her May 5 TradingView post.

A breakout and consolidation above this key resistance could set the stage for further growth, potentially propelling prices towards $73,000. Such a movement would signify a shift in market dynamics from neutral to decidedly bullish.

“The trend is still strong and bullish. The price is in a sideways range and continues to collect liquidity. The range boundaries are 73500 – 60000K. The key level below which there is a huge pool of liquidity is 59300-59500, there is a high probability that Bitcoin can test this area before further growth. I am expecting a rise because Bitcoin’s technical and fundamental components look very promising: Bullish trend, liquidity gathering at the expense of sellers (potential for growth), buyers are very confident to keep the price in the range, introduction of BTC-ETF in Hong Kong, which will only attract new investors and their money.”- she said

RLinda‘s analysis points out that while the $64,500 level is a crucial hurdle for Bitcoin, it’s equally important to consider the support levels that underpin the current price structure.
Key liquidity pools are observed between $59,300 and $59,500. Breaching these levels could lead to a significant price surge. However, support levels at $61,500, $60,200, and particularly $59,300 must hold to prevent further declines. If these support zones are crushed, Bitcoin could face a sharp downturn, challenging the bearish thresholds.
Market trends and strategic outlook
With increasing institutional interest, as demonstrated by substantial investments in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) the bullish sentiment around Bitcoin continues to solidify. 
RLinda advises traders to closely monitor the market’s reaction to significant price levels and adjust their strategies accordingly, whether they are targeting bounce plays or preparing for potential false breakouts.
A crucial risk zone to watch is around $58,900. A breach here could indicate mounting downward pressure, confirming a bearish trend for Bitcoin. 
Conversely, maintaining momentum above the $64,500 resistance level could confirm the market’s bullish outlook, setting Bitcoin on a path toward higher valuations.

Elsewhere, a review of Bitcoin’s technical analysis shows a bullish momentum. A summary of the one-day gauges recommends ‘buy’ at 11; whole moving averages are for a ‘buy’ at 10. Despite Oscillators remaining  ‘neutral’ at 8,  there is a strong sentiment among traders anticipating an upward movement in price.
Overall, the market remains poised on the edge of a potential movement, likely setting the stage for an upcoming rally.

Bitcoin price can target $73,000 soon if this happens


Bitcoin (BTC) continues its recovery journey following a sharp decline that saw the flagship cryptocurrency plummet to as low as $56,000. 
Currently, Bitcoin is encountering resistance at the $65,000 mark, with market participants suggesting that breaching this level could propel the digital asset to above $70,000.
In this context, crypto analyst RLinda shared insights in a TradingView post on May 4, emphasizing the significance of monitoring a price target of $64,500.


According to the analysis, should Bitcoin break through and consolidate its price above this threshold, it could pave the way for further upward momentum, potentially pushing the price towards $73,000.

She highlighted that a breakout and consolidation above the $64,500 mark could signal a shift in market sentiment, transitioning from a neutral or bearish stance to a bullish one. This change in market dynamics could attract more investors, further fueling Bitcoin’s ascent.

“All eyes on 64500. Breakthrough and consolidation of the price above this level will be the reason for further growth to $73,000. A breakout and consolidation of the price above this zone ($64,500) may cause further growth,” the expert said. 

The expert also observed a local consolidation phase on the shorter timeframes, indicating that Bitcoin appears to be strengthening by 14% and testing a crucial area. This suggests a level of confidence in Bitcoin’s current trajectory.
Bitcoin’s risk areas to watch 
However, it’s important to note that the market expert pointed out that Bitcoin is not totally out of the woods yet, identifying a potential risk zone of around $58,900. 
Amidst the swirling projections surrounding Bitcoin’s price trajectory, the cryptocurrency faced a sluggish start to May, with bears seemingly gaining the upper hand over bulls. This resulted in Bitcoin’s price dipping to $56,000, marking its lowest point in approximately two months. 
The heightened volatility emerged following the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain interest rates.
Bitcoin found some resilience in the wake of lower-than-expected United States employment data. This development will likely pressure the Fed to consider initiating an interest rate cut.
Furthermore, activity within the exchange-traded fund (ETF) sphere appears to influence Bitcoin. Particularly noteworthy were the first inflows for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in nearly three months, signaling renewed investor confidence.
Bitcoin price analysis
By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $63,779, boasting one-day gains of nearly 1%. On the weekly timeframe, BTC has seen an increase of about 0.26%.

Additionally, Bitcoin’s technical indicators, which are predominantly bullish, mirror the current market momentum. A summary of the one-day metrics retrieved from TradingView suggests a ‘buy’ rating at 11 while moving averages also indicate a ‘buy’ sentiment at 10. Oscillators are currently at a ‘neutral’ stance, tallying at 8.
Bitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView
In summary, all eyes are on Bitcoin bulls to sustain the cryptocurrency above the $63,000 mark and propel it towards the $65,000 threshold. Achieving this milestone would position the asset favorably for a potential resurgence towards the $70,000 mark.

Top Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Hit $150,000 In 2025, Here’s Why


                            In the last week, Bitcoin has shown much resilience bouncing back above the $60,000 zone after a significant decline to below the $57,000 price zone. As Bitcoin bulls gather momentum to possibly initiate the crypto bull run, top analyst and market expert Peter Brandt has backed BTC to attain a particular six-figure digit value by 2025.


No Other Market Like Bitcoin, Brandt Says
In a blog post on May 3, Peter Brandt shared some insights on Bitcoin in celebration of his 50th anniversary in future markets trading. The veteran analyst described his experience with the maiden cryptocurrency as a “once-in-a-lifetime trade, never to be equaled”.

Brandt states that Bitcoin is a unique asset in comparison to commodities such as gold, cattle, iron ore, copper,  and even other cryptocurrencies such as altcoins and meme coins. He claims that BTC owes this uniqueness to its operational nature as well as its price behavior.
Analyzing BTC price history, Brandt notes that the coin has repeatedly produced exponential gains in the past not seen with any other trading asset. And while these gains are followed by significant corrections, the overall price performance sets BTC apart from other assets. 
Another aspect of Bitcoin’s uniqueness as highlighted by Brandt is that the asset’s volatility is also evident in its downturns resulting in a decline of more than 50% and even 75%. Therefore, Bitcoin exerts a special ability to generate substantial profits while also causing significant losses.
Now, following BTC’s parabolic price nature, Brandt predicts the asset is on course to reach $150,000 by 2025. Interestingly, if the bulls maintain market control, the analyst believes Bitcoin could rise as high as $300,000 beyond 2026.


BTC Price Overview
At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $63,303 having encountered serious resistance in the $64,000 price zone. The maiden cryptocurrency currently looks to be in consolidation and could be preparing for another possible breakout. 
If Bitcoin embarks on a bull run, investors would be hoping for a return to its all-time high value of $73,750. However, in the advent of more selling pressure in the future, BTC could drop below $60,000 again. Nevertheless, Bitcoin remains the diamond of the crypto bull season with several analysts hyping the digital asset to trade above $100,000 within the next 12 to 15 months.

Kraken Pro Expands Margin Trading with Shiba Inu Cryptocurrency, Emphasizing Community-Driven Growth



                    

Kraken Pro, a prominent U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, has recently announced the addition of new margin trading pairs, featuring Shiba Inu (SHIB), a popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency. 



This new offering allows SHIB to be traded on margin against the U.S. dollar. 




The exchange has set the maximum leverage for these transactions at three times, with a limit of 1.5 billion SHIB for both long and short positions.



Shiba Inu, known as an Ethereum-based meme coin, was first launched in 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. 



The coin was conceptualized to explore what could happen if a cryptocurrency was entirely community-driven. 




This initiative poses the question: “What would happen if a cryptocurrency project was 100% run by its community?”



Four years after its inception, Shiba Inu has risen to become the 11th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which now stands at about $13.49 billion. 



Alongside SHIB, the Shiba Inu ecosystem comprises other cryptocurrencies such as BONE and LEASH, accumulating a market capitalization of approximately $180 million.

The ecosystem also includes Shibarium, a layer-2 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain, which was launched in August 2023. 



Since its launch, Shibarium has locked in a total value of $2.46 million. 



The blockchain statistics for Shiba Inu are notable, with 105,393 accounts, 1.79 million addresses, 415.52 million completed transactions, and 2,265 verified smart contracts, according to Shibariumscan.



The growth and development of Shiba Inu reflect its significant evolution from a mere dog-inspired meme to a substantial crypto ecosystem. 



Its primary token, SHIB, not only enjoys widespread acceptance as a payment method across various large platforms but also shows promise for further expansion with its continued inclusion on major trading platforms. 



This progress underscores the coin’s potential beyond the typical expectations of a meme-based cryptocurrency.

Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) to Explode 12,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Dogecoin and Bonk Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK) made astronomical returns, and Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Doctor Pepe (DOCPEPE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 12,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




DOCPEPE will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Doctor Pepe.



Currently, Doctor Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DOCPEPE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – 3n8HMVVfMF2uqdpts5TUETAHUrvD1AFg8V1XLahpeTT8 – in the receiving field.




DOCPEPE currently has a market cap of just under $15,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Analyst Says Bottom Is In for Altcoin Markets, Predicts Crypto Rally Following Weak Economic Data - The Daily Hodl


								Popular analyst Michaël van de Poppe believes that crypto is gearing up for a marketwide rally amid signs of slowing economic activity.
Van de Poppe tells his 716,300 followers on the social media platform X he’s bullish on crypto after the US labor market missed estimates in April.










With unemployment rising to 3.9% and average hourly earnings growing less than expected, the analyst believes that the Fed will be forced to turn on the money printers to support the job market.
“Terrible economic data -> DXY (US dollar index) down, additionally the case for QE (quantitative easing) and rate cuts will increase and therefore risk-on assets rally.
Bitcoin back [above] $61,600.
FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) was the low for the markets and the altcoin bull market has started.”
Looking at the market capitalization of all altcoins, the trader predicts that the alt market will witness a consolidation period before rallying to fresh all-time highs.
“The total altcoin market capitalization generally has seen the bottom of this correction. I think $880-$920 billion is the area where it’s going to stabilize, before a run towards the all-time high is on the horizon.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
The analyst also says that the return of retail traders is now in sight. He believes they will enter the crypto markets once altcoins print sizeable gains.
“Retail isn’t even in the markets, while Bitcoin is around the all-time highs.
When will they come back?
It will probably be after this summer when altcoins start to lift off.
They hold altcoins, so when they start to turn, they jump back in.
This means you’re still early.”

Token distribution tactics should focus on real value, not hype, says Uniswap founder - Crypto Briefing




While initial interest in blockchain projects might be sparked by marketing strategies like airdrops, what truly matters is what keeps users engaged with the project in the long run. Uniswap founder Hayden Adams shared his opinion on good token distribution, suggesting that token marketing should focus on providing real value, rather than merely building hype.“Don’t market token price – if you tweet about how your token is going to moon or hire influencers, or marketing firms to do so I assume you’re just trying to get rich quick vs build real value,” Adam noted in a recent discussion on the ethics of token distribution.Adam also outlined several principles he believes should guide token distributions, including the avoidance of ambiguous teasers and the necessity for real liquidity from day one.“Don’t farm the farmers – teasing and creating ambiguity around a token distribution to grow your numbers is bad behavior. If you don’t know yet, don’t speculate publicly. If you do know but are not ready to share full details, don’t tease them out. Just share real details when ready,” Adam stated.He additionally criticized the creation of low-float tokens, which he considers “malicious,” and the manipulation of token supply to exploit unit bias.“You don’t need to work with exchanges or market makers. It’s so easy. Just distribute enough tokens publicly that real price discovery happens on DEX. People should start thinking in FDV not [market cap] when valuing these things,” Adam noted. “Don’t create absurdly high token supply to farm people with unit bias, this is also bad behavior,” he added.Adam further advised against stinginess in token distribution. According to him, giving away a significant portion of tokens to the community shows a commitment to the community’s growth and trust. “If you don’t think the community deserves a significant amount, don’t release a token,” he stated.The Uniswap founder stressed the importance of making deliberate and well-considered decisions regarding token distribution. According to him, projects should be able to stand behind their choices with confidence and clear reasoning, without having to constantly defend themselves or apologize for their actions.“Put real thought and care into your decisions – so you can stand behind them and explain your rationale. Don’t end up in a situation where you’re fighting or apologizing to crypto twitter. Create something you’re proud of and stand behind it,” he stated.Adam’s comments follow recent debates surrounding token airdrops and distributions of several prominent projects, which attracted mixed opinions from the communities after announcing their tokenomics.A highly-anticipated token airdrop from LayerZero also received criticism and praise for its approach to Sybil behavior.

Binance-Listed Project Makes Official Statement on its Altcoin After Heavy Criticism - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a recent development, Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons expressed his concerns about the token offering of the cryptocurrency project Sui.
Bons criticized that more than 8 billion SUIs have been staked and more than 84% of the staked supply is controlled by the founding team. He also pointed out that the founders control most of the supply without any lock-in period and legal guarantees.


In response to these doubts expressed by the community, Sui clarified in his official response that the founders of MystenLabs do not control the Sui Foundation treasury, community reserve, staking allowances, or tokens allocated to investors. According to the statement, Sui Foundation is the largest owner of locked tokens.

In the official statement made by Sui, the following was emphasized:






“Recently, there have been some misleading posts about Sui's token offering. Let's clarify the situation, starting with the basics: locked tokens are locked by third-party custodians. They cannot be moved and are securely stored until unlocked according to Sui's token emission program. Additionally, 100% of the staking rewards earned by the Sui Foundation are returned to the community and included in the public emissions program.”

Brace for 'the biggest altseason' with $4 trillion altcoin market cap in sight


Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent surge to a record $73,750, followed by a pullback to $61,000, has set the stage for what many in the cryptocurrency sector believe could be the onset of an altcoin season. Diverse predictions from analysts hint at a massive upswing in altcoin valuations.
While Bitcoin traditionally kickstarts market cycles with a strong surge, the real action often unfolds during its consolidation phases, where other cryptocurrencies typically take the lead. This trend is expected to be more pronounced in the upcoming period, fueled by varying forecasts from leading analysts.
The integration of decentralized finance (DeFi), advancements in blockchain scalability, and the expanding use of smart contracts are key factors contributing to a potential altcoin rally, which could significantly alter the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.


Expert predictions on altcoin breakouts
Ted, an expert analyst, recently shared an analysis on X (formerly Twitter) suggesting a significant upturn in the altcoin market. 
He pointed out a potential breakout, underpinned by technical patterns like the inverse head-and-shoulders formation, hinting at a bullish trend that could push the total market cap to $4 trillion. 
This growth is expected to unfold over the coming months, potentially reigniting significant interest from retail investors.

Furthermore, another trader and analyst Moustache highlighted in a recent post that “we are entering the largest altcoin season in at least four years”, drawing parallels from historical data.

On April 24, he noted that the total market cap of altcoins, represented by TOTAL2, had completed the ABC-correction phases of the Wyckoff method and was experiencing a breakout. This has stirred anticipation among crypto investors, as altcoins often offer higher risk-to-reward returns.
Despite these optimistic assessments, there’s a contrasting signal from the altcoin season index by Blockchain Center.
According to this index:

“If 75% of the top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days), it is Altcoin Season.”

Top 50 performance over the last season. Source. Blockchain Center.
The index shows that only 51% of the top 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. As the index is below 75, it suggests that it is not yet officially altcoin season, providing a more cautious perspective amid the enthusiastic forecast.
While the enthusiasm around an impending altcoin season is palpable, driven by technological advances and bullish analyst predictions, the more cautious altcoin season index reminds investors of the risks and uncertainties in predicting market movements. 
This blend of optimism and caution underscores the complex and dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets, where opportunities and risks coexist.

Bitcoin: Here's how long you should wait for BTC's rally to $71K - AMBCrypto



BTC’s price moved marginally in the last 24 hours. 
Metrics and indicators suggested that BTC might turn volatile in the next seven days. 

Several investors speculated a fresh bull rally for Bitcoin [BTC] as its price gained upward momentum on the 3rd of May. 
However, the growth dropped as the king of cryptos’ price only moved marginally in the last 24 hours. Does this hint at yet another price correction? 
Is Bitcoin actually bullish?
Moustache, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting a few developments that hinted towards a bull rally. 
For the uninitiated, BTC’s price plummeted under $61k on the 30th of April. However, the king coin managed to come back above that mark, turning it into a support and hinting at a further price uptick. 
The tweet highlighted that BTC bounded up after touching a key trendline. Historically, whenever BTC’s price rebounded after touching the trendline, its price has risen sharply. 
Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) broke above a falling wedge pattern. This indicated that the RSI would increase, which supported the possibility of BTC’s bull run. 
AMBCrypto’s look at Glassnode’s data revealed yet another bullish signal. We found that Bitcoin’s reserve risk gained upward momentum inside the green zone. 
Each time this happened in the past, BTC’s price gained bullish momentum.
Source: Glassnode
What to expect from BTC
Though these aforementioned metrics looked bullish, BTC’s price action didn’t correspond. As per CoinMarketCap, BTC’s price only moved marginally in the last 24 hours. 
At the time of writing, the coin was trading at $63,368.70 with a market capitalization of over $1.25 trillion. 
However, investors mustn’t lose hope yet, as a few metrics hint at an increase in BTC’s volatility.

 AMBCrypto’s analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed that BTC’s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven days’ average, suggesting low selling pressure. 
The coin’s Coinbase premium was also green, meaning that buying sentiment was dominant among U.S. investors. 
Source: CryptoQuant
A few of the market indicators also suggested that BTC could turn volatile in a northward direction in the next seven days. 
Notably, the coin’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp uptick. Its MACD displayed the possibility of a bullish crossover.

If BTC manages to turn volatile next week, then it will be crucial for the coin to go above the $66.9k resistance level. A successful breakout above that level could allow BTC to touch $71k.
If everything remains bullish, then BTC can even cross its all-time high in coming days.

Uniswap CEO weighs In on ethical token distribution

Hayden Adams, Uniswap’s founder and CEO, has outlined his take on ethical considerations for effective token distribution. This comes a few days after the crypto community raised concerns about the transparency and fairness of token distribution on EigenLayer.In an X post, Adams emphasized that he was discussing tokens, not points. He then criticized the practice of teasing and creating ambiguity during token distribution to inflate engagement metrics.Adams cautioned against public speculation, mainly when the team is uncertain about future developments. He advised against teasing if one possesses information about a token distribution but does not plan to disclose the details.Source:  Hayden AdamsUsers who felt left out of the recently announced EigenLayer users who felt left out on a recently announced airdrop lashed out at the restaking protocol’s Monday announcement — highlighting its nontransferable token structure, aggressive geo-restrictions, and an apparently short snapshot period.The Uniswap executive strongly disapproved of low float tokens, considering them malicious and his biggest pet peeve. He believes that projects can effectively distribute tokens without relying on exchanges or market makers. He says the ideal approach is to distribute tokens openly, enabling genuine price discovery on decentralized exchanges (DEX).Adams also criticized the practice of creating an excessively high token supply to exploit people’s unit bias, stating that such an approach is unnecessary. Additionally, Adams advised token distributors against being too conservative, encouraging them to make a substantial portion of their tokens available for distribution.Related: SEC targets Uniswap Labs, raising concerns over open-source code liabilityHayden Adams cautioned against inadequate token distribution, particularly if the issuer does not believe the community deserves it. He also emphasized the importance of not revealing token prices during or before distribution. Any attempt to do so, whether through influencers or marketing firms, would raise suspicions about the project.According to Adams, this approach suggests that the issuer is prioritizing quick wealth over building real value. Token issuers and distributors are encouraged to maintain a straightforward distribution process, resonating with concerns raised due to recent industry rug pulls. Finally, the Uniswap executive urged token issuers to be thoughtful and transparent about their projects. He emphasized the importance of releasing a token they can be proud of and stand behind to avoid ridicule within the crypto community.EigenLayer, an Ethereum restaking protocol, distributed an additional 28 million EIGEN tokens to over 280,000 wallets following its initial airdrop, prompted by user concerns over the program’s restrictions.Magazine: The real risks to Ethena’s stablecoin model (are not the ones you think)

Vodafone Plans To Use SIM Card Tech For Blockchain-based Digital Wallets - Coin Edition


							

David Palmer underscored the importance of leveraging SIM card technology for blockchain integration.
Existing Reports show that 8 billion mobile devices will be in use by 2030.
Digital wallets on mobile phones will surge to 5.6 billion by 2030.




Vodafone Blockchain Lead and PairPoint CPO David Palmer has emphasized the pivotal role of mobile phones as the primary gateway to digital applications and commerce. In a recent interview, Palmer underscored the importance of leveraging SIM card technology for blockchain integration.







Discussing with Brian McGleenon, a renowned finance journalist, Palmer highlighted the sheer scale of mobile phone usage, citing a report predicting that 8 billion devices will be in use by 2030. He forecasted a mass adoption of blockchain-based digital wallets on mobile phones, predicting a surge to 5.6 billion wallets by 2030.



According to Palmer, the mobile phone is the touchpoint between people and accessing applications and doing business. With SIM cards as the soul of mobile phones, Palmer highlighted that his company is focusing on linking SIM cards to digital identity and blockchains.  The PairPoint CPO noted that his organization will use cryptography in the SIM cards for the planned integration.



Emphasizing the anticipated surge in digital wallets, Palmer identified the innovation as the gateway between people and financial services. He considers such wallets as tools to hold digital identity and other credentials. Hence, his company plans to link the wallets to SIM cards with the hardware needed for future transactional models.









In his view, Palmer believes the long-term pathway for the proposed innovation is to use public blockchains. He acknowledged that recent blockchain developments like Layer 2 protocols and the Ethereum fork are bringing about faster blockchains. However, he cited regulations in financial services as a factor that could prevent the use of public blockchains. 



For integration solutions, Palmer noted that PaiPoint provides a collaborative structure enabling big enterprises to use public blockchains by linking to PairPoint’s chain. That way, they can execute the Smart Contract, utilizing the private blockchain.

Dogecoin could be on the road to a 'long-term bullish rally' - Analyst’s take


Meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to dominate the spotlight amid the ongoing market recovery, posting significant gains as it strives to breach the $0.20 resistance.
In this regard,  a crypto analyst using the pseudonym Behdark in a TradingView post on May 5 suggested that, based on technical indicators, Dogecoin’s price could be poised for a ‘long-term bullish rally.
The chart analysis indicated that Dogecoin may be in the final stages of a bullish diametric pattern with the current market position. Diametric patterns are characterized by alternating waves of price contraction and expansion, often leading to significant price swings.

Notably, the expert identified a robust support zone at $0.10, which has consistently propelled the price upwards whenever tested. This pattern suggests bullish market sentiment favoring higher prices, a factor that could instill confidence in Dogecoin traders.
DOGE enters bullish wave
According to the expert, Dogecoin appears to have entered a bullish wave marked by a notable uptrend. Compared to previous market movements, the current bullish wave is anticipated to last more than 500 days, signifying a potential sustained upward momentum.

“A strong support zone has formed on the chart (shown in green). Every time the price returns to this area, it will be rejected to the upside. From where we placed the green arrow on the chart, the price has entered a bullish wave,” the expert said. 

Additionally, the market analyst referenced a significant correction period lasting nearly 900 days preceding the current wave. In this case, such extended correction phases are typical in cryptocurrency markets and often precede substantial price movements. 
Dogecoin records spike in network activity 
Indeed, Dogecoin continues to be dominated by bullish sentiments, a trend also reflected in on-chain data. Notably, amidst the ongoing rally, data from IntoTheBlock highlighted increased network activity, contributing to sustained buying pressure surrounding the token.
For instance, data shared on May 3 indicated a significant spike in new Dogecoin addresses, with the platform adding 28,000 addresses on May 2 alone, marking a 102% increase from the monthly low observed earlier in the week.

At the same time, according to on-chain data, the coin appears to be experiencing renewed interest and engagement, evidenced by a surge in non-empty wallets. Insights provided by Santiment revealed a 27% increase in Dogecoin non-empty wallets over the last six months, totaling 6.6 million wallets.
In addition to network activity, Dogecoin is counting on other perennial catalysts to drive its price toward $0.20, a crucial level that could potentially propel the coin toward the $1 mark. Notably, investors are closely monitoring events involving Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.
In the latest development, Tesla’s payments page has been updated to include Dogecoin formally. Under this development,  DOGE will be accepted as payment for select Tesla merchandise. Furthermore, the potential role of DOGE in X Payments is a topic that has piqued investors’ interest. 
DOGE price analysis
By press time, DOGE was trading at $0.16 with daily gains of approximately 1.5%. On the weekly chart, the meme coin has seen an increase of nearly 8%.

In conclusion, it is worth noting that DOGE has increasingly traded in tandem with Bitcoin (BTC). Therefore, in addition to technical indicators and network activity, the token’s trajectory significantly hinges on how the maiden cryptocurrency performs in the market.

Solana-Based Dogwifhat and Dogecoin Pare Gains as Bitcoin Struggles to Reclaim $64K
