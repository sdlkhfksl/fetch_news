Are Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Due A Bounce? This Trader Sees 'Bull Flag' Forming For One Coin - Benzinga

Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD have experienced a turbulent month, but traders remain optimistic about their future prospects.What Happened: Renowned chart analyst Ali Martinez has predicted a bullish breakout for Shiba Inu, highlighting the formation of a bull flag on its daily chart. Martinez is placing buy orders around $0.000018343, anticipating a potential surge in Shiba Inu’s value to $0.000072323.Meanwhile, crypto trader YG Crypto analyzed Dogecoin’s recent performance, which saw a dramatic 40% price drop after reaching $0.228. Despite the sharp decline, Dogecoin is still trading above the crucial support level of $0.112-$0.123, which previously prevented a steeper fall.

Much Anticipated Altcoin Update Disappoints Again: 8 Weeks Postponed - Token Price Crashed in the Last Month - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bitcoin layer-2 project Stacks (STX) has announced a significant delay in the activation of the much-anticipated Nakamoto update. The delay was due to the need for an additional eight weeks of development time.
Mitchell Cuevas, who heads the Stacks Open Internet Foundation, detailed the reasons behind the delay in a recent blog post. Cuevas explained that, armed with more knowledge and practical experience with the features of the new network, the core developers determined that they needed a more advanced Signer resiliency/recovery system. This was something originally planned for a later release.



As a result, they anticipate an additional eight weeks of development and testing time before the second hard fork, which will bring Nakamoto features to us in 'Activation'. The new Signer flexibility features are expected to be completed by July 15, with Activation to begin on August 28.
Cuevas acknowledged his disappointment that the dates were changed so late. He wrote: “Fast blocks can't get here fast enough. However, this change is being made to ensure the security and liveness of the network upgrade.”





STX has lost approximately 40 percent of its value in the last month.

BONK surges 50%, flips FLOKI in market cap, but key hurdles remain - AMBCrypto



BONK Inu’s market cap rises to $1.40 billion, surpassing Floki Inu.
Despite overall memecoin market downturn, BONK gains nearly 50% in two weeks. 

As the broader crypto market continues to navigate turbulent waters with an overall downturn, the memecoin sector is not immune to the volatility, experiencing a significant drop of 13.3% in 24 hours. 
This decline has reduced the total market cap of meme coins to approximately $45.2 billion. Amid this general market retreat, a notable exception emerges—Bonk [BONK].
BONK becomes the fifth-largest memecoin
While the majority of meme coins have faced downward pressure, Bonk has charted a different course.
 Over the past two weeks, BONK has surged nearly 50%, contrasting sharply with the modest 3% gain of its peer, Floki Inu [FLOKI], according to recent data from CoinGecko. 
This growth has propelled BONK’s market valuation to $1.40 billion, enabling it to leapfrog over Floki Inu and secure its position as the fifth-largest memecoin in the market. 
As a result, BONK now stands as the 58th largest cryptocurrency globally, surpassing well-known names such as Aave [AAVE] and Algorand [ALGO].
Emerging on the cryptocurrency scene in December 2022, Bonk initially flew under the radar until it caught the market’s attention a year later with a dramatic price increase. 
This surge was fueled by robust investor interest, endorsements from influential figures within the crypto community, and its inclusion on several major cryptocurrency exchange platforms. 
Notably, BONK also ranks as the second-largest memecoin on the Solana [SOL] blockchain, trailing only Dogwifhat [WIF]. 
The latter experienced a significant market cap increase to nearly $5 billion at the end of March as well, before retracting to around $2.2 billion.
BONK: Market outlook
Despite the recent success of Bonk in overtaking its competition, technical analysis of both BONK and Floki Inu revealed potential challenges ahead.

Realistic or not, here’s BONK market cap in BTC’s terms

The daily chart for BONK indicated a bearish pattern, with the memecoin’s price recently triggering a liquidity pull on the buy side, suggesting a possible downturn as it targets the next swing low.

Floki Inu’s 8-hour chart mirrored this sentiment, indicating potential declines for both meme coins in the near future.

Stablecoin Giant Tether Strikes Gold: Achieves Record Net Profit Of $4.5 Billion In Q1


                            Stablecoin issuer Tether, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market behind the widely used USDT stablecoin, has released its audit statement for the first quarter of 2024, accompanied by a report conducted by independent accounting firm BDO. 
The report, which provides additional financial information beyond the reserves backing Tether’s fiat-denominated stablecoins, shows the company’s profit for the first quarter of the year, which saw an increased influx of capital into the market. 
Tether Q1 2024 Financials Soar
Digging into the numbers, the first quarter of 2024 proved highly profitable for Tether, with a net profit of $4.52 billion. 
The main contributors, the entities responsible for issuing stablecoins and managing reserves, reportedly generated approximately $1 billion of this profit from net operating gains, primarily from US Treasury holdings. The remaining profits were attributable to mark-to-market gains on Bitcoin (BTC) and gold positions.

The report also highlighted Tether’s success in increasing its direct and indirect holdings of US Treasuries to over $90 billion. This includes indirect exposure through overnight reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by US Treasuries and investments in US Treasuries through money market funds.

In a sign of significant growth, Tether also disclosed its net equity for the first time, revealing a figure of $11.37 billion as of March 31, 2024. This is an increase from the $7.01 billion equity reported as of December 31, 2023. 
The report also highlighted a $1 billion increase in excess reserves, which support the company’s stablecoin offerings, bringing the total to nearly $6.3 billion.
CEO Emphasizes Transparency And Stability
The BDO confirmation reiterated that Tether-issued tokens are 90% backed by cash and cash equivalents, underscoring the company’s stance on maintaining liquidity within the stablecoin ecosystem. Furthermore, the report revealed that over $12.5 billion worth of USDT was issued in the first quarter alone.
Tether Group’s strategic investments, which exceed $5 billion as of the report date, span various sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI) and data, renewable energy, person-to-person (P2P) communication, and Bitcoin Mining. 

In response to the latest report, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, expressed the company’s commitment to transparency, stability, liquidity, and responsible risk management. 
Ardoino highlighted Tether’s record-breaking profit benchmark of $4.52 billion and the company’s efforts to increase transparency and trust within the cryptocurrency industry. Ardoino further claimed:

In reporting not just the composition of our reserves, but now the Group’s net equity of $11.37 billion, Tether is again raising the bar in the cryptocurrency industry in the realms of transparency and trust.

If the SEC Thinks Ethereum Is a Security, Are ETH ETFs Doomed? - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsWill the SEC approve an Ethereum ETF this year?Optimism among market participants is fading—and now that the SEC’s stance on Ethereum as a security has been made public, those hopes may have been shot down for good.“If this SEC approves a spot Ethereum ETF before the election, I will eat my HODL hat,” Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at Van Eck, an Ethereum ETF applicant, told Decrypt. That’s because of a lawsuit filed last week by Ethereum software company Consensys against the SEC, which revealed that the Commission believes Ethereum (ETH) to be an unregistered security—and that the SEC has, for the last year, pursued investigations on that basis. Consensys wants a court to declare Ethereum as a non-security, preempting any forthcoming charges from the SEC. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.)To be clear, the SEC has yet to bring charges against Consensys, or anyone else, that formally allege Ethereum is a security. But the revelations in the Ethereum giant’s lawsuit have already had far-reaching implications, with top Washington lawmakers accusing SEC Chair Gary Gensler of lying to Congress last year about the agency’s position on ETH.While the long-term impact of SEC’s investigations into Ethereum plays out, in the more immediate term this means spot Ethereum ETFs likely aren’t happening—at least, not without another legal fight.Spot market Ethereum ETFs would allow Wall Street firms and investors to gain indirect exposure to ETH without having to deal with crypto exchanges or wallets. After a decade of denials from the SEC, spot Bitcoin ETFs finally gained approval for trading in the U.S. market in January—but only after Grayscale, one of the biggest digital asset managers in crypto, successfully sued the SEC to make it happen.Still, after Bitcoin ETFs got the green light, analysts assumed spot ETH ETFs were right behind, with approval likely by summer. Now analysts and ETF issuers on Wall Street aren’t so sure.Ethereum ETF applicants are expected to hear back from the SEC regarding approval by May 23. By last month, analysts were already cooling on the prospect that these initial filings would gain approval; this week’s news has only further convinced experts that ETH ETF applications have a ways to go. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, opined on Twitter this week that the SEC’s now-evident position on ETH’s security status likely means spot ETH ETFs aren’t coming to Wall Street any time soon. And that’s because ETFs based on commodities and securities operate on different rules, he said. It doesn’t appear, though, that the SEC’s apparent hostility towards Ethereum has spooked would-be ETH ETF issuers—at least not yet. A spokesperson for crypto fund manager 21Shares, the first-ever Ethereum ETF applicant in the U.S., told Decrypt that the firm remains committed to seeing its petition approved. Van Eck, a more traditional Wall Street investment firm, remains all-in as well. The company’s digital assets research chief Matthew Sigel believes the product will be approved “in time.” But he emphasized that Van Eck’s experience bringing crypto to Wall Street has never been without conflict. This week’s news constituted just one additional bump in a road the firm always expected to be long and winding.“This has been war since January of 2022, it's been a war for the entire Biden tenure,” he said. “Part of our investment thesis for this asset class is that it will continue to win the bigger battles in the courts over time.”Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Solana-to-Bitcoin cross-chain bridge aims for Q3 2024 launch

Solana-to-Bitcoin cross-chain bridge Zeus Network will launch its Zeus Program Library (ZPL) that connects the two ecosystems by Q3 2024. “These ZPL-Assets unlock a world of opportunities on Solana,” Zues Network wrote on May 1. “Facilitating activities like DeFi, GameFi, SocialFi, DePIN, and more, which were previously challenging on the Bitcoin blockchain.”ZPL is a set of Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) programs that enables developers to integrate native Solana support into decentralized applications and power transactions across multiple blockchains. “ZPL-Assets can be either fungible (cryptocurrencies) or non-fungible (NFTs), representing a wide range of digital assets,” commented Zeus Network, continuing: “With a market cap of approximately 1.2 trillion dollars, and over 11,000 Runes generating over $135 million in fees within the first week on the Bitcoin blockchain, the potential for value transfer is immense.”Through ZPL and bridging protocol Apollo, users deposit their Bitcoin (BTC) and, in return, receive ZPL-wrapped zBTC tokens, which can then be used to engage with decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, borrowing, lending, gaming and SocialFi within the Solana ecosystem. Developers plan to further expand ZPL-supported assets on Solana to Bitcoin Runes and Ordinals, dubbed “zRuneX” and “zOrdX,” respectively. Other tasks in its Q3 roadmap include enabling Bitcoin staking on its Apollo mainnet. Zeus Network is backed by Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko and Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali. On April 8, the protocol secured a $8 million funding round at a valuation of $100 million. Released in April, Bitcoin Runes is a new token standard that expands the functionality of the Bitcoin blockchain by enabling users to tokenize various real-world assets such as real estate, stocks, commodities or even other cryptocurrencies such as stablecoins.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Ordinals is a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each satoshi, or 1/100 millionth of a Bitcoin, enabling tracking transfer, and minting of unique assets on the namesake blockchain. The Bitcoin decentralized application ecosystem has been experiencing a revival with the invention of such novel protocols. Last month, Orders Exchange completed integration with the Bitcoin Runes protocol to allow the issuance of fungible tokens on the native network and constructed a Bitcoin asset bridge with MicroVisionChain that enables BRC-20 token swaps. Related: BONK, POPCAT and Solana memecoins stay green even as Bitcoin price drops

Ronin's Path From Curated Ethereum Gaming to 'Pervasively Permissionless' - Decrypt

Ronin goes against the grain when it comes to the Web3 philosophy. For many in the crypto space, the beauty of the blockchain is that it’s permissionless and that anyone can build without a centralized authority. Instead, the Ethereum sidechain gaming network instead opts for a closed, curated approach at present.There’s a reason for this kind of early approach, the team says—and it's hard to argue with success, given the vast rise in Ronin players in recent months, plus its surge to an all-time high price in March ahead of the recent markets cooldown.And there's a path to a “pervasively permissionless” Ronin network ahead.“There are too many developers, too many applications, and too many games,” Sky Mavis and Ronin co-founder Jeff “Jihoz” Zirlin told Decrypt. “There are more applications, games, and developers than there are actual real people using these applications.”Many open blockchains have an “overabundance” of games, Zirlin believes, while the relatively small number of gamers that are playing in this space struggle to sift through the good and the bad. To battle this dilemma, Ronin curates the games that are allowed on its network.In his personal time—and aside from crypto games—Zirlin only plays games by Nintendo, Blizzard, and Supercell. They’re giants of the industry known for releasing few games, and often really beloved and massively popular games at that.Sky Mavis co-founder Jeff Zirlin. Image: Jeff ZirlinBy curating Ronin’s game library, he believes that the network is aligning itself with these game publishers. In fact, he suggests that the Web3 element “adds another layer on top” by incentivizing gamers to support the network through its token.“This strategy emphasizes quality over quantity, allowing us to work closely with fewer teams and ensure their long-term success in the evolving landscape of Web3 gaming,” Zirlin explained. “[A Twitter poll] showed us that 40% of all [Axie] gamers were onboarded by a friend or family member. So these are insane levels of evangelism.”In turn, Ronin accounts for 30% of all active Web3 gamers, the largest share by some margin with Polygon in second at 17%, according to Footprint Analytics. Despite the model working for Ronin, most of Web3 opts against such an approach.“In order to win, you need to do non-consensus things. That’s where most of the strategic leverage is,” Zirlin explained. “People want chaos, I guess, in Web3. But for the adoption of a new technology, you need to be more zen. You don't want to confuse people, because the technology is already confusing enough.”Thus far, a curated approach appears to have served Ronin well. The doors will only be closed for so long, however, as Zirlin admits that open models do have advantages in the long run—and Ronin is indeed eyeing up a more open future.Looking down the path, one major hurdle in Ronin’s way is scalability. Currently, Ronin claims, the network can handle 7.5 million daily transactions without congestion. This may not be enough once the network is opened to all builders, so Sky Mavis is actively exploring scaling solutions to increase what Ronin can handle. But scaling isn’t just a technical leap, said Zirlin—it’s also a cultural challenge.“Ultimately, the key factor in scalability is not just technical superiority, but also user adoption and loyalty,” Zirlin explained. “Similar to the console wars of the past, where players chose platforms based on where their friends were, our focus is on curating games that draw players to Ronin.”Once Ronin turns “pervasively permissionless,” Zirlin said, he expects the number of games deploying on Ronin to accelerate. He hopes one of these games will help drive growth for the network, as current game Pixels is doing at present and Axie Infinity did back during the play-to-earn boom in 2021—but this time without such a heavy-handed approach from Ronin.When Ronin plans open up the network is still undecided. Once this path ends and Ronin opens its doors, the network will begin to eye up its next big transformation—expanding beyond gaming.“The endgame is to create an ecosystem that seamlessly blends gaming with ecommerce and payment apps,” Zirlin told Decrypt.  "We believe the path to getting there is by bootstrapping adoption and attention through gaming, and then expanding into payments and ecommerce, thereby disrupting the predatory banking system and credit card industry.”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Starbucks’ Shocking Q2 Miss: CEO Spills the Beans on What’s Brewing for 2024 | Cryptoglobe


                                
Earlier today, in an interview with Jim Cramer on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street,” Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ: SBUX) CEO Laxman Narasimhan provided a candid look at the company’s disappointing fiscal Q2 2024 results. Yesterday, Starbucks issued a detailed press release shedding light on the complexities and strategic adjustments the company is navigating through these challenging times.



Starbucks reported a 2% decline in consolidated net revenues, amounting to $8.6 billion, which the company attributes to a complex operating environment. Both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share were recorded at $0.68, marking a significant decrease from the previous year, with GAAP earnings per share down by 14% and Non-GAAP earnings per share down by 8%.



Key performance highlights from the fiscal second quarter include:



Global Comparable Store Sales: There was a 4% decline overall, driven by a sharp 6% decrease in transactions but partially offset by a 2% increase in average ticket prices.North American Performance: Comparable store sales in North America fell by 3%, with transactions down 7%, though mitigated slightly by a 4% rise in average ticket prices.International Markets: International comparable store sales saw a 6% decrease, with an 11% decline in China due to significant drops in both ticket prices and transaction volumes.



The company also continued its expansion, opening 364 net new stores globally, bringing the total count to 38,951 stores, split between company-operated and licensed outlets.



The operating margin showed a contraction, with GAAP operating margins decreasing by 240 basis points to 12.8%. This was primarily due to increased investments in store partner wages, benefits, and promotional activities. Despite these challenges, Starbucks is committed to its long-term strategy and is actively implementing the “Triple Shot Reinvention with Two Pumps” strategy, aimed at revitalizing the brand and ensuring future growth.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The Starbucks Rewards loyalty program reported an increase in 90-day active members in the U.S. to 32.8 million, up by 6% from the previous year. This highlights a resilient aspect of Starbucks’ customer engagement strategy despite broader market challenges.



The Starbucks CEO remarked on the quarter’s performance, “In a highly challenged environment, this quarter’s results do not reflect the power of our brand, our capabilities, or the opportunities ahead.” He emphasized the comprehensive roadmap and action plans the company has laid out to navigate through the current complexities.



CFO Rachel Ruggeri also commented on the financial discipline and strategic focus, highlighting the company’s continued commitment to capital allocation and operational efficiencies as they steer through dynamic market conditions.



The Starbucks share price closed at $74.44, down 15.88% on the day.

Chinese Police Reveals Airdrop Scam! Which Project's Airdrops Were Targeted? Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Chinese police have captured a suspect involved in a major cryptocurrency fraud case. The individual is accused of creating multiple fake identities to illegally claim STRK airdrops.
Chinese Police Capture Suspect in Major Cryptocurrency Scam Case
It is alleged that the suspect, whose identity is kept secret due to ongoing investigations, exploited the STRK airdrop system by assuming the identities of other participants.


The suspect is believed to have submitted more than 40 ECMP forms, thus demanding an estimated 40,000 STRK coins belonging to the victims of this fraud scheme.
The suspect reportedly sought out relevant work submitted by others in the STRK community, assumed the identities of those individuals, and used that information to submit ECMP forms.





This sophisticated method of identity theft has raised concerns about security measures put in place to protect participants in cryptocurrency airdrops.

Chinese police took swift action after receiving reports of fraudulent activities. Their quick action enabled the suspect to be caught and the stolen STRK coins to be recovered.


The case is currently under further investigation as authorities work to ensure the stolen coins are returned to their rightful owners.
This incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions. It underlines the need for robust security measures and careful monitoring to prevent such fraudulent activities.





Chinese police have assured the public that they are committed to protecting the integrity of the cryptocurrency market and will continue to crack down on such fraudulent activities.
They also urged the public to be careful and report any suspicious activity related to cryptocurrency transactions.

Economic Wobbles Hit Bitcoin Hard | Bankless


Macro Mania. Crypto assets are getting volatile as macro is once again dominating the narrative. Is the bottom in, or is the downside just getting started?Bitcoin fell below the key $60k level that had supported price for the past two months this morning, making its way all the way down to $56.6k prior to the Federal Open Market Commission’s (FOMC’s) interest rate decision announcement.Despite acknowledging that BTC may have further downside to come in the near future, some traders have gotten bullish on the possibility that much of the selling has subsided, believing that alts front-ran the dump and that their relative strength today will mark a bottom against BTC.Near term price projections are always murky, but crypto bulls remain confident on the future trajectory of asset valuations, with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood raising her price target to $2.3M BTC and noting that the coin could trade as high as $3.8M should it receive increased institutional interest.
BTC has emerged as the best performing asset of the past decade; nonetheless, it has not existed during a true recessionary period. With signs that the global economy is rolling over, the crypto industry may soon undergo its most significant test to date…Private sector employment numbers released last week indicates that the US economy lost 192k jobs during the third quarter of 2023. This figure represents a substantial 686k discrepancy compared to the monthly U.S. non-farm payroll data, spawning concern about the reliability of the data that market participants have used to reinforce their beliefs in a strong labor market.The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed that job openings in March fell to their lowest since February 2021, with the construction sector posting the largest job opening drop on record!Simultaneously, the ratio of job openings per unemployed person, along with quit rates, has dropped to near pre-COVID levels as the number of hires plunged to the lowest level since January 2018, suggesting that while there is demand to find and retain jobs, employers have little demand for labor. Similar data patterns have preceded a fall off in employment.
In commodities markets, oil prices dropped nearly 3% this morning after inventory levels exceeded analysts' expectations, signaling potential uncertainty in future economic growth and the commensurate demand for this key commodity input.Moreover, troubling US manufacturing data compounds on economic concerns, revealing an increase in input costs alongside a decrease in new orders, a lethal combination of data that indicates stagflation and complicates the business outlook for producers.While the FOMC decided to hold its rate target at 5.5%, the Committee included a bullish surprise for markets that allowed risk assets to bounce off the initial announcement, decreasing the amount of Treasury securities it will roll off the balance sheet per month from $60B to $25B beginning in June, providing a supportive bid for yields given the increased need to repurchase expiring securities.The Federal Reserve maintains that it will hold rates at high levels until there are clear signs of progress towards their long term 2% inflation target, yet the economy is beginning to demonstrate weakness.Once the cuts commence should deteriorating demand continue to weigh on prices, it is unclear if they will be able to incite a rally out of recession, considering their arrival has historically coincided with worsening economic conditions.

Top 10 Altcoins Developers Focused on in April Revealed - Etheruem Not in First Place - Bitcoin Sistemi


April has come to an end and Bitcoin price closed the month in the red zone after a long period of time. Today, the cryptocurrency market has lost blood in general and daily losses have reached double digits in most altcoins.
Despite this, cryptocurrency developers continue to develop altcoins, most of which are open source. Here are the altcoins that developers focused on the most during April and the ranking of their developer scores:



Optimism (OP) – 541
Hedera (HBAR) – 459
Cardano (ADA) – 432
Chainlink (LINK) – 397
Polkadot (DOT) – 390
Ethereum (ETH) – 323
Cosmos (ATOM) – 301
Internet Computer (ICP) – 295
MultiversX (EGLD) – 247
Aptos (APT) – 228


It is noteworthy that there are altcoins with much lower market values than ETH, ahead of the world's largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH). Optimism, which ranks first, stands out as a layer-2 blockchain that aims to help scale Ethereum.
This data was obtained through cryptocurrency data provider Santiment and was created based on the Github profiles of altcoin projects. However, it is important to remember that developer activity will not have a direct impact on the price of a cryptocurrency.

EigenLayer Withdrawals Accelerate After Airdrop Backlash - The Defiant

Nearly 14,000 wallets have triggered withdrawals from the Ethereum restaking protocol since April 29.DeFi traders are leaving EigenLayer in droves since the much-hyped Ethereum restaking protocol released its airdrop allocations two days ago.Since April 29, almost 14,000 wallets have initiated withdrawals from the protocol, accounting for roughly 13% of its user base.EigenLayer WithdrawalsEigenLayer is DeFi’s third-largest protocol, with $14.5 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. It enables users to re-stake their Ether or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to earn additional yield by securing third-party applications called Actively Validated Services (AVS).Despite the large number of wallets, the pending withdrawals amount to less than 12,000 ETH ($35 million), according to a Dune dashboard. That’s barely 0.25% of EigenLayer’s TVL and indicates that smaller depositors are leaving the protocol.Daily LST WithdrawalsThe project is facing severe backlash from the DeFi community after it geo-blocked many countries, including the United States, and aggressively blocked VPN users from its EIGEN airdrop despite accepting deposits from these ‘prohibited jurisdictions’ during its growth phase.Airdrop recipients are also unhappy that the EIGEN token will not be transferable at launch, meaning that holders will be unable to trade their tokens. Many community members also criticized the linear distribution of EIGEN, which favours larger depositors.

Analyzing Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Future: Bullish or Bearish?


Shiba Inu (SHIB) stands at a critical point. As traders watch closely, SHIB faces potential turning points that could propel it to new highs or see it plummet to new lows. 
With key technical levels coming into play and market sentiment swinging, the meme coin’s immediate future is fraught with promising opportunities and significant risks.
The Dual Outlook on Shiba Inu (SHIB)
Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently teetering on a precarious edge. A crucial technical level supports the meme coin hovering around $0.000021, the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). 
This indicator is vital for SHIB’s short-term trajectory, serving as a psychological comfort for traders. Indeed, A breach below this level could send the price tumbling to the next significant support at the 200-day EMA, potentially dropping below $0.000010.

Conversely, SHIB has some potential bullish signals on the horizon. A bull flag formation on SHIB’s daily chart suggests that SHIB could be setting up for a significant upward move. 

Despite recent declines and broader market uncertainties impacting altcoins, there is anticipation of a bullish breakout targeting a rise to $0.000051. Resistance levels are currently seen at $0.000023 and $0.000025. 
Overcoming these barriers could propel SHIB into a bullish zone, reigniting investor interest and possibly signaling a broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market.

However, a sustained dip below $0.000021 could trigger extensive selling, eroding recent gains and dampening market sentiment.
As the crypto market navigates through turbulent waters, Shiba Inu stands at a crossroads. Its ability to maintain above pivotal support levels or break through resistance will likely dictate its path.

New Competitors Eating Away At Tether’s USDT Stablecoin Dominance: Kaiko Analytics - The Daily Hodl


								Market intelligence platform Kaiko Analytics reports that new competitors are chipping away at Tether’s (USDT) stablecoin dominance.
In a new report titled “Tether Loses Market Share,” Kaiko Analytics says that the stablecoin issuer’s market share over centralized exchange platforms (CEXs) has dipped 13% year-to-date (YTD) due to the growth of rival dollar-pegged digital assets, such as FDUSD and USDC.










“Despite its dominant market position, USDT’s market share on CEXs has been trending downwards, declining from 82% to 69% YTD. This decrease can be partly attributed to growing competition from stablecoins like FDUSD which benefit from Binance’s zero-fee promotions.
 USDC has also experienced a rise in its market share, signaling a growing preference for regulated alternatives. At present, stablecoins issued in the US make up 10% of the overall stablecoin trade volume.
 Only one of the top five stablecoins by market cap, Circle’s USDC, is regulated under state US money transmitter frameworks. Nevertheless, its share has increased from less than 1% in 2020 to 11% today.” According to Kaiko, other rivals such as Ethena (USDe), which uniquely offers yield, could also be cutting into Tether’s market dominance.
“Another reason for Tether’s declining market share could be linked to the emergence of innovative yield-bearing alternatives such as Ethena’s USDe. Since its launch in February, USDe’s volume has grown significantly, although it has retreated from April’s all-time high of more than $800 million following Ethena’s ENA airdrop.”
According to Tether’s 2024 Attestation Report, the firm posted a record-breaking $4.52 billion in profits during the first quarter of the year.

Is Bitcoin Bottom In? Analysts Forecast Bounce Back


                            As May 1st started, Bitcoin (BTC) faced a new correction that made the price stumble under the $60,000 support level. The flagship cryptocurrency has seen several retraces during this bull cycle, with BTC swiftly recovering the crucial support zones each time.
However, in the past 24 hours, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has struggled to regain its momentum. Some analysts believe Bitcoin’s bottom this cycle might be in as this correction officially became its deepest retrace.

Is The Bitcoin Bottom Here?
In the early hours of Tuesday, Bitcoin started to plunge from the $64,000 price range. As the day continued, BTC prolonged its fall to briefly trading around $59,958 – $59,191 before recovering.
This time, the recovery didn’t last long as Bitcoin’s price resumed its downward trajectory to $57,000. In an X thread, crypto trader Milkybull examined some data suggesting the bottom might finally be in.
According to the analyst, BTC is “following the 2017 PA.” This would suggest that “either the bottom is in or close.” Moreover, he urged investors to remember that while good news “usually signals the top,” bad news signals a bull market’s bottom.
In the thread, the trader pointed out that the Bitcoin Bull Market Support Band indicator historically serves strong support during BTC’s bull cycles. As a result, he considers that the flagship cryptocurrency might “wick through the support and bounce back.”

According to the analyst, Bitcoin and global liquidity are also strongly correlated, with BTC currently at a level it has previously bounced back from. These bouncebacks initiated “huge rallies across the crypto market” in October 2022 and October 2023.
Lastly, the thread highlighted that Bitcoin “is at a critical decision point for the local bottom.” The trader considers that while some call for a $48,000 bottom, the $51,000 support level might be where BTC bounces back to resume its cycle to this cycle’s top.
Bitcoin’s Deepest Retrace This Cycle
According to crypto analyst and trader Rekt Capital, this correction has officially been the deepest BTC retrace this cycle. Per the post, today’s -23.64% retrace surpasses the -22.91% retrace seen in February 2023.
The analyst also compared this cycle’s “Post-Halving” pullback to 2016’s. Moreover, the trader considers that this bullish cycle might be more similar to the 2016 one than investors think.


Previously, Rekt Capital listed three reasons these two cycles might be similar. Per the trader, the resemblances include the “Pre-Halving Re-Accumulation Range Breakout,” the “Pre-Halving Retrace Beginning,” and the “Similar Initial Reaction after the beginning of the Pre-Halving Retrace.”
After today’s retrace, the analyst added the “Continued downside in the three weeks after the Halving” as a fourth similarity between the 2016 and 2024 cycles. Like eight years ago, Bitcoin faces an “additional downside below the Range Low of its Re-Accumulation Range” in the three-week window after Bitcoin’s “Halving.”
Moreover, the analyst suggests that the current price development comes “as no surprise,” as it mirrors 2016’s “post-Halving Danger Zone.”
As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is trading at $57,794.89. This correction represents a 6.2% drop in the past 24 hours. Similarly, BTC is registering 13.4% and 17.7% price decreases in the weekly and monthly timeframes.

Is Binance founder CZ's sentence the boost BNB needed all along? - AMBCrypto



BNB tumbled over 6% in the 24-hour period owing to broader market bloodbath.
The positive commentary around the coin increased dramatically in the last 24–48 hours.

Binance Coin [BNB] suffered substantial losses in the last 24 hours, as the broader market downturn took its toll on the native token of the Binance ecosystem.
The fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap tumbled over 6% in the 24-hour period, data from CoinMarketCap showed.
However, on a monthly time frame, the coin performed comparatively better against other leading coins, nursing losses of just 6%.
That being said, BNB could be in for healthy gains in the short to medium term, as a major chapter, which fueled considerable FUD for the coin in the recent past, reached a conclusion.
A short-term bullish catalyst?
Binance’s ex-boss, Changpeng Zhao, popularly known as CZ, was sentenced to four months in prison, for the charges brought against him by the U.S. government.
The charges were severe, including violation of anti-money-laundering rules that allowed illicit transactions on the exchange.
The news of the announcement set the social circles buzzing. According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data, the mention of BNB on top crypto-focused social channels surged dramatically.
Interestingly, positive commentary around the coin exceeded bearish takes, as weighted sentiment entered the positive territory. This suggested a more favorable view of BNB’s next moves by the market.

Futures traders not hopeful of quick rebound
BNB’s sentiment in the derivatives market continued to be bearish.
The number of traders shorting the crypto increased considerably in the last 24 hours, AMBCrypto spotted using Coinglass’ Long/Shorts Ratio indicator.

Read Binance Coin’s [BNB]Price Prediction 2024-25

The Open Interest (OI), or the money invested in active futures contracts of BNB, dropped 1.27% in the last 24 hours to $564 million.
While this might be due to the broader market downturn, BNB could see investments trickling in once the sentiment improves.

Legendary Investor Cathie Wood Increases Her $1.5 Million Bitcoin Price Prediction - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood is known for her bold predictions regarding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Despite the skepticism surrounding these predictions, they continue to attract the attention of investors and analysts alike.
At an investor day in New York, Wood made a surprising prediction. According to Wood, Bitcoin price could rise to a staggering $3.8 million by 2030.


In his own words, Wood expressed his prediction as follows:

“Last year, we put forward our bullish scenario for Bitcoin. This figure was $1.5 million. With the institutional green light provided by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), albeit difficult, according to our analysis, institutional investors invested a little more than 5% of their portfolios in Bitcoin. “If they do, and we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the estimate I gave you.”


Wood's prediction is based on the assumption that institutional investors will start investing heavily in Bitcoin. If Wood's prediction proves correct and Bitcoin reaches $3.8 million by 2030, a modest investment of $1,000 today could potentially rise to over $60,000. However, there are also many analysts who are skeptical of Wood's prediction, considering it only has 5.5 years to come true.

How These Solana Meme Coin Traders Turned $6,400 Into $8 Million In 24 Hours | Bitcoinist.com


								Despite the current market downtrend, crypto traders are still finding ways to make life-changing gains. This is the case of some Solana meme coin traders who recently turned $6,400 into $8 million in 24 hours. 
How These Solana Meme Coin Traders Turned $6,400 Into $8 Million
On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) that these traders turned $6,400 into $8 million by investing in $TIM, a meme coin on Solana. 2 newly created wallets were said to have used 44.78 to buy 526.6 million $TIM (52.665 of the token’s total supply) within three minutes of launch.

These wallets then transferred their $TIM holdings (now worth around $8.28 million) to multiple addresses to avoid drawing attention. On-chain data shows that they are already looking to secure their profits, as they have been selling their $TIM tokens, although in small bits, to avoid a market crash. 

Source: Etherscan
Meme coins (especially ones on Solana) have continued to provide traders with significant gains, especially with Bitcoin and other major cap cryptocurrencies maintaining a downward trend. Bitcoinist previously reported of a trader who turned $1,800 into $11 million with Dogwifhat (WIF) by getting in early on the meme coin while it was still a micro-cap token. 
Meanwhile, more recently, pseudonymous crypto trader Larp von Trier was reported to have turned $353 into $8.3 million by investing in $KEYCAT, a meme coin on Base. The layer-2 network (like Solana) has witnessed an influx of meme coin traders thanks to the barrage of meme coins that continue to launch on the network daily.  
More Recent Success Stories
Lookonchain also recently revealed a trader who turned $9,770 into $10 million in just a day. The trader spent 64.5 SOL to buy 97.36 million $GUMMY (another Solana-based meme coin) in the “same block where the $GUMMY deployer added liquidity.” Another trader turned $110,000 into 48.72 million in just 3 hours by buying $MANEKI.

Although this trader wasn’t the first to buy the meme coin, he used $716 SOL to acquire 1.02 billion $MANEKI (11.51% of the token’s supply) less than one minute after the token launched. Like the $TIM traders, he distributed these $MANEKI tokens across different wallets to avoid drawing attention. 
Meanwhile, it is worth noting that there is an ugly side to meme coin trading, as some traders have also recorded significant losses. One is a trader who recently spent 1,600 SOL to buy $COOL and ended up selling the meme coin for 532.58 SOL, losing 1,067.42 ($152,000) in the process.

States’ backlash against Binance.US continues with 6th license pulled

Oregon has become the sixth state to revoke, suspend or decline to renew Binance.US’ license to operate there, following a spate of refusals earlier this year. The Oregon Division of Financial Regulation announced on April 30 that it had revoked Binance.US’s license, as a result of which it is prohibited from accepting money for transmission or holding or selling fiat or crypto for Oregon consumers. The division explained in a statement:“Due to the nature of the felonies committed by [former Binance CEO Changpeng] Zhao, the Division has revoked Binance.US's money transmission license.”Oregon was following the example of five states that moved against the exchange after Zhao pleaded guilty to violating Anti-Money Laundering laws. Florida was the first state to act, suspending Binance.US’ license in November, shortly after Zhao’s guilty plea. Alaska followed suit at the beginning of January when it declined to renew its license.Related: Former NY Fed chief joins Binance.US boardNorth Carolina suspended Binance.US’ license on January 23, and Maine declined to renew its license on January 29. According to a local press report, Connecticut suspended Binance.US’ license on April 24. Binance.US never received licenses in New York, Texas, Vermont and Hawaii.According to one page on the Binance.US website, its services are unavailable in Georgia and Ohio as well, although another page indicates that the exchange has licenses there. Binance opened a regional hub in Georgia with a staff of 25 in March 2023. Its license in Minnesota does not cover the exchange or transmission of virtual currency. Source: Binance.US Customer SupportThat is not the full extent of Binance.US’ troubles. Binance.US chief operating officer Christopher Blodgett said in a court deposition in December that the exchange had taken a “near-mortal blow,” forcing it to lay off over 200 staff members, due to U.S. banks’ unwillingness to work with it.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance in June. In that suit, the SEC claimed that Binance.US had failed to register as an exchange, broker and clearing agency. It further alleged that Binance.US lacked controls over “manipulative trading,” engaged in wash trading and had commingled funds with Binance, which created Binance.US in 2019 under regulatory pressure.Magazine: US and China try to crush Binance, SBF’s $40M bribe claim: Asia Express

Bitcoin traders set $50K price target after BTC falls below key support level

Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped 5.42% over the last 24 hours to hit a new multi-week low at $57,151 on May 1. On-chain data shows that a slowdown in Bitcoin demand growth and increased open short positions may be responsible for the latest drawdown, and it’s possible that new lows will be in store for BTC.BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewReporting from CryptoQuant attributes BTC’s latest decline to a slowdown in demand characterized by decreased growth in Bitcoin balances among permanent holders, slowing spot Bitcoin ETF demand and an increase in short positions in the futures market.CryptoQuant data shows that demand from permanent holders (investors who only purchase Bitcoin and never sell) fell by 50% in April, from over 200,000 BTC in late March to about 90,000 BTC. “Accelerating demand growth is needed for prices to bottom and eventually rally significantly.”Bitcoin demand from accumulated addresses. Source: CryptoQuantThe chart above reveals that this metric has “reached levels similar to early March when Bitcoin also experienced a meaningful correction,” dropping 7% immediately after breaching its all-time highs. Demand from whales has been declining since late March,, and according to CryptoQuant analysts, BTC price corrections are usually driven by slower growth in demand from large investors.“Bitcoin whale demand growth (purple area) peaked at a monthly growth rate of 12% in late March and has now slowed down to 6%.”Monthly change in total Bitcoin whale holdings. Source: CryptoQuantThe analysts also said that the slowdown in Bitcoin demand was evinced by declining purchases from spot ETFs in the U.S., which also added to the sell-side pressure.“The daily purchase of Bitcoin from ETFs has plummeted to basically zero currently, after peaking in mid-March at more than $1 billion,” noted the report, adding that "a new wave of Bitcoin purchases from ETFs is needed to refresh demand growth.”Another metric that the on-chain data analytics firm used to explain the slowdown in Bitcoin demand was the “traders’ unwillingness to pay more to open long positions” as sell orders outpace buy orders. Bitcoin funding rates. Source: CryptoQuantBitcoin’s funding rate has dropped to a year-to-date low, indicating traders’ unwillingness to “pay as much as before to open long positions.”Instead, “the recent price decline has been caused by traders opening short positions, expecting prices to decline further,” the report noted.Analysts agree that downside is the likely direction for Bitcoin priceThe ongoing market correction has left market participants wondering how low Bitcoin price can go before a trend reversal occurs. CryptoQuant analysts set the lower target within the $55,000 to $57,000 demand zone, which is “10% below the current cost basis of traders of $63,000.” Traders’ cost basis has been known to offer support for prices during bull markets.“The current Bitcoin price is already below traders’ cost basis.”Bitcoin STH realized profit/loss. Source: CryptoQuantFor popular analyst Scott Melker, $52,000 is as low as the BTC price can go in the short term. Melker said the correction is still mild for a bull market since the daily RSI is not yet oversold.“This is still only a 23% correction, very shallow for a bull market and consistent with other corrections on this run. We are yet to see a 30-40% pull back during this bull market, like those of the past.”Continuing, Tuur Demeester, a Bitcoin analyst, spotted BTC trading at $60,409, saying $50,000 could be the next stop for Bitcoin now that the $60,000 support was lost. Source: Tuur DemeesterTrader and analyst Mags said that if Bitcoin closes below $60,000 on the weekly timeframe, traders should “expect a much deeper retracement, till $40,000 and even lower.”“In this cycle so far, we have seen 4 pullbacks between 20-22%. If we witness something similar, a -22% correction from the local high would put us at $58,000 - $57,500.”This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Coinbase Q1 Earnings Preview: Analysts Say Exchange 'Key Beneficiary Of Crypto Economy' Thanks To Bitcoin ETFs - Coinbase Glb (NASDAQ:COIN) - Benzinga

Cryptocurrency company Coinbase Global COIN will report first-quarter (Q1) financial results after market close on Thursday, May 2, 2024.Read on for earnings estimates, analyst ratings, price targets and the key items to watch:Ratings & Targets:
HC Wainwright: Buy rating, raised price target from $250 to $300



JPMorgan: Neutral rating, $150 price target 



Bernstein: Market Perform rating, raised price target from $80 to $200



Compass Point: Buy rating, raised price target from $235 to $325

Bank of America: Underperform rating, raised price target from $92 to $110
Earnings Estimates: Analysts expect Coinbase to report first-quarter revenue of $1.34 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro.The company reported revenue of $772.53 million in last year's first quarter. Coinbase has beaten revenue estimates from analysts in five straight quarters.Analysts expect the company to report earnings per share of $1.00 for the first quarter, compared to a loss of 34 cents in last year's first quarter. Coinbase has beaten earnings per share estimates in four of the last five quarter, including four consecutive quarters.The company has not guided for revenue estimates but said previously it expects first-quarter subscription and services revenue to be in a range of $410 million to $480 million.Related Link: EXCLUSIVE – Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High – Here’s When Benzinga Readers Think $100K Milestone Could Be ReachedWhat Analysts Say: The first quarter was an "eventful quarter for the cryptoecosystem," JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington said.The analyst said Coinbase could be a key beneficiary of the increased trading activity.Worthington expects Coinbase to post subscription and services revenue of $450 million. The analyst also sees Base, which is Coinbase's Layer 2 platform, contributing more meaningful in the quarter at around $20 million in net revenue."We see Coinbase as both a leading driver and beneficiary of the cryptocurrency economy, and we previously underestimated the strength of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in its early days – launched January 2024 – as a key catalyst for the crypto industry," Worthington said.The analyst said Coinbase's revenue generation could benefit in the short term with a crypto rally."We see the longer term success of Coinbase being driven by development, with our focus on tokenization and payments."Key Items to Watch: When Coinbase reported fourth-quarter financial results, the company said its three main priorities for 2024 would be driving revenue through improving core trading, driving utility in crypto with experiments in payments and driving regulatory clarity for the industry.Investors and analysts will watch for all of these items in the upcoming quarterly report.The biggest item likely watched by those looking at Coinbase will be the impact the approval and launch of Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs had on the company in the first quarter.Investors will also be looking to see how big of an impact on trading volume and transaction revenues Bitcoin had compared to other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin represented 31% of trading volume and 29% of transaction revenues in the fourth quarter.The balance of transaction revenue with the company's subscription and services revenue could also be something to monitor. The transaction revenue is larger but can also be more volatile from quarter to quarter, while the subscription and services revenue is growing and also important for the company increasing efforts for profitability.COIN Price Action: Coinbase shares were up 3% to $210.09 on Wednesday versus a 52-week trading range of $46.43 to $283.48.Read Next: Coinbase Up 300% In A Year, But Faces Bearish Technicals Ahead Of Q1 EarningsImage: Shutterstock

                        Wednesday, May 01, 2024 – An ongoing presale for Solana’s greatest multichain good boy Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) has taken in $13 million so far, with at least $2 million flooding into the ICO in the five days since it deployed on Solana.Crypto’s latest Shiba Inu-inspired funny token has pricked the ears of meme fans, degens and crypto evangelists alike, who see Dogeverse’s hyper-jumping cross-chain capabilities as a hint of tomorrow’s meme coin capabilities.Now SOL fans are in on the action too. As of Friday, April 26, Dogeverse has rolled out on its sixth native chain, Solana, joining a digital economy that is home to $3.465 billion in total value locked (TVL), with 1.13 million active users transacting daily and over 2,500 monthly active developers.Since Dogeverse exists on multiple chains, it can be purchased by anyone on Ethereum ($ETH), BNB Smart Chain ($BNB), Polygon ($MATIC), Avalanche ($AVAX), Base ($BASE) and now Solana ($SOL) to spare.To purchase with SOL, simply head to the website and select “Buy With SOL” from the drop-down menu of the buy widget. Doing so will transport users to a Solana-based version of the site hosted on solana.thedogeverse.com.The option to pay with Solana is hosted on a subdomain, due to wallet connect functions not being able to support Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solana-integrated wallets in tandem.The SOL-specific version of the Dogeverse website also adds the ability to buy tokens using Circle’s hugely popular USDC, which is the stablecoin of choice on the Solana network,The Dogeverse ICO and Beyond
Currently priced at $0.000304 and due to rise in a few days, Dogeverse sold out its initial soft cap allocation of 200 billion tokens after trending virally on launching at the beginning of April.A heady $1 million flooded the project barely 48 hours into its ICO, selling out of tokens allocated to the first two presale rounds and far exceeding the team’s initial expectation of a 6-day first round.This enabled Dogeverse to move onto the second half of its ICO a day ahead of schedule. A further 200 billion tokens are being sold to the public across the remaining rounds before the presale closes. Initially, this was planned for June 11, however, due to the immense success of the presale, it’s likely to conclude substantially earlier.The funds from these additional tokens, which would otherwise be sold on decentralized (DEX) or centralized (CEX) exchanges after the claim, will now be used to bolster liquidity to ensure high-volume trading and for buy-back funds.Token holders can stake on Ethereum to earn passive rewards.The team is currently working towards CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap listing applications, while later DEX and CEX listings form part of the project roadmap.Cosmo: Crypto’s New Hyper-Jumping Multi-Chain Good Boy
The market’s appetite for canine-themed coins began with Dogecoin (DOGE) back at the end of 2013. Dogecoin didn’t need much of a sales pitch, because it was based on a viral meme that virtually anyone with a social media account had seen before. (Wow! Such meme! Very crypto!)Since then, many celebrities have professed their love for the novelty canine cryptocurrency, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, American entrepreneur Mark Cuban, and musicians Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg.But fun as it may be, Dogecoin is not without its problems.Since Dogecoin is its own proprietary network based on Bitcoin, it utilizes a consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Work (PoW) to validate transactions. This means that the miners with the most computation and power mine the most Dogecoin. Like Bitcoin, mining DOGE consumes a lot of energy.Doge was followed by Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Bonk (BONK), and DogWifHat (WIF). All of them reference original viral doge memes in some way, but all of them have either come from the most commercially important blockchain, Ethereum, or its nearest rival, Solana, both of which use less energy than Bitcoin and Dogecoin.To date, none of the alternative Dogecoins have seriously challenged the original’s dominance.Dogeverse hopes to change that. It is built on a multichain network spanning six chains, none of which deploy the PoW consensus mechanism.At the center of the Dogeverse is our four-legged friend Cosmo. Born from a supernova, Cosmo discovered he had a unique ability: the power to hyper-jump across universes.Now, Cosmo wants to share the chain-leaping fun with his owners.Dogeverse and the Ethereum ETF Saga
Analysts are anticipating potentially price-driving news this month, on May 23. That’s the SEC’s first deadline to respond to the latest round of applications for US spot Ethereum ETFs.The date could mark the start of a potential Ethereum gold rush, and with Ethereum being crypto’s most commercially important blockchain, the whole ecosystem will benefit.So will Layer 1 competitors like Solana and Avalanche and Layer 2s like Polygon, all of which are native to the Dogeverse.Given the fact that a federal court overturned the SEC’s earlier refusal of Bitcoin ETFs as “arbitrary and capricious” it’s possible that spot Ethereum ETFs will pass through unopposed, smashing the doors down for the approval of similar products for Solana and Avalanche.VIDEOThe ETF effect is a very real catalyst, too. Earlier this year, the US launch of eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs rallied the original cryptocurrency to set a new high watermark of $73,737.94 on March 14.So Cosmo is a clean and green representative of not one, not two, but six different blockchain networks. And with staking capabilities, seamless multi-chain fun and a potentially catalytic news cycle in the coming months, what’s not to love about crypto’s new hyper-jumping pupper?Join the presale over on the Dogeverse website before the price rises.Social Channels: Twitter | Telegram

                        Wednesday, May 01, 2024 – Crypto’s latest cybernetic sausage dog sensation, AI meme coin WienerAI ($WAI), has added the most advanced beginner-friendly trading bot in crypto to its ecosystem in an ICO that has already attracted over $700,000 in three weeks.The team is touting its new AI companion as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner” with user-friendly AI-enhanced trading, seamless swap functionality and zero fees. With unparalleled capabilities, WienerAI is the ultimate asset for every crypto trader.It couldn’t be easier to get an edge, thanks to WienerAI. Just ask the bot a question relating to whatever your crypto investment needs are, and WienerAI will use its predictive technology to scour the markets to sniff out a winner for his owners, providing them with a breakdown of his logic and analysis.Wiener’s swap feature allows his users to make fast, efficient token swaps and in a few clicks find the best prices available on DEXs.It also has a reflexive edge over frontrunners, like MEV bots. These bots frontrun traders’ transactions in order to profit from minimizing their gains. WienerAI’s cybernetic capabilities get him in front of every frontrunner.WienerAI recalls another successful recent token launch, canine meme coin and AI security token Scotty the AI ($SCOTTY), which netted close to $10 million in a recent presale.Combining two hot niches, both $WAI and $SCOTTY have inspired investors with the promise of a new generation of coins that offer more laughs than run-of-the-mill AI coins and more utility than bog standard meme coins.Other strong narratives driving the project are its eye-watering staking rewards, currently offering yields of 1241% per annum, its verified audit, and the fun, community-building storyline.WienerAI: The Only Sausage/Dog/AI Hybrid
To begin with, investors have probably never heard an origin story like this before. Like his predecessor, Scotty the AI, WienerAI arrives on the scene with a fully-formed backstory.Wiener was born in a lab in New Silicon Valley, AD 2132. His progenitor is a mad puppy-loving scientist known as The Architect, whose life’s work was to create an advanced AI/canine hybrid.Indeed, he succeeded, albeit with one caveat. The Architect was eating a sausage as he was performing the splicing procedure. The accidental result was WienerAI, a hybrid of pup, AI and sausage.Now, the whitepaper mentions “companionship” and “friendship” as key parts of Wiener’s premise. It also mentions “The Sausage Army”, the endearing term for the legions of followers Wiener hopes to attract, so there are subtle hints at a strong social component.He’s not the first crypto doge with an army, but he may be the best.WienerAI Wants To Take Over Crypto’s Doge Scene
The world’s first and favorite meme coin, Dogecoin ($DOGE), also has an army: the self-styled “Doge Army”, but Wiener is aiming for a wider community and he has a decent battle cry to help him rally his sausage forces.See, Dogecoin is one tired pupper. Launched in 2013, Dogecoin is housed on its own blockchain, which is a spin on Bitcoin’s. Dogecoin employs a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which means that it’s the miners with access to the most power and/or computation that bag the most DOGE.In a world of rising atmospheric temperatures and international climate targets, PoW is a growing concern among more conscientious investors.WienerAI’s native chain, Ethereum, employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where the miners that stake the most ETH get the most rewards. This is well over 99% more energy efficient than Bitcoin and Dogecoin.Secondly, in an industry that was rocked by near-constant scandals and liquidity crises in the last two years, WienerAI offers the security of proper auditing. The WienerAI smart contract was audited by Coinsult, a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms. This gives investors added confidence in WienerAI.Lastly, there’s the daily staking rewards. Some 20% of $WAI’s supply is earmarked for staking. Buyers can stake during the presale, and are in fact encouraged to do so on the website, in order to take advantage of the lucrative 1241% APY on offer at present.Mysterious he may be, but it’s no mystery why investors are piling into WienerAI’s new presale. Everybody wants to get their hands on a tokenized piece of crypto’s most advanced beginner-friendly AI trading companion yet.Keep on top of WienerAI’s latest developments on X/Twitter and Telegram.Join the presale now over on the website.

Bitcoin Traders Target Test of $53,000 Support as BTC Price Predictions Remains Bearish Following Fed Meeting
                        The Bitcoin (BTC) price is consolidating in the mid-$57,000s, down roughly 5% on the day, though up around 1.5% or $1,000 from earlier session lows as traders weigh the outlook for Fed rate cuts this year in wake of the latest policy announcement from the US central bank.As anticipated, the Fed left interest rates at multi-decade high levels of 5.25-5.5% and slowed its balance sheet run-off.The central bank will now allow its portfolio of assets to shrink by only $25 billion per month. Before, the central bank had been allowing its balance sheet to shrink by $60 billion per month.That reduction was a little larger than some investors appeared to anticipate and could explain the dovish market reaction to the initial policy announcement.Bitcoin briefly pushed all the way to the mid-$59,000s, and US stocks pumped, though these moves quickly reversed.Currently, Bitcoin is trading hands roughly in line with where it was before the Fed’s announcement.As expected, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted recent higher-than-expected inflation data readings so far this year.He commented that gaining confidence to cut interest rates will take longer than expected.According to CME data, the money market-implied odds that the Fed will have cut interest rates by 25 bps by September rose to 54% from 46% one day ago.Meanwhile, the probability of no rate cuts this year dropped to 16% from 27% one day ago.Ultimately, the market interpreted the Fed meeting as slightly more dovish than expected, explaining the Bitcoin price bounce from lows.Where Next for the Bitcoin Price?
While Bitcoin may have recovered from earlier session lows, recent technical developments suggest more downside is coming.Prior to Wednesday’s Fed meeting, Bitcoin had dropped nearly 5% from just below $61,000.That drop came after it fell 5% from near $65,000 on Tuesday.The decrease from earlier weekly highs comes as US economic data points to sticky inflation pressures and accelerated ETF outflows.According to data presented by The Block, US Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows for five days straight.The drop in Bitcoin prices from earlier weekly highs comes as US economic data points to sticky inflation pressures and as ETF outflows accelerate. Source: The BlockImportantly, Wednesday’s dip saw Bitcoin break to the south of its two-month $60,000-$74,000ish range.The next major level of support for Bitcoin isn’t until the mid-February highs at $53,000.The next major level of support for the Bitcoin price isn’t until the mid-February highs at $53,000. Source: TradingViewMany analysts are now predicting that BTC will hit the low $50,000s.A few analysts mentioned that the average entry price of US Bitcoin ETF buyers at $57,300 is important to watch.“There might have been lots of ‘TradFi’ tourists in crypto pushing longs into the halving,” 10x CEO Markus Thielen wrote.  “This time is now over. We expect more unwinding as… Bitcoin trades below $57,300. This will likely lower prices to… a -25% to -29% correction from the $73,000 top. That explains our price target of $52,000/$55,000 during the last three weeks.”

SEC to OK Leveraged ETH ETFs... While Probing Security Status? - DailyCoin


        
The SEC may be set to approve leveraged ETH futures ETFs.



The likely approval comes despite an ongoing investigation into whether Ethereum is an unregistered security.



At the same time, the SEC continues to delay a decision on spot Ethereum ETFs.
The debacle over the SEC’s classification of Ethereum is getting more complicated.Over the past few weeks, it has become clear that the regulator has the second largest crypto asset in terms of market cap in its cross-hairs, suspecting that the asset may be an unregistered security. For the observers, the situation recently got more complicated as a recent ConsenSys complaint revealed that the SEC’s Ethereum probe has been on for at least a year, months before the agency implicitly signed off on the CFTC’s classification of ETH as a commodity by approving ETH futures ETFs.Adding to the growing confusion over the SEC’s stance, the agency now looks set to approve leveraged ETH ETF products.Leveraged ETH Futures ETF Applicants Feeling “Optimistic”On Wednesday, May 1, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that leveraged ETH futures ETF applicants felt “optimistic” about their chances of getting approval, citing persons familiar with the matter. The journalist disclosed that these institutions expressed this view based on “positive dialogue” from the SEC. If the SEC gives the green light as they expect, Volatility Shares’ 2x Ether Strategy ETF (ETHU) will be the first to go live on June 4.  As Terrett highlighted, approving these products will add another layer of intrigue to the Ethereum security status debacle.By approving leveraged ETH futures ETFs, the SEC will be stirring further confusion by again implicitly accepting the CFTC’s classification of the crypto asset while having a pending investigation into whether it is a security.
Stressing the potential implications of the move, Van Buren Capital General Partner Scott Johnsson asserted that the SEC’s decision on the matter would be “key to watch.”Beyond the apparent inconsistencies in the regulator’s actions, from a risk perspective, most could not wrap their head around the logic of approving leveraged ETH futures ETFs while delaying spot ETFs.“Make It Make Sense”For months, the SEC has delayed its decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications, offering no reason for the delay except that it required more time to review applications. With the May 23 deadline for the agency to decide on VanEck’s application looming, the growing consensus among observers and even some applicants is that this application will be denied.The possibility of the SEC first approving leveraged futures ETFs, which arguably pose greater investment risks over spot offerings, has rubbed many off as odd, to say the least.Angel Investor Eric Conner sarcastically quipped, “Make so much sense… Much protection!”Chiming in, The ETF Store, Inc. President Nate Geraci added, “Somebody make it make sense.”On the Flipside 
The SEC has yet to approve the leveraged ETH futures ETFs officially.



It will not be the first time the SEC approved leveraged futures ETFs before the spot. The agency had approved leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs about six months before finally approving the spot product.
Why This MattersThe likely approval of leveraged ETH futures ETFs adds further confusion to the uncertainty surrounding the agency’s classification of Ethereum.Read this for more on the Ethereum security classification debacle:How Year-Long ETH Security Probe Paints SEC into a CornerLearn about Polygon’s (MATIC) recent price action:Polygon (MATIC) Plunges in BTC-Led Flush: Can It Hold Support?

Altcoins In Trouble As Seasoned Analyst Predicts 40% Drop In Prices


                            Altcoins have suffered more in the crypto market following the Bitcoin price crash, leaving a lot of investors in losses. This is not out of the ordinary as these altcoins are known to have a higher volatility compared to Bitcoin, hence, their price swings can be more pronounced. Given the recent decline, the expectation is that the altcoins will recover. However, one analyst does not agree with that assessment.
Altcoins Headed For 40% Crash
In an analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), seasoned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen shocked the crypto community with his expectations for altcoins. According to the analysis, the worst is far from over for the altcoin market, as there are still more crashes to come.

Cowen explained that this was analyzed using altcoins versus Bitcoin pairs, and it seems each one looks weak against the apex cryptocurrency. This is due to the expected rate cuts, and historical performance suggests that a decline will follow.
The crypto analyst pointed to the 2019 rate cuts and how altcoins had reacted to that development back then. Following the rate cuts, altcoins plunged against Bitcoin, with major players recording up to 40% losses during this time. “Perhaps this time is not different? This would mean ALT/BTC pairs drop another 40% from here over the next few months,” Cowen said.
Cowen expects this to place out regardless of what happens in the market in the meantime. He explains that even if the market does recover in the short term, it does not invalidate the thesis. “Short-term countertrends do not invalidate this view,” he stated.
If this repeats, then it could turn an already harsh market trend even bloodier. The altcoin market cap has already fallen below $1 trillion as of the time of writing, but a 40% decline from here could send it as low as $600 billion.
Bitcoin Crash Drags Down Crypto Market
While the Bitcoin crash has been brutal, the impact on altcoins has been much more pronounced. Ethereum has held up nicely with less than a 4% decline during this time, but others such as Stacks (STX), Arweave (AR), Neo (NEO), and Sei (SEI) are down an average of 9% in the last 24 hours.

Meme coins were also not left out of the bloodbath, with market leader Dogecoin dropping 6% to $0.126 and Pepe (PEPE) plunging 7.74% to $0.0000063. Bonk (BONK) recorded a 5% decline to eliminate some of its gains from last week, and Shiba Inu fell 4.18%.
Amid all of this, though, there have been some market winners, with Optimism (OP) recording 12% gains. Cosmos (ATOM) followed with a 9.8% increase, and Starknet (STRK) rose 9%, making them the top gainers of the day, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

Four Solana Memecoins That Could Rally Over 8,000% and Take on Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Is Chainlink (LINK) Set for a Another Price Dip?


Chainlink (LINK) is currently facing bearish woes and could react to them by noting a price drop. This is essential for the altcoin to initiate a recovery that could help gain the losses noted recently.
Investors are exhibiting short-term pessimism, which aligns with the predicted outcome for the LINK price.
Chainlink Investors Could Make a Move Soon
LINK price is anticipating a decline, and the network is not keen on changing the outcome. The recent correction eliminated any incentive for new investors to jump aboard the Chainlink train. This is evident in the network growth, which has dipped to a yearly low. 
Network growth is calculated based on the rate at which new addresses are formed on the network. This data determines whether or not a project is losing traction in the market.

Given Chainlink’s network growth is so low, it seems probable that LINK is not attracting any new users at the moment. This could negatively impact the price of the token.

Secondly, LINK is highly undervalued at the moment, based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This, however, is a bullish development. 
The MVRV ratio measures investor profit/loss. Chainlink’s 30-day MVRV at -16% signals losses, potentially prompting accumulation. 
Historically, LINK price recovery occurs at -7% and -17% MVRV, labeling it an opportunity zone. Nevertheless, there is still some room before LINK investors purchase the token right now to initiate a recovery.

LINK Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch
LINK price, trading at $12.7 at the time of writing, is below the support of $13.2. This is a crucial level because it coincides with the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement.
Further decline is likely should LINK fall below the support at $12.7. Considering the market conditions, LINK will potentially drop to $11.7 before bouncing back up.

However, if the support at $12.7 remains intact and Chainlink reclaims 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement as support, it could initiate a recovery. This would invalidate the bearish thesis and enable a rise to $14.8 and beyond.

Is BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Suppressing the Price? | EP 981 - YouTube

Dogecoin Enters Major Accumulation Zone, Is It Time To Get Back In? | Bitcoinist.com


								The foremost meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE), has entered a major accumulation zone, suggesting that this may be the right time to invest in the crypto token. This is also supported by the fact that the meme coin could soon experience a trend reversal from the current downtrend that it is experiencing. 
Dogecoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio Is A Buy Signal
Data from the market intelligence platform Santiment shows that Dogecoin’s 30-day MVRV ratio is around -15%, meaning many Dogecoin holders are currently at a loss. This negative MVRV ratio also signals a bottom for the meme coin, which usually ushers in a period of accumulation since the crypto token is currently undervalued. 
Related Reading: Cardano Roars Back To Life As ADA Whales Move $13.84 Billion
Besides new investors, Dogecoin’s current holders are also expected to use this opportunity to accumulate more of the meme coin in a bid to break even in their positions. This already looks to be happening, as data from IntoTheBlock shows a notable increase in the token supply held by long-term holders (more than a year).
Crypto investors buying up the Dogecoin dip can add significant buying pressure to the crypto token, which could spark a price recovery amidst this market downtrend. Moreover, on-chain data shows that Dogecoin whales are also accumulating during this period. Specifically, 150,000,000 DOGE were transferred from the crypto trading platform Robinhood to an unknown wallet, while another 76,316,694 DOGE were transferred from Robinhood to that wallet. 
These whales have a massive influence on the market, and their buys could positively impact DOGE’s price. Meanwhile, it is also worth noting that this price recovery looks imminent for DOGE, considering that recovery has historically always occurred around this MVRV range. 
What DOGE Chart Is Saying
Crypto analyst Kevin (formerly OG Yomi) recently stated that Dogecoin is currently at a “major support zone, one which he believes that the meme coin shouldn’t lose if the crypto market is indeed in a “real bull market.” The analyst mentioned in an earlier X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin needs to hold above this level to remain bullish.  

Source: X
However, Dogecoin risks dropping below that level, especially with the current market-wide downtrend with Bitcoin leading the charge. Moreover, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to announce the rate decision on May 1, which could cause DOGE and other crypto tokens to decline further if they decide to take a hawkish stance and increase interest rates.

At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.123, down over 10% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

MicroStrategy Is Building ‘Decentralized ID’ on Bitcoin Using Ordinals-Like Inscriptions - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsDuring a presentation at the annual MicroStrategy World conference in Las Vegas, MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor unveiled the open-source MicroStrategy Orange Decentralized Identity protocol.“Michael presented a very compelling case for why we need decentralized identity and did decentralized identifiers,” MicroStrategy executive vice president of engineering Cezary Raczko told the audience. “He made an even more compelling case why it makes sense to anchor digital identity into the Bitcoin blockchain, protected by the strength and the security of the Bitcoin network.”Alongside the announcement, MicroStrategy published an unofficial draft of the MicroStrategy Orange specification to Github.While the timing of the news was unexpected, Saylor previously hinted that his company was working in the identity and authentication space. He told Decrypt last year that MicroStrategy was more than aware of Ordinals after the protocol launched in January, and interested in exploring how it could inspire software innovations.“The whole idea of burning a piece of data on the blockchain opens the door to the possibility that I might burn a digital signature, or I might burn a registration, or I might burn a hash of a document,” Saylor said. “Right now, enterprises have weak security compared to Bitcoin.”The Bitcoin advocate said that innovations using the world's largest cryptocurrency could introduce an entirely new level of security.“The platform consists of three fundamental pieces, Raczko said late Wednesday.“At the heart of it is a service cloud, hosted, that allows you to issue those identifiers to your users in your organization,” he explained. “It also allows you to deploy prepackaged out-of-the-box applications that run on the MicroStrategy Orange platform.”Raczko said the Orange software development kit will make it easy for coders to take these capabilities and integrate them into their own applications and systems.Using email as an example, Raczko said Bitcoin-based public and private keys generated using MicroStrategy Orange would be inscribed using the Ordinals protocol.According to the MicroStrategy Orange documentation, the decentralized identity protocol uses a modified approach to inscriptions as Ordinals, but stores only data related to decentralized identity (DID), meaning documents can be created and updated with few restrictions on size and content while taking advantage of the segregated witness (SegWit) feature of Bitcoin.“Once you've established that that email is genuine, you accept the invitation, and at that point, we're going to generate your unique decentralized identifier, and the public and private key pair,” Raczko explained. “We're going to send a decentralized identifier and the public key to the Orange server to be inscribed on the Bitcoin Blockchain, [and] from that point onward, you are ready to start sending Orange-signed or emails.”“[The] opportunity we see and want to pursue is integrating the digital identity based on Bitcoin with this bigger, verifiable credential ecosystem which opens up another large number of very interesting use cases where I can now credential my identity anchored to Bitcoin,” Raczko said.He added that the MicroStrategy Orange decentralized identifier could also be used to verify users on social media applications or authenticate a text message, college degree or medical record.“Present those and then have those verified all in a decentralized way, but with the ultimate identity living and being anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain,” Raczko added—suggesting that Orange could make it possible to display an “orange check” for verified users across platforms.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms reports record $211M Q1 net income

Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm Riot Platforms reported a $211.8 million net income for Q1 2024 — a company record and a 1,000% increase from the same time last year — but missed analyst revenue estimates.Riot’s first quarter results released May 1 show minin revenue spiked 55.4% year-on-year to $74.6 million, primarily driven by a 131% increase in Bitcoin’s price.The firm's total revenue was $79.3 million, fallin 14% short of estimates by research firm Zacks.The miner said a rise in net income and mining revenue was partially slowed by lower Bitcoin production and higher mining costs due to an increase in Bitcoin’s network difficulty and hash rate.Riot’s unaudited financial statement for Q1 2024. Source: Riot PlatformsRiot mined 1,364 BTC during Q1, a 36% decrease from 2023’s first quarter. Its average cost to mine 1 BTC was $23,000 — 144% more expensive compared to the same time last year which Riot said was “primarily driven by an increase of 89% in global network hash rate.”Riot announced a new facility in Corsicana, Texas last month which CEO Jason Les believes will become the largest dedicated Bitcoin mining facility in the world once fully developed.Related: Jack Dorsey’s Block announces development of ‘full Bitcoin mining system’The mining firm claimed it was on track to increase its hash rate capacity from 12.4 exahashes per second (EH/s) to 31 EH/s before the end of the year.

CZ’s Trial Proves it Pays to Cooperate

This is the plain and simple understanding drawn from comparing CZ to Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and fraudster behind rival exchange FTX, who, in March, was sentenced to 25 years in prison, and never really admitted to his multi-billion dollar theft of client funds. CZ, of course, wasn’t accused of stealing from customers, but instead of failing to implement the necessary compliance infrastructure expected of a money transmitter.

Solana Co-Founder Says Cosmos and One SOL Rival Are Clear Winners in Building Sovereign Blockchains - The Daily Hodl


								Solana (SOL) co-founder Raj Gokal is naming two blockchains that have a head start in the sovereign blockchains crypto sub-sector.
At a TOKEN2049 panel discussion, Gokal says that Avalanche (AVAX) and Cosmos Hub (ATOM) are “the clear winners” with regard to sovereign blockchains.










A sovereign blockchain is typically under the control of a single entity, unlike public blockchains such as Bitcoin (BTC) which are decentralized.
According to Gokal, Cosmos Hub and Avalanche have some differences that set them apart.
“Cosmos is an old-school project and it’s not that coordinated. I think Avalanche brings the coordination and the ability for developers to configure their own chains how they want. So I like that about their design. And obviously, it’s a function of Emi’s [Gün Sirer] DNA and his great vision as a founder.”
On the Avalanche founder Emin Gün Sirer, Gokal further says,
“I think Solana loves competition. We love fierce competition, we love honest competition from people who have ferocity about the ideas they’re bringing to the table. 
And I think Emin is probably the most ferocious layer-1 [blockchain] founder that I know. And he never backs down from a fight. But he will shake your hand behind the stage and he’s friends with everyone. And he’s been very supportive of a lot of founders. 
So I think as an individual I have a lot of respect for Emin and what he’s brought to the space.”

'Bitcoin Jesus' arrest raises concerns: 'The U.S. is coming after crypto!' - AMBCrypto



After Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao, Roger Ver is under the radar of the U.S. government. 
Diverse reactions within the crypto community highlight industry complexities amid legal actions.

The year 2024 is proving to be a golden age for cryptocurrencies, with the exponential growth of this asset class coinciding with a surge in crypto voters. 
Notably, a significant portion of this surge in crypto adoption occurred after the 2020 presidential election. Following Biden’s election, there was an unprecedented wave of retail adoption within the cryptocurrency industry.
However, as the U.S. elections 2024 approaches, an unexpected development has emerged. 
The United States Department of Justice has announced charges against Roger Ver, also known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” on allegations of tax evasion.
Diverging perspective 
Various execs have weighed in on the matter, speculating that it is an anti-crypto stance within the Biden administration.
Highlighting consecutive arrests by the U.S. government, including Sam Bankman-Fried, Changpeng Zhao, and now Roger Ver, David Shares, a crypto expert noted, 
“The U.S. is aggressively coming after crypto. Just look at the recent targets. If you think you’re not a target, think again. They will come after all of us at some point. We have to fight!” 
Echoing similar sentiments, Jane Adams, a 2024 candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives and a supporter of Bitcoin, said,

However, some execs believed in the steps taken by the U.S. Voicing his apprehensions against Ver, Bitcoin educator, Dan Held said, 
“Good. He’s been a net negative for Bitcoin.” 
Adding to the fray, an X user, @koinosthegoat, claimed, 
Source: @koinosthegoat/Twitter
These contrasting perspectives underscore the complexities and divisions within the crypto space, suggesting potential implications for the upcoming U.S. elections.
What’s more to it? 
As a matter of fact, Ver was arrested in Spain on the 30th of April, following criminal charges in the U.S. for offenses including mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. 
The DoJ alleges that Ver avoided taxes totaling $48 million on his Bitcoin and cryptocurrency sales in 2017. According to a press release by the DoJ,
Source: U.S. Department of Justice
However, despite renouncing his US citizenship in 2014, Ver faces extradition to the United States, prompting criticism from crypto veterans and social media users. 
Amidst this criticism, Kim Dotcom, a crypto veteran who himself was in the same shoes a few years ago, remarked,
“This indictment has nothing to do with tax evasion. This is a malicious attempt to vilify Roger and to punish him for exposing and opposing the crimes of the US empire.” 
As things unfold, it will be interesting to watch how the upcoming U.S. elections will shape the future of cryptocurrency in the States.

Is Celestia (TIA) Vulnerable to a 25% Price Drop?


Celestia (TIA) is prone to further correction after consistently forming red candlesticks over the past few days. The saving grace is that investors are not too keen on saving the altcoin either.
The most likely outcome for TIA is a five-month low since it follows the cues set by Bitcoin, which dropped below $60,000.
Celestia Investors Save Their Money
Celestia’s price decline resulted from the crypto market noting a bearish couple of days in the previous month. However, the broader impact has been on the traders who have opted to withdraw from the asset for now.
This is noted in the decline in the Open Interest (OI), which in the past month has been reduced by 50%. At the start of March, a total of $233 million worth of shorts and long contracts were opened in the market. This has since come down to $113 million, less than half of the original OI.
This shows that the investors only focus on profitable actions, which could take a while.
Celesita Open Interest. Source: Coinglass
The reason behind this delay is the correlation that TIA shares with Bitcoin. A high correlation of 0.96 exhibits a tethered price action of both assets, with TIA following BTC’s cues. Currently, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is witnessing a bearish outlook, with Bitcoin’s price trading below $60,000.

Further decline in BTC is anticipated, and the condition of Celestia’s price is also the same. Thus, the altcoin could observe some drawdown in the coming days.

TIA Price Prediction: Drop to $7 
Celestia’s price is testing the support marked at $9.2, which could fail to hold, resulting in a price correction to the next area of support at $8.3. But if this level breaks, it would validate the bearish thesis, causing the TIA price to correct further and hit $7.

However, if the $8.3 support floor holds strong enough to prevent a decline, TIA could bounce back. Reclaiming the $10 would wipe out half the losses noted and invalidate the bearish thesis.

Build on Bitcoin Launches Mainnet With Over 40 Apps - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Build on Bitcoin (BOB) project announced the launch of its first phase on Wednesday, enabling decentralized apps—dapps—to interact with the world’s top blockchain.The BOB mainnet is coming online with $300 million in total value locked (TVL) and over 40 dapps already available, the team said on Twitter, declaring “a Bitcoin-driven DeFi summer” with more to come in the next three weeks.Build on Bitcoin is intended to be a hybrid layer-2 network, an “Ethereum rollup” that merges Bitcoin’s global adoption, liquidity, and proof-of-work security with the decentralized finance (DeFi) features of Ethereum: smart contracts, wallets, and access to stablecoins.In March, Bitcoin DeFi developer Sovryn used Build on Bitcoin to expand its offerings to the Ethereum ecosystem. BOB is meanwhile collaborating with Threshold’s tBTC and Wrapped BTC (WBTC).“We currently work with the two leading BTC bridge providers while working on our bridge infrastructure in parallel,” BOB co-founder Alexei Zamyatin told Decrypt. “We built a one-click onramp from Bitcoin to BOB that abstracts bridge complexity and makes moving liquidity from BTC to BOB as easy as moving from ETH to an ETH L2 going live next week.”Zamyatin said Build on Bitcoin is also looking to provide a one-stop shop for Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes, working with teams that provide bridges for Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20 tokens.Image: Build on BitcoinWhile Bitcoin DeFi is the goal, the BOB team acknowledged that the number one blockchain is not ready, making “bootstrapping” on Ethereum necessary.“Connecting to Ethereum follows a pragmatic rollout approach,” the team said. “Bitcoin rollups do not yet work, but demand is high: Bitcoin users need access to stablecoins and DeFi, Ethereum users want to use their BTC and get access to Ordinals, Runes and BRC-20s.”“It is time to end the cult-like feuds and unite the two largest Web3 ecosystems to spearhead mass adoption together,” BOB declared.According to Zamyatin, the next phase of BOB’s development will achieve Bitcoin proof of work via “merged mining,” enhancing security without disrupting Bitcoin mining. Merged mining refers to the process of mining two or more blockchains at the same time.“Previous merged mining instances suffered from slow block times (30sec-1min) due to the limitations of Proof-of-Work,” he said.Finally, the third planned phase will introduce BitVM, enabling a secure BTC bridge with fraud proofs similar to Ethereum's bridges, BOB explains, ensuring safe BTC deposits enforced by Bitcoin nodes.“This ensures that users bridging in BTC can be certain that their deposits are safe and security is enforced by all Bitcoin full nodes—as long as there is at least one person online to submit a fraud-proof,” he said, noting Arbitrum on Ethereum.To draw more users to its platform, Zamyatin pointed to a BOB fusion program that the company is using to boost adoption through dapps that increase the TVL and number of users.According to the Build on Bob website, the total value locked on the platform is currently over $279 million.“BOB Fusion Season 1 attracted 300 million in TVL from 33,000 users in 4 weeks,” Zamyatin said. “BOB Season 2 that launched today saw $64 million in on-chain TVL inflow in less than 12 hours.”“Our mission is to make BTC deployment into DeFi super easy,” Zamyatin said. “Think Yearn Finance for Bitcoin, and make Bitcoin assets accessible to Ethereum and EVM users—uniting the two largest web3 power-user ecosystems.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

                        In wake of the cryptocurrency market’s latest tumble which saw Bitcoin (BTC) drop convincingly below $60,000 for the first time since late February, traders are turning to the on-chain markets as they hunt for top crypto gainers today.Bitcoin was last trading in the $57,000s as traders digest the latest Fed policy announcement. Negative ETF flows are also on their radar, with Bitcoin ETFs having seen outflows now for five straight days.As per The Block, US ETFs have seen outflows now for five straight days.Most altcoins are also in the red. That is encouraging traders looking to turn a quick profit to turn to the volatile, unpredictable on-chain markets.On-chain markets refer to the market for assets that were issued and trade directly on the blockchain.Dozens of new tokens are launched every single day. Most are pump-and-dump schemes or scams. But there are some gems to be uncovered, that could hand an early investor quick 10 or even 100x gains.Traders often refer to tools like DEXScreener to locate trending and pumping coins.That being said, here are some of the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum, as per DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayAITaxBot (AITAX)A newly launched crypto called AITaxBot (AITAX) is up 1800% on Wednesday, as per DEXScreener.The shitcoin last had a market cap of $370,000, with $130,000 in locked liquidity, with volumes so far of $520,000.The token has four concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per Go+ Security. Investors need to be cautious.America (AMERICA)A meme coin called America (AMERICA) that was launched three days ago continues to push higher.It was last up 220% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $5.1 million as per DEXScreener. It also has a solid $260,000 in locked liquidity.The meme coin has been on a donating spree to US veterans.Donations to good causes are an interesting and commendable marketing strategy for a meme coin.That could explain why AMERICA keeps pumping. Hopefully, it sets a trend.The token has two smart contract issues, as per Go+ Security.Book of Ethereum (BOOE)A meme coin called Book of Ethereum (BOOE) challenged its record highs on Wednesday following a 50% intra-day gains.That according to DEXScreener, that puts its market cap at $3.3 million and liquidity at $270,000.BOOE has no issues with its smart contract and appears not to be a scam. That being said, investors must always do their due diligence and remember that the vast majority of newly launched coins do not retain long-term value.Alternative Investment Strategy to Consider – Presales

Argentina Lawmaker Unveils Draft Worldcoin Regulation Bill

                        An Argentinian lawmaker has launched a draft bill that proposes regulating Worldcoin and its operator in the Latin American nation.The move comes just days after Worldcoin announced a planned expansion in Mexico. Some Mexican lawmakers have also called for a probe into operator Tools for Humanity.Argentina Lawmaker: We Must Protect Consumer Rights
Per the official news outlet of the Buenos Aires assembly, the new bill is the brainchild of Buenos Aires parliament member Carlos Puglelli.The MP, and others, have claimed it is “unclear” what Worldcoin does with the biometric data it collects using its iris-scanning drives.Puglelli’s bill proposes “regulating companies that scan people’s irises for the purpose of collecting biometric data.”The bill’s author noted that Buenos Aires authorities should be allowed to “exercise control over activities carried out by companies like Worldcoin.”He also called for more “transparency” about happens to the biometric data that “users deliver to these companies, in this case in exchange for a payment in cryptocurrency.”Worldcoin has proven a hit in Argentina, where it operates over 50 iris-scanning centers.Buenos Aires MPs Want Worldcoin Investigation
The crypto project has piqued the interest of more Argentina lawmakers.In mid-April, Romina Braga, another member of the Buenos Aires assembly, called for an official investigation into Worldcoin.Braga called on Axel Kicillof, the Governor of the Buenos Aires Province, to commission an investigation. She also voiced several privacy and data-related concerns.A Worldcoin retina scanner orb. (Source: Steve Jurvetson [CC By 2.0])This follows a move from the national data protection agency, which announced the launch of an investigation into Worldcoin in January this year.Puglelli’s bill calls for the creation of a “regulatory framework” that regulates biometric data collection and introduces punishments for any “abuse” of this data. He explained:“It is essential to adapt our legislation to meet the challenges posed by the digital era.”Regulator to Get Involved?
The bill, if adopted, would see the Provincial Directorate for the Defense of the Rights of Consumers and Users appointed as the “supervisor” of Worldcoin.The Directorate would be charged with “promoting fair and equitable consumer relations in the digital sphere, as well as trust and IT security.”The media outlet Criptonoticias reported that Worldcoin has been operating in Argentina “for more than a year.”It added that “thousands of citizens have transferred their biometric data to the Cayman Islands-based firm.”Will Lawmakers Get Their Way?
Both Puglelli and Braga have complained that “it is not clear” exactly “what Worldcoin does with iris-scanned data.”The lawmaker warned that Worldcoin “has no legal status in Argentina and is acquiring biometric data in a way that puts privacy at stake.”.It remains to be seen if the lawmakers’ warnings will dampen public enthusiasm.However, they do not appear to be alone. The Buenos Aires Ministry of Production, Science, and Technological Innovation says it has also investigated Worldcoin’s data protection credentials.Mexican lawmakers have also raised concerns. In Chile, another country with multiple data collection centers, government agents have inspected three Worldcoin-related addresses.Agents asked the firm to submit “additional information” to “ensure that Worldcoin is complying with national regulations.”Data-related concerns have disrupted Worldcoin iris-scanning efforts in European nations, including Spain, Germany, and France.Government agencies in East Asian nations such as South Korea and Hong Kong have also launched Worldcoin-related investigations.

                        Crypto exchange Coinbase is planning to offer a Canadian dollar stablecoin on its platform shortly after receiving an official license to operate within Canada.In a Twitter update on Monday, the company said it had added QCAD (QCAD) to its listing roadmap – a CAD-pegged stablecoin that was “re-launched” by Canadian fintech firm Stablecorp last year.Canadian Dollar Stablecoin On Coinbase
Much like other popular stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), QCAD maintains its peg with full backing by reserves of equal or greater value to the number of tokens that have been issued.According to Stablecorp, these tokens are backed by cash and cash equivalents, with monthly attestation reports to verify their reserve status. Its latest attestation report in February 2024 said there were just 169,303.77 QCAD in circulation versus CAD $200,903.17 in Stablecorp’s reserves.That’s a small amount relative to stablecoin giants like USDT and USDC, which have over $140 billion USD worth of tokens combined spread throughout the crypto ecosystem.“Our goal is to list every asset possible that meets our standards for legal, compliance, and technical security,” Coinbase’s blog post on upcoming listings stated. “These standards do not take into account the market cap or popularity of a project.”As such, onboarding Coinbase – the largest crypto exchange in the United States and the only publicly traded firm of its kind – could be a boon for adoption.“With increased regulatory clarity from the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the timing is perfect to bring Canadians a transparent, efficient stablecoin,” said Stablecorp CEO Alex McDougall last year.Compliance With Canadian Regulators
Shortly after the collapse of FTX and Terra in 2022, the CSA issued guidance to crypto trading platforms, establishing a high bar for stablecoins or other pegged assets to receive listing. Stablecoins would require reserves of “highly liquid assets” with “qualified custodians,” and algorithmic stablecoins were completely ruled out.The strict guidance contributed to Kraken and Coinbase delisting USDT and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) from their platforms and to Binance moving out of the country entirely.Coinbase became the first international crypto exchange to gain registration as a “restricted dealer” in Canada last month, however, signaling its sufficient compliance with regulators.The company has often credited Canadian regulators with being cooperative with the crypto industry in ways that U.S. regulators are not. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, is currently suing Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance for securities law violations.“We’ve collaborated with Canadian banks, investment advisors, and pension funds to demonstrate our dedication to facilitating their successful navigation of the evolving digital asset realm,” the company wrote last month.

Stacks Price Prediction as STX Token Slides Under $2 – How Low Will STX Go?
                        As Bitcoin (BTC) corrects to its lowest levels in over two months below $60,000, its largest layer-2 scaling blockchain Stacks (STX) is also in decline, with the Stacks price hitting its lowest levels since mid-February below $2.0.The Stacks price has since bounced back to around $2.14, with STX now flat on the day.But it might not be long until STX breaks more forcefully to the downside of $2.06 and the $2.0 level.That’s because Stacks largely takes it cue from what Bitcoin is doing, as well as how altcoins are performing.And, as of now, pretty much the entire crypto space in a state of bearishness.Spot Bitcoin ETF flows have been negative now for five days, as per data presented by The Block.As per The Block, US ETFs have seen outflows now for five straight days.That’s not surprising given recent macro headwinds. While today’s Fed policy announcement didn’t contain any surprises, it reinforced the message that rate cuts remain some way off.The Fed has turned more hawkish recently due to inflation remaining uncomfortably high since the start of 2024.It’s no surprise then that the Bitcoin price, as well as altcoin markets, have suffered a correction.Here’s Where the Stacks Price Is Headed Next
So, risks seem tilted to the downside for Stacks (STX). The next major support level, assuming the January highs at $2.06 goes, is the 200DMA.The 200DMA currently resides just above $1.80. A break below here would send a significant bearish signal.The next major area of support that traders would target would be around $1.25.If Stacks was to fall 40% to here, its market cap would subside to under $2 billion.This could be a great time to load up on STX, which remains a major leader in Bitcoin layer-2 scaling.The Stacks price could slump all the way as low as $1.25 support. Source: TradingViewAmid the bearish outlook for altcoins like Stacks, traders are hunting for alternatives that could deliver near-term upside.Presale investing is an often-overlooked strategy that can deliver strong returns.And one presale has caught the attention of analysts at Cryptonews – Mega Dice.The well-established crypto casino just launched a presale of its utility token DICE.DICE holders get big cashback benefits on their wagers and can also generate passive income via DICE staking.The crypto casino is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors.The project has already raised $660,000.

Bitcoin's Historical Data Suggests A Potential 99% Surge, Says Crypto Analyst: 'Time To Buy The Dip!' - Benzinga

As the cryptocurrency market continues to experience turbulence, Bitcoin BTC/USD might be on the brink of a significant upswing, according to historical data.What Happened: Ali Martinez, a prominent crypto analyst, took to social media platform X to share a promising insight. Martinez highlighted the potential for a substantial Bitcoin surge, based on historical trends.“The last three times the #Bitcoin 30-day MVRV dropped below -9% in the last two years, the price of $BTC surged by 64%, 63%, and 99%, respectively. The #BTC 30-day MVRV is currently at -11.6%, suggesting it may be time to buy the dip!” Martinez wrote.The MVRV ratio, which divides an asset’s market capitalization by its realized capitalization, is a pivotal metric in the crypto space. A higher MVRV ratio typically indicates a greater potential profit, potentially leading to increased selling pressure.See Also: How Did Shiba Inu Become The ‘Dogecoin Killer?’ Crypto Whale Thinks ‘Its Mission’ And This One Factor Were KeyWhy It Matters: This insight comes at a time when the crypto market is facing significant challenges. On the same day, Bitcoin’s value dropped below $58,000, triggering losses for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum ETH/USD, Solana SOL/USD, and Dogecoin DOGE/USD.Moreover, crypto research firm 10x Research has predicted a further 20% drop in Bitcoin’s value, citing the differing risk management approaches between institutional investors and retail traders.However, if Martinez’s analysis holds true, Bitcoin could be on the verge of a remarkable recovery. This is particularly noteworthy in light of concerns raised by analysts about potential selling pressure from retail “degens” who bought Bitcoin ETFs at around $58,000.Price Action: Bitcoin is currently priced at $57,635, marking a 1.08% decrease over the last 24 hours. However, it has seen an impressive 30.48% increase since the beginning of the year, according to the data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Are Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Due A Bounce?

Crypto Witch-Hunt: Experts Criticize DOJ's Ver Indictment


								On Tuesday, the crypto industry was shaken after news of the indictment of one of a Bitcoin early investors broke. Per the reports, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) pressed multiple charges against Roger Ver, a controversial figure in the space known as “Bitcoin Jesus.”
Experts and figures within the community have expressed their sentiments about Ver’s arrestment, with some considering the US administration is on a “crypto witch-hunt.”

Was Roger Ver’s Indictment Celebrated?
On April 30, Roger Ver was detained by Spanish authorities on charges of tax evasion, mail fraud, and false tax returns. The indictment came the same day as former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao’s four-month sentence.
The prosecutors allege that Ver, who renounced his US citizenship in 2014, failed to report the gains from Bitcoin sales held by his US companies and consequently failed to pay the required taxes.
As a result, the “Bitcoin Jesus” is now being accused of causing a $48 million loss to the IRS, and the US is seeking his extradition from Spain.
After the news, several crypto experts and community members commented on the charges, some considering it a “good” thing. Bitcoin educator and investor Dan Held was among those who “celebrated” the detention.


In an X post, Held stated that Roger Ver has “been a negative for Bitcoin.” To the investor, Ver “misaligned expectations around Bitcoin so much that it led to a civil war. He deserves everything that he’s about to get.”
Some members of the crypto community partially agreed with Held’s sentiment. One X user considers Ver responsible for attempting to destroy Bitcoin during the “Blocksize War.”
DOJ Faces Backlash For “Overreaching” And Unclear Crypto Landscape
Overall, the sentiment leans against Roger Ver’s prosecution. To many, the DOJ’s actions are part of the US government’s efforts to target the crypto industry. 2024 US House candidate Jane Adams called the indictment “a blatant attack on dissent,” adding that the US administration’s “pursuit is fueled by vindictiveness, not justice.”
Similarly, founder and CEO of Layer Two Labs Paul Sztorc also expressed his concern: “Not exactly government via the consent of the governed…,” he stated in an X post.
According to crypto investor and expert Kim Dotcom, the charges against Ver “has nothing to do with tax evasion.” Instead, the crypto veteran considers that the US government is on a witch-hunt, “a malicious attempt to vilify Roger and to punish him for exposing and opposing the crimes of the US empire.”


The investor argues that at the time of the Bitcoin sales used for the indictment, the crypto industry was “the wild west of investing.” As a result, there were no clear regulations and guidance on the cryptocurrency’s legal status:

How do you assess the value of such an illiquid asset back in 2014? To now claim, a decade later, that Roger owes $50 million in taxes to the US Govt is ludicrous (…) It’s also a hopeless attempt to attach a value to something that was trading in a fragile, volatile and unregulated market in 2014.

The crypto community has widely discussed the US’s unclear and inconsistent regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Consensys’ recent demand against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) highlighted the contradictory guidance from the country’s regulators.
These contradictions have caused US congress members like Patrick McHenry to consider the SEC’s efforts to regulate “by enforcement” to be driven by an “arbitrary and capricious nature.” Ultimately, it urges “a clear regulatory framework and robust consumer protections for digital asset markets.”

MicroStrategy to launch Bitcoin-based decentralized ID solution

MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, has announced it will launch a decentralized identity solution on the Bitcoin network that uses Ordinal-based inscriptions to store and retrieve information.The solution — MicroStrategy Orange — was unveiled by MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor during the company’s Bitcoin For Corporations conference on May 1.MicroStrategy Orange is open-source, not dependent on sidechains and can process up to 10,000 decentralized identifiers in a single Bitcoin (BTC) transaction, Saylor claimed.“[Its aim is to] deliver trustless, tamper-proof, and long-lived decentralized identities using only the public Bitcoin blockchain as a data source,” according to an unofficial draft document of the solution shared by MicroStrategy on GitHub.The decentralized identifiers (DIDs) will allow pseudonymity in the same way that real-world identities are not tied to Bitcoin addresses and transactions.Saylor speaking at the Bitcoin For Corporations conference. Source: YouTubeMicroStrategy Orange comprises Orange Service, Orange SDK and Orange Applications. Orange Service allows users to issue DIDs to their personnel and deploy applications, while Orange SDK and Orange Applications provide customization tools to integrate specific services on mobile and desktop devices.One application already built by MicroStrategy is “Orange For Outlook,” which integrates digital signatures into emails to ensure recipients can verify the true identity of the sender.The onboarding process involves accepting an invitation email signed by MicroStrategy’s DID, which will then generate a unique DID, a public and private key pair for the user. The user’s DID and public key are inscribed on the Bitcoin network, and they can then start sending out invitations to their personnel to create their own digital identity.Flow diagram of how MicroStrategy’s Orange For Outlook application works.

Bitcoin Hits ‘Danger Zone’: Peter Schiff Warns Of 'Do or Die' Scenario


                            Bitcoin is facing a critical juncture as it has entered a ‘danger zone,’ according to prominent gold advocate Peter Schiff. This investor, known for his skepticism toward Bitcoin, suggests that the cryptocurrency is entering a “do or die” phase, potentially marking the end of its bullish run if current trends continue.
Breaking Points And Bearish Signals
Peter Schiff has often voiced his bearish outlook on Bitcoin, and his latest comments come as Bitcoin has just slipped below the crucial $60,000 mark.

This level had previously served as strong support during the short-term bull run, and its breach has intensified the bearish sentiment among investors. Schiff warns that staying below this threshold could spell doom for the bullish fervor, potentially derailing Bitcoin’s momentum.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $57,054, teetering close to its 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Schiff points out that remaining below this EMA could confirm a bearish trend, signaling an end to the rally.
Amidst these developments, the market has seen an increase in trading volume, coupled with the price drop, indicating strong selling pressure.
Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin’s trading volume has dropped from $45 billion to $48 billion, coinciding with a 6.3% price dip during the same period. This heightened activity is a traditional bearish indicator, lending weight to Schiff’s prediction of a downturn.
Moreover, investor sentiment is treading thin ice with significant outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs, hitting a weekly high of $162 million. This departure of funds is particularly poignant as it unfolds just before the FOMC meeting, where potential interest rate hikes are on the agenda.
These outflows reflect a broader market trend, with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experiencing a substantial daily outflow of $93.23 million.

The Bitcoin ETF Conundrum And Market Forecasts
It is worth noting that last month was quite challenging for US Bitcoin ETFs. After a promising start with positive inflows in the initial months following their launch, April witnessed collective outflows amounting to $182 million across all active spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US.

This pullback is attributed to macroeconomic concerns and geopolitical tensions, which have clouded the investment landscape.

As the market braces for further turbulence, analysts such as Micheal Van de Poppe are forecasting an additional correction, potentially pushing Bitcoin’s price down to $55,000 before any sign of recovery.

Senator Lummis Challenges US Crackdown On Crypto Market, Vows To Protect Investor’s Rights | Bitcoinist.com


								In the face of growing global regulatory pressure on the crypto industry, the Biden administration’s intensified crackdown and the actions of regulatory bodies have prompted Senator Cynthia Lummis to issue a strong statement against the US government’s stance on the industry. 
Senator Lummis, a prominent supporter of Bitcoin and the overall crypto market, has advocated for the companies and players involved in the ongoing regulatory pressure.
Lummis Condemns DOJ’s “Hyper-Aggressive” Stance
Lummis expressed deep concern and opposed the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) “hyper-aggressive” argument that non-custodial software could be classified as a money transmission service. 
The Senator deemed this stance contradictory to existing Treasury guidance, lacking common sense, and violating the rule of law. 

Lummis further emphasized that arguments against self-custody software pose a threat to fundamental property rights that are intrinsic to being an American. 
Lummis asserted her commitment to fighting for individuals’ rights to hold their keys and operate their nodes, expressing her dismay at the Biden administration’s criminalization of the core tenets of the Bitcoin (BTC) network and decentralized finance (DeFi).
Senator Lummis had previously disapproved of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) escalated crackdown on the crypto industry throughout 2023. 
Criticizing the SEC’s actions as “unnecessary” and “overreaching,” she specifically opposed the agency’s controversial new crypto policy, known as “Staff Accounting Bulletin 121,” issued in March 2022. 
Lummis had also filed an amicus brief in support of the Coinbase exchange against the SEC’s lawsuit, arguing that Congress should be responsible for formulating crypto regulations rather than the SEC. 
The pro-crypto Senator contended that the SEC had exceeded its mandate by attempting to classify almost all crypto assets as “securities,” thus infringing on Congress’s legislative authority and extending beyond the agency’s jurisdiction.
Clear Guidelines For Crypto Regulation
In another statement supporting key players in the crypto market, Senator Lummis called for immediate action to establish clear regulatory guidelines in response to Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling that XRP should not be considered a security. 

At the core of the debate is the Howey Test, a legal standard used to determine whether an investment qualifies as a security. Lummis has emphasized the importance of preserving the integrity of this test while acknowledging the need to apply it appropriately to digital assets.
To address these issues, Senator Lummis, in collaboration with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, has introduced the Lummis-Gillibrand bill. The legislation aims to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets like XRP, aligning their treatment with the interpretation of the Howey Test as established by the Southern District of New York.

The largest cryptocurrency on the market, Bitcoin, is trading at $57,800 after hitting a low of $56,400 in the early hours of Wednesday.

Bitcoin Tops Returns In All Asset Classes Amid 'Repeatedly Disappointing Inflation Data': Mohamed El-Erian Shares Insights On Market Volatility - Benzinga

Renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian shared a comprehensive table of financial returns for major assets and asset classes, highlighting the volatility of the market in April.What Happened: El-Erian, in his post on X, acknowledged the challenging market conditions in April, despite the solid year-to-date returns. He noted the significant repricing of Fed cuts due to consistently disappointing inflation data.“While April proved to be the toughest month so far in 2024 for some of them, the year-to-date returns remain solid overall — especially given the extent to which markets have repriced their expectations of Fed cuts in response to repeatedly disappointing inflation data,” El-Erian wrote. He shared a table, covering the performance of major indices from 2020 to Apr. 30, which shows diverse results across different asset classes and regions. Notably, Bitcoin BTC/USD has been the top performer in all asset classes.The indices covered include the DJIA, S&P 500, Nasdaq, Stoxx Euro 600, FTSE 100 Index, Shanghai Composite Index, NIKKEI 225 Index, Gold, Oil, and Bitcoin.Bitcoin’s journey has been particularly volatile, with a 303.95% surge in 2020, followed by a 64.21% drop in 2022. However, it made a strong comeback in 2023 with a 153.32% gain. As of Apr. 30, its year-to-date performance stands at a solid 39.09%, demonstrating its resilience amidst market fluctuations.See Also: Is The ‘Memecoin Supercycle’ Over? Mad Crypto Alpha With IvanWhy It Matters: El-Erian’s insights come at a time when the Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates steady, emphasizing the need to allow more time for restrictive monetary policies to bring inflation towards the Fed's 2% goal. This decision has had a significant impact on market dynamics."The inflation data received so far this year have been higher than expected," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said today, adding that it is likely that gaining greater confidence in disinflation will take longer than previously thought.Addressing concerns about potential rate hikes due to recent inflationary pressures, Powell said: "I think it's unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike. We'd need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2% overtime. That's not what we think we're seeing."Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s historical data suggests a potential 99% surge, according to a prominent crypto analyst. This insight, combined with El-Erian’s observations, underscores the complex dynamics at play in the current market.Price Action: Bitcoin is currently priced at $57,635, marking a 1.08% decrease over the last 24 hours. However, it has seen an impressive 30.48% increase since the beginning of the year, according to the data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: ‘Spectacular Meme Runs’ Mean These Three Altcoins Could Be ‘Doomed To Irrelevancy,’ Muses Veteran TraderImage Via Wikimedia CommonsThis content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

Four Solana Memecoins That Could Rally Over 8,000% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Shibarium's Transaction Fees Skyrocket 500% Amid Surging Network Activity



                    

Shibarium, a Layer-2 blockchain tailored for the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency, has witnessed a dramatic 500% increase in transaction fees within a 24-hour period, as shown by Shibariumscan data. 



Fees paid in BONE, the native token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, escalated from 12 BONE to 61.47 BONE. 




Shibarium’s core functionality involves processing Shiba Inu token transfers, with BONE tokens utilized to pay for transaction costs. 



Each transaction also aids in reducing the supply of SHIB tokens, as a part of the BONE fees is converted to SHIB and then removed from circulation by being sent to a “dead wallet.”



The sharp rise in Shibarium’s fees is primarily linked to a surge in network activity, driven by increasing popularity and demand for Shiba Inu tokens during recent market fluctuations and growing investor interest. 



Shibariumscan also highlighted a significant 211% increase in active accounts on the platform, rising from 1,724 to 3,650.

Despite this, the number of new accounts actually declined, suggesting that the increased activity primarily came from existing users.



The recent developments pose several questions regarding the future of the Shiba Inu network. 




Observers are keen to understand how this uptick in fees might influence further activity within the ecosystem. 



Questions also arise about Shibarium’s capacity to handle continued demand without compromising on efficiency and scalability. 




Additionally, the impact of these changes on SHIB and BONE tokens is of particular interest, especially given the current instability in the broader cryptocurrency market dominated by bearish sentiment.



This scenario highlights the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets, where user behavior and technological capabilities continuously interact to shape the landscape. 



The developments in Shibarium and Shiba Inu will be closely watched as they provide insights into user engagement, technological adaptability, and market trends in the cryptocurrency space.

Bitcoin 4% dip may ‘panic’ short-term holders as price falls below average cost

Bitcoin is now trading below the average purchase price paid by short-term holders, potentially causing “panic” due to unrealized losses, according to an on-chain analyst.“These recent buyers are statistically the most likely to panic,” analyst James Check, known as “Checkmatey,” said in a May 1 report.“What a nuke we have on our hands to open the month of May,” Check added, referring to Bitcoin (BTC) briefly plummeting 8% below a key support level to $56,814 on May 1, according to CoinMarketCap data.The recent price drop saw Bitcoin hit its lowest level since February, which is significant for short-term Bitcoin holders — those who have held for under 155 days — as they paid an average price of $59,600 per Bitcoin.Even though the price has slightly recovered to $57,631 at the time of publication, short-term holders still hold an average 3% unrealized loss.Bitcoin’s price at the time of writing represents a decline of 4% in the past 24 hours. The sharp downturn led to the liquidation of $100.27 million in long positions over that time, according to CoinGlass data.Its price decline was driven by a crypto sell-off as market participants awaited the United States Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision, which kept the current high interest rates unchanged, as analysts expected.Bitcoin’s price briefly plummeted to its lowest price in three months on May 1.

Uniswap, the SEC and Regulatory Riptide - What DeFi Must Do Next - The Daily Hodl


								
 
DeFi (decentralized finance) has been nothing short of a revolution. Its startling promise – to upend traditional financial systems and usher in an era of unprecedented accessibility, transparency and autonomy.
From humble beginnings, this new ecosystem has undergone explosive growth, now boasting a fervent global following and billions in investment.
Naturally, as the DeFi juggernaut has gained momentum, it has also drawn both the watchful eye of regulators and the attention of nefarious actors.
The U.S. SEC’s (Securities and Exchange Commission) recent decision to issue a Wells notice to Uniswap, one of the industry’s pioneering decentralized exchanges – alleging violations of securities laws – has sent shockwaves through the DeFi community.
This regulatory crackdown, coupled with a string of high-profile hacks and exploits that have drained projects of millions in funds, has cast a pall of uncertainty over the future of the sector.
In a maelstrom of innovation, regulation and security risks, the ecosystem stands at a precipice.
The decisions made and actions taken by industry leaders, developers and regulatory bodies in the coming years will shape the trajectory of the movement, determining whether it will fulfill its promise of disrupting traditional finance or succumb to the very forces it seeks to supplant.
SEC crackdown on Uniswap
In a rather zealous attempt to assert regulatory control, the SEC has set its sights on Uniswap, one of DeFi’s trailblazers.
The allegations – that it has facilitated the trading of unregistered securities, specifically tokens issued through ICOs (initial coin offerings) – paint the platform as an unregistered securities broker and exchange.
However, this narrative conveniently ignores the decentralized nature of the protocol.
While Uniswap Labs developed the front-end interface, the underlying protocol operates autonomously, without any centralized control or oversight.
This fundamental distinction seems to have escaped the SEC’s understanding.
By targeting a project like Uniswap, which has been a driving force behind the DeFi revolution, the SEC risks stifling innovation and undermining the very principles that make DeFi so revolutionary.
If the SEC’s overreach is not curtailed, the implications for the broader DeFi ecosystem could be far-reaching.
Projects that have embraced transparency and community governance may find themselves in the crosshairs, deterring further innovation and driving developers and users away from the United States.
Regulatory challenges and security vulnerabilities
As the SEC tightens its grip, DeFi platforms and protocols face a multitude of regulatory hurdles beyond the Uniswap debacle.
However, the regulatory challenges pale in comparison to the existential threat posed by the wave of hacks and exploits plaguing the ecosystem.
The inherent transparency of open-source protocols – once heralded as a strength – has become a double-edged sword, exposing vulnerabilities to nefarious actors who can meticulously dissect the code.
The staggering losses suffered by DeFi projects, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, serve as a sobering reminder of the grave consequences of security lapses.
The Munchables exploit, which saw a rogue developer abscond with over $62 million in funds, underscores the risks associated with the pseudonymous nature of DeFi development teams.
The incident highlights the overall need for more due diligence, especially around hiring personnel.
While the ethos of decentralization and immutability are noble ideals, they can hinder the ability to respond effectively to security breaches.
Calls for interventions and chain rollbacks in the wake of such incidents highlight the tension between user protection and the core principles of DeFi.
Addressing security and navigating compliance
As the DeFi ecosystem grapples with a seemingly unending barrage of hacks and exploits, stringent security measures have become an existential necessity.
The industry’s reliance on cutting-edge yet inherently complex smart contract technology has exposed vulnerabilities that can be exploited by skilled adversaries.
To chart a path toward a more secure future, DeFi projects must embrace a holistic approach to security that permeates every aspect of development and deployment.
Rigorous audits, conducted by seasoned cybersecurity professionals, must become the norm.
Penetration testing should be a continuous process, proactively identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities.
Moreover, the industry must wholeheartedly embrace bug bounty programs, incentivizing ethical hackers to uncover weaknesses in exchange for substantial rewards.
Ultimately, the path to a secure DeFi future hinges on striking a delicate balance between innovation and risk management.
While the allure of decentralization is undeniable, its principles must be tempered by a pragmatic recognition of real-world threats that imperil user funds and erode trust in the ecosystem.
In the wake of the SEC’s crackdown, it has become increasingly evident that the industry can no longer afford to operate in a regulatory vacuum.
The commission’s actions underscore the pressing need for the DeFi ecosystem to proactively engage with regulators and collaborate on establishing industry-wide standards.
By actively participating in the regulatory discourse, DeFi pioneers have an opportunity to shape the rules of engagement, ensuring that any frameworks or guidelines imposed are tailored to the unique characteristics of DeFi.
This collaborative approach not only mitigates the risk of stifling overregulation but also enhances the legitimacy and credibility of the industry in the eyes of the public and traditional financial institutions.
Essentials for the road ahead
As the DeFi ecosystem navigates the turbulent waters of regulatory scrutiny and security breaches, it finds itself at a pivotal crossroads.
The SEC’s crackdown on Uniswap has crystallized the urgent need for DeFi projects to prioritize not only innovation but also regulatory compliance.
By proactively engaging with regulators and collaborating on the establishment of industry-wide standards, the ecosystem can shape the rules of engagement, ensuring that oversight is tailored to the unique characteristics of decentralized finance.
Yet, amid these challenges, lies a remarkable opportunity for the DeFi ecosystem to redefine the boundaries of financial innovation.
By striking a delicate balance between decentralization and user protection, transparency and oversight, the industry can harness the transformative potential of blockchain technology while safeguarding the interests of participants and fostering trust among the broader public.
The road ahead is arduous, but the rewards of success are immense.
By embracing a spirit of collaboration – both within the industry and with regulatory bodies – DeFi pioneers can catalyze a paradigm shift in finance, ushering in a new era of inclusivity, autonomy and transparency.
Ultimately, the future of DeFi hinges on the industry’s ability to navigate these challenges with resilience, foresight and an unwavering commitment to its core principles.
Only then can the true potential of this revolutionary technology be realized, empowering individuals and communities worldwide to take control of their financial destinies.

SEC and Terraform Will Discuss Proposed Remedies on May 22


							

Terraform Labs challenges the huge $5.3 billion penalty imposed by the SEC in the legal case.



The firm requests the court for a lower penalty of $1 million arguing that Terraform’s most of the stablecoins were sold overseas.



Judge Jed Rakoff orders the lawyers representing Terraform and the SEC to assemble in the court on May 22.




According to a recent Bloomberg report, Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, challenged the huge $5.3 billion penalty proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the lawsuit. Claiming that most of the firm’s stablecoins were sold overseas, the company requested the court to charge a significantly lower penalty of $1 million.



On April 5, a jury found Do Kwon liable for the collapse of the collapse of Terraform, which wiped out $40 billion in investor assets, leading to a severe crypto winter. While Kwon and Terraform were found guilty of defrauding investors regarding the sale of TerraUSD (UST), Luna (LUNA), and wLUNA, the regulators sought approximately $4.7 billion in disgorgement and prejudgment interest from them. In addition, the SEC charged a total of $520 million in civil penalties.









However, Terraform pleaded the court not to grant “any injunctive relief of disgorgement,”  arguing that the regulators failed to prove that it is “entitled to the expansive injunction and monetary sanctions it seeks.” Also, the platform stated that the proposed fines would have to be obtained from the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), an entity not involved in the civil case. The court filing read, “.




“In conclusion, the Court should not grant any injunctive relief or disgorgement, and should impose at most a $1 million civil penalty against TFL.” 




In an April 29 filing, Judge Jed Rakoff of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered that the SEC, Kwon, and Terraform Labs’ lawyers assemble in the court on May 22 to discuss the proposed remedies.

How did Bitcoin's price react to Fed meeting, unchanged interest rates? - AMBCrypto



US Fed left interest rate unchanged again, citing “lack of further progress” on 2% inflation target.
BTC remains under pressure despite a modest flip after the Fed meeting. 

Bitcoin [BTC] eased its two-day bleeding streak after the Fed meeting. As expected, the US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on 1st May. 
This marks the sixth Fed meeting at which the agency kept the rate at 5.25% – 5.50%. However, the Fed noted that rate cuts are not appropriate until there is greater confidence that inflation is heading to 2%. 
Part of the Fed’s policy statement read, 
“In recent months, there has been a lack of further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.”
In a later press conference, Fed chair Jerome Powell was asked whether there would be three rate cuts later in the year. To which Powell responded, 
“We didn’t see progress in the first quarter; it appears then that it’s going to take longer to reach that level of confidence.” 
In a nutshell, “the higher rates for longer” stance seems officially back. 
Bitcoin saw a modest flip as memecoins led a short recovery
Within an hour after the Fed rate decision, memecoins led a slight recovery. Bonk [BONK], Floki Inu [FLOKI], and dogwifhat [WIF] recovered by 6%. 
BTC and Ethereum [ETH] recorded a modest flip within the same period. 
In the past two days, BTC has slumped hard, shedding over 12% from a high of $64.7K to a low of $56.5K. This extended BTC’s April losses into May and underscored a tough Q2.  
After the Fed statement, BTC reclaimed $58K but dropped lower a few minutes later, denoting that it was still under immense sell pressure.  
ETH also saw a modest uptick but faced rejection at the $3000 level at the time of writing. 
With the Fed’s “higher for longer” stance and negative flows from US BTC ETFs, it will be interesting to see if BTC could reclaim the range-low around $60.8K.

DeFi lending giant Aave unveils V4 protocol overhaul

Aave Labs, the firm behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Aave has outlined a proposal for an upgrade and evolution of its protocol as part of a five-year roadmap.On May 1, the DeFi lending platform introduced a governance proposal to get community feedback on upgrading the protocol to its next-generation version 4.The proposal also includes “major upgrades and expansions,” to the Aave Network, a cross-chain liquidity layer, non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layer-1 deployments, and a “fresh new visual identity,” the team stated. Aave V4 would be built on a “completely new architecture” and include a “Unified Liquidity Layer” to enable better integration of features like isolation pools, risk modules, and its native stablecoin GHO.Other proposed features are interest rates that can automatically adjust on the fly based on market conditions and using Chainlink data oracles. Also suggested were Liquidity Premiums to adjust borrowing costs based on collateral risk profiles and vaults and smart accounts for simplified user management of positions. Proposed Unified Liquidity Layer infrastructure for liquidity providing. Source: AavePart of the proposal focused on Aave’s algorithmic stablecoin GHO which was launched in July 2023 but is a minnow compared to its competitors such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) with a market capitalization of $49 million.GHO-related suggestions include improvements to the liquidation engine such as variable liquidation bonuses and “soft” liquidations, along with better integration of GHO such as options to earn interest.An emergency redemption mechanism for GHO depegging scenarios was also proposed as part of the big upgrade. The proposal is currently in the “temperature check” phase which provides a signal on community sentiment prior to moving toward an on-chain vote. It outlines a development timeline stretching from research completion in Q2, 2024 to a full V4 release by mid-2025.Related: Aave launches proposal to counter MakerDAO DAI expansion riskAave Labs is requesting a grant with a budget of 15 million GHO and 25,000 stkAAVE, worth around $17 million combined for the execution of the first year of the three-year plan.

MicroStrategy Introduces Orange: A Bitcoin-Based DID Protocol


MicroStrategy, a US-based business intelligence and software company, has introduced a new decentralized identification protocol named Orange. This innovative protocol was unveiled at the annual MicroStrategy World event in Las Vegas on May 1.
Orange stands out by employing a novel method of using inscriptions as Ordinals on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain to store data related to decentralized identities (DID). The protocol utilizes the Segregated Witness (SegWit) feature of Bitcoin. It also enables documents to be created and updated with minimal restrictions on size and content.
Why is MicroStrategy’s Orange Different from Other DID Solutions?
During a segment called “Bitcoin Security,” Michael Saylor, co-founder and Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, explained the idea behind Orange protocol.

“Our vision is to provide an internet native decentralized digital identity backed by Bitcoin. So, we want to use the open standard of DID, and we want to use the open standard of Bitcoin and put the two together … Why would we use Bitcoin? Well, it is fault tolerance, it is censorship resistance, it does use the most advanced cryptography, it’s a lot better than most people’s taskwork managers and this federated system. It is distributed … It’s open, permisionless, egalitarian, ” Saylor said.

Furthermore, Saylor highlighted that the protocol ensures that the decentralized identities are managed efficiently, reducing transaction fees and block space utilization—which are common concerns in blockchain operations. Yet, it is still unclear when MicroStrategy will officially launch the Orange protocol.
Based on the information on their “unofficial draft” on Github, the technological foundation of Orange is based on Bitcoin’s inscription. Orange embeds DID information directly on the blockchain, unlike other DID methods that rely on external data sources or additional dependencies. This method secures data permanence and integrity while enhancing the digital identities’ overall functionality and forward compatibility.
For instance, the Bitcoin Reference DID method (did:btcr) relies on referencing a URL to fetch DID document data. Such reliance can compromise the blockchain’s immutable nature if the URL content changes. In contrast, Orange stores additional data for the DID document directly on-chain.
Additionally, ION (did:ion) requires indexing all the IPFS data pointed to by Bitcoin transactions, which introduces more external dependencies. Orange’s use of taproot script path reveal transactions allows for storing arbitrary amounts of data in the witness of Bitcoin transactions through inscriptions. Therefore, Orange can avoid these dependencies.
Moreover, Orange enhances the security measures by distinguishing between the “wallet keys” used to sign Bitcoin transactions on-chain and the “subject keys” that authenticate the DID subject. This separation allows a third party to manage a DID on behalf of its subject or require multiple signatures. Hence, it offers an extra layer of security and control.

This move demonstrated MicroStrategy’s continuous support and involvement in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Earlier in February, Saylor said the firm was pivoting to a Bitcoin development strategy.

“We view ourselves as a Bitcoin development company. That means we’re going to do everything we can to grow the Bitcoin network,” he said during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings webinar on February 6.

MicroStrategy’s latest Bitcoin acquisition further solidified its long-term vision towards Bitcoin. BeInCrypto reported that MicroStrategy purchased an additional 122 BTC this April, totaling $7.8 million.
The transaction increases MicroStrategy’s holdings to 214,400 BTC, now valued at over $12.35 billion. With its holdings amount, MicroStrategy positions itself as a major player with over 1% of the finite 21 million Bitcoin supply.

US Lawmakers Introduce New Bill For Clarification on Taxation of Staking Rewards

                        Two bipartisan U.S. lawmakers, Representatives Drew Ferguson and Wiley Nickel, have proposed the Providing Tax Clarity for Digital Assets Act to address taxation issues related to block rewards earned by crypto miners. The bill aims to clarify the tax treatment of staking rewards, proposing that they should only be taxed at the time of their sale rather than upon acquisition. This move seeks to prevent double taxation and provide much-needed clarity for investors and businesses in the digital asset industry.Crypto Taxation Through Staking RewardsRepresentative Ferguson emphasized the complexity of the current tax treatment of digital asset rewards, highlighting the confusion it causes among investors and the potential for American businesses to relocate overseas due to regulatory uncertainty.“The United States has long been the leader in innovation and technology yet is falling behind our foreign counterparts in providing tax clarity for the emerging digital asset industry. The United States’ treatment of digital asset rewards is overly complex – leading to confusion by investors, double taxation, and American businesses relocating overseas,” said Ferguson.The proposed legislation aims to establish clear tax guidelines for block rewards from proof-of-work and proof-of-stake networks, aligning taxation with the sale or spending of these rewards rather than their acquisition.The move comes in response to recent IRS rulings and the landscape of digital assets taxation. The bill seeks to provide much-needed clarity and fairness in tax treatment, ensuring that block rewards are taxed only once, at the time of their sale or exchange. This initiative reflects growing bipartisan efforts to address regulatory challenges in the digital asset space and foster innovation within the United States. Even Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, called the legislation “right on point” for providing adequate guidance.Stablecoin Legislation Bill Still Pending
According to a Democratic aide on Capitol Hill, proposed stablecoin legislation is unlikely to be attached to the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) reauthorization bill. Despite efforts by Representatives Maxine Waters and Patrick McHenry, leaders in both the Senate and the House of Representatives are hesitant to merge stablecoin legislation with the FAA bill, which is considered a must-pass piece of legislation.While combining the two bills would be unprecedented in financial services policy, lawmakers typically add less popular legislation to larger bills to garner bipartisan support.The Digital Chamber’s chief policy officer, Cody Carbone, expressed scepticism about the likelihood of stablecoin legislation passing before the U.S. presidential election, giving it only a 35% chance. Carbone highlighted the ongoing debate surrounding key issues such as regulatory oversight and state-level regulation, which have hindered the progress of stablecoin bills like Representative Patrick McHenry’s Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act and the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act.

                        Crypto-related phishing attacks have become “rampant” in South Korea, a report has claimed, with a top financial regulator set to act.Per Namdo Ilbo, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) will team up with the nation’s biggest crypto exchanges to create promotional materials. The regulator wants to boost public awareness of common crypto scams.Crypto Phishing Attacks ‘Rampant’ – FSS Prepares Response
On April 29, the FSS announced plans to publish a “casebook” of case studies and “tips.” The regular said it hopes this will help citizens identify and avoid crypto-related fraud.The FSS said that the casebook contained an analysis of 2,209 reports of crypto-related phishing attacks logged from January to April.The regulator said that the reports had been processed by the nation’s Virtual Asset-related Investment Fraud Reporting Center.The data shows that chat app-based crypto “reading rooms” have become a hotbed of crypto phishing schemes.Almost 27 of all the 2,209 reports originated from these open channels, ostensibly set up as knowledge-sharing resources for South Korean crypto enthusiasts.Police have shut down multiple rings operating “reading rooms”-type scams in recent years.Fake Exchanges Target South Korean Crypto Enthusiasts
Some 19% of the cases, meanwhile, were related to “unregistered” or bogus crypto exchanges.The regulator explained that it had identified seven overarching themes in the most recent phishing report, namely:
Prompting victims to send coins to bogus crypto exchanges
Romance scams, whereby catfished victims are encouraged to “invest in crypto projects together”
Fake token lock-ups
NFT-related fraud
Scams whereby fraudsters impersonate crypto exchange employees
Scams whereby fraudsters pose as vendors of bona fide cryptoassets like Bitcoin (BTC)
Scams that originate on chat app-based crypto “reading rooms”
Case Studies Show Devastating Effects
The regulator’s case studies include the story of a citizen who received an Instagram direct message from an individual claiming to be a pilot based in the United States.After developing a “romantic relationship,” the “pilot” said that they had earned a considerable amount of money by investing in crypto.The “pilot” would regularly send the victim photos of luxury goods supposedly bought with these crypto trading profits.The victim then agreed to “invest” a small amount of money, which accrued a modest “profit.”Then the victim agreed to take out a bank loan worth around $217,000. They then used this money to buy cryptoassets.The “pilot” instructed the victim to send the coins to a “crypto exchange,” which turned out to be bogus.When the victim tried to “withdraw” the coins from the “exchange,” they realized that they had been duped.The FSS said that it would publish the casebook on its website and would also provide printouts to “the financially vulnerable” at senior welfare centers.The headquarters of the Financial Supervisory Service in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Wikiwater2020 [CC BY-SA 3.0])The regulator said that groups “such as the elderly” were particularly at risk. Government bodies have issued similar warnings in Japan.FSS spokespeople said they would also distribute the casebook at employment support centers and metropolitan local government centers “across the country.” An official said:“If you suspect that you have fallen victim to an investment fraud similar to the case listed in the casebook, please report this to the FSS immediately. Alternatively, please contact the police and request assistance.”The media outlet noted that the FSS was working on the project with the Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA).DAXA comprises the exchanges Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax, all of which have permits to offer KRW trading in South Korea.And DAXA said it plans to post the casebook and educational videos on phishing protection on its members’ social media channels.Late last year, the body said it would work with financial regulators to hunt down “undeclared crypto operators.”

Solana to Avalanche: Tracking the memecoin frenzy across networks - AMBCrypto



Avalanche’s daily memecoin transaction count hit 10k twice in March.
The memecoin frenzy subsided significantly on Avalanche, aligning with the drop in Solana’s numbers.

As the market remained awestruck by the scale of memecoin activity on networks such as Solana [SOL] and Base, another prominent layer-1 (L1) blockchain was quietly rising through the ranks.
Avalanche very much in the race
According to on-chain analyst Alex, Avalanche [AVAX] witnessed significant speculation around these community coins in the last two months.
The Dune Analytics dashboard prepared by him showed daily transaction count topping 10,000 twice in March, with substantial volumes also seen in early April.
Source: Dune Analytics
Additionally, the number of users actively participating in these transactions also surged, ripping past 4,000 on two occasions in March. Note that this was also the time when Solana was exploding with memecoin frenzy.
The most popular among the meme tokens was Coq Inu [COQ], a chicken-themed coin. It has maintained a 40%-60% share of all meme currency transactions on the network.
In fact, at the peak of the frenzy in March, it had pumped more than 4x in a span of two weeks, AMBCrypto noted using CoinMarketCap data. At press time though, the token was nursing losses.
As seen in the graph above, the frenzy subsided significantly as April progresses, which aligned with the cool-off witnessed in the case of Solana.
The Avalanche foundation, the developer of the Avalanche chain, started making strategic investments in memecoins, seeing their upside potential. Apart from COQ, some of the other coins selected for investments were Kimbo (KIMBO) and Gecko (GEC).

Realistic or not, here’s AVAX market cap in BTC’s terms

How memecoins could help AVAX
Higher meme coin speculation could increase deflationary pressure on the ecosystem’s native token AVAX, as Avalanche burns all the revenue it generates from transaction fees.
Meanwhile, AVAX, was trading 1.5% lower at press time, a situation slightly better than most leading coins in the market.

MicroStrategy Launches Orange Protocol- MicroStrategy Orange


							

MicroStrategy announces the launch of MicroStrategy, a decentralized identity solution using Bitcoin blockchain.



During the MicroStrategy World 2024 event in Las Vegas, Michael Saylor hinted at the platform’s plan to launch the Orange protocol.



The firm envisions ensuring a secure and efficient management of digital identities through UTXOs.




MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC), has recently announced the launch of MicroStrategy Orange, a decentralized identity solution using the Bitcoin blockchain. The platform introduced MicroStrategy Orange during the Bitcoin for Corporations segment at the MicroStrategy World 2024 event in Las Vegas.



At the event, MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor put forward an interesting question, “Wouldn’t it be great if instead of a blue check, green check, etc., there was an orange check that was a global standard?” He added that such an idea of decentralized identity with Bitcoin would be realized through MicroStrategy.







A Bitcoin proponent, Dylan LeClair, took to X to share insights on MicroStrategy’s Orange protocol. Explaining the protocol’s use of Bitcoin DID, he wrote, “The Bitcoin Inscription DID method (did:btc) uses inscriptions in witness data to store and manage DIDs, leveraging UTXOs for DID control.”







Reportedly, MicroStrategy Orange envisions ensuring the secure and efficient management of digital identities through unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). In addition, the protocol aims to reduce transaction fees and block space.









Saylor highlighted their vision of introducing an “internet native decentralized digital identity backed by Bitcoin” in a segment called Bitcoin Security. Further, he elaborated on the preference for Bitcoin over any other blockchains, stating,




“Well, it [Bitcoin] is fault tolerance, it is censorship resistance, it does use the most advanced cryptography, it’s a lot better than most people’s taskwork managers and this federated system. It is distributed … It’s open, permisionless, egalitarian.”




The news comes on the heels of MicroStrategy’s financial report of 2024 Q1, which marked a loss of $53.1 million. However, the report also revealed a gross profit of $85.2 million in the first quarter, representing a 74.0% gross margin.

Bitcoin’s dominance ‘likely peaked’ as altcoins ’start to wake up’ - Analyst

Bitcoin’s market share has dipped slightly, leading crypto analysts to speculate that it may have reached its peak as traders shift their focus to altcoins.“Bitcoin dominance has likely peaked,” founder of trading firm MNTrading Michaël van de Poppe claimed in a May 1 X post while explaining that “the bottom for altcoins is likely in.”“Altcoins start to wake up in their Bitcoin pairs, which means that the rotation is started,” he added.A drop in Bitcoin (BTC) dominance can signal to market participants that a potential altcoin market upswing is on the horizon as investors shift their capital from Bitcoin — considered a more stable store of value in the crypto market — to altcoins, which tend to experience more volatility.“Bitcoin dominance is now losing major support,” added crypto trader Matthew Hyland, indicating that he will wait for the weekly close before confirming or denying “the breakdown.”Bitcoin’s dominance — measuring Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization — is 53.90%, down 1.75% over the past seven days but still up 4.63% since the start of 2024, according to TradingView data.Bitcoin’s dominance hit its year-to-date peak on April 14 at 56.42. Source: TradingView“Bitcoin Dominance dropping. If the price continues to chop for a few months, alts could take advantage. A lot of alts holding up surprisingly well today,” trading team IncomeSharks wrote in a May 1 post on X.Solana’s (SOL), Pepe (PEPE) and Dogwifhat (WIF) are slightly up over the past 24 hours at 2.76%, 3.04%, and 3.25%, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap data.The decrease in market share comes as Bitcoin’s price fell by 10.44% over the same seven-day period.Bitcoin’s price is down 4.89% over the past 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCapHowever, the current market sentiment casts doubt on speculations that Bitcoin’s dominance has peaked. Rising fear levels indicate market uncertainty and could drive traders to reallocate funds back into Bitcoin rather than riskier crypto assets.Related: Bitcoin price loses $60K support to hit 2-month lowsAccording to The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, May 1 reflects the highest level of fear among crypto market investors since the beginning of the year.On May 1, the index score — which represents the emotional sentiment of the market — fell to a “fear” level of 43, down from the previous day's “neutral” score of 54.

MicroStrategy unveils Bitcoin-based decentralized identity protocol with Ordinals-inspired technique - Crypto Briefing




MicroStrategy has announced the development of a decentralized identity solution on the Bitcoin blockchain. The protocol, dubbed MicroStrategy Orange, adopts a Bitcoin Inscription DID method, similar to the Ordinals technique, to manage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) using Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) for control. Michael Saylor, the company’s co-founder and executive chairman, unveiled the innovation at the Bitcoin For Corporations conference on May 1.“The Bitcoin Inscription DID method (did:btc) uses the bitcoin blockchain exclusively to store and retrieve DID information. UTXOs on chain are used to control DIDs. Inscribing data in the witness of transactions allows for greater extensibility and verbosity when creating DID documents, while reducing fees and block space consumed,” as noted in a draft of a potential specification (the document) of the new solution on MicroStrategy GitHub.According to Saylor, MicroStrategy Orange is an open-source initiative that does not rely on sidechains and is capable of processing up to 10,000 DIDs in a single Bitcoin transaction. The system aims to simplify the adoption of DIDs for organizations and individuals, offering a way to manage online identities securely and pseudonymously.“The goal of this method is to deliver trustless, tamper-proof, and long-lived decentralized identities using only the public bitcoin blockchain as a data source, while enabling full compatibility with the [DID-CORE] specification and forward compatibility for future extensions,” stated the document.DIDs offer a pseudonymous way to manage online identities, distinct from real-world identities, enhancing privacy. The MicroStrategy Orange suite includes the Orange Service for organizations to issue DIDs, the Orange SDK for developers, and Orange Applications like “Orange For Outlook” for digitally signing emails.The onboarding process involves an invitation from an organization, DID creation, and inscription on the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring the data is permanent and tamper-proof.According to Cezary Raczko, MicroStrategy executive vice president of engineering, MicroStrategy Orange’s vision is to integrate DIDs on Bitcoin with a broader “verifiable credential ecosystem.”In other words, anyone could verify the authenticity of these credentials across various applications without relying on a central authority. The verification would happen by checking the information on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is known for its immutability and security.DIDs could be used to verify user identities on social media platforms, potentially enabling a more secure, user-controlled, and decentralized way to issue and verify credentials, Raczko highlighted a potential use case of the new protocol.

DOGE Price Prediction - Dogecoin Reaches Make-or-Breaks Levels


                            Dogecoin extended losses and traded below the $0.1350 resistance zone against the US Dollar. DOGE is now testing an important support at $0.1200.

DOGE gained bearish momentum below the $0.140 and $0.1350 levels against the US dollar.
The price is trading below the $0.1350 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1350 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The price must settle above $0.1420 to move into a positive zone and start a fresh surge.

Dogecoin Price Extends Losses
After a close below $0.150, Dogecoin price extended losses and moved into a short-term bearish zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a drop below the $0.1350 support zone.
A low was formed at $0.1201 and DOGE is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave above the $0.1250 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1640 swing high to the $0.1201 low.
However, the bears protected more gains above the $0.130 resistance. Dogecoin is also below the $0.1420 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.130 level.

Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com
The next major resistance is near the $0.1350 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1350 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The main hurdle is at $0.1420. A close above the $0.1420 resistance and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1640 swing high to the $0.1201 low might send the price toward the $0.1550 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1620 level.
More Losses in DOGE?
If DOGE’s price fails to gain pace above the $0.1350 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1220 level.
The next major support is near the $0.120 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.120 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1040 level.
Technical Indicators
4 Hours MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone.
4 Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $0.1240, $0.1200 and $0.1040.
Major Resistance Levels – $0.1300, $0.1350, and $0.1420.

This price prediction hinges on key resistance and support levels that could dictate Bitcoin price prediction.Tax Fraud Allegations Against Roger Ver, Formerly Known as “Bitcoin Jesus”
Roger Ver, an early supporter of Bitcoin and advocate for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), faces indictment by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for allegedly evading taxes. The DOJ announced that Ver was arrested in Spain during the weekend, and the U.S. intends to request his extradition.The charges relate to actions in 2017 when Ver, having relinquished his U.S. citizenship to become a resident of St. Kitts and Nevis, is said to have sold tens of thousands of bitcoins, amassing approximately $240 million.Despite his expatriation, Ver was reportedly still required to declare his earnings and pay taxes on profits linked to U.S. entities.
Accusations: Ver is charged with failing to file tax returns and not paying taxes on capital gains from selling assets after giving up his U.S. citizenship.
Legal Requirements: Allegedly, he did not report income or taxes due on distributions from U.S. companies MemoryDealers and Agilestar.
Past Legal Troubles: Ver previously pleaded guilty and was imprisoned for selling explosives on eBay.
According to the DOJ, Ver hid from his accountant the fact that he had received and sold bitcoins from MemoryDealers and Agilestar in 2017.Consequently, his tax returns for that year did not disclose any profits or tax liabilities from these sales. Ver’s recent cryptic post on X, “Don’t expect bad people to do good things,” seems to comment on his current predicament.Simplified Explanation of the Federal Reserve’s Recent Policy Update
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged, continuing the same policy since July 2023. However, a significant change is on the horizon.Starting in June, the Fed plans to scale back its quantitative tightening (QT) program. This program involves selling off assets to reduce the money supply and potentially increase interest rates, aiming to control economic inflation.This adjustment caused U.S. Treasury yields, which affect things like mortgage and loan rates, to drop by 0.05 percentage points for both the 10-year and 2-year bonds.Here’s what’s important:
Background: From 2020 to 2022, the Fed bought a large amount of government bonds to lower interest rates and aid economic recovery post-pandemic.
Change in Strategy: Facing rising inflation in mid-2022, the Fed started selling these bonds. It currently allows $60 billion in Treasuries to mature monthly without renewal, pulling back money from the economy.
VIDEOJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, highlighted in his shareholder letter the unprecedented scale of QT and its potential impacts, expressing concern over draining more than $900 billion annually from the economy.The last major QT in 2019 led to a shortage of bank reserves, causing a “repo crisis” where overnight loan rates between banks surged, requiring Federal intervention to stabilize the situation. This history underscores the complex effects and potential risks of large-scale quantitative tightening.In today’s technical analysis of Bitcoin (BTC/USD), dated May 2, 2024, the cryptocurrency is trading at $57,520, marking a decrease of 1.25%. Bitcoin is currently positioned below its pivot point of $59,328, suggesting a bearish outlook in the short term.The key resistance levels to watch are $61,698, followed by $64,649 and $67,065. Should Bitcoin rebound, crossing these thresholds could signal a shift to a more bullish trend.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewConversely, immediate support is found at $56,624, with further cushions at $55,054 and $52,995. If these levels are breached, it may intensify the selling pressure.Technical indicators reinforce the bearish sentiment; the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 34, and the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $61,856, both suggesting potential downward momentum unless Bitcoin can sustain a move above $59,328.Unlock Cryptocurrency Rewards: Join the 99Bitcoins Presale Now!

Worldcoin Expands to Mexico; Faces Scrutiny in Argentina


Worldcoin, the ambitious crypto project co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, is expanding its footprint into Latin America. The project marked its recent move into Mexico, yet simultaneously facing regulatory challenges in Argentina.
The contrasting dynamics of Worldcoin in Latin America show the intricate balance between innovative tech growth and the need for robust data protection laws. In today’s digital era, achieving such balance is essential.
Worldcoin’s Expansion Sparks Debate on Data Protection in Latin America
In a Monday post on its official X account, Worldcoin announced that it is expanding to Mexico. Local media reported that Worldcoin has launched operations in nine different Mexico locations. This expansion makes Mexico the third-largest Latin American market for Worldcoin, trailing only behind Argentina and Chile regarding user engagement.
Despite the enthusiasm, Worldcoin’s venture in Latin America has sparked concerns among local officials in Mexico. María Eugenia Hernández, a Congressional representative from the Morena party, is one of the lawmakers who expressed her worries. On April 15, Hernández called for a thorough review of Worldcoin’s data protection practices by the National Transparency Institute (INAI).

Meanwhile, in Argentina, the reaction has been more stringent. Carlos Puglelli, a provincial deputy in Buenos Aires, has introduced legislation to regulate companies that collect biometric data through methods like iris scanning. Puglelli’s proposal seeks to establish a clear legal framework that ensures transparency, fairness, and the protection of consumer rights in digital transactions.

“It is essential to adapt our legislation to the challenges posed by the digital age. This law seeks to protect the rights of consumers and users in an increasingly digitalized environment, ensuring the privacy and security of their data,” Puglelli pointed out.


Puglelli’s legislative efforts also include creating a Provincial Registry of Digital Applications of Biometric Data to oversee and control the activities of technology companies operating in this space. This registry is part of a broader attempt to foster a safer digital environment for consumers. Therefore, it will ensure the careful handling of users’ personal information and that it is not subject to unfair contractual terms.
The legal text proposed by Puglelli mandates that any processing of personal data must be based on the users’ free, express, and informed consent. Moreover, digital application providers must adopt adequate security measures like information encryption and access controls to safeguard user data. Violations of these provisions also could lead to hefty fines and even the revocation of business permits.
His initiative followed accusations against Worldcoin for incorporating allegedly abusive clauses in their contracts. BeInCrypto reported that the Buenos Aires government prompted a $1.2 million fine for the project.
On the international front, Latin America’s expansion and regulatory responses echo global concerns about Worldcoin. Jurisdictions in Kenya and Spain have taken even more decisive actions, temporarily suspending the project’s operations amid privacy concerns.

                        The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States have witnessed record net outflows, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) experiencing its first-ever day of outflows. On May 1, BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund saw $36.9 million flow out, according to data from Farside Investors. In addition, nine other Bitcoin ETFs collectively recorded outflows of $526.8 million, with the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF (DEFI) being the only one to report zero flows, as per preliminary Farside Investors data.Fidelity Records Largest Daily Outflow
Among the ETFs, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) experienced the largest outflow for the day, with $191.1 million net outflows.The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) followed closely behind, with an outflow of $167.4 million. This marks the highest single-day outflow for the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, with the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and Franklin Bitcoin ETF seeing outflows of $98.1 million and $13.4 million, respectively. These outflows coincide with a 10.7% decrease in the price of Bitcoin over the past week.Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, highlighted that the iShares Gold ETF and SPDR Gold ETFs have experienced outflows of $1 billion and $3 billion, respectively, so far this year. Interestingly, despite these outflows, gold has shown a 16% increase year-to-date, as pointed out by Geraci in a recent post.James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, emphasized that the Bitcoin ETFs are still operating smoothly overall, with inflows and outflows being a normal occurrence in the life of an ETF. “Should add — these ETFs are operating smoothly across the board. Inflows and outflows are part of the norm in the life of an ETF,” he wrote on X. Bitcoin Posts Worst Month Since FTX Collapse
Bitcoin has experienced its most challenging month since the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire, as the excitement surrounding US spot Bitcoin ETFs continues to wane. The cryptocurrency’s value plummeted by nearly 16% in April, only slightly better than the decline witnessed in November 2022.The surge in demand fueled by the anticipation of ETFs propelled Bitcoin to an all-time high of almost $74,000 in March. However, as optimism for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts waned and risky investments lost their allure, inflows to these products significantly decreased.The stocks of crypto mining companies suffered more significant declines than Bitcoin itself. Companies like Marathon Digital Holdings Inc., Riot Platforms Inc., Cleanspark Inc., and Cipher Mining Inc. experienced drops ranging from 7.9% to 11%. MicroStrategy Inc., known for its corporate Bitcoin strategy, also faced an 18% tumble after reporting a first-quarter loss of $53 million due to an impairment charge against the value of its Bitcoin holdings.

Crypto firms among ‘greatest risks’ for money laundering in 2022-2023: UK govt

Crypto firms were among those with the “greatest risk” of being exploited for money laundering, according to the United Kingdom’s top financial regulator.In a May 1 report, the U.K. Treasury concluded from data provided by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that crypto-asset companies were among the top four kinds of firms that remained “particularly vulnerable” to financial crime, particularly for cases of money laundering between 2022 and 2023. Crypto firms were listed alongside retail banking, wholesale banking, and wealth management companies.Crypto-asset firms remain vulnerable to being exploited for money laundering. Source: FCAThe report showed between 2022 and 2023, there were a total of 52.8 full-time specialist employees overseeing Anti-Money Laundering cases, with nearly one-third focused specifically on supervising crypto firms. During the 2022 to 2023 period, the FCA’s financial crime specialists conducted a total of 231 reviews of financial firms operating in the U.K. as well as an additional 375 cases related to financial crimes and sanctions. Related: UK regulator to tighten measures against crypto market abuseAs part of a broader supervisory effort outside of these full-time reviews, FCA teams launched a total of 95 cases into British crypto companies.Britain has been working to introduce clearer legislation for local crypto firms with the U.K. Treasury announcing on April 16 that it would aim to present a full regulatory framework for crypto assets and stablecoins by July. On April 26, The U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) and police received expanded authority to “seize, freeze, and destroy” cryptocurrency used by criminals. Under the new rules, police in the country will no longer be required to make an arrest before seizing crypto holdings.U.K. law enforcement can now seize items like passwords and memory sticks that could aid investigations. They have also been granted power to remove crypto assets from being returned into circulation — typically by burning the asset — if it were to be deemed detrimental to the public good.Under the new laws, U.K. police can transfer seized illicit cryptocurrency to wallets under their control, and crime victims can apply to reclaim funds from their crypto accounts.Magazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?

                        Hong Kong’s ZA Bank, a unit of China’s ZhongAn Online P&C Insurance, is reportedly exploring ways to offer virtual asset-related services after new regulations for digital assets launch in June.To establish itself as a crypto hub, Hong Kong implemented a new regulatory framework for crypto exchanges last year. This required all exchanges operating within the city to submit applications for licenses by Feb. 2024. The competition is fierce, with 24 companies vying for these coveted licenses.Approval from Hong Kong’s top financial watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), is highly sought-after, due to its reputation as a prestigious regulatory body.Leveraging this interest, ZA Bank CEO Ronald Iu Man-chung told SCMP in a recent interview that the bank is actively preparing to launch virtual asset trading services for retail investors. However, specific details will be announced only after they finalize preparations, he said.ZA Bank didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.Hong Kong Cracks Down on Unlicensed Virtual Asset Exchanges
The bank’s foray into crypto comes amid a stricter regulatory landscape in Hong Kong. In February, the city’s securities watchdog, the SFC, issued a warning to crypto investors. It urged them to only use licensed platforms and to double-check the registration status of their chosen exchanges.This warning coincides with a critical deadline for Hong Kong-based crypto exchanges. They had until Feb. 29 to submit license applications, or face closure by May 31. The SFC website reinforces this point with a clear message: unlicensed exchanges must cease operations by the end of May.Hong Kong Reboots Crypto Ambitions with ETFs, Regulatory Reform
The SFC has also advised investors to move their digital assets to platforms that are already regulated or in the process of obtaining a license. Currently, only OSL Digital Securities and Hash Blockchain hold licenses for virtual asset trading in Hong Kong. However, there are 24 applicants vying for approval, including names like OKX, HKVAX, Bybit, and DFX Labs.The SFC will also reveal a list of approved and rejected applications for virtual asset trading platforms on a public registry by June 1, 2024.The regulator also recently greenlit Asia’s first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) directly tied to Bitcoin and Ether. These ETFs began trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Tuesday.Hong Kong’s crypto standing took a hit in mid-2022 due to a lack of clear regulations and the rise of competitor hubs like Singapore and Dubai, known for their crypto-friendly stance. However, the city is making a comeback.ZA Bank’s Ronald Iu, highlights the bank’s commitment to supporting the digital asset sector, including Web3 startups, as Hong Kong ramps up digital asset trading through its new licensing program. This program, along with the lifting of the retail crypto trading ban in 2023, signals Hong Kong’s renewed push to become a major crypto hub.

Here’s When Bitcoin Could Halt the ‘Slide’ and Start To Pump, According to On-Chain Analytics Firm Santiment - The Daily Hodl


								The director of marketing at blockchain analytics firm Santiment, Brian Quinlivan, is listing two developments that could ignite a recovery in the price of Bitcoin (BTC).
Quinlivan says in a new video that accumulation by whales and sharks (those holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC) as well as widespread fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) among crypto traders and investors could inspire an upward trend for Bitcoin.










“Since the beginning of the month [of April], these last four-ish weeks or so we’re looking at the whales and sharks actually taking some profit and the price is seemingly following them. 
And until they start to turn it around and resume their accumulation, there can be an argument that we will continue to slide very slowly until either the crowd gets really, really fearful. Like November 2022 was with the FTX [crypto exchange] collapse or the whales just decide ‘you know what, prices are low enough. I’m going to start pumping those prices again.’”
According to Quinlivan, the stock and crypto markets are currently enjoying a directly proportional relationship.
“There is a pretty big correlation right now between crypto and the S&P [500 index]…
The way the Federal Reserve is, the way the inflationary policies have been here in the US at least the last few years have had just a massive kind of impact on the rest of the markets. So until that changes, we have to be conscious of the fact that the way the US stock market has been going lately has had an impact on the way crypto goes. 
And it might be emphasizing a greater drop than crypto otherwise would be seeing on its own if the S&P was stable right now. So that could actually be a positive argument indicating that if the S&P starts to recover, then crypto might see a bit of a relief rebound of its own.”

Arkansas bills reining in crypto miners heads for governor approval

Two bills regulating crypto mining in the American state of Arkansas have fully passed the state’s House of Representatives and are heading to the Governor’s office — the last step before they become law.On May 1, the Arkansas House of Representatives passed Senate Bills 78 and 79 to restrict certain activities relating to cryptocurrency mining in the state, according to reports. Senate Bill 78 imposes noise limits on crypto mining farms, regulates the use of water for cooling, prohibits mining operations from being owned by foreign entities and restores local government control over their regulation. Senate Bill 79 creates a state licensing and regulatory system overseen by the Oil and Gas Commission under the Department of Energy and Environment.The two bills are now headed to Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ desk, which her office has said she will sign into law, the Associated Press reported.The two bills will amend the Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023, which quickly passed in the Arkansas legislature and provided some protections to mining sites.The Act was heavily debated in April when the two bills were initially submitted as it severely limited the ability of local governments to regulate crypto-mining operations, leading to outrage and complaints from impacted rural communities.Local outlet the Arkansas Advocate reported Republican Jeremiah Moore, the House sponsor of Bill 79, said the state has an emerging mining industry adding: “We’ve never seen anything quite like this in our state before.”Related: Bill protecting Bitcoin mining rights passes in Arkansas Senate and HouseSanders’ spokesperson told the Arkansas Advocate the governor “strongly supports outlawing foreign adversaries from owning crypto mines in Arkansas while protecting rural communities and empowering them to crack down on bad actors.” Crypto mining in the United States has become a major point of contention. In April the Biden Administration took a tougher stance against mining operations, citing China as an example for the U.S. to follow.Magazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with ‘Net Zero’ promises

Synethix founder Kain Warwick targets mid-May launch for Infinex DEX

Synethix founder Kain Warwick has “finally” given a date for when the decentralized exchange front-end Infinex is set to go live after several delays from its expected Q4 2022 launch. Infinex is targeting an official launch on May 13, Warwick said on May 2 at the ETH Global conference in Sydney, Australia.Warwick said May 13 would be the “launch of the account” — when Infinex users can access their self-custodial accounts on the platform.Infinex is a noncustodial derivative DEX front-end bidding itself as bringing a centralized exchange user experience.Warwick explained that Infinex would utilize social passkeys to enable users to log in via Web2 applications — such as a Google account — and reduce the “friction” that typically accompanies a standard Web3 user experience. “The core component is you will have an account that you will own — it’s self-custodial — but you will be able to effectively login to that account via Web2,” Warwick said. “The starting point of [Infinex] you can have an account, and then you can deposit into that account to earn governance points,” said Warwick. He added there would be a points-farming game that would run for the month following the launch. On March 13, Infinex suffered a security breach which saw Warwick quickly take over as head of the project’s working group.Source: InfinexSpeaking to Cointelegraph Warwick said the security vulnerability was “part of the reason” Infinex’s launch — initially targeted for Q4 2023 — was delayed. The security vulnerability was a social engineering attack that saw an external security consultant gain access to a password vault, Warwick said. From there the consultant was then able to get into the protocol’s DNS store and modify Infinex’s DNS. Related: Synthetix DEX launch to join efforts reducing the ‘serious friction’ in DeFi“There were no funds at risk because we weren’t live — but just from learning a lesson sort of thing — even prior to being live, that just shouldn’t be able to happen,” he said. “I came in and I brought a couple of other people in and we burned all of the systems to the ground and rebuilt everything from scratch. It’s now one of the most secure environments I’ve ever worked in.”Warwick shared that the May 13 launch date is the proposed launch date that has been provided to the Synthetix protocol’s governing DAO — the Spartan Council — which still needs to vote on-chain to approve the launch.He said he was confident the council would approve — but the decision starts and ends with the council.Following Infinex’s launch, Warwick hopes to see it crack $50 million in total value locked and attract 10,000 genuine users within the first 30 days.“We have 200,000 people on the waitlist but a lot of those are sybils, airdrop farmers and bots. We do think there’s a solid 10,000 [genuine] users on that list,” he said. “If we have 5,000 to 10,000 people and 50 million of TVL — I feel like we’ve done something right.”Warwick added that if the current market cycle were to remain bullish he expects to see “hundreds of thousands” of users join Infinex within a year of its launch.

This Time Its Different, BTC Slump Not Caused by Leverage Flushout: Analyst


																Bitcoin prices slumped to a nine-week low just below $57,000 on May 1, shedding a further 4% on the day. The asset has now bled a whopping 11% since the same time last week.
Market dips and flush-outs are not uncommon for crypto assets, but Glassnode analyst James Check thinks this time is different.
Large derivatives-led deleveraging events were a big feature in the 2021 bull market and have been seen on several occasions this year, the last one in mid-April.
However, Check observed that they did not cause this week’s crypto crash in a post to X on May 2.
Derivatives Not The Cause
“Funding rates have cooled off gradually, not violently, which is very healthy to see,” he said before adding:
“It suggests we didn’t see a massive futures margin call yesterday.”
Funding rates are fees set by derivatives exchanges to maintain the balance between the contract price and the underlying asset price.






The analyst produced another chart showing that Bitcoin futures Open Interest (OI) has declined over the last year in BTC terms.
“This compares OI to market size and shows a relative leverage reduction,” he added.
Open Interest is the number of outstanding crypto derivatives contracts that have yet to be settled.
Check acknowledged that futures markets also saw two significant deleveraging events prior to this sell-off but added, “Again, it doesn’t feel like derivatives were the dominant factor in this Bitcoin sell-off.”
“Rather than a derivatives-led sell-off, I believe this is primarily spot-driven weakness, a result of both short-term sell-side and weaker demand.”
According to Deribit, there is around $1.3 billion in OI for Friday’s Bitcoin options expiry event showing that demand for derivatives remains healthy.
Crypto Markets Bleed
Total market capitalization has declined by over $240 billion over the past week, falling to $2.26 trillion during Thursday morning trading in Asia.
The wider market has shrunk by 22% since its 2024 peak level of around $2.9 trillion.
Technical analyst ‘Rekt Capital’ was unfazed, stating that markets have entered a historically recurring re-accumulation phase.


BTC was trading at $57,469 at the time of writing, while ETH had slumped 2% to $2,920. The altcoins were a mixed bag today, but Binance Coin (BNB) and Toncoin (TON) were seeing larger losses.

                        The UK’s financial watchdog dedicated nearly a third (30%) of its financial crime specialists to overseeing crypto asset businesses in 2023, according to a report released on May 1.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it conducted risk assessments across various sectors and identified retail banking, wholesale banking, wealth management, and crypto-asset firms as especially susceptible to financial crime in 2023. These sectors were deemed the most at risk of being misused for money laundering activities.In its fight against financial crime, the FCA’s team of specialists conducted a significant number of reviews. This included 231 in-depth analyses (desk-based reviews) and seven on-site visits. Additionally, other supervisory teams within the FCA identified 375 potential cases, with 95 specifically linked to crypto assets.Also, the regulator extended a key survey – called REP CRIM – to crypto businesses in April 2022. This comprehensive survey gathers information on anti-money laundering (AML) controls implemented by these firms.Data obtained through REP-CRIM, along with other intelligence reports, allows the regulator to pinpoint risks more effectively and tailor their supervisory actions accordingly.UK Crypto Firms Face Uphill Battle as FCA Registration Process Weeds Out Many
Since Jan. 2020, the FCA has been the AML watchdog for UK crypto businesses like exchanges and custodians. It implemented a rigorous evaluation process for new registrations, uncovering major shortcomings in firms’ anti-money laundering controls. This resulted in many applications being withdrawn, rejected, or refused by the FCA.The FCA’s March business plan highlights its commitment to consumer protection and ensuring a fair crypto market. This includes a focus on strengthening its ability to identify and address crypto market abuse over the next year. Additionally, the FCA aims to promote a competitive UK financial sector within the global landscape.FCA Cracks Down on Misleading Ads
Since intensifying its oversight of financial promotions, the watchdog removed a higher number of misleading advertisements last year compared to 2022.This increased scrutiny follows stricter advertising rules for high-risk investments, implemented in July 2023. These rules include specific guidelines for companies to disclose critical information about crypto products across various online platforms.Further tightening its grip, the FCA issued new guidelines in March this year, targeting financial promotions on social media. This applies to formats like memes, reels, and even gaming streams. The focus is on ensuring fair and accurate information, with no room for misleading content.

Despite these significant movements, experts like James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, reassure investors.

“These ETFs are operating smoothly across the board. Inflows and outflows are part of the norm in the life of an ETF,” Seyffart said.

Additionally, cryptocurrency enthusiasts continue to debate the impact of ETF flows on Bitcoin’s price. Coosh Alemzadeh, a noted Bitcoin investor, argues that the influence of Bitcoin ETFs on market trends is overstated. 

“Bitcoin ETFs are more of a narrative IMO and have less impact on trend than people think.Solana has had “zero” ETF flows and yet has outperformed Bitcoin,” Alemzadeh wrote.


The outflows from ETFs coincided with a dip in Bitcoin’s price, which fell below $57,000 for the first time since February. BeInCrypto reported that this downturn is due to a decrease in demand among crypto whales and spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
The current price of Bitcoin is situated below the short-term holders’ realized price, which lies around $63,000. Traders use this metric to gauge the cost basis of short-term holders’ purchases.
On-chain analysis platform CryptoQuant suggests that Bitcoin’s price might soon find a floor. 

“The $55,000 to $57,000 level is 10% below the current realized price of short-term holders, which has historically acted as the ultimate support during bull markets,” the firm explained.

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) to Surge 7,300% in 48 Hours, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

FBI busts $43M crypto and Las Vegas hospitality Ponzi scheme

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), alongside a New York court, arrested a local resident under the allegations of orchestrating a sophisticated Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of $43 million. On May 1, Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and James Smith, the Assistant Director in Charge of the New York Field Office of the FBI, charged Idin Dalpour with fraudulent activities that included deceptive investment opportunities in a Las Vegas hospitality venture and a cryptocurrency trading enterprise.Dalpour allegedly lured unsuspecting investors with promises of substantial returns, which was nothing more than a facade concealing a large-scale Ponzi scheme.According to the convictions outlined in the FBI indictment, Dalpour solicited investments through an entity under his control, falsely representing its interests in the hospitality and cryptocurrency sectors. As part of the cryptocurrency trading scheme, he claimed that he purchased crypto at wholesale and sold it at a profit to retail investors.Investors were enticed by the prospect of annual returns starting at 42%, coupled with assurances of the safety of their investments through purported insurance and escrow arrangements. Dalpour is alleged to have fabricated contracts, falsified bank statements, and fictitious email correspondence to hoodwink investors into believing in the viability of the ventures. Related: DOJ challenges motion to dismiss Tornado Cash co-founder’s chargesThe FBI says that the investor funds were instead siphoned off to fulfill earlier investors' returns, finance personal expenses — including exorbitant gambling losses — and cover private school tuition for Dalpour's children.James Smith, the assistant director of the FBI, said:“Today’s arrest illustrates the FBI’s dedication to maintaining economic justice and ensuring the actions of one individual are not at the expense of others.”The unraveling of Dalpour's scheme came about when a group of victims confronted him in November 2023. Dalpour then confessed and acknowledged the gravity of his actions, stating, "[w]hat you already have, you have, you can put me in jail now. Like right now."This is one of multiple Ponzi scheme-related arrests with ties to crypto made by U.S. officials in the last year. On March 15, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) busted a $300 million Ponzi scheme under the guise of a crypto trading platform called CryptoFX, which targeted crypto investors from the Latino community in the U.S. and two foreign countries.A few days later, on March 18, a New York jury convicted two individuals who acted as promoters for the now-collapsed fake crypto mining and trading scheme IcomTech.Most recently, on April 4, Irina Dilkinska, the former head of legal and compliance for the multibillion-dollar OneCoin fraud scheme, received a four-year jail sentence after admitting to her role in laundering millions of dollars.

Pike Finance clarifies ‘USDC vulnerability’ statement on $1.6M exploit

The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Pike has clarified its previous statement regarding a vulnerability found in USDC Coin (USDC). The clarification comes after the platform experienced a $1.6 million exploit on April 30.On May 1, Pike published an announcement saying that the exploit was related to a vulnerability on USDC and that USDC’s product offerings had nothing to do with the security lapse that the network suffered.  “This exploit is related to the initial USDC vulnerability that was reported last week on the 26th of April.”However, the DeFi protocol quickly retracted the statement, explaining that the phrase they used did not accurately describe the exploit that transpired. Source: Pike Finance Pike highlighted that the exploit was caused by lapses in its security measures in its contract functions when handling transfers with the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), a service provided by USDC-issuer Circle. Pike clarified that the root cause of the exploit is unrelated to the functionality of Circle’s product offerings.In a previous announcement, Pike Finance said that its auditing partner had already discovered the vulnerability that caused the first hack on April 26, but their team could not address it. They wrote: “It is important to clarify that this vulnerability was previously identified by our auditing partner, OtterSec. Our developer team was unable to address the identified vulnerability in a timely manner.”Pike noted that the exploit resulted from their team’s “improper integration” of third-party technologies like the CCTP or Gelato Network’s automation services. The initial attack led to the theft of $300,000 worth of digital assets. Related: April sees $25M in exploits and scams, marking historic low ― CertiKOn April 30, an attacker used a vulnerability in the protocol’s smart contract to drain about $1.68 million across Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism. In total, the attacker took $1.4 million in Ether (ETH), $150,000 in Optimism (OP) and about $100,000 in Arbitrum (ARB) tokens. Pike recognized that both attacks were due to the same smart contract vulnerability. The protocol said that the misalignment in the contract eventually allowed the attackers to bypass admin access and withdraw funds. Even though hacks still plague the crypto space, data shows that losses in crypto-related hacks showed a sharp decline in April compared to February and March. On May 1, PeckShield reported that losses from hacks in April dropped to $60 million, a steep jump from February’s $360.8 million and March’s $187.6 million.Magazine: Web3 gaming won’t exist in 5 years, $656K for best crypto game pitch: Web3 Gamer

Nigeria’s Patricia Exchange CEO debunks closure rumors

Fejiro Hanu, CEO of Nigeria's first local crypto exchange, Patricia, has denied rumors of its closure, calling them a media ploy for clicks. He affirmed that the exchange is still running.In a post on X, Hanu expressed frustration, stating that despite granting interviews and sharing information with media houses, they distorted the narrative to attract views and fit their agenda. Hanu said:“Good news doesn’t sell as fast as hate/bad news. So everyone is quick to jump on a narrative.”Patricia Technologies came under intense scrutiny following a hacking incident in May 2023, which led to a significant loss of customer funds. Despite claims that customer funds were secure, users have encountered persistent challenges accessing them since April 2023. This lack of access to users’ funds fueled speculation about concerns regarding a potential exit scam, raising fears for customers with funds stuck on the platform.In a recent post on X, Hanu voiced frustration, lamenting that despite providing interviews and sharing information with media outlets, they twisted the narrative to garner more attention and align with their own agenda.Source: Hanu FejiroIn response to customer requests, Patricia converted the value of customer assets into its native Patricia Token (PTK), guaranteeing future repayment. Patricia emphasized its commitment to integrity and customer trust, introducing PTK as an internal customer asset.Patricia stated it is committed to reimbursing holders with 1 USDT (USDT) token for each Patricia token, ensuring asset recovery after the security breach. Patricia clarified that PTK is not on-chain but serves as an internal token representing debt and is managed by the company.Related: Losses from crypto hacks plunge 67% in April to $60 millionIn the post on X, Hanu updated users on Patricia’s status and assured them that major security divisions in the country are actively addressing the situation. Hanu mentioned that they are currently awaiting the prosecution and conviction of the other suspects involved. He emphasized that addressing such cases properly takes time and assured that efforts are underway to resolve the situation.In November 2023, an arrest was made in connection with the Patricia crypto wallet heist. The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) apprehended politician Wilfred Bonse, who was accused of stealing over 200 million naira ($246,153) from Patricia Technologies’ crypto wallet.The NPF said that the case includes criminal conspiracy, the unauthorized alteration of computer systems and network data, and the illicit diversion of funds, as outlined in a petition submitted to the inspector general of police.Magazine: Lazarus Group’s favorite exploit revealed — Crypto hacks analysis

Terraform Labs challenges SEC over unjust $5.3 billion penalty

Terraform Labs and its CEO, Do Kwon, have been confronted with substantive charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the SEC, they have been involved with fraud involving more than $4 billion from unregistered token sales. One of the main types of coins is the cryptocurrency tokens LUNA and UST.UST, an algorithmically issued coin, no longer held its peg to the US dollar, causing the market price to plummet by approximately $40 billion in 2022. Terraform’s legal team, however, has refuted the charges shown by the SEC in general agreement with the penalty sum of about $5.3 billion.Terraform argues against $5.3 billion fineThe height of the conflict came when the jury in New York ruled on April 5, 2024, that both Terraform and Kwon were in the wrong for committing fraud. The last day of the two-week trial ended with a judgment that could bring notable punishment to the cryptocurrency sector. Nevertheless, Terraform’s lawyers believe that most of the UST stablecoin sales took place in countries other than the US. They argue that the SEC hasn’t provided strong enough evidence that there is a link between Terraform’s small operations in the U.S. and the big financial losses indicated.After the sentence, the SEC demands for financial measures, arguing that it will serve as a template for the business. As stated, the commission urged concrete and effective words around explicit wrong conduct in the cryptocurrency field. On the other hand, Terraform lawyers are at least arguing that the penalty is too high and nothing deserves to be deserved, saying that proper financial compensation for clients may be around $1 million.Meanwhile, Terraform’s defense is dependent on the international spread of its business activity. On May 1, 2024, Terraform’s attorneys filed a response arguing the SEC’s lack of authority and insufficient evidence. They argued overwhelmingly that most transactions didn’t occur within U.S. territories, and they deserved no such huge fines under U.S. jurisdiction.Moreover, the defense lawyers justified that position because everything was done in Korea and Singapore. He contended that his role in the allied operations would be the one with the minimum predictable influence on the U.S. operations. In a different filing, Terraform leaped to check the SEC’s narrative by querying whether it was correct. The firm’s legal representatives criticized the SEC’s lack of evidence linking suspected ones to the large scale of losses that the SEC claimed.Grewal highlights compliance in the crypto sectorThe SEC, via its Enforcement Division chairman, Gurbir Grewal, has enjoyed the court’s ruling. Grewal echoed the need for compliance in the crypto industry and just as well referred to the devastating investor losses highlighted in the case of the immediate past. He contended that the decision represents a crucial point for the creator of the regulatory regime targeted on rewarding those who move along the line with the general social good and discouraging the other bad-intentioned actors.This judicial case signifies not only the careful research and precautions applied to the cryptocurrency industry in the US but also an increasing display of due attention and cautious regulations. If the retrial concludes with a ruling that has not yet been decided, the final verdict is expected to shape not only the future of Terraform Labs and its operations but also how other crypto companies will interact with and seek to comply with the regulatory regime, particularly as far as crypto firms’ international operations are concerned.

Bitcoin (BTC) Long-Term Bullish Outlook Is Unchanged


Bitcoin’s (BTC) price was noted to have a considerable drawdown in the last three days, which brought BTC below $58,000. While many consider this to be the beginning of the bear market, it is simply a cool-down.
The mid to long-term outlook for the digital asset is still bullish and Bitcoin will likely validate this in the coming weeks.
Bitcoin Investors Are Still Focused on HODLing
Bitcoin’s price took a hit over the past 48 hours after exhibiting consolidation for the past couple of weeks. The drawdown across the crypto market wiped out nearly $600 million in two days, spooking investors. 
However, looking at BTC on-chain metrics, it seems that this decline was expected, and it is nothing but a short pause in the long-term rally. The Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) over a period of 90 days shows that long-term holders (LTHs) are largely anticipating a further run-up in Bitcoin’s price.

Low levels of CDD recorded mean investors are more likely to either accumulate or be less eager to spend their holdings due to the lower Bitcoin price. This reinforces optimism toward recovery, confirming the recent correction to be merely a market cool-down and not the beginning of a bear market.

Further substantiating this is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The MVRV ratio gauges investor profit or loss. With Bitcoin’s 90-day MVRV at -9.5%, indicating losses, it is likely investors will hold off selling or move to accumulate BTC.
Historically, recovery happens within the -8% to -21% MVRV range, which often precedes rallies. Thus, this zone has been dubbed an accumulation opportunity zone.
If BTC holders act accordingly, Bitcoin’s price could soon see a recovery.

BTC Price Prediction: Bullish Flag Persists
Bitcoin’s price trading at $57,444 is reeling from the drawdown that pulled BTC below $60,000. However, the digital asset is still above the lower trend line of the flag that BTC has been moving in for the past two months.
The flag pattern is characterized by a sharp price movement followed by a consolidation period in the form of a rectangular flag. The breakout from the flag pattern indicates the continuation of the uptrend.
The target for Bitcoin’s price based on the pattern is still $92,505, which would mark a 45% rally above the breakout point. However, the more practical target is a rally above $73,700 to push BTC toward a new all-time high.

This would require Bitcoin’s price to flip the $71,800 resistance into a support floor by first breaching the $68,500 barrier.
However, if BTC holders move to offset their losses and sell their holdings, the cryptocurrency could fall through the lower trend line. This would result in Bitcoin’s price falling below $52,000, effectively invalidating the bullish outlook.

Buy Dogecoin Now? Analyst Believes DOGE Is Primed For A Surge


                            In an analysis shared via X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez elaborated on the ongoing price correction of Dogecoin (DOGE), positing that it is a consistent precursor to major bull runs, drawing on historical patterns to forecast future price movements.
Martinez’s commentary centers on the chart pattern known as the “descending triangle.” This is a bearish formation that occurs when the price follows a downward trendline intersecting a flat support line. Typically, this pattern indicates a continuation of a downward trend, but in the context of Dogecoin, Martinez suggests it precedes significant bullish breakouts.
“The ongoing Dogecoin price correction is part of its usual behavior before massive bull runs! Let’s dive in,” Martinez shared. He explained the historical significance of this pattern in Dogecoin’s trading history: “In 2017, DOGE broke out of a descending triangle. Then, DOGE retraced by 40% before entering a 982% bull run!”

Martinez further analyzed more recent cycles to reinforce his observations, “In 2021, DOGE broke out of a descending triangle again. Then, DOGE retraced by 56% before skyrocketing by 12,197%!” According to Martinez, these retracements are not random but are characteristic of how Dogecoin has behaved in previous cycles, setting the stage for explosive gains.
The analyst drew parallels to the current market conditions: “Now, in 2024, DOGE has yet again broken out of a descending triangle! It is currently undergoing a 47% price correction, very similar to previous cycles, which could ignite the next DOGE bull run!” This assertion suggests that the current market downturn might be an opportune buying moment ahead of potential gains.

Martinez’s analysis underscores the cyclical nature of Dogecoin’s price movements, suggesting a pattern of sharp declines followed by dramatic recoveries. “Over the years, Dogecoin appears to mirror its previous bull cycles! All you need is a little bit of patience,” he concluded.
Short-Term Dogecoin Price Analysis
Amidst this optimistic prediction, the Dogecoin price is in a precarious scenario in the short-term. Since mid-April, DOGE has experienced significant technical resistance. Particularly, the DOGE price was consistently rejected at the 50-day EMA over multiple instances, indicating strong selling pressure at higher price levels.

Amid a broader market downturn, the trajectory was accentuated when Dogecoin’s price broke below the crucial 100-day EMA. This level, often watched by traders for signs of medium-term market direction, had previously offered support. The breach underscores a weakening market sentiment and could signal extended losses.
DOGE price, 1-day chart | Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com
As of press time, Dogecoin’s price hovered near $0.1259 after narrowly holding above the 200-day EMA yesterday, a key psychological and technical barrier. This moving average is now a pivotal point for Dogecoin; its sustained breach on the daily chart could significantly alter the market structure, potentially triggering a slide towards the $0.1005 support level.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 31.63, edging close to the oversold territory but not conclusively signaling an imminent reversal. This indicates that while the market is nearing oversold conditions, the selling pressure has not fully abated. One last leg down might be necessary to get DOGE into “oversold” territory in order to mark a local bottom.

Prominent blockchain sleuth Whale Alert, which tracks down large cryptocurrency transfers, has spread the word about almost two trillion Shiba Inu meme coins leaving Robinhood for an unknown wallet.Two staggering SHIB chunks were grabbed on the popular investment platform and withdrawn approximately eight hours ago. In the meantime, SHIB is eyeing a bullish breakout, according to a popular analyst. In the meantime, almost two billion SHIB were burned in April - mostly by mistake.1.75 trillion SHIB purchased as coin eyes breakoutThe aforementioned source shared that over the past eight hours, mysterious wallet -4D935 has scooped up two enormous chunks containing 875,000,000,000 SHIB each. That is 1.75 trillion SHIB meme coins in total evaluated at $39.2 billion at the time the transactions were made. In the meantime, popular cryptocurrency trader and analyst Ali Martinez tweeted on Wednesday that he has spotted the second largest meme coin, SHIB, forming a bull flag on the daily trading chart.He predicts that SHIB is aiming to make a major bullish breakout to the $0.000072323 level and is placing a few buy orders around $0.000018343 price mark.Over the last 24 hours, SHIB has attempted to surge by more than 9%, reaching $0.00002314.

However, Shibburn clarified that all these burns were not quite the usual ones. All of these tokens were lost forever due to investors sending them to the contract address by mistake.These people have lost their investment, Shibburn emphasized in the tweet, urging the cryptocurrency community to be watchful and double-check the destination wallets before transacting. As for fresh daily burns, within the last 24 hours, the SHIB army has been unable to hold the SHIB burn rate in the green (-11.80%), with 2,027,495 meme coins destroyed.

Bitcoin Selloff Just Getting Started? Gold Bull Peter Schiff Spots Bearish Technical Pattern As BTC Drops Below $60K - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD has been on a downward trajectory since its peak in mid-March, with the decline accelerating in late April. Crypto skeptic and economist Peter Schiff believes the sell-off could continue.Technical Analysis: On Wednesday, Schiff shared a short-term candlestick chart of Bitcoin on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting a technical pattern suggesting a potential bearish trend. He pointed out that the previous support level of $60,000 is now acting as resistance. Additionally, he identified a possible “head-and-shoulders” pattern forming under $60,000, with a neckline around $57,000. This pattern, if confirmed, could indicate a bearish reversal.“The downside objective is $54K,” he posted.Understanding Head-And-Shoulders: A head-and-shoulders pattern is a technical indicator used to identify potential trend reversals. It consists of three peaks: a middle peak (the “head”) that is higher than the two outer peaks (the “shoulders”). A confirmed head-and-shoulders pattern suggests that an upward trend is nearing its end and a downward trend may begin.See Also: How To Buy Bitcoin (BTC)Why It Matters: Bitcoin enjoyed a significant rally following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in late 2021. After a period of consolidation, the price surged to an all-time high of $73,750.07 on March 14th. Since then, it has been in a broad consolidation phase, with a recent downward trend emerging.Federal Reserve Decision: On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain interest rates impacted Bitcoin’s price. The pause in rate hikes strengthened the U.S. dollar, which weakened Bitcoin as it is denominated in dollars. Conversely, future signs of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could translate to Bitcoin gaining strength.Diverging Opinions: While detractors like Schiff take a bearish stance on Bitcoin’s short-term outlook, proponents remain optimistic. Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood predicts a long-term price surge, with Bitcoin potentially reaching $3.8 million by 2030. In the face of this uncertainty, some analysts, like Ali Martinez, see an opportunity to buy the current dip.Price Action: Bitcoin was trading 4% down at $57,630 at around 3 am ET, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin Tops Returns In All Asset Classes Amid ‘Repeatedly Disappointing Inflation Data’: Mohamed El-Erian Shares Insights On Market VolatilityImage via Shutterstock

The US Senator Cynthia Lummis supports Bitcoin regulation

Recently, US Senator Cynthia Lummis has expressed significant concerns about what she perceives as the aggressive attitude of the Biden administration towards regulating Bitcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi). 

Bitcoin and crypto regulation: an important ally in the US Senate
As a strong supporter of digital assets and blockchain technology, Senator Lummis has positioned herself as a key ally for the cryptocurrency community, emphasizing the importance of individual rights in managing digital assets.
Senator Lummis, representative of Wyoming, a state known for its crypto-friendly legislation, criticized the current administration for its approach to regulating the cryptocurrency sector.
His observations highlight a growing tension between federal regulatory efforts and the emerging digital finance industry, which promotes decentralization and minimal regulatory interference.
The Biden administration has been increasingly vocal about the need for a strict regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in order to protect consumers, ensure national security, and maintain financial stability. 
This perspective aligns with global trends in which governments seek to limit the financial risks associated with digital assets, including fraud, volatility, and the potential for use in illicit activities.
However, Senator Lummis argues that the administration’s approach could be overly restrictive and could stifle innovation in an industry known for its potential to revolutionize finances. 
According to Lummis, the right to “hold one’s own keys and manage one’s own node”, which refers to individuals’ ability to manage their cryptocurrency without intermediaries and operate independently on the blockchain, is a fundamental principle that should not be compromised.
The Importance of Self-Sovereignty in Cryptocurrencies
The concept of self-sovereignty is at the core of the appeal of cryptocurrencies. It allows individuals to control their financial assets without the need for banks or traditional financial institutions. 
This not only reduces dependence on these institutions, but also increases privacy and freedom from government control and supervision.
Senator Lummis’ advocacy for self-sovereignty reflects a broader philosophy within the crypto community that values the independence and democratization of finances. 
By emphasizing the right to personal control over digital assets, Lummis is advocating a fundamental principle of decentralized ethics that many in the cryptocurrency space consider sacred.
In her commitment to protect these rights, Senator Lummis has been active in legislative efforts aimed at providing a clearer and supportive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. 
His initiatives aim to bridge the gap between technological innovation and regulatory policies to promote an environment where digital finances can thrive responsibly.
The efforts of the senator are particularly crucial at a time when the cryptocurrency industry is facing significant scrutiny from various government bodies. 
The challenge is to balance the need for regulation to prevent abuses and ensure safety, with the need to allow innovation and personal freedom to flourish.
The Biden administration’s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies will have far-reaching implications for the industry. Effective regulation could provide the clarity and security that could help drive mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. 
On the contrary, excessively stringent regulations could limit the growth of the industry and violate individuals’ rights to manage their digital assets as they see fit.
Conclusions
As the debate continues, the cryptocurrency community watches closely, aware that the outcomes could set precedents that influence the future of digital finances globally. 
The stakes are high, both for the millions of current crypto users and for potential future users who could benefit from a well-regulated, yet innovative and free crypto market.
Senator Cynthia Lummis’ position is a battle cry for those who believe in the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies and who support minimal regulatory interference. 
His commitment to fight for individuals’ rights to control their digital destinies is a significant moment in the ongoing discourse on cryptocurrency regulation. 
As this debate unfolds, it will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of digital finance for years to come, making it a critical issue for all stakeholders in the financial and technological sectors.

Binance: former CZ CEO sentenced to four months in prison

The former CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), has been sentenced to four months in prison. The ruling by Judge Richard Jones is much lower than the 3 years of imprisonment requested by the prosecutors. 

Binance: former CEO CZ and the sentence of four months in prison instead of the requested 36
On Tuesday, Changpeng Zhao (or CZ), former CEO of the famous crypto-exchange Binance, was sentenced to four months in prison in Seattle for violating anti-money laundering laws. 
The sentence has come from Judge Richard Jones of the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington.
Jones seems to have not granted the request for 36 months of imprisonment for CZ, made by the prosecutors. Specifically, the public prosecutors would have stated the following:
“Intentionally violating US laws by Zhao was not an accident or oversight. He made the business decision that breaking US law was the best way to attract users, build his company, and fill his pockets.”
On the other hand, CZ’s defense lawyers had requested probation for him, stating that the former CEO of Binance had repented of his crime and had shown that he had taken responsibility for his actions. 
In this regard, here is the version of CZ’s lawyers:
“Mr. Zhao is a forty-seven-year-old who has committed his first crime. His life has been built on three pillars: devotion to family, the development of technology (particularly Binance) as a force for positive change in the world, and service to the common good.”
Binance: former CEO CZ and Judge Jones’ decision to four months in prison
Despite the versions of the public prosecutors and CZ’s defense lawyers, Judge Jones has decided that the former CEO of Binance will serve four months in prison. 
Specifically, the judge did not agree with the prosecutors’ request for 3 years, simply because it never emerged that Zhao was aware of the illegal activity.

Judge Richard Jones stated that he disagrees with the Department of Justice’s request for enhanced sentencing guidelines that would increase the sentence from 18 months to 3 years: “There is no evidence that the defendant was ever informed” of the illegal activity.
The Department of Justice lawyer argues that the judge should be able to infer that CZ was aware of illegal activities, citing a previous case in which a judge inferred that a defendant was aware of illegal activities.
In November 2023, CZ pleaded guilty for violating the Bank Secrecy Act, agreeing to pay a fine of 50 million dollars and resign as CEO of Binance.
Not only that, since appearing in court in Seattle, Washington, Zhao has not been able to return to Dubai, where his partner and some of his children live. 
The new educational project without involving cryptocurrencies
Meanwhile, last March, CZ launched a new educational project, without involving cryptocurrencies though. It is a new “gamified” platform that aims to provide free education for everyone.
The name of the CZ signed platform is “Giggle Academy”, defined as gamified and adaptive, created with the aim of educating disadvantaged children in developing countries, providing content that covers education from first to twelfth grade. 
Despite CZ wanting to emphasize that cryptos are not involved, he has not been able to exclude NFTs from Giggle Academy. 
And indeed, the new platform plans to make its educational content a gambling game, using a system that includes points, scores, rankings, and NFT badges. In this way, the project aims to become in the future a “learn-to-earn” system.

Switzerland: PostFinance launches its new crypto perfume

PostFinance has announced the launch of its new crypto perfume: “Le Crypt Eau de Parfum”. Available in limited edition, the fragrance dedicated to cryptocurrencies has been created with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

Switzerland: PostFinance launches crypto perfume created with the help of AI
The financial services unit of Swiss Post, PostFinance, has launched its new crypto perfume: “Le Crypt Eau de Parfum“.
Basically, the new fragrance that encapsulates the essence of cryptocurrencies has been created with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
In the demonstration video, the perfumer Uwe Manasse described in detail the method used for creating the crypto perfume, signed by PostFinance. 
First of all, Manasse would have asked the AI what scent cryptocurrencies should have. The answers suggested different fragrances that then became the ingredients of Le Crypt Eau de Parfum. 
In this regard, the AI would have suggested “silver notes” to evoke the idea of currency, “coriander” perhaps to recall the speed of transactions and banknotes, and “lavender” as a symbol of trust towards PostFinance. 
From this suggestion, Manasse then combined the different fragrances adding also musk and milk, to represent the man, and developed the new crypto perfume. 
Switzerland: the new crypto scent from PostFinance available in its branches
From what has emerged, it seems that Le Crypt Eau de Parfum by PostFinance is currently available in one thousand free samples at Swiss Post branches.
The new crypto perfume created using AI, adds to the multiple products and services, and contests, that PostFinance offers to its cryptocurrency-loving customers.
For example, recently, PostFinance had launched a new contest for its customers involving cryptocurrencies.
Basically, through his PostFinance account, if a customer had invested at least $100 in one of the 11 offered cryptocurrencies, he could have won one of the three bitcoins put up for grabs by the Swiss company. 
The competition lasted until April 30th and, in order to award the prize, PostFinance should proceed with the extraction of the future three lucky winners. 
Binance’s marketing move for International Women’s Day
The crypto perfume from PostFinance arrived right after even Binance, the famous crypto-exchange, had launched its “CRYPTO”, in honor of International Women’s Day on March 8th.
Basically, Binance has implemented a marketing move aimed at attracting the female audience to the sector through its new perfume inspired by cryptocurrencies as well.
And in fact, along with the launch of the perfume, the famous crypto-exchange had added a contest dedicated to women. Specifically, Binance had planned to reward the first 5,000 women who completed a crypto course on Binance Academy with a $25 USDT voucher.

Shiba Inu Unveils Two-Phase Hard Fork Strategy For Shibarium


								In the latest issue of the “SHIB Magazine,” the Shiba Inu team has disclosed detailed plans for the upcoming hard fork of the Shibarium network, marking a pivotal milestone in the project’s ongoing efforts to enhance its blockchain infrastructure. This strategic upgrade is aimed at optimizing the network’s performance, increasing transaction processing speed, and preparing the infrastructure for future scalability and broader adoption.
The Shibarium hard fork encompasses a comprehensive upgrade focusing primarily on two core components of its blockchain ecosystem: Bor and Heimdall. These components are crucial for the network’s operation, with Bor functioning primarily as the block producer layer by facilitating the production of blocks in a manner similar to Ethereum’s Layer 1, and Heimdall acting as the validator layer that manages validator committees and stake delegation.
Shiba Inu Team Reveals Two-Phase Strategy
Scheduled for implementation in two phases, the Shibarium hard fork aims to address several key areas:
Phase One – Bor Hard Fork: Slated for today, May 2nd at 2:30 AM EST at a specific block height of 4,504,576, this update targets the Bor layer of Shibarium. It includes critical proposals such as an increase in the calculation of state sync confirmations and a new mechanism to introduce a delay of 128 seconds on state sync confirmation to mitigate issues arising from network partitions.

This issue has been observed when reorg lengths exceed the sprint length, affecting the calculation of state sync events which could potentially lead to errors in node synchronization. The modifications proposed are designed to dynamically calculate state sync parameters to ensure consistency and stability across the network.
Phase Two – Heimdall Hard Fork: Scheduled for the following day, May 3rd at 12:30 AM EST at block height 3,941,864, this update focuses on the Heimdall layer. It introduces mechanisms aimed at achieving deterministic finality in the network, a significant enhancement that ensures the reliability and immutability of transactions once they are confirmed.
The overarching goal of these upgrades is to significantly enhance the network’s efficiency and scalability. By streamlining the consensus mechanisms and optimizing the underlying infrastructure, the hard fork is expected to reduce transaction processing times, decrease transaction costs, and enable the network to handle an increased volume of transactions.
These improvements are critical as they contribute to making the network more accessible and cost-effective, which is particularly important for maintaining competitive edge in the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem.

From a technical standpoint, the upgrades to Bor and Heimdall are expected to involve enhancements to state sync mechanisms and consensus algorithms, which are vital for maintaining network stability and security. These enhancements are geared towards rectifying existing network issues and laying the groundwork for future advancements of Shiba Inu.
Moreover, the integration of features from Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade into Shibarium underscores a strategic alignment with industry standards and best practices, enhancing interoperability with Ethereum-based applications and protocols. This move is anticipated to not only improve the technical robustness of Shibarium but also broaden its appeal and usability across a wider range of blockchain applications.
At press time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) traded at $0.00002203.

Bitcoin ETFs braced a rough trading day on Wednesday.



The funds posted record outflows.



BlackRock’s IBIT fund bled for the first time.
U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) posted record net outflows on Wednesday, with BlackRock’s $15B IBIT fund bleeding for the first time since its launch in January.The development comes as BTC has shed 3.42% in the past 24 hours following a near 17% plunge in April, its worst monthly drop since FTX’s implosion in November 2022. As of press time, the crypto asset exchanged hands at a two-month low of $57,608, CoinMarketCap data shows.Bitcoin ETFs Bleed Over Half a BillionAccording to preliminary data by Farside Investors, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded a massive combined net outflow of $563.7 million on Wednesday, making May 1 the largest single outflow day for the funds.
Fidelity’s FBTC led the day’s outflows, with $191.1 million exiting the fund.

Bitcoin - Time to 'buy the dip?' BTC's price could hike 60% IF crypto... - AMBCrypto



BTC’s key metric has presented a buying opportunity.
However, bearish sentiments remain significant in the market.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) has flashed a buy signal, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has noted in a post on X (formerly Twitter). 
According to the analyst, the token’s MVRV ratio assessed over the 30-day moving average returned a negative value of -11.6%. 
Source: Santiment
This metric tracks the ratio between an asset’s current market price and the average price of every coin or token acquired for that asset. 
When it returns a value above one, it suggests that an asset’s market value is significantly higher than the price at which most investors acquired their holdings. When this happens, the asset is said to be overvalued. 
On the other hand, a negative MVRV value shows that the asset in question is undervalued. It suggests that its market value is below the average purchase price of all its tokens in circulation. 
Martinez assessed the historical pattern of BTC’s MVRV ratio (30d) and found that the last three times the metric dropped below -9%, the coin’s price surged by 64%, 63%, and 99%, respectively. 
According to Martinez, a double-digit rally might be in the books for the leading coin as its MVRV ratio now sits under the critical -9% mark. 
Is a rally feasible?
Readings from the coin’s movements on a daily chart revealed that it broke below support on 30th April, signaling that the bears were in control.
Some of the key technical indicators observed confirmed the significant decline in bullish sentiment. For example, BTC’s Elder-Ray Index has returned only negative values since 24th April.
The indicator measures the relationship between the strength of an asset’s buyers and sellers. When its value is negative, bear power dominates the market.  
Likewise, the coin’s positive directional index (green) rested under its negative index at the time of writing. This showed that selling activity outpaced coin accumulation among market participants.

Regarding demand for BTC, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) trended downward as of this writing. Its RSI was 31.74, while its MFI was 39.71. These values showed that the coin was making its way to the oversold zone of the market.
If selling momentum heightens, the bears may push the coin’s price downward to $52,000 and, subsequently, to $47,000.

EXCLUSIVE: Runes Could Transform Our Understanding Of Bitcoin, Experts Tell Benzinga

With the unveiling of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin BTC/USD is set to make a landmark progression in its technological capabilities, particularly in fungible token issuance. This innovative protocol, created by Casey Rodarmor, is strategically launching in conjunction with the recently concluded Bitcoin Halving event in April, promising to expand Bitcoin’s utility beyond just a store of value.Understanding Runes And Its Operational MechanicsRunes introduces a new token standard that is optimized to reduce the network bloat associated with earlier standards like BRC-20, which congested the network with unnecessary UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). By utilizing a UTXO-based model, Runes ensures that its operations are seamlessly integrated with Bitcoin's existing architecture, improving transaction efficiency and minimizing costs. The protocol employs the OP_RETURN function, allowing for data to be recorded on the blockchain efficiently without impacting transaction outputs, thus facilitating cleaner and more scalable token management.Impact On Bitcoin's Ecosystem And Mining CommunityLennix Lai of OKX Global tells Benzinga that the timely introduction of Runes, which has sparked a surge in transaction activities. This surge is crucial as it mitigates the impact of reduced block rewards from the halving. “Since the launch of our Runes Marketplace, we've seen a significant increase in transactions, which helps compensate miners through higher transaction volumes and fees despite the halving,” Lai explains. This increased activity not only supports the mining community but also bolsters the overall security and robustness of the Bitcoin network.Moreover, the simplicity and efficiency of the Runes protocol are poised to attract a broader range of developers, fostering innovation and potentially increasing the transaction volume and diversity of applications on the Bitcoin blockchain.Darren Franceschini, Co-Founder of Fideum, elaborates on the economic dynamics introduced by Runes, especially concerning Bitcoin’s mining community. Franceschini explains, “Runes enables all sorts of new tokens to be built on Bitcoin. If these tokens become widely used, this would likely lead to a surge in overall transaction volume on the Bitcoin network. As we know, miners get a fee for every transaction they process. So, with more transactions, miners would collect more fees, potentially making up for the decrease in mining rewards.” He uses the analogy of adding new toll roads to an existing highway system to describe how Runes might create new revenue streams for miners, helping to mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards.Also Read: Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETF Debut Records 0.2% Of First-Day US ETF Trading VolumeRunes And The Future Of DeFi On BitcoinEneko Knörr, CEO & Founder of Stabolut, discusses the strategic and functional advancements that Runes introduces to the Bitcoin network. “Runes acts as a bridge, enabling the creation of fungible tokens directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This opens doors for DeFi on Bitcoin, potentially bridging its current gap with Ethereum ETH/USD and Solana SOL/USD in the fungible digital asset arena,” says Knörr. He highlights how Runes’ design addresses limitations of previous token standards by reducing network congestion and elevating transaction efficiency, thus enhancing Bitcoin’s appeal for developing decentralized applications.Post-Halving Outlook And Runes' RoleThe post-halving period is often critical for Bitcoin, with potential implications for its price and market dynamics. The integration of Runes could play a significant role in this phase. The novel applications introduced by Runes could stimulate increased interest and demand for Bitcoin, which, coupled with the decreasing supply due to the halving, might positively influence Bitcoin's price.Furthermore, the introduction of Runes is timed with regulatory advancements such as the acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which could further bolster institutional participation and enhance the overall market stability and growth.Evaluating Bitcoin's Dual Role As A Store of Value And Utility PlatformThe ongoing development within Bitcoin's ecosystem, exemplified by the launch of Runes, is pivotal in shifting perceptions of Bitcoin from solely a store of value to a more versatile platform capable of supporting sophisticated financial applications and systems. This evolution is essential for Bitcoin's long-term relevance and dominance in the cryptocurrency sector.As the Bitcoin community continues to navigate these exciting developments, Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will provide a vital platform for deeper discussions on these topics. Experts will explore the implications of protocols like Runes on Bitcoin’s functionality and its broader impact on the DeFi landscape, offering insights that are crucial for both developers and investors in the digital asset space.Read Next: Consensys Alleges SEC Covertly Targeted Ethereum, Sparking Legal BattleImage created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Bitcoin Dominance Peaked, Says Analyst, Altcoins to Take Charge? | Coinspeaker



Bitcoin market dominance drops fast as BTC price decreases all the way to $56,500. The Bitcoin demand growth and the whale interest have also been on the decline since March end. 

The world’s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin has come under strong selling pressure extending its weekly losses to more than 10%. Soon after the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, May 1, Bitcoin (BTC) price tanked another 5% dropping to the lows of $56,500, before bouncing back partially. Popular crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe recently stated that the “Bitcoin dominance has already peaked” while it’s time for altcoins to shine. “Altcoins start to wake up in their Bitcoin pairs, which means that the rotation is started,” he added.
Usually, a drop in the Bitcoin market dominance signals market participants that an altcoin market rally is around the corner since investors shift their capital from BTC to altcoins. Considering the huge size of the Bitcoin market cap, the BTC dominance currently in the market stands at around 53.9%. This is after the 1.75% drop in dominance registered over the last week. Despite this, the BTC dominance in the broader crypto market is up over 4.6% since the beginning of 2024.




Several market analysts have pointed out the drop in BTC dominance recently. Crypto trader Matthew Hyland noted a significant loss of support in Bitcoin dominance and expressed the intention to await the weekly close before confirming or negating ‘the breakdown’.
Meanwhile, trading team IncomeSharks observed on May 1 via a post on X that Bitcoin dominance is declining, suggesting potential for altcoins to capitalize if price fluctuations persist for several months. They also highlighted the unexpected resilience of many altcoins on that day.”


On-chain Data Hints at Weakness in Bitcoin, $50,000 Coming?
As said Bitcoin price has faced a severe correction under $60,000 as on-chain data shows weakness in Bitcoin demand growth along with the surge in short positions. This shows that one cannot rule out any further downside in the Bitcoin price from here.
According to CryptoQuant’s report, BTC’s recent decline can be attributed to a reduction in demand, marked by a slowdown in the growth of Bitcoin balances among long-term holders, decreased interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, and a rise in short positions in the futures market.
Data from CryptoQuant indicates that demand from long-term holders, defined as investors who consistently accumulate Bitcoin without selling, decreased by 50% in April. Balances went from over 200,000 BTC in late March to approximately 90,000 BTC.

On the other hand, the demand from Bitcoin whales has also been on a decline since March. CryptoQuant notes: “Bitcoin whale demand growth (purple area) peaked at a monthly growth rate of 12% in late March and has now slowed down to 6%.”
Photo: CryptoQuant
According to renowned analyst Scott Melker, the BTC price is unlikely to drop below $52,000 in the short term. Melker noted that despite the correction, which he considers relatively minor for a bull market, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has not yet reached oversold levels.
“This is still only a 23% correction, very shallow for a bull market and consistent with other corrections on this run. We are yet to see a 30-40% pullback during this bull market, like those of the past,” he said.

BTC Went on a Rollercoaster After Fed's Announcement, Altcoins' Recovery Begins (Market Watch)


																After several days of nosediving, bitcoin’s price soared by roughly two grand after the Fed’s refusal to increase the interest rates but dropped back down just as quickly.
The altcoins are in much better shape today, with numerous impressive gains from the likes of Solana, Ripple, Polkadot, ICP, PEPE, and others.
Bitcoin’s Volatility Continues
It was just a couple of days ago when the primary cryptocurrency was trading firmly above $60,000 and was even about to challenge the $65,000 level. That happened in the early Asian trading hours of April 30.
However, it failed to breach that level and started to lose value gradually amid large outflows of US ETFs and the disappointing debut of the Hong Kong-based ones. The landscape worsened on Wednesday as bitcoin slumped further to a two-month low of $56,500, leaving more than $500 million in liquidations.
All eyes were then on the US Federal Reserve in anticipation of its decision regarding the interest rates. As the US central bank said there will be no upcoming hike, BTC’s price jumped by two grand and neared $60,000.

However, it failed to maintain its recovery and dropped back down to its starting position. As of now, BTC stands close to $58,000, with its market cap up to $1.140 trillion. Nevertheless, its dominance over the alts has taken a major hit and is down to 50%.

Relief for Altcoins
The alternative coins suffered just as badly, if not worse, than bitcoin in the past few days, but most have reacted better with more impressive gains now.
Solana is among the top performers on a daily scale. SOL is up by 11.5% and trades above $130. PEPE has soared by 16%, while SHIB, DOT, ADA, XRP, AVAX, MATIC, and ICP follow suit with increases of somewhere between 6% and 12%.
The total crypto market cap has managed to regain around $50 billion from yesterday’s low. As such, the metric has neared $2.3 trillion on CG.

Indian enforcement agency collaborates with Binance to bust scam app

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) — an Indian law enforcement agency — seized 90 crores ($10.5 million) from an online scam app called E-Nuggets with the help of crypto exchanges such as Binance, ZebPay and WazirX.According to a report published by the Hindu, the online gaming app E-Nugget had cryptocurrencies worth $10 million stored in 70 different crypto wallet accounts spread across the three crypto exchanges. The ED contacted these exchanges to block the wallet addresses and transfer the crypto assets to the agency’s wallet.Source: Enforcement Directorate In its report, the ED alleged that the E-Nugget app purportedly offered customers large returns on investment while disguising itself as a gaming platform. The app presented a lucrative investment opportunity with several alluring real-money games that offered large commissions and were designed for users to wager on. However, as soon as money was invested, the app went dark, leaving investors stuck and unable to get their money back. Related: Australia’s top exchange may approve spot Bitcoin ETFs this year: ReportThe agency has attached and seized properties valued at over 163 crores ($19.5 million), including cash, cryptocurrency, account balances and office space.The scam app first came under the radar in 2022 when some of the funds from the company were invested in digital assets. The ED investigation found 2,500 dummy bank accounts 19 crores ($2.2 million) worth of cash was found. The suspected scheme mastermind, Aamir Khan, was arrested along with his accomplice Romen Agarwal and is currently in custody.Since the money was being transferred using digital assets, the law enforcement agencies managed to trace it and subsequently freeze and seize it.Although critics often try to point toward the use of cryptocurrency for money laundering, the nature of the blockchain makes it very difficult to launder the funds once identified. In numerous instances, crypto exchanges have traced and frozen funds linked to criminal activities. The most prominent example of transparency and why it is difficult to launder funds using digital assets dates back to the 2016 Bitfinex hack. Hackers managed to steal 119,756 Bitcoin (BTC) from the crypto exchange. However, the perpetrators behind the exploit were eventually caught and arrested in 2022 while trying to launder the funds.Cointelegraph reached out to Binance and ZebPay for comments but had not received a response by the time of publication.Magazine: Get Bitcoin or die tryin’: Why hip hop stars love crypto

Polkadot Launches JAM Combining Elements of Polkadot & Ethereum


							

Michael van de Poppe acknowledges Polkadot as a promising Layer 1 Blockchain outside Ethereum.



Polkadot Founder Gavin Wood recently released JAM Graypaper, introducing the next generation of Polkadot.



JAM intends to bring Polkadot’s capabilities beyond the existing limitations of Web3.




Prominent crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe acknowledged Polkadot as a “promising Layer 1 Blockchain outside of Ethereum.” In his recent X post, van de Poppe shared insights on Polkadot’s journey from 2016, when Founder Gavin Wood released the Polkadot Whitepaper, till 2024, when he released the JAM Graypaper.







At Token 2048 Dubai, Gavin Wood shed light on the next generation of Polkadot that envisions revolutionizing the future of Web3. As per an official post released by Polkadot, the network aims to “provide the speed, scale, full decentralization, and ease of use needed to drive forward deep innovation across not just Web3, but the entire tech landscape.”



The principal part of the development is JAM, Polkadot chain’s new version, which intends to expand the network’s capabilities beyond Web3’s limitations. In addition, JAM is expected to bring groundbreaking scalability to the network.









Providing more insights into the matter, Wood released a technical Graypaper. In the JAM Graypaper, Wood introduced the basic concept of JAM, stating




“We present a comprehensive and formal definition of JAM, a protocol combining elements of both Polkadot and Ethereum. In a single coherent model, Jam provides a global singleton permissionless object environment…paired with secure sideband computation parallelized over a scalable node network, a proposition pioneered by Polkadot.”




Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT) has managed to escape the bearish track, showing a notable surge of 6.12% in the last 24 hours. However, DOT, currently trading at $6.88, has marked a significant decline of 21% in one month and a marginal decline of 1.04% in one week.

DeFi Lending Platform Aave Reveals V4 Protocol Upgrade Plans | Coinspeaker



With all the upgrades that the proposal suggests, a notable part focused on growing the protocol’s algorithmic stablecoin GHO.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Aave Labs has recently shared what it says is its roadmap for the next five years. According to the firm’s proposal, it seeks to upgrade its protocol to the next-generation version 4 but would love to get community feedback on the proposed venture. However, Aave also noted that the V4 upgrade is only a part of a grander plan for the Aave 2030 grant proposal.
Aave V4: The Proposal
Aave Labs’ proposal, which aims at the complete overhaul of the protocol, will include “major upgrades and expansions” to the Aave Network, says the team. These changes will see the network add a cross-chain liquidity layer, deploy non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layer-1, while also putting on a “fresh new visual identity”.




The team also noted that the Aave V4 upgrade would be featured on an entirely new architecture from the one featured on the previous three versions. However, for a more seamless integration of features such as its native stablecoin GHO, isolation pools, and RWA modules, the upgrade will also add a “Unified Liquidity Layer”.
Another part of the proposal mentions an automated interest rate feature that can adjust based on market conditions. In line with this, Aave says it is actively working with Chainlink to “define a clear set of data feeds”. Then the team also suggested Liquidity Premiums that factors in a borrowers collateral composition and adjusts their borrowing costs in kind.
Hopes for GHO
With all the upgrades that the proposal suggests, a notable part focused on growing the protocol’s algorithmic stablecoin GHO. Since launching in July 2023, the GHO stablecoin has found it really hard competing with the likes of Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). At least, so does its relatively low market capitalization of $49 million suggest.
To this end, the Aave V4 upgrade proposal floated the idea of improving the liquidation engine, such as variable liquidation bonuses and “soft” liquidations. It also hints at adding options to earn interest to boost GHO.
Furthermore, the big upgrade proposes a quick redemption mechanism in the event that GHO depegs. Although the proposal is still new, gathering feedback is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2024. That will then be followed by an on-chain vote. All things being equal, the team expects to roll out the full Aave V4 by mid-2025.
Aave remains the third largest DeFi protocol with a total value locked (TVL) of around $10 billion, per DefiLlama’s data.

Ripple v. SEC court case update as of May 2, 2024


With the cryptocurrency sector at the edge of its seat regarding the final outcome of the courtroom standoff between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple, the regulator has filed its opposition to the blockchain company’s Motion to Strike its new expert materials.
Indeed, after Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn set the schedule for the two sides to argue the use of the SEC’s expert materials, the securities watchdog has filed its opposition to Ripple’s reasoning, according to the X posts by defense attorney and popular commentator on the case, James K. Filan on April 29.

‘Not an expert testimony’
Specifically, the SEC’s legal team’s five-page explanation as to why the court should deny Ripple’s Motion to Strike asserts that the declaration by summary witness Andrea Fox did not constitute undisclosed expert testimony as the blockchain firm argued, stressing that:



“It is not an expert’s report, does not rely on specialized experience, and does not render any opinions at all, let alone an ‘expert ‘ one. Nor does it present the testimony of a percipient witness. Rather, it applies basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records to streamline the presentation of the evidence to Judge Torres.”

Furthermore, the agency highlighted that Judge Analisa Torres had previously already allowed and cited in the summary judgment another SEC summary witness declaration “over Ripple’s identical objection that it constituted an expert report,” referring to the testimony by the SEC’s accountant Christopher Ferrante.
Finally, the securities regulator pointed out that the “Court’s remedies discovery order did not require disclosure of summary witnesses before remedies briefing,” which means that the “SEC did not violate any rule or order by submitting a summary witness declaration,” therefore “Ripple can claim no surprise or prejudice here.”
Recent Ripple SEC news
As a reminder, Ripple had earlier filed a Motion to Strike the SEC’s new witness materials, arguing that Fox’s declaration represents ill-timed “sandbagging,” as well as opposing the $2 billion in damages over institutional XRP sales and arguing that the regulator has failed to prove reckless disregard for the law. 
Afterward, Judge Netburn gave the SEC until April 29, 2024, to file its response to Ripple’s motion, after which the crypto company had three business days to file a response according to the deadline that will be due soon, as per the information that Finbold reported on April 26.
Meanwhile, XRP, the token at the center of the prolonged court case, was at press time changing hands at the price of $0.51331, which suggests an increase of 6.55% on the day, as it moves to reverse the 2.17% loss from across the week and the 13.75% decline from its monthly chart, as per data on May 2.

LayerZero cross-chain interoperability protocol completes first airdrop snapshot

LayerZero, a cross-chain interoperability protocol, is preparing to launch its long-awaited airdrop for users.LayerZero has completed the first snapshot for its upcoming airdrop on May 2, according to an X post by LayerZero Labs that promised followers “more information coming soon.”Source: LayerZero LabsAirdrops are widely employed by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to create more traction by rewarding early users with newly issued cryptocurrencies.LayerZero’s ZRO was the first Hyperp (Hyperliquid-only perp) that launched on HyperLiquid perpetual futures decentralized exchange (DEX) back in September 2023. The ZRO Hyperp trading at $8.3 could imply a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of around $17 billion, according to Xulian, the pseudonymous core contributor of Hyperiquid, in a May 2 X post.Hyperps trade similarly to perpetual futures contracts but do not require an underlying spot or index oracle price. Hyperliquid is the world’s largest perpetual futures DEX by trading volume and Open Interest.Related: Tether nets record $4.5B profit in Q1 2024 — majority from Bitcoin and goldWhile LayerZero Labs shared no additional details about the airdrop, it previously teased that it is preparing for a token launch in early 2024, according to a Dec. 7, 2023, X post:“LayerZero has always been built with the ability to have a native token within the protocol, as can be seen in the immutable code launched on day 1… We’ll state now in no uncertain terms that there will be a LayerZero token. Its distribution is something we’re committed to getting right and expect it to happen within the first half of 2024.”Are airdrops harming DeFi protocols long term?While airdrops aim to create more protocol usage by rewarding early adopters, it’s not always the users taking the lion’s share of the rewards.Crypto airdrops are often riddled with professional airdrop hunters (or squatters) that farm the same airdrop with multiple cryptocurrency wallets with no intention of using the protocol in the long term and market selling the rewards after claiming.In February, pseudonymous Yearn.finance developer Banteg warned that Starknet’s airdrop eligibility list mainly included airdrop squatters. Approximately 701,544 of the 1.3 million eligible wallet addresses were allegedly linked to repeat or renamed GitHub accounts controlled by airdrop squatters.On May 1, Chinese police captured the StarkNet airdrop identity forger, who assumed other users’ identities, claimed over 40,000 STRK tokens on their behalf, and converted it to around $91,000 worth of Tether (USDT).In March 2023, it was revealed that airdrop hunters consolidated $3.3 million worth of tokens from the then Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop from 1,496 wallets into just two wallets they had controlled.Airdrop squatters tend to sell their compounded rewards as soon as they receive the tokens, which usually results in a sharp decline in the newly airdropped token’s value.VIDEOSolana: Expectation Versus Reality.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Creator Pours Cold Water on SocialFi


In a recent exchange on social media, Dogecoin creator Billy Markus, also known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, doused the fervor surrounding SocialFi with a splash of realism. Responding to a post touting SocialFi as the pinnacle of crypto innovation, Markus expressed a pragmatic viewpoint, stating, "I find it interesting when I get money from it and extremely uninteresting otherwise."The term "SocialFi" refers to the convergence of decentralized finance and social networking platforms, promising a revolution in how users engage and transact online. However, Markus's candid response underscores the practical concerns that often accompany such ambitious projects. While some visionaries like Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, advocate for the potential of decentralized social networks like Farcaster, Markus's perspective reflects a more cautious outlook. His assertion hints at the necessity for tangible utility and financial incentive to sustain interest in these emerging platforms.Communications & Social Media Sector by CoinMarketCapDespite the buzz surrounding SocialFi, its current market valuation stands at just over $1.33 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. However, industry analysts anticipate a potential upheaval in valuation as projects like friend.tech gear up for token launches. The imminent distribution of the FRIEND token, expected to exceed a billion dollars, signals a pivotal moment for the SocialFi landscape.Markus's pragmatic stance serves as a reality check for enthusiasts swept up in the hype surrounding SocialFi. While the concept holds promise, its long-term viability hinges on factors beyond just novelty.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Decline, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Advancements, Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions: Bits Recap May 2


																TL;DR

Bitcoin (BTC) experienced another sharp decline, falling to a multi-month low of approximately $56,600.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw its price fall by 13% over the week, despite advancements in its ecosystem and a significant increase in its token burn rate, aimed at reducing supply.
Ripple’s XRP maintained relative stability in a turbulent market, with analysts predicting substantial future price increases based on strong technical signals.


BTC Price Swings
The cryptocurrency market flashed red in the past several days, with vitcoin (BTC) among the heavily affected assets. Its price briefly surged to over $67,000 shortly after the halving but headed south towards the end of April.
It plummeted below the $60K mark on May 1, with the freefall eventually leading to a multi-month low of approximately $56,600 (per CoinGecko’s data).
The bulls witnessed a dose of optimism several hours ago when BTC reclaimed some lost ground, jumping to $58,500. This happened right after the US Federal Reserve announced no additional interest rate hikes at its latest FOMC meeting.




However, the bullish momentum was short-lived, and BTC dipped once again to its current level of around $57,500.
Despite the somewhat grim reality, there are numerous factors indicating that the trends may change soon. Such examples are BTC’s negative exchange netflow in the past week, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric which has experienced a downfall, and the rising open interest (OI) weighted funding rate.
Perhaps the most obvious element hinting that a BTC bull run is still in the cards is the halving that took place last month. Historically, the event has been a precursor of a major resurgence for the asset and the entire cryptocurrency market. Those willing to learn more about its specifics, please take a look at our dedicated video below:
VIDEO
SHIB Developments 
The second-largest meme coin by market capitalization has also underperformed as of late, with its price tumbling by 13% on a weekly scale. On the other hand, it witnessed multiple advancements related to its ecosystem.
As CryptoPotato reported, the SHIB burn rate soared by 90% on May 1, whereas the destroyed assets throughout April equaled almost 1.7 billion. The program’s ultimate goal is to reduce the circulating supply of the meme coin, making it scarcer and potentially more valuable in time.
Shibarium also made the headlines. The layer-2 scaling solution experienced an important upgrade last week and is scheduled to undergo another one today (May 2).
XRP Forecasts
Despite briefly falling below the $0.50 level, Ripple’s XRP remained rather steady during the latest market turbulence. In fact, its price is slightly in the green today and up 3% on a two-week scale.
Numerous analysts believe the asset’s best days are yet to come, envisioning wild targets for the following months. The X user Dark Defender claimed XRP could explode to $5.85 and eventually to a whopping $18.22 as long as it trades above the two major support levels – $0.46 and $0.39.
EGRAG CRYPTO outlined a bullish prediction, too, based on the token’s latest weekly candles that have not dropped below a certain resistance zone.
“Remarkably, not even the body of the weekly candles is closing below the arc, which is incredibly bullish! XRP Army, STAY STEADY! The XRP bulls are showing remarkable resilience, strength, and power in this battle,” the analyst concluded.

Riot Platforms Q1 Earnings Surge as the Stock Price Drops


Riot Platforms, a US-based Bitcoin mining company, recently unveiled a remarkable financial performance for the first quarter 2024. The company announced total revenues of $79.3 million, a noticeable uptick from $73.2 million during the same period last year.
Riot also reported a net income of $211.8 million, earnings per share of $0.82, and $245.7 million in adjusted EBITDA—new highs for the company’s quarterly financial performance. A significant 131% rise in Bitcoin prices, compared to the same three-month period in 2023, largely accounts for this increase.
Bitcoin Price Surge Drives Record-Breaking Quarter for Riot Platforms
Riot’s report revealed that it secured $5.1 million in power curtailment credits. The number is a boost from $3.1 million last year, demonstrating adept management of operational efficiencies.
The Bitcoin Mining segment alone brought in $74.6 million. The number is significantly higher than last year’s $48.0 million, driven by the favorable Bitcoin pricing environment. Conversely, the Engineering segment declined, generating $4.7 million compared to $16.1 million in the previous year.
Riot maintains a robust financial position with $692.5 million in working capital. It also reported $688.5 million in cash and 8,490 unencumbered Bitcoin valued at approximately $605.6 million as of March 31, 2024.
Additionally, the energization of the Corsicana Facility substation was a significant development in the quarter. The facility is slated to be the world’s largest Bitcoin mining facility upon full development.

Besides the Corsicana Facility, Riot also expects its previous purchase from MicroBT in June 2023 to enhance self-mining hash rate capacity. The deployment of these miners has begun and is projected to conclude by the second half of 2025.

“We remain on track to increase our self-mining hash rate capacity to 31 EH/s by the end of the year, which will nearly triple our existing hash rate capacity. With up to 1 GW of total capacity when fully developed, the Corsicana Facility … gives us a strong foundation upon which we will continue scaling our Bitcoin mining business in the future,” Jason Les, Riot Platform’s CEO, stated.

Riot Platform’s Hash Rate Statistics. Source: Riot Platform’s Q1 Report
However, Riot experienced a reduction in its Bitcoin production. Riot mined 1,364 Bitcoins in the first quarter, marking a 36% decrease from the 2,115 Bitcoins produced in Q1 2023.
The downturn in production can be traced back to the soaring Bitcoin network difficulty, which has more than doubled since January 2023. This presents a formidable challenge for miners.
Furthermore, the average cost to mine a single Bitcoin soared to $23,034, dramatically increasing from $9,438 in the previous year. This surge reflects the 89% increase in the global network hash rate over the same period. At the same time, it also presents the escalating operational challenges in the mining industry.

Indeed, the mining sector remains fraught with challenges. The escalating electricity costs and the impending reduction in Bitcoin supply due to the halving event could squeeze operational margins. Regarding the current Bitcoin production cost, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Fund, shared his perspectives.

“This means 1 of 3 things happens now: 1. Price skyrockets, 2. ~15% of miners shut down, 3. Transaction fees remain a lot higher on average,” Edwards wrote while admitting he is “expecting a bit of all three.”

In response to the latest outlook, analysts see some miners might diversify their business into emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Analysts consider this shift a strategic move to mitigate the risks of the volatile crypto market while leveraging their computational power beyond crypto mining.
However, a January 2024 study by CoinShares suggests that miners with substantial Bitcoin reserves and robust capitalization are better positioned in bullish markets. In contrast, those with limited cash reserves and high operational costs per Bitcoin face heightened risks.

Riot’s strong performance in Q1 has yet to affect the company’s stock price positively. The stock price has decreased by 11.77% over the past five days.

The broader timeframe presents a similar picture, with RIOT down 36.28% from its year-to-date peak price of $17.62. At the time of writing, RIOT’s price is $9.82 during after-hours trading.

Bitcoin dumps 'bull market excess' as daily ETF outflows pass $500M

Bitcoin (BTC) did not see a “massive futures margin call” as BTC price action plumbed two-month lows, analysis says.In a thread on X (formerly Twitter) on May 2, Checkmate, the lead on-chain analyst at blockchain data firm Glassnode, revealed a key change in the Bitcoin bull market.Analysis: Derivatives not "dominant" in BTC price sell-offBitcoin may have shocked some with its move to $56,500 on May 1, but in broader terms, this bull market pullback appears cathartic for market health.As Checkmate shows, a gradual “de-leveraging” across Bitcoin futures has been ongoing since Bitcoin’s latest all-time highs in mid-March. This, he argues, is putting an end to “bull market excess.”“For those of you around in the 2021 Bitcoin bull market, you will remember the massive derivatives led deleveraging events which killed it,” part of one post stated.“Are we seeing a derivatives led flush out today? I don’t think so.”An accompanying chart compared the comedown from Bitcoin’s trip to $58,000 during Q1 2021.BTC/USD chart with funding rates data. Source: Checkmate/XCheckmate referenced continued flat funding rates across derivatives as a clear distinguishing factor between the market now and three years ago.“Funding rates have cooled off gradually, not violently, which is very healthy to see. It suggests we didn't see a massive futures margin call yesterday,” he wrote.With that, attention turned to other sources for the latest BTC price cascade downward — one which at the time of writing had failed to recover much beyond the lows.“Futures markets also saw two statistically significant deleveraging events prior to this sell-off,” the thread noted alongside a chart of the 7-day change in Bitcoin futures open interest levels. “We did hit two overheated points on the rally into the $73k ATH, but it cooled off quickly. Again, doesn't feel like derivatives were the dominant factor in this Bitcoin sell-off.”Bitcoin futures open interest 7-day change chart.

Jesper Johansen, Founder and CEO, Northstake
Scott Lawin, Co-founder CEO, Candy Digital
Yuri Yurchenko, Chief Product Officer, Neon EVM
John Lilic, Executive Director, Telos Foundation
Sam MacPherson, Co-founder, CEO Phoenix Labs
Karel Kubat, Founder, Union
Alex Goh, Founder and Chairman, EMC Foundation
Thomas Messerer, CEO, Silencio Network
Veronica Wong, Co-founder and CEO, SafePal.
You can find each interview on the links above to watch, and you can read what these industry insiders exclusively told Matt below.Casper-IBM Governance Tool MVP Coming Soon
Alizee Carli, Director of Ecosystem at Casper Association, the team behind the Casper blockchain, remarked that all interactions will AI will have to be fully auditable by 2025 to comply with the incoming EU regulations.Blockchain is an excellent solution for that.Therefore, Casper Labs and IBM are working together on a governance tool, and the MVP will be launched in the third quarter of this year.Meanwhile, the Association’s ” big focus ” is real-world asset tokenization (RWAs).They want to expand tokenization, particularly with cash, cash equivalents, and other financial products.The team has spent the last 18 months bringing RWA tokenization protocols on Casper, including a native stablecoin launching in May.VIDEOCrypto Market Cap ‘Splitting in Two’
Speaking of RWAs, some are also turning to tokenizing staking.This is a way to tokenize validator node infrastructure, said Jesper Johansen, CEO of regulated custodial staking provider Northstake, which pioneered this method.This means that it can be traded in the secondary market.A key point here is that this is not a derivative, which is especially relevant from a regulatory perspective, Johansen said.This is a way for the company to increase capital efficiency in regulated funds such as ETFs.He said that, in connection with that, the crypto market cap is splitting into two currents now: the permisionless, decentralized crypto on the one hand and the regulated crypto on the other.Northstake has recently launched a pilot with 3iQ, CoinFund, and CoinDesk Indice, while the mainnet is expected later this year.Tokenizing Trade at TOKEN2049
Commenting on the DeFi developments and expectations, Sam MacPherson, CEO of research and development shop Phoenix Labs, noted that one of the biggest recent events has been the launch of Ethena.Furthermore, Maker is “LPing into Ethena at a large scale.”This has resulted in a tokenized cash-and-carry trade, which is a significant new development in the RWA space.VIDEOBanking Crypto
Veronica Wong, Co-Founder of SafePal, a non-custodial wallet serving more than 12 million users, said that the company is in the process of making new partnerships, as well as focusing more on the Asia-Pacific market.SafePal recently launched a completely compliant, smooth, crypto-friendly on- and off-ramp in cooperation with Swiss bank Fiat24.This allows users to open a Swiss bank account within 10 minutes and top up using crypto or fiat, paired with a Visa card to allow spending and transfer.This has solved “a lot of pain points” for users, Wong said.‘No’ to Network Congestions
According to Yuri Yurchenko, Chief Product Officer at Neon EVM, the only EVM on Solana, applications can benefit from this team’s product in various ways.A major one is parallel execution, solving the issue of congestion for applications.The users benefit the same way, Yurchenko said. No matter what they do, be it trading on DEXes or interacting with games, they will not be disturbed by network congestion.VIDEOEntering Web3 Through Games, NFTs, and Digital Engagement at TOKEN2049
Scott Lawin, CEO of Web3 fan engagement platform Candy Digital, told us that the team is entering the gaming space and will launch a mobile game globally this summer.The big focus there is not just on NFTs as collectibles or speculative assets but on their utility and ability to be used in different ways.Just recently, the team announced the partnership with the game-developing giant Kakao Games.Furthermore, Candy uses ticketing and NFTs to onboard people to Web3. The company’s aim has been to make this process easy.Additionally, through sports partnerships, Candy has enabled fans to get rewarded for these digital engagements. This brings people into Web3 and builds a loyalty program at the same time, Lawim said.Moving from Frankenstein ZK
John Lilic, Executive Director at Telos Foundation, said that Telos initiated the development of a hardware-accelerated zkEVM Layer 2 (L2) network in collaboration with Ponos Technology.“A lot of the ZK stuff right now is kind of slow. It’s a little bit of a patchwork of Frankenstein components. [There are many] compromises because it’s very, very hard to make this stuff work.”And because ZK is so difficult to have working efficiently, it’s key to think about both hardware and software sides from the start – it’s a more “holistic approach.”Telos is focused on the hardware part because this “can help inform the way you build your software.”That way, the hardware can accelerate the software.VIDEOUniting the Layers

Alex Goh, the founder of the EMC Foundation, said that this team’s goal is to integrate AI with Web3 technology.Among other things, the team is working on decentralized AI, RWA, and GPU-based DePin (decentralized physical infrastructure network).One of the foundation’s visions is that everyone should be able to participate in building AI—it shouldn’t be run by a single entity.“We’re envisioning an open-source, large model [that] can be run in a decentralized fashion followed by a set of GPUs” that are distributed and run by GPU-as-a-service provider, “and they all come together to power the application of decentralized AI.”VIDEODePIN Excels at Creating Value
Thomas Messerer, CEO of Silencio Network, is envisioning a future where a billion people will be using their product in a way they’re using weather apps, for example.The reason the team chose the DePIN route to accomplish their goal is because it “excels at creating value.”Compared to Web2 counterparts, said Messerer, Silencio is providing more value and growing “20x faster.”Additionally, the DePIN model creates communities that accompany this vision, enabling the team to crowdsource data – “mapping out a size of Paris on a daily basis.”Notably, the app has about a 75% retention rate on a monthly basis.

Bitcoin halving sees Bitfarms’ BTC mining earnings plummet

The impact of the fourth Bitcoin halving has led Bitfarms to report its lowest monthly earnings in over two years.The mining firm earned 269 Bitcoin (BTC) in mining rewards and transaction fees in April 2024. The company is undergoing a $240 million upgrade for its Bitcoin mining equipment in an effort to remain profitable amid permanently reduced rewards.Bitfarms monthly BTC earnings in 2022 and 2023.

Bitfarms’ April production update shows that the company improved its corporate energy efficiency by 9% to 31 watts per terahash (w/TH).In addition to its 269 BTC monthly earnings (roughly $15.5 million), Bitfarms expects a $23.7 million value-added tax (VAT) refund from Canada. Sharing an update on its fleet upgrade, Bitfarms chief mining officer Ben Gagnon said:“In April, we fully upgraded two farms in Québec (Canada) with Bitmain T21 miners, improving energy efficiency by 51% at those farms and 9% on a company-wide basis.”The Bitcoin halving resulted in a 5.9% increase in network difficulty compared to March, further impacting the earnings of all miners. For Bitfarms, ongoing turbine maintenance in Argentina further temporarily lowered its monthly mining capacity.Related: Arkansas bills reining in crypto miners head for governor approvalThe April earnings of 269 BTC for Bitfarms were 6% lower than the previous month and 29% lower year-over-year.Considering that Bitfarms earned 9 BTC per day, its daily earnings amounted to roughly $551,700, based on a BTC price of $61,300 on April 30, 2024.In the first three months of 2024, Bitfarms earned 357 BTC, 300 BTC and 286 BTC, respectively.

Bitcoin post-halving price consolidation could last 2 months - Bitfinex

According to analysts at cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, Bitcoin could experience up to two months of price consolidation following the halving.The latest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha market report notes that Bitcoin (BTC) could continue to be the price action benchmark for the crypto market in May and the leading indicator for the entire cryptocurrency market cap.According to the report, the macroeconomic environment is more resilient than in previous years and the likelihood of rate cuts remains low in the short term. Furthermore, the analysts said that general consumers and businesses are “better prepared and informed” about the state of the underlying economy when compared to previous crypto market cycles:"Consequently, we believe we could see a 1-2 month consolidation in Bitcoin prices, trading in a range with swings of $10,000 on either side.”The report adds that any positive impact on Bitcoin’s price following the halving, which has reduced the supply of new BTC to the market, will be seen in later months.“At this point, the economy is also expected to be performing better, having achieved a soft landing and avoiding a recession, providing further impetus to crypto assets,” the analysts wrote.Related: The reasons Bitcoin price is down 11% since the halvingVarious cryptocurrency traders are offering similar views on Bitcoin’s recent consolidation from its all-time highs over a month ago.

Crypto trader Matthew Hyland echoed this, highlighting that Bitcoin market dominance is losing major support.The Bitfinex Alpha report also dived into technical details of Bitcoin’s dropping market dominance. It notes that Bitcoin halvings historically see attention shift toward altcoins which rally and gain market share. Bitcoin’s dominance chart over the past month.

Ethereum dips, but demand rises: What's driving investors to ETH? - AMBCrypto



ETH saw the biggest 2-day stretch of network expansion since October 2022.
The addresses holding between 0 and 0.1 units of ETH increased significantly.

Ethereum [ETH] continued to fall freely, sinking below $3,000 in the last 24 hours following a 3% drop, data from CoinMarketCap showed. The second-largest cryptocurrency was trading at $2,914 at press time, reflecting a 13.34% discount over the month.
The negative price action, however, did not appear to limit demand for the asset.
Unfazed users continue to snap ETH
According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Ethereum saw a sharp increase in new users joining the network. About 266.6k new wallets were created on the 28th of April and 29th, the biggest 2-day stretch of network expansion since October 2022.
Source: Santiment
Network expansion is one of the primary measures for determining if a cryptocurrency is gaining or losing traction. The onboarding of new users indicated confidence in ETH’s long-term potential, ignoring short-term blips.
Retail users enter ETH market
On further scrutiny, it came to light that retail users were jumping on the bandwagon. The addresses holding between 0 and 0.1 units of ETH increased significantly while the prices plunged, as per AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data.
Source: Santiment
Interestingly, the cohorts holding more than 1 ETH were selling off, as evident in the drop in their ETH reserves.
Source: Santiment
The aforementioned findings suggested that retail interest was strong for ETH and healthy inflows from this segment could contribute to a relief rally in the days ahead.

Is staking the driving force?
Many of these retail customers buying ETH might be lured by the yields offered by ETH staking services.
The total ETH staked soared to 44.24 million as of this writing, forming 36% of ETH’s total circulating supply, AMBCrypto noted using Glassnode data.
At the same time, the supply of ETH on exchanges continued to shrink, falling to 12.79 million as of this writing, about 10% of total ETH coins in circulation.

Aave Labs Unveils Plans to Upgrade its Protocol to Version 4


							

Aave Labs has unveiled plans to upgrade its protocol from V3 to V4.



The Aave V4 roadmap is part of a wider “Aave 2030 grant” proposal.



The timeline for the Aave V4 development is scheduled to run from Q2 2024 until mid-2025.




Aave Labs, the blockchain firm behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Aave, has unveiled plans to upgrade its protocol. The proposed upgrade would lead to the launch of Aave V4, with a new architecture that would introduce novel capabilities to the protocol.



According to the firm’s announcement, Aave V4 would enhance modularity, reduce governance overhead, optimize capital efficiency, and integrate innovations such as the Aave-native stablecoin GHO more seamlessly. 



Although the Aave V4 roadmap is in an advanced research stage, the blockchain firm proposes to develop it as part of a wider “Aave 2030 grant” proposal. Aave is adopting a transparent model of development involving the project’s community throughout the feedback and testing phases.



Meanwhile, Aave Labs has scheduled a timeline for the Aave V4 development to run from Q2 2024 until mid-2025 when it fully releases the protocol. According to Aave Labs, it will act as the technical contributor, while the Aave DAO will deploy all code bases made available by Aave Labs and other contributors.









In a recent post on X, the blockchain firm classified Aave V4 as a significant advancement in DeFi. According to the post, the upgrade will establish new frontiers, including capital efficiency, risk management, and scalability. The Aave V4 development is coming about two years after launching the current iteration, Aave V3, on several networks. The current version went live on the Ethereum mainnet in early 2023.



Aave Labs considers its project the largest DeFi protocol, excluding (re)staking. It noted that the protocol has experienced considerable growth in both user base and total value locked (TVL) since it launched in 2022. As of Aave Labs’ announcement, Aave had an average market size of $17 billion and was available on over twelve networks.

Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs not enough to absorb US ETF selling pressure

The inflows from the recently launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong are not enough to cover the outflows from the 11 United States-based spot Bitcoin ETFs.So far, the Hong Kong ETFs saw $217 million worth of net inflows this week, according to a May 2 X post by James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares.The inflows are less than the $298 million worth of net outflows generated by the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs this week, according to Dune.Flows by exchange country. Source: James ButterfillInstitutional inflows from ETFs were a significant part of the current Bitcoin rally to new all-time highs. By Feb. 15, Bitcoin ETFs accounted for about 75% of new investment in the world’s largest cryptocurrency as it surpassed the $50,000 mark, according to CryptoQuant research.Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund accounted for the majority of May 1 outflows, selling over $191 million worth of Bitcoin.

Source: FarsideThe first batch of Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ether-based ETFs launched for trading on April 30, creating excitement among crypto holders. However, trading activity has been disappointing. The Hong Kong-based ETFs only amassed $12.4 million in trading volume during the first day, which pales compared to the first-day trading volume of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, valued at $4.6 billion.However, this is a high figure considering the size of the Hong Kong market, equivalent to $1.6 billion worth of trading volume in the United States, according to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas’ April 30 X post:“You have to understand [that Hong Kong] is 1/168th the size of the U.S.”While the inflows were relatively small, the debut of the Hong Kong ETFs could set a significant precedent for other jurisdictions, according to James Wo, the founder and CEO of DFG, who told Cointelegraph:“These ETFs open up Asian markets to crypto exposure, which can likely push prices up in the long term as more countries likely follow the footsteps of Hong Kong as well."Related: Bitcoin down 20%+ from all-time highs — Is BTC price headed to $50K?Could Bitcoin revisit the $50,000 mark after the Hong Kong ETF debut?The debut of the first Hong Kong ETFs proved to be a “sell-the-news” type event for Bitcoin holders, as BTC fell below the $60,000 psychological mark on May 1, a day after the debut of the new ETFs.The last time Bitcoin traded below $60,000 was at the end of February, according to CoinMarketCap.BTC/USDT, 1-day chart.

He told Cointelegraph:“While price predictions are not appropriate based on these, the STH-RP is a crucial support level for BTC to hold and on losing it, or the average ETF buyer cost basis, there is a high likelihood that there is a cascade down to low $50,000s.”Related: Tether nets record $4.5B profit in Q1 2024 — majority from Bitcoin and gold

Opportunity? DOGE set for imminent bull run


As the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency sector resume their trading in the green, Dogecoin (DOGE) is no exception, and its recent price correction might have just been in preparation for an upcoming massively bullish rally, according to the market’s renowned expert.
Indeed, professional crypto trader Ali Martinez has suggested that the previous price correction of Dogecoin was just “part of its usual behavior before massive bull runs,” as per the analysis and chart pattern observations he shared in a X thread on May 2.
Specifically, the analyst highlighted that DOGE’s breaking out of a descending triangle pattern in 2017 preceded a 40% retracement before the popular doge meme crypto asset continued to kickstart an earth-shattering 982% bull run in the months that followed.

Then, in 2021, DOGE performed a similar price action again, this time around retracing by a more significant 56% before proceeding to make a face-melting advance of 12,197%, which saw it skyrocket from a mere $0.0002 to the area around a whopping $0.0245.

Recently, DOGE has repeated the price action of breaking out of a descending triangle once again and is “currently undergoing a 47% price correction, very similar to previous cycles, which could ignite the next DOGE bull run,” as Martinez stressed.

Meanwhile, the eighth-largest asset in the crypto market is presently trading at the price of $0.12833, which suggests an increase of 3.58% on the day, as it moves to reverse the loss of 14.28% from its weekly chart and the 30.74% dip accumulated on its monthly chart, according to the most recent data obtained on May 2.

All things considered, Dogecoin could, indeed, be on its way to a massive bull run that could even overshadow the previous two occasions when it performed similar price action. However, things in this sector can sometimes make surprising twists, so doing one’s own research is critical before investing.

Bitcoin (BTC) 'Call Writing' Back in Vogue as Cash And Carry Strategy Loses Shine

Bitcoin fell as low as $56,600 Wednesday, diving out of a four-week consolidation between $60,000 and $70,000 due to several factors, including dwindling demand for spot exchange-traded funds and a resurgent dollar index.

Bitcoin Price Drops Reflecting Fed's Financial Policy Impact


							

Bitcoin’s price drop indicates its role as a leading indicator of market risk sentiment and liquidity dynamics.



The Federal Reserve’s tightening stance heightens Bitcoin’s volatility, stirring concerns about market stability. 



Bitcoin’s value mirrors macroeconomic factors; potential relief may arrive if inflation eases and the Fed embraces a more accommodative approach.




Bitcoin’s recent price decline has drawn attention, with its volatility potentially signaling broader shifts in global market risk appetite. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, over the past two days, the cryptocurrency has dropped about 4%, following a significant 16% decline in April, marking its worst monthly performance since November 2022, when FTX, the digital-asset empire of Sam Bankman-Fried, faced a collapse.



Currently trading around $57,505.60, Bitcoin is at a two-month low and has dropped by 4.01% in the past 24 hours. Investors often analyze Bitcoin’s price movements for insights into changing liquidity dynamics that can impact other assets. The recent slide coincided with the Federal Reserve’s indication of keeping interest rates higher for longer, which tightened financial conditions by boosting Treasury yields and the dollar.



Charlie Morris, Chief Investment Officer at ByteTree Asset Management, referred to Bitcoin as a “favorite canary,” suggesting it serves as an early warning signal for financial market troubles, but also noting that it typically rebounds eventually. Morris highlighted the recent strength of the US dollar as a potential indicator of forthcoming market tightness.



Bitcoin’s record high of nearly $74,000 in mid-March was driven by a surge in inflows into debut US spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from major institutions like BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments. However, the demand for these products waned, and this week’s launch of spot-Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong failed to provide a boost. Discounts to net asset value for some US portfolios have widened to record levels, underscoring the challenges posed by Bitcoin’s volatility.










Historical data compiled by Bloomberg shows that Bitcoin has posted four April declines over the past decade, with three of them preceding May losses averaging 18%. Despite these trends, if inflation pressures ease and markets anticipate a more accommodative Fed stance, cryptocurrencies and other speculative investments could experience some relief.



As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a possible rate reduction this year, he also acknowledged persistent inflation concerns. This suggests that the market will closely monitor inflation, employment, and economic data in the coming months for any unexpected developments that could impact potential rate cuts.

Why BlackRock Invested $47 Million in This RWA Tokenization Firm


BlackRock has spearheaded a $47 million investment round for Securitize, a firm focused on tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). 
Announced on May 1, this strategic infusion of capital marks a crucial step in the evolution of digital asset securities.
How Securitize Plans to Use $47 Million Funding
Securitize is set to use this funding to propel product development, expand internationally, and enhance partnerships across the financial industry. Investors in this round include Hamilton Lane, ParaFi Capital, and Tradeweb Markets, alongside other key players such as Aptos Labs, Circle, and Paxos.
Consequently, Joseph Chalom, BlackRock’s Global Head of Strategic Ecosystem Partnerships, will join the Securitize Board of Directors. 

“In our view, the transformative potential of blockchain technology to reshape the future of finance in general – and tokenization in particular – is promising,” Carlos Domingo, the co-founder of Securitize said.

In March, BlackRock partnered with Securitize to launch its first tokenized fund on Ethereum, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). This fund offers a stable $1 value per token and distributes dividends directly to investors’ wallets as new tokens monthly. 
Investing primarily in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, the fund aims to provide yield while maintaining liquidity on the blockchain.


“The focus here is on institutional use of RWAs, and it makes perfect sense for a firm like Blackrock, who already transacts in the RWAs, to find a “large enough” actor they could trust to tokenize those assets and step into the sector. Also interesting to see the mix of investors who joined them in the round. They represent a really strong signal that Tokenizing RWAs is not only becoming mainstream, it’s where the big, smart, industry, and trendy money are all going,” D.J. Bodden, Operations Director at Storm Partners, told BeInCrypto.

BeInCrypto reported that BUIDL has become the world’s largest treasury fund tokenized on a blockchain as of May 1. It surpassed Franklin Templeton’s Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund in market capitalization. 
Since its launch six weeks prior, BUIDL has swiftly attracted market attention, with its market capitalization skyrocketing from $274 million to $375 million in April, an impressive 36.5% increase.
This surge aligns with a wider trend towards debt-based, high-yield investments. As of April 26, the total value locked in tokenized real-world assets reached a record $8 billion, marking a nearly 60% rise since February. These statistics exclude fiat-backed stablecoins and cover various assets, including commodities, securities, and real estate tokenization protocols.

Europe's Second Largest Bank Announced That It Is Investing in Bitcoin! - Bitcoin Sistemi


The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin has been declining since April. BTC, which started May with a decline, continues to decline due to many factors.
While the effect of successive outflows in spot Bitcoin ETFs undoubtedly played a major role in this decline, BNP Paribas, the second largest bank in Europe, reported that it was exposed to the spot BTC ETF in its last 13F filing.


Accordingly, BNP Paribas stated that it has invested in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).
According to the notification made yesterday, BNP Paribas announced that it invested $41,684 in the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF by purchasing 1,030 units.





Although the investment in the Bitcoin ETF was not large, it was considered a big step in the bank's adoption of BTC.
Analysts also stated that this move of the bank coincides with the post of Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Because Eric Balchunas said that many investment advisors, banks and other institutional investors have invested in BTC ETFs, but they have not yet reported and disclosed these investments.


Balchunas also stated that he expects more than 500 investment advisors to disclose their Bitcoin ETF holdings by May 15, the deadline for 13F filings.

Bitcoin Could Undergo a ‘Little Bit Bigger of a Drop’ if Indicator That’s Acted as Support Flips: Benjamin Cowen - The Daily Hodl


								Widely followed analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that Bitcoin (BTC) could fall further after the flagship crypto asset hit a low last recorded in February.
Cowen tells his 801,000 YouTube subscribers in a new video that Bitcoin could experience more downward pressure if the price falls below the 100-day simple moving average (SMA).










“In the short term the thing to keep an eye on with Bitcoin is going to be your 100-day moving average because that is where we are right now. We just swept these lows [at $60,000]. So that’s what I would keep an eye on.
The 100-day SMA has been somewhat of a support here a couple of times… so you know if the bulls are going to try to hold, I imagine they’re going to try to make it stand here…
If they don’t hold it then your next area that you’re going to look at is going to be your bull market support band. And that’s all the way down at around $55,500 to $56,200. So that would be a little bit bigger of a drop.”
Source: Benjamin Cowen/ YouTube
Bitcoin is trading at $57,943 at time of writing, down by around 22% from the all-time high reached on March 14th.
On whether Bitcoin is likely to reach an all-time high earlier than in previous cycles (left-translated peak) or will similarly witness an all-time high to previous cycles (normal peak), Cowen says,
“There’s a lot of sort of academic discussions between left-translated peak or normal peak…
what if this just ends up being sort of a mid-cycle top that’s just occurring a little bit later because rate cuts are a little bit later, we cool off for a while and we just pick back up in the post-halving year? Definitely an option.
If that doesn’t happen and we just pick up now then I would start to believe more so in the left-translated peak idea.”

CZ’s Trial Outcome Shows Cooperation Pays Off


							

Changpeng Zhao’s admission of guilt has paid off in his trial.



A report states that Zhao’s cooperation during the trial led to reduced sentencing.



CZ faces a four month jail term, while prosecutors wanted a three-year term.




The trial of Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ in the digital asset space, brought out the fact that cooperation plays a big role in the results. It is important to note that the crypto entrepreneur was sentenced to 4 months in prison. 



As per a report from CoinDesk, United States District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle noted that the billionaire’s contributions to charities were coupled with his willingness to accept responsibility while downplaying the fact that he had anything to do with the crimes being committed at Binance. 



The sentencing is more than CZ’s lawyers asked for while being significantly less than the one suggested by the US prosecutors. Prosecutors sought a 3-year jail term, while CZ’s lawyers wanted a mere house arrest. 









Zhao gets to keep his vast stake in Binance and also maintain his vast wealth. Better Markets co-founder Dennis Kelleher stated that the short sentencing proves that “crime pays,” while DOJ attorney Kevin Mosley agreed:




“Breaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.”




Notably, dozens of letters were written in support of Zhao, describing him as a family man. The former Binance executive has led a mostly private life and has a college-age son, who sat beside his mother and nephew during the sentencing.Additionally, CZ emphasized his guilt multiple times during the course of the trial and his inability to correct the wrongdoings at Binance. On the other hand, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, never offered “a word of remorse for commission of terrible crimes,” said the judge overseeing SBF’s case.

$BTC: Crypto Influencer Calls Michael Saylor’s “MicroStrategy Orange” Bitcoin Protocol “Idiotic” | Cryptoglobe


                                
On May 1, MicroStrategy announced the launch of a new decentralized identity platform, termed MicroStrategy Orange. This innovation was revealed by Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy during their “Bitcoin For Corporations” conference.



The newly introduced platform leverages the Bitcoin network’s Ordinal-based inscriptions to manage digital identities, which promises a new layer of functionality and security in the digital space. Unlike traditional systems, MicroStrategy Orange operates directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, bypassing the need for sidechains, and is capable of handling up to 10,000 decentralized identifiers (DIDs) in a single transaction.



MicroStrategy Orange stands out by being completely open-source and offering robust features tailored for the modern digital landscape. It aims to provide “trustless, tamper-proof, and enduring decentralized identities,” as stated in an early draft document of the solution available on GitHub.



The decentralized identity (DID) system allows users a level of pseudonymity akin to how real-world identities are distinct from Bitcoin addresses and transactions. This system will enable users to create and manage their digital identities independently, without relying on external validation or traditional identity verification processes.



An innovative application of this technology is “Orange For Outlook,” a tool developed by MicroStrategy to integrate digital signatures into emails, enhancing communication security and authenticity. The process begins when a user accepts an invitation email signed by MicroStrategy’s DID, leading to the generation of a unique DID and associated cryptographic keys for the individual.



Following this setup, the user’s DID and public key are recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling them to extend invitations to others to establish their digital identities.



Looking forward, MicroStrategy plans to expand the utility of MicroStrategy Orange to other platforms, including various messaging applications, social media networks, and sectors like e-commerce, enterprise, and fintech.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Not everyone was impressed, though, by MicroStrategy Orange. For example, here is what crypto influencer Udi Wertheimer had to say about it:







Udi Wertheimer is recognized in the cryptocurrency community for his insightful and often contrarian perspectives on Bitcoin and blockchain technologies. A developer and a Bitcoin aficionado, Wertheimer is known for his sharp critiques and analyses of crypto trends and projects, gaining a robust following on social media platforms where he shares his views.



With a background in software development and a deep interest in the principles of Bitcoin, Udi stands as a credible figure among both proponents and critics of cryptocurrency. He actively engages in discussions on the scalability, security, and future trajectories of cryptocurrencies, often challenging mainstream views on new blockchain initiatives.



Ordinals, a recent innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem, have been a particular focus of Udi’s commentary. This technology, made possible by the Taproot upgrade, allows arbitrary data to be inscribed onto individual satoshis—the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Ordinals have introduced the possibility of creating Bitcoin-native non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by associating unique data with specific satoshis, thereby expanding Bitcoin’s utility beyond mere digital cash.



This has stirred debates within the Bitcoin community about the implications of such uses on the blockchain’s transaction sizes and overall focus. Despite this, Udi has voiced strong support for the experimentation with Ordinals, defending developers and users against accusations of harming the Bitcoin network.



He argues that such innovations align with the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin and foster a unique on-chain culture, which he sees as vital against the backdrop of Bitcoin’s evolving narrative. On 2 March, Udi expressed an extremely bullish view on Ordinals, predicting a significant rise in interest and suggesting they could become prime targets for phishing attacks due to their potential value. He also noted the prospect of high returns on investment in well-established Ordinals, emphasizing the transformative impact they could have on the market.

US Prosecutors are Digging into the Financial Transactions at Block: Report


							

US prosecutors are looking into financial transactions at Block.



Block allegedly processed transactions involving countries under US sanctions.



The company also allegedly failed to gather sufficient information from its users.




Prosecutors in the United States are looking into the financial transactions at Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s Block, the parent firm of Cash App and Square. 



As per a NBC report, citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter, the prosecutors are looking into the internal practices at Block and discussing with a former employee the alleged widespread and compliance issues at Cash App and Square.









The former employee at Dorsey’s company provided documents to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, which show that Cash App and Square customers were not asked to share sufficient information to assess their risks. 



The documents also reveal that Square successfully processed thousands of transactions that involved nations subjected to economic sanctions by the United States. Further, the documents also show that the firm processed transactions for certain terrorist groups. 



The former employee said that “from the ground up, everything in the compliance section was flawed,” while adding:




“It is led by people who should not be in charge of a regulated compliance program.”




The document spanning over 100 pages shows many transactions, in even dollar amounts, being processed in countries under US sanctions like Cuba, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. Former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawyer, Edward Siedle, said: 




“It’s my understanding from the documents that compliance lapses were known to Block leadership and the board in recent years.”




The former employee also noted that most of the transactions, including credit cards, US dollars, or Bitcoin (BTC), were never reported to the authorities as required. When Block was alerted to breaches, the company failed to correct its operating methods, the employee added.

Hundred Finance hacker moves stolen assets a year after $7M exploit

The hacker who stole $7.4 million from the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Hundred Finance has started moving the crypto assets after a year of inactivity. On May 1, the hacker moved Ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT) worth about $800,000 from Curve’s decentralized exchange (DEX) after providing liquidity on the platform more than one year ago. Token transactions made by the Hundred Finance hacker. Source: EtherscanAfter withdrawing the funds, the hacker converted USDT and other cryptocurrencies into ETH. This increased the exploiter’s ETH by more than $1 million. The hacker currently holds a total of $4.3 million in assets in the wallet, which includes various crypto assets like Dai (DAI), Wrapped Ether, Frax and Wrapped Bitcoin. On April 15, 2023, the DeFi protocol reported that it had suffered a security breach on the layer-2 network Optimism. According to the blockchain security firm CertiK, the attacker manipulated the exchange rate between ERC-20 tokens and hTOKENS. This allowed them to withdraw more tokens than were deposited. This is commonly known in the DeFi world as a flash loan attack. This type of attack vector usually involves borrowing large amounts of funds with some form of uncollateralized loan from a lending platform. The attacker then uses the assets to manipulate the price of crypto on DeFi platforms. In the Hundred Finance hack, large loans were taken out under the falsified exchange rate. In 2022, Hundred Finance also suffered an exploit on the Gnosis Chain. The protocol’s liquidity was drained through a reentrancy attack, resulting in a $6 million loss. Related: Pike Finance clarifies ‘USDC vulnerability’ statement on $1.6M exploitWhile flash loan attacks have wreaked havoc within the space in the past few years, April 2024 showed a significant decrease in losses from this type of hack. According to a report from CertiK, flash loan attacks only accounted for $129,000 lost in April. Its largest single incident within the month only caused $55,000 in damages. CertiK said in the report that this was the lowest amount lost to flash loan attacks since February 2022.Meanwhile, losses to crypto hacks in general also decreased in April. Security company PeckShield reported that only $60 million was lost to hacks in the month. This represents a sharp decline from February and March, which recorded $360 million and $187 million in losses, respectively.Magazine: Woman accused of $6B scam, China loophole for Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs: Asia Express

PEPE flips ARB: A Fluke or start of a new trend? - AMBCrypto



PEPE manages to flip ARB in terms of market cap as price of the memecoin surged.
Social activity around PEPE fell, sentiment remained high.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] recent price plummet led to corrections across the board for various currencies. The memecoin sector was also impacted by the same causing massive price declines.
PEPE to the moon?
However, PEPE [PEPE] was one of the memecoins that managed to see green during this period. According to new data, the third largest memecoin managed to outperform ARB in terms of market cap.
Source: CoinMarketCap
However, it wasn’t an easy journey for PEPE in the last few months. Starting from the 14th of March after testing the $0.000001082 level,  the price started to fall.
PEPE continued to show multiple lower lows and lower highs after this, indicating a bearish trend. There were no signs of reversal for quite some time, until the 23rd of April, when it tested the $0.000000793 level and broke the cycle of lower highs and lower lows.
Even though price hasn’t been able to push past this level in the last few days, some bullish sentiment and momentum may help the memecoin see green in the near future.
However, indicators weren’t on the side of PEPE at the time of writing. The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) fell in the last few days.
A declining CMF indicated that the money flowing into the token fell significantly. Moreover, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) also decreased, implying that bullish momentum around the memecoin declined materially.
These factors indicate that PEPE might move sideways for sometime before retesting the $0.000000793 level in the future. At press time, the token was trading at $0.000006847 and its price rose by 6% in the last 24 hours.
Coupled with this, the volume at which PEPE was trading at had also surged by 38% during this period.

Due to this recent surge in price, $3.09 million worth of short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours.

Even though PEPE’s price surged and bears were making losses, a large part of its price movement would be dictated by social volume.

2 May: Four Solana Memecoins That Could Rally 9,000%, Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Epic Breakout Scenario Predicted by Crypto Analyst

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies.

In a recent tweet, crypto analyst Ali predicts an epic breakout scenario for the first and largest dog-themed cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Dogecoin (DOGE). Dogecoin experienced lackluster price activity in April, closing the month down 40%. May has also kicked off with a slow start for the dog coin, with its price down 3.39% so far. The current Dogecoin price activity has piqued the interest of traders and analysts, with many eagerly watching its movements to see what happens next. According to crypto analyst Ali, Dogecoin's price fall is typical of its behavior before major bull runs. Furthermore, Dogecoin's current 47% fall could be a healthy retracement, paving the way for a potential bull run amid a breakout from a descending triangle pattern. The descending triangle pattern, characterized by lower highs and horizontal support levels, usually signals a period of consolidation followed by a breakout. Given Dogecoin's history, the breakout from this pattern could be especially noteworthy. Ali cites examples to bring home his point. In 2017, DOGE broke out of a descending triangle. Afterward, the price retraced by 40% before entering a 982% bull run. Similarly, in 2021, Dogecoin broke out of a descending triangle and then retraced by 56% before rising by a massive 12,197%. Fast forward to 2024, and Dogecoin has once again broken out of a descending triangle and is currently experiencing a 47% price correction, much like past cycles. With DOGE breaking out of a descending triangle pattern and undergoing a significant correction, the stage might be set for a potential bull run, propelling the dog coin to new highs. However, as with any prediction on the cryptocurrency market, there are no guarantees, and past performance does not guarantee future outcomes. Whether Dogecoin will soar to new highs or not remains to be seen. At the time of writing, Dogecoin was up 2.93% in the last 24 hours to $0.128, mirroring the general market rebound after a slump at the start of May.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Rebound as Interest Rates Remain Unchanged in US - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin and Ethereum have rebounded after starting yesterday morning nearly 10% lower than they were on Tuesday.At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is around $57,700 after having made a 0.5% recovery in the past 24 hours. And the Ethereum price, after climbing 2.3% in the past day, is now trading for just below $3,000, according to CoinGecko data.But the damage has still been done. Per CoinGlass, the past 24 hours saw another $193 million worth of crypto futures contracts liquidated, adding to the $300 million worth of liquidations seen earlier this week.Economist and trader Alex Krüger explained that this current cycle feels so different for traders because it's largely been driven by interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which only just started trading in January this year."There has been barely any new retail coming into crypto," he wrote on Twitter. "It's been mostly ETF buyers and previous cycle participants redeploying and going out the risk curve."Analysts mostly attributed crashing crypto prices to fear in the market over certainty among investors that the Federal Open Markets Committee—which sets monetary policy and controls U.S. federal interest rates—would not lower rates. Then the Fed did exactly what the majority of investors thought it'd do by keeping interest rates unchanged, and crypto assets traded sideways.During a press conference yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that the fight to get inflation to 2% has been difficult, but added that he thought it was “unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.”“I’d say it’s unlikely,” he said, but warned that it was “likely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path to 2% inflation.”But even President Joe Biden has been optimistic that the Fed will still lower rates this year. "I do stand by my prediction that before the year is out, there'll be a rate cut," he said during a press conference in Japan last month. "This may delay it a month or so, I'm not sure of that."He was referring to the hotter-than-expected March inflation report that had just been released at the time.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Ethereum zkrollup: zkSync announces crypto partnership with Alchemy

Yesterday, zkSync, a well-known zkrollup developer on the Ethereum blockchain, announced a partnership with the crypto developer platform Alchemy.
This news brings new features to the crypto ecosystem, expanding the connections of the layer-2 with the rest of the web3 world.
Meanwhile, a former zkSync engineer has decided to launch his own project Sophone, a hyperchain focused on the entertainment sector, inaugurating the sale of a series of validator nodes.
Let’s see all the details below.

Ethereum’s zkRollup solution lands on the web3 development platform Alchemy: progress for the zkSync crypto ecosystem
Yesterday, Matter Labs, the company behind the developments of the Ethereum zkSync zkrollup layer-2, announced integration with the Alchemy development platform.
Now the high-throughput second-layer blockchain, which represents the first rollup compatible with EVM guaranteed by zero-knowledge proofs, can be more easily leveraged by the developer community, relying on a convenient and secure tool like Alchemy.

Specifically, on Alchemy developers can access advanced APIs, custom RPCs, Supernode, Alchemy Signer for embedded accounts, and much more, all within a single dashboard.
By doing so, industry professionals are encouraged to build new blockchain applications, being able to rely on a suite of tools to scale and distribute such products efficiently across the web.
One of the unlocked features closest to the non-developer world is definitely that of custom RPC, which allows you to use zkSync zkrollup through an endpoint different from the one offered by MetaMask, often overcrowded with requests.
By creating a private API key (and going to the command line), users can use Ethereum’s scalable secondary network by sending transactions through a secondary endpoint.
Alternatively, you can go through Chainlist for the same purpose.
Example of API key obtained after creating an app on Alchemy. Source: https://dashboard.alchemy.com/
Soon on Alchemy new features will be unlocked at home zkSync like now the Sepolia Faucet, a developer education program a “collab merch” dedicated to chain operators.
Just one step away from the launch of the ZKS crypto and the supposed airdrop that will be dedicated to chain users, zkSync opens the doors to a new era of development for its ecosystem.
Based on zkSync with Alchemy, developers will be able to rely on a reliable, scalable, and accurate web3 infrastructure, ensuring a seamless development experience.
Former zkSync developer creates his own hyperchain Sophon: public sale of nodes announced
Another crypto news from the zkSync ecosystem, concerns the departure of the developer “0xsebastiena” from the Ethereum zkrollup team, in order to launch his own personal project.
This is Sophon, an entertainment platform that presents itself as a modular rollup that leverages zkSync’s Hyperchain technology and the ZK stack as the operating framework.
Basically, it acts as a layer-2 rollup that operates in validium mode, meaning it does not store transaction data on the main Ethereum network (thus it is cost-effective to use), designed to be customized for any high-performance application.
Its main fields of application are gaming, NFT ticketing , artificial intelligence for consumer and other entertainment sectors 
0xsebastiena presented the project to its audience on April 15, announcing in parallel two partnerships with Beam Network and Aethir Cloud.
The project has recently raised $10 million in VC funding through a round led by Paper Ventures and Maven11.

Just 15 days after the introduction of Sophon, a high hand grenade was dropped, starting the public sale of infrastructure nodes.
Anyone can decide to purchase a node, or better a token ERC-721 that gives the right to run the node itself (or delegate it) on Sophon.
The choice of public sale was made because the founder of the project has a great interest in the crypto world and can afford this option in order to decentralize their network as much as possible.
During this phase, you will be able to purchase a node at the price set by the reference tier: when the allocation of nodes for that specific tier ends, we move on to the next slot with a higher price, of course: first come, first served.
The node operators will obviously receive the commissions from the Sopshon network as well as an incentive directly in the next governance token $SOPH (20% of the total supply) that will be issued in the first 36 months after the mainnet launch.
More than 18,500 ETH have already been collected in this public fundraiser.

Attention if you are new to this field and want to expose yourself to the purchase of nodes. 
Assess the situation carefully and make the necessary considerations in light of the expenses you will have to incur to keep the node operational and the economic incentives you will receive.
A particular user has pointed out how this sale of nodes represents only and exclusively a method that allows the project team to make money.

Peter Schiff Discloses Downside Target For Bitcoin, Downtrend Imminent? | Bitcoinist.com


								Peter Schiff, a popular critic of Bitcoin and staunch advocate for Gold, has delved into the ongoing debate surrounding BTC’s valuation, predicting a potential downside pressure in the near future and setting his target at the $54,000 price level.
Bitcoin Continues To Face Downside Pressure
Earlier today, Schiff identified a negative pattern on the Bitcoin chart, indicating that the price of the cryptocurrency is likely to decline. He claims that the most recent examination of Bitcoin’s short-term chart demonstrates a shift in the attitudes of the market.
Schiff’s observation was made amid a background of elevated volatility and erratic sentiment, as Bitcoin has been moving in a downward direction over the last several days. The recent disclosure by the economist about the short-term downside objective of Bitcoin has garnered significant interest from the cryptocurrency community.

According to him, the pivotal $60,000, which was observed to be a support level on this shorter-term BTC chart, has turned into a resistance level. As a result, Schiff suggests a negative change in trend due to a short-term head-and-shoulders pattern appearing on the Bitcoin chart. 
With the neckline just below $57,000, Schiff highlighted that the head lingers around $60,000, while the shoulder is situated around $58,500. Thus, he has placed his downside target for Bitcoin at the $54,000 level in the short term.
Potential decline to $54,000 | Source: Peter Schiff on X
Schiff also voiced concerns about the lack of discussion about the largest cryptocurrency asset from the American business news channel CNBC, following a decrease in Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the past few days.
Over the past two days, the BTC Spot ETFs have fallen by more than 10%, closing below their market high by about 23%, but yet neither the products nor BTC were talked about by the news channel in the timeframe. Meanwhile, should the Spot BTC ETFs have increased by 10%, the digital asset would have been covered all day.
Peter Schiff has consistently attacked BTC over time. Earlier this month, the economist declared that buyers of BTC Spot ETFs will soon begin to pull out as the market’s volatility overwhelms them.
Given that the coin’s long-term bear market is starting to gather up steam once more, Schiff claims all of the new investors in the funds will be riding along with the wave, prompting his confidence that these investors will bail out soon.
BTC In The Bear Market, Party Is Over
As the market continues to fluctuate, the gold advocate addressed the current state of BTC, noting that the digital asset is in a bear market, despite all the excitement surrounding the spot ETFs.

“Turn out the lights HODLers, the party is over,” he said, claiming that one BTC is currently worth less than 25 ounces, up by 33% in comparison to gold, and down by 23% in the US dollars.

This is what a Trump capital gains tax could look like


President Biden recently made a stir with his latest budget proposal, which included several provisions that alarmed investors. The first and arguably most important for anyone involved with the stock market is the proposed new and increased capital gains tax.
Under the plan, the rate would reach its highest since the tax was established in 1913 at a maximum of 44.6%.
The proposal immediately proved controversial, given how it compares to the original maximum of 7% and the 1921 Revenue Act maximum of 12.5%. It is also substantially higher than the rate set during former President Trump’s term when it was reformed not to exceed 20%.


With this in mind, and particularly considering that Trump will in all likelihood be Biden’s opponent in the upcoming elections, Finbold decided to take a look at what the capital gains tax for stocks and cryptocurrencies might look like should the administration change. 
Likely President Trump’s capital gains tax
At the time of publication, there appears to be little room for speculation on what a Trump second-term capital gains policy could look like, given that the proposal has already been published.
Unsurprisingly, given the standard Republican approach, the Trump campaign plans to lower the maximum capital gains tax rate to 15%. This would follow his previous term, which saw the rate set at a maximum of 20%.
Still, it is noteworthy that such a decrease might face resistance. 
The fairly unintuitive fact – at least given the standard rhetoric – that U.S. public debt tended to increase more under Republican administrations could, when paired with the frightening pace at which the burden is already increasing, could make such a decrease impractical to implement.
On the other hand, the rising debt might not prove a hurdle for all parts of the tax plan depending on how willing a potential Trump administration would be to further cut social, infrastructure, and other public spending and refrain from boosting the defense budget – or, failing that, to ramp up the pace of debt-taking.
Still, while it isn’t certain just how the capital, dividend, and other taxes might look like under a second Trump presidency, it is likely the other controversial aspect of Biden’s proposal – the unrealized gains tax – would not see the light of day, especially since the campaign leveled hefty criticism against the current administration over the budget.

Is XRP Going to Lead Crypto Market Reversal? Unexpected Reversal Says Yes

Recent trading activities suggest that XRP might be gearing up for a reversal on the market. The asset recently exhibited a significant bounce, pushing its price close to the $0.57 mark. This rebound was backed by a substantial increase in trading volume, hinting at growing interest from buyers and potentially setting the stage for a bullish market rally.Currently, XRP's price movement shows it outpacing other digital assets, indicating its strong position on the market. This progression is critical as it reflects a strength the asset possesses while the rest of the market clearly struggles. However, for XRP to maintain its upward trajectory and confirm a bullish trend, it must first overcome the resistance level at $0.52.XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the chart further, XRP's price action finds robust support at around $0.50, a level from which it has managed to rebound. It suggests that buyers are stepping in at lower price points, despite the fact that it was not expected at all.On the upside, the resistance levels to watch are $0.52, followed by $0.57. If XRP can breach the $0.52 level, it could attempt to challenge the higher resistance, and a break above this could pave the way toward testing the $0.60 threshold.For the future, maintaining above the $0.52 mark is crucial. A consistent hold above this resistance could confirm a shift to bullish conditions, likely attracting more buying pressure. However, if XRP fails to sustain this breakout, it might move between the known support and resistance levels until a clearer trend emerges.

Crypto expert Plan B sets Bitcoin price for 2025


Bitcoin (BTC) began May with a significant sell-off after losing crucial support at $60,000 and falling as low as $56,000 leaving many market participants anticipating further declines.
This plunge comes as the crypto market remains on the edge, with uncertainty lingering about the potential onset of the historical post-halving rally.
In light of these developments, crypto analyst Plan B shared insights into Bitcoin’s price outlook for the remainder of the month in a YouTube video posted on May 1.


Firstly, the expert delved into the Bitcoin stock-to-flow model, highlighting that Bitcoin closed slightly above $60,000 the previous month. While this marked a $10,000 drop from March, Bitcoin still maintained a 36% year-to-date increase.
Plan B emphasized the historical accuracy of the stock-to-flow model in predicting Bitcoin’s price. He pointed out that May 2024 marks the final month before the next halving event. Historically, each halving has coincided with a gray stock-to-flow model price, underscoring the predictive power of this model.

Bitcoin price targets
Regarding specific price points, the expert pointed out that while the current average Bitcoin price hovers around $34,000, it closely aligns with the ballpark figure of $55,000 predicted by the original 2019 model.

“The average price is something that we can calculate at the moment. It’s $34,000, and that’s a little below the $55,000 that the 2019 original stock-to-flow model predicted, but it’s in the ballpark. It’s the same order of magnitude, and don’t forget in 2019, the Bitcoin price was below $4,000. The average Bitcoin price was above the stock-to-flow model price in the cycle before the last cycle, the 2016-2020 cycle,” he said. 

Despite some fluctuations, Plan B updated the model’s parameters, maintaining an average target price of around $500,000 between 2024 and 2028. He highlighted the importance of the halving event in driving up the model value, anticipating a gradual increase in Bitcoin’s price over the coming months.
Looking ahead to the second half of 2024, the expert expressed confidence in Bitcoin reaching $100,000, driven by the need for mining revenue to recover following the halving event. He based this prediction on historical trends, noting that mining revenue typically recovers within four to eight months post-halving.
The trading expert also expects the market peak to occur in 2025, with Bitcoin’s price potentially surpassing $200,000.
Technical indicators’ prediction
Plan B also analyzed technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the 200-week moving average (MA). He noted that the RSI has normalized to around 66 after reaching a high of 77. This normalization suggests that Bitcoin’s price is stabilizing within the context of previous market cycles.
He mentioned that the 200-week moving average has increased slightly to $34,000. The analyst described this value as a conservative floor for Bitcoin’s price during bull markets, indicating that Bitcoin prices typically rise well above this level during such periods.
Notably, Bitcoin’s current losses came after the halving event, while interest in exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows was exhausted. This has left Bitcoin investors focusing on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy amid stubborn inflationary figures. At the moment, the Fed has left interest rates unchanged.

As things stand, Bitcoin must now maintain its price above the $55,000 mark, as a drop below this level could validate sustained bearish sentiment.

Trading: Record outflows for Bitcoin Spot ETFs

On Wednesday, trading on US ETFs on spot Bitcoin recorded an exceptional day, marking the largest daily net outflows since their creation. 
The aggregate outflow reached the astonishing figure of 563.7 million dollars, a significant change in investor sentiment. 
According to SosoValue data, this event has marked a significant moment in the financial markets, especially in the cryptocurrency sector.

Trading analysis: The outflow of ETFs on Bitcoin spot in detail
The most significant outflow occurred in the Fidelity FBTC, which saw a withdrawal of $191 million from the fund.
This figure not only represents the largest withdrawal of the day, but also exceeds the previous record net outflow of 167.3 million dollars recorded by the GBTC of Grayscale.
The movement in these funds reflects changes in investor strategies and reactions to market conditions, which can be rapid and substantial in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies.
Even Grayscale’s GBTC was not far behind, with net outflows of $167.3 million. This amount is noteworthy as it indicates a continuing trend where large sums are being moved away from what has been one of the most popular Bitcoin investment vehicles.
The ARKB of Ark Invest also saw a significant reduction, with $98.1 million leaving the fund, marking it as the third largest outflow of the day.
An interesting development has been noticed in the IBIT of BlackRock, which recorded its first daily net outflow since the beginning, totaling 36.9 million dollars. Similarly, the BITB of Bitwise reported outflows totaling 29 million dollars.
These figures underline a broader pattern of declining interest or strategic reallocations by investors within the bitcoin spot ETF market.
In contrast to these outflows, the Hashdex DEFI ETF has stood out by maintaining a neutral position with zero net inflows and outflows, highlighting its stability or different investor perceptions on that particular day.
The meaning of trend changes
These changes are significant not only for their size, but for what they mean regarding the general market sentiment towards bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments through ETFs.
The total cumulative net flow for the 11 spot bitcoin ETFs tracked stood at $11.2 billion at Wednesday’s close, indicating strong initial interest since their respective launch. 
Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, an investment consulting company, commented on the situation through a post on X (previously Twitter), stating: “So, the iShares Bitcoin ETF had its first day of outflows ($37 million). That’s how ETFs work. Inflows don’t increase in a straight line.”
This drop in investment inflows comes after a significant enthusiasm around spot bitcoin ETFs that seems to have started to decrease. 
April marked a change with total monthly net outflows of 343.5 million dollars, interrupting a series of three months of inflows. Among these, the GBTC was particularly affected with 2.5 billion dollars leaving the ETF during the month, driving the outflows.
The declining interest could be attributed to several factors, including regulatory concerns, market volatility, and perhaps a reevaluation of the role of bitcoin in diversified investment portfolios. 
The dynamics of investments in cryptocurrencies are influenced by various global economic factors, technological advancements, and changes in regulatory landscapes, all capable of leading to rapid changes in investor behavior.
Furthermore, significant outflows may also reflect a broader trend towards risk aversion among investors, possibly due to wider economic uncertainties or specific developments within the cryptocurrency market. 
Since ETFs offer a relatively simple way to invest in bitcoin without having to deal with the complexities of direct ownership of cryptocurrencies (such as wallets and keys), movements within these funds can serve as a barometer for the overall investor sentiment towards bitcoin.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the outflows records from ETFs on spot bitcoin in the United States highlight a potentially critical moment for cryptocurrency investments. 
As the landscape continues to evolve, both experienced investors and novices will closely observe these developments to assess the future trajectory of bitcoin and its place in investment strategies. 
Whether this change is a temporary realignment or a sign of a deeper shift in investor confidence remains to be seen. The next few months will be crucial in shaping the narrative and investment models in the cryptocurrency market.

The Cigna Group (NYSE: CI) has reported its first quarter 2024 results, showcasing a robust performance and raising its outlook for the full year. The global health company announced total revenues of $57.3 billion for the first quarter, marking a significant increase from the previous year. Despite a shareholders’ net loss of $0.3 billion, or $0.97 per share, the adjusted income from operations stood at $1.9 billion, or $6.47 per share. 



The quarter also saw the company making headway with its sale of Medicare businesses to HCSC, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. This move and the reported financials reflect Cigna’s ongoing efforts to optimize its business mix and enhance operational efficiency. The company’s SG&A expense ratio improved to 6.4% from 7.6% in the first quarter of 2023, indicating its successful cost management strategies. Additionally, the debt-to-capitalization ratio saw a slight increase, primarily due to the timing of debt issuance related to the Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreements.

Comparing Cigna’s first-quarter performance to market expectations reveals a company that not only met but exceeded forecasts. Analysts projected earnings per share (EPS) of $6.22 and revenue of $56.6 billion for the quarter. Cigna’s reported EPS of $6.47 and revenue of $57.3 billion comfortably surpass these expectations, signaling stronger-than-anticipated contributions from its diversified portfolio of businesses. The company’s ability to outperform amidst a challenging healthcare landscape highlights its operational resilience and strategic foresight.



Cigna Raises Full Year Earnings Outlook to At Least $28.40 Per Share



Cigna’s guidance for the remainder of 2024 paints an optimistic picture, with the company raising its full-year earnings outlook to at least $28.40 per share. This revised outlook reflects confidence in sustained growth and operational efficiency across its segments.

These Are All the New Features Coming to Aave V4


Aave Protocol is preparing for a significant upgrade with its upcoming V4 release, scheduled for mid-2025. 
This new version builds on the foundation laid by V3, aiming to transform the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector with new features and improved user experience.
How Aave V4 Enhances Lending Protocol
Aave V4 introduces a new architectural blueprint to minimize governance overhead and enhance modularity. This change promises to optimize capital efficiency and integrate the Aave-native stablecoin, GHO, more seamlessly than ever before. 
Moreover, V4 will incorporate risk management tools and a more efficient liquidation engine to bolster security and user confidence.

“Given the competitive DeFi landscape, we believe the key to staying ahead is continued innovation, building, and shipping excellent solutions that address the ongoing requirements of the Aave community. The suggested ideas aim to position Aave at the forefront of DeFi in 2030 and beyond,” Aave Labs wrote.

The highlight of V4 is the introduction of a Unified Liquidity Layer. This feature evolves from the Portals concept in V3, offering a more abstract and independent framework for liquidity management. It will allow Aave to adjust supply and draw caps, interest rates, and incentives without the cumbersome need to migrate liquidity for new borrow modules.
Another significant advancement is the implementation of fuzzy-controlled interest rates. This approach automates interest adjustments based on real-time market conditions. The integration with Chainlink ensures the most accurate and efficient on-chain interest rate models.

Aave V4 also plans to introduce Liquidity Premiums. This feature will enable differentiated borrowing costs based on the risk profile of the collateral, fine-tuning the economic incentives for using riskier assets.
For user convenience, V4 will debut Smart Accounts. These accounts address the operational complexity of managing multiple wallets by allowing users to handle various borrowing positions from a single wallet interface.

Regarding risk management, V4 will adopt a dynamic risk configuration system. This system allows for asset-specific configurations that can evolve without impacting existing borrowers, significantly reducing governance friction.
Read more: How To Use Aave?
The development timeline for Aave V4 spans from initial research in Q2 2024 to a complete rollout by mid-2025. This phased approach includes extensive community engagement, rigorous testing, and multiple audits to meet security and reliability standards.

News from MicroStrategy: Orange, a platform based on Bitcoin, is coming soon

Yesterday, the founder and President of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, announced the news of a new platform based on Bitcoin, called Orange.

MicroStrategy has been dedicating itself not only to investments in BTC for some time now, but also to the development of software based on the Bitcoin protocol. 

Bitcoin news: the MicroStrategy Orange protocol
MicroStrategy Orange is a new protocol developed by MicroStrategy and based on the Bitcoin protocol.
Indeed, Bitcoin before being a financial asset (BTC) is a decentralized and open source P2P computer protocol, which can therefore be used by anyone as a basis for developing protocols based on it. 
Furthermore, the name itself, Orange, is a clear reference to the color orange, which is commonly associated with Bitcoin.
MicroStrategy Orange is a decentralized identity (ID) platform built on the Bitcoin network. Its presentation yesterday took place during the MicroStrategy World event: Bitcoin for Corporations 2024, so it is mainly aimed at large companies. 
The company’s executive vice president, Cezary Raczko, presented Orange as a business platform developed by MicroStrategy for creating applications based on decentralized identities on the Bitcoin blockchain.
This is an IT platform composed of three fundamental parts, at the center of which there is a cloud-hosted service that allows issuing identifiers to its users and organization.
Thanks to this innovation, pre-packaged applications that work on the same MicroStrategy Orange platform and address specific challenges related to digital identity can be distributed.
The idea seems to be to be able to incorporate the ability to create a digital identity within Bitcoin wallets, to identify people in a certain and unique way. It could be used, for example, to ensure that the sender of a text message or an email is actually who they claim to be. 
MicroStrategy wants to become the world’s first Bitcoin development company. 
Why Bitcoin?
The reason why the Bitcoin protocol was chosen as the basis on which to develop this platform is the robust security features and immutability of its blockchain. 
MicroStrategy started investing in BTC in 2020, and now it owns more than 214,000 BTC.
Facing a total investment of over 7.5 billion dollars, now there is a capital in Bitcoin worth over 12 billion dollars, with an unrealized gain of over 60%. 
Since the company, which is listed on the stock exchange with the ticker MSTR, has a market capitalization of just under 17.5 billion dollars, the bulk of its value comes from the BTC it owns. 
It is therefore not a coincidence that in recent years she has also started working on the Bitcoin protocol. 
After all, even though it was founded in 1989, twenty years before the launch of the Bitcoin blockchain, it is an innovative company that operates in the field of business intelligence, but also in mobile software and cloud-based services. 
So if on one hand it has chosen to invest in BTC at a financial level, now it is also working to invest in Bitcoin at an economic and productive level, with the development of new software based on the decentralized Bitcoin protocol. 
However, it is worth noting that yesterday the price of its shares on the stock market did not move significantly after Orange’s announcement. 
The usefulness of Orange
Yesterday Raczko stated that integrating digital identity based on Bitcoin with a broader ecosystem of verifiable credentials opens up a large number of very interesting use cases.
He mentioned, for example, the verification of academic qualifications, or the certification of participation in courses, and even medical records. 
The fact is that the Bitcoin blockchain is anonymous, or at least pseudo-anonymous, even though it is public, but the Bitcoin protocol is based on public digital signatures verifiable by anyone. 
The difference for this type of use is precisely the fact that the correctness of the signatures can be publicly verified with absolute certainty on the Bitcoin blockchain, despite it being anonymous. 
So associating a digital identity to those signatures makes it possible to use a public and verifiable system with certainty by everyone to associate a specific identity to a specific transaction, or to a document, so that anyone can personally verify without any doubt. 
Furthermore, the identity will not be published on the blockchain, which will remain anonymous, but thanks to platforms like Orange it can be verified by those who use it. 
Many companies could benefit from a system that allows to have absolute certainty not only of digital signatures, but also of the identity to which they are associated, without having to rely on third-party custodians who could always, at least in theory, be unreliable.

30% Drop in Crypto Trading Volume and NFT Sales in April


In April, the crypto and the non-fungible token (NFT) market witnessed significant declines, signaling a cooling period for digital asset transactions. 
As trading activities dwindled, key players and Crypto platforms faced marked declines in transaction metrics. This shift indicates a recalibration of crypto market dynamics, reflecting investor caution and a reevaluation of asset values.
Crypto Trading Volume and NFT Sales Drop
Data from centralized exchanges (CEXs) revealed a substantial decrease in spot trading volumes. These have plummeted by 35.7% from March’s $2.49 trillion to just $1.6 trillion. 
Binance, the largest player in the field, accounted for 43.7% of this volume, translating to approximately $699.25 billion.

Parallel to this, the NFT sector also experienced a downturn. NFT sales dipped to $1.15 billion in April, marking a 31.26% decline from the previous month. 
The drop was not limited to sales alone. Indeed, the number of active NFT buyers and sellers also decreased substantially. Buyer participation fell by over half, down 51.88%, and seller activity reduced by 45.72%, indicating a shrinking market interest.
The downturn affected several blockchains where NFTs are commonly traded. Ethereum and Solana, for instance, saw their NFT sales decrease dramatically.
Ethereum’s NFT transactions halved, sinking by 56.8%, while Solana recorded a 39.4% fall in sales. This trend was consistent across various blockchains. However, only a few exceptions, like Immutable X and Avalanche, surprisingly registered increases in NFT transactions.


“The downturn in NFT sales and participation across blockchain platforms could stifle innovation in the space, as the market shifts from speculative to pragmatic value. Creators and platforms need to prioritize real-world use cases, such as certificates of ownership, digital identities, and gaming assets with meaningful in-game utility, ensuring transfer fees are a fraction of the asset price,” Karim Chaib, CEO of Dopamine, told BeInCrypto.

Specific Bitcoin-based NFT collections bucked the downward spiral despite the overall negative trend. In April, The Bitcoin Puppets and the Bitcoin-based WZRDs collection saw their values skyrocket by 2,064.97% and 25,796%, respectively. 

“Bitcoin-based NFTs appear to be more resilient than Ethereum and Solana-based NFTs due to their relative novelty on the Bitcoin network, attracting curiosity and interest from the crypto community. The scarcity of historical data and the novelty of Bitcoin Ordinals make them appealing, coinciding with narratives around the Bitcoin halving, which often stirs bullish sentiment,” Chaib concluded.


This suggests that while the broader market is in decline, niche collections can still capture significant interest and command high valuations.

What Might Happen in Bitcoin in the Future? Analysts Shared Their Predictions for the Summer Months! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to industry analysts, Bitcoin futures investors are preparing for a slowdown in market activity during the summer months.
Analysts Say Bitcoin Options Expect to Slow Over Summer

“Summers are typically periods of low volatility and investors start taking positions based on their biases,” said Bitfinex Futures Manager Jag Kooner.

Kooner stated that Bitcoin's volatility has decreased significantly since mid-April.


Data from the Data Dashboard also supports this, showing that the volatility of Bitcoin options for one-week, one-month and multi-month maturities dropped from 77% to below 60%.
Ethereum options volatility has also decreased to a similar extent as Bitcoin since mid-April.






Bartosz Lipiński, CEO of Cube.Exchange, interprets Ethereum's decline as a sign that investors are waiting for price fluctuations to calm down while waiting for Ethereum's regulatory status in the US to become clear.


“Typically, when there is uncertainty, investors become risk-averse, move into cash and sit on the sidelines, and I wouldn't be surprised if a similar situation is true for Ethereum,” Lipiński said in a statement.
Lipiński added that due to uncertainty about Ethereum's status in the US, whether it is considered a security or not, many investors will either stay on the sidelines or seek opportunities elsewhere until the situation becomes clearer.


However, Lipiński warned that in the summer months, when transaction volumes are low, volatility may increase due to liquidity gaps in the market.
“The summer months can be a relatively quiet period, as stock markets often are, but one only has to look back to 2017, the DeFi summer, and the last major bull run to see the effects of low liquidity on relatively bullish crypto markets,” he added.

First Mover Americas: BTC Stabilizes Around $58K Following Yesterday's Rout

Bitcoin stabilized around the $58,000 mark after the U.S. Federal Reserve kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday. Chair Powell said the economy is too strong to cut rates while ruling out increases despite disappointing inflation figures. Having lost the $60,000 support level late on Tuesday, BTC fell as low as $56,500 yesterday, with U.S. spot ETFs seeing outflows of $563.7 million, the highest daily figure since the funds listed in January. At the time of writing bitcoin was priced at $58,282, up 1.4% over 24 hours. The digital asset market at large is up around 4%, according to CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), as altcoins such as SOL and AVAX led a recovery from Wednesday's rout.

BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has its first day of outflows


As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade in the red, United States spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to the crypto have posted record net outflows.
Significantly, BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust recorded its first-ever single-day outflow on May 1, as Bitcoin lost support around the $60,000 mark, dropping to as low as $56,000.
US Bitcoin ETFs saw a total of $563.7 million exiting the market, according to data from Farside shared on May 2. Notably, BlackRock, the largest investment firm globally, saw its streak of positive inflows cut short and recorded its first day of outflows totaling $36.9 million.

Elsewhere, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust saw the largest outflow at $167.4 million, while Fidelity and Ark ETFs experienced withdrawals of $191.1 million and $98.1 million, respectively.
Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETF
Despite the BlackRock ETF recording losses, the interest of institutional investors in the product remains strong. A notable example is BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe, which recently invested in the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF.
At the same time, as reported by Finbold, BNY Mellon, the largest custodian bank globally, also invested in ETFs from BlackRock and Grayscale.
While ETF outflows are contributing to Bitcoin prices’ decline, some market participants maintain a positive outlook. For instance, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reassured that Bitcoin ETFs are still functioning well.

“Should add — these ETFs are operating smoothly across the board. Inflows and outflows are part of the norm in the life of an ETF,” he said. 

Bitcoin price remains under pressure
As the ETFs continue to record outflows, the market remains uncertain, with attention focused on the Federal Reserve monetary policy. Indeed, as things stand, the momentum from ETFs that saw Bitcoin rally to a new record above $73,000 has faded while investors await the gains from the halving event to play out.
In the meantime, there is speculation that Bitcoin could drop to almost the $50,000 mark. By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $58,191, having gained almost 1% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, BTC is down about 9%.

Second Wind for Memecoins? Platform Reports Increased Activity


							

Platform simplifies memecoin creation, sparking renewed interest.



Memecoin popularity dipped in April but appears to be recovering.



Increased deployments and rising index signal potential memecoin resurgence.




After a period of waning popularity in April, the memecoin sector appears to be experiencing a resurgence. This potential revival is fueled by a recent surge in activity on Pump.fun, a platform that streamlines the creation and deployment of memecoins.



Pump.fun removes the technical barriers often associated with launching a cryptocurrency. Users can design their memecoin with a name, ticker symbol, and image for a minimal fee, all without needing advanced technical knowledge or pre-existing liquidity. 



The platform even incorporates safeguards against rug pulls, a notorious issue in the memecoin space. Every token launched on Pump.fun automatically implements a bonding curve for trading, where users directly influence the price through buying and selling. 



Once a token reaches a specific market cap, a portion of the liquidity is deposited into a decentralized exchange and permanently locked, preventing developers from manipulating the token’s value.



Source: TheBlock



This user-friendly approach has been a recipe for success for Pump.fun. The platform surpassed a staggering $5 million in revenue within just two months of launch. Their daily earnings peaked in early April, coinciding with the apex of memecoin popularity. While revenue softened later in the month as memecoin interest cooled, Pump.fun maintained a steady daily income exceeding $120,000.









However, recent developments hint at a potential second wind for memecoins. The renewed activity on Pump.fun suggests a rise in memecoin deployments, indicating continued interest in the sector. 



Source: TradingView



Additionally, the GMCI MEME index which is a benchmark that tracks the performance of memecoins, displayed a positive shift. After dipping in mid-April, the index climbed back above 300 last week, signaling a potential rebound in memecoin valuations.

These Two Meme Coins Will Hit A '$10B Valuation By Summer,' Crypto Trader Predicts - Benzinga

Vapor, a widely followed crypto trader, expressed bullish views on established meme coins, forecasting a shift in market sentiment away from venture capitalist-backed tokens.What Happened: Vapor criticized the token distribution methods of recent projects like EigenLayer, suggesting that such ventures are exploiting end users. He also pointed out a growing weariness in the market towards such schemes, which he believes have become more efficient at benefiting founders and investors since 2021, at the expense of the end user.He further expressed his intention to increase his holdings in Dogwifhat WIF/USD and Pepe PEPE/USD, two well-known meme coins. He states, "I believe both WIF and PEPE will be north of $10 billion by summer and be the top performers among large caps."Also Read: Pepe Up 42% On The Week: ‘Don’t Buy Dogs, Cats…Buy Real Memes’ Says Crypto TraderWhy It Matters: Vapor’s tweet reflects a broader sentiment within the crypto community, where many are growing frustrated with the perceived exploitation by venture capitalists and project founders.

Bitcoin (BTC) Volatility Is Falling and This Will Continue as It Matures: Fidelity

As is the case with all emerging asset classes with a small market cap, the cryptocurrency is more likely to experience higher volatility due to new capital flows, the note said. “However, as the asset class matures and its total market cap grows, the inflow of capital is expected to have a smaller impact because it will be flowing into a larger capital base.”

Staking, Demand, Locked Tokens, Slow Mining: Ethereum Turns Deflationary | Cryptopolitan

Ethereum (ETH) may face a shortage of physical coins as its network has turned deflationary. Even at a supply of 120M, Ethereum demand is higher than supply. More coins are needed for staking and various security deposits, leaving less ETH to trade or move freely. Ethereum Usage Increases Token BurningEthereum is essentially the backbone of the current DeFi sector. Despite scalability issues, coins on the original blockchain are still needed and are even more valuable. One of the main drivers of ETH scarcity are the daily token burns, which accelerate with more transactions. During the peak NFT and DeFi market, Ethereum introduced the Ethereum burn program in late 2021. After the EIP-1559 upgrade, Ethereum introduced a new fee and block production schedule, where miners receive a base rate and all excess fees are burned. End users still may need to pay a relatively high fee for moving their ETH, but block producers will not be able to receive the excess funds. The fee burn program took off like wildfire, and so far the Ethereum network has burned coins worth about $12B based on market estimation. Liquid Staking Platforms Control Large Part of ETH SupplyETH owners have always desired to make use of their tokens, and liquid staking is a tool that aids in achieving that. Holders can now pledge their 32 ETH to secure the network while using the same liquidity in other ecosystems. The Lido liquid staking platform now draws in more than 28% of the ETH supply. More than 44M ETH are locked for securing the network. Lido and EigenLayer enable users to create value in new layers by utilizing tokens as collateral. A smart contract transparently locks the actual tokens, prohibiting their movement or sale on the market. Ethereum reports more than 122M in circulating supply, though there is some conflicting information. According to the burn tracker, the supply has diminished to 115M. For now, the network is experiencing slow deflation, solving the problem with the still un-capped supply. Ethereum Abandons Idea to Freeze ProductionThe older roadmap for Ethereum was to stall production at around 87M ETH. Initially, miners would be discouraged by making it too difficult to produce new tokens, leading to a mining ice age. But miners declined, stating fees were not enough to motivate them. With a mix of mining and staking, the Ethereum Foundation plans to continue producing blocks indefinitely. Token burns are achieving the supply drop, though not reaching the intended target of having less than 100M tokens. But staking and collaterals also turn ETH into a store of value. Over time, people may hold ETH for its value and only rarely use it for direct on-chain actions. Currently, multiple L2 networks offer scaled transactions that do not require Ethereum gas, but are still secured through the Ethereum network. The deflationary trend may also reverse, if fee burning and usage slows down. But during the bull market, increased Ethereum usage contributed to accelerating deflation and may have boosted the ETH market price. As of May 2024, Ethereum remains deflationary with 1.2M transactions per day and their related fee burns. Ethereum Still Not Easily ReplacedEthereum remains a highly secure network, even after phasing out the mining component. The high requirement of staking means it is too expensive to mount an attack. Despite the high fees and the creation of multiple L1 networks, Ethereum is still the go-to network for many projects and NFT collections. Migrations are also difficult and time-consuming. For now, projects discover workarounds such as L2 solutions, wrapped assets, synthetic tokens and off-chain computation. But some tokens are looking for multi-chain solutions and may transfer their activities to new blockchains.Ethereum is still highly usable for decentralized trading, as most of the prominent DEX have an Ethereum version.Will ETH Reach Extreme ValuationsThe recovery of ETH close to $4,000 during the current bull cycle was partly due to the fee burns and locked tokens. But long-term ETH price predictions still exist, as investors await the bull market to return in 2024 or 2025. For Ethereum, the price target of $10,000 has been talked about for years. So far, ETH has traded at four-digit prices, but only went close to $5,000 briefly. After the latest price correction, ETH dipped to $2,910.61, after briefly recovering above $3,300.

New research suggests Bitcoin mining centralized around Bitmain


For years, rumors have circulated that Bitcoin’s largest mining machine manufacturer has secretly centralized a majority of Bitcoin’s hash power. The theory is down to more than a simple observation of the logo stamped on most mining cases.
No, skeptics think that Bitmain’s pool itself — not just its machines — secretly creates the vast majority of blocks that are added to Bitcoin’s ledger.
A sleuth found a clue in Antpool’s block template: A manually prioritized transaction immediately after the 6.25 BTC block reward or ‘coinbase’ transaction. This new research by pseudonymous Bitcoin developer 0xb10c seemingly confirms long-rumored practices by Antpool hiding its massive operation under the names of ostensibly independent pools.
In short, it warns that despite tens of thousands of decentralized nodes, Bitcoin might actually be quite centralized from a mining perspective.
One template and custodian for supposedly independent pools
Specifically, 0xb10c detected that BTC.com Pool, Binance Pool, Poolin, EMCD, and Rawpool show signs of using Antpool’s method for prioritizing the post-coinbase transaction.
Antpool might also use a sixth pool, Braiins, but 0xb10c was still analyzing its merkle branches as of the research publication time. Nearly identical merkle branches might indicate that these five or six pools often use the exact same template as Antpool for selecting transactions to include in a block.
In other words, all of these pools often use Bitmain’s machines, often assemble transactions according to Bitmain’s block template, often prioritize the same manually-configured post-coinbase transaction as Bitmain, and often send coinbase and transaction fees to the same custodian as Bitmain.
It certainly makes Bitcoin look a little centralized.

Has Bitmain secretly centralized Bitcoin’s proof-of-work?
Founded in 2013, Bitmain is one of the oldest continuously operated Bitcoin companies. It’s also gigantic and six years ago sought to IPO for over a billion dollars.
Every miner knows that Bitmain machines generate nearly all hash power on the Bitcoin network. What’s not common knowledge is the size of Bitmain’s coinbase- and fee-sharing pool, AntPool.
According to its publicly-reported hash rate, Antpool by Bitmain claims to generate just one-quarter of Bitcoin’s hash rate. However, 0xb10c suspects it might secretly control a majority.
Because Bitcoin’s mining rewards arrive randomly to the single miner who guesses the Bitcoin difficulty threshold’s lottery-like winning number every 10 minutes, miners pool together to share work and average out these random 3.125 BTC payouts.
Prior to the halving, coinbase rewards were 6.25 BTC. On April 20, 2024, that number halved to 3.125.
Today, just three mining pools control the majority of Bitcoin’s hash rate. However, new research is suggesting that Bitmain’s Antpool has been disguising its work and submitting its winning blocks under the name of third-party pools.
That Bitmain has a near-monopoly on Bitcoin’s physical machinery is common knowledge. By far the most prevalent mining rigs performing proof-of-work hashing around the globe are Bitmain machines. 
Despite its famously poor customer service and product quality variability, its proprietary ASIC technologies have made its rigs unstoppably ubiquitous.
Antpool claims to generate just a quarter of Bitcoin’s hash rate.

Corroborating research on Bitmain’s Antpool dominance
Mononaut found more evidence that seems to support 0xb10c’s theory that Antpool might secretly use third-party pools to cloak Bitmain’s dominance. 
Mononaut traced coinbase rewards from mining pools AntPool, F2Pool, Binance Pool, Braiins, BTCcom, SECPOOL, Poolin, ULTIMUSPOOL and 1THash, and Luxor. He found suspicious levels of cooperation from these supposedly competitive entities in allocating coinbase rewards to a shared — possibly Antpool-controlled — custodian.
0xb10c couldn’t confirm that SECPOOL and SigmaPool entirely cloned AntPool’s template, although they seemed to share a similar template. In all, it seems unlikely that up to nine major bitcoin mining pools use a shared custodian for coinbase rewards unless a single entity is behind all of their operations.
Antpool had little to say about the suspicious activities or research reports by 0xb10c and Mononaut. Its most recent English-language tweet only referenced ‘making every hash count.’
Marty Bent, Matt Odell, and Matt Corallo discussed the allegations during a lengthy podcast. Corallo agreed with 0xb10c and Mononaut: “There’s one pool that has near 50% of hash power.”
In summary, if Antpool doesn’t control more than half of Bitcoin’s hashrate through collusion with or control over other mining pools, it seems to be getting pretty close. Bitcoin developer 0xb10c as well as Mononaut found evidence suggesting that Antpool and its alleged associates might control a majority of Bitcoin’s average hashrate.

Second-Largest European Bank BNP Paribas Bought BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Shares: SEC Filing - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsMultinational bank BNP Paribas purchased shares in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a form 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).According to the firm's 13F report filed May 1, BNP Paribas purchased 1,030 IBIT shares in the first quarter of 2024 at $40.47 a share, for a total of $41,684.10—less than the value of a single Bitcoin, at current prices.The second-largest bank in Europe by assets, BNP Paribas has allocated a comparitively miniscule portion of its investment portfolio to IBIT. Nevertheless, it marks one of the first verified occasions on which a major financial institution has purchased shares of a spot Bitcoin ETF—at least partially validating the thesis that institutional investors would be drawn to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.Institutional investment managers with at least $100 million worth of assets at their discretion are required to submit quarterly 13F reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Banks and fund managers have up to 45 days after a quarter ends to submit their reports. That includes foreign banks, like BNP Paribas, if they transact in the U.S., like buying ETFs from American issuers.A Goldman Sachs report published immediately after the U.S. SEC approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in January cautioned that, "Time to market and demand across institutional investors may not be immediate."That argument was backed up by Matt Hougan, CIO of crypto index fund manager Bitwise, who pointed out that, “The truth is, most professional investors still cannot buy bitcoin ETFs,” adding that, “That will change through a series of 100+ individual due diligence processes over the next two years.”Since their launch in January, Bitcoin ETFs have drawn in $11.2 billion in net inflows, per data from Farside Investors, despite over $17.4 billion in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).In recent days, Bitcoin ETFs have seen consistent outflows, with over $563 million in net outflows yesterday alone. The cash outs have come as the U.S. Federal Reserve elected to keep interest rates unchanged, causing investors to shy away from risk assets like stocks and crypto.BNP Paribas' decision to invest in Bitcoin ETFs represents something of an about-face.In September 2022, Sandro Pierri, head of fund management group BNP Paribas Asset Management, said that, "We are not involved in cryptocurrencies and we don't want to be involved," adding that the firm had "not heard significant interest" in crypto from its client base.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Friend​.tech v2 airdrop could introduce nontransferable token

Decentralized social media platform Friend.tech is preparing for its version two launch and airdrop on May 3, but a leaked smart contract suggests it may have controversial features, including a non-transferable token.The nontransferable tokens may be introduced with the airdrop, according to pseudonymous decentralized finance researcher CBBOFE, who claims in a May 2 X post to have potentially found the smart contracts.“Ticker is $POINT, not transferable unless to some whitelisted addresses. $POINT will be tradable on BunnySwap (FT native DEX).”A nontransferable token means that airdrop recipients won’t be able to sell or exchange the coins, except for certain whitelisted protocol addresses. Restaking protocol EigenLayer has also decided to issue a nontransferable token for its EIGEN airdrop, which was one of the main reasons behind the recent outrage surrounding EigenLayer.Friend.tech made the token nontransferable to make users pay the 1.5% fee, according to Kasper Vandeloock, a quantitative crypto trader and adviser at the X10 exchange. He told Cointelegraph:“If you can’t transfer it, you are forced to sell it through them, which has the 1.5% fee. […] Which is kind of ironic, they bring this strong ‘we are anti-VC’ vibe to the table while being a profit factory for Paradigm.”The new potential token, POINTS, will function as a utility token that allows for the creation of social clubs on the platform, which may cost a 1.5% platform fee, according to CBBFOE:“New smart-contract called Clubs. Anyone can create multiple clubs and a bonding curve among several options. 1.5% platform fee and 1.5% staking contract. Club keys are bought with $POINT.”The new tokens will also be offered as rewards for users staking their Ether (ETH) and POINTS tokens in the Friend.tech smart contract.The announcement caused concerns among crypto enthusiasts. Pseudonymous crypto trader MK commented:“I hate Eigen so much for starting this non-transferrable meta.”Related: EigenLayer sees over 12,000 queued withdrawals — How far will TVL fall?Non-transferable tokens could reduce initial airdrop selling pressureWhile nontransferable tokens have been causing significant community outrage, they could benefit the long-term price action of the cryptocurrency, as tokens tend to see drastic declines following airdrops.At the end of April, the Omni Network’s OMNI token fell 55% in less than 18 hours following it airdrop, losing over half of its market capitalization.Wormhole’s W token is another example, falling nearly 25% in value only a couple of hours after an airdrop on April 3. The token is down over 47% since the airdrop, according to CoinMarketCap.W/USDT, all-time chart. Source: CoinMarketCapCrypto airdrops are often riddled with professional airdrop hunters (or squatters) that farm the same airdrop with multiple cryptocurrency wallets with no intention of using the protocol in the long term and market selling the rewards after claiming.In March 2023, it was revealed that airdrop hunters consolidated $3.3 million worth of tokens from Arbitrum’s ARB airdrop from 1,496 wallets into just two wallets they had controlled.Related: LayerZero cross-chain interoperability protocol completes first airdrop snapshot

In a recent development that has stirred the XRP community, over $21 million worth of XRP has been transferred to popular crypto exchange Binance.The two transactions, which were flagged by the crypto tracking service Whale Alert, have sparked speculation regarding the intentions behind the sizable movement of funds.According to Whale Alert's tweets, the first transaction involved the transfer of 21.37 million XRP, equivalent to approximately $10.9 million at the time of the transfer, from an unknown wallet to Binance. Shortly after, another significant transfer was reported, with 21.34 million XRP, valued at around $10.9 million, moved to Binance from an undisclosed source. The timing of these transactions is particularly noteworthy, as they coincide with a period of significant volatility and uncertainty on the crypto market. XRP, in particular, has faced immense pressure in recent weeks, exacerbated by the broader downturn on the crypto market following a series of regulatory concerns and market corrections. It appears that these transactions may signal a sell-off by large XRP holders, commonly referred to as whales, who are offloading their holdings amid the bearish sentiment pervading the market. The recent crypto market crash has prompted investors to reassess their positions, with many opting to liquidate their assets to mitigate potential losses.XRP price shows resilienceDespite the prevailing bearishness, XRP has exhibited a degree of resilience in today's trading session. At the time of reporting, XRP is trading at $0.514, marking a 4.82% increase over the past 24 hours. While this uptick may not fully offset the losses incurred in recent weeks, it nonetheless suggests a degree of investor confidence in the digital asset amid challenging market conditions.In the end, the movements of large-scale investors such as whales remain closely scrutinized for potential insights into market sentiment and future price trajectories. Market participants will be closely monitoring developments to gauge the trajectory of XRP and other digital assets in the days ahead.

IQVIA Reports Revenue Growth to $3.74 Billion in Q1, Beats Forecasts - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



IQVIA Holdings Inc. (NYSE: IQV) has recently disclosed its financial outcomes for the first quarter of 2024, showcasing a solid performance across its diverse service segments. The company reported a revenue of $3,737 million, marking a 2.3 percent increase on a reported basis and a 2.9 percent increase at constant currency compared to the same period in 2023.



Particularly noteworthy was the Research & Development Solutions (R&DS) segment, which saw a revenue increase of 3.4 percent on a reported basis and 3.8 percent at constant currency. This segment, excluding the impact of pass-throughs, experienced a robust growth of 6.9 percent on a reported basis. The company’s contracted backlog in R&DS stood at an impressive $30.1 billion, up by 7.9 percent year-over-year. Approximately $7.7 billion of this backlog is expected to convert to revenue in the next twelve months. The first-quarter book-to-bill ratio was a healthy 1.23x, signaling strong future revenue potential.



IQVIA Holdings Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



IQVIA’s financial position remains strong, with cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.4 billion as of March 31, 2024. The company’s net debt was $12.09 billion, resulting in a net leverage ratio of 3.38x trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA. For the first quarter, IQVIA generated an operating cash flow of $522 million and a free cash flow of $377 million. These figures underscore the company’s robust financial health and ability to generate significant cash flows, further solidifying its position as a leader in providing advanced analytics, technology solutions, and clinical research services to the life sciences industry.



Analysts had projected an EPS of $2.48, whereas the company reported an adjusted diluted EPS of $2.54, slightly outperforming the expectations. However, the revenue of $3.74 billion comfortably exceeded the anticipated $3.7 billion, indicating a stronger-than-expected top-line growth. This performance is particularly commendable given the challenging global economic environment and underscores IQVIA’s operational resilience and the effectiveness of its business strategy.





IQVIA Expects Full Year Revenue to be Between $15.32 to $15.57 Billion



IQVIA has reaffirmed its full-year 2024 guidance, reflecting confidence in its business outlook despite the ongoing global uncertainties. The company expects full-year revenue to be in the range of $15.325 billion to $15.575 billion on a reported basis, considering the $75 million impact of the strengthening US dollar. This guidance suggests a growth rate of 2.3 to 3.9 percent, with a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 100 basis points.



Furthermore, IQVIA anticipates its full-year Adjusted EBITDA to be between $3,700 million and $3,800 million, representing a growth of 3.7 to 6.5 percent. The Adjusted Diluted EPS guidance is set at $10.95 to $11.25, indicating a year-over-year increase of 7.4 to 10.3 percent.

Popular Altcoin Introduced Its New Token, Price Mobilized! - Bitcoin Sistemi


AltLayer, which launched its altcoin ALT in January, announced that it launched its staking service in late March.
According to The Block, AltLayer introduced the Reborne ALT (reALT) token, stating that the second phase of the staking program has started.



In the statement, it was stated that Restaked ALT is an automatically compounded ERC-20 token given to users who stake ALT in AltLayer's main staking pool.
At this point, it was stated that investors who have already staked ALT in the staking pool can convert their stALT tokens (stake ALT) into reALT using AltLayer's staking portal tool.






“We are excited to open Phase II of AltLayer staking and the launch of Retaken ALT (reALT).
reALT is an auto-compounding ERC20 token that captures a holder's ALT staking contribution and accumulates compound rewards earned.
reALT token is issued to users who stake ALT in the main staking pool.
“The introduction of reALT is key to the AltLayer ecosystem and enables greater staker participation in preparation for the upcoming launch of MACH Alpha, a rapid finality service that will help secure and scale Layer 2 aggregations.”

'Rough day to be a Bitcoin ETF:' What's going on with BlackRock? - AMBCrypto



Fidelity eclipsed Grayscale in BTC ETF outflows on the 1st of May. 
BlackRock’s IBIT saw its first outflow as BTC struggled to reclaim $60K. 

Bitcoin’s [BTC] rough Q2 seems far from over. According to Soso Value data, US BTC ETFs recorded more outflows on the 1st of May, worth $563.7 million.
Surprisingly, Grayscale’s GBTC dominated outflows previously, but didn’t lead the outflows as Fidelity’s FBTC took center stage.  
Source: SoSo Value
BlackRock’s first outflow as Fidelity loses 2% of its BTC ETF assets
Out of the total outflows of $563.7 million, Fidelity’s FBTC led the outflows with $191.1 million, Farside data showed. 
Grayscale’s GBTC recorded the second-largest daily outflow on 1 May, worth $167.4 million. 
Bloomberg ETF analysts noted that Fidelity’s massive daily outflows were “huge” and almost worth 2% of its ETF assets, 
“Damn.. while it is like 2% of the ETF’s assets, but a) it’s big for Fidelity and b) all of them getting hit today looks like.”
Additionally, BlackRock’s IBIT, after hitting pause and going zero inflows for five days, saw its first outflow worth $36.9 million yesterday. 
Reacting to IBIT’s first outflow, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted, 
“Ruff day to be a #bitcoin ETF.”
The Fed rate decision didn’t help much with the sentiment either. BTC remained firmly below $60K after the Fed kept the interest rate unchanged. 
According to financial commentator Peter Schiff, BTC could drop to $54K after losing the $60K support. Schiff said,
“Notice on this shorter-term #Bitcoin chart that $60K, which was support, has become resistance.”

Bitcoin Spot ETFs Experience Record $564M Outflows, Expert Attributes It To 'Combination' Of Forces - ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF Common Shares of Beneficial Interests (BATS:ARKB), iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund Common Shares of Beneficial Interest (BATS:FBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Common Units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:GBTC) - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD spot ETFs recorded substantial net outflows on Wednesday, marking a significant realignment in investor sentiment.What Happened: According to data from SoSoValue, the total net outflow from these ETFs reached a record high of $564 million in a single day. Among the impacted, Grayscale‘s GBTC saw an outflow of $167 million, BlackRock‘s IBIT registered its first net outflow of $36.93 million, and Fidelity‘s FBTC experienced the most considerable withdrawal of $191 million. Ark’s ARKB saw a net outflow of $98.11 million.Amid these substantial outflows, Robert Quartly-Janeiro, Chief Strategy Officer at Bitrue, sheds light on the underpinnings of these market movements. He explains that the outflows are driven by a blend of prolonged high interest rates, geopolitical impacts and the recent peak market highs prompting investors to realize gains. “It's a combination of ‘higher for longer' interest rates, people realizing gains, geopolitical forces that impact equities, bonds and digital assets alike,” Quartly-Janeiro noted. Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Runes Could Transform Our Understanding Of Bitcoin, Experts Tell BenzingaHe emphasized that this represents not an existential crisis but a market dip where profit is being taken and the utility of investments is being scrutinized.When asked about the impact of these outflows on future market sentiment and investor confidence in cryptocurrency ETFs, Quartly-Janeiro pointed out the decline in investor confidence as reflected by the falling market cap. “Many bought and then sold the news ahead of the halving but it's important to remember that BTC is still at over $57,000 from the mid-teens it was at in January 2023,” he elaborated. The Chief Strategy Officer also highlighted the importance of identifying whether retail or institutional investors are driving the sell-off, as it would dictate the underlying reasons and strategies for future investment decisions.What’s Next: As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and respond to various economic and geopolitical stimuli, the significance of understanding these dynamics becomes crucial. This topic and more will be further explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, where industry experts, including Quartly-Janeiro, will discuss the implications of regulatory and economic factors on the future landscape of digital assets.Read Next: Why Bitcoin Might Drop Another 20%: 10x ResearchImage: Shutterstock

Shiba Inu Fees On Fire: What's Behind The 500% Surge?


								The cryptocurrency market continues its wild ride in 2024, with established giants like Bitcoin facing headwinds while seemingly outlandish projects like Shiba Inu experience unexpected growth spurts.

Bitcoin Struggles To Find Footing
Bitcoin, the undisputed king of crypto, has seen its price plummet in recent weeks. After flirting with record highs above $70,000 earlier this year, the leading cryptocurrency dipped below $58,000 on Wednesday, May 1st. This price drop comes amidst a broader market correction and growing concerns about rising inflation and potential interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
Shiba Inu Soars Despite Market Gloom
While Bitcoin licks its wounds, the meme-coin phenomenon Shiba Inu is experiencing a surprising resurgence. Transaction fees on Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution, skyrocketed by a staggering 500% over the past 24 hours.
This surge coincides with a 200% increase in active accounts on the network, suggesting a significant uptick in user engagement.
Source: Shibariumscan
Experts are divided on the reasons behind Shiba Inu’s recent rally. Some attribute it to the inherent volatility of meme coins, where social media hype can trigger rapid price fluctuations.
Others believe the burning mechanism built into Shibarium, where a portion of transaction fees are converted into SHIB tokens and sent to a dead wallet, is creating a perception of a decreasing supply, potentially driving up the price.

Total crypto market cap currently at $2.1 trillion. Chart: TradingView
What Does This Mean For The Future?
The contrasting fortunes of Bitcoin and Shiba Inu highlight the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin, with its established track record, is seen as a relatively safe haven by some, its vulnerability to broader economic forces remains evident.
On the other hand, Shiba Inu, despite its lack of intrinsic value, demonstrates the power of community and social media buzz in influencing prices.

The question remains: is Shiba Inu’s recent surge a temporary blip or a sign of a more sustained revival? The answer likely lies in the network’s ability to evolve beyond its meme-coin origins and offer real-world utility.
If Shibarium can attract developers and build a robust ecosystem of applications, it might carve out a niche in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. However, if it remains reliant solely on social media hype, its future could be as fleeting as the many dog-themed meme coins that have come and gone before it.
A Cautionary Lesson
The contrasting journeys of Bitcoin and Shiba Inu offer valuable lessons for crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. While Bitcoin serves as a reminder of the inherent risks associated with the volatile crypto market, Shiba Inu’s rise highlights the potential for disruptive innovation and community-driven growth.

Ultimately, the future of both projects will depend on their ability to adapt, innovate, and navigate the ever-changing landscape of digital assets.

WestRock Company (WRK) Reports Mixed Fiscal Q2 with $0.39 EPS - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



WestRock Company (NYSE: WRK), a leading provider of sustainable paper and packaging solutions, reported its fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2024, results, showcasing a mix of achievements and challenges in a competitive market landscape. Despite a decrease in net sales from $5.28 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to $4.73 billion in the current quarter, the company managed to post a net income of $15.5 million, a significant improvement from a net loss of $2.01 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. This recovery was attributed to the company’s aggressive cost savings initiatives, which have already exceeded its target range for fiscal 2024.



CEO David B. Sewell praised the team’s focus and execution, emphasizing the company’s better positioning in the market through efficiency improvements and innovative, sustainable packaging solutions. With over $160 million in cost savings and expectations to significantly exceed the fiscal 2024 target of $300 to $400 million, WestRock appears well on its way to capturing market share and driving long-term earnings growth. However, the decline in net sales was primarily driven by lower selling price/mix, affected by published price declines and softer volumes across its segments.



WestRock Beats EPS Expectations in Fiscal Q2, Revenue Miss



WestRock’s results present a nuanced picture when compared to expectations. Analysts had projected earnings per share (EPS) of $0.24 and revenue of $4.75 billion for the quarter. Actual EPS stood at $0.06, with adjusted EPS at $0.39, reflecting the impact of restructuring and other costs. Although the company fell short of revenue expectations by a slight margin, reporting $4.73 billion, the significant reduction in net loss compared to the previous year highlights effective cost management and operational adjustments. The decrease in net sales year-over-year was noted across all segments, with the Corrugated Packaging, Global Paper, and Consumer Packaging segments experiencing declines due to lower selling price/mix and volumes.





WestRock Refrains from Providing Specific Guidance



Looking ahead, WestRock has refrained from providing specific financial guidance for the upcoming periods, citing the ongoing preparations for its proposed business combination with Smurfit Kappa Group plc. This strategic move aims to create a global leader in sustainable packaging, with the transaction expected to close in early July 2024. The company’s decision not to issue guidance is to avoid potential delays in the transaction timeline due to regulatory submissions that might include financial forecasts. This approach underscores WestRock’s focus on the strategic merger, which is anticipated to enhance its competitive positioning and operational scale.

Jack Dorsey’s Block In Controversy Due To Regulatory Norm...


                                Dorsey's Block Involved in Illicit Crypto Transactions                                The United States investigators are currently examining Jack Dorsey’s Fintech Firm Block due to illegal Crypto transactions. Whistleblower states that Dorsey’s Block proceeded with many transactions linked to terrorist groups. What's the NewsFederal prosecutors in the United States are looking into Block, Inc., a company co-founded by Jack Dorsey. The investigation against the company is ongoing due to concerns about compliance violations within its payment platforms Square and Cash App. This investigation started after the Former Block employee from the Southern District of New York provided documents to investigators, informing that Square and Cash App platforms allowed thousands of transactions from users in countries facing U.S. economic sanctions. They even processed crypto transactions for strange illicit groups. These transactions through credit cards, fiat, and Bitcoin totaled around $57,805 on 2nd May. These transactions were allegedly not reported to the government as required.Dorsey’s Block Investigation and Shreds of Evidence  The Former Block employee of the company provided the documents claiming that Block didn't fix these compliance issues even after being alerted about them. This indicates serious problems in how the company handles regulations. Another unnamed source familiar with Block's internal operations supported these claims. Edward Siedle, a former SEC lawyer representing the anonymous sources, said that the top executives and the board at Block were aware of these compliance problems.However, an Attorney from Block’s side defended the company, saying they have a strong and flexible compliance program to deal with new challenges and changes in regulations, especially regarding sanctions.US Authorities Investigative Action on Other Crypto CompaniesThis investigation into Block, Inc. is happening at a time when U.S. authorities are cracking down on cryptocurrency companies. Recently, a case came across of Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao where the founder of Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange, was sentenced to a four-month imprisonment. Because Binance didn't maintain a proper Anti-Money Laundering program. Similarly, the founders of Samourai Wallet, a Bitcoin wallet service provider were arrested on suspicion of money laundering, although they denied the charges and were released on bail.In another development, Gary Gensler chief of SEC believed that ETH is an unregistered security. Consensys, a company working on Ethereum blockchain technology, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They accused the SEC of trying to control the future of cryptocurrency by targeting Ether, the cryptocurrency associated with Ethereum, as a security. This could have significant consequences for the entire cryptocurrency industry.ConclusionThese legal actions against cryptocurrency companies highlight the increasing attention and scrutiny from regulators. According to Coin Gabbar, authorities are focusing more on ensuring that these companies follow rules related to preventing money laundering and complying with securities laws. These developments highlight the challenges facing companies operating in the cryptocurrency space as they navigate complex regulatory landscapes and seek to maintain compliance while innovating in a rapidly evolving industry.Also Read: Dorsey’s Block Ventures Into Full Bitcoin Mining System

AI predicts Ethereum price for May 31, 2024


As the larger part of the cryptocurrency market begins to recover from the recent bearish hiccup, Ethereum (ETH) is no exception, but artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms currently do not see this recovery as a bullish sign for the crypto asset in the next several weeks.
Indeed, the second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization is slowly pushing back up toward retaking the $3,000 level it had lost earlier this week after nearly two months of trading above it, following the most active day on its network for at least one year, according to the most recent charts.
Ethereum price prediction May 2024
However, despite such positive signs for Ethereum, the advanced AI algorithms do not see its price troubles ending by the end of this month, projecting it to drop to $2,534.25 by May 31, 2024, as per the latest data offered by the crypto monitoring and forecasting platform PricePredictions on May 2.

In other words, the algorithms predict that Ethereum will decline by 15.33% from its present situation, taking into account technical analysis (TA) indicators, such as the relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and others.
Ethereum price analysis
At the moment, Ethereum is changing hands at the price of $2,993.07, which suggests an increase of 3.57% in the last 24 hours, having lost 3.80% across the previous seven days and accumulating a dip of 10.78% over the past month, as per the latest data.

Meanwhile, renowned crypto trading expert Ali Martinez has observed positive signals for Ethereum, highlighting that April 29 was the most successful day for the growth of its network in over a year, having recorded 139,560 new ETH addresses, as he explained in an X post on May 2.
Ethereum network activity. Source: Ali Martinez
As Martinez earlier pointed out, Ethereum is facing a strong resistance level at $3,200, which has emerged as a significant barrier due to, in part, the substantial holdings of approximately 2.34 million addresses collectively owning 5.14 million ETH purchased at this average price.

That said, a pseudonymous crypto influencer with a large following on social media, Mister Crypto, expects Ethereum to hit the price target of at least $10,000 at some point in the next run while also envisioning other crypto assets, like Bitcoin (BTC) at $100,000 and Solana (SOL) at $1,000.

In conclusion, Ethereum could, indeed, proceed to drop toward the low price target predicted by the AI algorithms, although some crypto analysts might disagree, highlighting the importance of doing one’s own research before investing a significant amount of money in any asset.

Meme Cryptocurrencies Face Steep Declines: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE Suffer Major Setbacks in Market Value



                    

Dogecoin (DOGE), a leading cryptocurrency inspired by memes, experienced a significant downturn, losing over 12% of its value in the last 24 hours. 



The price of DOGE, a favorite of tech mogul Elon Musk, has decreased by more than 23% over the past week and by 40% within the last month.




Currently, DOGE’s market price hovers around $0.1245. This marks an 83% decline from its peak value of $0.737, recorded on May 8, 2021. 



Despite this setback, the trading volume of Dogecoin surged by 75% in the last day, reaching $1.7 billion, with its market capitalization now at $18 billion.



Shiba Inu (SHIB), another popular meme cryptocurrency, also faced challenges, with its price dropping by 12% in the same 24-hour period. 



This recent fall adds to a 22% decrease over the past week.

Nevertheless, Shiba Inu has seen a significant 134% rise over the last 90 days, reflecting sustained investor interest despite shifting market sentiments.



Shiba Inu is currently priced at $0.000021, with a 24-hour trading volume that increased by 50% to $833 million. SHIB’s market cap stands at approximately $12.3 billion.




A newer meme coin, PEPE, has also felt the market’s volatility. 



After a remarkable 560% rise in the last 90 days, PEPE has seen a 22% decrease over the past week, with an additional 16% drop in the last 24 hours.




PEPE’s current trading price is $0.000006, and its trading volume over the last day rose by 28% to $980 million. 



Despite recent declines, PEPE remains the third-largest meme cryptocurrency, boasting a market cap of $2.58 billion.



These fluctuations in the meme cryptocurrency sector underscore the inherent volatility and the shifting dynamics influenced by both investor sentiment and broader market trends.

Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Analysts Predict Upside Following 20% Decline | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, is experiencing a massive downturn. However, popular crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe has predicted that the cryptocurrency may be at the end of its correction, foreseeing potential upsides following a price bottom. 
Analyst Suggests Bitcoin Bottom Closing In
In an X (formerly Twitter) post on Wednesday, May 1, Poppe declared that Bitcoin was at the end of its correction phase, suggesting that the cryptocurrency’s anticipated bottom was finally closing in. 

The crypto analyst disclosed that BTC was down by 20% from its all-time highs in March 2024, predicting further declines possibly driven by market volatility and investor sentiment. As of writing, the price of the cryptocurrency is trading at $57,719, reflecting a weekly decline of 9.53%, according to CoinMarketCap.
Poppe further confirmed on May 2 that Bitcoin had largely completed its downward trend. He anticipates another 5% to 10% dip, clarifying that it may take some time before the cryptocurrency recovers and gets back to its previous bullish momentum.  
Sharing a price chart depicting Bitcoin/Tether (USDT) price movements from October 2023 to September 2024, Poppe highlighted special green zones between $56,000 and $58,000 to monitor. He explained that these levels could serve as crucial support zones for a potential upside if Bitcoin’s price correction persists. 
Despite the pessimistic outlook, the potential for a price rebound could emerge if BTC hits its bottom, as historically declines to lower levels have often preceded upsides.
Sharing a similar sentiment, crypto analyst, Ali Martinez has revealed that Bitcoin’s TD Sequential indicator on a 4-hour price chart was displaying a buy signal. He predicts that a rebound lasting between one to four candlesticks is expected for Bitcoin. 
Altcoins Set To Take Over As BTC Plummets
In his post, Poppe revealed that during Bitcoin’s period of consolidation, altcoins could see increased activity, potentially taking over the market until BTC breaks all-time high. The crypto analyst highlighted a recurring pattern, suggesting that Bitcoin tends to undergo a price correction before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with the price settling into a neutral position once the FOMC session concludes. 

Poppe has stated that following the FOMC meeting, he expects BTC to consolidate and go sideways while altcoins heavily outperform as rotation kicks in. He has also suggested that the present market condition characterized by BTC’s decline makes it a favorable time for investors to buy altcoins.
“Bitcoin reaching sub $57,000 pre-FOMC as tonights’ FOMC is one of the biggest ones of the year. I expect us to bottom anywhere soon. Altcoins have bottomed already, and I think that’s where you’ll find the ROI,” Poppe stated.

Biden vs Bitcoin: What all is at stake as U.S. election 2024 nears - AMBCrypto



SEC’s crypto involvement raises questions about partisan regulation in upcoming elections.
Darius Dale expects Biden-aligned policies in budget deficit financing.

Apart from the Bitcoin [BTC] halving, the US 2024 election stands as one of the most anticipated events of this year. 
Despite remarkable progress within the crypto industry under President Joe Biden’s administration, regulatory challenges persist. 
Notably, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) increased involvement in the crypto sphere prompts speculation: Will the widening partisan gap in crypto regulation influence the approach taken in the 2024 elections?
Senator Lummis criticizes DOJ’s Bitcoin stance
Amidst these looming concerns, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis recently criticized the Department of Justice (DOJ) for its interpretation of regulations concerning non-custodial software wallets.  
Voicing her apprehension on the same, Senator Lummis took to X (Formerly Twitter) and noted, 
“I am deeply concerned by the Biden administration criminalizing core tenants of the Bitcoin network and decentralized finance.’ 
She added, 
Source: Senator Cynthia Lummis/Twitter
The dispute emerged when the DOJ charged developers linked to Bitcoin mixers like Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash. These activities were deemed unauthorized money transmission by the DOJ.
Senator Lummis’s comment highlights the contradictory DOJ’s approach against past Treasury guidance, potentially criminalizing core aspects of Bitcoin and DeFi operations. 
Insights from Darius Dale
Separately in an interview with Anthony Pompliano, Darius Dale, CEO of 42Macro, discussed the impact of various developments on the crypto market and elections. 
Shedding light on the potential influence of President Biden’s administration on Treasury policy, particularly regarding how the budget deficit is financed. Dale said, 
“The Treasury knows the budget deficit is going to be, but how they choose to finance the budget deficit is sort of a discretionary.” 
This underlines the positive relationship between Secretary Janet Yellen and Joe Biden, and an expectation for policies that align with the administration’s objectives. 
Stock market trends
Historical data indicates that the stock market tends to exhibit strong performance in the period leading up to the presidential elections. In 2024, this trend is notably exceeding historical averages.
Source: Investing.com
Needless to say, Dale emphasized the importance of understanding the interplay between sticky inflation and Treasury policy responses and claimed, 
“We know we’re kind of very much in that debate process, but the early indications of that debate process are certainly moving in a hawkish direction.”

Analyst Forecasts Bullish Breakout for Shiba Inu Amidst Big Moves


							

A massive movement of 2 trillion SHIB tokens from Robinhood to an undisclosed wallet raises eyebrows, sparking speculation.



Analyst predicts a breakout for SHIB, targeting $0.000072323, advising buy orders around $0.000018343 to capitalize.



Inadvertent burns of 2 billion SHIB tokens reduce circulating supply, potentially boosting demand and price pressure.




Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracker, identified a big movement of Shiba Inu (SHIB) meme currencies on the famous investment site Robinhood. Nearly two trillion SHIB tokens were moved to an unidentified wallet, raising questions in the crypto world.







Over the past eight hours, a mysterious wallet identified as -4D935 has acquired two massive chunks, each containing 875 billion SHIB tokens, totaling 1.75 trillion SHIB. This transaction, valued at $39.2 billion, has sparked speculation about the intentions behind the transfer.



Meanwhile, cryptocurrency expert Ali Charts has seen a bullish pattern building on the daily trading chart of SHIB. Ali predicts a potential breakout for SHIB, targeting the $0.000072323 level. To capitalize on this anticipated surge, Ali suggests placing buy orders around the $0.000018343 price mark.







Despite the positive outlook, the Shiba Inu community suffered a setback in April when over two billion SHIB tokens were unintentionally burnt. According to Shibburn explorer, a total of 1,695,717,536 SHIB tokens were deemed unspendable owing to mistakes in transactions. These tokens, worth millions, were irretrievably lost, serving as a warning to investors to double-check wallet addresses before transferring funds.









The inadvertent burns significantly reduced the circulating supply of SHIB tokens, potentially impacting its market dynamics. As a result, the shortage caused by these burns may lead to greater demand and rising price pressure for SHIB in the future.



According to the latest reports, the price of Shiba Inu has been revealed to be $0.000022 while the stated hourly trade volume is $822,779,927. SHIB has climbed 4.00% over the last 24 hours to confirm increased investor appeal towards the meme currency. The performance is also reflected in the live market capitalization whose high value is over $12 billion and the total number of coins circulating of more than 589 trillion SHIB.

Web3 Publishing Platform Mirror Sells to Paragraph, Pivots to Social App 'Kiosk'

Paragraph founder Colin Armstrong says that his product differed from Mirror, at least initially, in that it tried to appeal more to a Web2 audience. Armstrong, who has written for tech publications in addition to working as an engineer at Google and Coinbase, says he also focused his product more on referral programs and other features to help authors widen their distribution. Mirror, meanwhile, managed to develop a stronger brand and design language, said Armstrong.

XLM vs ADA: Similarities and Differences



                    

Both Stellar and Cardano are crypto protocols with a long history in the ecosystem. They have evolved throughout the years and adapted to the changes and demands of the market. Let’s take a look at their similarities and differences, to find out which of them is a better investment. Then, you can decide if it’s the right time to purchase the tokens or if it’s best to do an HNT to IOTA swap at the moment.



XLM vs ADA: Similarities



XLM is the ticker of Lumens, the token of the Stellar blockchain. ADA, on the other hand, is the token of the Cardano blockchain. They share plenty of similarities. However, their approaches to various topics on crypto development are different. It’s important to take a deep dive into these factors before deciding which is the winner in the XLM vs ADA battle.




Smart Contracts



Smart contracts are the backbone of modern blockchains. Even protocols that weren’t created with this feature in mind have changed their software to include them, for the benefits they bring regarding the development of DApps. That’s the case with Stellar. In the beginning, it was intended to be a platform for cross-border payments, connecting banks and traditional payment systems. Although that feature still exists, Stellar now introduced smart contracts, allowing users to build DApps on top of it. Cardano, on the other hand, had this feature in mind for a while but didn’t deploy it until 2021.



Decentralization



Blockchain technology is intended to be decentralized and transparent, and protocols built using this architecture should follow suit. Stellar achieves decentralization by allowing anyone to create a node and participate in the consensus protocol. However, some critics argue the core development team still makes most decisions.



Cardano also encourages users to run network nodes and participate in protocol governance. Block consensus is reached using a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm, where anyone can participate.




Interoperability



The Stellar blockchain allows users to tokenize fiat currencies and assets, as well as transfer them. Moreover, it is designed to interconnect with other payment systems and banks. Anyone can use the protocol to build their own payment system using smart contracts, and these DApps would be compatible with one another.



Cardano focuses on interoperability with centralized banks as well. However, it also supports integrations with other blockchains, like Ethereum. This means that DApps developed on Cardano can be migrated to Ethereum and vice versa.



XLM vs ADA: Differences



Despite the similarities, Stellar and Cardano have differences both in their intended use and their technical infrastructure.



Use Cases



Stellar, as we mentioned, is mainly focused on providing a means for money transfers. You can get tokenized dollars and euros, but also Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. It has developed integrations with large apps, like MoneyGram, to bring the benefits of crypto to its users.




Cardano, as an Ethereum competitor, is focused on providing users with tools to build DApps and foster the creation of an internal ecosystem, with the ability to perform any function needed, growing based on the needs of its users.



Consensus Mechanism



Unlike most blockchains, XLM cannot be mined or staked. All XLM tokens were created at the time of launch and distributed evenly in the following five years. No network participant receives token rewards now, neither by staking nor mining. Still, users are encouraged to run servers and contribute with the validation of transactions.



Cardano uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm called Ouroboros. Stakers must participate in staking pools, and block validation is assigned randomly among pools. The reward is then distributed between the stakers.



Development Approach



A defining feature of Cardano is its reliance on peer-reviewed papers. All the technical documents of the blockchain are peer-reviewed and approved independently. While this improves Cardano’s security and performance, it has caused it to stay behind in innovation, even if it started developing the features before other competitors.



Stellar, on the other hand, is not as tightly connected to the scientific fields. Developments come from the core development team and other collaborators and are promptly deployed on the main network.



XLM vs ADA: Which Is a Better Investment?



As we’ve seen, both cryptos are solid and successful. They’re both among the most valuable by market capitalization, although Cardano ranks higher. The decision on which is a better investment depends on what you need it for. However, the Cardano blockchain is probably a better financial investment, judging by its current value and the activity of its deve

In this article, we will consider whether it is worth investing in TRON in 2024 and review its value forecast for the coming years.



                    

Tron is one of the leading cryptocurrencies in the market. It is currently ranked #12 by market value and top 30 by daily trading volume. It’s focused on the development of DApps using smart contracts, like many other projects in the ecosystem.



However, there are specific features that distinguish it from some of its competitors. If you’re thinking of investing in Tron, let’s take a deep dive into its features and market predictions. Then, you can either purchase some tokens or swap them. Using exchanges, you can trade XEM to TRX or any other pair using the tokens you already own.




TRON Overview



The Tron project is similar to Ethereum, Solana, and other DApp-focused blockchains. In fact, it was initially launched as a token on the Ethereum blockchain, in 2017. It was successful from the beginning and, one year later, it migrated to its own blockchain. You can also compare SOL vs TRX to find out what are the differences and similarities between these blockchains.



Tron supports the creation of smart contracts, which can be used to develop any kind of DApps, such as exchanges, marketplaces, or video games. In 2019, Tron’s CEO, Justin Sun, acquired BitTorrent and launched the BTT token shortly after.



TRX Blockchain & Consensus Mechanism



The Tron blockchain architecture is quite similar to others like Ethereum. However, it is differentiated by the use of the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm. New blocks are created every three seconds and validated by stakers known as Super Representatives (SR). Super Representatives are stakers who are voted by other network members. A new group of SRs is chosen every six hours. The mining reward is distributed between super representatives and the stakers who voted for them.




TRX DApps & Smart Contracts



Tron features smart contracts, like its competitors, to foster the creation of DApps on the blockchain. The building environment is called the TRON Virtual Machine (TVM), and it is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means that applications built on Ethereum can be compatible with the Tron blockchain. Ethereum is the largest smart contract-focused blockchain, so it makes sense to start with it. But in the future, the Tron team plans to make other blockchains compatible as well.



TRON Price Prediction



The TRX token has had a great market run since its inception. It launched around September 2017 and, by January 5th, it had increased by over 11,000%, when it reached its all-time high. The price quickly fell, but this initial push, along with the appropriate technical and marketing decisions, has kept the price afloat and thriving. Despite the usual surges followed by sudden drops, the price has sustained an upward trend, and it is expected to follow in the coming years.



TRX Price Forecast for 2024



TRX’s price is currently around $0.119, and market analysts predict that it will be around $0.1624 and $0.23 throughout 2024, a growth ranging between 40% and 90%. This claim isn’t unsustained because, since May 2023, the price of TRX has been climbing steadily, increasing 85% in the last 12 months. This trend isn’t unlikely to drop soon, because both the community and the developers are active on the network.



TRX Price Forecast for 2025-2030



According to market experts, the subsequent years will also follow a similar pattern, with yearly gains of around 40% and 50%.




YearAverage price2025$0.25072026$0.36312027$0.51402028$0.63042029$0.83002030$1.1750



Is TRX Worth Investing In?



Tron is definitely one of the most valuable projects in the crypto ecosystem, and the TRX token is a highly profitable investment. While the safest advice is to do your own research and only invest what you are willing to lose, we can say that TRX is one of the tokens that can be considered a good idea to invest in and expect great returns.

The 11 ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $563.7 million, marking the largest outflow since the funds began trading on January 11.


According to data from Farside Investors and CoinGlass, approximately $1.2 billion has been withdrawn from ETFs since April 24, continuing a five-day losing streak.
Fidelity's FBTC led the outflows on Wednesday with $191.1 million in withdrawals.





This development could be cause for concern for bulls, as FBTC and BlackRock's IBIT steadily attracted funds in the first quarter, offsetting regular large outflows from the relatively costly Grayscale ETF (GBTC).

GBTC had the second biggest exit on Wednesday with $167.4 million, followed by ARKB with $98.1 million and IBIT with $36.9 million.


These outflows came despite Powell's clearly dovish approach, which typically favors risk assets including Bitcoin. As expected, the FED kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5%.
While Powell reassured that the economy is solid enough not to require a rate cut, he also eased fears of new interest rate hikes or liquidity tightening caused by recent disappointing inflation numbers.

$10 trillion investment giant outlines tomorrow’s Bitcoin bulls


In the first year of the ‘crypto winter,’ pension funds – specifically Canadian pension funds – found themselves making headlines in various crypto outlets as they ended their cryptocurrency forays either before they began in earnest or after suffering major losses as companies like Celsius collapsed.
Things have quieted down since for large institutional investors – at least with regard to the crypto markets – albeit with some exceptions, such as Vanguard’s acquisition of a large stake in Bitcoin (BTC) miners.
This year, however, brought a massive change to the dynamic as in January, after years of waiting, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 9 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), seemingly opening the floodgates for crypto-wary investors to gain exposure using familiar vehicles.


BlackRock foresees massive institutional investors trading BTC ETFs
According to BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, the investment giant now expects BTC ETFs to see the coming of massive new and returning investors – Pension Funds, Sovereign Wealth Funds, and Endowments.
As of May 2024, BlackRock is reportedly playing the role of an educator for such institutional investors in hopes of attracting them to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and is seeing a general resurgence in interest from such entities.
At the time of publication, BlackRock operates tha second-largest Bitcoin ETF – the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) – which boasts approximately $17 billion in assets under management (AUM).
The financial giant is also working on closer relations with sovereign wealth funds – specifically the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund – albeit, at this stage, unrelated to the world’s premier cryptocurrency and is reportedly setting up the BlackRock Riyadh Investment Management (BRIM).
Headwinds or tailwinds?
While the approval of the ETFs certainly brought benefits for institutional Bitcoin adoption, the cryptocurrency’s continued volatility could still present a major roadblock for entities such as pension funds.
Indeed, the world’s premier cryptocurrency has been experiencing significant fluctuations in recent weeks as it has been trading in a relatively wide range between just under $57,000 and slightly over $70,000 without any guarantees about its forthcoming trend – though recent technical analysis (TA) hints at an imminent rally.
Still, the risks may ultimately not turn away major investors and traders as evidenced by two significant wealth managers  – Legacy Wealth Management and United Capital Management of Kansas – recently disclosing substantial stakes in BTC ETFs.

Pi Coin Price And Estimation Before The Mainnet Launch Da...


                                Pi Coin Price Touched $47 Prior to Mainnet Launch Date                                The mainnet of Pi Network is likely to be launched on June 28, 2024, but before the network mainnet goes live, there is a surge in the price of its Pi Coin. According to the information, Pi Coin is trading near its IOU price of $47 on major charting platforms. However, at present Pi Coin has no value because its mainnet has not been launched yet. In such a situation, this coin cannot be sold. The team associated with Pi Network has also announced that as soon as the network reaches 15 million KYC users, the mainnet of the network will go live.Currently, Pi Network has crossed the milestone of 10 million users KYC. Since then there has been a lot of enthusiasm in the Pi community. However, in the meantime, a race has started among the users holding large amounts of Pi Coin to find ways to sell this coin. Scammers have got the opportunity to take advantage of this hustle and bustle and they are targeting users holding Pi Coin.How to determine the value of Pi Coin before the Mainnet Launch?The most important process for the network's open mainnet to go live is to complete the KYC process for its 15 million users. Pi Coin has yet to cross the figure of about 5 million users because KYC of 10 million users has been done on the network. But still, the question arises how has the price of Pi reached $47? So, here’s the answer to the question. When the mainnet goes live, nothing like Pi Coin can be considered, that is, the mined Pi Network token has no value at present. But the Pi Network is currently testnet. Hence, there are Pi Coin IOUs traded on crypto exchanges like HTX and BitMart as traders exchange promissory notes in place of real tokens. In such a situation, the entire Pi Coin market is currently based only on speculation.Users becoming victims of scams due to Pi CoinThere is a lot of buzz on social media about Pi Coin, but its users who have become holders of this coin by mining it through the app, are now looking for ways to sell this token. Pi holders are also searching on social media to sell their tokens. Scammers are taking advantage of this activity of Pi holders and there has also been an increase in fraudulent activities by creating fake websites and fake accounts with Pi Coin holders on social media platforms. In such a situation, it is essential to be cautious while buying Pi Coin. Pi holders should take special care that this Pi Coin cannot be traded until the Pi network mainnet is launched. In such a situation, do not fall into any trap related to buying Pi Coin.Also Read: Pi Day Celebration and Emerging Pi Network Popularity

European Banking Giant BNP Paribas Buys Shares in Spot Bitcoin ETF | Cryptoglobe


                                
BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe whose asset management arm has over $600 billion in assets under management, has gained exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) via a spot exchange-traded fund.



According to a recent 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the bank has purchased shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), as first reported by Bitcoin Magazine.



Large institutional investors managing over $100 million in assets have to, every quarter, disclose their holdings via 13F filings and after the successful launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., these filings have been closely watched by industry sleuths.







While previous filings for the first quarter of 2024 showcased purchases by asset managers, family offices, and several smaller banks, BNP Paribas’ involvement marks a turning point even though the bank allocated a miniscule part of its holdings to the flagship cryptocurrency, acquiring around $40,000 worth of it.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Analysts anticipate that further 13F filings leading up to the May 15th deadline could reveal a broader presence of institutional investors within the spot Bitcoin ETF landscape.



As CryptoGlobe reported, recent market volatility has put a spotlight on spot Bitcoin ETFs, with several experiencing record-high discounts to their net asset value (NAV) after Bitcoin itself saw a significant price drop. This raises questions about the unique challenges of these investment vehicles in a volatile market.



ETF analyst James Seyffart notes that while these discounts aren’t unprecedented, they do stand out given the historical range of premiums and discounts for these funds. Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise, attributes the dislocations to factors like end-of-month rebalancing and Bitcoin’s price-calculation mechanisms used by ETFs, which can lead to discrepancies between market prices and these funds’ NAV.

Crucial Bitcoin On-Chain Metric Just Hinted at Strong Recovery

A critical look at on-chain metrics provides new insights suggesting a potential strong recovery on the horizon for Bitcoin, following the drop below $60,000. The "Bitcoin Fundamental Index" by Swissblock, which is a composite measure of various Bitcoin network health indicators, recently hit what appears to be an inflection point, signaling potential upward movement for Bitcoin's price.One of the key metrics to consider is the Short-Term Holder MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value), which currently stands at 0.96. This ratio essentially compares the market value (the current price at which Bitcoin is trading) to the realized value (the average price at which coins were last moved). A value below one typically indicates that short-term holders are holding coins at a loss, which can signal a potential bottom if other conditions align.BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewWhen the STH-MVRV has dipped below one, it has typically been a precursor to a market recovery as it suggests that the selling pressure from short-term holders is waning and could indicate that sellers are exhausted. This exhaustion is further supported by the recent performance of the Bitcoin Fundamental Index, which shows a recovery from lower levels, suggesting increased network growth and investor confidence.Looking at the "Bitcoin Fundamental Index" chart, there have been significant spikes in the index correlating closely with increases in Bitcoin's price. The index itself measures several aspects of network health, including transaction volume, wallet activity and other undisclosed proprietary indicators that aim to gauge the overall sentiment and fundamental strength of Bitcoin.The current index value is nearing the higher end of its recent range. Historically, such patterns have indicated strong bullish sentiment building up, especially when combined with a low STH-MVRV.

Whales Dive In, But Dogecoin Price Sinks 20%: What's Going On?


                            Dogecoin (DOGE), the Shiba Inu-faced darling of the 2021 memecoin frenzy, has found itself shivering in the current crypto winter. Once a symbol of retail investor exuberance, DOGE has plummeted over 70% from its sky-high peak, leaving its future shrouded in uncertainty.

DOGE Feels The Crypto Frost
While Bitcoin, the heavyweight champion of the crypto world, grabs headlines with its recent wobble, the impact on memecoins like DOGE has been brutal. Unlike Bitcoin’s divided analyst opinions, the sentiment surrounding DOGE is decidedly bearish.
At the time of writing, the memecoin was trading at $0.132, down 5.4% up the last 24 hours but sustained a 20% loss in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows.

Is DOGE A Canary In The Crypto Coal Mine?
Some analysts believe DOGE’s struggles are a canary in the coal mine for the entire crypto market. They said if even a historically high-flying memecoin like Dogecoin can’t hold onto gains, it raises serious concerns about risk appetite in the crypto space in general.

Dogecoin market cap currently at $18 billion. Chart: TradingView.com
Whales Accumulating DOGE: A Glimmer Of Hope?
However, a glimmer of hope flickers for the dethroned meme king. On-chain data suggests an increase in large wallet purchases of DOGE, hinting at potential accumulation by wealthy investors. This “contrarian” behavior could be a sign that some whales are using Coinglass or similar platforms to track Dogecoin derivatives and believe the coin is undervalued and ripe for a comeback.
Source: Coinglass
Coinglass, a popular cryptocurrency data provider, offers insights into factors that might be influencing the whales’ decisions. By analyzing metrics like open interest, funding rates, and liquidations on Coinglass, these investors might see an opportunity to buy DOGE at a discount.

In a similar development, Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain tracker, has reported that a DOGE whale arranged two large transactions in a single day. Some 150,000,000 Dogecoins were transferred in the first transaction, and an additional 76,316,694 DOGE were transferred in the second, for a total of almost 226 million DOGE. At the time, the meme cryptocurrency was worth around $40 million in fiat money.

Can Dogecoin Thaw The Crypto Winter?
The coming weeks will be critical for DOGE. The return of positive social media sentiment, coupled with continued accumulation by whales who might be strategically using Coinglass for market analysis, could be the spark that reignites the DOGE rally. However, if the broader market weakness persists, DOGE’s summer might be spent shivering in the doghouse.

Jerome Powell's Market Message Decoded by Jim Cramer, What It Means for Crypto

CNBC's Mad Money host Jim Cramer recently shared his take on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks from the Fed's two-day meeting that just ended.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that raising interest rates was unlikely to be the Fed's next action. Officials would need to see compelling evidence that the policy is not tight enough to bring inflation back to its 2% target. Cramer told investors to believe Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when he hinted on Wednesday that a rate hike was improbable, despite persistent inflation.Although Powell's comments temporarily calmed the markets, Cramer indicated that investors might become concerned again as job data will be announced on Friday. The numbers could provide more information about whether the economy is slowing or accelerating.Even though Powell stopped short of signaling rate cuts were likely this year or that rates were at a peak, Cramer said that the Fed chief had managed to take "the dreaded rate hike scenario off the table." Given Cramer's history of making predictions that turn out contrary, particularly in the crypto market, this raises the question of the implications of the recent developments on the macro front for cryptocurrencies. Implications for cryptocurrenciesHistorically, Bitcoin has had four April declines in the last decade, three of which foreshadowed May losses of 18% on average, according to Bloomberg data.Still, if inflation pressures ease and markets resume bets on a much looser Fed stance, cryptocurrencies and other speculative assets may see some respite.The Fed has maintained interest rates steadily in the 5.25%-5.5% range for nearly nine months, and Powell's statements did not imply that the central bank is inclined to drop rates anytime soon.It is unusual for interest rates to hold steady for more than a year. That said, the lagging impact of higher-for-longer rates remains a concern for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. This could be a tail risk that might keep bulls at bay.

Exverse Amps for Alpha with Big Token Listing and Tournament - DailyCoin


        
Exverse is setting the stage for its alpha launch.  



The web3 first-person shooter has secured major token listings and more in preparation for its launch. 



Exverse hints at further announcements, keeping excitement levels high.
Exverse, one of the most exciting web3 first-person-shooters, is only weeks away from its alpha launch. It is already moving with full force, marking key accomplishments, from bagging token listings on some of the world’s leading exchanges to hosting tournaments for players to battle for exciting prizes. Exverse Bags Major Token Listings Ahead of LaunchExverse is gearing up for its highly anticipated full alpha launch of its competitive PVP first-person shooter in mid-May, and it’s pulling out all the stops to make a grand entrance. On April 24, it made headlines by launching its native token EXVG on Bybit, a major crypto exchange with over 20 million users.Expressing their enthusiasm about the token launch, Fei Ooi Hoong, CEO of Exverse, shared, 
“We are extremely excited about our token launch and proud to work with a great partner like ByBit to make it happen,” “We worked tirelessly to develop a diverse, engaging, and intuitive first-person shooter capable of revolutionizing how the public views blockchain-based gaming. Our talented team tapped into its background in traditional gaming to develop a rich and immersive gaming experience and then strategically implemented the NFT elements and in-game economics to enhance the user experience.” Hoong continued. In addition to landing its token on Bybit, it has also secured listing on other major exchanges such as Mexc, Gate.io, and Bitpanda. Beyond that, Exverse has also been laser-focused on enhancing its game, making it an enjoyable experience for players. Exverse’s Focus on GamingLearning from trends set in 2022, where web3 games often prioritized crypto elements over gameplay, Exverse took a different approach by providing users with an immersive gaming experience. To showcase their platform, Exverse organized a thrilling tournament, allowing players to engage in high-octane battles and compete for EXVG.In anticipation of its alpha launch, Exverse treated 5,000 early waitlist members to an exclusive deathmatch-style tournament on April 15. Spanning five days, the tournament offered participants a glimpse into the adrenaline-fueled world of “Battle Planet,” where they could showcase their skills and vie for rewards in stablecoins and tokens.
With $50,000 in total up for grabs, the top 100 performers earned at least $200. Top five finishers earnings were dispersed accordingly:
1st place: $4,000



2nd place: $2,000



3rd place: $1,500



4th and 5th place: $1,000

Throughout the five action-packed days, adrenaline-fueled battles unfolded, witnessing over 60,000 intense matches and an astounding 1 million eliminations, of which a significant portion were headshot and grenade kills. As the hype around the game continues to rise, Exverse has also hinted at a potential launch on Epic Games, stirring up even more excitement. While details on the development remain under wraps for now, the prospect of Exverse expanding its reach to one of the biggest gaming platforms in the industry is enough to set pulses racing with anticipation.On the Flipside
Many major web3 companies like Yuga Labs shut down many of their web3 gaming projects, citing that they didn’t fit their vision. 



Despite web3 games collectively securing over $2 billion in funding in 2023, CoinGecko reported that three in four web3 games failed between 2018 and 2023. 
Why This MattersExverse’s recent accomplishments and preparations highlight its commitment to delivering an exceptional experience ahead of its alpha launch. By securing listings on major exchanges and organizing tournaments, Exverse demonstrates its dedication to creating a dynamic and immersive platform for players, positioning itself for a solid debut in the Web3 ecosystem. The FOMC’s decision to hold rates shakes the crypto market:Cardano Slips to Demand Zone After FOMC Holds Rates SteadySolana founder defends memecoins:Solana Founder Sneers at Claims of Memecoin Scaring Builders

Apple to Report Earnings After Market Close, What to Expect - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) will report its fiscal second-quarter earnings on May 2, 2024, after the market closes. Analysts expect the tech giant to post earnings per share (EPS) of $1.50, slightly lower than the $1.52 reported in the same quarter a year ago. The company is projected to generate revenues of $90.36 billion, marking a decrease from the previous year’s figures.



Apple’s Upcoming Earnings: Key Details and Expectations



As the earnings announcement approaches, investors and analysts will closely monitor key performance metrics, including iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The market sentiment surrounding Apple’s earnings is relatively low, given the company’s recent underperformance and a significant year-to-date stock price decline.





What to Look Out for in Apple’s Upcoming Earnings Results



One of the most critical focus areas will be iPhone sales, which are expected to decline compared to the same quarter last year. The Chinese market, where sales have been feeble, will be under the microscope. Another critical segment to watch is services revenue, which has been a growth area for Apple and contributes significantly to overall profits. Growth in this segment will be a crucial indicator of the company’s overall health.



Updates on Apple’s AI initiatives and any new AI integrations will also be closely watched, as they could impact future growth trajectories. Additionally, forward-looking statements and guidance for upcoming quarters will be crucial for assessing future performance expectations. Potential announcements regarding stock buyback programs or dividend changes could influence investor sentiment and the stock price.



As of the time of writing, Apple’s stock price was approximately $171.94, experiencing a slight increase of 1.56% in early trading hours. However, the stock has seen a decline of about 10.57% year-to-date, underperforming relative to broader market indices like the S&P 500.



Despite recent declines, Apple’s market capitalization remains around $2.61 trillion, maintaining its position as one of the largest companies by market cap. Analyst sentiment is mixed, with some projecting modest rebounds based on low valuation levels and potential positive surprises in earnings results.







Do you think Apple will post better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q2? Let us know in the comments below.

Crypto Analyst Predicts 244% Shiba Inu Rally Based On Bull Flag


                            An analyst explained how Shiba Inu could be heading towards a massive rally based on a bull flag pattern that forms in its daily chart.
Shiba Inu Has Been Consolidating Inside A Bull Flag Recently
In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed about a bull flag that has recently appeared in the daily price of Shiba Inu. The bull flag is a pattern in technical analysis (TA) that, as its name suggests, is shaped like a flag on a pole.
The pattern forms when an uptrend is followed by a period of consolidation inside a parallel channel toward the downward direction. The starting uptrend makes up for the pole, while the channel acts as the flag.

Like other TA patterns, the consolidation channel or flag here comprises two parallel lines. The upper level connects the price tops, while the lower one joins the bottoms.
When the asset retests either of these levels, it’s probable to undergo a reversal, with the upper line of the channel acting as a point of resistance and the lower one as support.
A break above the resistance line is considered a bullish signal for the price. The uptrend resulting from such a break may be the same length as the flag’s pole.
On the other hand, a drop below the flag (that is, a breakdown of support) invalidates the formation and may even suggest the takeover of bearish momentum for the asset.
Similar to the bull flag, there is also the bear flag in TA, which works much in the same way, except that it occurs during a downtrend (with the flag signifying consolidation towards the upside following a downward pole).
Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that shows the bull flag pattern Shiba Inu has potentially been forming on its daily price recently:

The formation that the memecoin's price has been displaying during the last few weeks | Source: @ali_charts on X
From the graph, it’s clear that the Shiba Inu 1-day price has been consolidating inside what appears to be a bull flag pattern channel in the past few weeks.
“I’m placing buy orders around $0.000018343, aiming for a bullish breakout that sends $SHIB to $0.000072323,” says the analyst. The former level is about where SHIB should meet the flag’s support next if it continues in its current trajectory, while the latter target is based on the height of the pole.

A run to the bullish target of $0.000072323 would imply a rally of more than 244% from the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, while from the lower support of $0.000018343, any such surge would correspond to a growth of over 294%.
It remains to be seen whether Shiba Inu will show a break above this bull flag pattern and, if it does, whether the price will benefit from bullish effects.
SHIB Price
At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.00002110, down more than 18% over the past week.

Ripple vs. SEC: May 6 Reply Brief Could Seal Fate of XRP Institutional Sales


							

SEC’s reply brief in the Ripple opposition is due by Next Monday, May 6.



The reply brief concerns the $2 billion penalty the SEC proposed in March against Ripple.



Market pundits speculate that the SEC will likely persist in pursuing punitive disgorgement.




The XRP community anticipates that the U.S. SEC will submit a reply brief by May 6 in response to Ripple’s opposition to the regulator’s request for approximately $2 billion in penalties from Ripple.



For context, in the July 2023 victory judgment, the court also ruled that Ripple violated federal securities laws by selling XRP to institutions. Accordingly, the SEC has requested a civil penalty of $876.3 million, an additional $876.3 million in disgorgement, and prejudgment interest totaling $198.15 million, bringing the total proposed fines against Ripple to $1.95 billion. 



Furthermore, when the SEC filed its opening brief on March 22, advocating for an almost $2 billion penalty, it also accused Ripple of persisting in XRP sales to institutional investors post-complaint. As a result, the SEC urged the court to prohibit XRP sales to institutional investors.



However, in its opposition brief last week, Ripple presented compelling legal arguments opposing the SEC’s claims. Ripple contended that the XRP sales conducted after the complaint were to accredited investors and were facilitated through ODL transactions. These sales are exempt from U.S. securities laws, as they were carried out by Ripple’s Singapore branch, which is regulated by Singapore’s central bank. 









Additionally, Ripple’s president, Monica Long, testified that even these ODL transactions resumed after the July 2023 judgment because Ripple had ceased XRP sales since the SEC filed the charges.



Now, the SEC is expected to file its comment on Ripple’s opposition by Monday, May 6. Market pundits speculate that the SEC will likely persist in its pursuit of punitive disgorgement and injunction, restricting Ripple from engaging in further XRP institutional sales. Besides, on Monday, April 29, the SEC filed its opposition to Ripple’s motion to strike the SEC’s new expert materials. These filings are projected to be the final submission before Judge Analisa Torres decides on the penalty for selling XRP to institutional investors.

The Fidelity report on Bitcoin volatility

According to the recent report by Fidelity, Bitcoin is showing a reduction in volatility as it progresses as a mature digital asset. 
Fidelity has noticed that cryptocurrency volatility has dropped to historic lows on an annual basis. Furthermore, it has stated that in the last two years Bitcoin has been less volatile than Netflix.
Let’s see below all the details. 

Fidelity: Bitcoin volatility will continue to decrease
As anticipated, Bitcoin (BTC) has long been considered an extremely volatile asset, but its volatility is decreasing. 
This trend is expected to continue as the cryptocurrency evolves, according to a report published on Wednesday by Fidelity Digital Assets.
The analyst Zack Wainwright explained that new assets tend to go through a period of price discovery and stabilization. Even gold, after the United States abandoned the gold standard in the 1970s, showed high volatility.
Over the course of fifteen years, Bitcoin has already begun to show signs of maturity, with volatility at its historical lows on an annual basis. Wainwright commented: 
“We see a clear trend towards a reduction in volatility for Bitcoin over time and we predict that it will continue as the cryptocurrency further stabilizes.”
According to Fidelity, Bitcoin is currently less volatile than 33 of the companies in the S&P 500, and has been less volatile than 92 of these companies up until October 2023, when using 90-day realized volatility data. 
Bitcoin: less volatile than Netflix, but still sensitive to capital movements
In the last two years, Bitcoin has shown less volatility compared to Netflix (NFLX) and, when compared to the so-called “magnificent seven”, a group of high-performing stocks, the volatility of Bitcoin does not appear anomalous.
However, Fidelity has emphasized that, as is the case for all emerging asset classes with a small market capitalization, Bitcoin could continue to experience episodes of high volatility due to new capital inflows. 
The forecast is that, with the maturation of the cryptocurrency and the increase in its market capitalization, these effects will be mitigated, as new capital will be distributed on a broader basis.
The expected approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States in January and the resulting inflows could further reduce the volatility of the cryptocurrency. 
However, Bitcoin has experienced a decrease of over 16% in the last month. The report noted that, as Bitcoin consolidates, new capital inflows will also have a smaller impact on price movements.
Fidelity and other Bitcoin ETFs record significant outflows
Fidelity’s Bitcoin spot ETF recently recorded net outflows of $22.61 million, marking the first day with net withdrawals since the fund was launched in January. 
Other US cryptocurrency funds have reported daily outflows totaling $217.58 million.
Specifically, Grayscale saw $139.37 million leave its converted ETF, while Ark Invest and 21Shares recorded withdrawals of $31.34 million. 
Valkyrie had an overall outflow of 20.16 million dollars and Bitwise lost 6 million dollars. The only fund that saw net inflows, with 1.87 million dollars, was Franklin Templeton’s EZBC. 
The 71-day positive flow of BlackRock’s IBIT fund was interrupted on Thursday, although, according to James Seyffart of Bloomberg, zero flows are a common situation.
The research by Hong Song-uk, analyst at NH Investment and Securities, found that fund inflows into Bitcoin were almost non-existent after the cryptocurrency’s halving. 
Investors in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) have maintained a rather negative view for a long period. According to Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg, the 72-day period of constant outflows is the longest in the history of global ETF funds. 
Uncertainty and high fees could be the reasons behind GBTC’s difficulties compared to its competitors.

                        Nibiru Chain, a $100 million HashKey and Kraken Ventures-backed Layer 1 blockchain, has announced two senior hires from Yuga Labs and Starknet Asia as part of its Asia expansion.The project has appointed Yura Nam, an ex-head of StarkNet Asia, and Nicholas Lo, a former APAC Growth Manager at Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) developer Yuga Labs, as Asia Growth and Asia Business Development leads, respectively.Expanding Across Asia
The US-based Nibiru’s expansion goal is to cultivate local brand presence and adoption in each Asia region, said a press release sahred with Cryptonews.Therefore, the team will focus on driving forward adoption, forging strategic partnerships, public relations, marketing engagements, offline events, community management, business development, and developer relations.The targeted regions include Korea, Japan, India, Southeast Asia (SEA), and Chinese-speaking countries.Furthermore, Nibiru will be hiring local community leads in each country.The Asia team will continue to expand with ongoing role searches for Community Growth in countries such as India, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines, it said.The team already has relationships with “some of the major players in the region,” including builders, validators, and media companies.It is pursuing partnerships and collaborations and is exploring opportunities to engage with the developer community through grants, hackathons, accelerators, VC funds, and other initiatives.Navigating the Complexities of Local Markets
The Nibiru Chain team suggested that the two latest hires are a key part of the project’s expansion plans.As Asia Business Development, Lo will lead efforts to establish Nibiru’s presence in key APAC markets.Lo previously worked as an analyst at JPMorgan and held the position of business development manager at Hong Kong FinTech Week, D3 Bahamas, and Finoverse.Furthermore, he previously led Asia expansion at “numerous exchanges,” the announcement said.At Nibiru, he will work at building relationships with major protocols, ecosystem dapps, conglomerates, gaming companies, financial institutions, and local partners.Lo will also work closely with Asian media companies to create exposure for the project’s L1 offering, targeting verticals in gaming, DeFi, NFTs, and RWAs, it said.Meanwhile, Nam has seven years of experience in the financial services industry.Her previous positions also involved working on partnerships, sponsorships, agreements, and event planning and facilitation.She has significant experience hosting conferences, meetups, and tours, among other events, and is an active member of the Korean blockchain community Nonce.Lo and Nam will utilize their experience, industry connections, and regional cultural insights to “navigate the complexities of the Asia market,” the announcement said.COO Jonathan Chang remarked that the new hires will support Nibiru in “incorporating best practices for go-to-market, leveraging their track record of relationship building and execution.”“Going forward, they will helm a multitude of Nibiru’s events, partnerships, and growth initiatives in the region.”Nibiru Chain Has A $100 Million Valuation
Nibiru came out of stealth at the end of 2022. It reported that “dozens of projects” have begun building on the chain since then across sectors like RWAs, gaming, and DeFi.In April 2023, it raised $8.5 million in seed funding at a $100 million valuation.The round was led by Tribe Capital, Republic Capital, NGC Ventures, and Original Capital.It saw participation from Acacia Digital, Alves Ventures, Basis Set Ventures, BECO Capital, Broadhaven, CapitalX, Cerulean Ventures, Cogitent Ventures, Cosmostation, HashKey Capital, Helikon Investments, Imperatore Travel World, Lecca Group, Meteorcap Ventures, SaxeCap, The Picks & Shovels Co., Token Metrics, VC3 DAO, and others.

New Major Milestone for Shiba Inu (SHIB): Details


																TL;DR

Shibarium, the layer-2 blockchain solution for Shiba Inu, continues to grow robustly, surpassing significant milestones in blocks, transactions, and wallet addresses despite SHIB’s price struggles.
Recent developments in the network include a user interface update for better wallet compatibility and an upcoming hard fork to enhance user experience and transaction efficiency.


Shibarium’s Latest Achievement
Contrary to the unsatisfactory price condition of Shiba Inu in the past few weeks, the asset’s layer-2 blockchain solution – Shibarium – keeps making waves. 
Latest data shows that the number of total blocks on the network surpassed the milestone of 4.5 million. Total transactions currently stand at around 417 million, whereas wallet addresses are inching towards 1.8 million.
Shibarium’s progress looks quite impressive considering the fact that it officially saw the light of day at the end of last summer. The feature’s main goal is to foster the development of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem by improving speed, lowering transaction fees, and enhancing scalability.




Those curious to learn more about the network can take a thorough look at our dedicated video below:

The Two Important Upgrades
As CryptoPotato reported last week, Shibarium’s team launched a new user interface (UI) update, describing it as “faster, smoother, and more accessible than ever.” It aims to enhance compatibility with popular self-custody wallets including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. 
In addition, the developers revealed that Shibarium will undergo another upgrade this week through a “hard fork.” The advancement’s ultimate goal is to improve user experience, empower the community of developers and innovators, and implement quicker block processing times.
“We are also smoothing out transaction fee variations during high traffic times, making costs more predictable and fair for everyone. This ensures our platform remains affordable and accessible,” the team added.

Scoop: Justin Sun falsely claimed diplomatic immunity in lawsuit


According to sources familiar with the Richard Hall and Lukasz Juraszek vs Rainberry Inc. lawsuit, Justin Sun was not entitled to use diplomatic immunity to avoid liability concerning his actions while running the BitTorrent buyer.
This is despite long-term claims from the Tron founder’s legal team that his ambassadorial roles handed him this loophole.
A Web3 of lies
In 2021, Grenada announced that Sun had been appointed the Ambassador, Permanent Representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization. This is true, as evidenced by a 2024 Grenadian news article that states Sun was terminated from his UN position, along with a slew of other foreigners who had cushy diplomatic roles, in 2022.
Protos has also obtained documentation confirming Sun’s status as a diplomat for Grenada and a visa proving that he was Ambassador for Science and Emerging Technology for Grenada’s Mission to the United Nations.
However, as detailed by the Associate Spokesperson for the Secretary-General Executive Office of the Secretary-General, Shirin Yaseen, this ambassadorship only grants diplomatic immunity in Switzerland when a representative is on a mission.



Sun was indeed an ambassador… But this meant precisely zero when it came to his court case.
Read more: Justin Sun insists he never meant to sell Tron and BitTorrent to US investors
“Issues of immunity regarding diplomats/representatives is a bilateral issue between the country in question and the US,” said Yaseen. “Immunity comes into effect only when we are carrying out our official functions.”
She added, “There’s no retroactive immunity.” This suggests that, regardless of whether or not Sun briefly obtained the immunity status, it shouldn’t have, and wouldn’t have, affected the outcome of the civil court case.
The source says that Sun first claimed diplomatic immunity in March of 2022, which is only a few months before the crypto billionaire lost his Grenadian WTO and UN ambassadorships altogether. As such, it’s odd that his legal team continued to suggest that Sun had any diplomatic immunity whatsoever through May 2023.
Sun’s plans fail
It’s clear that Sun attempted, through investing in Grenada, to create a diplomatic bubble in which he was untouchable — civilly and criminally. 
But the horse Sun hitched his wagon to bolted quickly when Grenada’s ruling party lost an election and he was stripped of his titles. Additionally, the titles and immunities Sun was able to acquire were so narrow in scope that there is no possibility that they would have functioned in the way Sun hoped.
Ultimately, the arbitrator in the civil case against Sun stated that:
“It is evident that Sun’s refusal to appear at deposition, in violation of the Arbitrator’s order are willful – they are knowing and intentional. Sun’s refusal to appear involves a violation fundamental to the case; despite his prior conduct acknowledging that his deposition was appropriate he refuses to be deposed at all.“

Endgame
Sun and Rainberry have settled the civil suit brought against them by Richard Hall and Lukasz Juraszek; diplomatic immunity didn’t pay off.
The arbitrator in the civil suit struck Sun’s testimony from the record and ordered a default against him. It’s unknown exactly what settlement was reached.
Sun doesn’t take trips to Switzerland or visit San Francisco anymore — his days of appearing at the World Trade Organization and making excuses for missing lunches with Warren Buffett are behind him. Instead, the billionaire spends the majority of his time hopping between countries where he’s least likely to be extradited to the US, and marketing TRON and his cryptocurrency exchanges.

Binance ties SAFU fund to USDC: Is the fund missing out on potential gains?

The Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU ) — an emergency fund established by crypto exchange Binance to cover user assets — contained various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), True USD (TUSD) and BNB (BNB).But on April 18, 2024, Binance denominated the entire fund — 100% of SAFU assets — in Circle’s USD Coin (USDC).The timing of this decision may seem odd, with the Bitcoin bull market in full swing, driven by the recent halving and high Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) volumes. In the conversion, Binance exchanged 1.36 million BNB, 16,277 BTC and its holdings from USDT and TUSD to USDC. With 100% of SAFU now essentially pegged to the U.S. dollar through a government-regulated stablecoin, what does this mean for Binance? SAFU funds will lose value in exchange for securityIn July 2018, Binance launched the SAFU and financed it by committing a small percentage of trading fees. On Jan. 29, 2022, the SAFU funds had reached $1 billion. The fund’s dollar value has fluctuated amid crypto market conditions, waning during the bear market and reappearing above the $1 billion mark again in April 2024. While denominating the fund in stablecoins will make it less susceptible to market swings, it also means that it will miss out on potential gains and be exposed to U.S. dollar inflation, as some market observers have noted. Billionaire investor and Draper Associates founder Tim Draper told Cointelegraph that he thinks Binance’s decision to modify the fund is “short-sighted.” He believes allocating 100% of a portfolio to a stablecoin pegged to the dollar is unwise, adding that he “doesn’t see government spending decreasing.” Recent: Bitcoin L2s set to explode as Runes congest BTC network“Governments have little incentive to decrease spending when they are able to print money that people accept,” he said.Bitcoin is widely considered a safe haven asset, similar to gold. Inflation, money printing and geopolitical instability are considered ideal conditions for BTC. According to Draper, the SAFU will decline as Bitcoin rises:“The dollar continues to decline against Bitcoin, and I believe that decline will continue and accelerate over time.”For others, missing out on potential gains may just be the price Binance has to pay for a secure fund.Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at fintech and crypto exchange YouHodler, agrees with Draper that “in such a configuration, SAFU funds will lose value due to inflation, but we can consider it as a payment for safety.” Lienkha told Cointelegraph that Binance could benefit from USDC’s fully centralized stablecoin setup, as it would be “less exposed to hacker attacks, stolen USDCs are much easier to find and block than decentralized Bitcoin.”He said that the SAFU “doesn’t have any specific investment goals, as it is a kind of insurance in case of emergency.” It could be possible that Binance prioritizes security over long-term valuation, but is Binance deciding freely or following orders? Binance may have its hands tied Binance may not have made the sudden exchange of SAFU funds to USDC voluntarily.Binance declined to answer Cointelegraph’s question about the precise motivations behind its decision. However, Binance’s recent history with U.S. regulatory authorities may be an important factor in adopting USDC for the SAFU.Grant Gulovsen, a U.S. lawyer who works with crypto clients, told Cointelegraph, “Binance had agreed to monitoring by the U.S. Treasury as part of their settlement late last year, so this certainly could be related to that.”In 2023, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance for violating trading and derivatives rules. Related: Here’s why CFTC suing Binance is a bigger deal than an SEC enforcementThe results forced Binance founder Changpeng Zhao to step down and settle a fine of $4.3 billion with U.S. authorities.Another consequence of the case was an agreement with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to extensively monitor Binance operations.Binance’s plea deal with the U.S. government also included five years of oversight by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), as detailed in an X post by former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission official John Reed Stark:Source: John Reed StarkThe change to USDC may be part of this new compliance agreement Binance has with U.S. authorities. Why did Binance pick USDC? The stablecoin is widely branded within the crypto community as the market’s most regulated and compliant stablecoin. According to the compliance professional and board member of Crypto Valley Association, Ekaterina Anthony: “U.S. law enforcement have the same amount of power on both Tether, Circle and Paxos. They can ask any of them to stop serving certain entities if they desire to.” However, she told Cointelegraph that “it might be a bit more difficult to go after non-U.S. residents than to go after U.S. residents — that means that the directors of Circle might be easier ‘to grab.’”Binance’s USDC move highlights importance of complianceThe crypto market has matured rapidly from being considered a Wild West market to being acknowledged by institutional investors, exemplified by the approval of U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. Indeed, many crypto market observers anticipate a massive injection of capital from institutional investors in the near future as they become more comfortable with digital assets. But, institutional investors require more secure and regulated markets.This has created competition among stablecoin issuers to create products that are compliant with emerging regulatory frameworks. USDT has dominated the stablecoin sector, mainly because it established itself as a first mover. However, Tether has been shrouded by fear, uncertainty and doubt due to its opaque approach regarding the assets backing USDT.Recent: Changpeng Zhao four-month prison sentence lighter than expectedIn contrast, USDC has branded itself as a highly regulated and compliant stablecoin since its launch in 2018. This has allowed USDC to take the lead in institutional adoption over Tether. Circle has also applied as an authorized stablecoin issuer under the new European legal framework, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation.Binance has previously shifted the balance of SAFU funds to more regulated assets. In March 2023, it replaced the Binance (BUSD) in the fund with True USD (TUSD), reportedly in response to U.S. enforcement action against the former’s issuer, Paxos.Binance’s move to adopt USDC may be highly induced by the oversight of the U.S. authorities. However, the exchange may be making a safe move, following the crypto industry’s trend of exhibiting regulatory compliance to attract the new wave of institutional investors.

Lightning fast Layer 1 token Sei is crashing today. 
                        Ethereum and Solana competitor Sei’s price has shed 11% in the last week, taking some of the heaviest losses in a brutal market-wide sell-off that sank the price of market leader Bitcoin by about 8% in the same period.Sei currently changes hands at $0.5385. This represents a slight gain of over 1% in the last 24 hours but a 24% decline from its price this time last month. Sei is an EVM-integrated blockchain Layer 1, merging Ethereum’s market-leading development framework with the speed and transaction cost scalability of high-performing rivals like Solana. Investors’ risk-averse sentiment this week appears to be spurred by news that the US Federal Reserve plans to keep interest rates higher for longer to help stem rampant inflation.Bitcoin retreated 9% in two days, from a high of $64,515 on Tuesday to its current price of $58,595. At the height of the crash, yesterday afternoon, the world’s number one cryptocurrency bottomed out at $56,804.Virtually all other leading Layer 1 blockchain tokens retained value better than Sei this week. Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA), and Ethereum (ETH) dropped in tandem, only shedding a little over 3% this week.Sei’s trading chart over the last three months reveals a token that closely tracked Bitcoin. The market-wide rally that began at the end of February and peaked in early March helped Sei set a new all-time high (ATH) of $1.14 on March 16. However, it has since pulled back about 53%. Source: TradingViewThe Sei price and valuaiton is currently recovering and is in line with the rest of the market. Its Relative Strength Index is 59 and climbing, indicating increasing buying momentum. It has also appreciated almost 2% in the last hour, so Sei holders are likely out of the woods now.As SEI Price Tumbles, Mega Dice Hits Jackpot!
Scaleability and interoperability are the two hottest buzzwords in crypto right now because they represent the path to greater adoption.Both Bitcoin and Ethereum lag behind speedier and cheaper rivals, although in terms of interoperability, Ethereum’s Virtual Machine (EVM) has helped the network’s developer community set smart contract and software standards across the whole industry.Still, since Layer 1 tokens often rise in sync, investing in them can feel predictable. Crypto and Web3 have a plethora of services to offer beyond more optimized tech.GambleFi is one sector that’s getting more of a look-in nowadays. The term refers to any crypto-native online gambling platform or product.According to data by Statista, online gambling is projected to take in $100.90 billion in revenue this year. This means there has never been a better time for crypto to show the world its iGaming utility. Enter Mega Dice’s brand new $DICE token.The $DICE presale is only a fortnight old, and it has already bagged almost $700,000 in investments, according to the token’s website.Mega Dice launched last year as the world’s first licensed crypto casino accessible through the popular messaging app Telegram.Since then, 50,000 players have signed up and helped the casino become a well-established name in GambleFi. As the platform’s native token, players can use $DICE to fund games and receive winnings. Casino customers who play with $DICE will have further benefits down the line. The casino plans to integrate the token into its loyalty program, offering more generous rewards to gamers who opt to play with it. The token will also unlock access to exclusive competitions and VIP experiences.The team has also indicated there will be a buyback and burn program.

Former PayPal President says Bitcoin ‘will be the native currency of AI’


As cryptocurrencies proliferate and become more popular in the mainstream, particularly the most famous crypto asset and the sector’s representative, Bitcoin (BTC), could evolve to become the native currency of artificial intelligence (AI), as per the former President of PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL).
Indeed, David Marcus, the ex-PayPal President and current CEO of Lightspark, the platform enabling open payments over the Lightning Network, has shared his vision of Bitcoin for the future during a speech at MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations 2024 on May 1.
Bitcoin as neutral friction remover
Notably, he highlighted the need to remove the “friction of converting non-digital money into digital money” in payments, so an accepted method would have to be “digitally native” and “maximally neutral,” specifying that the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset fits the bill.



“The Europeans are not going to accept an American version of a digital asset or vice-versa. And what is the most neutral form of digitally native, internet money? It’s Bitcoin. So, if you make it super-efficient, super-fast, real-time, at the speed of AI transactions, that’s basically going to be the native currency of AI.”

Internet-native medium for value transfer
Furthermore, Marcus observed the development of AI by Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Translate service, as this “thing you can talk to and it speaks another language (…) using unassisted, unaided learning, [and which] came up with its own neutral language to basically translate one language to another using its own thing.”
In this context, the former PayPal President pointed out that Bitcoin could, similarly, act as a neutral medium for transfer of value over the internet, in much the same way as Google Translate’s AI is using its own native made-up tongue to transfer meaning between languages:

“So what is it going to be for value between AI agents? Definitely Bitcoin. Because that’s the neutral language of value on the internet.”

Meanwhile, the largest asset in the crypto market was at press time trading at the price of $58,714, which indicates a 1.89% gain in the last 24 hours, while it tries to reverse the loss of 7.56% across the previous seven days, and the 9.88% decline over the past month, as per data on May 2.

RippleX developers have unveiled a game-changing proposal that intends to introduce a native lending protocol, codenamed XLS-66d. The new proposal lays the groundwork for deploying a groundbreaking lending protocol directly on XRP Ledger, which is intended to revolutionize how lending takes place on the blockchain.  The proposal establishes mechanisms for fixed-term, interest-accruing loans pooled from collective funds that do not require on-chain collateral. This strategy secures the protocol using off-chain underwriting and risk management, as well as a First-Loss Capital protection plan.At its core, the protocol will allow for easy lending, with terms agreed upon directly by the borrower and the lending pool's delegated manager. Unlike traditional lending protocols in DeFi, which are smart contracts that run on a virtual machine, the XRPL's Lending Protocol will be integrated directly into the ledger's consensus layer and protocol.The lending protocol would allow liquidity providers to contribute XRP or other fungible tokens into a lending pool managed by a pool delegate, earning interest.With an eye toward future development, the protocol will be designed to be both upgradeable and adaptable, allowing for a wide range of prospective enhancements while maintaining backward compatibility. The lending portion of the specification is intended to be implemented on top of another specification, resulting in a single asset vault on XRP Ledger. This is intended to open up other use cases beyond loans in the future, like yield farming, escrow and more. By using general ledger entries rather than single-use ones, the protocol ensures that components such as pseudo-accounts and tokenized pools can be used in a variety of future applications.

2 Months of Stagnant Bitcoin Price Action: Report


Despite the excitement surrounding the recent halving in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin may be entering a period of price stabilization that could last up to two months, according to market analysts at Bitfinex. 
The report suggests that Bitcoin will continue to set the pace for the cryptocurrency market through May and remain a critical indicator of the sector’s overall market cap.
Bitcoin Price Action Will Slowdown
Bitfinex analysts emphasize that consumers and businesses are now more informed about the economic foundations influencing market trends, unlike previous cycles. 
This knowledge could lead to a one to two-month consolidation phase for Bitcoin. As a result, prices could fluctuate, potentially reaching up to $10,000 in either direction. 
The anticipated stagnation follows Bitcoin’s peak market dominance, which seems to wane as liquidity shifts towards altcoins. This shift is attributed to the halving reduction of the new BTC supply. It historically boosts investor risk appetite and diverts attention toward altcoins.

“The 57 percent level in BTC.D represents a significant technical and psychological benchmark based on historical data. Once Bitcoin dominance reaches this level, it tends to experience a sharp rejection indicating a shift in market sentiment and capital flow from Bitcoin to altcoins. Following last week’s halving, we saw BTC.D reach 57 percent and then fall sharply through it,” Bitfinex analysts wrote.

Moreover, market specialists are watching Bitcoin derivatives closely. The reduced implied volatility seen recently suggests a quieter summer ahead for Bitcoin. 

“Summers are usually low volatility periods, and traders are starting to position accordingly based on their bias,” Jag Kooner, Bitfinex Head of Derivatives, said.

As the market adjusts to the halving and economic signals, investors are advised to monitor these developments closely. They must keep an eye on shifts in liquidity and market sentiment that could dictate the pace for the remainder of the year.

LayerZero Labs Sets Stage for Airdrop With Snapshot - The Defiant

LayerZero's transfer volume surpassed $6.7 billion in the first quarter of 2024.LayerZero Labs, a cross-chain interoperability protocol, has completed the first snapshot ahead of its much-anticipated airdrop.The snapshot was taken at 11:59:59 PM UTC on May 1, 2024, according to an announcement on X. LayerZero did not share what criteria will determine eligibility for its upcoming airdrop, or any specific details about the airdrop.However, the project did state note this was snapshot "#1," hinting that additional snapshots to determine eligibility may be taken in the future. “More information coming soon,” the LayerZero teased.Airdrop hunters have long speculated that LayerZero may drop a token to users in the future.Airdrops serve as a means for web3 projects to distribute governance tokens to early users. This incentivizes adoption, with many users hoping to score free tokens flocking to early-stage projects. Recipients must meet specific criteria set by the project to be eligible for the airdrop.Following Aribtrum’s high-profile airdrop in March 2023, LayerZero’s cumulative transaction volume tripled over the course of a single month, with nearly 5 million transactions executed via LayerZero in roughly 30 days.In December 2023, LayerZero finally put the rampant speculation to bed by confirming that distributing a token to users was included as part of its roadmap.“We’ll state now in no uncertain terms that there will be a LayerZero token,” LayerZero Labs tweeted on Dec. 8, 2023. “Its distribution is something we’re committed to getting right and expect it to happen within the first half of 2024.”LayerZero adoption surgesIn the first quarter of 2024, LayerZero protocol hosted more than $6.7 billion worth of cross-chain asset transfers, marking a 91% increase from the quarter before, data from Messari shows.Message traffic surged, with 29.6 million messages sent via LayerZero for a 60% quarterly increase. This period also saw a 93% rise in smart contract deployments on LayerZero, indicating growing developer adoption of the protocol.In April 2023, LayerZero raised $120 million in a Series B funding round at a valuation of $3 billion.

Bitcoin Trader Insists The Bull Market is Not Over Despite Recent Pullbacks


							

Bitcoin trader known as “Titan of Crypto” has stated that the bull market is not over.



The trader used data from the BTC/USD daily chart to show there is still momentum in the Bitcoin uptrend.



Bitcoin broke below significant support early this week, dropping below the critical $60,000 level.




A famous Bitcoin trader identified as Titan of Crypto on X has stated that the bull market is not over. In a recent post, the renowned trader used data from the BTC/USD daily chart to show there is still some momentum in the Bitcoin uptrend amid several calls for the beginning of a bear market from some crypto users.







Titan of Crypto’s post comprised a screenshot of the BTC/USD daily chart with a pair of moving average indicators superimposed on the chart. He identified the indicators as MA111 and MA350*2. 



In his analysis, the trader spotted a couple of significant areas on the chart where BTC reacted uniquely to the indicators. In the later stages of the price action, Titan of Crypto highlighted a “Real Breakout” and two “Retest Points.” In between the “Retest Points,” he noted another point where the indicator signaled a price “Rejection.”



The trader combined the price action across those points to conclude there is still substantial momentum in Bitcoin’s upside movement despite the recent pullback. He believes the bullish momentum would remain until the MA111 line crosses above the MA350*2.



Bitcoin broke below significant support early this week, dropping below the critical $60,000 level. The drop followed a prolonged sideways movement after the flagship crypto reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,794 in the middle of March. 









The latest drop marks the most significant one-sided movement since the latest Bitcoin halving on April 19. The nature of the drop injected some Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) into the Bitcoin market, with many users suspecting a fresh bear market is emerging. 



Titan of Crypto thinks otherwise and believes the pullback is a temporary price movement. The pioneer cryptocurrency traded for $57,849 at the time of writing, marking a 23.5% drop from the ATH, according to data from TradingView.

Tether nets US$4.52 bln Q1 profit from investments


Tether, the company behind the widely-used stablecoin USDT, has reported a record US$4.52 billion net profit for the first quarter of 2024, a 61% increase from the previous quarter.



The substantial earnings were primarily driven by the company’s investments in US Treasury bonds and the appreciation of its Bitcoin and gold reserves, according to the firm’s Q1 attestation.



As of March 31, 2024, Tether’s net equity has surged to US$11.37 billion.



The company’s strategic allocation of over US$90 billion in US Treasury bonds has been a significant contributor to the profit leap. 

	
	
	
	


The financial performance of Tether hints at a possible strong backing for USDT, which maintains a 1:1 value with the U.S. dollar and has a market capitalization of approximately US$110 billion, according to CoinGecko.



The company said it issued 12 billion new USDT tokens in the first quarter.



The company’s Bitcoin holdings have doubled in value, reaching US$5.4 billion, and its gold reserves have increased to US$3.7 billion. 



Tether has not completed a formal audit. Instead, it provides quarterly attestation that reports US$6.3 billion in excess reserves and US$4.7 billion in secured loans.

	
	
	

	


Tether’s financial infrastructure extends beyond stablecoins, with ventures in data, technology, and the mining and energy sectors.

Crypto Bear Sentiment Grips Investors as Fear Spikes - DailyCoin


        
Bitcoin lost key support levels on Wednesday.



Bear sentiment has flooded crypto markets.



The Fear and Greed Index drops sharply into fear territory.
This week, a wave of bad news has engulfed markets, stirring bearish crypto sentiment. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison for money laundering violations, while Bitcoin Cash proponent Roger Ver faced accusations of tax evasion. These legal troubles have clouded the sector, shaking investor confidence.Adding fuel to the fire, Wednesday saw the market react negatively to the Fed’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged as it strives to meet its 2% inflation target. Bitcoin tumbled below the key $59,300 support zone in response to the news, dragging the rest of the market lower and stoking fear of further downside price action to come.Crypto Bear Sentiment Takes HoldThe Bitcoin sell-off sunk the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to 43 on Thursday, marking a 31-week low, while moving into the fear zone for the first time since late January. This metric, which gauges the overall market sentiment, has been trending downward since March 5, when it stood at a lofty 90, firmly within the extreme greed zone.Fear and Greed Index per AlternativeAlthough sentiment was still comfortably in the greed zone at 67 by the end of April, this week’s legal troubles have tanked market sentiment to its current 43 reading, indicating a degree of investor anxiety over recent price action.
Bitcoin opened this week at $63,000 and saw moderate gains on Monday, closing the day at $63,800. However, Tuesday witnessed an 8% swing to the downside, with BTC closing at $60,500. The sell-off intensified on Wednesday, as Bitcoin lost the crucial $59,300 support zone, recording an intraday low of $56,600, marking a 9-week low for the largest cryptocurrency.BTCUSD daily chart on Trading ViewAlthough Bitcoin breached the $59,300 support zone to fuel fears of a deeper downturn, several prominent analysts argued that such pullbacks are expected even in bull markets.  Macro Uptrend Remains IntactCrypto bear turbulence this week has stirred talk of the end of the bull market. However, several prominent analysts maintain that the price action witnessed is natural within bull cycles.
Analyst Rekt Capital drew parallels with past post-halving periods, stating that a similar pullback to what we are currently experiencing was last seen in 2016, inferring that the current negative price action is to be expected.  X influencer DonAlt stated, despite the heavy drawdown, “BTC holders don’t really have much reason to panic.” Trader CrediBULL Crypto echoed DonAlt’s sentiment by reminding his followers to zoom out, adding, “We could go down another 20% from current levels (not saying I think we will) and it wouldn’t change anything on the higher timeframes.”On the Flipside
Macro and geopolitical factors remain headwinds to a crypto market recovery.



The 24-hour Bitcoin long-short ratio for May 2 is 0.972, an increase from 0.955 on Wednesday, indicating improving sentiment among long traders.

Ripple Unlocks 1 Billion XRP From Escrow - How Will This Impact Price?


                            On-chain data recently showed that Ripple carried out its monthly escrow unlock for May. As expected, this has raised concerns about how it could affect the XRP price, especially since Ripple has been accused of manipulating the token’s price. 
Ripple Unlocks 500 Million XRP Tokens
Onchain data revealed 500 million XRP tokens were unlocked from Ripple’s escrow on May 1. The crypto firm is known to unlock 1 billion tokens monthly, although it looks to have only unlocked half this time around. The magnitude of these tokens always raises concerns, considering the negative impact they could have on the altcoin’s price if dumped on the market. 
Further analysis of the on-chain data shows that Ripple sent 300 million XRP out of the unlocked tokens to an escrowed account (2Not4co2op). Meanwhile, the crypto firm sent the remaining 200 million XRP tokens to another wallet (4vt5x1o91m). Considering that the 200 million XRP tokens weren’t sent to escrow, Ripple may have plans to sell them at some point, although it has yet to do so. 
It is also worth mentioning that Ripple received another 500 million XRP tokens from an unknown wallet (ymFZmKxEsF). However, these funds were immediately sent to an escrow account. As such, the community can heave a sigh of relief since most of the XRP tokens Ripple received in the last 24 hours have been sent back to escrow. 
Talks About Ripple Dumping On The Market Resurface
Following the latest token unlock, the crypto community has reignited talks about Ripple’s alleged dumping on XRP holders. The question of whether or not Ripple’s XRP sales influence the token’s price has been a long-standing discussion, with notable figures like pro-XRP crypto YouTuber Jerry Hall even accusing Ripple of intentionally suppressing the altcoin’s price with its sales. 
On the other hand, people like Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) have clarified that the crypto firm’s XRP sales do not impact the crypto token’s price. Moreover, Ripple already discontinued programmatic sales, which means that its transactions cannot affect prices on crypto exchanges. 
Ripple also noted in its recent court filing in its ongoing legal battle against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had taken measures to ensure its institutional sales did not violate securities laws. This suggests that Ripple conducts its sales over the counter (OTC) to avoid further scrutiny from the Commission. 
At the time of writing, the token is trading at around $0.5, up over 2% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin price correction 'very common' if $56K lows hold - Peter Brandt

AI predicts Gold price for May 31, 2024


Gold has found its spot in many headlines in recent weeks thanks to its near-continuous surging to record highs – including rising to finish April at its highest-ever end-of-month price at about $2,300 per ounce. 
Indeed, with the stock market and economic outlook feeling uncertain and geopolitical fears mounting, the king of safe-haven commodities has indeed been climbing rapidly, with many experts – including Bloomberg’s Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone – predicting the precious metal is likely to hit $3,000.
Many, again including McGlone, have also concluded that, with the recent disheartening inflation data and a widespread belief that a recession has been postponed rather than avoided, gold has a substantial advantage over stocks and cryptocurrencies and that it will outperform many other assets in the long run.


Short-term predictions, on the other hand, are in a shorter supply and with gold trading with significant volatility in the last few days, Finbold decided to consult artificial intelligence (AI) of OpenAI’s flagship platform – ChatGPT – on where gold might find itself at the end of May.
AI forecasts gold price at the end of May
As analysts and experts are themselves highly bullish about gold’s likely performance by the end of 2024, the AI is also positive about the precious metal’s prospects.
Still, its most likely scenario would see gold remain in its press time range, either slightly below or slightly above its press-time price of $2,292. ChatGPT also offered a substantially more bullish forecast that would – at $2,450 – send gold well on its way toward the year-end forecasted value of $3,000.
Finally, the AI also sees a slight possibility that gold’s current slump could deepen and could, in one month’s time, find itself at $2,150.
Gold price forecast for May 31, 2024. Source: ChatGPT & Finbold
While a rally toward $2,450 in one month’s time might appear ambitious, a substantial increase should not be entirely ruled out.
Indeed, gold has been both rising and trading with some volatility recently and though there have been few news as concerning as the possibility of a full-blown war between Israel and Iran that ran high in mid-April, the situation in the Middle East remains tense, and the situation in Europe is growing tenser with President Macron’s increasingly hawkish rhetoric.

After a gold slump in the second half of April, Nicky Shiels, Head of Metals Strategy at MKS PAMP, opined that ‘no new bad news is bad news for Gold (& Silver) bulls,’ and with the potential dangers looming ahead, the precious metal may indeed see a massive surge in the coming weeks.

Ethereum tops daily NFT sales at US$7 mln, ends weakest month of 2024


Ethereum closed Wednesday’s non-fungible token (NFT) sales as the top blockchain in the market, with US$6.87 million, CrptoSlam data shows.



The platform witnessed a slight decrease in total transactions to 14,840, compared to 14,987 the previous day, yet it maintained a high level of activity with 4,229 unique buyers and 3,304 unique sellers.



Ethereum closed its worst monthly NFT performance since October 2023.



In April, Ethereum recorded US$241 million in sales, which is more than half of the US$489 million it had in March, according to CryptoSlam data.

	
	
	
	


Bitcoin was Wednesday’s second-ranked position for NFT sales. Its gap from Ethereum wasn’t large, however, as Bitcoin recorded US$6.74 million in daily sales.



Bitcoin had a better month than Ethereum in April with more than US$602 million in sales to lead the market, but down from US$625 million in March.



Bitcoin collection sales were boosted by its halving event on April 20, which coincided with the launch of Runes, a new fungible token protocol for the world’s first blockchain network.



Solana came in third on Wednesday with US$2.54 million.

	
	
	

	


Solana also failed to improve from its March performance of US$249 million, dropping to US$153.5 million in monthly sales. 



Overall, NFT sales volume in April dropped to US$1.15 billion from US$1.53 billion in March. April had the lowest NFT sales in 2024 so far but still managed to record an increase of around 56% year-over-year.

Cocoa prices have fallen nearly a third from their record highs

A pile of cocoa podsPhoto: Chris Jackson (Getty Images)After starting the year on a tear that put the fear of God in Easter baskets everywhere, cocoa prices are backing sharply off record highs. Futures for the commodity have dropped nearly a third from the place it was at just a few weeks ago. It’s trading at just under $8,000 a metric ton. That’s still nearly double where it started the year, but considerably lower than the $11,461 mark it reached on April 19.Wegovy and Ozempic: Are we ready for weight loss drugs?Many chocolate producers that use cocoa to make treats hedge their costs months in advance so they’re not exposed to the volatility of spot markets — Hershey told investors its cocoa supplies were locked up a year out — but Bloomberg reports the stuff got so expensive that even traders weren’t buying it anymore. Some who had short positions had to close them out, which contributed to the increase, and others were scared to buy new contracts that would leave them with physical deliveries too pricey end customers.On an earnings call last month, Peter Feld, CEO of Swiss chocolate processor Barry Callebaut, laid out all the reasons behind the dramatic increase:There is literally a supply reasons behind that, initially we know that the weather obviously was impacting the crop volume in Côte D’İvoire as well as in Ghana significantly in the main crop last fall, that was probably the first element.The second element that led to these price spikes were driven by large industrial players ordering very late, actually very, very late. And that whole situation then got amplified on top by hedge fund activity that actually played on top. So the thing went vertical.Periods of intense rain followed by drought in West Africa have reduced crop yields, in addition to swollen root disease that is affecting the health of cocoa trees. But the Financial Times noted that because cocoa prices were so much lower for a long time before the recent spike, farmers didn’t have the money to address the issues.

RWA protocol Untangled Finance debuts private credit pool on Celo - Crypto Briefing




Real-world asset (RWA) protocol Untangled Finance has announced its first on-chain securitization pool on the Celo blockchain. The pool is structured under Luxembourg’s securitization laws, collateralized by a diverse set of French working capital assets from fintech Karmen, and has a debt ceiling set at $6 million.The Credit Collective, supported by Fasanara Capital as the senior lender, has shown early support for this initiative, which is part of a larger €100 million senior facility agreement with Karmen. The pool offers access to credit analytics for verified investors who pass a comprehensive know-your-customer (KYC) process, ensuring asset protection against originator bankruptcy.“Traditionally, private credit has been accessible primarily to large financial institutions due to complexities in asset vetting and liquidity issues. At Untangled, our goal is to democratize access to these investment opportunities for DeFi investors worldwide in a risk-adjusted manner, while enhancing capital access and making financing more accessible for the growth engines of economies—SMEs,” stated Manrui Tang and Quan Le, co-founders of Untangled Finance. “As stablecoins continue to gain traction, these high-quality private credit securities provide robust backing, significantly enhancing their stability and reliability as a medium of exchange.”Untangled’s platform, which tokenizes real-world collateral like invoices and SME loans, has been operational since 2020 and has access to over 140 fintech lenders. Following the initial Karmen token pool, Untangled plans to launch additional pools, including the Fasanara Diversified Fund on-chain and a senior note backed by Eastern European invoice finance assets.“The Untangled Finance team is pioneering private credit tokenization,” said Isha Varshney, Head of Ecosystem at the Celo Foundation. “By bringing fintech lending onchain with an innovative credit assessment models, Untangled showcases the potential of tokenized real-world assets to improve access to funding and risk management for entrepreneurs and businesses worldwide.”RWA protocols usually aim for decentralized ecosystems with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL), such as Ethereum and Solana, as the RWA.xyz “Private Credit” dashboard shows. Despite its modest TVL of nearly $100 million, Tang explains that Celo was chosen for multiple reasons, including a mutual focus on RWAs as a key initiative and a shared vision for their future potential.“Untangled is multichain and will soon deploy on other blockchain platforms, We chose to start our journey with Celo […] We believe that community funding from groups like the Credit Collective will encourage the continued proliferation of RWAs. Recently USDC and USDT were natively deployed on Celo, making it easy for investors to transact,” she adds.Gabriel Thierry, co-founder & CEO of Karmen, highlights that this RWA effort bridges the decentralized and traditional finance sectors, enabling Karmen to accelerate its deployment of working capital loans for French SMBs.

Solana Is In Unprecedented Prime Condition, Says Developer


								In a post on X, Vibhu Norby, the CEO of the Solana-based company Drip Haus, has painted a detailed picture of Solana’s recent journey through scalability challenges and significant user growth. His analysis sheds light on both the obstacles and the advancements within the ecosystem.
Why Solana Is In The Best State Ever
Norby begins by recounting the substantial increase in network activity that Solana experienced between December and April due to the memecoin craze. He describes this period as both “exciting and challenging,” with the network peaking at 160,000 daily active users (DAUs) and over half a million new users onboarding.
Despite the surge, Norby points out a downside to this rapid expansion: the influx of “many low-quality wallets,” which he accepts as an inevitable aspect of such growth phases in blockchain networks. The increased load led to severe network congestion starting on March 2, escalating to a point where the blockchain became “unusable for us and practically everyone else” by the end of March.
Norby describes this period as “very sobering” for all developers involved with Solana’s decentralized applications (dApps), prompting a scramble to deploy solutions that were originally slated for a later stage. “The intense growth and then pullback pushed us to build fast and rush our scaling solutions to market that were probably normally a year out,” he explains.

Despite these challenges, the CEO’s tone shifts to one of optimism as he discusses the current state of Solana. “Now we sit at the door of the next phase, all the big puzzle pieces we envisioned are around the corner,” Norby notes, indicating a turning point for the network.
He reports that all key metrics have stabilized, with the network maintaining an impressive count of approximately 100,000 DAUs. He emphasizes Solana’s continued dominance in the crypto and collectibles space, highlighting its standing as “the biggest consumer product in crypto and collectibles by a wide margin.”
One of the most significant changes Norby highlights is the improvement in product quality, which he credits for the “incredible growth” in what Drip Haus refers to as “p5 DAUs.” This measure tracks the most engaged users who utilize the product as intended. Norby reveals that this group now consists of 25,000 daily users, describing this as the kind of dedicated user base “you dream of having for a consumer app.”

Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana based Helius Labs recently also celebrated Solana’s success in terms of DAUs. He remarked, “I’m generally against DAU metrics for blockchains (especially low-fee ones) but *returning* DAUs (meaning not new addresses via sybil) is useful to look at and that seems to be the highest it’s ever been in Solana history.

Norby’s enthusiasm escalated as he discussed the near future: “And I am so pumped about the next few months. I will be loud about it and keep pounding the vision. Only up.” This sentiment underscores a strong confidence in the continued growth and enhancement of the Solana ecosystem.
At press time, SOL traded at $137.5, up 10.5% in the last 24 hours.

Trader Who Called 2021 Collapse Issues Bitcoin Alert, Says BTC May Be In for More Downside - Here’s His Target - The Daily Hodl


								A trader known for several accurate crypto market calls says that Bitcoin (BTC) may not be done correcting after suddenly dropping below $58,000.
Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 146,700 followers on the social media platform X that he is closely watching to see if Bitcoin will hold as support at a key Fibonacci retracement level.










Based on historic precedence, the analyst had accurately predicted a possible move down to around $58,000.
“I don’t really see too much drama in BTC at the moment, still in the range, still some wiggle room down to the .382 fib, the standard of previous consolidations. Perhaps much of the nervousness comes from the fact that price moves in multiple thousands now that it is so high whereas in terms of percentages it is BTC normal.”
Source: Dave the Wave/X
However, the analyst warns a break below the .382 Fibonacci level, which is around $58,000, could send Bitcoin plummeting to around $48,000.
“$58,000 is the 0.382 real retracement of the recent move as commensurate with the previous. Effectively hit now. Let’s see if it holds. If not, could be in for a larger BTC correction down to $48,000 odd.” 
Source: Dave the Wave/X
He also warns that altcoins will likely plummet if Bitcoin continues to decline.
“If BTC moves down further, most likely alts will too. I’ve some bids set.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $57,017 at time of writing, down 5.9% at time of writing.

BlackRock Anticipates Renewed Institutional Interest In Bitcoin Spot ETFs - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) - Benzinga

Despite a recent pause in inflows to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after a continuous 71-day streak, industry experts predict a resurgence led by a broader investor base. What Happened: Robert Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock BLK, the world's leading asset management firm, suggests that the lull may soon be replaced by inflows from a variety of institutional investors.According to Mitchnick, financial giants such as sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and endowments are likely to begin engaging with spot ETFs in the upcoming months, Coindesk reported. “The re-initiation of the discussion around bitcoin is turning on how to allocate BTC into portfolio constructions,” Mitchnick explained during an interview. He further elaborated on the educational role BlackRock has been playing to facilitate this transition: “Many of these interested firms are having ongoing diligence and research conversations, and we're playing a role from an education perspective.”Since their approval in January, the pent-up demand for these ETFs has resulted in over $76 billion accumulated across various products. Mitchnick also highlighted that while some registered investment advisors (RIAs) are already offering BlackRock's IBIT ETF, a full-scale offering to clients of large wealth advisory firms like Morgan Stanley is anticipated soon.Social media buzz often revolves around the comparison of assets under management between different funds such as IBIT and Grayscale's GBTC. At present, IBIT holds about $17.2 billion, trailing behind GBTC's $24.3 billion. However, a significant portion of IBIT's assets is attributed to transitions from Grayscale and inflows from higher priced international products or bitcoin futures ETFs converting into spot products.Mitchnick pointed out that existing bitcoin holders prefer the ease of managing their cryptocurrency within a brokerage account, emphasizing the benefits over complexities like custody and tax reporting. “While becoming the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF would be an impressive milestone, BlackRock isn't really focused on that competition, but rather on educating its clients,” he stated.Also Read: Jack Dorsey’s Block Under Examination From Authorities Over Alleged Sanctions ViolationsWhy It Matters: BlackRock has also been preparing the groundwork for an Ethereum ETH/USD ETF, with CEO Larry Fink discussing the potential of tokenization and the representation of traditional assets on blockchains last November. Mitchnick posed a critical question regarding investor education in the complex Ethereum ecosystem and the rationale for diversifying into another crypto ETF when a spot bitcoin ETF could already be enhancing portfolio Sharpe ratios.Highlighting the broader potential, Mitchnick noted, “When we think about this space, we see the potential for digital assets to benefit our clients and capital markets, focusing on three areas: crypto assets, stablecoins and tokenization. These pillars are all interrelated, which is crucial for people to understand.”What’s Next: As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, discussions like these will be central at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, where industry leaders will converge to share insights and strategies for navigating the expanding world of digital finance.Image: Shutterstock

                        As the market recovers by 2.5% in the past 24 hours, we run through the best crypto to buy today, covering Pepe (PEPE), dogwifhat (WIF) and Optimism (OP).All three of these coins have outperformed the market as a whole, which has rebounded today after a very disappointing start to the week.Its losses stemmed in part from negativity surrounding the possibility that the Federal Reserve would hold rates as they are or even raise them, largely because inflation still remains relatively high.However, the Fed kept rates unchanged in its FOMC meeting yesterday, and it counteracted any negativity by also announcing that it would reduce the speed and severity of its recent quantitative tightening program.This came as a relief to markets, with the three cryptos featured below all benefiting more than most others.Best Crypto to Buy Today, May 2Pepe (PEPE)PEPE has rallied by an impressive 18% in the past 24 hours, reaching $0.057446 and easily cementing its position as one of the best cryptos to buy today.This price means it’s also up by 50% in a fortnight and by 520% in a year, with the meme token remaining highly popular among whales as a vehicle for profit.Source: TradingViewIn fact, data suggests that a whale has recently accumulated a large quantity of PEPE, having withdrawn more than $2 million in the token from Binance in the past 24 hours.Combined with PEPE’s bullish indicators, this would suggest that the token has more gains in store in the near term.Assuming the market as a whole continues to recover, it could reach $0.0000080 within a week, and potentially $0.000010 in a month or so.dogwifhat (WIF)WIF has jumped by 15% today, with its move to $2.76, which also represents a 12% gain in a fortnight.That said, the popular Solana meme token remains down by 28% in a month, while it’s also down by 43% in relation to its all-time high of $4,83, set in late March.Source: TradingViewSuch declines have given WIF’s chart quite a bearish appearance, even with the gains of the past couple of days.However, we are about to see the coin’s 30-day average (orange) overtake its 200-day (blue), providing a bullish reversal that could signal a period of sustained recovery.Indeed, its RSI (purple) has just hit 70 after spending around a week near or below 50, meaning that the market had oversold it recently.It’s also encouraging that its volume has climbed today, reaching approx. $675m from barely $275 million a couple of days ago.This could suggest that the WIF price will enjoy more rallies in the coming days, potentially helping it to return to $3 in the next one or two weeks.Optimism (OP)Rounding off this list of the best crypto to buy today is Optimism, which has recovered by 4.5% in the past 24 hours.It has reached $2.72, marking a 14% gain in a week and a 23% increase in a fortnight.This makes it one of the best-performing major tokens over these periods, even if it is up by only a modest 28% in a year.Source: TradingViewOP’s indicators give the impression that the altcoin – the native token of layer-two network Optimism – has recently begun a medium-term growth cycle.Its 30-day average climbed over its 200-day yesterday and is continuing to rise strongly, indicating plenty of momentum and buying pressure.Likewise, its relative strength index is hovering the 60 level and looks like it could rise some more in the next few days, meaning that OP’s price will rise with it.Other positive features include the fact that the coin’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are both moving up in parallel, implying that it will trade within a steadily rising band.And more fundamentally, Optimism remains one of the biggest layer-two Ethereum networks in the sector, with close to $1 billion in total value locked in.OP’s price should therefore see more joy in the coming days and weeks, potentially returning to $3 quite soon.Diversification Alternatives – Crypto Presales
The coins, above all, hold the potential for further gains in the shorter term, yet because they have already risen strongly recently, buyers need to be aware of the possibility of corrections.However, there are many newer tokens in the market that still have the potential to rally big in the near future, with presale coins, in particular, being one promising source of gains.Such coins are native to new projects that are opening their launch to investment from whale and retail investors, who can equally buy a token early before it becomes big.As with any other investment, investing in presales comes with risks, with some projects potentially failing to gain enough traction or adoption to become a success.Yet recent history has shown that some of the biggest sales can be highly lucrative for early investors.This is especially the case if a given project becomes successful and grows, something that can put initial investors in line to post big returns.To help investors identify the tokens that have the best chance of succeeding, analysts at Cryptonews have scoured the market for the best new presales.Best Presale to Buy in 2024

                        The Solana price has gained 10% in valuation today, with the SOL price moving to $137.28 as the cryptocurrency market as a whole posts a 2% increase in 24 hours.This move comes after a bad start to the week for the entire market, with SOL still down by 5% in the last seven days and by 23% in a month.However, the coin still sits on a 525% appreciation in the past year, and with it retaining plenty of medium- and long-term momentum, today’s recovery could easily continue over the next few days.Solana Price Prediction as SOL Gains 10% Overnight — Is It Time to Load Up?
Looking at Solana’s technicals, it’s initially hard to decide whether it’s going to come back down again or will see further rises in the near term.On the one hand, SOL’s relative strength index (purple) has touched 70 – an overbought position – and looks as though it has begun declining.Source: TradingViewOn the other hand, the coin’s 30-day average (orange) still hasn’t climbed over its 200-day (blue) yet, meaning that the token still has time for more gains before it becomes decidedly overbought.One thing that’s particularly positive about SOL’s chart today is that its trading volume has risen to $5 billion, up from only $2 billion a couple of days ago.In other words, there’s clearly a lot of demand to buy Solana at the discount offered by the recent downturn, with the alt still remaining the second-most popular alt among digital funds (behind Ethereum).The past 24 hours have also seen some very significant transfers, with one unknown wallet sending nearly $200 million in SOL to another unknown wallet in the past couple of hours. SOL’s fate in the near term depends on the wider market, which appears to have bottomed out after this week’s big fall but could still have a few more wobbles before returning to sustained growth.Part of the reason for market pessimism is that the Federal Reserve doesn’t look like it will cut rates anytime soon, having kept them where they were yesterday.Yet the expectation remains that rates will be cut later in the year, at which point the market will see more obvious joy.This will help the Solana price, which could hit $150 in a few weeks and $200 by the end of the summer.New Altcoins for New Rallies
Traders may not be overjoyed about having to wait several months for a big SOL rally, yet numerous newer tokens do have the potential to beat the market over a shorter time span.This includes several presale tokens, which can often rally big when listing, as a result of generating momentum during their sales.One of the newest and most interesting of these is Sealana (SEAL), a Solana-based meme coin that has just launched its token offering.Despite opening its sale only yesterday, it has already raised more than $100,000.Source: sealana.ioThis is a strong sign that investors are already taking a shine to Sealana, which is aiming to become the latest Solana meme token to storm the charts.It has adopted the ever-lovable seal as its meme mascot, with the Sealana character styled as a somewhat oafish trader who happens to make some big profits trading.Traders can purchase some as part of its sale by going to the official Sealana website, where they can send SOL to the following address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6cSEAL is available at an exchange rate of 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which works out to around $0.0199 at current prices.Buyers will receive the tokens they purchased via the coin’s airdrop, which will happen when the sale ends.And from there, Sealana will list on exchanges, where it could follow in the footsteps of DogWifHat and potentially moon.Buy SEAL Today

Justin Sun Applauds SHIB, Names Traits of Successful Coins - DailyCoin


        
Crypto billionaire Justin Sun weighs in on memecoins at Token 2049.



Mr. Sun sends a shoutout to Shiba Inu, piquing SHIB Army’s interest.



Shiba Inu whips up 8.8% gains on Thursday as BTC reclaimed $58K.
Cryptocurrency billionaire Justin Sun praised Shiba Inu (SHIB), as well as other competing memecurrencies, in a May 1 message on X.“Meme coins may seem unconventional, but they highlight the power of community in crypto,” reads Sun’s tweet, while a video snippet dives deeper into his stance. The interview was filmed at Token 2049, where Sun explained to a curious audience that whether a project is memecoin-based or not, it requires long-term dedication to succeed.What Makes SHIB so Successful?Alongside naming Dogecoin (DOGE) one of the “top crypto brands,” the TRON blockchain founder and owner of HTX asserted that every crypto project needs to cover a couple of cornerstones to achieve long-term success. 
Sun portrayed Shiba Inu (SHIB) as a cryptocurrency with one of the most vibrant communities. Community participation and social engagement played a pivotal part in SHIB’s growth over the first years of its inception on the blockchain.Sun stressed the importance of a fair token launch, which opens the door for major crypto exchanges to list the cryptocurrency and further bolster interest among retail investors.Half a year after its launch, Vitalik Buterin donated over 50 trillion SHIB tokens to India’s Crypto Relief fund, which was established to help people in need during the global pandemic. The altruistic deed warmed the hearts of dog lovers and crypto aficionados, now encompassing 3.8 million followers on X.Where Is Shiba Inu Heading Next?SHIB remains in the 12th position by global market capitalization, distanced from DOGE by $5.5 billion. Lately, Shiba Inu succumbed to the trials and tribulations of the ongoing crypto meltdown, most evident in Bitcoin’s (BTC) plunge to $56K last weekend. That symbolizes a 21.6% backtrack for the leading digital asset from its latest all-time peak at $73K, claimed just two months ago.
Sporting a high price correlation with BTC, SHIB also slipped by 11.8% over the past 30 days, recording a weekly low at $0.00002076, according to CoinGecko. Moreover, this concludes an 8.8% deficit in weekly terms for SHIB, similar to BTC.However, Shiba Inu’s support cluster from $0.000022 to $0.000023 assists in keeping it on track. At this level, 43.17T SHIB tokens are held in over 50,000 crypto wallet addresses. As of press time, Shiba Inu is exchanging hands at $0.00002287 with an 8.8% upswing over the past 24 hours.On the Flipside
The heated discussion about the alleged dangers of memecoins leading the crypto market started in March,when several blockchain enthusiasts sounded the alarm on “meme coins scaring away serious builders.”
Why This MattersMarch 2024 went down in the history books as the most successful period for the meme currency department, resulting in $56 billion at its bull cycle peak.Discover DailyCoin’s trending crypto news:Altcoin Season: Tips and Tactics for Market ResearchPolygon (MATIC) Plunges in BTC-Led Flush: Can It Hold Support?

U.Today presents to you the top three stories over the past day; don't miss this piece!500% spike in Shiba Inu token transaction fees shocks ShibariumYesterday, May 1, transaction fees on Shibarium, Shiba Inu's layer-2 solution, saw a significant increase. According to data by Shibariumscan, gas commissions paid in BONE surged from 12 BONE to 61.47 BONE, demonstrating 500% growth. The increase in fees on Shibarium can be explained by a number of factors, with the primary one being heightened network activity. Due to the recent rise in popularity of Shiba Inu tokens amid market instability and heightened investor interest, the demand for transactions on the Shibarium network has surged. The confirmation of this online activity spike is an extraordinary increase in active accounts, which jumped up by 211%, from 1,724 to 3,650 over the same 24-hour period.Bitcoin (BTC) at end of correction, top analyst suggestsDespite April being Bitcoin's worst month since October 2023 due to a substantial price plunge, Michael van de Poppe, renowned market analyst, believes that the flagship crypto is at the end of its correction. In his recent X post, van de Poppe wrote that BTC has plummeted by 20% from its recent highs, and there may be more downsides for the coin in the future. Even though a potential recovery is anticipated for Bitcoin from this point, the analyst stated that in the event of a further drop, one should closely watch the green zones between $56,000 and $58,000. Concluding his post, van de Poppe projected that altcoins will likely rebound before Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $59,156, up 3.27% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.Robinhood makes important announcement for Uniswap usersRobinhood, a popular online brokerage, has recently taken to X platform to announce that the Robinhood Connect feature has become available on Uniswap wallet. Thanks to the integration, users of the Uniswap mobile app are now able to purchase crypto assets with a debit card, via bank transfer or directly from their Robinhood balance. This option is available only to users from the United States. To celebrate this integration, Robinhood introduced a limited-time offer; the first time Robinhood Connect customers who buy at least $10 of crypto using Robinhood Connect in the Uniswap mobile app can get $10 in USDC as a reward. This development marks a significant step forward in enhancing accessibility and convenience for crypto investors.

Bitcoin Déjà Vu: Analyst Identifies Trends Reflecting 2016 Cycle


                            Cryptocurrency analyst Rekt Capital has come up with an intriguing narrative pointing to several trends in the current price action of Bitcoin that are similar to the price trends seen in the 2016 bull cycle, even as market sentiments continue to dwindle. 
Bitcoin Trends Reiterating 2016 Pattern
According to Rekt Capital, more than a month after the initial analysis, Bitcoin keeps demonstrating how much it closely resembles the cycle of 2016. Similar to 2016, Bitcoin has experienced further declines over the past three weeks following the Halving below the Range Low of its Re-Accumulation Range also known as the Post-Halving Danger Zone
The post read:
Over a month later Bitcoin continues to prove how it is more similar to the 2016 cycle. Just like in 2016, Bitcoin in this cycle is seeing additional downside below the Range Low of its Re-Accumulation Range in the three-week window after the Halving (i.e. Post-Halving “Danger Zone”).
Given that Rekt Capital already addressed the concept of the Post-Halving Danger Zone, the analyst is not shocked by this current price decrease. During the 2016 cycle, about 21 days after the Halving event, BTC saw a lengthy decline of 11% before transitioning toward an upward direction.

It is worth noting that Rekt Capital noted that if downside volatility around the Re-Accumulation Range Low is going to happen in this cycle, 2016 history indicates it may happen during the 15 days following the Halving. Since the recent event was concluded about 12 days ago, the expert’s prediction could be realized in the upcoming days. 
Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters ‘Danger Zone’ Post-Halving, Analyst Warns Of Potential Downside
While the Post-Halving “Danger Zone” ends in 15 days, 2016 data suggests that there may be some negative volatility in the interim, possibly reaching the $60600 Range Low.
Drawing attention to previous patterns, Rekt Capital highlighted a similar pattern between the 2016 and 2024 pre-Halving re-accumulation range. After a breakout from the re-accumulation range this year, BTC witnessed a Pre-Halving rally, as was observed in 2016.
Pre-Halving Retrace Movement
Just like in 2016, once the pre-Halving rally peaked, Bitcoin started its Pre-Halving retrace. Specifically, this occurred roughly 28 days prior to the Halving event in both 2016 and 2024.

A negative wick on the weekly candle indicates a significant reaction in the first week of the pre-Halving Retrace in 2016. However, this reaction was fleeting and came before an extended price decline.
This cycle likewise saw a strong early reaction from Bitcoin via a downward wick, but there are indications that this reaction might not have lasted long. Thus, to avoid a fate similar to that of 2016, Rekt Capital believes that BTC will need to maintain highs around $60,000 and beyond.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Key Burn Mystery Unraveled by Team Insider: Details

Shiba Inu team member Lucie recently delved into the discussion of burns, citing Shiba Inu's founder Ryoshi's burning of keys to the Shiba Inu supply.Lucie was responding to a comment on X by a community member who asked about Shiba Inu's lead, Shytoshi Kusama, and when burns were coming. In response to this, Lucie explained the reasoning behind Shiba Inu founder Ryoshi's decision to burn the keys to the Shiba Inu supply. Lucie explained that Ryoshi's burning of keys to the Shiba Inu supply "means that for anything to be burned, it must first be purchased." This implies that whatever would be destroyed must first be acquired. "In order to conduct burns, users need to generate income to facilitate the process," the SHIB team member further explained. Lucie also addressed calls that SHIB developers do something about burns, saying that Shiba Inu's lead, Shytoshi Kusama, and the other developers are not the key to burns. This is because they do not hold tokens to burn. Lucie highlighted that the SHIB community is the driving force behind burns, such as burning tokens or transactions. This explains why the focus is on drawing additional projects to Shibarium and encouraging users to bridge. Lucie claims this is how more SHIB will be burned. Shiba Inu layer 2 Shibarium to undergo hard forkThe impending hard fork of the Shibarium network marks a watershed moment in the evolution of Shiba Inu's blockchain ecosystem.The Shibarium hard fork includes significant updates to two key components of the Shiba Inu blockchain ecosystem: Bor and Heimdall. These fixes are intended to improve network efficiency, optimize consensus mechanisms and introduce additional scalability-supporting functions.The hard fork events are planned as follows: Shibarium Bor Hard Fork: May 2, 2:30 a.m. EST (block height: 4504576). The Shibarium Heimdall Hard Fork is slated for May 3 at 12:30 a.m. EST (block height: 3941864). This hard fork implements milestones to reach deterministic finality on the Shibarium network, which improves transaction confirmation reliability.

Peloton (PTON) Faces Disappointing Earnings, CEO Departure, and Debt Challenges - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ: PTON), the once-thriving exercise equipment company, continues to grapple with declining sales, leadership changes, and mounting debt. The company’s fiscal third-quarter results fell short of expectations, with revenue of $718 million slightly below the anticipated $723 million and a loss per share of 45 cents, surpassing the forecasted 37 cents loss. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue decline.



Leadership Overhaul and Strategic Transition



In a significant leadership shift, Barry McCarthy stepped down from his role as CEO after serving for two years, succeeding founder John Foley.As part of a broader strategic overhaul, the board has appointed Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo as interim co-CEOs while initiating a search for a permanent replacement. McCarthy will continue to serve as a strategic advisor until the end of the year, ensuring some continuity during the transition period.





Mounting Debt and Financial Restructuring



Peloton’s financial woes are further compounded by its accumulation of over $1 billion in debt and difficulties aligning spending with revenue.



In response to these challenges, the company has implemented cost-reduction measures, including layoffs and restructuring plans to reduce annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million by the end of fiscal 2025.



Additionally, Peloton is actively pursuing a refinancing strategy, working with major financial institutions like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to extend maturities and reduce leverage at a reasonable cost. The primary goals of this refinancing effort are to lower debt levels, extend the maturity of existing debts, improve financial stability, and potentially reduce the cost of capital.



Peloton Stock Plunges After Weak Fiscal Q3 Earnings



Peloton’s stock price currently stands at $2.78, reflecting a 13.66% decline from its last close.



The company’s year-to-date return of -52.15% significantly underperforms the S&P 500’s +5.75% return over the same period. Peloton’s stock has experienced a 67% decline over the past year and a staggering 97.14% drop over the last three years.



The market initially reacted positively to the news of the CEO’s departure and restructuring plans, with the stock surging more than 12% in premarket trading. However, following the company’s conference call, the stock opened over 6% lower, indicating ongoing investor concerns and uncertainty surrounding Peloton’s prospects.







Do you think a case can be made for Peloton’s recovery? Let us know in the comments below.

Nigerian court postpones money laundering trial of Binance and execs

The trial of Tigran Gambaryan, a Binance executive detained in Nigeria since February, has reportedly been postponed until May 17 after another delay in court.According to a May 2 Reuters report, lawyers representing Binance said they had not received documents necessary to move forward with a money laundering case involving the firm, Gambaryan, and regional manager Nadeem Anjarwalla. The trial was expected to begin on May 2, but a judge reportedly adjourned proceedings until May 17 to allow the legal team to review the documents.The trial is separate from tax evasion charges brought against Binance, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla by Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. All parties have pleaded not guilty in the money laundering case. A bail hearing for Gambaryan is scheduled for May 17. Anjarwalla and Gambaryan traveled to Nigeria in February to address claims that Binance manipulated the country’s fiat currency, the naira. Authorities detained and charged both men with tax evasion and money laundering, but Anjarwalla reportedly escaped custody and fled to Kenya, where he holds nationality in addition to the United Kingdom. Interpol reported on April 30 that extradition proceedings for Anjarwalla were moving forward.Related: Changpeng Zhao gets 4 months, Sam Bankman-Fried gets 25 years — Why?Many have criticized the Nigerian government’s charges as lacking merit. Authorities in the country detained both executives as Binance announced that it intended to cease all naira transactions, calling into question the timing of the arrests. Binance said Gambaryan had “no decision-making power” at the crypto firm.In a separate criminal case in the United States, a judge sentenced former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao to four months in prison on April 30 following his guilty plea for failing to maintain an Anti-Money Laundering program. Zhao is expected to report to a facility in Oregon or Washington at a date to be determined.Magazine: Lazarus Group’s favorite exploit revealed — Crypto hacks analysis

What are Parachains? Polkadot's Secret Weapon Explained - Decrypt

With an ever-growing number of blockchain projects, achieving interoperability and scalability between blockchains is increasingly important.Polkadot’s solution to this challenge is ‘parachains,’ a technical approach to allowing distinct blockchains to scale and work together effectively and safely, leveraging the Polkadot network’s guarantees of security, isolation, and communication.What are parachains?Unlike most other blockchains such as Ethereum, Polkadot isn’t built to have much inherent functionality. Instead, Polkadot acts as a ‘Relay Chain’ on top of which multiple parallel layer-1 blockchains, known as parachains, can be hosted side-by-side.These different blockchains can be built for specific use cases, and then come together to form an ‘internet of blockchains’. These different blockchains can all natively use Polkadot’s token DOT, as a common currency.By design, the Relay Chain does not support things like smart contracts, dapps, or even the ability to transfer assets. Instead, it works to find a consensus between different parachains performing the more outwardly facing use cases.This basic layer, which is called a ‘Layer-0 blockchain’, uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, much like Ethereum following its Merge in 2022.This consensus mechanism uses Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE). This is derived from Ouroboros, a protocol created by computer scientist Aggelos Kiayias, which is shared by Cardano.The web of parachains built around Polkadot are able to send not just tokens, but also data between one another. This means developers building around Polkadot can build services that take advantage of multiple distinct parachains, rather than one sole chain.You could compare this to how countries in the European Union (EU) maintain separate economies but can trade goods, services, and workers freely.Each separate parachain is free to set its own parameters, including transaction fees, block times, governance mechanism, and mining rewards.The vast majority of current parachains, as well as the Polkadot Relay Chain, use a development framework known as Substrate, provided by British technology firm Parity Technologies.However, although they are synergistic, they can be mutually exclusive—you don’t need to use Substrate to develop and maintain a parachain.Blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana, Tezos and Cardano run numerous smart contracts on one blockchain. As a result, their blockchains compete for the same limited computing resources within the network.Having multiple independent blockchains with their own computing resources can help reduce issues surrounding congestion, execution times and hard-to-predict running costs.There is currently a limit of around 100 parachains on Polkadot network, although in September 2023, Parity Technologies said that there is a roadmap to expand support to up to 1,000 parchains.Sidechains and parachains: what’s the difference?Parachains bear some outward similarities to ‘sidechains’: separate, related blockchains which are built on top of blockchains such as Ethereum—but they are markedly different.Sidechains also look to improve scalability and interoperability for blockchains. Examples of sidechains include the Polygon Network as well as the BNB Smart Chain (BSC).But sidechains each have their own consensus mechanism and token, whereas parachains on Polkadot share the same consensus mechanism, the Relay Chain.What is the Kusama network?A key underlying component of Polkadot’s network of parachains is the Kusama Network. This network acts as a sort of pre-production environment for Polkadot, or a sandbox that allows parachain developers to try out new ideas. It’s been described as a "canary network."Kusama still shares most of Polkadot’s major design features, but projects on Kusama have much less strict governance. This allows new projects to work out any technical flaws, as to build momentum and a loyal user base.Kusama is a functioning, independent, ‘real’ blockchain, rather than a ‘testnet’.A testnet is a blockchain that uses the same underlying framework as the parent blockchain but no real funds are used, and they don’t use the same coins as the main database.How are people using parachains?Developers are currently building parachains for a wide variety of different use cases. Some examples include:
⭐ Astar: One of the most popular parachains in terms of adoption, Astar incorporates Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) WebAssembly which allows developers to make dapps for applications such as DeFi, NFTs and DAOs.
📱 Nodle: This parachain aims to bridge Web3 and the physical world by turning smartphones into edge nodes that interact with sensors and devices in the physical world, using basic iOS and Android apps.
🌙 Moonbeam: A smart contract platform built using the Substrate blockchain framework, which allows developers to build decentralized apps (dapps) using smart contracts, which can integrate with networks such as Ethereum.
How do you start a parachain?To earn a place on the Polkadot network, projects need to competitively bid against each other via auctions. These auctions govern which projects get to connect to the Relay Chain and when.The number of successful places is intentionally kept scarce by the Web3 Foundation, as a means of increasing competition within the ecosystem.Once a project gains one of these invaluable leases, they last around 96 weeks. On the Kusama sister network, these leases last a maximum of 48 weeks.These auctions primarily work using ‘crowdloans’. Here, community members support their favorite projects by temporarily locking their tokens down in support of their favored projects.These are then kept in separate modules within the Relay Chain which is not in the project’s control. This helps to prevent ‘rugpulls’ by developers with bad intentions. If the bids are unsuccessful, the coins are automatically returned to their owners.What is the future of parachains?Though not available at the time of writing, the Polkadot Relay Chain is set for a major update, which will make significant changes to how the Relay Chain functions.The upcoming Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) upgrade would allow Polkadot’s Relay Chain to run more generic “services” including smart contracts; the Relay Chain will continue to support existing Substrate-based parachains.The Web3 Foundation is currently offering roughly $10 million of prize funds to developers implementing JAM. The prize pool looks to reward those working in different programming languages.As of April 2024, the JAM update is still subject to stakeholder approval, pending a vote by holders of Polkadot’s DOT token. The Polkadot community can currently vote on Referendum 682 to approve the upgrade. The graypaper which fully explains the technical changes to how the Relay Chain will work can be viewed here.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin mining firm Stronghold considers potential sale - Crypto Briefing




Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. (NASDAQ: SDIG), a vertically integrated Bitcoin mining firm, has announced the initiation of a formal strategic review process to explore alternatives for “maximizing shareholder value,” including the potential sale of all or part of the company.In its first-quarter 2024 earnings release, Stronghold reported revenues of $27.5 million, a 27% increase sequentially and a 59% increase year-over-year. The company also reported a GAAP Net Income of $5.8 million and a non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $8.7 million for the quarter. GAAP refers to “generally accepted accounting principles,” a set of accounting rules, standards, and guidelines that publicly traded companies in the US adhere to.The recently concluded earnings call from Stronghold mentioned that the firm has executed an agreement with Voltus, Inc. to assist in capturing demand response opportunities, which could further enhance economics when importing power from the grid.Notably, Stronghold has retained Cohen and Company Capital Markets as its financial advisor and Vinson & Elkins LLP as its legal advisor to support the company’s management team and board during the strategic review process.Stronghold, which operates two facilities that burn coal refuse to generate electricity for its mining operations, has a current market capitalization of nearly $40 million. The company’s shares, which were trading at around $11.25 in late 2023, have recently been trading at approximately $3.Despite these financial results, Stronghold’s board and management team have decided to explore strategic alternatives, citing a “valuation dislocation” when comparing the company’s market value to those of public Bitcoin mining peers, merchant power companies, and data center and power generation assets.“We believe that our 130 MW of existing Bitcoin mining capacity could potentially be expanded to over 400 MW for either Bitcoin mining or advanced computing, such as that which is used for artificial intelligence and machine learning,” said Greg Beard, chairman and CEO of Stronghold.The decision to explore strategic alternatives comes in the wake of the recent Bitcoin halving event, which has raised concerns about the profitability of mining operations. However, Stronghold’s press release did not explicitly attribute the decision to halving-related pricing, despite Beard’s statements that the mining company needs to adapt to the effects of Bitcoin halving on output efficiency.The company emphasized that there is no definitive timetable set for the completion of the review, and there can be no assurance that any proposal will be made or accepted, or that any transaction will be consummated.

Famous trader Peter Brandt has once again sparked a heated debate in the crypto community with his latest Bitcoin price prediction. In a recent social media post, Brandt asserted that if Bitcoin manages to maintain its current price levels and continues its upward trajectory, it could follow a classic pattern indicative of a bull market continuation.Brandt's analysis, accompanied by a chart depicting his vision, suggests that despite recent fluctuations, Bitcoin could be poised for a significant rally toward the $74,000 mark, revisiting its previous all-time high. This optimistic outlook, however, has not been universally embraced. "I'll welcome your money"Some skeptics have questioned Brandt's credibility, meaning his previous predictions suggested both a correction to $40,000 per BTC and the possibility that Bitcoin had already reached its peak. Nonetheless, Brandt remains resolute in his belief that the cryptocurrency is in the midst of a bull market, emphasizing the importance of adaptability in successful trading. Responding to criticism, Brandt rebuffed detractors, asserting his decades-long experience in trading and the necessity for flexibility in navigating volatile markets. In a direct challenge to one skeptic, Brandt confidently declared his readiness to capitalize on their doubts, suggesting they risked losing their capital in the process.Whether Bitcoin will indeed follow Brandt's projected trajectory remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the legendary trader has once again sparked debate and captured the attention of investors.

Pickup artists using AI, deep fake nudes outlawed, Rabbit R1 fail: AI Eye


            
AI Tupac vs. AI Drake



A little over a year ago, a fake AI song featuring Drake and the Weeknd racked up 20 million views in two days before Universal memory-holed the track for copyright violation. The shoe was on the other foot this week, however, when lawyers for the estate of Tupac Shakur threatened Drake with a lawsuit over his “TaylorMade” diss track against Kendrick Lamar, which used AI-faked vocals to “feature” Tupac. Drake has since pulled the track down from his X profile, although it’s not hard to find if you look.



Deep fake nudes criminalized



Apps like Nudeify simplify the process of creating deep fake nudes. (Nudeify)



The governments of Australia and the United Kingdom have both announced plans to criminalize the creation of deep fake pornography without the consent of the people portrayed. AI Eye reported in December that a range of apps, including Reface, DeepNude and Nudeify, make the creation of deepfakes easy for anyone with a smartphone. Deep fake nude creation websites have been receiving tens of millions of hits each month, according to Graphika.







Baltimore police have arrested the former athletic director of Pikesville High School, Dazhon Darien, over allegations he used AI voice cloning software to create a fake racism storm (“fakeism”) in retaliation against the school’s principal, who forced his resignation over the alleged theft of school funds.Darien sent audio of the principal supposedly making racist comments about black and Jewish students to another teacher, who passed it on to students, the media and the NAACP. The principal was forced to step down amid the outcry, however forensic analysis showed the audio was fake and detectives arrested Darien at the airport as he was about to fly to Houston with a gun.







Everyone — in the media at least — seems to hate Meta’s new AI integration in the Instagram search bar, mostly because it’s too eager to chat, and it’s not very good at search. The bot has also been joining Facebook conversations unprompted and talking nonsense after a question is asked in a group, and no one responds within an hour.



Defrocked AI priest



An AI Catholic Priest was defrocked after just two days for endorsing incest. The California-based Catholic Answers introduced the Father Justin chatbot last week to answer educational questions about the Catholic faith.



But after it started advising people they could baptize their children with Gatorade, and it blessed the “joyous occasion” of a brother and sister getting married, Catholic Answers was forced to apologize and demote the chatbot to plain old Justin. “Prevalent among users’ comments is criticism of the representation of the AI character as a priest,” CA said. “We won’t say he’s been laicized because he never was a real priest!”



It’s just “Justin” now. (Catholic Answers)



Rabbit R1 reviews



As soon as wildly popular tech reviewer Marques Brownlee said the Rabbit R1 “has a lot in common with Humane AI Pin” you knew the device was doomed — Brownlee absolutely slated Humane’s device two weeks ago. The Rabbit R1 is a much-hyped handheld AI device that you interact with primarily through voice, with it operating apps on your behalf. Brownlee criticized the device for being barely finished and “borderline non-functional”, with terrible battery life, and said it wasn’t very good at answering questions.



TechRadar called the R1 a “beautiful mess” and noted the market couldn’t support “a product that is so far from being ready for the mass consumer.” CNET’s reviewer said there were moments “when everything just clicked, and I understood the hype,” but they were vastly outweighed by the negatives. The main issue with the dedicated AI devices so far is they are more limited than smartphones, which already perform the same functions more effectively.






Fake live streams to hit on women



New apps called Parallel Live and Famefy use AI-generated audience interaction to fake big social media audiences for live streams – with pickup artists reportedly using the apps as social proof to impress women. In one video, influencer ItsPolaKid shows a woman in a bar that he’s “live streaming” to 20,000 people, she asks him if he’s rich, and they wind up leaving together. “The audience is AI generated, which can hear you and respond, which is hilarious. She couldn’t get enough,” the influencer said.The rule of thumb on social media is that whenever an influencer mentions a product, it’s probably an ad. Parallel Live creator Ethan Keiser has also released a bunch of promotional videos with millions of views, pushing a similar line that social proof from fake audiences can get models to fall all over you and invitations to the VIP sections of clubs. 404 Media’s Jason Koebler reported the apps use speech-to-text AI recognition, which meant fake AI viewers “responded” to things “I said out loud and referenced things I said aloud while testing the apps.”

“No-AI” guarantee for books



British author Richard Haywood is a self-publishing superstar, with his Undead series of post-apocalyptic novels selling more than 4 million copies. He’s now fighting zombie “authors” by adding a NO-AI label and warranty to all his books, with a “legally binding guarantee” that each novel was written without the aid of ChatGPT or other AI assistance. Haywood estimates that around 100,000 fake books churned out by AI have been published in the past year or so and believes an AI-free guarantee is the only way to protect authors and consumers.



AI reduces heart disease deaths by one-third



An AI trained on almost half a million ECG tests and survival data was used in Taiwan to identify the top 5% of most at-risk heart patients. A study in Nature reported that the AI reduced overall heart issue deaths among patients by 31%, and among high risk patients by 90%.



AIs are as stupid as we are



With large language models converging around the baseline for humans on a bunch of tests, Meta’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCunn, argues human intelligence could be the ceiling for LLMs due to the training data.




“As long as AI systems are trained to reproduce human-generated data (e.g. text) and have no search/planning/reasoning capability, performance will saturate below or around human level.”




AbacusAI CEO Bindu Reddy agrees that “models have hit a wall” despite progressively more computing and data being added. “So in some sense, it’s actually not possible to get past some level with just plain language models,” she said, although she added that “No one knows what ‘superhuman reasoning’ looks like. Even if LLMs manifested these superhuman abilities, we wouldn’t be able to recognize them.”



AIs are flatlining around human intelligence (Pedro Domingo X)



Safety board doesn’t believe in open source



The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has enlisted the heads of centralized AI companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet and Nvidia, for its new AI Safety and Security Board. But the board has been criticized for not including a representative of Meta, which has an open-source AI model strategy, or indeed anyone else working on open-source AI. Maybe it’s already been deemed unsafe.

Peter Schiff Mocks Bitcoin's Dip Below $60K: "Party's Over" - DailyCoin


        
The ongoing Bitcoin price dip has triggered criticism from the anti-crypto community.



Peter Schiff is once again reveling in the token giant’s underperformance.



Bitcoin is currently experiencing its second-longest cycle pullback.
The past weeks in the crypto market have been turbulent for Bitcoin (BTC), characterized by heightened uncertainty and significant price fluctuations. This volatility recently reached a climax when the token experienced a sharp price decline, breaching its longstanding support level of $60,000.This latest downturn has once again underscored the inherent volatility of Bitcoin, drawing scrutiny from the anti-BTC crowd.Peter Schiff on BTC Dip: “Turn out the lights, HODLers”In a tweet on Wednesday, May 1, gold advocate and Bitcoin hater Peter Schiff slammed BTC’s present bearish momentum, asserting its inability to hold support at $60,000. 
Echoing his previous predictions that BTC would struggle to sustain the support level, Schiff ridiculed the token’s underperformance despite the recent spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launch, emphasizing its 23% decline in value and a more substantial 33% fall against gold.Schiff analyzed Bitcoin’s price movements, noting that while $60,000 previously constituted a support level for Bitcoin, it has become a resistance level. He further identified a short-term head-and-shoulders pattern forming in BTC’s price, suggesting a potential further decline in price with a downside objective of $54,000.While his comments build on his long-standing skepticism and repeated criticisms of the token, they align with the current negative sentiment surrounding the token.BTC Pullback Nears Deepest YetPer market analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin’s ongoing retracement marks the deepest decline yet, officially recorded at 23.6%. This surpasses the deepest retracement observed in early 2023, constituting only a 22.9% decline.
The ongoing pullback has lasted 48 days, the second-longest in this cycle. If it proceeds, the retrace could potentially surpass the previous record for the longest pullback, which lasted 63 days.However, Rekt Capital offered a silver lining. According to its analysis, the more Bitcoin consolidates anywhere between current price levels and $70,000 post-halving, the more likely it is for the overall market cycle to slow down and align with the historically recurring pattern observed after Bitcoin’s halving events. Rekt added that this pattern typically leads to a peak in the bull market, which could see the ongoing cycle peak around mid-September to October 2025.On the FlipsideWhy This MattersPeter Schiff’s critique of Bitcoin’s dip reflects the criticisms the crypto market still faces, ingrained in the question of its position as a store of value. However, the crypto market is no stranger to price crashes, and while negative, BTC’s current performance is not enough to override its potential.Here’s how the bearish sentiment is rippling through the industry:Crypto Bear Sentiment Grips Investors as Fear Spikes The downward market trend has also impacted the recently launched ETFs in Hong Kong:Analysts Evaluate Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs’ Disappointing Debut

The Open Network (TON) secures fresh funding from Pantera Capital - Crypto Briefing




Pantera Capital, managing over $5 billion in assets, has recently made an undisclosed investment in The Open Network (TON), a prominent layer 1 blockchain. Pantera’s move demonstrates its strong belief in TON’s potential to drive widespread crypto adoption, leveraging Telegram’s 900 million users and over 1 trillion monthly views.“We believe the TON network is still in its early stages and we are excited to see the adoption of the ecosystem and its new features by Telegram users,” Pantera Capital told The Block.Originally developed by Telegram’s team and rebranded following legal hurdles with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, TON has since made considerable advancements.The network has become a bustling web3 ecosystem, sharing revenue with channel owners, and facilitating advertising payments in TON. Also, speculations suggest that TON, Haskey Group, and Oyster Labs have joined forces to launch the ‘Universal Basic Smartphone.’Besides, the TON blockchain has also gained traction recently. Last month, Tether integrated Tether USD (USDT) and Tether Gold (XAUT) onto TON blockchain. This integration expands Tether’s reach to 15 blockchains and unlocks new possibilities for over 900 million Telegram users worldwide. As a result, users can now leverage USDT and XAUT for peer-to-peer payments directly on the TON blockchain and within decentralized applications built on its infrastructure.Pavel Durov, the co-founder and CEO of Telegram, also announced the company’s plans to tokenize its stickers and emojis, transforming them into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the TON blockchain.Durov highlighted TON’s scalability as a key factor in this decision. According to him, TON’s ability to handle millions, even hundreds of millions, of transactions, making it a perfect fit for Telegram’s target scale.Pantera Capital’s latest investment comes as the company is finalizing KYC procedures for a Solana token purchase. The firm is also in talks to raise an additional $1 billion for “Pantera Fund V.” This new fund targets early-stage startups, tokens, and other digital assets.

Dirty To Digital: Coal Miner Strikes $7 Million Bitcoin Gold With Excess Power


								Alliance Resource Partners (ARLP), a publicly traded coal mining company, has successfully ventured into Bitcoin mining. The pilot project, which began in 2020, has generated significant revenue for ARLP by capitalizing on underutilized electricity at its River View mine.

Bitcoin Mining Success And Adaptability
ARLP’s strategic foray into crypto mining has proven fruitful, with the company generating 425 BTC worth $30 million. CFO Cary Marshall, during an earnings call, highlighted the company’s ability to adapt and generate revenue from existing resources. ARLP’s focus has been solely on mining with their existing equipment, rather than actively buying Bitcoin.
The success of the pilot project is undeniable, as ARLP effectively harnesses its excess power to mine the leading cryptocurrency. However, questions surrounding long-term profitability and environmental impact have cast a shadow over this innovative venture.
Challenges And Market Fluctuations
While ARLP’s Bitcoin holdings are currently valued at $30 million, operational costs significantly reduce that figure to $7.3 million. The recent halving event, which saw a reduction in block rewards for miners, has added further complexity to the project’s profitability.
In response to reduced profitability, miners have been observed transferring their Bitcoin to exchanges, potentially signaling a selling spree. This trend helps miners cover operational costs but also creates a market imbalance that could impact the crypto asset’s overall price.

BTCUSD trading at $58,728 on the weekly chart: TradingView.com
Finding Balance For A Sustainable Future
Emerging technology and established industries come together in an intriguing way at ARLP’s exploration into Bitcoin mining. But a number of things will determine if this paradigm is sustainable in the long run. Sustained profitability will depend critically on the direction of BTC price and ARLP’s capacity to maximize efficiency.
Moreover, the environmental impact of coal-powered Bitcoin mining cannot be overlooked. ARLP recognizes the importance of addressing these concerns to secure a sustainable future for its Bitcoin mining endeavors. Balancing profitability with environmental considerations will be essential for the company’s success and reputation in an increasingly environmentally conscious world.
A Valuable Case Study
ARLP’s pioneering experience in Bitcoin mining serves as a valuable case study for traditional companies venturing into the digital asset space. It sheds light on the potential rewards and challenges faced by these companies as they navigate a complex and evolving landscape.
As the industry continues to evolve, ARLP’s success demonstrates the potential for traditional industries to adapt and thrive in emerging sectors. It also highlights the need for careful consideration of market fluctuations, operational costs, and environmental sustainability in order to achieve long-term success.

Alliance Resource Partners’ entry into crypto mining has generated substantial revenue, showcasing the company’s adaptability and innovative spirit. However, the long-term profitability of their venture depends on various factors, including Bitcoin’s price trajectory and the optimization of operational efficiency.
Addressing environmental concerns associated with coal-powered Bitcoin mining will be crucial for ARLP to ensure a sustainable future.

EMURGO on Revolutionizing the Precious Metals Industry through Tokenization | Cryptoglobe


                                
EMURGO is a global blockchain technology company. It acts as the official commercial and venture arm of the Cardano project, which is a decentralized blockchain platform that runs the ADA cryptocurrency. EMURGO aims to foster the development of the Cardano ecosystem by investing in startups and companies that are building on the Cardano platform. The company provides solutions and services to businesses and governments in industries ranging from finance and healthcare to education and retail, helping integrate blockchain technology into their operations.



The precious metals industry involves a complex network of stakeholders, including mines, ports, refineries, and exchanges. As EMURGO points out, the intricacies of this network make precious metals an ideal candidate for asset tokenization, which could bring about significant advancements in transparency, liquidity, and stakeholder accountability.



In a blog post published earlier today, EMURGO describes precious metals as rare, naturally occurring commodities that have served as a cornerstone of economic value due to their durability, beauty, and rarity. Historically used in both industrial applications and as investment assets, these metals are pivotal in various sectors.



Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), as EMURGO explains, are digital representations of physical assets on a blockchain, with all relevant transactions and information recorded for verification. This digital shift could provide clearer accountability and improve the efficiency of how these assets are managed and transacted.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

According to EMURGO, tokenizing precious metals can offer several benefits:



Affordability: By fragmenting a tokenized asset into smaller portions, more individuals can invest in precious metals without the need for large upfront costs.Security: Blockchain technology allows for transparent transaction tracking, potentially reducing human accounting errors and enhancing investment security.Anti-counterfeit Measures: Tokenization can help verify the authenticity of precious metals, addressing issues of counterfeiting and illegal mining practices.Reduced Transaction Costs: With fewer intermediaries involved, the transaction costs associated with trading precious metals could decrease, making it more efficient.Global Market Access: EMURGO notes that tokenization could connect stakeholders worldwide, simplifying logistics and trading processes.



EMURGO says NMKR allows the Cardano blockchain to be used to issue NFTs for various assets, including physical diamonds through its partnership with Tiamonds and e-books with Book.io, promoting true ownership and resale capabilities.



EMURGO says that 2.2 million NFTs have been issued with the help of NMKR, and transaction volumes exceed $65 million across more than 30,000 projects.

Poloniex delists own WBTC product following depeg


Following Protos reporting about Wrapped Bitcoin on Tron (WBTC) depegging on Poloniex, the Justin Sun-owned firm behind the product appears to have removed this asset from trading. 
The previously available WBTC/BTC pair looks to have been removed entirely, and the WBTC/USDT pair currently states, “Currently trading for WBTC/USDT is disabled. The price may not reflect current market.”
It’s not clear if it’s currently possible to redeem WBTC for BTC through Poloniex.
Additionally, Poloniex has yet to complete the promised proof-of-reserves process and still hasn’t disclosed where it stores the bitcoin supposedly reserving this product.

WBTC, managed by Justin Sun-owned Poloniex, currently makes up over half the bitcoin on Sun-connected exchange HTX. Additionally, there’s approximately $5.36 billion worth of the product on Sun-launched JustLend.
This opaque financial instrument connects a number of Sun-affiliated entities and projects in a way that raises concerns about the management of both the instrument and the entities.
Protos has reached out to Poloniex to determine where the reserves for this product are held, if it is still possible to redeem, and why this asset was delisted for trading. At press, Poloniex had not responded.

What Is the Price of Solana (SOL) up Today? | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of smart contract platform Solana ($SOL) defied the recent crypto market slump with an impressive price surge today, climbing over 10% in the last 24 hours to hit $138.2 at the time of writing.



This upswing can be attributed to a combination of positive developments within the Solana ecosystem and a shift in the broader economic landscape. The continued popularity of Solana-based memecoins, which have boosted activity on the platform, has been influence the rise of Solana’s decentralized finance sector, with data also showing Solana investment products have been seeing significant inflows amid the market downturn.



SOLUSD price chart via CryptoCompare



The total value locked on decentralized finance protocols within the Solana network has risen to $3.78 billion, from little over $200 million at the beginning of last year and from around $1.3 billion at the beginning of this year.



Solana’s price action has also played a role in the recent upswing as the cryptocurrency has recently found support at a key level in recent months, indicating strong buying pressure. This technical resilience, bolstered by the 200-day exponential moving average, has instilled confidence in investors and created a potential springboard for further gains.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Adding to the positive sentiment, a new cross-chain bridge service connecting Bitcoin and Solana was recently announced and is scheduled for release later this year has fueled excitement. Developed by Zeus Network, the cross-chain bridge allow users to convert their Bitcoin into zBTC tokens, usable within the Solana ecosystem.



Solana’s gains today also coincide with a broader crypto market recovery following a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve after the central bank opted to maintain interest rates at their current levels due to concerns surrounding slowing economic growth.



This decision, coupled with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s statement that further rate hikes are unlikely in the near future, has boosted investor risk appetite. As yields on traditional investments like government bonds dipped, investors sought higher returns in assets like cryptocurrencies, potentially contributing to Solana’s upswing.

Powell Rally Vanishes, Qualcomm Heightens Apple Concern, Mother Of All Reports Ahead - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - Benzinga

To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.Key Events AheadPlease click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).Note the following:
	The chart shows the steep rally that started on Powell’s press conference.
	Yesterday, we wrote:

If political Powell shows up, expect a rip roaring rally.

	Three groups of investors were buying.
	
		Investors driven by macro bought on the belief that Powell gave an all clear signal for buying stocks.
		Investors who follow traditional technical analysis aggressively bought because a technical buy signal triggered.
		The momo crowd was buying because dovish Powell showed up.
	
	
	The chart shows that at the peak of the rally when buying was very aggressive, The Arora Report took a contrary view and wrote in the Afternoon Capsule:

In The Arora Report analysis, there may be a re-think of the stock market rally as Powell was not able to support his dovishness with data or compelling argument.

	The chart shows that The Arora Report call has proven prescient as all of the stock market rally was given back.
	Two key events are ahead:
	
		Apple Inc AAPL earnings
		Jobs report, also known as the mother of all reports
	
	
	The momo crowd’s pattern is to buy ahead of key events. The reason is that the momo crowd buys on hopium and does not take risk into account. Today is no different. The momo crowd is aggressively buying ahead of Apple earnings and the mother of all reports. In contrast, smart money knows that key events present risk.  To reduce risk, smart money tends to trim ahead of key events.
	Apple will report earnings after the market close.  Here are the key points:
	
		Analysts expect about a 5% drop in Apple revenues.
		If analysts are right, this will be the fifth of the last six quarters with a drop in Apple revenues.
		We have been sharing with you the problems Apple is facing in China.
		Qualcomm Inc QCOM owns patents on key technologies that power today’s smartphones, including iPhones. As full disclosure, QCOM is in The Arora Report's ZYX Buy Model Portfolio.  QCOM long from $47.13.  Apple is a key Qualcomm customer.  QCOM data shows that it generated great revenues in China.  The implication here is that other companies such as Huawei are taking significant market share from Apple as Chinese switch away from iPhones.  
		As full disclosure, AAPL is in The Arora Report's ZYX Buy Model Portfolio.  AAPL is long from $4.68.  
		Apple earnings are very important.  Risks to Apple are also very important.  Institutions are selling AAPL stock.  It is important to become knowledgeable about Apple.  
	
	
	The jobs report will be released at 8:30am ET tomorrow.
	Initial jobless claims came at 208K vs. 213K consensus. This indicates that the employment picture remains strong.
	Q1 Productivity-Prel came at 0.3% vs. 0.8% consensus.   This indicates that AI has not become as pervasive in the workplace as some prior data indicated.
	Q1 unit labor costs-Prel came at 4.7% vs. 2.5% consensus.  This indicates that taming inflation is a challenge.
Magnificent Seven Money FlowsIn the early trade, money flows are positive in AAPL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc META, Microsoft Corp MSFT, NVIDIA Corp NVDA, and Tesla Inc TSLA.In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Alphabet Inc Class C GOOG.In the early trade, money flows are positive in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ.Momo Crowd And Smart Money In StocksThe momo crowd is aggressively buying stocks in the early trade.  Smart money is inactive in the early trade.GoldAs we are ready to publish this post, all of a sudden, significant selling is coming in gold.The momo crowd is buying gold in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade.For longer-term, please see gold and silver ratings.The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust GLD. The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust SLV. OilAs we are ready to publish this post, all of a sudden, significant selling is coming in oil.The momo crowd is buying oil in the early trade.  Smart money is inactive in the early trade.For longer-term, please see oil ratings.The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF USO.BitcoinBitcoin BTC/USD is seeing buying on dovish Powell.Protection Band And What To Do NowIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Traditional 60/40 PortfolioProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.  Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

Bitcoin ETFs Shed $563 Million as BlackRock's IBIT Marks First Daily Loss - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsSpot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States marked their worst day on record Wednesday, notching more than half a billion dollars in net outflows for the first time since their January debut.As Bitcoin’s price fell to its lowest point in two months Wednesday, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $563 million in net outflows, according to data from CoinGlass—far exceeding a previous record of $326 million in daily net outflows seen in mid-March.The outsized bleed from Bitcoin funds came as the Federal Reserve affirmed that its fight against inflation is likely far from over. The U.S. central bank kept interest rates fixed at their highest levels in over 23 years following its May policy meeting.At the same time, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said tighter monetary policy that could weigh on risk assets like stocks and crypto was “unlikely” to be next. Following his remarks, Bitcoin climbed to $58,500, yet it remains down 8% over the past week.As the selloff materialized Wednesday, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF saw outflows for the first time. Amassing $15.4 billion uninterrupted since its Wall Street launch, the iShare Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw outflows of $37 million, according to Farside Investors.At the same time, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has seen over $17 billion in cumulative outflows since January, didn’t hemorrhage the most cash Wednesday. Instead, holders of Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF led the selloff, which saw $191 million leave the fund as GBTC witnessed outflows of $167 million.Outflows from GBTC—which was converted to a spot ETF in January after a decade on the market—have been tied to the bankruptcy estates of several crypto firms parting with shares. Grayscale’s management fee of 1.5% for GBTC also stands out as other products charge investors around 0.25%—offering cheaper alternatives.Spot Bitcoin ETFs have the potential to “amplify market downturns,” analysts from crypto analytics firm Kaiko wrote in a report released alongside Moody’s Wednesday. “If there is an event that triggers large outflows, ETF issuers will need to liquidate their holdings, which could weaken values in crypto markets,” it stated.In mid-March, spot Bitcoin ETFs had $63 billion in assets under management (AUM). But amid Bitcoin’s recent slide, the market value of their Bitcoin holdings (plus a tiny amount of cash) has fallen 19% to $51.4 billionWith net outflows on Wednesday representing 1% of spot Bitcoin ETFs’ AUM, the outflows appeared “totally normal for [a] risk asset ETF during [a] selloff,” Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said on Twitter. If Bitcoin’s “correction worsens,” however, he said the ETFs’ AUM could drop 10%—and he “wouldn’t be surprised.”Though spot Bitcoin ETFs saw more than half a billion dollars in net outflows Wednesday, the price of Bitcoin is still up 33% year-to-date, partially due to the supply and demand dynamics ushered in by the products.“The flywheel works both to the upside and downside,” pseudonymous crypto trader WhalePanda said on Twitter of spot Bitcoin ETFs, adding the outflows aren’t “a surprise since panic is everywhere.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Ethereum and Solana Meme Coin Prices Surge Amid Modest Bitcoin Gains - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin has been struggling lately, though its modest gains Thursday are surely a welcome sign of life for traders. But Bitcoin's slight rise is being overshadowed by a crypto category that is on fire today: meme coins.Pepe (PEPE) is the biggest winner, shooting up by over 22% in the past day per data from CoinGecko. The Ethereum-based token hasn't seen much price action over the past week, though, but still is up by over 8% in the past 30 days.Over the past day, the Solana-based Bonk (BONK) has boomed by over 18%; it's now priced at $0.00002479, CoinGecko shows. Meanwhile Dogwifhat (WIF) and FLOKI have both made notable gains—they're up 14% and 12%, respectively, making them two of the other biggest gainers over a 24-hour period.And long-standing meme coins Dogecoin (DOGE) and the Ethereum-based Shiba Inu (SHIB) have each posted 24-hour gains around 9%, adding to Thursday's meme coin frenzy.The boom in meme coins and tokens comes at a time when the broader crypto market has taken a plunge. This week, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies took a nosedive after investors cashed out of the popular spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and U.S. inflation proved sticker than expected.Bitcoin is now trading for $59,000 after plunging by nearly 8% over seven days. It's now well below its March all-time high of nearly $74,000 per coin.The meme coin and token market is risky: New cryptocurrencies disappear almost as quickly as they spring into existence, either making traders huge gains or crushing losses.Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz's CTO Eddy Lazzarin last week described the sphere as a "risky casino" that is "damaging" for the world of crypto.A lot of it was started a joke. Dogecoin, the biggest meme coin in existence with a market cap of $18.8 billion, was created to poke fun at the serious world of Bitcoin, according to its developers.It's now the ninth biggest digital asset by market cap. And it has countless followers piling up billions in collective market value.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Creator of rabbit AI assistant has hidden NFT past


Founders of rabbit r1, a supposed competitor to the smartphone, are also behind the launch of a failed NFT project that they’re reportedly hiding from the web. 
The $200 rabbit r1 was created by CEO Jesse Lyu and billed as the ‘future of human-machine interface.’ However, its sleek design and funky scrolling weren’t enough to woo techies and the device was roundly criticized on release. 
Now rabbit r1’s negative reception has brought attention to Lyu’s prior work on a failed NFT project called Gama. Lyu was CEO of Gama’s parent company, Cyber Manufacture Co., before it rebranded to rabbit Inc. in October 2023. 

VIDEO
Promotional material shared on Gama’s YouTube channel. 
Gama claimed to be a ‘premium’ space-themed 3D platformer that incorporated NFTs and was pitched in 2022 as the metaverse of the future. However, barely two years later, the Gama.io domain no longer works and the site can only be viewed via the Wayback Machine internet archive.
One post on X from AI advocate Andy Parackal claims that the Gama team has been deleting every YouTube video involving rabbit’s CEO. Fortunately, Parackal says he recorded one of Lyu’s interviews before it was wiped. 
He said, “We got the entire video; these guys are total grifters. I’ve been saying from day one that these guys are sketchy… They are trying to delete everything involved with Gama NFTs.” 

Indeed the Gama YouTube channel does contain videos relating to the Gama project, but nothing including Lyu. 
Aaron Li, who claims to have built the technical systems behind Gama, told Parackal he wasn’t told to delete anything and that Parackal “may be overreacting.”
Rabbit Inc. CEO’s NFT history adds to growing complaints 
The rabbit r1 relies on AI to perform various tasks its creators hoped would eliminate the need to scroll back and forth between multiple apps. But it’s been met with growing criticism.
Tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee said in a review that the rabbit r1’s AI “hallucinates” and “confidently answers questions wrong.” He calls its battery life “brutally bad,” describes its scroll function as “super slow,” and complains about its restrictive touch screen.

The Verge also reported that rabbit r1’s operating system isn’t as unique from apps as rabbit Inc. makes out. Indeed, someone is reportedly running rabbit’s launcher as an Android app on a Google Pixel 6A. 
In response, rabbit told The Verge, “rabbit r1 is not an Android app… rabbit OS and LAM run on the cloud with very bespoke AOSP and lower level firmware modifications, therefore a local bootleg APK without the proper OS and Cloud endpoints won’t be able to access our service. rabbit OS is customized for r1 and we do not support third-party clients.”
A full response can be found on its X account. 
Protos has emailed rabbit Inc. for more information about Jesse Lyu’s NFT project and the reported deletion of videos and will update this piece if we hear back.

US banking JPMorgan has maintained a cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, according to its latest report that was published on Apr. 23. According to JPMorgan, the cryptocurrency market is currently suffering from the lack of bullish catalysts after ETF inflows dried up. At the same time, the bank's analysts cited elevated positioning, underwhelming venture capital (VC) funding, and the current production costs as the main bearish catalysts contributing to the ongoing selling pressure. Last month, JPMorgan predicted that the Bitcoin halving was priced in, pouring cold water on some bullish predictions. Back in February, it said that the price of the largest cryptocurrency could crash to as low as $42,000 after the halving event. The bank also predicted that the production cost of a single coin could roughly double. Around that time, Bitcoin bull Mike Novogratz also warned that the Bitcoin market was getting frothy. The price of Bitcoin surged to its current all-time high of $73,737 in March and went on to log eight consecutive green monthly candles. However, it experienced a dramatic correction in April and then kept plunging in May due to disastrous ETF outflows and macroeconomic concerns. The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at $59,110.Meanwhile, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently doubled down on his long-standing criticism of Bitcoin, calling the largest cryptocurrency "a fraud" and a "Ponzi scheme." He also predicted that the flagship cryptocurrency would not go anywhere as a currency. At the same time, he still sees some value in blockchain technology.

Important Binance Announcement Concerning Numerous Altcoin Traders: Details


																TL;DR

Binance recently expanded its Loan service to include new assets such as Holo (HOT) and Manta Network (MANTA), requiring users to update their app versions to place orders.
The prices of these newly added tokens increased following the announcement, possibly driven by the broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market.


The Latest Update
The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange launched another upgrade on its platform to offer additional services and respond to reigning market trends. Most recently, it added Holo (HOT), Jito (JTO), Manta Network (MANTA), MANTRA (OM), NFPrompt (NFP), and Portal (PORTAL) as new loanable assets on Binance Loans (Flexible Rates).
The company advised clients who wish to place orders via the application to upgrade it to iOS v2.78.0 or Android v2.78.0 (or later). “Older app versions no longer support the placement of new Binance Loans (Flexible Rate) orders,” it warned. 
The prices of most of the assets included in the exchange’s latest update have headed north shortly after the announcement. JTO is up 13% on a 24-hour scale, MANTA has surged by 7%, while NFP has witnessed a 5% spike. 
The additional support from Binance might be one reason the aforementioned coins entered a bullish mode. Another factor could be the evident revival of the entire cryptocurrency market today (May 2). Many of the leading digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA), are well in the green after suffering substantial losses in the previous days.




The Previous Amendments
The exchange introduced multiple updates on its platform in the last several weeks. It added 18 new loanable assets, such as the popular meme coins Pepe (PEPE) and dogwifhat (WIF), to Binance Loan at the beginning of April. Shortly after, it launched the ARB/USDC and NEO/USDC perpetual contracts with up to 50x leverage, while FIL/USDC enables up to 75x leverage.
Earlier this week, the company included the XRP/JPY, SHIB/JPY, ADA/JPY, and SOL/JPY trading pairs on Binance Spot. 
The options focus on the Japanese yen, giving locals the chance to dive deeper in the cryptocurrency industry. “Users will enjoy zero maker and taker fees on JPY trading pairs until further notice,” the firm clarified.
Prior to that, Binance simplified crypto trading for Mexicans, too, by launching a direct pair between USDT and MXN.

XRP Receives Crucial Adoption Boost With New RippleX Feature


RippleX, the development arm of Ripple, has introduced a significant enhancement to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) aimed at enhancing adoption and usability. Senior Software Engineer at RippleX Mayukha Vadari revealed the release of a new specification, XLS-68d, designed to simplify transaction processes.The focal point of this development is the introduction of sponsored transaction fees and reserves. This feature enables platforms to handle transaction fees and account reserves on behalf of their users, thereby streamlining the user experience and reducing barriers to entry for new participants.The proposal acknowledges the growing complexity of blockchain technology and aims to address it by allowing users to delegate transaction management while retaining control over their accounts. Users can authorize platforms to execute transactions and cover associated fees and reserves by including sponsor signatures in their transactions. Similar functionalities exist on other blockchain networks and are often referred to as "sponsored transactions" or "meta-transactions." This aligns with industry trends and provides users with familiar mechanisms for managing transactions.The introduction of this feature is expected to have a positive impact on the XRPL ecosystem by facilitating easier onboarding processes and reducing financial barriers for users and projects. By enabling platforms to cover transaction costs, XRP becomes more accessible to a wider range of users and industries, potentially driving increased adoption.Overall, the introduction of sponsored transaction fees and reserves represents a significant step forward in enhancing the adoption and usability of XRP, positioning it as a more user-friendly and accessible digital asset.

Crypto confiscate: Carabinieri and Young Platform in collaboration

For the first time, the cryptocurrencies seized from a criminal organization, then brought to justice, have been converted into fiat currencies thanks to the collaboration between the main Italian exchange Young Platform and the Carabinieri.
Let’s see below all the details. 

The partnership between the Carabinieri and the Italian crypto exchange Young Platform against financial crime
As anticipated, the first successful conversion of confiscated cryptocurrencies to fiat currency has been completed.
This pioneering initiative highlights a remarkable step forward in the collaboration between the cryptocurrency sector and public institutions. It also represents a key moment in the fight against illicit activities.
The Carabinieri Anti-Counterfeiting Monetary Command, the Department of Justice, and the Single Justice Fund (FUG) have worked with Young Platform. That is the main Italian cryptocurrency exchange to carry out this unique operation.
The process, completed in January 2023, is the result of a thorough investigation and legal coordination involving Eurojust and the support of Europol. 
The operation led to the arrest of 31 individuals, eight of whom are in pre-trial detention, on the order of the Preliminary Investigations Judge of the Naples Court. The charge is criminal association aimed at counterfeiting currency trafficking.
This operation is part of a broader investigation, started in July 2018, aimed at dismantling a criminal organization rooted in Naples and active internationally with branches in several European and non-European countries.
The investigations, conducted with the help of sophisticated computer technologies, have revealed the methods of distribution of counterfeit currency by a seller active on marketplaces since 2012. 
He used anonymous methods to handle cryptocurrency payments. After the arrests, large amounts of cryptocurrency were seized, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XRM).
The criminal network used the dark web and messaging platforms like Telegram to sell counterfeit banknotes in exchange for cryptocurrencies. The confiscated cryptocurrencies have been transferred to wallets managed by the Carabinieri Anti-counterfeiting Monetary Command. 
A new model of public-private collaboration
Subsequently, Young Platform was appointed as an auxiliary of the judicial police to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currency and transfer them to the Single Justice Fund (FUG). 
This public-private collaboration, involving law enforcement, judicial authorities, and a cryptocurrency exchange, is unprecedented in Italy. 
Young Platform aspires to be a model for other exchanges and companies in the sector, demonstrating how it is possible to collaborate proactively with authorities, even in a context of strict regulatory control.
The uniqueness of this operation lies not only in its positive outcome and pioneering nature, but also in demonstrating the effectiveness of collaboration between law enforcement and new financial technologies. 
Despite cryptocurrencies are often perceived as tools for illicit activities, their intrinsic transparency can prove to be an ally in the fight against crime. 
The blockchain, as we know, records every transaction permanently. Allowing authorities to track financial flows with an unprecedented level of detail.
The operation led to the arrest in flagrante of 31 people and the dismantling of an underground printing press in Arzano, in the province of Naples. Another 50 suspects have been referred to the Judicial Authority for crimes related to currency trafficking. 
48 searches were carried out abroad and 19 in Italy, highlighting the breadth and complexity of the operation.
Some statements regarding collaboration
Lorenzo Palombi, legal consultant for Young Platform and of counsel at GDP Lex Studio in Rome, stated:
“This operation underlines the positive role that financial technologies can have in society, creating an important precedent for future collaborations between the cryptocurrency sector and judicial authorities. Furthermore, it provides an operational model that can be used for similar initiatives in the future.”
Not by chance, this operational structure will be essential to standardize practices and ensure a coordinated and effective approach in the fight against financial crime.
The Cryptocurrencies Section of the Carabinieri Anti-Counterfeiting Monetary Command, which conducted this operation, demonstrates its ability to respond to the challenges posed by the digital evolution of financial markets. 
With specific tasks such as the analysis and contrast of the production and distribution of counterfeit currency, the Command plays a crucial role in the national and international security system, collaborating with community institutions and foreign police forces.
The goal is to establish a judicial practice that brings together public and private entities to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.
This approach aims to create an operational model that integrates financial and technological skills with law enforcement intelligence strategies.
Andrea Ferrero, CEO and co-founder of Young Platform, concludes:
“This collaboration between Young Platform and the Carabinieri Command demonstrates how new technologies can be an integral part of the fight against crime.”
Although cryptocurrencies can be used for illicit purposes, their potential to bring benefits to society is significant. 
Ferrero mentioned “The Chainalysis 2024 Crypto Crime Report”, in which the percentage of illicit volumes associated with cryptocurrencies in 2023 was 0.34%, showing a steady decline since 2019.

Two Bitcoin Metrics Flashing Bullish Signals for BTC, According to Bitfinex Analysts - The Daily Hodl


								Analysts with the crypto exchange Bitfinex say two key metrics are suddenly flashing bullish for Bitcoin (BTC).
In a new blog post, Bitfinex analysts say that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio shows the price of the top-performing crypto asset is likely going up.










MVRV is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to its realized capitalization, which is the value of all BTC at the price they were bought at and is used to assess whether the crypto asset is undervalued or overvalued. The analysts say the MVRV ratio suggests Bitcoin is now undervalued after falling since the start of April.
The second indicator the analysts say is signaling bullishness is Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) weighted funding rate, having turned positive after recent multiple negative dips.
Says the analysts.
“Currently, two important Bitcoin on-chain metrics signal a potentially advantageous buying opportunity. The Market Value to Realized Value measure, alongside the Open Interest weighted funding rate, hint at a potential entry point for investors… 
Several on-chain metrics, including the MVRV measure and the OI weighted funding rate, are currently indicating a potentially attractive entry point for Bitcoin investors.” 
Funding rates represent traders’ sentiment in the perpetual swaps market, and the amount is proportional to the number of contracts. Positive funding rates indicate that long position traders are dominant and are willing to pay funding to short traders.
Negative funding rates indicate that short position traders are dominant and are willing to pay long traders.
Bitcoin is trading for $59,207 at time of writing, up nearly 4% in the last 24 hours.

Ethereum Adds Over 260K Wallets in 2 Days: Will ETH Rally? - DailyCoin


        
Ethereum has recently witnessed its most significant two-day network growth in nearly two years.



The network growth comes despite recent price struggles.



Macroeconomic conditions and an ongoing SEC investigation continue to weigh on the asset’s price.
Despite recent ETH price struggles, things are not looking all bad for the Ethereum network. Recent data suggests that at the start of the week, the network saw its highest influx of new accounts in nearly two years.Could this network growth be the catalyst ETH needs?Ethereum Network Gains Over 260K New WalletsLike most crypto assets, ETH experienced a steep decline this week amid jitters over the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision, which was announced on Wednesday, May 1. Despite this market uncertainty, Santiment Feed data has revealed that thousands were still jumping into the Ethereum ecosystem at a record rate.
On Wednesday, Santiment Feed disclosed that over 260,000 new Ethereum wallets were created between April 28 and April 29, the highest two-day network growth since October 8 and October 9, 2022. While the reason for the recent network growth spike is unclear, over the weekend, the Ethereum community saw some excitement as the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) stirred hopes of spot Ethereum ETF approvals by listing Franklin Templeton’s planned offering on its website.Regardless of the catalyst, the network growth metric has sparked optimism amongst some Ethereum users. This optimism comes as network growth is typically bullish for underlying crypto assets. Still, uncertainties remain.Overarching ConcernsSignificant growth in the number of addresses in a network is typically viewed as a sign of strong network fundamentals, highlighting a potential for increased capital inflows. 
However, the impact of this network growth is not always immediately reflected in price, particularly when investors have overarching concerns. At present, these concerns for Ethereum include continued high interest rates in the U.S. and the SEC’s unclear position on the asset’s classification.At the time of writing, ETH continues to trade below the psychologically important $3,000 price level at $2,991, per CoinMarketCap data.On the Flipside 
Despite recent price struggles, Ethereum is still up over 30% year-to-date (YTD) from an opening price of around $2,282.
Why This MattersEthereum is the second largest crypto asset in terms of market capitalization. While the recent network growth may not translate to immediate price gains, it suggests continued interest in the ecosystem.Read this for more on ETH:SEC to OK Leveraged ETH ETFs… While Probing Security Status?See how Polygon (MATIC) is reacting to the recent market downturn:Polygon (MATIC) Plunges in BTC-Led Flush: Can It Hold Support?

Bitcoin Institutionals Behind $57,000 Crash? Data Says So


								Data shows the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium has been negative for a while now, a sign that institutional selling has been occurring behind the scenes.
Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Turned Quite Negative Recently
As pointed out by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has been negative for seven straight days.
The “Coinbase Premium Gap” is an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the BTC prices listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair). When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is greater than on Binance right now. Such a trend implies the buying pressure is higher (or alternatively, the selling pressure is lower) on the former than the latter.

On the other hand, the indicator being red suggests the presence of higher selling pressure on the Coinbase platform, which has pushed the price of the asset lower on it.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past year:

The price of the asset appears to have been quite negative in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has been negative for the past week or so, implying that the selling pressure on Coinbase has been higher than on Binance.
Recently, the indicator has assumed some especially sharp negative values, which have coincided with the recent crash that the cryptocurrency has observed. This could suggest that selling on the platform may be behind the crash.
This has actually been the pattern observed in 2024 so far, as the asset’s price has seemed to be sensitive to changes in the metric. When the rally was ongoing earlier, the indicator had been at highly positive levels, but this buying seems to have ended now.
Coinbase is popularly known to be used by the American institutional entities, while Binance has a more global userbase. As such, the indicator’s value reflects how the behavior of the US-based institutional traders differs from that of the global investors.
Since the Bitcoin price has been reacting to movements in the Coinbase Premium Gap this year, it would appear that these whales have been driving the price action.

The latest red values of the indicator would imply that these investors have been participating in a selloff recently. As long as this streak of negative levels continues, it’s possible that Bitcoin will continue to observe bearish price action.
A flip towards the positive, on the other hand, would suggest at least sideways movement around the current levels, if not outright a switch towards bullish momentum. It now remains to be seen what moves the Coinbase users will make in the coming days.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $58,600, down over 7% in the last seven days.

Analysts have different opinions regarding Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market. il Capo said that BTC should receive liquidity between $57,000 and $59,000. Now he has announced that he prefers to wait for more signs of where the market will go.

Pantera invests in TON with high expectations for Telegram’s future

Pantera Capital has invested an undisclosed amount in The Open Network (TON). It is the crypto-focused venture capital firm’s “latest” investment in TON and motivated by its connection to the Telegram messaging service, the company said.Telegram’s decision in April to incorporate TON gives TON “potential to become one of the largest crypto networks,” Pantera said in a long and enthusiastic blog post on its website. Telegram, with its 900 million monthly users and 36.7 million monthly downloads, “is well positioned to bring crypto to the world because of its shared Web3 ethos.” In a laundry list of TON’s virtues, Pantera said the architecture of the TON blockchain provides performance and scalability that compares favorably with leading blockchains, and its wallet offers high utility with a simple interface. A comparison of scalability among major blockchains. Source: Pantera CapitalPantera also praised the mini-apps TON enables on Telegram:“Earlier this year, we observed how memecoin trading tools like BonkBot generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue through Telegram’s user interface. TON-based applications, such as StormTrade, now enable users to trade perpetuals, cryptocurrencies, stocks, and equities using the same interface.” Furthermore, Telegram is offering new opportunities for monetization, such as ad revenue sharing and tradable customized usernames, virtual phone numbers and emojis.Related: Tether issued on TON blockchain at a ‘great start,’ says CEO — Now at $60MThe Telegram-TON linkup was a notable achievement, Pantera noted. TON was originally designed to integrate with Telegram, but its initial attempt was foiled by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Telegram was able to reunite TON after the network was relaunched by independent developers, making it the only major messaging platform to incorporate Web3.

Coinbase Ranked As Top Spot Crypto Exchange in CCData's Latest Exchange Benchmark | Cryptoglobe


                                
CCData, a leading provider of digital asset market data and analysis, has recently released the latest edition (April 2024) of its highly anticipated Exchange Benchmark report. This comprehensive study, which has become an industry standard for evaluating the risk associated with cryptocurrency exchanges, offers valuable insights into the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.



The Exchange Benchmark, first launched in 2019, has undergone significant expansions and enhancements to its methodology, now encompassing over 100 exchanges across 8 key categories, including Security, Legal/Regulation, KYC/Transaction Risk, Team/Exchange, Data Provision, Asset Quality/Diversity, Market Quality, and Transparency. The report covers both centralized exchanges (spot and derivatives) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), with the latter being assessed based on a separate set of metrics tailored to their unique characteristics (Security, Community, Transparency, Governance, Market Quality, User Experience, and Incentives).



One of the key highlights from the April 2024 report is the continued dominance of Coinbase, which has maintained its top ranking for the second consecutive Exchange Benchmark. Coinbase’s strong performance can be attributed to its high scores in the Legal/Regulation and Security sections, which have been revamped to ensure the highest level of risk mitigation and accountability.



Out of the 98 spot exchanges evaluated, 17 achieved Top-Tier status (BB+ or higher), with Coinbase and Bitstamp being the only exchanges to score above 80 points. Kraken and Bybit also impressed, obtaining AA rankings with scores above 75. The report cites improved Market Quality, new VASP licenses, and the increased adoption of off-exchange settlement offerings as major drivers behind these top-tier scores.



In the derivatives space, 10 out of 27 exchanges reached Top-Tier status, with OKX and Bybit leading the pack with AA grades and scores of 82.5 and 81.2, respectively. Both exchanges scored full marks in the Derivatives Market Quality category, alongside Binance, which was thresholded due to a major negative event resulting from their recent CFTC settlement.



The April 2024 report also highlighted a significant increase in due diligence questionnaire submissions, with nearly 50% of Top-Tier exchanges across spot and derivatives markets providing completed DDQs. This trend reflects a growing commitment to transparency among leading exchanges and a desire to align with the increasingly robust Exchange Benchmark methodology.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

According to data from VASPnet, 68 out of 103 exchanges hold a VASP License, while 26 are registered as a Money Service Business. Notably, over 95% of Top-Tier exchanges are regulated, compared to only 60% of Lower-Tier exchanges.



The report also sheds light on the rising popularity of Off-Exchange Settlement solutions, which help mitigate counterparty risk by allowing assets to be mirrored on exchanges and traded natively while user funds are held in cold storage with regulated custodians. A total of 18 exchanges now offer access to this service, with 9 of them achieving Top-Tier status.



Despite the tougher criteria introduced in the latest benchmark, the overall performance of exchanges has improved, with the dominant grade remaining a B in the last two iterations. However, the number of AA-grade exchanges has declined by 43% since the last benchmark, reflecting the superior performance of leading exchanges.



Top-Tier centralized exchanges experienced a remarkable 775% surge in monthly volume, from ~$250bn in Oct-23 to ~$2.17tn in Apr-24, significantly outpacing the 313% increase seen among Lower-Tier exchanges. This trend highlights the market’s growing demand for robust risk mitigation and optimal market liquidity.



The report also underscores the importance of assessing counterparty risk factors, given the consistent uptrend in centralized exchange volumes, which grew by 345% since the last Benchmark, reaching an all-time high monthly volume of over $3tn by the end of March.



In terms of market quality, the report found that AA and A ranked exchanges account for 78% of the Daily Average Volumes across ranked exchanges during the collection period, while Top-Tier exchanges make up over 85% overall. This finding suggests that traders and investors prioritize volume and liquidity, especially when coupled with high regulatory compliance, robust infrastructure, and optimal market quality.



Finally, the report delves into the critical factors of spread and top-of-book liquidity, identifying Binance and OKX as the best-performing exchanges in terms of maintaining tight spreads and deep liquidity across key trading pairs.

Mom Sexualizes Herself on Livestream for Son’s Meme Coin-Then Ghosts - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsA kid and his mom begged viewers on their livestream to invest in their meme coin LIVEMOM while she bounced her boobs on camera.Then things got weird.The Kick stream, titled “live with mom,” launched early this morning and lasted just under an hour of the pair urging viewers to hit market cap milestones. If and when the market cap grew, the boy would do something degrading, like eating dog food, or his mom would sexualize herself, like doing 15 squats in front of the camera. And the ploy worked—at least, for a while.After the pair abruptly ended the livestream and deleted the associated social media accounts, the price of the token crashed, with early LIVEMOM buyers claiming the duo had rugged. Yet, somehow, the price of the token is now going up, as degen traders gravitate toward the LIVEMOM “lore.”“Do you wanna see him pour milk over these 36DDs?” the woman in the video, who claimed to be the boy’s mother, said to the livestream, bouncing her breasts at the camera. “[My son] actually suckled on these. Now he’s going to get to pour milk on them.” Incestuous degeneracy apparently goes viral quickly. The stream peaked at around 1,500 viewers within minutes. In turn, the token began to pump as eggs were cracked on the kid’s head, and the family begged viewers to pump the coin.Messages like “One nipple at 300K, deal?” flooded the chat. “Dudes 13 and pimping out his mom,” another said while others begged, “TAKE IT OFF PLS.”According to a viewer of the livestream, a pseudonymous trader who goes by “Doonhamer,” the token’s price directly correlated with what the mom was doing. If she went off screen, the token would drop. If she shook her boobs, the token would pump.“We were baffled, dude, we couldn’t believe it. This prepubescent, but also could have been of age, kid with his mom enticing viewers to buy a coin with his mom shaking the assets, the marketing,” pseudonymous viewer Shamrock told Decrypt. “I was laughing my ass off, until he rugged.”To be clear, we don’t know if the pair in the video are really mother and son, only that they portrayed themselves this way. It’s also possible that the male in the video is of age, though appears to be quite young. It’s also unclear if the pair cashed out and caused the price of the token to crash, but deleting social media accounts and ghosting your “investors” are the hallmarks of a cryptocurrency rug pull—a type of scam that is all too common in the space.When the token touched the $300,000 market cap milestone—which would have resulted in the mom doing 15 squats—the kid said that his phone ran out of battery. Viewers of the stream didn’t buy it. “Oh my phone died, damn damn damn,” the kid said, according to livestream viewers who spoke with Decrypt, suggesting his phone was the webcam, “We’ll run it back tomorrow.”At this same time, the token crashed from $310,000 market cap down to $129,000 in less than five minutes. Half an hour later, the stream came back on with a new token LIVEMOM2. Egg had been washed out of the kid's hair and the mom had changed her top. But this 15 minute stream didn’t see as much success, instantly falling to zero after reaching a $100,000 market cap.Since then, the project’s Kick and Twitter account have both been taken down. The duo has gone dark, yet to be heard from again.Since the initial crash, early buyers of the LIVEMOM token have reclaimed the project, in a sort of “community takeover,” by embracing the livestream as lore. At the time of writing, investors have pumped the token up to a $835,000 market cap with nearly 200 people in a Telegram voice chat discussing the chaos.DisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Altseason Alert: Bitcoin Dominance Crumbles, Altcoins Primed - DailyCoin


        
Crypto markets are caught in an accumulation period at present.



This week saw markets sell-off, with Bitcoin sinking to a new local price bottom.



A strong bounce in altcoins adds to calls of an incoming altseason.
Bitcoin tumbled to a nine-week low this week following the Fed’s decision to leave rates unchanged. Although the leading cryptocurrency has since made a muted recovery, growing 1.4% over the last 24 hours, altcoins have largely outperformed. A handful of the top 100 tokens, including PEPE, Wormhole, and Arweave, posted double-digit gains.Amidst this backdrop, Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) plummeted on Wednesday, which, coupled with altcoin overperformance, points to a potential altseason in the making.Bitcoin Dominance Tops OutBTC.D took a significant dip on Wednesday, falling from 54.87% to 53.91%, marking a four-week low while adding to calls of an incoming altseason.   BTC.D daily chart per Trading ViewBitcoin’s crypto market dominance has been trending lower since recording a year-to-date high of 57% on April 13. This trend has caught the attention of YouTuber Scott Melker, who believed this may have been the local top for Bitcoin Dominance.
Trader “Mikybull 🐂 Crypto” noted that Wednesday’s dip in BTC.D broke below a rising wedge pattern, and combined with bearish divergence on the Relative Strength Index, led him to conclude the move is the start of a downtrend that will culminate in an “explosive altseason.”However, while altcoins appear to be outperforming Bitcoin, that in itself is not a confirmation of altseason.Altseason On?There is no definitive agreed-upon definition of altseason. Still, these periods are typically characterized by outsized gains in altcoins relative to both Bitcoin and fiat currencies like the US dollar. Altseasons represent a shift in investor sentiment, as the dynamic involves capital flows out of Bitcoin into altcoin projects, reflecting a heightened appetite for risk among crypto investors.
A willingness to embrace higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities underscores the optimism and bullish sentiment that typically pervades the market during an altseason.Wednesday’s sell-off in crypto markets was met with a strong bounce in altcoins, as denoted by the long bottom wick on the daily May 1 candle of the total crypto market cap, excluding the BTC chart. This indicated that investors were quick to accumulate altcoins at discounted prices.Total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin per Trading ViewHowever, bears rejected a break above $1 trillion on Wednesday and again on Thursday, suggesting that altseason is not yet here. On the Flipside
There are countless incidents of Bitcoin Dominance waning, yet no altseason arrives.



Altcoins benefit from outsized percentage gains (and losses) due to having smaller market caps.

Bitcoin Market In Distribution: Are We Nearing A Bottom? - Benzinga

Since Bitcoin’s BTC/USD March all-time high of $73,000, the market has transitioned into a phase of widespread net distribution, with investors cashing in on profits.What Happened: In their latest report, Glassnode analyzes the nuances of investor behavior to identify potential turning points.Euphoria Phase with a Cool-OffWhile the Net Unrealized Profit & Loss (NUPL) metric confirms the ongoing Euphoria phase of the bull market, it has cooled down significantly since the correction began. This indicates a shift in sentiment compared to the rapid price appreciation seen earlier.Short-Term Holders Driving the MarketAnalyzing the breakdown of sell-side pressure reveals that short-term holders (those who recently acquired Bitcoin) are currently the most active sellers. Understanding their cost basis and spending patterns can offer insights into potential market bottoms.Identifying Potential Local BottomsGlassnode’s research introduces a framework for identifying potential local bottoms based on the behavior of short-term holders. Here are the key takeaways:
1w-1m Cost Basis: This metric tracks the average cost of Bitcoin for investors who bought within the last 1-4 weeks. It acts as a sensitive indicator of their selling pressure.



MVRV Ratio: This ratio measures the spot price against the 1w-1m cost basis, indicating how much below their average price recent buyers are willing to sell. During corrections, it typically falls within the 0.9-1 range.



Realized Loss: This metric measures the total USD value of Bitcoin sold at a loss by the 1w-1m holder cohort. Spikes in realized loss often coincide with market bottoms, as panicked selling intensifies. 
Also Read: BlackRock Anticipates Renewed Institutional Interest In Bitcoin Spot ETFsCurrent Market Conditions and Potential Bottom FormationAt the time of writing, the 1w-1m cost basis sits at $66.7k, while the MVRV ratio falls within the typical correction range. Additionally, realized loss for this group has surpassed the 90-day standard deviation threshold, indicating significant selling pressure.These factors suggest that the market might be hammering out a local bottom formation around the $60k-$66.7k range. However, a sustained break below the MVRV threshold could trigger further selling and establish a new equilibrium.This analysis by Glassnode provides valuable insights into the current state of the Bitcoin market. While distribution is the dominant trend, short-term holder behavior offers clues for identifying potential turning points and navigating market corrections.Looking Ahead: Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets EventEvents like Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 19 provide crucial platforms for industry leaders and analysts to discuss these evolving market dynamics and collaborate on navigating the complexities of the digital asset ecosystem.Read Next: Jack Dorsey’s Block Under Examination From Authorities Over Alleged Sanctions ViolationsThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

The move for an ‘undervalued’ bitcoin miner? Perhaps selling the company. - Blockworks


Stronghold Digital Mining executives want you to know they’re not happy about the company’s stock price.
As a result, they are considering selling the bitcoin miner’s assets. Or the company outright.
Such a sale could be among the first deals after the April 19 Bitcoin halving — when per-block mining rewards were reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Various industry watchers said they expected mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity to pick up following the event.

It has 130 megawatts (MW) of energized data center capacity with an installed hash rate of 4.1 exahash per second. Stronghold also owns 750 or so acres of land, as well as the transmission lines that connect its assets to the PJM grid.
Stronghold’s current capacity could expand to more than 400 MW, with a potential focus on supporting the growing segments of AI and machine learning, Stronghold Greg Beard said on the call.
“We own a portfolio of hard assets where every known available comparable valuation is significantly in excess of the public market price of Stronghold today,” Beard noted. “Recognizing this dislocation, we have initiated a process to do something about it.”
The company has hired financial and legal advisors as part of a “formal strategic review process,” the company said in a Thursday news release.
Stronghold is considering “the sale of all or part of the company,” or another transaction that involves some or all of its assets, it added in a statement.
The company’s stock price was $3.16 at 12 pm ET — down 52% year to date.
This price plummet so far this year is more than most of the mining industry’s largest public competitors. Bitcoin mining behemoths Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Hut 8 for example, have seen share prices drop between 28% and 35% so far this year. 
Core Scientific stock is down just 5%, while CleanSpark is up 44% from the start of 2024.

Stronghold tallied net income of $5.8 million during the first quarter, executives said Thursday. It held $8 million in combined cash and bitcoin on its balance sheet, as of April 30, including 26 BTC.
Beard said Stronghold trades at more than a 70% discount on an enterprise value to hash rate capacity basis.
“While factors such as scale and leverage could explain a modest discount, trading at a fraction of our peers’ multiple continues to be hard for us to understand,” he added.
The Stronghold CEO previously told Blockworks that selling the company, or its assets, to an interested industry peer would be “something to consider.” 
“Generally speaking, companies that are misunderstood by the public market that have actual attributes and value that can be valued by other public companies…tend to be realized in that way,” Beard said last month.

Joe Flynn, an analyst at Compass Point Research and Trading, wrote in an April 9 research note that Stronghold’s debt and limited access to capital markets put it in a tough position. 
It could potentially reduce expenses and “high overhead” as a small public company by selling its “valuable” infrastructure and access to power, he added.
The Stronghold executives said there is no timetable for when its strategic review process will be complete. 
They then abruptly ended Thursday’s earnings call.
Beard said: “Given the sensitivity of the process that we’ve undertaken, we are not going to have a Q&A session today.”

Any optimism for a string of interest rate reductions in 2024 has quickly faded as the economy and inflation show unexpected resilience.U.S. shares were poised for an upward trajectory, with the futures for the S&P 500 showing a strong surge of 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures indicating a 0.4% increase.Markets all over the world react to Fed ratesEuropean markets started the day with a mix of gains and losses, as investors braced themselves for a flurry of corporate earnings announcements.

The Fed added that:In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent.

The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
 FedMarkets in AsiaThe Japanese yen experienced a significant surge of up to 2% during the early hours of Asia on Thursday. This surge was fueled by speculation surrounding the possibility of Japanese authorities engaging in another round of yen-buying intervention. Additionally, the weakening of the U.S. dollar following the Federal Reserve meeting also contributed to this surge. Afterwards, the yen changed direction and nullified its earlier gains. The dollar had risen to 155.44 yen, compared to its previous rate of 154.91 yen.The Kospi in South Korea experienced a 0.3% decline, settling at 2,683.65.

This action would help alleviate the strain on the economy and stabilize investment prices.The price of bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a modest rebound in the minutes following the news, although it continues to face downward pressure.

89% of Holders of Gary Gensler’s Praised Token in Loss, Just 8% See Profits - Coin Edition


							

Algorand holders face significant losses, with a staggering 89% underwater.



Only 8% of investors in ALGO are currently in profit at its price of $0.1818.



Gary Gensler previously praised Algorand, helping the asset reach $3.56 ATH.




As the crypto market experiences a downturn, crypto investors feel the heat, particularly those holding Algorand (ALGO), Gary Gensler’s praised project. Data from the analytics platform IntoTheBlock shows that 89% of ALGO holders are at a loss. These investors are “out of the money,” meaning the overwhelming majority of ALGO investors hold the asset below the price they first bought them. 



ALGO trades at $0.1818 at press time, with a 5% gain in the last 24 hours. At this market value, only 8% of Algorand holders are profitable. In parallel, 3% are at break even, neither bearish making profit or gains.

Remarkably, among the cryptocurrencies monitored by IntoTheBlock, ALGO stands out as having the highest percentage of holders in a loss position.



Furthermore, IntoTheBlock statistics indicated that at least 83% of these Algorand investors are long-term investors holding the asset for more than a year. Only 15% joined the ALGO market within the last year. Meanwhile, 2% of the holder spectrum accounts for those who bought ALGO within the last 30 days.



Silvio Micali, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor, founded Algorand in 2017. This blockchain project garnered praise from the now infamous U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, Gary Gensler. 









This was during Gensler’s tenure teaching at the MIT Sloan School of Management in 2018 and 2019. Specifically, during a 2019 presentation, Gensler remarked that Algorand is “a great technology that has a performance with which you could create Uber on top of it.”



This endorsement gained more significance after Gensler assumed the role of SEC Chair in 2021. However, when the SEC filed a lawsuit against the crypto trading platform Bittrex last April, it classified ALGO as a security. 



Despite initial optimism and endorsements, Algorand has struggled to keep pace with its peers in recent years. Three months after Gensler’s 2019 presentation, ALGO surged to an all-time high of $3.56. However, selling at around $0.1818, the asset reflects a staggering 94% drop in value since then.
