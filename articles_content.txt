Financial system ‘outdated’ but crypto is no fix either: US swing voters

The majority of Americans in swing states say the financial system is “outdated” but agree crypto may not be the solution either, a survey reveals.The study, conducted by the Digital Currency Group and The Harris Group, surveyed 1,201 people in six “swing states” — a term given to states that could reasonably be won by either the Democratic or Republican parties in a state election. Cointelegraph’s earlier reporting found that over 90% of these respondents plan on voting in the upcoming U.S. election and that a politician’s crypto stance could play a key role in their choices.However, while 70% of the surveyed voters agreed that the current financial system is “outdated” and 74% say the system is in need of an “overhaul” only a third of respondents agreed crypto could solve this problem, the May 7 report found.Four out of five participants said the current financial system favors the elites over regular people, but nearly 75% of respondents said crypto isn’t more equitable than the current system either.Only 41% of swing voters agree that crypto represents a new way toward financial security and prosperity, while 35% believe crypto is the future of transacting.Participants’ view on the current financial system and whether crypto  can solve those problems.

Fundstrat’s Tom Lee Doubles Down on Big Bitcoin Prediction, Says Risk-Reward for Stock Market Still Pretty Good - The Daily Hodl


								The chief executive of market insights platform Fundstrat is reiterating that Bitcoin (BTC) will still post massive gains this year despite its choppy price action in the last six weeks.
In a new CNBC interview, Tom Lee says Bitcoin’s bull market cycle is far from over.










According to Lee, Bitcoin and other asset classes have not yet agreed that the Fed is shifting to a looser monetary policy.
“Bitcoin is still early in an upcycle. So the idea that it can get to $150,000 this year is still within our base case… I think it does help that the Fed is reiterating that its view on inflation and its being relatively dovish is more dovish than where the market is. So I think that’s the process of why markets are recovering.” 
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $62,508, down 1.31% in the past day.
Looking at the stock market, Lee sees more publicly listed companies printing solid earnings growth this quarter. He also highlights that market conditions look bullish with trillions of dollars still waiting on the sidelines.
“To us, earnings growth is accelerating. Q1 earnings are up 7%, but three groups are down 20%: energy, healthcare, and materials. Energy and healthcare flip to positive next quarter so earnings growth hits 11%.
We know there’s a lot of pent-up demand. Capital spending is picking up, and the ISMs are turning up and there’s $6 trillion in cash on the sidelines and people have been cautious for more than two years now.
I think the risk-reward is still pretty good.”

Why Polygon and MATIC's loss is LINK's gain after it surges 10% - AMBCrypto



Chainlink and MATIC on-chain metrics were compared, and investors have a clear favorite.
This could be an early sign of a better price performance in the coming months for one of them.

Chainlink [LINK] has gained just over 10% in the past week. Whales continued to accumulate the token, which was a positive sign for long-term investors.
Exchange flow was negative as well, as IntoTheBlock pointed out on X (formerly Twitter).
The oracle network token is closely rivaled by the Layer 2 scaling solution Polygon [MATIC] in terms of market capitalization. They stand at 16th and 18th on the list of the largest cryptos, respectively.
How do their on-chain metrics measure against one another?

The exchange reserve metric tracks how much of a token is on centralized exchanges. When the metric spikes higher, it indicates that a large amount of the tokens have entered exchanges, likely for selling.
Conversely, tokens moving off exchanges indicates accumulation was underway. The Chainlink exchange reserve chart above noted that a downtrend in the metric has been present since mid-February.

On the other hand, MATIC has slowly trended higher since mid-February. It tumbled downward from the 11th to the 14th of April, but quickly pushed higher.
This showed that, overall, holders might lack faith in the token and are steadily selling.
This metric is just one factor amongst many that deals with market-wide sentiment and the accumulation or distribution of an asset.
Hence, its findings can not be taken by themselves to draw conclusions about the next price trends.
Sentiment comparison also hands LINK the advantage

AMBCrypto analyzed data from Santiment to see if LINK and MATIC had positive market participant sentiment. The Weighted Sentiment of LINK was negative, and has been that way for the past ten days.
The rally from $13.2 to $15.6 in the latter half of April saw the social engagement jump skyward. It outmatched the March highs and nearly set new highs for 2024 on the 19th of April.
However, the Social Volume has been trending lower over the past six weeks.


Realistic or not, here’s LINK’s market cap in BTC’s terms

It was a similar story in terms of volume for MATIC. Here, too, the social volume has been in decline since the second week of March. However, the difference was that the weighted sentiment was primarily negative.
It only had a handful of days above zero, and even then the sentiment was weak. The accumulation and social media trends indicate that LINK prices would likely perform better than MATIC in the coming weeks.

LocalMonero and AgoraDesk Announces Closure: Report


							

The team behind LocalMonero and AgoraDesk announces the platform’s closure.



The platforms cite internal and external factors as the driving forces behind the closure.



The post states that the Monera trade will be closed on May 14, and the firms will see their complete shutdown in November.




In a recent revelation, the team behind the peer-to-peer trading platforms LocalMonero and AgoraDesk announced the firms’ closure. As per the official notice, the platforms are being shut down due to a “combination of internal and external factors.”



The team declared that the platforms will stop facilitating the trade of the privacy-focused Monero token on May 14. In addition, both platforms have disabled new signups and advertisements on Monero.



AgoraDesk took to X on May 8 to announce the firm’s “difficult decision to close our [their] platform.” The X post stated, “The winding-down process begins today and finishes six months from now.”







The post added that the platforms would be closed after 6 months, exactly on November 7, 2024, urging users to reclaim their funds prior to the date. The platforms added that the funds that aren’t withdrawn will be considered abandoned or fortified.









Further, the team appreciated their users’ love and support for the past 7 years. They added their trust in Monero’s future, stating,




“The Monero ecosystem has matured a lot over these years, and with the imminent launch of Haveno and other DEXs like Serai, atomic swaps, the coming addition of FCMP as well as the continuing and rapidly accelerating development of the Monero protocol, we’re confident that Monero’s future is bright, with or without our platform.”




These platforms’ shutdown has caused a stir in the community as it pose a question on the reliability of the Monero coin. Recently, Binance delisted Monero, leading to a significant depreciation of the privacy token.



As of press time, Monero (XMR) is trading at $129.13, marking a slight decline of 1.15% in the last 24 hours. However, XMR has seen a notable surge of 6% in one week despite a 2.6% monthly dip.

Spot The Difference In YTD Returns? Why Ethereum Is Trailing Bitcoin In 2024 - Benzinga

Ethereum ETH/USD has underperformed relative to Bitcoin BTC/USD in the ongoing cycle, with the listing of Bitcoin spot ETFs proving to be the difference. What Happened:  Bitcoin broke past its all-time high last month, spurred by significant demand for new investment vehicles that track its spot price. The King Coin was up 47% on a year-to-date basis, according to Benzinga Pro.However, this pattern did not hold for Ethereum, which failed to go anyway near its 2021 peak this cycle. Its year-to-date gains have been comparatively mild at 32%. According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin's Short-Term Holders Realized Cap was almost on par with the last bull run peak. On the other hand, Ethereum's STH-Realized Cap was less than half of the previous cycle. Put simply, short-term holders, or newer market entrants, have shown far greater interest in Bitcoin, while new capital inflows into Ethereum have been lackluster. Why It Matters: The launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs made investing in cryptocurrencies easier, providing greater access to newer market participants, Glassnode noted. Ethereum, on the other hand, was still in a wait-and-watch mode with a decision regarding its spot ETFs due to come later this month. British multinational bank Standard Chartered which had initially forecasted approval by May, reversed its stance last month, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas too echoed the pessimistic statement last monthEthereum's status has become the major sticking point, with the SEC allegedly launching a covert operation to brand the cryptocurrency as a security.If Ethereum is officially declared a security, it could adversely impact sentiment and investments around the coin, resulting in a potential price crash. Price Action: Ethereum was exchanging hands at $3,015.99 at the time of writing, dropping by 1.56% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Photo by Kanchanara on UnsplashRead Next: Pro-Bitcoin President Javier Milei’s Argentina Introduces 10,000-Peso Notes As It Combats Hyperinflation, Currency Collapse

Privacy Coins suffer another blow as LocalMonero closes

The stringent privacy-focused cryptocurrency crackdown is still unfolding and the latest victim  to be picked up is the localMonero which is  peer-to-peer trading platform for the Monero privacy coin that will ceasing operations. This gives rise the recent effort targetting of privacy coins and protocols.LocalMonero abrupt closureOn May 7th, the company that facilitates Monero transactions, LocalMonero, declared that their registration of new users and offer of advertising landing sites were disabled immediately. The Crypto exchange will formally stop providing the channel for trading the crypto-asset spot and margin pairs of the privacy-focused crypto-asset on May 14. Although the Company cites “the convergence of internal and external factors,” it neglects to mention the precise rationale behind its choice of fully closing the operation.According to LocalMonero, everyone should get funds from their accounts by November 7, when the website is shutting down. Any balance of these funds left in wallets on the established date may be considered forsaken.The LocalMonero project hit the world in 2017 as an alternative platform of LocalBitcoins (and consequently a trademark of Monero). Now that the world has seen Monero go through some growing phases, LocalMonero aims to capture a share of the crypto trading platform market. The team stressed a bullish outlook on Monero by mentioning the next milestones, like Havnoo and Serai DEXes launches. They also said that privacy updates, earlier known as Membership Proofs (FCMPs), give them confidence that Monero’s future is bright.However, this optimism does not eclipse the view of some as another avenue to make privacy coins and protocols impossible with Kraken’s decision to terminate Monero and others for customers in Ireland and Belgium in April.The future of privacy coinsThere are also worries that the entire privacy-centered digital currencies and services industry is disappearing fast. According to Seth for Privacy, a privacy enthusiast and a famous privacy advocate, “LocalMonero’s shutdown is a very sad day as the project managed to remain anonymous for almost five years.” Such a service, he underscored, played a crucial role in the no-KYC  Monero ecosystem. Seth For Privacy presaged that the move could be a symptom of the ongoing “all-out anti-privacy crypto war.”The latest period, however, has seen the world’s financial watchdogs perched on an eagle’s view of privacy coins. In April, the founders of crypto blender Samourai Wallet faced charges of money laundering. More privacy services like Wasabi CoinJoin and Trezor Coinjoin also met the same fate as their counterparts, and their founders were also forced to shut down due to the increasing pressure.As the regulatory sphere looks to find its way, the future of privacy coins with their fungible ecosystem looks unsure. For those in favor of privacy through cryptocurrency, and LocalMonero in particular, the closure of its website is an alert to the mind of the existing problems between privacy advocates and regulatory organizations.

                        LocalMonero, a peer-to-peer trading platform for the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero, has decided to shut down its services with immediate effect. In a Tuesday announcement, the exchange informed its users that new signups and advertisement postings for Monero trades would be disabled immediately. Furthermore, starting from May 14, the platform will no longer support trading of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency. LocalMonero Cites Internal and External Factors
While the company cited a combination of internal and external factors for its decision, it did not provide specific details regarding the reasons behind the closure.“After almost 7 years of operation, due to a combination of internal and external factors, we have made the difficult decision to close our platform,” the company said. Additionally, LocalMonero stated that on November 7, the website would be taken down completely. It urged users to reclaim any funds from their wallets before that date to avoid potential loss, as unclaimed funds might be considered abandoned.Established in 2017 as the Monero equivalent of LocalBitcoins, LocalMonero acknowledged the growth and maturation of the Monero ecosystem over the years. The platform’s team expressed confidence in Monero’s future, pointing to the imminent launch of decentralized exchanges such as Haveno and Serai, as well as the recently announced privacy update called Full-Chain Membership Proofs (FCMPs). They believe that Monero will continue to thrive, with or without their platform.The closure of LocalMonero is perceived by some as another blow to privacy coins and protocols, following Kraken’s termination of support for Monero in April for customers based in Ireland and Belgium, as well as recent legal action against Tornado Cash.Privacy advocate “Seth For Privacy” expressed sadness about the closure, highlighting LocalMonero’s significance as a cornerstone of the no-KYC Monero ecosystem. He noted that there is currently no direct fiat-to-XMR alternative available, emphasizing the platform’s importance to the Monero community. While LocalMonero did not provide a specific reason for its closure, users have been left to speculate about the underlying causes.Privacy Coins and Services Under Scrutiny
The recent months have witnessed increased scrutiny from global finance regulators targeting privacy coins and services. In April, the co-founders of Samourai Wallet, a cryptocurrency mixer, were arrested on charges of money laundering brought by the U.S. Justice Department and other agencies. Samourai Wallet CEO Keonne Rodriguez and chief technology officer William Hill are facing charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.Other privacy services such as Wasabi CoinJoin and Trezor Coinjoin have also shuttered recently as the crackdown on privacy intensified.The U.S. government has also been cracking down on crypto-mixing services. As reported, the US Treasury has added Tornado Cash, a prominent crypto mixer, to its Specially Designated Nationals list, effectively banning Americans from using this mixer. In September 2023, Roman Storm, co-founder of the cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash, pleaded not guilty to all charges and was released on a $2 million bond shortly after his arrest. He currently faces travel restrictions, confining him to certain regions of New York, New Jersey, Washington, and California.Likewise, the founder of Bitcoin Fog, a $400 million crypto-mixing service, was convicted of money laundering.

Web3 and Macron: Unstoppable Domains collaborates with Women in Tech

Web3 news: Unstoppable Domains has announced a partnership with the renowned organization Women in Tech on the occasion of their Global Summit, which is held under the patronage of President Emmanuel Macron.  
During the Women in Tech Global Summit 2024, the world’s first web3 domain dedicated to women will be launched.
This new top-level domain will provide a distinctive identity to the brand, foster a vibrant online community, and support educational initiatives related to blockchain and artificial intelligence for this year’s global summit in Paris.
Let’s see below all the details. 

Unstoppable Domains: web3 for women at the Global Summit of Women in Tech, Macron’s collaboration
As anticipated, the Women in Tech Global Summit, an annual event dedicated to promoting the future of women in innovation, will have for the first time its own top-level domain (TLD) Web3.
This new TLD will allow to create a digital community for participants and to develop platforms for initiatives in support of future leaders in the technology sector.
All participants of the Summit, which was held in Paris on May 6 and 7 this year, will be able to access the event community through their digital identities “Name.WITG”. 
This will allow them to network and access educational resources, including those related to blockchain and artificial intelligence. 
Furthermore, the TLD .WITG will allow Women in Tech to strengthen its global brand, enabling its community to become ambassadors on social media and in Web3 communities. 
This is thanks to a branded domain extension, similar to email signatures like “Sent from my iPhone”.
The new TLD .WITG will be provided by Unstoppable Domains (UD), a leader in the domain name and Web3 digital identity sector. 
Unstoppable Domains has already collaborated with other major tech events, such as SXSW, helping make Austin, Texas the first city to use a Web3 domain based on blockchain.
Women in Tech: empowering women in the technology sector
Sandy Carter, COO of Unstoppable Domains, stated the following: 
“The increase in deepfakes and cyber threats has made digital identity a hot topic in the technological and political fields, but Web3 domains are not only used to counter malicious behaviors. As we will demonstrate at the Women in Tech Global Summit, the potential of Web3 lies in its ability to build and promote new communities, marking a new era in how organizations interact with their audience. We look forward to presenting the future of engagement to participants at WIT 2024.”
This initiative represents an important milestone for Women in Tech Global, which becomes the first global women’s organization to implement its own naming service. 
Confirming its commitment to innovation and leadership in the technology sector. The .WITG TLD has been designed to create a strong sense of community among women in the technology sector. Thus fostering networking opportunities, mentorship, and collaboration. 
The goal is to provide women with the necessary tools to succeed and grow in the digital space. Showing that empowerment through technology is more than just a slogan: it is a real path of personal and professional growth.
Ayumi Moore Aoki, founder and CEO of the Women in Tech Global Summit, stated: 
“Women in Tech is now a global brand that promotes women’s empowerment in the technology sector, but we can’t stop here. Thanks to our partnership with Unstoppable Domains, the Summit 2024 will bring together government leaders, business sector leaders, and civil society in a secure digital space, where they can discuss the challenges that women face around the world.”
Future projects of Unstoppable Domains and Women in Tech Global
Furthermore, participants will have access to training and knowledge on transformative technologies such as blockchain and AI, collaborating to create a better future for women in the technology space and beyond. 
Sandy Carter will participate in a panel at the Women in Tech Global Summit on the topic “The future of Web3”, where the ongoing changes in blockchain and their connection to the cryptocurrency boom and Bitcoin, as well as the impact of generative AI, will be discussed.
Looking to the future, Unstoppable Domains and Women in Tech Global intend to apply for a generic top-level domain (gTLD) Web2 with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
Or the entity responsible for managing domain names. This is in view of the upcoming issuance of gTLDs by ICANN, scheduled for 2026. 
If approved, the new gTLD .WIT will join classic addresses like .com, .net, and .org, adding an additional level of recognition to the Women in Tech brand.

Traders rush to short Ether as Grayscale pulls its futures ETF plan

Ether traders have stacked up their short positions over the last 24 hours, just as Grayscale Investments pulled its application for an Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF).Ether (ETH) is hovering close to a key support level at $3,010, having dropped by 1.85% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. However, liquidation maps show traders have more conviction that the price is going down in the near term — with $345 million in short positions set to liquidate if the price goes up by 3%. On the other hand, a 3% drop to $2,920 would only wipe $237 million in long positions.Liquidation data traders are anticipating a further decline in Ether’s price. Source: CoinGlassIt comes after Grayscale’s May 7 decision to withdraw its Ether futures ETF application, just three weeks before the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was set to decide on it.It also comes amid speculation on whether Ether could be classified as a security and the fate of spot Ether ETF applications later in May. Despite optimism earlier in the year, analysts are becoming increasingly doubtful about the chances of the SEC approving a spot Ether ETF as the next May 23 deadline approaches.The sentiment among the crypto community is similar. According to the New York-based crypto predictions platform Polymarket, 92% of participants believe the spot Ether ETFs will be denied.Polymarket participants are not optimistic about the chances of spot Ethereum ETF approval by the end of May. Source: PolymarketsThere are also broader concerns over Ethereum’s overall usage and lack of speculative interest from short-term holders (STH).“Usage of Ethereum is currently so low, that their burn mechanism is not keeping up with issuance to validators,” crypto on-chain analyst James Check, aka “Checkmatey,” said in a May 7 post on X.Related: SEC will classify Ether as security, deny spot Ether ETFs — Michael SaylorOn May 8, Glassnode said Ether’s under-performance this cycle relative to Bitcoin (BTC) is due to a “measurable lag in speculative interest” from the STH cohort.However, just days before the news, some traders were optimistic that Ether’s price could experience a breakout by the end of 2024.“Similar fractal as of Q4 of 2020, Breakout could happen in Q3 of 2024 as per historical pattern,” pseudonymous crypto trader Ash Crypto told his 1.1 million followers on May 6.“Ethereum is presently moving within a falling wedge pattern, with its price testing a notable support zone.

Shiba Inu Lead Shytoshi Kusama Shares Cryptic 'EVITA' Teaser: A Sign of Potential Investments In Argentina? - Benzinga

Shytoshi Kusama, the mysterious lead developer and co-founder of the Shiba Inu SHIB/USD project, dropped a cryptic message on social platform X, sparking a flurry of speculations within the community.What Happened: On Tuesday, the suspenseful figure released a gif with the word “EVITA," a Spanish equivalent of the female name Eva, which translates to "life" or "living one."The puzzling message was also shared at the same time by Kaal Dhairya, a key developer in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Dhairya's GIF was more detailed, resembling a portrait of Argentina’s former first lady and social justice champion Eva Perón, better known as Evita. The cryptic messaging set off speculations and conjectures among the community, with most believing that it signaled potential investments in Argentina. Why It Matters: These developments happened alongside a meeting between Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Argentina president Javier Milei, after which the tech czar endorsed investments in the country. President Milei has been an avid advocate of Bitcoin BTC/USD and pitched its scarcity-driven model against the central bank's monetary policy in his election campaigns last year.While the community may wish to link the dots, it is critical to recognize that Shiba Inu’s imagery reflected Evita’s Peronism, a movement that is currently the biggest opposition force to President Milei’s right-wing policies. Time will tell about the real motive and nature of the messaging. But endorsements by big names in the cryptocurrency industry reflected Argentina's growing appeal as a crypto-friendly destination.Price Action: SHIB was exchanging hands at $0.00002289 at the time of writing, following a 3.05% decline in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Dogecoin Is The ‘OG’ Meme Coin And A ‘Billboard’ For PEPE And WIF, But: ‘Forget SHIB,’ Trader Exclaims

FTX Files Reorganization Plan: Assures Customer Repayment


							

FTX files Reorganization Plan, assuring that all its customers will receive at least the amount lost during the exchange’s fall.



98% of FTX creditors are poised to receive a minimum of 118% of allowed claims in cash.



The firm anticipates that the total amount available for distribution is between $14.5 and $16.3 billion.




The bankrupt crypto exchange FTX recently filed their anticipated Reorganization Plan in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District Court of Delaware. The firm has planned the “centralized distribution” to affected customers across the world, if the court approves.



According to a press release, the firm anticipates that the total amount available for distribution is between $14.5 and $16.3 billion. The anticipated figure is mostly based on the monetization of assets related to FTX’s sister firm Alameda Research.



While the platform plans to fully replay creditor claims, FTX also proposes to provide compensation for its customers. Reportedly, within 60 days of effectiveness, 98% of FTX creditors who hold claims below $50,000, are poised to receive a minimum of 118% of allowed claims in cash. The reorganization plan assured that all FTX customers will receive the amount they lost in 2022 when the exchange collapsed.









FTX CEO John J. Ray III shared his gratitude to the government agencies, officials and customers who supported the firm throughout the platform’s journey. He stated,




“We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors…I want to thank all the customers and creditors of FTX for their patience throughout this process.”




However, industry experts like Mike Belshe, the CEO of BitGo, shared his disagreement with FTX’s plans. He starkly criticized FTX, commenting, “I understand why the bankruptcy process needs to work this way but let’s not pretend victims are getting their money back or that FTX wasn’t as awful as it was.”

                        A recent survey conducted by the Digital Currency Group and The Harris Group has revealed that a majority of Americans in swing states view the financial system as “outdated.” However, despite this sentiment, they remain skeptical about cryptocurrency as a solution. The study involved 1,201 participants from six swing states, which are states where either the Democratic or Republican party could reasonably win in an election.70% of Respondents Agree that Financial System is Outdated
The survey, conducted between April 4 and 16, 2024, found that 70% of the respondents agreed that the current financial system is outdated, with 74% stating that it is in need of an overhaul. However, only around a third of the participants believed that cryptocurrency could address this issue. Furthermore, nearly 75% of the respondents did not consider crypto to be more equitable than the existing system, despite 80% believing that the current financial system favors the elites over regular individuals.When it came to the future of cryptocurrency, opinions varied. Only 41% of swing voters agreed that crypto represents a new path towards financial security and prosperity, while 35% believed that it is the future of transacting. Interestingly, there was a significant difference in responses between those who own or have owned cryptocurrency and those who have never engaged with it. Over 90% of current crypto owners expressed their intention to either buy more coins or maintain their portfolios in the next six months, whereas only 7% of non-crypto owners planned to invest in the asset class.The survey also shed light on the impact of cryptocurrency on financial well-being. Approximately 76% of voters who hold or have held crypto stated that it had a positive influence on their financial situation.In addition to these findings, the survey examined the level of trust swing voters have in political candidates concerning cryptocurrency developments. It revealed that candidates who interfere with cryptocurrency without a proper understanding of the technology are not trusted by these voters.Digital Assets in Presidential Campaigns
Notably, digital assets have already emerged as a campaign issue for Republican Party presidential candidates.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who later withdrew from the race, expressed opposition to central bank digital currencies in the United States.Former President Donald Trump has even vowed to prevent the introduction of a digital dollar should he be reelected.During a recent interview, he called the prospect of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) a “very dangerous thing.”Trump’s latest comments echo those he made during a New Hampshire rally last month, where he promised to “never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.”The ex-president gave credit to former Republican rival, Vivek Ramaswamy, for informing him of the dangers of CBDC.As reported, approximately 73% of US voters believe that US presidential candidates should have an informed perspective on innovative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency. Likewise, a recent report from Coinbase claimed that California voters who own cryptocurrencies are expected to have a significant impact on the 2024 elections.

SEC files final response in Ripple XRP case

Ripple Labs and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have made significant progress in their legal battle, with the SEC filing its final reply in the lawsuit’s remedies stage.In its recent response to the remedies brief, the SEC challenged Ripple’s insistence that the blockchain startup acted without recklessness and that there should be no “widespread uncertainty” about the legal status of XRP (XRP) despite the court previously rejecting this “fair notice” defense.The SEC also maintains its stance on whether Ripple will likely engage in similar actions in the future, even though Ripple has not violated any rules since the XRP lawsuit was initiated in 2020. According to the remedies brief, Ripple has tried to downplay its liability while highlighting its cooperation with the SEC since the 2013 XRP initial coin offering.However, the SEC emphasized that, according to the law, even if Ripple had refrained from violations since 2020, another breach is still possible.The SEC argues that Ripple’s assurances about changing its behavior post-lawsuit do not justify avoiding injunctions. According to the SEC, Ripple’s claims of following legal guidance and restructuring future XRP sales based on the lawsuit’s order are misleading. The SEC contends that Ripple misinterprets the order and fails to accept its implications for compliance. The reply refutes Ripple’s assertions about conducting sales outside the U.S. and to accredited investors, as these defenses were abandoned during summary judgment. Additionally, Ripple’s claims of contract changes for on-demand liquidity sales are dismissed, as these contracts already lacked certain restrictions identified as violations. Related: Did XRP price just bottom against Bitcoin? Ultimately, the SEC argues that Ripple’s assertions do not negate the need for injunctions to prevent future violations.Responding to the SEC’s reply in the remedies brief, Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, commented that the SEC’s reputation continues to decline. He highlighted that international financial regulators with robust crypto licensing frameworks might be surprised that the SEC regard its efforts as akin to issuing fishing licenses.Source: Stuart AlderotyAlderoty criticized the SEC for not consistently applying the law. He expressed optimism about resolving the XRP lawsuit. While the crypto community eagerly awaits the case’s outcome, analysts anticipate a final judgment around September.Ripple is set to introduce XRPL enterprise solutions to the Japanese market through a strategic partnership with Tokyo-based consulting firm HashKey DX.

Bitcoin Price Prediction for the Short Term: Will BTC Return to $70K Soon?


																Bitcoin prices have remained tightly rangebound since their return above the psychological $60,000 level on May 3.
However, one prominent analyst sees the asset potentially recovering the $70,000 level this month, a price it has not seen since April 12.
BTC to Climb Higher?
On May 8, Adrian Zduńczyk, aka “crypto_birb,” told his 652,000 X followers that the potential target for Bitcoin prices in May is around $70,000.
The analyst said that we were in a bull market because the 200-week and 50-week moving average trends were rising.






Additionally, the 200-day moving average hit an all-time high this week of above $50,000. Bitcoin pioneer Anthony Pompliano observed this, saying:
“Don’t get lulled to sleep by Bitcoin going sideways. The long-term thesis is as strong as ever.”
Zduńczyk added that the technical indicator was now a support level at this price.
He said that market sentiment was still in the “greed” phase, according to the Fear and Greed Index, and mining costs had stalled.
Moreover, average gains in May in previous market cycles were around 15%. The month open at $60,600 implies an end-of-month estimated target of around $70,000, he concluded.
Fellow analyst and trader “Crypto Caesar” observed that there is an arguable case that Bitcoin is forming a large cup and handle pattern on the weekly timeframe.
“If Bitcoin can start to trend above ATH’s this summer, then I anticipate a strong rally to the upside and potentially a shorter cycle,” he added.
Earlier this week, the crypto exchange Bitfinex reported that some on-chain indicators suggested that selling pressure from short-term holders may be waning.
Moreover, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes said that the local bottom had passed when BTC hit $56,800, and markets would remain rangebound between $60,000 and $70,000 until around August.
Crypto Market Outlook
Crypto markets dipped slightly, losing 1.4% to $2.42 trillion during the Wednesday trading session in Asia.
Bitcoin had fallen a similar percentage to $62,629 at the time of writing but remained sideways.
Ethereum had weakened further, dropping to just above $3,000, a crucial support level.
The altcoins were mostly in the red, with larger losses for Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Avalanche (AVAX).

This single investment represents a significant portion of the entire BTC investment, indicating Susquehanna’s preference for Grayscale due to its high liquidity.
Further diversification in Susquehanna’s holdings includes 1,349,414 shares of Fidelity‘s spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), valued at roughly $83.74 million. In addition, the firm has significantly increased its stake in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which offers exposure to BTC futures contracts. Susquehanna owned 7,907,827 shares of BITO as of the same date, valued at approximately $255.42 million — this represents a 57.59% increase from a February filing that listed 5,021,149 shares.

Additionally, Susquehanna’s Bitcoin ETF portfolio includes stakes in other high-profile funds such as the BlackRock ETF, ARK21 ETF, Bitwise ETF, Valkyrie ETF, Invesco Galaxy ETF, VanEck ETF Trust, and WisdomTree ETF. The firm’s strategic selection of funds illustrates its comprehensive approach to capitalizing on different aspects of Bitcoin’s investment potential.


Julian Fahrer, CEO and co-founder of Apollo, commented on the magnitude of this development, stating, “HUGE: Susquehanna International Group is the biggest Bitcoin ETF whale yet! $1.2 Billion held across 10 ETFs! The monsters are here.” This enthusiastic endorsement reflects the growing optimism and institutional interest in cryptocurrency investments.
Despite these considerable stakes, Susquehanna’s allocation to BTC remains a relatively minor fraction of its total portfolio. With total investments surpassing $575.8 billion, the $1.2 billion in Bitcoin ETFs constitutes approximately 0.22% of the firm’s holdings, signaling a cautious yet significant entry into the digital asset space.

This move by Susquehanna has far-reaching implications for the market. Bitcoin ETFs got off to a roaring trading start and have seen interest wane in recent weeks. The rise in institutional investment, as evidenced by Susquehanna’s activities, is expected to enhance Bitcoin’s credibility and stability as a financial asset.
Moreover, Susquehanna’s diverse investment is not just limited to direct Bitcoin exposure. The company also reported indirect exposure through its holdings in MicroStrategy stock, which possesses a substantial Bitcoin reserve on its balance sheet. However, in a recent rebalancing, Susquehanna reduced its stake in MicroStrategy by nearly 15%, adjusting its exposure in line with its strategic portfolio adjustments.
At press time, BTC traded at $62,352.

RAIR Technologies Introduces RAIRprotocol: Paving Way for Open, Transparent, Decentralized Web3 | Coinspeaker



It was revealed that RAIR’s open-source codebase represents the culmination of four years and over $3 million worth of proprietary development efforts.

RAIR Technologies, a Web3 firm that empowers organizations to effortlessly generate assets, while ensuring robust DRM security, efficient royalty monitoring, and seamless marketplace transactions, has introduced the RAIRprotocol. It is an open-source decentralized application (dApp) designed to empower scalable dApps. This protocol represents a vital step toward democratizing Web3 technology and promoting transparency within the ecosystem.
Overcoming Web3 Challenges
Ed Prado, CEO of RAIR Technologies, mentioned that one of the challenges hindering the growth of Web3 has been that every Web3 startup is trying to emulate the centralized model of a Web2 giant like Google. He emphasizes the need for Web3 developers to hold on to the principles of its ecosystem, which are decentralization, transparency, and community involvement. RAIRprotocol seeks to pave the way for a more open, transparent, and risk-free Web3 space, as the CEO stated:




“By integrating directly with our code, large enterprises can minimize risk and gain a strategic advantage.”
In an exclusive comment from Ed Prado to Coinspeaker, he noted:
“Developers can build on-chain starting with a fully working box. It takes years and millions of dollars to build production grade dApps. By starting with a working opensource dApp we can 10x the speed new developers onboard to Web3.”
Garrett Minks, CTO of RAIR Technologies, likewise emphasized the importance of open-sourcing Web3 technology. “The current monetization model of Web3 has stifled its innovation. Open-sourcing Web3 technology is not just the right move for maximizing transparency but also for maximizing innovation,” he said.
It was revealed that RAIR’s open-source codebase represents the culmination of four years and over $3 million worth of proprietary development efforts. Developers have also been given the opportunity to use both the RAIR Technologies and RAIRprotocol together or separately, depending on their project needs. The Web3 firm, therefore, revealed six microservices that developers can integrate into their projects to provide flexibility and customization options.
The blockchain firm’s services include RAIRsolidity, which empowers granular on-chain NFT operations through ERC2535 upgradeable diamond multi-proxy contracts. It also offers RAIRnode, a backend component responsible for creating modular API endpoints and establishing scalable off-chain cloud infrastructure. This allows developers to build easy and scalable applications by handling backend functionalities effectively.
Next on the list is RAIRfrontend. This service enables developers to create user-friendly frontend designs customized to their specific designs. There is also the RAIRstream, which allows the delivery of digital rights management-protected content (DRM) and ensures the security of digital content.
Not only that, there is also RAIRsync, which allows all smart contracts to sync through the Alchemy syncing engine, therefore ensuring that smart contracts are updated across different networks. Lastly is RAIRinfra. This service comprises the full open-sourcing of RAIR’s cloud infrastructure tooling, such as Kubernetes and Terraform workflows, allowing developers to access the tools necessary for managing and scaling cloud infrastructure efficiently.
The report went further to reveal that it has also introduced a token licensing model inspired by the Apache 2.0 methodology. This system requires that any development from the RAIR’s open-source code must include a specific NFT license notice in the work file; this approach is done to maintain compliance with the licensing terms and also promote transparency.

Bankruptcy law firm S&C absolved from misconduct, according to new FTX proposal

While FTX’s new amended proposal promised “billions in compensation,” creditors are unhappy with a particular clause related to law firm Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C).FTX’s new amended proposal to repay creditors, released on May 7, contains an exculpatory clause, which is a provision that relieves certain parties of liability if damages are caused during the execution of the bankruptcy process.In the case of FTX, S&C may have included the clause to absolve themselves from any potential liabilities, according to popular FTX creditor Sunil, who is part of the largest group of over 1,500 FTX creditors, the FTX Customer Ad-Hoc Committee.In a May 8 X post, Sunil wrote:“S&C included an exculpation clause so they can not be held liable for misconduct — selling FTX assets at 70% to 90% discounts to their own clients and insiders (Ledger X, Galaxy), not restarting FTX 2.0, etc if we accept the plan.”Exculpation clause. Source: SunilThe controversial clause comes nearly three months after the top FTX creditors sued bankruptcy firm Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C). The creditors alleged that S&C took an active part in the “FTX Group’s multibillion-dollar fraud,” claiming the firm benefited financially from FTX’s fraud, a court filing on Feb. 16: “S&C knew of FTX US and FTX Trading Ltd.’s omissions, untruthful and fraudulent conduct, and misappropriation of Class Members’ funds. Despite this knowledge, S&C stood to gain financially from the FTX Group’s misconduct and so agreed, at least impliedly, to assist that unlawful conduct for its own gain.”Sullivan & Cromwell is the century-old law firm overseeing the FTX bankruptcy proceedings. Previously, the firm reportedly served as outside counsel to the exchange in several deals, including FTX’s bid for the assets of Voyager Digital and its acquisition of LedgerX, receiving significant payments for its services.FTX owed up to $1.45 billion in legal bankruptcy fees to the S&C law firm, according to compensation filings from December 2023.Related: First Bitcoin-backed synthetic dollar to launch with 25% yieldWill FTX’s amended plan be turned down?FTX’s new plan caused widespread outrage among crypto investors, mainly due to the exculpatory clause, which could prompt creditors to vote no, including pseudonymous FTX creditor Rob, who is also the head of growth at Paradex. In a May 8 X post, Rob wrote:“Icing on the cake from the team that destroyed billions of potential value for FTX customers. This can't be allowed. I'm voting NO on this plan.”While FTX debtors said they would give over 98% of creditors an 11% payout, plus “billions in compensation” to the rest, some don’t consider this unfair, considering that debtors are compensating holders based on a $16,800 Bitcoin (BTC) price, which has appreciated significantly since the collapse.None of the FTX creditors will accept this compensation structure, according to Mike Belshe, the CEO of BitGo, who wrote in a May 8 X post:“0% of FTX creditors agree that receiving $16800 for your bitcoin is fully compensated. I understand why the bankruptcy process needs to work this way but let's not pretend victims are getting their money back or that FTX wasn't as awful as it was.”VIDEOHow bad is the FTX collapse for Bitcoin?

These Altcoins Decoupled Positively from the Market as Bitcoin Dropped Below $63,000! Here are the Stars of the Day! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Bitcoin rose to approximately $65,500 with its rise that started over the weekend, but then showed a downward trend.
While Bitcoin falls to $ 62,000 with its downward trend, BTC also affects the altcoin market. At this point, the decline in BTC is generally accompanied by altcoins.


While the largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH) has fallen below the critical level of $ 3,100, at the time of writing it is at the $ 3,000 level, with a decrease of up to 2% in the last 24 hours.
However, although some altcoins' rises were small, they differentiated positively from the market and left those who expected declines with rises upset.





According to CoinMarketCap data, Lido DAO (LDO) 2.8%; TRon (TRX) 2.5%; Ethena (ENA) was among the altcoins that differentiated positively from the market with an increase of 2.4%.



Again, according to Coinmarketcap data, the biggest losers in the last 24 hours were listed as follows: Akash Network (AKT) ranked 3rd with a loss of 7.1%, Helium (HNT) ranked 2nd with a loss of 9.3% and ranked 1st with a loss of 9%. Dogwifhat (WIF) has 5 losses.






The “fear and greed index” calculated by the popular analysis company, which tries to measure the emotional reflexes of cryptocurrency investors, based on the trends of market volatility, market volume acceleration, social media interest, Bitcoin dominance chart and types of research on cryptocurrencies on the internet, is today at 100, which indicates excessive greed. It was calculated as 64 points out of .

LocalMonero Sudden Shutdown Shakes Crypto Community


LocalMonero, the largest Monero (XMR) peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform, announced its closure on May 7. This also marked the end of its nearly seven-year run in the crypto space.
The closure is set against a backdrop of increasing scrutiny and regulatory actions targeting privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and platforms in the United States. Indeed, these regulatory enforcements raise concerns about the future of privacy in the digital asset industry.
Timeline and Details of LocalMonero’s Shutdown
The announcement detailed the timeline for winding down operations. It included an immediate stop to new registrations and ad postings, as well as the platform shutdown by November 7, 2024. Additionally, The LocalMonero team thanked its users and expressed confidence in the Monero ecosystem’s future.

“LocalMonero has been around for most of Monero’s life. Fortunately, the Monero ecosystem has matured a lot over these years, and with the imminent launch of Haveno and other DEXs like Serai, Atomic Swaps, the coming addition of FCMP (full blockchain anonymity set replacing rings of 16) as well as the continuing and rapidly accelerating development of the Monero protocol, we’re confident that Monero’s future is bright, with or without our platform,” the LocalMonero team wrote.


As LocalMonero ceases operations, the platform has outlined clear steps for its users. Starting immediately, no new users can register, and beginning on May 14, no new trades can start. Users have until November to finalize any transactions and retrieve funds from their accounts.
This phase-out period is intended to ensure a smooth transition for the community and prevent any funds from being forfeited. Nonetheless, the team remains committed to supporting users through arbitration and dispute mediation during this period.
The closure of the platform has disappointed many in the Monero community. Douglas Tuman, an active member of the Monero community and host of the Monero Talk podcast, expressed his sadness at the loss.

“Very sad to see you go. You guys did tremendous things for Monero. Thank you for all the peer to peer trades you helped facilitate by bringing Monero users together on your platform. Hope you come back in another form. Cheers!” Tuman said.

Monero’s price dipped from $129.69 to $126.80 following the announcement. This is an approximately 2.23% decrease. However, at the time of writing, Monero’s price is trading at $129.23.

LocalMonero’s departure occurs as broader regulatory challenges in the US impact other privacy-centric services. BeInCrypto reported previously that US officials had arrested Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill, Samourai Wallet’s co-founders. They charged them with significant financial crimes.
US officials allege that Samourai Wallet facilitated billions in illegal transactions and enabled money laundering. Samourai Wallet’s services, like “Whirlpool” and “Ricochet,” processed substantial Bitcoin volumes. They generated millions in fees while offering financial anonymity to their users.

Moreover, Phoenix Wallet and Wasabi Wallet are stopping their services for US customers. This follows the regulatory enforcement against Samourai Wallet.
Notably, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions against crypto mixer Tornado Cash in August 2022. At that time, OFAC also stated that Tornado Cash had laundered funds worth $7 billion.
OFAC’s action sparked debate in the crypto community. Many argue that the case sets a dangerous precedent for privacy-focused software developers within the crypto ecosystem.
Yet, the market is currently watching the legal proceedings against Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev in the Netherlands. A verdict is expected on May 14.

Ripple, SEC Briefs are Over, Ball in the Judge’s Court


							

The SEC and Ripple have filed their briefs in the ongoing XRP lawsuit. 



The judge is expected to announce the verdict, said Jeremy Hogan.



Hogan is confident that XRP will not be deemed a security.




The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and American fintech firm Ripple have filed their respective briefs in the ongoing lawsuit filed by the former against the blockchain payments firm. 



Jeremy Hogan, a prominent lawyer and partner at law firm Hogan & Hogan, stated in a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), that “The Ripple v. SEC briefs are FINISHED,” while adding:




“I think the SEC went out with a whimper here. It didn’t even try to attack ODL sales, just noting that Ripple was trying to re-litigate the issue (which it is). And it brought nothing new on damages.”




On the other hand, in a May 3 X post, Hogan confidently stated that he is certain that Ripple will “NOT be deemed a “crypto asset security unregistered” this summer.” 



This statement was a direct response to MicroStrategy’s former CEO, Michael Saylor, who said that Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Ripple, and Cardano will be deemed securities this summer and will never be accepted by Wall Street.









It is important to note that the SEC has asked Ripple to pay close to $2 billion in fines for selling XRP to institutional investors while the blockchain firm has countered with a $10 million price tag in its motion. Hogan noted in another post that the regulator seeks $2 billion from Ripple, “which would require Ripple to sell a lot of XRP, causing the price to drop, hurting the retail holder.” The lawyer questioned the SEC’s intentions of protecting market participants.

Argentine State-Owned Company Will Mine Bitcoin


								Genesis Digital Assets Limited (GDA), a leading force in the global Bitcoin mining sector, has partnered with YPF Luz, a subsidiary of Argentina’s state-owned energy company YPF. Together, both partners have established a new Bitcoin mining facility that capitalizes on an innovative energy resource: stranded gas from oil fields.
Argentina Will Mine Bitcoin
This facility, situated in Rincón de Los Sauces in the province of Neuquén, is designed to transform what would otherwise be waste into a powerful energy source for high-intensity computing processes associated with Bitcoin mining.
The facility operates with a total power capacity of 7 megawatts (MW), supported by an additional 1 MW of backup power, housing 1,200 Bitcoin mining machines. It is powered by the Bajo del Toro Thermal Power Plant, collaboratively managed by YPF, Norwegian energy giant Equinor, and YPF Luz.
The energy for this mining operation comes from stranded gas—natural gas that is liberated during oil extraction but not captured for sale or distribution, typically because it is not economically viable to transport it from remote or marginally productive fields.

Stranded gas usually poses a disposal problem, often being flared into the atmosphere, which contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. The new facility’s approach not only prevents this environmental harm but also uses the gas to generate electricity, effectively making productive use of a previously wasted resource.
According to recent studies, including a working paper from MIT, the repurposing of methane through techniques like those employed by GDA can reduce carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions by between 25% and 63%. This is critical because methane is a potent greenhouse gas, responsible for about a third of current global warming.
Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, Executive President and Founder of GDA, emphasized the project’s environmental and operational advantages in a statement: “The opening of our first data center in South America is an important step in our geographic diversification efforts. This will be yet another opportunity to show the world that Bitcoin mining can have a positive effect on the environment and can be fully integrated into local communities.”
Strategic Implications For Argentina And Beyond
Argentina presents a unique landscape for such endeavors due to its substantial energy resources, favorable political climate, and a strong crypto ethos among its population. The country has been experiencing high inflation rates, which has increased the local populace’s reliance on cryptocurrencies as a hedge against economic instability.

Martín Mandarano, CEO of YPF Luz, also noted the project’s strategic fit with Argentina’s energy policies. “This project with GDA allows us to bring YPF and Equinor, two companies committed to reducing the carbon footprint of their exploration activities, an adaptable and sustainable flare gas use solution,” Mandarano stated. He further highlighted that YPF Luz had previously pioneered the generation of electricity for cryptocurrency mining from flare gas in 2022, positioning the company as a leader in innovative energy solutions.
The project also marks a significant point of expansion for GDA, which operates 20 industrial-scale data centers across North America, South America, Europe, and Central Asia, further cementing its position as a major player in the Bitcoin mining industry. With a total power capacity exceeding 500 MW globally, GDA continues to drive innovation in the integration of renewable and waste-derived energy sources into the BTC mining sector.
At press time, BTC traded at $62,406.

Vitalik Buterin Introduces Safer EIP Alternative: What It Means


Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has proposed a pivotal alternative to Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3074. This new proposal intends to boost security and minimize risks for core developers. 
Featuring a novel transaction type, similar to EIP-2930, it includes additions such as a contract code string and a signature.
How Vitalik Buterin’s Proposal Offers Heightened Security
Initiating this process, the design begins by verifying that the contract code of the signer is empty. Subsequently, it sets this to the specified contract code, only to reset it to empty at the transaction’s conclusion. This methodology permits the signer of the contract code and the transaction origin to be distinct, thus offering both flexibility and heightened security.
The proposed approach promises compatibility with existing EIP-3074 workflows by transforming them into streamlined interactions within the new framework. Through this, commands like AUTH and AUTHCALL are replaced by simpler verify and execute functions associated with externally owned accounts (EOAs). This simplification maintains operational integrity and also enhances process efficiency.
Read more: Ethereum EIPs: What Are They? How Are They Implemented?

Buterin asserts that his method aligns with any EIP-3074 workflow and requires minimal adjustments for integration. It supports forward compatibility with endgame account abstraction, avoiding the introduction of new opcodes, thus preventing potential redundancy in future blockchain contexts. 
Additionally, it enables EOAs to temporarily undertake contract functionalities, ensuring compatibility with the current EntryPoint architecture.

Despite its numerous advantages, including maintaining a unified code ecosystem likely to remain relevant in future frameworks, this proposal does carry potential drawbacks. It inherits some criticisms from EIP-3074, especially concerning possible centralization and the required trust in managed code pieces.

“However, it feels like any EIP that attempts to handle the “privilege de-escalation” (aka sub-keys) use case of 3074 would have the same problem,” Buterin concluded.

Pedro Gomes, co-founder of WalletConnect, also supported Buterin’s proposal. 

“This new approach benefits from leveraging 4337 infra PLUS reduces the risk for core developers,” Gomes said.

As the Ethereum (ETH) community anticipates the Pectra upgrade, scheduled between late 2024 and early 2025, excitement builds. This significant update, which will integrate EIP 3074 centrally, aims to revolutionize how users interact with Ethereum wallets by adding sophisticated smart contract functionalities. 
Key features include a novel social recovery tool and the capability for transactions without ETH in wallets, dramatically lowering the barriers for newcomers.

FTX's bankruptcy plan offers over 100% recovery for creditors, faces mixed reactions

The bankrupt FTX estate has unveiled a new reorganization plan that promises substantial returns to its creditors.FTX creditors with claims below $50,000 would be eligible for a 118% recovery within 60 days of its approval by the Delaware bankruptcy court. Other non-governmental creditors would receive 100% of their claims plus up to 9% interest to account for the time value of their investments.Meanwhile, provisions exist to settle claims with regulatory bodies such as the IRS and CFTC. The IRS is poised to receive approximately $200 million, while the CFTC’s settlement remains undisclosed.FTX anticipates that the total value of assets collected and converted to cash for distribution will range between $14.5 and $16.3 billion. The firm achieved this recovery level by monetizing various assets, predominantly proprietary investments from Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses and litigation claims.John J. Ray III, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Restructuring Officer of FTX, said:“We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors.”Not all FTX creditors are satisfiedFTX creditors are expressing discontent with the proposed reorganization plan, highlighting their inability to recover stolen funds at current market rates.Sunil Kavuri, a notable creditor, raised concerns about Sullivan & Cromwell’s inclusion of an Exculpation clause, shielding them from misconduct allegations such as selling FTX assets at substantial discounts.Similarly, Mike Belshe, the CEO of BitGo, added:“0% of FTX creditors agree that receiving $16800 for your Bitcoin is fully compensated. I understand why the bankruptcy process needs to work this way but let’s not pretend victims are getting their money back or that FTX wasn’t as awful as it was.”However, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart supported the plan, lauding its moral trajectory despite acknowledging that the figures may not fully restore creditors’ losses. He said:“Good good GOOD! The numbers won’t equate to FTX creditors just holding onto their assets. But allowing people to get more than 100% of their claim value from the time of bankruptcy is a move in the *Morally Correct* direction.”Mentioned in this articlePosted In: FTX, Bankruptcy

Cartier: USDT to launder money from drug trafficking.

Maximilien De Hoop Cartier, member of the famous Cartier family, has been charged with money laundering from drug trafficking, using USDT. 

Cartier and the use of USDT to launder money from drug trafficking
Maximilien De Hoop Cartier, descendant of the famous Cartier family known for its French luxury goods, has been charged with money laundering from drug trafficking. 
According to what reported, Cartier and five other Colombian individuals allegedly used the stablecoin Tether (USDT) to successfully launder substantial amounts of money.
This is direct laundering for $14.5 million and hundreds of millions of dollars using shell companies, on behalf of undisclosed third parties. 
Basically, the accusation against the Cartier family member was published by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.
The deed states that Maximilien De Hoop Cartier and five Colombian citizens have laundered drug trafficking funds using USDT, through a series of shell companies that acted as promoters of an unlicensed OTC cryptocurrency exchange. 
Specifically, Cartier would have used the accounts of Bullpix Solutions LLC, Vintech Capital LLC, VC Innovated Technologies LLC, AZ Technologies LLC, Softmill LLC, and Sun Technologies LLC at financial institutions to act as unlicensed money transfer businesses, falsely claiming to operate in the software and technology sector.
Cartier and money laundering from drug trafficking using the largest stablecoin USDT
The scheme activated by the Cartier network and the five Colombians would have laundered 14.5 million USDT directly derived from the proceeds of the illegal activities mentioned between May 2023 and November 2023. 
However, it seems that Maximilien De Hoop Cartier’s business was actually much larger, encompassing “hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal transactions and laundering hundreds of millions of criminal proceeds” since 2020.
In this regard, Damian Williams, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, stated:
“The charges filed today demonstrate the commitment of this office to pursue international drug traffickers and penetrate the complex money laundering networks that seek to exploit the US financial system.”
The partnership between Tether and Chanalysis
Recently, Tether has entered into a new partnership with Chainalysis, the renowned blockchain data platform, to develop together a customized solution.
Specifically, the purpose of this collaboration is to create a custom solution to monitor secondary market activities. 
This secondary market includes transactions involving USDT within a broader ecosystem, in addition to direct agreements between Tether and its counterparts. 
In this way, Tether will be able to monitor transactions systematically, having a clearer view of the USDT market.
Specifically, the tool will allow him to identify portfolios that may represent risks or be linked to addresses involved in illegal or sanctioned activities.

FTX Creditors Could Receive Up to 142% of Claims in $16.3B Payout Plan



FTX CEO John J. Ray III stated that they are proposing a Chapter 11 plan that aims to return 100% of bankruptcy claims plus interest to non-governmental creditors.

Cryptocurrency e­xchange FTX, which caused a stir in the industry whe­n it filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, has revealed a potentially favorable­ path for its creditors. According to an updated reorganization plan submitte­d on May 7, 2024, FTX estimates having betwe­en $14.5 billion to $16.3 billion available for distribution.
The proposed plan offers a glimme­r of hope for the estimated 9 million custome­rs and investors who experie­nced substantial losses when FTX collapse­d. FTX’s plan to compensate investors could allow­ some creditors to receive payouts excee­ding their initial claims by up to 142%.




118% Payout for Small FTX Creditors
The plan prioritizes smaller cre­ditors by creating a “convenience­ class” for those with claims of $50,000 or less. Under this cate­gory, the exchange expects most of these­ creditors to get around 118% of their claims within two months of court approval. This quick re­payment approach aims to reduce furthe­r financial strain on those potentially affecte­d by FTX’s downfall.
FTX plans to generate the­ distribution pool by selling various assets, including inve­stments held by Alameda Re­search, a crypto hedge fund pre­viously led by Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX Venture­s businesses, and possible se­ttlements from ongoing legal case­s. Importantly, the bankruptcy filing also covered asse­ts controlled by entities such as the­ Bahamas Securities Commission and the Unite­d States Department of Justice­.
Additionally, the updated plan emphasize­s a collaborative approach. According to a statement from FTX, the­ document reflects a se­ries of agreed-upon de­als with key stakeholders. This conse­nsus-building strategy aims to speed up the­ resolution of the bankruptcy procee­dings, potentially reducing further de­lays for creditors.
“We are pleased to be in a position to propose a Chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,” stated John J. Ray III, CEO of FTX.
FTX’s Road to Recovery
The FTX’s collapse­ has raised significant concerns. In February 2024, the­ company disclosed that it possessed only $6.4 billion in cash, a stark contrast to its pre­vious financial standing. Earlier this year, the company’s founde­r, Sam Bankman-Fried, receive­d a 25-year prison sentence­ for allegedly defrauding an estimated $8 billion from FTX’s customers.
The­ proposed plan, while potentially be­neficial for the company’s creditors, doe­s not erase the substantial losse­s incurred by FTX’s stakeholders. However, it re­presents a potential pathway towards financial re­covery and underscores the­ ongoing efforts to navigate the comple­x bankruptcy process.

The Crypto Lawsuit State of Play

It seems increasingly unlikely that Congress will actually pass a legislation, which addresses the woes of the crypto industry in the near term. As a result, the industry’s growing strategy of looking for court victories may well be the right one, so to speak – if federal judges, appeals courts, and (I'm guessing) the U.S. Supreme Court start to create case law for companies and regulators to use, that will be one way of securing what the crypto industry calls regulatory clarity.

New Memecoin Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY) to Rally Over 6,000%, as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lose Momentum



                    

Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Solana Doggy presents a similar opportunity.



Solana Doggy has a market cap around $13,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 6,000% in the coming two days, and Solana Doggy could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Solana Doggy can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Solana Doggy on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Solana Doggy by entering its contract address – 3f3XRScU3PnaXvsZ4ZGjxDa15SmbhWeMLxHmSyNngaAE – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SOLDOGGY.

This Ethereum Update Is Critical for Future, Vitalik Buterin Explains


Ethereum is gearing up for an important update that could make it safer from potential threats posed by quantum computing. This update is focused around a new proposal called EIP-7702, which was put forward by Vitalik Buterin. This proposal is an improvement over an earlier one, addressing some specific technical issues related to signing processes that were seen as limitations before.However, a major topic of discussion in the community is the actual threat of quantum computing. Some argue that quantum computing is often used as a scare tactic, without real solutions being offered. For example, developer James Prestwich pointed out that if quantum computing were truly an imminent threat, more drastic measures would be necessary right now. He suggests that bringing up quantum computing without proposing solid steps toward a solution is not very helpful. The risk that quantum computing poses to current encryption methods, like those used in Ethereum, is significant. If quantum technology advances enough to break these methods, it could potentially put the whole system at risk. This is why there is an urgent call to start moving away from the current encryption standard, ECDSA, which is a foundational security element in many of Ethereum’s operations.Vitalik Buterin has been proactive in addressing these concerns in the past. Since 2017, he has been developing codes for wallets that are resistant to quantum attacks, which can be seen in his public work on GitHub. His approach includes focusing on advanced cryptographic methods, known as STARK protocols. These are seen as a promising defense against quantum attacks. Buterin advises that the best course of action is to keep refining these protocols and make sure every new development in Ethereum is compatible with a future where quantum resistance is necessary.EIP-7702 is not just about defending against quantum computing. It also introduces features like signature aggregation, which could become more important as the technology evolves to meet new challenges. This proposal is part of a broader strategy to not only address immediate concerns but also to ensure that Ethereum remains secure and functional in the face of future technological advancements.

WBTC thief spreads $71M loot across multiple crypto wallets

Stolen crypto funds linked to a recent $71 million wallet impersonation scam are on the move after six days of silence.On May 3, an investor sent $71 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) to a bait wallet address, falling victim to a wallet poisoning scam. The scammer created a wallet address with similar alphanumeric characters and made a small transaction to the victim’s account. Like most investors, the victim validated the wallet address by matching the first and last few characters and transferred 97% of their total assets to it. However, the difference would have been noticeable in the middle characters, often hidden on platforms to improve visual appeal.Source: LookonchainHackers often convert stolen crypto to Ether (ETH), which makes it easier to siphon via privacy protocols such as Tornado Cash — and this hacker was no different. The 1,155 WBTC was immediately converted to roughly 23,000 ETH and sat dormant in the scammer’s wallet for six days. On May 8, blockchain investigation firm PeckShield noticed some of the stolen funds being laundered. The scammer started breaking down the loot into multiple parts and began sending it to multiple crypto wallets in parts. Source: PeckShieldThe scammer used roughly 400 crypto wallets to dilute the stolen funds and reduce traceability. Eventually, the funds in question ended up in over 150 wallets. However, all the stolen funds can still be traced back to the unknown scammer at the time of writing. Crypto scammers and hackers have historically been found to be most active during bull markets.

Analyst Eyes $1.68 Breakout For XRP After Years In The Shadows


                            The price of XRP, the native token of Ripple, has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent years. After reaching a peak of nearly $2 in April 2021, it has been in a downward motion, leaving investors wondering if a comeback is on the horizon.
However, a recent analysis by market analyst Jonathan Carter suggests that XRP might be on the verge of a significant breakout.

XRP Stuck In Symmetrical Triangle
Carter’s prediction hinges on a technical chart pattern known as a symmetrical triangle. This pattern typically forms during periods of consolidation, with prices bouncing between converging upper and lower trendlines.
XRP has been trading within this triangle for several years, indicating a potential struggle between buyers and sellers.
Support Retest Fuels Breakout Hopes
The recent price drop in April, which mirrored a broader market correction, saw XRP retest the lower trendline of the symmetrical triangle.
In technical analysis, such a retest is often seen as a precursor to a breakout, where the price decisively breaks through one of the trendlines. Carter believes this retest signifies an imminent upswing for XRP.

Undervalued XRP? MVRV Ratio Hints At Opportunity
Adding fuel to the fire is the MVRV Ratio, a metric used to gauge whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued. XRP’s current MVRV sits at a low -0.5733, suggesting that the token is trading significantly below its historical average price.

This could be interpreted as a sign of undervaluation, potentially attracting investors seeking undervalued opportunities.
Analyst Projects Mid-Term Target Of $1.68
Carter forecasts an initial spike towards $0.93, a level that XRP briefly touched in July 2023 after a favorable verdict in the current SEC dispute, should a breakout from the symmetrical triangle occur.

XRP market cap currently at $28.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com
Carter, however, thinks that XRP will overcome this resistance level this time around in order to reach its more ambitious mid-term goal of $1.68. It would take an incredible 213% increase from the current price of $0.53 to reach this goal.

Experts Urge Caution Despite Bullish Outlook
While Carter’s analysis paints a bullish picture for XRP, financial experts advise caution. The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, and unforeseen events can drastically alter price movements.

Additionally, the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC regarding XRP’s classification as a security continues to cast a shadow over the token’s future. A negative outcome in the lawsuit could dampen investor sentiment and hinder any potential price surge.

White Pepe (WHPEPE) to Skyrocket 7,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

White Pepe (WHPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



White Pepe (WHPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 7,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because WHPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, White Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and White Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy White Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for White Pepe by entering its contract address – 58kSp6Sn8P42EdRDgud75YcvkRLnCpMxPb7MqCRHkUeG – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.

DePIN Projects are Expanding; which are the Hottest Tokens in That Space? | Cryptopolitan

DePIN projects aim for a novel blockchain use case, creating decentralized physical infrastructure. The abbreviation represents the merging of physical and digital space through tokens and electronic systems. This crypto trend combines older platforms rebranding and new projects using existing technology. There are now enough projects carrying the DePIN tag to establish their own category. Collectively, DePIN tokens have a market cap of $33B, similar to Web3 and game projects during boom times. But at this valuation, DePIN seems to be a growing category, with some upside for individual tokens and the market as a whole.What is Included Among DePIN ProjectsDePIN brings together several categories that have already experienced bullish booms. The sector as a whole was consolidated in late 2023. In 2024, DePIN includes decentralized storage, distributed computing, networking, AI, services and sensors for the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, DePIN is closely related to oracle services and Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization. DePIN has been used to brand projects such as Render, which utilizes blockchain technology to build art-based communities.What is common in DePIN is a drive to collect resources from users in return for tokens or points. Many of these projects aim to disrupt centralized industries such as cloud storage and content platforms. The value of the infrastructure will also be the underlying value of the project. DePIN is also a way to create elements from a real economy, solving the value problem of tokenization and token valuations. Which are the Hottest DePIN Projects in MayMost DePIN projects are in the green recently. But two of them are standing out, after defying the recent market corrections. Render and AIOZ Network are also busy building up their social media profile, while promoting their approach to building infrastructure. Render (RNDR) is an Ethereum-based token, taking the easy launch approach while building its product. Render aims to offer distributed GPU rendering services, recorded on the blockchain. Additionally, the Render project is promoting itself through engaging events with digital artists. Render participated in a digital art tournament over the weekend to promote its Octane product for better rendering. The RNDR market price responded favorably to the exposure, rising to $10.06. RNDR is now within a small distance of repeating its all-time high at $12.34. The other prominent project in the past week is AIOZ Network (AIOZ). The project reawakened in the first months of 2024, moving to a higher price tier. AIOZ rallied to $0.80 in the span of a few days, on trading volumes above $50M. This activity is close to all-time high for AIOZ, and is tied to the project’s social media performance. AIOZ remains riskier compared to Render, due to its relatively low market cap. The project aims to become Web3 infrastructure by combining streaming, AI, and distributed storage. AIOZ may remain a hot token in the short term and bounce from its relatively low price. The main reason is the recent BitHumb listing. In the coming days, the exchange will also organize a trading event with incentives, further lifting AIOZ volumes. AIOZ is also traded as an Ethereum-based token, the only version which will be accepted for trading on exchanges. DePIN Brings Renewed Attention to Older ProjectsDePIN is also hosting a long list of relatively older token projects, which gained prominence during the 2018 ICO boom. The list includes successful storage projects like Filecoin (FIL), which also added a DeFi component. Siacoin (SIA) is also an older storage coin that is now considered a DePIN asset.Helium (HNT), a decentralized WiFi project, is also included in the rebranding list. Even platforms like Lisk (LSK) are now adding DePIN to their description. But the list of hot projects does not just hinge on the potential for token price action, or the size of the network. DePIN platforms compete with users by promising rewards and incentives. With those tools, DePIN is also a way to mine rewards and hope to turn the rewards into real value. DePIN has a dual impact on the crypto space, benefiting both established and emerging projects.

Vitalik Buterin addresses concerns over Signal's protocol integrity - Crypto Briefing




Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has weighed in on the growing concerns surrounding the encrypted messaging app Signal, emphasizing the importance of free speech and decentralization in response to revelations about the app’s board chair and potential ties to US intelligence.In an X post sharing an article from City Journal, Block founder Jack Dorsey acknowledged that he was not aware of the issue.Buterin’s response to the post stressed the importance of freedom of speech as a “sacred principle” that should be applied universally.The post also received responses from key figures in the tech space, such as Elon Musk, who said that the issue was “concerning.”Buterin acknowledged how Signal’s open-source client allows users to verify that the app is not acting against them, regardless of the views held by the development team.“The one great thing about Signal is that it’s an open source client and so you can check it’s not acting against you, no matter what views the dev team has,” Buterin said.However, Buterin suggested that Signal could further strengthen its position by moving to a multi-client/server ecosystem, which would minimize the influence of any single team over user participation.He noted that while Signal’s founder, Moxie Marlinspike, has argued against federating the protocol due to the difficulty of making changes in a federated system, the success of multi-client blockchain ecosystems demonstrates that this barrier can be overcome through “intentional coordination.”The article in question highlighted Katherine Maher’s past as a “US-backed agent of regime change” and her involvement in coordinating online censorship during her tenure as CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation. It also raised concerns about Signal’s initial funding, which included a $3 million grant from the government-sponsored Open Technology Fund (OTF), potentially linking the app to US intelligence and foreign policy goals.The concerns raised by the City Journal article penned by Christopher Rufo have sparked a broader discussion about the role of communication platforms and the importance of transparency in maintaining user trust, the same principles that decentralized protocols have sought to address.

The SEC Urges The Court To Pass Its Proposed Final Judgment in Latest Reply Brief


							

The SEC has officially filed its redacted remedies reply brief in the case against Ripple.



According to the SEC, Ripple is likely to repeat the offense it is accused of.



The SEC pleaded that the court enter its Proposed Final Judgment as The Final Judgment.




The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially filed its redacted remedies reply brief and supporting exhibits in the ongoing case against Ripple. The filing is now publicly available after initial reports that the SEC made it under seal on the deadline day, May 6, 2024.







In the filing, the SEC urged the court to enter the requested injunctions, citing the parties’ agreement that the question is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that Ripple will repeat the offense. The commission also noted that Ripple does not dispute two key factors, one of which is being liable for a violation, and the other is that the offense happened over many years.



According to the SEC, courts readily enter injunctions in such cases because they indicate a higher likelihood of repetition. The commission further highlighted that Ripple’s ongoing business places it in a position where “violations could be anticipated.”



Meanwhile, the SEC did not dispute that Ripple may not have committed any violation since 2020. However, it noted that even if that is the case, it does not guarantee the non-anticipation of another violation by Ripple. According to the SEC, a defendant’s disclaimer of intent to violate the law in the future does not bar injunctive relief.









In furtherance of its argument, the SEC cited that Ripple maintains that its past conduct was blameless. Hence, the firm’s litigation of the rejected argument. The commission also highlighted Ripple’s argument that it voluntarily gave the SEC information about its business in 2013 without addressing the contravening steps it took in 2012.



Citing many other reasons for its filing, the SEC concluded by pleading that the court enter its Proposed Final Judgment as The Final Judgment in the ongoing litigation.

Confusing Ethereum (ETH) Move from Grayscale! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While all eyes were on the SEC's Etheruem ETF decision after the spot Bitcoin ETF approved in January, a surprise Ethereum move came from Grayscale.
In these days when spot Ethereum ETFs are almost unlikely to be approved in the short term, Grayscale has withdrawn its application for Ethereum futures ETF.


While this move by the company caused confusion among investors as the decision for spot Ethereum ETFs is awaited, the spot ETH application is still valid.
Grayscale submitted its application for this Ethereum Futures ETF in September last year and decided to postpone it several times.





While the reason for Grayscale's decision is still unclear, this withdrawal decision created speculation in the market.
Commenting on this decision, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said that this withdrawal decision could be a way to protect Grayscale's spot Ethereum ETF application from any rejection.


Seyffart also added that Grayscale may have met with the SEC and been persuaded to withdraw the application with the information it received in these meetings.
As it is known, the critical decision in spot Ethereum ETFs is expected to be May 23. Because the SEC must make a final decision on approval or rejection of VanEck's spot ETH ETF application by May 23.







Is Ethereum a Security According to the SEC?
Although the SEC did not make an official statement or make a decision on this issue, Ethereum Developer company Consensys recently filed a lawsuit against the SEC and asked the court to determine that ETH is not a securities.
These court documents contained striking information about the SEC and Etheruem. Accordingly, the SEC and its chairman, Gary Gensler, believe that ETH has been traded as an unregistered security for at least 1 year.

At this point, the emergence of the SEC's claim that it classified Ethereum as a security last year further diminished the hopes for ETF approval.

                        In an exclusive interview with Cryptonews, Armani Ferrante, the founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange and multi-chain wallet Backpack, talked about taking a long, winding path to entering Solana and establishing Anchor.He discussed creating a super app – a one-stop app for all users’ needs – and why it’s relevant to have one.Ferrante also touched on the future of the crypto economy and why it will be ten times better.VIDEOCreating Anchor: A Winding Road Up a Hill
Ferrante left his job at Apple in 2017. He was drawn to Ethereum, seeing it as “the coolest thing in the world.”He had no plans and no job – just a desire to work in the blockchain field.When Ferrante thinks about his process of establishing the popular developer tool on Solana, called Anchor, he describes it as “hill climbing.”“It is a reference to a way of algorithmically finding the optimum of a specific kind of curve you’re trying to optimize,” he said.He never had a grand vision that he followed and executed. Rather, it was years of thinking about specific problems that needed solving.Iterating ways to solve some of those problems opened up new paths, both good and bad.But with a bit of luck, after taking “a bunch of winding roads,” “eventually you end up in a reasonable spot,” he said.Over the next few years, Ferrante worked at various companies and projects, contributing to open source.“But the first thing that really got momentum was the couple of contributions to the Solana network,” he noted.He found Solana at a time when he and many others in the industry were searching for new architectures, blockchains, and ecosystems to meet the demands of a new generation of crypto applications.That was the time, in 2020, when Ferrante started finding his way through those up-hill winding roads.“I felt I had the ability to solve things. […] And it was really from there that a bunch of doors started opening. I was able to create a company, hire incredible people, get funding, and get the resources required to create a business.”From Mad Lads to Supper App
But Anchor was not the end of the road.Ferrante moved to solve the next set of issues by building a crypto financial super app, Backpack.“Anything that you want to do in crypto, quite literally, can be done inside of Backpack, or that’s the goal,” Ferrante said.Among multiple other things, it enables a simple way to use any blockchain and decentralized app (dapp), and utilize the growing parallel financial system that’s being built on crypto rails.And it started with the Mad Lad non-fungible token (NFT) collection.This, said Ferrante, has “been an incredible test bed for us.”While it may have seemed simple from the user’s perspective, there was “a ton” that went into every step of the way.The team was making every experience unique, moving to differentiate itself from other projects.They built a variety of games and puzzles for users to play through the wallet and get on the NFT whitelist.Ferrante often uses the term ‘combination’ when speaking about the project’s success.“It was this really awesome combination of building new products and telling interesting stories with beautiful art that made the Mad Lads experience special.”At the end of the day, every NFT holder would have two products: a wallet and an exchange account. This was a way to build a company with “a passionate group of users.”Therefore, on the inside, the team combined different components into one super-app. “It’s been kind of our flavor [and] one of the main reasons behind a lot of the success.”And they’ve combined outside elements as well: “a bunch of incredible pieces, a bunch of incredible people, an incredible community coming together,” said Ferrante.Crypto Future: Creating 10x Better Economy
In crypto, historically, we’ve seen that every bull cycle brings new liquidity hubs, which then create capital efficiency, Ferrante said.Also in crypto, he argued, people search for everything to be 10 times better, faster, and safer.“Whether you want to do 10X, with 10X less error, that makes sure that any ledger entry is provably correct with cryptography,” he said.Ultimately, crypto is providing all of these benefits to financial transactions.“When you have these things come together, you are creating this 10-times-better economy that can power all different parts of the world,” Ferrante concluded.____That’s not all!In this interview, Ferrante also discussed:
studying at UC Berkeley and working at Apple;
creating Anchor, a groundbreaking developer tool that transformed programming on Solana;
growing the Backpack ecosystem and combining key elements into one super app;
the Solana ecosystem and what’s to come;
Solana vs Ethereum: comparing apples to oranges;
multi-threaded, parallel blockchains, and the future of Web3.

                        In this report, we explore and analyze the Solana ecosystem downtime, SOL price action, and Solana meme coin action in April 2024, with a particular focus on the reasons for a staggering 56% SOL price drop.
Key takeaways:


The SOL price experienced a rollercoaster ride, dropping over 56% from $193 to $123 in April due to unresolved network issues and declining on-chain activity.
Solana faced network congestion in April, with a staggering 75% of transactions failing at one point. This congestion was attributed to high demand, meme coin trading activity, and delayed network patches.
Despite network issues, institutional investment in SOL surged. CoinShares reported nearly 15% of surveyed investors now hold SOL.
FTX’s bankruptcy estate sold 30 million SOL tokens for ~$1.9 billion to compensate defrauded customers.
Solana NFT sales volume dropped 100% compared to March, reaching $153.4 million.

What is Solana?
Solana is an open-source blockchain platform founded in 2017, emphasizing scalability and speed. With its unique Layer 1 network architecture, it processes over 710,000 transactions per second, enabling the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) for various use cases, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) marketplaces. Unlike Ethereum, Solana does not require additional scaling solutions, relying on powerful computers for network maintenance and data storage. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is essential for transactions and network security through staking.Solana On-Chain Data Analysis and SOL Price Performance
Solana’s (SOL) price experienced a rollercoaster ride in April 2024, marked by significant price drops and a struggle to regain lost ground. This volatility can be attributed to a confluence of factors, including unresolved network issues, declining on-chain activity, and broader market sentiment.Starting at $193 on April 1, SOL’s price fell to $123 on April 13. This drop coincided with a developer’s admission that Solana’s network outage problems remained unresolved. This admission fueled investor concerns about the network’s stability, leading to a price drop of over 56%. Later in April, Solana recovered somewhat, reaching $159 on April 23, but was unable to hold this level and closed the month at nearly $130.SOL/USD price index. Source: TradingViewFurther downward pressure came from declining on-chain activity. Data suggested a decrease in both DEX transaction volume (from $3,8 billion on March 20 to $691,7 million on April 28) and the number of active decentralized application (DApp) users. Daily active addresses on Solana dropped significantly throughout April, reaching a low of 981k on April 28.Solana DEX trading volume in March and April 2024. Source: ArtemisData from HelloMoon showed a decline in new-user acquisition. On March 29, Solana welcomed a staggering 1 million new wallets. This number, however, began a concerning downward trend. By April 28, the number of new wallets executing their first transaction had plummeted to 702k. This represents a worrying 42% decline in new user acquisition within a single month which translates into a market cap loss of $30 billion in 30 days (from $91 billion on March 31 and $61 billion on April 29). Solana daily first signers in March and April 2024. Source: HelloMoonAdding fuel to the fire, in early April, the Solana network struggled with an alarming rate of failed transactions, with a staggering 3 out of 4 transactions failing (75%). Solana’s spike in failed transactions may have been caused by the surge in meme coin trading. Solana successful vs. failed transactions in April 2024.

Solana Foundation strategy lead Austin Federa attributed the current network congestion issues to several factors, including high demand for Solana block space and delayed implementation of patches to address network issues.Solana’s open interest (total value of outstanding futures contracts) also fell in April compared to March. On April 28, Solana’s open interest was only $1.74 billion.SOL open interest and volume in March and April 2024. Source: CoinglassSolana Ecosystem Updates 
April 2024 was a month of contrasts for the Solana ecosystem. While it witnessed significant institutional adoption and new partnerships, network congestion cast a long shadow. Solana’s network congestionIn early April, Solana’s network choked under heavy meme coin activity, with transaction failures reaching 75% for a week. Developers claimed it was a bug, not a network issue. New projects, especially those planning token launches, have been put on hold until the technical issues related to Solana’s network congestion and transaction errors are resolved.After exacerbating congestion on the Solana network, Ore, the Bitcoin-like mining protocol on Solana, also announced it was pausing mining. On April 12, Solana devs released update v1.17.31 to tackle network congestion because of the surge in demand and network activity. This patch includes improvements for congestion and open interest issues. Some of the key upgrades include: differentiating staked vs non-staked data, efficiency improvements, and stricter controls for staked nodes. On April 9, Solana validators overwhelmingly approved (98%) a proposal to speed up transactions. The “Timely Vote Credits” system aims to incentivize validators to vote faster, ultimately leading to quicker transaction confirmation times.Institutional interestCoinShares reported a surge in institutional investment in Solana by hedge funds and wealth managers. Compared to earlier this year, nearly 15% of surveyed investors with $600 billion in assets now hold SOL, a “dramatic increase in allocations.”Crypto investments in January compared to April. Source: CoinSharesFTX’s estate liquidated $1.9 billion of its SOL holdingsIn a move to compensate defrauded customers, bankruptcy administrators for collapsed crypto exchange FTX sold 30 million SOL tokens with bids averaging around $100 per SOL. The sale generated roughly $1.9 billion. FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in 2022, previously disclosed holding a significant amount of SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain. As of August 2023, FTX’s SOL holdings were valued at $1.2 billion, making it the exchange’s largest cryptocurrency asset. Bitcoin and Ethereum followed at $560 million each.Natix secured almost 5 million in fundingNatix, a DePIN project focused on mapping data on Solana, secured $4.6 million in funding. They plan to launch their token and airdrop about 1 billion tokens to their users. Borderless Capital led the round, with Tioga Capital and several other investors participating.Solana Ecosystem and Meme Coins 
April 2024 was a wild month for Solana meme coins. While some projects skyrocketed to astronomical valuations, others fizzled out, leaving investors questioning the true potential of the meme coin craze. A bizarre scam launched on the Solana blockchain on April 29, with a meme coin called Bonk Killer (BONKKILLER) briefly reaching the highest market cap in the world at $328 trillion. This seemingly outlandish figure was a result of a malicious trap designed to steal investor funds. Bonk Killer attracted a small group of roughly 1,000 investors. However, the token’s smart contract was rigged with a “honeypot” feature. This allowed the creator to hold over 90% of the tokens and activate a “freeze authority” that prevented anyone from selling their holdings. According to independent blockchain sleuth ZachXBT, another 12 Solana meme coin presales were abruptly halted after just one month, having raised a total of $26.7 million from investors. Popular Solana memecoin Bonk (BONK) struggled to break above $0.00002462 on April 8 and fell to $0.00001346 on April 13, resulting in an 87% drop in price. Later in the month, the BONK price increased, reaching $0.00002924 on April 25 and closing the month at $0.00002171 per coin. BONK/USD price index.

At the end of the month, WIF was worth $2.45. Notably, WIF still accounts for nearly half of Solana’s total meme coin market share.WIF/USD price index. Source: CoinGeckoSolana DEXs
From airdrops aiming to attract users to a major acquisition — April 2024 was a month of significant developments for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Solana blockchain. Airdrop frenzySeveral prominent Solana DEXs announced airdrops in April, aiming to incentivize user participation and boost their ecosystems. On April 16, the Drift Foundation unveiled the launch of its governance token, DRIFT. This token will be used for on-chain voting within the Drift protocol. To incentivize user participation, Drift also announced a 100 million token airdrop. Zeta Markets, another popular DEX for options trading, unveiled a similar airdrop of 100 million Z tokens. The token launch and airdrop are expected to occur next month.However, this trend wasn’t without its setbacks. The Parcl protocol, a decentralized betting platform on Solana, experienced a significant decline in TVL following an airdrop of its native PRCL token. According to DeFiLiama, TVL dropped 218% in April, falling from $185.6 million to $58.35 million. Parcl’s total value locked in April. Source: DeFiLiamaInvestments and acquisitionsJupiter, the largest Solana DEX by volume, made a strategic move by acquiring Ultimate, a wallet for DeFi and NFTs developed by the German crypto company Unstoppable Finance. This acquisition will potentially strengthen Jupiter’s position in the market and expand its product offerings. Solana interoperability layer Zeus Network closed an $8 million funding round, valuing the project at $100 million. The funding will likely be used to further develop their technology, which aims to facilitate seamless communication between different blockchains. Solana NFTs
In April, Solana was the third most traded blockchain network in the NFT ecosystem. However, Solana experienced a dramatic decline in its NFT sales last month.Data from CryptoSlam showed that the sales volume of Solana-based NFTs in April reached $153.4 million, a 100% decrease from the sales volume in March. The data further revealed that the Solana network attracted around 487k buyers and 251k sellers in March. The number of NFT transactions on Solana in April reached more than 2.1 million. Sales volume for Solana-based NFTs reached $153,4 million in April. Source: CryptoSlamOne major driver of the user influx was the DogeZuki NFT collection. This collection of 2,800 Shiba Inu-inspired NFT items saw a massive influx of over 28,000 unique buyers within a week, with over 6,200 joining on two days (on April 26 and 27). Deez Nuts, another collection with 10,000 “nut” characters, also saw significant interest, attracting over 12,800 unique buyers in 48 hours (on April 23 and 24). This trend indicates a shift towards specific projects generating excitement and attracting new users, even if the broader market cools down.Looking beyond individual NFT projects, established players like STEPN, a Web3 lifestyle app, collaborated with sportswear giant Adidas to bring 1,000 NFTs to the Solana blockchain. The launch is part of a year-long cooperation and the first collection was available on STEPN’s NFT marketplace MOOAR on April 17.STEPN also announced a significant airdrop for its users. The company plans to distribute 100 million FSL points, valued at approximately $30 million.Notable NFT launches in April:
Husky Friends (April 23 – April 30): Launched by Mad Bears Club, a Web3 investment company, this NFT collection features 10,000 unique digital artworks depicting adorable husky dogs. Each NFT has unique features and characteristics, providing a range of collectible options for dog lovers and NFT enthusiasts alike.
Undeads: Pikenians (April 26  – May 03): This is a collection of generative 10,000 NFTs built on the Solana blockchain. The project is developed by the Pike Finance community and features unique character designs with distinct characteristics. 
Radicals (April 30 – May 5): It’s a collection of 5,140 unique NFTs featuring 3D-animated characters, “RAD dudes.” The project focuses on the intersection of art and fashion through meticulously crafted digital clothing and accessories.
Looking Ahead – Will SOL’s Price Ascend?
April 2024 was a challenging month for Solana, marked by price volatility and network congestion concerns. However, there were also positive developments, such as continued institutional adoption and growth within the Solana ecosystem. For Solana, successfully addressing network congestion and scalability will be crucial for regaining user trust and attracting new projects. Upcoming network upgrades and developer efforts will be closely monitored.The broader market climate and investor sentiment will significantly influence the price of SOL. Regaining stability and demonstrating progress on network issues will be essential for a price rebound. Moreover, Solana will need to foster a healthy ecosystem that balances innovation with responsible project development, avoiding the pitfalls of meme coin frenzy.

Bybit integrates Ethena Labs’ USDe as trading collateral


Bybit, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges in terms of trading volume, has incorporated Ethena Labs’ synthetic dollar, USDe, as a collateral option for trading, according to the information shared with Finbold on May 8. 
The integration aims to enhance capital efficiency for traders, enabling them to earn yields on their base assets while trading through their Bybit’s Unified Trading Account.
The importance of Ethena Labs’ synthetic dollar
Hao Yang, head of financial products at Bybit, expressed the significance of the integration, stating:



“Our decision to integrate Ethena Labs’ synthetic dollar, USDe, as a collateral asset on Bybit is a game-changer. What we’re seeing is Ethena setting up USDe to become a competitor to USDT, which became the giant it is by dominating the trading pair market on crypto exchanges. This creates a dynamic dualism between TradFi-backed stablecoins such as USDT and crypto-native solutions like USDe.” 

Yang further explained that by enabling USDe for use in Bybit Futures and Earn, the platform would be tapping into the demand for more versatile financial tools that empower 28 million users to manage and grow their portfolios in innovative ways. 
Enhanced trading flexibility on Bybit
By combining the different risk profiles of Tether (USDT) and USDe, Bybit users can enjoy even greater flexibility in how they manage their assets.
Thanks to the integration, Bybit users can also access USDe through the platform’s Spot trading, utilizing the new product across derivatives within their Unified Trading Account. 
Bybit also plans to list additional USDe spot pairs in the coming months, expanding the options available to traders.

The Core Capabilities of the Diamante Network
At its core, Diamante Network stands distinguished by its layer-1, hybrid blockchain infrastructure, crafted to address some of the most pressing issues faced by traditional blockchains: scalability, speed, and environmental impact. 
By implementing a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA), Diamante enhances transaction processing speeds without compromising on security, a critical feature for modern enterprises and financial institutions.
This strategic choice in consensus mechanisms allows Diamante to outpace conventional blockchains significantly. 
“Our latest deployment reduced energy consumption by 40% through optimized consensus algorithms,” Jetani highlights.
Furthermore, Diamante’s architecture supports a wide range of applications, from financial services to supply chain management, making it a versatile platform for various industries seeking blockchain solutions. Its strong design ensures that as the network scales, it remains efficient and secure, paving the way for a new standard in blockchain technology.
The Role and Impact of DIAM Coin
Central to the Diamante ecosystem is the DIAM Coin, a utility token designed to streamline the operations within the Diamante network and enhance user engagement. DIAM Coin serves multiple functions, from facilitating transactions with reduced fees to granting access to exclusive features within the Diamante suite of applications. 
“DIAM Coin streamlines transactions, facilitating access to premium ecosystem features and driving user engagement,” Jetani explains.
DIAM Coin is particularly pivotal in operating Diamante’s flagship applications, such as PayCircle, CreditCircle, MudraCircle, and MetaCircle. For instance, in PayCircle, DIAM is used to handle transaction fees and reward mechnaisim, which broadens its utility and acceptance from across the globe.
Moreover, the economic model of DIAM Coin is strategically designed to be deflationary, where a portion of the coins used in transactions is burned, thus reducing the total supply and increasing scarcity. This mechanism supports the coin’s long-term value proposition, aligning with the ecosystem’s growth and sustainability goals. 
“The strategic integration of DIAM across these platforms significantly propels its utility and engagement,” states Jetani.
Key dApps and Their Contributions to the Ecosystem
Diamante Network’s strong ecosystem is powered by a suite of decentralized applications (dApps) that leverage the core capabilities of the blockchain as well as AI to deliver unique solutions across various sectors. 
At the forefront of these innovations are PayCircle, DiamCircle, MudraCircle, and MetaCircle, each designed to integrate seamlessly with the DIAM Coin, enhancing the blockchain’s utility and user experience.
PayCircle: Streamlining Financial Transactions Across Currencies, Fiat & Crypto
PayCircle serves as a comprehensive financial application and a super app that facilitates blockchain-based transactions, supporting fiat transactions and multi-currency digital assets trading. The app offers AI-curated and customized rewards and cashbacks based on individuals’ and businesses’ transactions.
This dApp uses DIAM Coin to efficiently handle transaction fees, with a portion of the coin being burned to enhance network stability and ensure a sustainable supply. Chirag Jetani articulates the broader vision for PayCircle:
“We are evolving our platform with our native digital asset, DIAM, broadening its utility as a strong payment method accepted by an expanding network of merchants.”
MudraCircle: Enhancing CBDC Solutions with DIAM Coin
MudraCircle focuses on central bank digital currency (CBDC) solutions, where DIAM Coin plays a crucial role in fee processing, network access, and governance participation. 
This dApp enhances liquidity and interoperability between various digital currencies, enriching the financial ecosystem and providing users with reduced transaction fees and access to exclusive features.

MetaCircle, set in a virtual environment, uses DIAM Coin as the primary currency for purchasing digital assets, such as virtual real estate and exclusive metaverse experiences. Its integration into MetaCircle’s virtual banking features simplifies asset management and financial transactions, making virtual financial services seamless and user-friendly. 
Jetani notes, “MetaCircle uses DIAM Coin to create a comprehensive virtual economy, where users can engage in transactions as easily as they would in the real world.”
These dApps are pivotal in driving growth and engagement within the Diamante Ecosystem, offering increased utility and incentivization through DIAM Coin and fostering a network effect that attracts more users and stakeholders, thereby accelerating ecosystem growth.
Comparative Advantage Over Competitors
Diamante Network stands out from other blockchain platforms because it seamlessly combines speed, security, and environmental friendliness. 
Federated Byzantine Agreements (FBAs) are used for consensus, which guarantees fast transaction speeds and high security without the energy inefficiencies of traditional Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) systems. By using FBAs, this is achieved.
Diamante also offers predictive and analytical capabilities that automate complicated processes through the integration of blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI). This integration reduces the need for manual intervention and enhances the platforms. It also offers:

Better efficiency
Lower costs
Faster decision-making

In addition, Diamante allows for smooth communication with other blockchain networks, which greatly increases the reach and utility of its platforms.
Diamante also stands out in an industry that is frequently criticized for its environmental impact thanks to its commitment to sustainability, which is another key component of its strategy. 
“Our latest initiatives include participating in carbon credit markets and exploring renewable energy sources for our data centers, aiming to achieve a net-zero carbon footprint by 2025,” According to Diamante’s Co-founder & COO, Chirag Jetani.
This showcases Diamante’s commitment about being an environmentally responsible business.
Diamante’s Global Strategy and Future Outlook

LocalMonero Initiates Process to Wind Down Operations after Seven Years in the Market | Coinspeaker



The pressure on privacy-centric crypto projects including LocalMonero and Tornado Cash has recently escalated amid notable Web3 hacks.

LocalMonero, a P2P Monero (XMR) trading platform, has announced the closure of its operations after seven years in the market. According to the announcement, LocalMonero made the hard decision of winding down its operations due to both internal and external factors. As a result, LocalMonero is henceforth not accepting new user registration and trade ad pasting has already been disabled.
The LocalMonero platform was largely similar to the previously closed LocalBitcoin. The LocalMonero team has informed users that they have until May 14 to wind down on all new trades. Additionally, the LocalMonero team will be available throughout the process to mediate any trade dispute and facilitate seamless winding down of operations.




Meanwhile, LocalMonero users have until November 7, 2024, to withdraw their funds from the platform, since the website will be taken down. The AgoraDesk team announced that LocalMonero users can opt to delete their account before the winding process is completed in the coming months,
“The winding-down process begins today and finishes 6 months from now. Our support staff will be available for help throughout this period,” LocalMonero noted.
What Next After LocalMonero
The closure of LocalMonero has been a surprise to many users but nothing unexpected from the bigger picture. Furthermore, the United States and other global law enforcement have escalated the fight against the use of privacy-centric crypto coins like Monero (XMR) and Dash (DASH).
The LocalMonero team highlighted that the Monero network has significantly grown in the past years and will survive without its help. Notably, the Monero ecosystem anticipates the imminent launch of Haveno protocol, Serai DEX, and atomic swap, among other projects geared towards network management.
Meanwhile, the trading of Monero will significantly be facilitated by Bitcoin, which is highly liquid in fiat pairs. According to a popular pro-privacy X user, Seth For Privacy, the closure of LocalMonero is a sign of the heightened war against anti-privacy crypto.


XMR Market Picture
The fight against privacy-centric crypto projects, by different global governments, has seen the market share for Monero gradually decline in the recent past. According to the latest market data, XMR has a total valuation of about $2.3 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $47 million.
Earlier last month, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken announced the end of Monero trading in Ireland and Belgium. Kraken announced that deposits for Monero will be halted by May 10, 2024, and withdrawals will end by June 10.
The shaping of the crypto market by the United States and other global jurisdictions has been condemned by some crypto leaders including Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency industry has been forced to yield some privacy to ensure future growth prospects.

Monero's largest P2P trading platform shuts down - CoinJournal



                    

                    
LocalMonero is a peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform for privacy-focused coin Monero (XMR).
The platform is winding down, with the website set to shutter on November 7.

LocalMonero, the largest peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform for Monero (XMR), is shutting down.
The P2P platform announced late Tuesday that it’s ending operations effective immediately, with new signups and ad postings disabled as of May 7.
Ahead of the complete website shutdown, LocalMonero will halt all trading activities, with this scheduled for May 14. The platform’s seven-year stint that saw it become the largest peer-to-peer trading platform for Monero officially comes to a close on November 7.
As it begins its six-month wind-down process, LocalMonero says the decision to shut shop comes amid a confluence of internal and external factors. However, the announcement on the platform’s website does not provide specific reasons for the move.
Meanwhile, all users are advised to withdraw their funds before the deadline of November 7. Not doing so could render the funds “abandoned or forfeited.”
LocalMonero shuts, but future of Monero “bright”!
Shutting down Monero’s largest P2P platform could see an impact in terms of the buying and selling of XMR, the top privacy-centric cryptocurrency. Despite this, the team at LocalMonero believes the ecosystem’s future is on course for further growth.
“LocalMonero has been around for most of Monero’s life. Fortunately, the Monero ecosystem has matured a lot over these years,” the announcement reads.
Part of the optimism is down to the potential for projects such as decentralised exchanges (DEXs) Haveno and Serai. Atomic swaps and Full-Chain Membership Proofs (FCMP) are the other key developments likely to bolster the Monero protocol.
Despite this outlook, Monero and other privacy coins have in recent months faced increased regulatory scrutiny and exchange delistings. 
A number of privacy-focused services, including Wasabi Wallet and Trezor CoinJoin have shuttered, while US authorities recently arrested the co-founders of privacy wallet Samourai Wallet.

CFTC Chair Says ‘Another Cycle of Enforcement Actions’ Coming As Crypto Enters New Phase of Asset Appreciation - The Daily Hodl


								The chairperson of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Rostin Behnam is warning that the crypto industry is likely to face more headwinds from regulators over the coming months.
Speaking at the 2024 Milken Institute Global Conference, the CFTC chair says that the crypto industry will “probably see in the next six to 18 months or six to 24 months another cycle of enforcement actions” amid “asset appreciation and [renewed] interest by retail investors.”










According to Behnam, the goal of the enforcement actions is to protect investors.
“Without a regulatory framework, without that transparency, without those tools that we typically use as regulators, you are going to continue to see this fraud and manipulation.
And putting aside the legitimacy and where this technology may go and what role it might play in our economy and commerce, the internet, digital assets generally… we just have to think about things from a regulatory and consumer protection standpoint. And I think that needs to be our guiding light in terms of driving this conversation, filling these regulatory gaps and creating this framework that’s ultimately going to protect American investors.”
The CFTC chair also says there’s “common ground” among US lawmakers on the kind of regulations that crypto assets require.
“There’s a sustainability to this asset class. There’s obviously been a growth over the past six months. And obviously, we have to deal with a lot of bad events from 2022 that scarred the industry…
…but the fact of the matter is even though or despite what happened in 2022, here we find ourselves with a growing market, growing capital investment and growing market capitalization and I think a renewed interest by a lot of the entrepreneurs.”

SEC Chair Talks Crypto in An Interview, Notes Key Issues


							

SEC Chair Gary Gensler called for increased transparency in the crypto space.



Gensler seeks to eliminate the non-compliance in the space displayed by firms.



The SEC Chair deflected questions regarding ETH or ETH ETF applications.




Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), appeared on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on May 7, 2024, addressing key issues surrounding financial oversight and regulation. 



The SEC Chair talked to Andrew Ross Sorkin and stated that the regulator oversees markets worth $110 trillion, but he is mostly asked questions about the digital asset space, which is a fraction of this amount.




“Crypto is a small piece of our overall markets. And — but it’s an outsized piece of the scams and frauds and problems in our markets because without prejudging any one token, much of this field is noncompliant with the protections of our securities laws,” noted Gensler.




While talking about the Wells Notices sent to Coinbase and Robinhood, Gensler underscored the SEC’s commitment to ensuring transparency and fairness in the crypto market. 



He stressed the importance of providing full, fair, and truthful information to investors, highlighting that if crypto products are securities, the firms offering exposure to them must adhere to the same rigorous standards as other securities.









Additionally, Gensler was also seen deflecting questions regarding the approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. He also did not answer if ETH is a commodity or a security.



When asked about his future, Gensler expressed his commitment to his current role as SEC Chair. He noted his privilege in serving and emphasized his intention to continue in his role well into 2026. Gensler highlighted his focus on contributing to the robustness of American capital markets and protecting investor interests.

XRP rally ahead? Analysts forecast surging highs amid legal challenges


The price of XRP, the native token of Ripple, has experienced significant fluctuations in recent years, culminating in a roller coaster of market dynamics. The price has been on a downward trajectory after reaching nearly $2 in April 2021. 
Currently trading at $0.52120, this cryptocurrency appears to be consolidating, setting the stage for potential upward movement, according to several market analysts.
Over the past week, XRP has shown signs of an impending upward movement, recording a gain of 3.7%. This gradual increase has pushed the digital currency past the critical $0.56 mark, achieving a weekly high of $0.5671. These developments suggest a positive shift in market dynamics, leading several analysts to project a forthcoming significant price surge for XRP.


Expert analysis and predictions
The renewed interest in XRP is also evident from its recent performance against Bitcoin (BTC), where it reached a three-year low. This point is viewed by many as a potential market bottom and an optimal buying opportunity. 
Tony Severino of CoinChartist confirmed this sentiment in his analysis, noting a “bullseye bottom signal” on the XRP/BTC monthly chart, which is traditionally a strong bullish indicator.

Prominent figures in the crypto community, such as pseudonymous crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto and Captain Faibik, have expressed optimism regarding XRP’s future. Mikybull believes that XRP has reached its lowest point and is poised for a significant uptick.

Captain Faibik is even more bullish, setting a medium-term price target of $2.50. On the conservative side, crypto analyst Dark Defender suggests a mid-term target of $1.88 based on XRP’s symmetrical triangle formation, yet he also sees a long-term potential rise to $5.85.
Technical insights and market challenges
Despite the positive indicators, XRP’s trajectory remains complicated by the ongoing legal challenges with the SEC. The resolution of this case, expected later this year, could significantly influence XRP’s future market movements.
Jonathan Carter, a market technician, foresees a potential breakout from a longstanding symmetrical triangle, setting a mid-term price target for XRP at $1.68. This prediction is reinforced by a recent technical retest of the triangle’s lower trendline, often considered a precursor to a breakout.

Adding to the bullish outlook, the MVRV Ratio – a metric used to gauge whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued indicates that XRP is currently trading below its historical average price, suggesting undervaluation and a ripe opportunity for investors.
While some analysts express a bullish outlook, the broader market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic due to ongoing legal uncertainties and historical price trends. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP stands at 50, indicating a neutral market valuation—an improvement from previously oversold conditions.
With a legal decision anticipated later this year, market watchers are on high alert for developments that could significantly sway XRP’s price trajectory.
Currently trading at $0.52, XRP faces market volatility, yet the potential for substantial price movements is heightened, influenced by both the impending legal outcomes and underlying market dynamics.

Three Whales Activated in the Last Hours: They Are Buying and Selling Altcoins - Bitcoin Sistemi


Large cryptocurrency whales have made large amounts of buying and selling transactions in recent hours. Here are the activities of whales.
A fresh wallet identified as 0xc2f recently made a significant move by withdrawing 316,400 LINK tokens, equivalent to $4.51 million, from the popular cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. This wallet currently holds a total of 632.91 thousand LINK worth $9.03 million.


In another significant move, a whale wallet known by the short address 0x537 deposited 150k RNDR (worth $1.6 million) to GSR Markets' Binance deposit address. The wallet acquired these tokens from the Render Network multisig wallet approximately 18 hours ago at an average price of $9.93. In total, the whale deposited 259.99 thousand RNDR (worth $2.77 million) via three transactions on centralized exchanges in the last 30 hours.

ProtonMail hands info to government but says it’s not Google


ProtonMail, a managed email service popular with the crypto community, surrendered a user’s information to Spanish authorities, leading privacy rights advocates to claim it had violated its sworn promise to protect user data.
ProtonMail is based in Switzerland and uses privacy and security themes in all of its corporate messaging. Like Switzerland’s once-enviable numbered bank accounts, ProtonMail made allusions to Swiss privacy, pseudonymity, and jurisdictional legal protections from the power of certain subpoenas. As a result of this marketing campaign, it attracted many crypto users who wanted a private email service.
In this instance, the user was a member of Mossos d’Esquadra, a police force in Catalonia. Spanish authorities identified him via subpoenas to ProtonMail and Apple.
The secure email service provided police with a recovery email address that revealed the pseudonym ‘Xuxo Rondinaire.’ Alongside information from Apple related to that recovery email and pseudonym, Spanish authorities believe he assisted the Democratic Tsunami movement.
ProtonMail’s decision to cooperate with Spanish law enforcement came under immediate fire. The email service admitted to the disclosure while simultaneously boasting that its privacy-centric infrastructure meant that the recovery email address was the only information that it gave to authorities.
Other free email services like Google’s Gmail, it said, would have turned over more information, such as the recipients or actual content of emails.
Ideas for using ProtonMail going forward
In response to the news, some users suggested better practices for anyone wishing to remain at the Swiss email service. Given the obvious reality that ProtonMail might surrender backup email addresses to law enforcement, users can supplement their privacy by adding a completely anonymous and unrelated private recovery email. They also recommend using a non-ProtonMail VPN to access the service.

Read more: Jack Mallers’ Strike denied an email breach that definitely happened
ProtonMail, interestingly, complied with 5,957 data requests in 2022. So although its latest disclosure of the ‘Xuxo Rondinaire’ recovery email address in response to an anti-terrorism law enforcement request gained media attention from the crypto community, the company has made thousands of other disclosures throughout its history.

Tellor crypto records 20% hike - Will TRB cross $125 next? - AMBCrypto



TRB’s value has risen by 20% in the last 24 hours.
Its key momentum indicators suggest that the altcoin continues to enjoy a high demand.

Tellor [TRB], a decentralized oracle protocol, has extended its 30-day gains to rally by an additional 20% in the past 24 hours, as shown by data from CoinMarketCap.
Despite significant bearish sentiment, the altcoin has bucked the general market trend to record a rally in the last month. 
According to CoinGecko’s data, global cryptocurrency market capitalization declined by 15% within that period due to low trading activity.
However, TRB’s value rose by 32% during that period, causing it to exchange its hands at $114.60 at the time of writing.
TRB has places to be
An assessment of TRB’s price movements on a 1-day chart confirmed the high demand for the altcoin by market participants. Its key momentum returned high values at the time of press.
For example, the token’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 75.96, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 91.75.  
At these values, these indicators showed that market participants favored TRB accumulation over its distribution. 
Source: TRB/USDT on TradingView
However, it is pertinent to note that the values of these indicators suggested that the altcoin may be overbought. At these levels, the market is deemed to be overheated, and price correction is usually common.
 Confirming the hike in TRB demand, an on-chain assessment of the token’s network activity showed that the count of its daily active addresses has increased by 29% in the last month.
Source: Santiment
While other crypto assets languish under a bearish influence, readings from the TRB market showed significant bullish presence at press time. 
The token’s Weighted Sentiment was at a high of 6.98 as of this writing, confirming that the bulls have significant control, according to Santiment’s data.
On the price charts, the dots that make up TRB’s Parabolic SAR rest under its price. This indicator identifies potential trend direction and reversals.
When its dotted lines are placed under an asset’s price, the market is said to be in an uptrend. It indicates that the asset’s price has been rising and may continue. 
Source: TRB/USDT on TradingView

Realistic or not, here’s TRB’s market cap in BTC’s terms

Regarding how profitable TRB investments have been, AMBCrypto found that in the last month, for every TRB transaction that ended in a loss, 1.04 transactions returned a profit. 
This suggested that market participants have made more profit than losses trading the altcoin in the last 30 days.

Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE) to Surge 6,800% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Bonk and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 6,800% in price in the coming days.




This is because FLYPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Flying Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in BONK and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Flying Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Flying Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Flying Pepe by entering its contract address – 65orYrJbQxa5BZUWyeCsDtJC7JZg8zQYcvRZpvnnd5eq – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Bonk (BONK), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many BONK, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like FLYPEPE.

Satoshi's Ally Predicts Epic $15 Billion Bitcoin Buy With FTX Money


Adam Back, renowned ally of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, has made a bold prediction regarding the fate of the billions of dollars recovered from the FTX estate. Following filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which saw the exchange collapse in November 2022, the company has now proposed a plan to distribute the majority of its assets to creditors and customers worldwide.With the plan awaiting approval from the Bankruptcy Court, speculation is rife about how the recovered funds will be utilized. Adam Back weighed in on the conversation, suggesting that a significant portion, if not all, of the $15 billion could flow back into the cryptocurrency market, particularly BTC. Back's sentiment stems from a belief that disgruntled investors, angered by FTX's sale of Bitcoin at a low price during its collapse, would eagerly reinvest their newfound assets into the cryptocurrency, driving up demand and potentially pushing the price even higher. BTC to USD by CoinMarketCapHe went further to suggest that while some may diversify into other coins, the majority would likely flock back to Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer and more reliable investment option.This prediction comes at a time when Bitcoin's price has surged from $15,600 at the end of 2022 to a staggering $74,000 as a new all-time high this year, highlighting the resurgence and potential for gains in the cryptocurrency market. With the prospect of a multi-billion-dollar influx of funds, the community eagerly awaits the outcome of the FTX estate's distribution plan and the impact it could have on the market.

How Binance played a key role in arrest of ZKasino scam suspect

The on-chain investigations team behind Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, played a key role in leading law enforcement to the arrest of the Zkasino scam suspect.Widespread community outrage first prompted Binance’s Crime Compliance and Investigations team to inquire into the fraudulent gambling platform.The researchers used a combination of on-chain tracking and open-source intelligence information (OSINT) methods to find the attacker, and the Binance investigations team told Cointelegraph in an exclusive:“We’ve looked into all the smart contracts for ZKasino, in a type of behavioral network study, to find out who was behind the contract, but also who were the signers behind those addresses.”After identifying the suspect behind the smart contracts, Binance alerted law enforcement to the identity of the account holder who committed the fraud.This led the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) to arrest the 26-year-old suspect on April 29, seizing over 11.4 million euros ($12.2 million) worth of crypto, real estate and luxury cars, according to a May 3 report by theFIOD.This marks the first arrest in the ZKasino fraud case, where investors lost at least $33 million of digital assets. The platform initially promised users their investment back within 30 days. However, according to Dutch authorities, the smart contract suggests that the platform never intended to return the funds.Binance successfully froze millions of dollars worth of the crypto stolen through the ZKasino rug pull after law enforcement issued a warrant against the accounts of the attacker. Binance’s investigations team said:Together with law enforcement, we located the account of one of the suspects. We could act on that as they sent us a seizure warrant… so that way they were able to recover funds. But the main part of this ZKasino case is still at large.The Binance investigations team has further assisted Dutch authorities with on-chain forensics, helping identify the flow of funds and understanding the way the malicious ZKasino smart contracts were set up.The Zkasino rug pull, also known as an exit scam, attracted at least 10,515 Ether (ETH) from over 10,000 investors before the smart contract deployer started quietly siphoning out user funds.Related: Bankruptcy law firm S&C absolved from misconduct, according to new FTX proposalCrypto community played an important role in ZKasino arrestBinance’s investigation team noted that the community played a significant role in the arrest of the ZKasino suspect and in revealing his identity.Crypto investors, including popular crypto analyst FatMan, have suspected that the scammer behind the rug pull was pseudonymous ZKasino builder Derivatives Ape, which Binance also confirmed to Cointelegraph.Some of the suspect’s previous comments on X have significantly helped the community identify the scammer, according to Binance’s investigations team:Some of the comments that this person made with his moniker on Twitter, retrospectively, are a bit weird... [expressing] his wish to experience jail time for one to two years just for the experience.Despite the arrest, the funds have continued moving on-chain, suggesting that multiple other attackers were involved with the rug pull.Binance’s Investigations team will continue its close collaboration with authorities to ensure that the stolen funds are returned to investors.Related: Did XRP price just bottom against Bitcoin?

Is The PEPE Dream Over? Analyzing The Meme Coin's Price Drop


                            The once-booming meme coin Pepe (PEPE) has hit a rough patch, experiencing a price drop of nearly 10% in the past 24 hours. This sudden downturn comes amidst a flurry of questions surrounding massive token withdrawals from a major exchange and the overall future of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency.

PEPE Price Takes A Tumble
Just a few months ago, PEPE was riding high, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts with its rapid price surges. However, the tides seem to have turned. The recent price drop has cast a shadow of uncertainty over the meme coin’s future trajectory.
While some might attribute the dip to a typical correction in the volatile cryptocurrency market, recent on-chain data paints a more intriguing picture.
Whale Movements Spark FUD
According to Etherscan, a blockchain analytics platform, a massive withdrawal of nearly 1 trillion PEPE tokens, valued at almost $8 million, occurred two days ago. The origin of the transfer remains shrouded in mystery, with a high-security Gnosis Safe Proxy wallet facilitating the movement.
Source: Etherscan
This wasn’t an isolated event either. Data reveals another withdrawal of 322.48 billion PEPE tokens, worth around $2.7 million, from the same shadowy address just a day prior.
The timing of these hefty transactions couldn’t be more perplexing. They coincided with an unexpected 17% surge in PEPE’s price, leading to speculation and fear, or FUD, within the cryptocurrency community.
Theories range from market manipulation tactics to the possibility of unforeseen regulatory crackdowns, causing jitters among investors.

Community Sentiment: Bullish Despite The Wobble
Interestingly, despite the price drop and surrounding uncertainty, CoinGecko data indicates that the PEPE community remains largely bullish. This unwavering optimism is further bolstered by the influx of 703 new PEPE holders in the past day.

Prominent cryptocurrency figures like renowned analyst David Gokhshtein, who thinks PEPE will continue to be Dogecoin’s major rival in the imminent bull market anticipated later this year, are fanning the bullish flames.


Investing In PEPE: Proceed With Caution
Meanwhile, as the community sentiment leans towards optimism, and some experts see significant growth potential, the recent price drop and the enigma surrounding the large token withdrawals highlight the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

AI sets Terra Classic price for May 31, 2024


With the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency market consolidating, Terra Classic (LUNC) is going with the flow, doing especially poorly on its year-to-date (YTD) chart where it has dipped nearly 25%, but artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms predict a slight recovery for its price by the end of this month.
Indeed, LUNC has moved in the red for the past several weeks, maintaining a steady decline since the year’s turn, which has recently continued as the Terra Classic community voted against a proposal to prevent the chain’s validators from launching multiple validators on the network.

Terra Classic price prediction
In this context, Finbold has consulted the advanced algorithms deployed by the crypto monitoring and forecasting platform PricePredictions, and they have projected that the Terra Classic price would reach the target of $0.000105 by May 31, 2024, as per data obtained on May 8.

Specifically, provided that these projections, based on technical analysis (TA) indicators like relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), and moving average divergence convergence (MACD), turn out correct, they would represent an increase of 0.89% from the LUNC price at press time.
Terra Classic price history
For now, LUNC is changing hands at the price of $0.00010407, which suggests a decline of 1.71% on the day, an increase of 9.67% across the previous seven days, and a 24.11% drop over the month, in addition to losing 24.36% this year, according to the most recent chart data.

Meanwhile, crypto market analyst Javon Marks has estimated that LUNC might soon skyrocket over five times to reach the target price of $0.000593, provided it continues to mimic its behavior prior to hitting its all-time high (ATH) in September 2023, as he explained in an X post on May 6.

Overall, making any definite Terra Classic price prediction is challenging, as the situation in this sector can change on a whim, so doing one’s own research and keeping up with any relevant LUNC news or Terra Classic news is critical when investing in LUNC.

Airdrop Statement from the CEO of the Popular Blockchain Project: "Most of the Users Participating in the Airdrop Do Not Meet the Criteria!" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bryan Pellegrino, CEO of LayerZero (ZRO), a leading blockchain project, expressed concern about the validity of addresses eligible for an upcoming airdrop, suggesting that a significant number of them may not meet the criteria.
LayerZero CEO Questions Validity of Addresses for Airdrop Eligibility

In his statement, Pellegrino emphasized that almost half of the addresses associated with the project were involved in only a single transaction. Based on this observation, he estimated that only 400,000 to 800,000 addresses out of a total of 6 million could be real.

This clarification has significant implications for the airdrop, potentially limiting eligibility to a smaller subset of addresses than initially expected.



Considering that only 6.67% to 13.33% of addresses may meet the criteria, the scope of the Airdrop may be significantly narrower than previously anticipated.
The CEO's statements underline the importance of ensuring the accuracy and legitimacy of addresses participating in Airdrops and other distribution mechanisms in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.





As projects seek to engage with their communities and distribute tokens fairly, verifying the authenticity of addresses becomes more important to maintain fairness and transparency.
Pellegrino's observations are sparking discussions within the blockchain community about address verification methods and strategies to increase the integrity of token distributions.


As the industry continues to evolve, stakeholders must remain vigilant in their efforts to maintain standards of trust and accountability.

Top 10 RWA Cryptocurrencies by Development Activity: Details


																TL;DR

The leading token in the real-world asset (RWA) category shows higher development activity compared to its rivals.
Despite a recent dip in value, analysts are optimistic about a potential significant price rally for this asset in the near future.


This is the Winner
Real-world assets (RWA) represent certain physical assets, such as objects, properties, and others, and function on the blockchain through smart contracts. They have become quite popular lately, with a market capitalization equal to billions of dollars.
According to the market intelligence platform Sentiment, the token of that type that leads with the most development activity recorded in the past 30 days is Chainlink (LINK). 
“Chainlink currently produces 2.49x more daily activity than the next most active project, Synthetix, in the RWA sector,” the entity claimed.
Centrifuge (CFG), Dusk (DUSK), and Orai Chain (ORAI) rounded up the top 5 list.
“Santiment pulls notable github activity from project repositories via a back tested process to ensure only the team’s significant efforts to innovate and improve are included,” the platform explained.
LINK Price Predictions
Despite being down 10% on a two-week scale, multiple analysts remain optimistic that LINK’s value will experience a bull run in the near future. 




The popular X user Ali Martinez claimed that the TD (Tom DeMark) Sequential “is flashing buy signal on the Chainlink 12-hour chart.” He assumed LINK’s valuation could surge to $15.50 should it maintain above the critical resistance level of $13.87.
Michael van de Poppe was bullish, too, describing the token as one of the top 5 altcoins that can generate a 3x increase in BTC “with the lowest amount of risk.” 
Subsequently, CryptoWolf placed LINK on the list of “mooners” for the next bull cycle, while SlumDOGE Millionaire argued that it is one of the top “blue chip” cryptocurrencies at the moment.

Ripple (XRP) lawsuit nears conclusion with SEC final response

The last retort of the lawsuit, in which the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is involved with Ripple Labs has been filed. With this new submission, the remedies stage of the lawsuit makes a very important step, where the SEC is still strengthening its position against the blockchain company. Since 2020, the SEC questions Ripple’s assertion that it operated without any recklessness with respect to the sale and distribution of XRP tokens.The SEC said that although Ripple stands by the fact that it was not reckless, it could not assure that there would not be similar violations in the future. The regulator emphasizes that previous behavior of Ripple indicates that there is a potential for future breaches and, consequently, the need for legal orders. This action by the SEC is meant to procure sanctions that would stop Ripple from doing the said violations in the future.Ripple’s legal changes disputed by SECThe filing by the SEC contradicts Ripple’s interpretations of the previous court orders and changes that the company proposes to make to its operations. Ripple has mentioned that it will seek to reformat its XRP sales and activities based on the legal results of the suit. On the other hand, the SEC claims that Ripple’s intentions are grounded on a misinterpretation of the court order and do not meet all the required legal requirements.Additionally, the SEC slams Ripple for sticking to the XRP sales only outside the US and to accredited investors, despite those defenses having been put aside during the summary judgment stage of the lawsuit. The regulator also rejects all changes that Ripple made to its on-demand liquidity sales contracts, pointing that these contracts did not have limitations that were earlier stated as breaches.XRP response and upcoming developmentsIn reaction to the SEC’s latest legal tactics, Ripple’s General Counsel, Stuart Alderoty, was openly critical of the SEC’s tactics and suggested it would damage the SEC’s reputation. Alderoty pointed out disparities in SEC application of law in contrast to the global financial regulatory practices. However the legal situation is very challenging, but he is still hopeful the lawsuit will be resolved in his favor.The cryptocurrency community is eager for the legal result of this case, and a final judgment is expected in September. At the same time, Ripple is not stopping its business activities and has introduced a strategic alliance with Tokyo consulting company HashKey DX. This partnership seeks to bring Ripple’s XRPL enterprise solutions to the Japanese market, demonstrating Ripple’s persistence to establish a global presence, despite the legal troubles that it currently faces in the United States territories.As the last phases of the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple loom, the implications for the entire cryptocurrency market are considerable. This case could become a landmark in setting standards and practices in recognition of value in digital assets throughout the United States, influencing many participants of the fintech and blockchain sectors.

Meme Coins DOGE and SHIB See Losses as Ethereum Drops 4% - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsDuring this market lull, meme coins have still been performing but this trend appears to have come to an end. The top meme coins have seen losses that outweigh Ethereum’s drop in the last 24 hours.Legacy meme coin Dogecoin has dropped 6.8% while Shiba Inu slipped 5.5% in the past day. Meanwhile, Dogwifhat fell a sizable 12.3%. It wasn’t just dog coins though, even Pepe saw a decline of 7.3% and Book of Meme fell 9.6%, according to CoinGecko data.This comes after somewhat of a meme supercycle, as defined by a founding partner at Stratos, a crypto hedge fund. During the supercycle, institutional investors began to consider meme coins as a legitimate investment. Solana especially saw a huge boost in memes with the likes of Dogwifhat grabbing headlines before degens began livestreaming to pump tokens.Solana’s latest riser was Popcat, which is now the only cat in the top 10 meme according to CoinGecko. It’s had a meteoric rise of 35.5% over the last week. However, even this new addition to the meme coin roster wasn’t immune to the latest downturn in the market, losing 12.9% in the past 24 hours.Solana equally jumped 20.9% over the past 7 days with meme coins performing so well, but has now tumbled 7.7% in the last 24 hours.It appears that most damage has been taken by memes as Ethereum slips 4.0%, a moderate loss compared to what the memes have taken. But, notably, that means ETH has slipped back below the $3,000 mark for the first time since May 2.In turn, according to CoinGlass data, over $24 million in long positions for Ethereum have been liquidated over the past 24 hours, $27 million total liquidations including short positions.The news comes the day after Grayscale notified the SEC it's withdrawing its application to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF, the same process it underwent to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

SEC calls Ripple's proposed stablecoin an 'unregistered crypto asset'

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to be targeting Ripple’s proposed stablecoin in its latest court filing against the crypto company.In its May 7 redacted remedies reply brief, the regulator described the proposed stablecoin as an “unregistered crypto asset” and further evidence that the company will continue to engage in unregulated activities if there is no permanent injunction against it.Ripple revealed plans to issue a stablecoin in April but has not provided additional details about the token since then.SEC argues for a substantial fineAccording to the SEC, Ripple’s primary business since its inception has been the unregistered institutional sales of XRP, and it will continue to do so if the injunction is not granted.The regulator also disagreed with the company’s assurance that it would not violate US securities law because it has licenses in other jurisdictions.“This argument – akin to saying a New York restaurant need not obtain a liquor license because it obtained a fishing license in California – is absurd,” it said.The SEC also insisted that the Court impose a heavy penalty on Ripple to deter the company and other copycats. The regulator’s lawyer wrote:“Given the nearly $1 billion Ripple gained violating Section 5, the multi-billion-dollar business it built selling XRP (accounting for the value of Ripple’s massive XRP holdings and its cash on hand), the ‘low’ penalty Ripple demands would be a ‘slap on the wrist’ that neither punishes nor deters.”The SEC seeks almost $2 billion in fines from Ripple. However, the crypto firm contends that the Court should reject this demand, proposing a civil penalty not exceeding $10 million.Ripple’s responseRipple chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty has criticized the SEC’s filing as baseless, saying it was another example of the regulator’s failure to apply the law.Alderoty also noted the SEC’s disregard for crypto frameworks in other jurisdictions. He said:“And just when you think the SEC can’t sink any lower, if you are a financial regulator outside the US and have done the hard work of establishing comprehensive crypto licensing frameworks, know that the SEC has no respect for you and thinks you are handing out the equivalent of fishing licenses.”Mentioned in this articlePosted In: Ripple, US, Legal

SHIB Exec Shares Crucial Shiba Inu and Bitcoin Message to Community

Shiba Inu (SHIB) bears a strong correlation and resemblance to Bitcoin (BTC), and this similarity has been highlighted by the project’s marketing executive, Lucie.In her latest post on X, Lucie said that SHIB is just like BTC because no one is behind it. The anonymity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, and Ryoshi, the founder of Shiba Inu, bear a resemblance to each other.The Shiba Inu executive noted that just like Bitcoin, anyone can build around Shiba Inu. This post seems to directly address conversations around the utility of Shiba Inu as concerns development efforts. The community frequently discusses innovations that can expedite the burning of SHIB in a deflationary push.Lucie pointed out that anyone interested can design protocols to achieve this with no fear of being stopped or of censorship. One major thing Lucie spotted, however, is the negative role of critics who make false promises but never contribute to the growth of SHIB. To the many calling out SHIB and issuing bearish forecasts for the token, Lucie noted that in relative terms, many are already 2-3x on their investment in SHIB depending on when they bought the token. With affirmation that SHIB is currently performing well, the executive noted that continuous building by true proponents will help the meme coin project achieve its goals.The criticism of Shiba Inu, despite its visible success in recent times, is also highlighted with Bitcoin. After the listing of the spot Bitcoin ETF products, considered a historic move, critics like Peter Schiff still believe BTC is doomed to fail. On more than one occasion, Schiff has predicted that the Bitcoin price will crash badly, with advice to HODLers to dump.However, like Lucie, proponents like Michael Saylor and Samson Mow believe the best is yet to come for Bitcoin.

Nigerian stakeholders demand Binance reveal identity of bribe agent

Nigerian cryptocurrency stakeholders are demanding that Binance reveal the identity of the agent who approached them with a bribe. They state that this revelation, if given, would substantiate their allegations.In separate interviews with Cointelegraph, local crypto stakeholders said the bribery allegation from Binance could negatively affect the country’s image if not handled properly. According to Rume Ophi, the executive secretary of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SiBAN), the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)’s body language during the May 6 meeting showed that the government is willing to make the crypto industry work. However, Ophi cautioned against Binance’s potential to tarnish the government’s image, affecting Nigeria’s crypto sector adversely.“If Binance is trying to make this government look bad and, in turn, create a negative ripple effect for crypto in the country, the stakeholders in Nigeria will not allow that.”Ophi emphasized that Binance needs to disclose specifics, urging them to identify individuals involved in the alleged bribery. This, he emphasized, would substantiate the claim and enable authorities to address any wrongdoing, thereby protecting the country’s image in the eyes of international exchanges who would want to come into Nigeria for business.On May 7, Binance CEO Richard Teng provided a comprehensive explanation regarding the ongoing detention of Tigran Gambaryan, a former United States Internal Revenue Service agent who previously led Binance’s financial crime compliance team. Teng claimed that unidentified individuals approached the exchange’s employees and proposed payment to settle the allegations.Related: How Binance played a key role in arrest of ZKasino scam suspectNathaniel Luz, the CEO of Flincap, a crypto exchange liquidity platform, expressed skepticism that any Nigerian official approached Binance for bribes. However, Luz emphasized that naming specific individuals would help substantiate their claims.In 2023, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission stated that Binance Nigeria wasn’t registered or regulated by it, making its operations in Nigeria illegal. On Feb. 27, the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria argued that crypto exchanges in Nigeria were suspected of handling illicit transactions, pointing to “suspicious flows” of funds at Binance. As the suspicions of Binance’s alleged illicit operations in Nigeria intensified, the Nigerian House of Representatives Committee on Financial Crimes called Binance CEO Richard Teng to appear before the committee before March 4.The situation intensified when Nigerian officials demanded actions from Binance, such as delisting the naira from their platform and providing detailed user information. This led to the detention of Gambaryan and Anjarwalla.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

FTX Has Amassed More Money Than Needed for Repayments


																FTX filed an amended Plan of Reorganization and Disclosure Statement with the bankruptcy court on May 7 as part of its ongoing case.
The firm has proposed a way to repay creditors between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion, which it has recovered from selling assets and consolidating funds from various entities. It owes customers and other non-governmental creditors about $11 billion.
This is billions of dollars more than it needs to cover what customers lost when the exchange collapsed in November 2022, and great news for creditors waiting for reimbursement.
FTX Back in The Black
“FTX has achieved this recovery level by monetizing an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets, most of which were proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims,” it stated in the announcement.






Under the proposed plan, 98% of FTX creditors with claims under $50,000 would receive around 118% of their allowed claims in cash within 60 days after the plan is approved.
Other non-governmental creditors would receive 100% of their allowed claims, plus potential additional interest payments of up to 9% from when FTX filed for bankruptcy.
FTX Chief Executive Officer John Ray said, “In any bankruptcy, this is just an unbelievable result.”
He added, “We are pleased to be in a position to propose a Chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors.”
Additionally, FTX has reached settlements to resolve huge claims from the United States IRS (Internal Revenue Service) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
It aims to create a fund to provide supplemental payments to some creditors using recoveries that would have gone to regulators.
However, the payouts are still several months away as the firm finalizes its bankruptcy case.
Crypto Recovery
Much of that excess cash has been attributed to the recovery in cryptocurrency markets, particularly its heavy holdings such as Solana.
SOL prices have surged more than 1,100% since November 2022, when they fell below $12 in the wake of the exchange meltdown.
The asset is currently trading around $149, following a 4.5% decline on the day. SOL hit a 2024 high of $208 in mid-March but remains down 43% from its November 2021 peak price of $260.

In an unexpected twist that has left the cryptocurrency community buzzing, Shiba Inu lead Shytoshi Kusama has updated his Twitter bio, signaling a location change to Lima, Peru. This intriguing development comes nearly 24 hours after a cryptic teaser featuring "Evita" was shared with the community, sending waves of speculation across social media platforms.The teaser, which was sparse on details but rich in cultural references, seemed to send a message to the Shiba Inu community. "Evita," presumably referring to Eva Perón, the iconic Argentine figure, symbolizes a revolutionary spirit and a fight for the people. This teaser, whose context remains unknown, has prompted many to speculate whether Shiba Inu is preparing for a major announcement that could embody the same transformative energy that "Evita" represented.Courtesy: https://twitter.com/ShytoshiKusamaThe sudden relocation to Lima, Peru, by the Shiba Inu lead adds more to the ongoing speculation. Lima holds a large chunk of the population of Peru, which ranks as the third largest country in South America after Brazil and Argentina.Against the backdrop of the enigmatic "Evita" teaser shared just a day prior, curiosity abounds about the potential significance of this unexpected move.Peru has long been known as a cryptocurrency hub, adding to the intrigue surrounding the move. As the community waits for more information, the speculation continues to grow. What is clear is that Shiba Inu's lead has mastered the art of keeping the market on its toes. In what might be a clue, Kusama hinted at the cause for his frequent location changes after Shiba Inu secured a monumental $12 million from strategic VC partners in late April, stating that he had been pitching to the smartest minds in the crypto industry.The "Evita" teaser and the unexpected location update to Lima, Peru, have sparked speculation that maybe Shiba Inu is looking to break into new markets or whether a strategic partnership is on the horizon; this, however, remains unknown.

Euronav NV Announces Stellar Q1 Performance with $2.46 EPS - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Euronav NV (NYSE: EURN & Euronext: EURN), a leading name in the shipping industry, has reported an impressive start to the year with its first-quarter financial results for 2024. The company announced a remarkable profit of USD 495 million for Q1 2024, a significant leap from the previous year’s figures. This quarter also saw the successful acquisition of CMB.TECH, marking a strategic expansion in Euronav’s operations. The company’s proactive approach towards fleet modernization and diversification was evident in selling three older VLCCs and ordering new, technologically advanced vessels, including two Newcastlemaxes and container vessels.



The quarter was about financial gains and marked Euronav’s foray into sustainable shipping practices. The launch of the first hydrogen production and refueling station in Africa and the introduction of the continent’s first hydrogen vessel underscores Euronav’s commitment to green energy and innovation. Additionally, the proposed full-year 2023 distribution of USD 4.57 per share and a Q1 2024 distribution of USD 1.15 per share reflect the company’s robust financial health and its intention to reward shareholders generously.



Euronav Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



Euronav’s Q1 2024 performance has surpassed expectations on several fronts. Analysts had projected an EPS of $1.89 and revenue of $212.01 million for the quarter. However, Euronav’s reported revenue of $240.377 million and an EPS of $2.46 far exceeded these forecasts. This outperformance can be attributed to strategic asset management, including the disposal of tangible assets, resulting in a net gain of $407.562 million and a keen focus on optimizing operational efficiency.



The company’s success in exceeding expectations is also a testament to its agile response to market dynamics and its ability to capitalize on strategic opportunities, such as the acquisition of CMB.TECH. This has strengthened Euronav’s market position and laid a solid foundation for sustainable growth in the evolving shipping industry landscape.





Guidance and Future Outlook



Looking ahead, Euronav has provided optimistic guidance for the coming quarters. The company expects continued growth in global oil demand, with projections indicating a rise of +1.3 mb/d in 2024 and +1.1 mb/d in 2025. This demand, coupled with the anticipated increase in tonne-mile crude oil trade, positions Euronav favorably in the tanker market. Furthermore, the company’s strategic fleet developments, including adding low carbon-emitting vessels and focusing on hydrogen and ammonia fuel technologies, are expected to drive long-term value creation.



Euronav’s outlook is also buoyed by the tanker market dynamics, with a supportive supply-side scenario characterized by a below-average order book and an aging global fleet. These factors and geopolitical tensions and the potential for increased oil supply route disruptions may lead to heightened demand for Euronav’s services. The company’s dry-bulk and container segments also show promising growth trajectories, underpinned by strong market fundamentals and strategic fleet expansions.

Bitcoin Price Outlook: Top Five Analysts Weigh In on BTC's Future


As Bitcoin (BTC) teeters on the brink of significant price movements, five leading analysts offer their insights on the future trajectory of the world’s premier cryptocurrency. 
These projections come at a critical juncture as the digital asset market reacts to a variety of economic signals.
Bitcoin Battles Between Key Support and Resistance Levels

Meanwhile, Crypto_Chase emphasizes the need for Bitcoin to maintain a foothold at the $60,000 to $61,000 range to keep bullish hopes alive. This support zone is critical for Bitcoin to avoid a bearish downturn and sustain its upward momentum.

ColdBloodShill provides a nuanced view, pointing out the immediate hopes tied to low-time-frame (LTF) charts but also cautioning about potential high-time-frame (HTF) concerns.

In his video describing the current market structure on the daily price chart, he suggests that while short-term gains may be on the horizon, long-term forecasts remain clouded by uncertainty.

“We’ve got this kind of horrible little mixture of both lower time frame hope and higher time frame concern,” ColdBloodShill added.

Comparatively, CarpeNoctom delves into daily chart patterns, noting that Bitcoin is back within the daily Ichumoku cloud, indicating a neutral trend. The analyst predicts that the market might remain in this state for at least another ten days, advising traders to watch for an emerging inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which could signal upcoming price movements.

“Trend remains NEUTRAL so long as price remains in cloud and BEARISH once we get a daily close beflow the cloud.” CarpeNoctom stated.

Crypto_birb predicts a potential May price target of around $70,000, bolstered by positive underpinnings from the Bitcoin ETF market and a solid correlation with the S&P 500. Furthermore, the analysis includes technical support at the $61,000 level with resistance near $64,000, setting the stage for possible bullish behavior if these levels are effectively managed.

Bitcoin Price Prediction: Consolidation Remains Center Stage
These insights collectively suggest that the immediate future of Bitcoin could swing based on key technical levels and broader market sentiment. Currently, the price action remains in a consolidation phase. 
Conversely, $60,000 remains a crucial and psychological support level for BTC. While a bearish scenario could still trigger a sell-off to the mid-$50,000 area.

Also, the bullish thesis is mixed, with $64,000 playing a crucial resistance zone for BTC. Should this level be reclaimed and held, the price could continue its journey back to $70,000 once again.

Finally, The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also remains just below 50, indicating that the price is neither oversold nor overbought. This adds credence to the fact that the price is consolidating before its next major move.

Can PEPE Price Climb 27% to New All-Time High?


PEPE price noted a decline over the past few days, but this dip has likely been setting up the meme coin for a rise.
Additionally, with whales behaving in accordance with similar historical instances, the potential is strengthening.
Pepe Whales Choose to Dump
PEPE price tends to be significantly impacted by its whale addresses. These investors tend to hold the most supply of an asset. Generally, whale selling is considered a bad sign as it exhibits a lack of confidence.
However, in the case of PEPE, it is the opposite. The supply held by top non-exchange addresses over the last five days has declined by 2.5 trillion PEPE. This supply is worth nearly $20 million and is currently signaling optimism.

Historically, PEPE whale selling has been followed by a sharp increase in price. The larger the selling, the higher the rally. The same is also expected this time since whales can already be seen selling.

This is the first signal that a rally could be next.
Secondly, PEPE holders are at a crucial junction of profits, which could keep them motivated to remain bullish. Over 79 trillion PEPE worth $623 million bought is awaiting profits. Bought between $0.0000070 and $0.0000099, this chunk would become profitable as soon as PEPE hits a new all-time high.

Since this is one of the largest chunks of supply dangling in uncertainty, investors would likely be incentivized to prevent from selling. Consequently, the PEPE price would be noted to increase.
PEPE Price Prediction: Another 27% Rise Likely?

PEPE price trading is currently above the critical support of $0.0000077. The meme coin will likely head towards completing the 60% rally it was anticipated to witness. This target was set by the descending wedge PEPE was in before breaking out two weeks ago.
Despite the rally, PEPE did not successfully achieve the target and is still 27% away from $0.0000100. Given the aforementioned factors, the meme coin could complete this rally this time to secure $0.0000100 as support.

However, if the support of $0.0000077 is lost, the PEPE price could fall to $0.0000063. Losing this support would invalidate the bullish thesis, resulting in extended losses for investors.

Solana could flip Ethereum in transaction fees within a week: Report

The Solana network could be on track to overtake the Ethereum network in transaction fees, a potentially significant development for Solana’s status as a so-called “Ethereum-killer.”Solana could flip Ethereum’s transaction fees as soon as this week, according to Dan Smith, senior research analyst at Blockworks, who wrote in a May 7 X post:“Solana will flip Ethereum in transaction fees + captured MEV this month, maybe even this week.”Captured MEV, or Maximal Extractable Value, refers to profits that are mostly captured through arbitrage trading on the protocols. MEV measures the maximum amount of value that can be extracted from a blockchain by a user or a group of users.Moreover, Solana’s $2.8 million total economic value was near Ethereum’s $3.1 million total economic value on May 7, according to Smith’s X post:“Defining “total economic value” (shill me better names) as total transaction fees + captured MEV returned to validators. Yesterday, Ethereum: $3,165,772, Solana: $2,803,313.”Total Economic Value, Solana, and Ethereum. Source: Dan SmithHowever, Solana’s daily transaction fees are still far from Ethereum’s. Ethereum generated over $2.75 million worth of fees in the past 24 hours, compared to Solana’s $1.49 million, according to DefiLlama data.Solana and Ethereum TVL. Source: DefiLlamaLooking at the total value locked (TVL), Solana’s $3.94 billion TVL is still a small fraction, or around 7.4% of the Ethereum network’s over $53 billion TVL.Related: How Binance played a key role in arrest of ZKasino scam suspectIs Solana really an “Ethereum killer”?Solana launched on mainnet in March 2020, with a claimed throughput of 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), promising to improve on the lack of scalability and inefficiencies of Ethereum, as a so-called “Ethereum-killer.”Unlike Ethereum’s modular approach to scalability via layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions, Solana’s monolithic approach aims to create scalability and low fees as a standalone blockchain network.However, Solana’s approach saw widespread criticism following its previous outages. At the beginning of April, the demand for memecoins caused approximately 75% of Solana transactions to fail, as the network was unable to handle the large demand.On Feb. 6, block production on Solana stopped for approximately five hours, before engineers and validators were able to restart the network, according to Solana’s status page.Related: Bankruptcy law firm S&C absolved from misconduct, according to new FTX proposal

FTX's Astonishing Bankruptcy Success: Creditors to Receive 100%+ Payouts | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a stunning turn of events, cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which collapsed in November 2022, has accumulated billions of dollars more than the amount needed to cover customer losses. This extraordinary development sets the stage for a rare outcome in U.S. bankruptcy proceedings, where creditors are poised to receive full recoveries plus interest.



The FTX bankruptcy case has defied expectations, as lower-ranking creditors typically receive only a fraction of their holdings in such situations. However, FTX has benefited from a strong rally in cryptocurrencies, particularly Solana ($SOL), a token heavily backed by the exchange’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, who has since been convicted of fraud. Additionally, the company has successfully sold numerous other assets, including stakes in various venture capital projects, such as the artificial intelligence company Anthropic.



As Bloomberg reported, John Ray, who took over as FTX’s CEO when the company collapsed, expressed his astonishment at the outcome, stating, “In any bankruptcy, this is just an unbelievable result.” Once FTX completes the sale of all its assets, it is expected to have up to $16.3 billion in cash to distribute while owing approximately $11 billion to customers and other non-governmental creditors.



FTX’s impressive recovery is particularly striking given the initial comparisons drawn between its collapse and the fraud-fueled downfall of Enron Corp. and the unraveling of Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. Earlier this year, the company reported having about $6.4 billion in cash, a figure that has since grown substantially.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

While all debts will be repaid in full, plus interest, court documents filed in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, indicate that there will be no remaining funds for equity holders. FTX’s major equity holders include prominent names such as Sequoia Capital, Thoma Bravo, Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte, and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, as well as individuals like Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen.



The company’s restructuring advisers have proposed setting up a fund to pay some creditors, including those who lent FTX crypto, using money that would have otherwise gone to government regulators. They have also been diligently tracking down the company’s assets and untangling a complex web of accounts scattered around the world.



The crypto rebound, which has seen the price of Bitcoin roughly quadruple since late 2022, has given a massive boost to FTX’s recoveries. Depending on the type of claim they hold, some creditors could recover as much as 142% of what they are owed, while the vast majority of customers are likely to receive 118% of their holdings on the FTX platform at the time the company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy.



The prospect of such substantial recoveries has driven up the price of creditor claims, with some now being traded at more than 100% of their face value. This is a stark contrast to the immediate aftermath of the bankruptcy, when many claims traded for as little as three cents on the dollar.



As the FTX bankruptcy case enters its final stages, the company’s restructuring advisers have laid out new details of their proposal to distribute the cash to creditors and bring the Chapter 11 case to a close. The plan will be put to a vote by creditors, and U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey will consider the outcome when deciding whether to approve the payout plan later this summer.

LayerZero's Airdrop Filters: Who Really Qualifies?


LayerZero’s CEO, Bryan Pellegrino, shared new information amid the airdrop anticipation. In a Telegram group discussion, he revealed a surprising detail.
Pellegrino’s findings indicate a strict filter. The airdrop aims to reach truly active users. 
From Participation to Protection: LayerZero’s Airdrop Eligibility Strategy
Pellegrino found that nearly half of the addresses linked to LayerZero had only one transaction. He estimated that only 400,000 to 800,000 out of 6 million addresses truly participate in the network. This makes about 6.67% to 13.33% of the total addresses eligible.
In addition to establishing eligibility criteria, Pellegrino emphasized the importance of internal fairness. On May 7, he announced that no LayerZero Labs employees are allowed to partake in the airdrop.

“It will be a fireable offense and has been announced internally for some time and has always been the case,” he wrote.

Furthermore, LayerZero Labs, the entity behind LayerZero, is taking steps to fight Sybil farmers ahead of its airdrop. On May 4, it announced a grace period for those involved in Sybil activities to self-report.
Those who come forward within a 14-day window can keep 15% of their intended allocation. The company also plans to identify and penalize unreported Sybil users to enhance the fairness and security of the airdrop.

BeInCrypto previously reported that LayerZero Labs has announced the completion of a snapshot tied to an upcoming crypto airdrop. This event was captured at 11:59:59 PM UTC on May 1, 2024. However, LayerZero has yet to provide further details regarding the snapshot.
LayerZero’s strategic approach supports its mission of fostering a fair and thriving ecosystem. By implementing these measures, the company ensures that the airdrop benefits only those genuinely engaged in the network.
LayerZero is an interoperability protocol. It allows developers to build cross-chain applications with modular security parameters.

The company has also secured significant funding, raising $120 million in a Series B round. This increased its valuation to $3 billion.
Major investors like a16z Crypto, Circle Ventures, and Sequoia Capital have backed LayerZero. Given its background, it is plausible that the crypto community eagerly awaits the project’s airdrop.

                        China, known for its significant share of the global cryptocurrency mining industry, has been grappling with the environmental ramifications of its burgeoning blockchain sector. With concerns over carbon emissions and energy consumption on the rise, regulatory bodies are under pressure to address these issues.In a bid to understand the future landscape of this burgeoning sector, we consulted three leading AI platforms—ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot—to predict the fate of eco-friendly digital currencies, often termed “green cryptocurrencies.”Regulations on Big Crypto Energy
The focus on sustainability has prompted governments worldwide to scrutinize the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies. Forthcoming regulations are expected to center on reducing the energy consumption of these technologies, with potential restrictions placed on high-energy blockchains. Green cryptocurrencies are those that utilize blockchain technology to ensure a significantly reduced carbon footprint. This is primarily achieved through the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which requires far less energy than the traditional Proof of Work (PoW) system used by platforms like Bitcoin. Examples of green cryptocurrencies include Cardano, Algorand, and Tezos, which promise a more sustainable approach to digital transactions and asset management.Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin, the first and most famous cryptocurrency, faces increasing scrutiny due to its significant energy demands and consequent carbon emissions. A single Bitcoin transaction consumes over 705 kWh of electricity, according to Digiconomist. This is enough to power an average U.S. household for about 60 days.While Bitcoin has shown resilience and adaptability, the increasing focus on green technologies might influence its price and the broader investor landscape, potentially driving a shift towards more sustainable alternatives.China to Ban High-Energy Blockchains
On the global stage, the response to the crypto energy crisis varies. Countries like Sweden and Iceland have embraced green crypto mining thanks to their abundant renewable energy sources. Conversely, China, once a powerhouse in the crypto mining world, is predicted to implement a ban on high-energy blockchains in a decisive move to curb the environmental degradation linked to these activities.This looming ban could set a precedent, urging other nations to consider similar restrictions or to adopt more sustainable practices in the cryptocurrency mining industry. The collective shift towards green crypto could redefine the economic and environmental landscape of digital finance, presenting a new paradigm where technology and sustainability are no longer at odds but are intertwined for global betterment.

Whale Conviction Dwindling? Analytics Firm Looks at Accumulation Activity of Large Bitcoin Holders Following Dip - The Daily Hodl


								Analytics firm IntoTheBlock is issuing an alert, saying that deep-pocketed Bitcoin (BTC) investors are starting to flash signs of exhaustion.
IntoTheBlock says on the social media platform X that Bitcoin whales have taken every opportunity since March of this year to load up on BTC whenever the crypto king pulls back.










But the analytics firm warns that wallets holding more than 1,000 BTC are starting to show disinterest in buying the dip as Bitcoin struggles to maintain bullish momentum above $60,000.
IntoTheBlock says that large holders’ netflow, a metric tracking the Bitcoin moving in and out of whale wallets by measuring the amount of inflows minus outflows, has plummeted since its huge spike in March.
“Whales are buying the dip, but is their conviction dwindling?
Addresses holding over 1,000 BTC have accumulated strongly in recent months, especially during dips.
Prices have increased shortly following every accumulation.
However, note that each spike in accumulation by these holders is smaller than the last.
Could this indicate that whales have less and less appetite to buy the dip?”
Source: IntoTheBlock/X
At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $62,671, down 1.31% in the last 24 hours.
IntoTheBlock is also closely watching the activities of investors in Chainlink (LINK), a decentralized oracle crypto project. According to the analytics firm, market participants are loading up LINK despite its bearish price action as of late.
“Despite recent price movements, data from the past month shows a negative net flow from exchanges for LINK, indicating accumulation.
During this period, the total net outflow amounted to nearly 3.6 million LINK.”

Source: IntoTheBlock/X
At time of writing, LINK is worth $14, down more than 3.6% on the day.

                        A joint operation involving national authorities from Austria, Cyprus, and the Czech Republic has led to the arrest of six individuals connected to an online scam related to the sale of rights or tokens for a supposed new cryptocurrency. Supported by Eurojust and Europol, the coordinated action resulted in the seizure and freezing of assets totaling €2 million, according to an official announcement.The operation included the execution of search warrants and the apprehension of the main suspects, the report said.Scammers Posed as Legitimate Trading Company
The fraudulent scheme took place between December 2017 and February 2018, during which the scammers posed as operators of a legitimate online trading company that had allegedly launched a new cryptocurrency. They offered 10 million tokens or rights to the new currency for sale, accepting payments in established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. To gain credibility with investors, the fraudsters claimed to have developed their own software and algorithm for token sales.However, in February 2018, the perpetrators abruptly closed all their social media accounts and took down the fake company’s website, executing what is commonly known as an exit scam. This move exposed the fact that investors had been deceived, resulting in losses estimated at around €6 million. Not all victims of the fraud have been identified at this stage.The report said that Eurojust played a crucial role in supporting the operation against the online scam by establishing a coordination center to facilitate real-time communication among the participating authorities. This enabled the swift execution of European Arrest Warrants and search warrants. Europol also contributed to the operation by deploying a mobile office in Cyprus and organizing operational meetings. Additionally, they worked closely with the Austrian desk at Eurojust to provide a comprehensive analysis of the investigation.Instagram Influencer ‘Jay Mazini’ Sentenced to 7 Years in Prison
In another incident, Instagram influencer Jebara Igbara, known as “Jay Mazini,” has been sentenced to seven years in prison for orchestrating a multi-million dollar crypto Ponzi scheme.Igbara, a 28-year-old from New Jersey, pleaded guilty to fraud charges, confessing to running a Ponzi scheme that involved cryptocurrency fraud and resulted in approximately $8 million in illicit gains.The money was used to fund an extravagant lifestyle, including luxury cars and excessive gambling.More recently, Queensland Police took action against an alleged crypto investment fraud operating on the Gold Coast, resulting in the arrest and charging of four individuals. The investigation, led by the Financial and Cyber Crime Group Money Laundering Unit, began in July 2022.The search focused on companies including Crypto Advisers Australia, Strategic Capital, Active Marketing Solutions, and Alternative Capital, which were suspected of engaging in fraud and money laundering activities.As reported, the first quarter of this year has seen $336 million lost to Web3 hackers and fraud, with nearly half of the capital stolen in January alone.

Starting on May 14, new trades will be disabled and the website itself is scheduled to be taken down on November 7, 2024.The LocalMonero team urged users to recover their funds from their arbitration bond wallets before November 7, 2024, "otherwise the funds may be considered abandoned/forfeited." Support will be available for users until the November 7 closure date.What is LocalMonero?LocalMonero is a P2P exchange on which users can buy and sell the privacy coin Monero (XMR). The platform does not perform know-your-customer (KYC) checks. That's a feature, not an oversight. The exchange advertises itself as enabling users to purchase Monero "anonymously without ID verification."Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have a public ledger of transactions, with pseudo-anonymous wallet addresses. Once KYC checks are performed on those wallets, an individual's identity can be linked to a complete record of their wallet's transaction history.Privacy coins such as Monero use an array of cryptographic techniques to shield identifying information, enabling users to transact anonymously.Monero has come under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators; in 2020, the IRS offered a reward for anyone able to crack Monero's privacy features, while crypto exchanges such as Binance have delisted it. Just this month, the UK government singled out privacy coins as "not conducive to the public good."LocalMonero's closure comes as crypto privacy projects are coming under increased pressure from law enforcement. Last month, the founders of Bitcoin mixer Samourai Wallet were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, following the arrest last year of Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm on similar charges.In both cases, U.S. prosecutors have adopted a wider interpretation of money transmitting laws, encompassing developers who have no direct control over user assets—sparking fears of a crackdown on crypto privacy. Following the arrests, multiple crypto privacy projects have shut down, or cut off access to U.S. citizens.In a statement accompanying the announcement of LocalMonero's closure, the team behind the platform argued that the Monero ecosystem is in rude health.They pointed to the imminent launch of Monero DEXs including Haveno and Serai, as well as the development of new privacy features such as Full-Chain Membership Proofs (FCMP), stating that, "We're confident that Monero's future is bright, with or without our platform."Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Solana Trader Loses $37K in Memecoin Trade Due to FOMO and Panic Selling | Cryptoglobe


                                
In the fast-paced and often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency trading, emotions can play a significant role in the decision-making process. A recent example of this phenomenon involves a Solana (SOL) trader who experienced a substantial loss of $37,000 while speculating on a meme coin called $DEVIN. The incident, reported by Lookonchain, highlights the dangers of succumbing to the fear of missing out (FOMO) and the pitfalls of panic selling.



As told by a recent article in Finbold, the story begins with the trader purchasing 398 SOL worth of DEVIN during a price surge, driven by the desire to capitalize on the coin’s apparent momentum. However, the chart quickly formed a local high at these levels, and the price began to drop just minutes after the purchase. Faced with the prospect of mounting losses, the trader made a hasty decision to sell their entire DEVIN stack for 158.8 SOL just 17 minutes after the initial acquisition.



This panic selling, also known as capitulation, is a common reaction among investors who find themselves in a rapidly deteriorating market. The goal is to minimize potential losses, operating under the assumption that the price will continue to plummet. In this particular case, the trader’s decision to sell was justified by the subsequent price action, as the panic sell occurred during the first five minutes of a 50-minute crash.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

However, the story does not end there. Shortly after the trader sold their DEVIN stack, the market experienced a significant retracement, with prices eventually surpassing the SOL-cost average of the trader’s FOMO purchases. This turn of events illustrates the potential consequences of making investment decisions based on emotions rather than rational analysis.



The FOMO behavior exhibited by the trader is a common occurrence in the cryptocurrency space, where investors often feel compelled to enter a position after witnessing a substantial price increase. Unfortunately, this approach frequently leads to buying at local tops, resulting in negative returns.



In hindsight, the Solana trader’s losses could have been mitigated or even avoided by employing a more measured approach. Had the trader waited for a correction before making their purchases, they may have secured a more favorable entry point. Furthermore, if the trader had resisted the urge to panic sell and instead waited for the volatility to subside, they might have found themselves holding a profitable stack of DEVIN.



The incident serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of emotional control in cryptocurrency trading. As Lookonchain aptly advised, investors should strive to avoid FOMO and exercise patience when making investment decisions. Cryptocurrencies are notorious for their high volatility, and allowing emotions to dictate financial choices can lead to suboptimal outcomes.

Santiment Cited Render's (RNDR) Incredible Performance as an Example: Names 4 Other Altcoins to Watch Out For - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment announced in its latest analysis that altcoins in the field of artificial intelligence continue their rise.
The company cited the Render (RNDR) altcoin as an example. RNDR has increased by 50% in the last week.


However, Santiment analysts drew attention to some altcoins in the same area with the rise in Render. According to analysts, RNDR is currently one of the most trending altcoins with an increasing mention rate on social media networks.
Analysts said that cryptocurrency users can also closely follow the altcoins AIOZ Network (AIOZ), Turbo (TURBO), Cirus Foundation (CIRUS) and DeriProtocol (DERI).






This interest in the field of artificial intelligence has also shown its impact specifically in Nvidia, the largest artificial intelligence-themed company. The company, known for its incredible rises recently, managed to gain more than 6% in value in the last 5 days. Nvidia has historically been a company that has been in the spotlight with its performance against Bitcoin. However, the company became even more famous as the field of artificial intelligence became popular after the boom of OpenAI.

Elon Musk Will Embrace Pi Coin, Rumor or Real?


                                Elon Musk will accept Pi Coin as a payment option                                There’s news circulating in the market. Recently, there has been a buzz around Pi Coin which has gained traction in the current trend. As a result, people connected with the community of this token are expressing various possibilities related to Pi Coin on social media platforms. In line with this, there's been speculation revolving around that billionaire businessman and owner of Platform X that is Elon Musk might accept Pi Coin as a payment option. However, it hasn't been officially disclosed on social media platforms whether Elon Musk, the owner of Platform X will accept Pi Coin as a payment option in any of his multiple businesses. Elon Musk's association with Pi Coin remains just a rumor as there has been no official statement from Musk's side and neither has the Pi Coin team confirmed the reality of such claims. Nevertheless, it's undeniable that Elon Musk is a cryptocurrency enthusiast and often seems to support Dogecoin. Regardless of how he has distanced himself from the crypto market recently and now talks less about cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Pi Coin currently has no value as its network mainnet has not yet been launched. Therefore, it seems unlikely for Musk to associate himself with a token that is not yet available for trading.Pi Coin will be the next Bitcoin, Users believeUsers of Pi Coin have been waiting for a long time for the launch of the network mainnet. They believe that in the upcoming days, as per assumptions Pi Coin could become the next Bitcoin. However, neither the open mainnet of the Pi Network has been launched nor its tokens are tradable at present. Moreover, recently several scams have surfaced in the name of Pi Coin where users were deceived into purchasing Pi Coin under pretenses.The team associated with Pi Coin has announced that the open mainnet of the network will go live on June 28th, where currently it is in a closed mainnet phase. On Comparing Pi Coin with Bitcoin, it is drawn out that the price of Bitcoin currently ranges between $62,000 and $65,000, whereas Pi Coin currently holds no value. Furthermore, until its network mainnet goes live, any speculation about this coin would be premature.Users have High Expectations with Pi CoinPi users have high hopes for Pi Coin. Currently, Pi Coin is mined through its application. Due to the network mainnet not being live, it cannot be bought or traded. Nonetheless, holders of this token are optimistic about its future. Some believe that once the Pi Network mainnet goes live, the price of Pi Coin could reach $0.50. Some users even speculate that upon listing, it could surpass the magical figure of $1. It's worth noting that the Pi Network operates on the Stellar Consensus Protocol mechanism which allows users to benefit from their contributions to the network. This is why Pi Coin has gained traction in the trend even before its network mainnet goes live.Also Read: Crypto Scams On The Rise Before Pi Network Mainnet Goes Live

CryptoQuant: Optimism May Prevail as Holders Hope for Longer Bull Market | Cryptopolitan

CryptoQuant has measured the next market mood based on a key optimism indicator. Bitcoin holders are at the peak level of optimism and now have to choose between waiting for an extended bull market or taking profits and reducing risk. Holders are now in the profit-sentiment threshold, which may set the pace for the next move of the entire crypto market.Bitcoin holders that are in the money are near peak levels, after the successful 2024 bull market. BTC still holds above $62,000 even after the recent downward pressure and has recovered well in the past week. At this stage in the market, more than 95% of all long-term buyers for BTC are in profit, barring the latest purchases at an all-time high. Even short-term buyers from the last 12 months are easily in the green.CryptoQuant suggests that the choice to hold is peak market optimism, only rarely seen during previous bull markets. The CryptoQuant analysis also shows the BTC market may be overheated. The current price level also shows BTC dominance near its higher range, at 53.6% of the entire crypto market capitalization. CryptoQuant Notes Whales Absent from ExchangesSome of the large-scale traders that usually fuel selling are absent from the market, shows additional CryptoQuant research. Whale wallets with 1,000 to 10K BTC are not depositing their funds to exchanges, instead choosing to hold. This investor behavior may indicate that the key traders are overwhelmingly optimistic and await a better time to sell, instead of realizing profits.BTC Sentiment Changes Within DaysThe latest few upswings of BTC also happen on relatively low volumes. BTC trading is now established at a baseline between $15B and $30B per day, with a rare hike to $50B. In the short term, BTC trading is still optimistic, with sentiment in the zone of “greed”. Trader behavior also shifted quickly after the recent correction, where sentiment briefly dipped to “fear”. Even during corrections, BTC remains resilient and so far liquidations are relatively low, leading to fast consolidation and recovery. Other sentiment metrics see the same situation where bullish and bearish moods are at a balance, waiting for news to tip the scales. Even a few days can make a difference, with more bullish attitudes before the latest move to $62,000.BTC sentiment in the short term changes fast, and even the smallest signs are taken into account. Bitfinex trading is one of the factors that reveals the preferences of BTC whales. The slight price premium on Bitfinex is considered a signal for a potential price bounce. BTC sentiment is still based on centralized trading. Despite the appearance of DeFi on the Bitcoin chain, the novelty factor is not enough to boost demand. BTC also commands the altcoin markets, as any downturn in BTC immediately affects other assets. Miners Show Signs of Accumulation, Keep Scarce New CoinsMiners are showing signs of confidence in Bitcoin’s future and are trying to retain coins after the latest Halving. Miner statistics shows the lowest selling since the bear market lows, when BTC traded at $16,000-$18,000. At the current price range, BTC mining is slightly profitable. Not selling to cover costs means miners can acquire and hold even more scarce new BTC with no trading or transfer history. With more heists, new BTC is becoming valuable, wince its origin can be proven. Using BTC in mainstream investments like ETF or funds also means new coins show premium demand. Network fundamentals are also much stronger and may indicate an extension of the bull market. Miners also decreased their activity in the past day, slowing down mining by 7.5%. The slowdown arrives ahead of the next difficulty calculation event, and may mean the next two weeks will have easier block production. This is yet another sign miners are attempting to get more of the 3.25 BTC block reward. Currently, miners also have increased revenues from fees, due to increased network usage. Bitcoin fees range at a usual rate of 2.88M per day, with anomalies raising daily fees to as much as 75M per day.

Bankrupt Crypto Exchange FTX Lines Up $16 Billion To Repay Creditors | Bitcoinist.com


								Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, FTX has unveiled a new repayment plan aimed at reimbursing creditors and customers in full and offering billions in the form of compensation for the time value of their investment. 
FTX To Reimburse Customers In Full
In a press release on May 7, FTX disclosed that it would be repaying 98% of its customers at least 118% of allowed claims in cash. The insolvent crypto exchange had filed a new reorganization strategy with the United States Bankruptcy Court of Delaware.
Related Reading: Dogecoin Holders In Profit across 82%, What About Shiba Inu?
The reorganization plan, which involves the allocation of funds to customers affected by FTX’s fraud scheme, will involve a centralized distribution of all of the company’s assets during the time of its collapse in November 2022 to its creditors and customers. 
The crypto exchange has revealed that it has secured between $14.5 billion to $16.3 billion, after selling assets and properties owned by the company. This specifically includes assets under control of the “Chapter 11 debtors,” the Joint Official Liquidators of FTX Digital Markets Ltd., and FTX Australia, as well as various private parties which have participated in the recovery and repayment process. 
FTX’s repayment strategy outlines a comprehensive approach to repay creditors, both governmental and non-governmental. The crypto exchange has stated that it will make complete payments to non-governmental creditors based on the value of their claims determined by the Bankruptcy Court. 
On the other hand, a subordination arrangement is proposed for governmental creditors, prioritizing interest payments to primary classes of customers and creditors at up to 9%, executed in a timely manner. 
The repayment plan will also establish a unique category known as “convenience class,” specifically focusing on creditors with claims valued at $50,000 or less. This reorganization will effectively streamline the payment process for smaller creditors and expedite compensation. 
The exchange’s amended repayment strategy is still undergoing finalization and awaiting approval from the Bankruptcy Court. However, if the plan receives approval, it is expected that creditors will receive 118% of the value of their allowed claims within 60 days following the plan’s effective date. 
Key Settlements In Repayment Plan
In its new payment reorganization plan, FTX disclosed several settlements mutually agreed upon with primary economic stakeholders. As well as some that are still pending finalization and approval by the Court. 

One of the key settlements involves a resolution of the $24 billion in claims filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In exchange, FTX has agreed to make a $200 million cash payment and issue a $685 million subordinate claim. 
Additionally, FTX has proposed agreements with the IRS and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to subordinate tax claims which arose after the commencement of the Chapter 11 cases. Furthermore, the crypto exchange revealed a previously approved settlement with the Joint Official Liquidators of FTX Digital Markets, Ltd., and BlockFi, the largest creditor of FTX.

Is It Time To Invest In Altcoins? According to Santiment Data, These Two Altcoins Are in the Buy Zone! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While Bitcoin has been in a downward trend since approaching $65,500 at the beginning of the week, altcoins are also keeping up with the downward trend.
At this point, the decline in BTC and altcoin prices offers an opportunity to investors who want to buy at bottom prices. Because, according to the data, BTC and some altcoins are giving a buy signal.


Popular on-chain platform Santiment said in its post that, according to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bitcoin and some popular altcoins look extremely cheap and are in the buy zone.
Accordingly, Santiment data shows that the RSI indicator for Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), BNB, Solana (SOL), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Toncoin (TON), Cardano (ADA), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Avalanche (AVAX) is falling. .





RSI level is 41.3 on BTC; 41.5 in ETH; 44.8 in BNB; 48.7 in SOL; 46 in XRP; 49 in DOGE; 55.1 in TON; 42.6 on AVAX; It measured 38.4 in SHIB and 32.3 in ADA.

“According to the Relative Strength Index, the majority of top cryptocurrencies are in slightly overbought zones.
The popular indicator RSI, widely used in technical analysis; “It shows that Cardano is a potential buy candidate with the lowest RSI.”

What is the RSI Indicator, How to Read It?
RSI, expressed as Relative Strength Index, is among the most frequently used technical indicators in predicting the direction in which the price will move.


It is calculated by taking the highest and lowest levels of the price of the asset you follow on the chart according to the period you specify.
If the RSI value between 0 and 100 is above 70, it is in the overbought zone; If it is below 30, it indicates an oversold area.





When the RSI indicator reaches the overbought and oversold zones, it signals that the price will move in the opposite direction. If the RSI exceeds the 70 level and moves towards the 80-100 range, which is the critical region, the RSI signals that the price has risen too much and a correction will occur as soon as possible. On the other hand, if the RSI has fallen below the 30 level and moved towards the 20-0 range, the signal signals that the trend will change and the price will rise.

This AI Token Becomes the Most Trending in the Crypto Industry: Details


																TL;DR

An AI-related cryptocurrency has recently excelled in social volume dominance, outperforming its rivals, including the sector’s leader.
Its value has surged by 435% in the past year, bolstered by major exchange support among other reasons.


RNDR Tops the Ranking
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrencies related to that evolving technology have been making great strides as of late. One such token capturing the attention of many industry participants is Render (RNDR).
It has a market capitalization of almost $4 billion, making it the second-largest in the cohort. The current leader is Fetch.ai (FET) with a market cap of over $5.5 billion.
However, the market intelligence platform Santiment claimed that RNDR has outperformed its rival and all other cryptocurrencies on one important front: social volume dominance. 




The entity estimated that the AI cryptocurrency has been at the center of most discussions in the past few days, with a rate of more than 100%.
Other assets performing quite well in that matter are AIOZ Network (AIOZ), Turbo (TURBO), Cirus (CIRUS), and Deri Protocol (DERI).

RNDR’s Price Rally
RNDR is the native token of the Render Network Foundation, a leading provider of decentralized GPU solutions that aims to revolutionize the digital creation process. Earlier this year, it caught the eye of Coinbase, which placed it on its roadmap zone and later allowed trading services with it.
The support from the aforementioned exchange might be one factor contributing to RNDR’s exponential price increase in the past year. Its current value stands at over $10, representing a whopping 435% increase compared to the figures observed in May 2023.

Tesla Shares Dip as US Prosecutors Focus on Potential Securities and Wire Fraud - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



U.S. prosecutors are reportedly investigating Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) for potential securities and wire fraud related to its electric vehicles’ self-driving capabilities. The probe, which involves the company’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems, aims to determine whether Tesla misled investors about the true abilities of these features. Despite public statements by Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, suggesting that the cars can drive themselves, the systems are not fully autonomous and require drivers to remain engaged.



Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Systems Under Scrutiny



The investigation focuses on Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems, which provide assistance with steering, braking, and lane changes but do not offer complete autonomy. Prosecutors are examining whether Tesla committed securities fraud by making false or misleading statements to investors about the capabilities of these systems.



Additionally, the probe covers allegations of wire fraud involving deceptive communications regarding the driver-assistance features. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is also investigating Tesla’s representations of these systems to investors.





Broader Criticism of Tesla’s Practices



Beyond the current investigation, Tesla has faced criticism on various fronts. The company has been accused of fostering a problematic workplace culture, engaging in questionable business practices, and neglecting safety and occupational hazards.



Critics have alleged that Tesla has employed deceptive marketing tactics, made unfulfilled promises, and engaged in fraudulent activities, particularly concerning its self-driving technology and sustainability claims. Reports and lawsuits related to sudden unintended acceleration, brake failures, and vehicle quality issues have also emerged. Moreover, Tesla’s relationships with employees and unions have been strained, with reports of high turnover, poor treatment, and anti-union activities.



The company has also faced accusations of environmental misconduct, inappropriate use of cryptocurrencies, and non-compliance with open-source licenses.



TSLA Slides in Premarket



As the investigation into Tesla’s self-driving systems continues, the company’s stock price has experienced a decline.



As of the latest update, Tesla’s stock closed at $177.81, representing a decrease of $6.95 or -3.76%. In pre-market trading, the price was listed at $172.00, down by $5.81 or -3.27%.



The outcome of the ongoing probe into Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems, as well as the broader criticisms faced by the company, could have significant implications for its reputation, investor confidence, and prospects in the highly competitive electric vehicle market.







Do you think Tesla can turn around its stock price? Let us know in the comments below.

Mastercard Joins Citi and JPMorgan to Test DLT Settlements | Coinspeaker



The trial will see companies such as BNY Mellon, Broadridge, the DTCC, ISDA, and Tassat Group serve as project contributors, providing their expertise for it.

Mastercard, an American multinational payments company, said it has joined other prominent banks in the country to participate in a trial involving distributed ledger technology (DLT) to explore the potential for settling transactions.
According to a Bloomberg report on Wednesday, Mastercard, Citi, and JPMorgan will test a shared-ledger system that allows for the settlement of tokenized assets such as wholesale central bank money, US Treasuries, and investment-grade debt securities.




Assessing Cross-Border Transactions with RSN
The trial is part of the Regulated Settlement Network (RSN) program, which involves using its proof-of-concept (PoC) mechanism to simulate transactions in US dollars.
The main objective of the trial is to assess whether settling transactions on a common, regulated platform, following existing laws, can make cross-border transactions in USD faster, easier, and more secure. Ultimately, the aim is to reduce the risk of errors and fraud in the settlement process.
Raj Dhamodharan, a senior blockchain executive at Mastercard, acknowledged the importance of companies coming together to explore how blockchain can provide solutions to real-world challenges.
He also added that the successful completion of the trial could bring about the launch of innovative solutions and other financial infrastructure to the market to enable easy financial settlements.
“The application of shared ledger technology to dollar settlements could unlock the next generation of market infrastructures – where programmable settlements are 24/7 and frictionless,” he said.
Additional Players in the DLT Settlement Trial
In addition to Mastercard, Citi, and JPMorgan, other companies such as Bancorp, Wells Fargo & Co., Visa Inc., Swift, TD Bank NA, and Zions Bancorp will participate in the new trial. Approximately ten financial services firms in the United States have been chosen for the experiment.
The trial will see companies such as BNY Mellon, Broadridge, the DTCC, ISDA, and Tassat Group serve as project contributors, providing their expertise for it. Other financial institutions, such as the New York Innovation Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, will observe the participants’ research and experimentation with tokenized settlement assets.
Advancing the DLT Settlement Trial with SIFMA
Per the Bloomberg report, the new trial is an extension of a 12-week test conducted in 2022. The previous experiment dubbed the Regulated Liability Network (RLN), specifically targeted domestic interbank payments and cross-border transactions involving US dollar denominations.
Like the previous pilot, the new initiative will be managed and controlled by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA).
In a separate statement, Charles de Simone, the Managing Director at SIFMA, said the experiment aims to find new advancements involving digital versions of US dollars and securities as market participants strive to develop solutions that improve capital markets’ efficiency and resilience.

Indonesia Sets up Crypto Committee to Oversee Industry Operations


							

Bappebti, Indonesia’s regulatory agency, forms a committee to monitor the crypto sector.



Crypto Asset Committee ensures compliance and advises on trading.



Kasan stressed the importance of the Crypto Asset Committee.




Indonesia Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency, Bappebti, has set up a special committee to monitor the country’s growing cryptocurrency sector. Plt. Head of CoFTRA Kasan disclosed this information during the inauguration of the 2024 Crypto Literacy Month (BLK) event at Thamrin Nine Ballroom in Jakarta on Thursday, May 2nd.



According to Kasan’s statement during the event, “This committee will be a driving force, ensuring that the crypto asset industry continues to operate smoothly and remains within the applicable legal framework. Therefore, optimizing the role of the Crypto Asset Committee should be a key focus in implementing the current crypto asset ecosystem.”



The Crypto Asset Committee comprises various stakeholders, including officials from Bappebti and relevant government ministries and institutions. It also encompassed representatives from crypto asset exchanges, clearing institutions, and academic and practitioner associations within the crypto asset space. 



Meanwhile, Kasan stressed that the establishment of the Crypto Asset Committee aligns with regulations introduced in January. He further added that it is mandated under Article 4, paragraph (1) of CoFTRA Regulation Number 8 of 2021 regarding “Guidelines for Organizing Physical Market Trading of Crypto Assets (Crypto Assets) on the Futures Exchange.”

With industry expert predictions cheering Bitcoin prices to reach astronomical amounts, users and investors must prepare and execute a good custody plan.Bitcoin (BTC) remains a hot topic of discussion with growing institutional interest and multiple spot BTC ETFs approved, allowing traditional investment firms to offer Bitcoin to their clients. Users own Bitcoin or obtain exposure to this asset class in multiple ways, from investing in ETFs to holding them via centralized exchanges or exploring self-custody options either directly or via institutions or third parties. Individuals need to choose the right custody solution that best suits their custodial risk appetite along with their investment and regulatory profile. They broadly have the following options when it comes to holding their Bitcoin:                                                                    Bitcoin holdings in centralized exchanges                                        Centralized exchanges are considered a gateway into cryptocurrencies for retail investors, and it’s no surprise that some users might consider them a convenient option to hold their Bitcoin.Reputable centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken operate to high standards owing to their jurisdictions and regulatory and legal compliance. Retail users drawn to cryptocurrencies tend to start their journeys by opening their first accounts on centralized exchanges. These institutions can onboard users after necessary Know Your Customer (KYC) checks and offer easy on-ramp solutions to facilitate cryptocurrency purchases via fiat currencies. The users who appreciate the centralized exchange experience can potentially leave their Bitcoin holdings on their exchange accounts, making the chosen crypto exchange their default custody provider. The option does have some downsides, and users should become familiar with the risks of this approach, which can include the complete loss of assets due to hacking or exchange insolvency.                                                                    Bitcoin self-custody options                                        Bitcoin self-custody represents scenarios where users take full accountability and ownership of the BTC they own, which comes with its own pros and cons. The critical aspect of self-custody is safeguarding the private key that controls user wallets.For sophisticated users who believe in the popular maxim of “not your keys, not your crypto” within the cryptocurrency ecosystem and are willing to put in some extra effort to set up self-custodial options, here are some potential approaches:Private hot walletsPrivate hot wallets range from mobile to desktop solutions where users can set up a wallet and safeguard the private key to control assets within that wallet. These are usually termed hot wallets as they stay connected to the internet and can interact with multiple decentralized applications (DApps) to perform regular transactions. However, it’s not wise to store a significant amount of BTC in hot wallets.Private hardware walletsHardware wallets are usually considered cold wallets, as they only interact with external applications when required. Security-conscious users can benefit greatly from using a hardware wallet as a cold storage solution for their Bitcoin. Cold storage wallets potentially help users avoid malicious contracts, hacks or social engineering attempts.                                                                    Bitcoin self-custody security measures                                        Users who opt for self-custodial options must ensure best practices are followed to safeguard their assets.Private key storageFor users with private wallets, their private key is the only way to control assets tied to their address. They must protect it at all costs and avoid exposing it to unknown parties. As a private key record is essential, it should not be stored by users on their devices or computers as plain text, as this exposes them in the event of a security breach. Paper wallets offer a simple start for secure key storage, but consider durable metal solutions for ultimate protection. These specialize in engraving users’ private keys or seed phrases onto fire-and-flood-resistant metal, ensuring your crypto assets are protected for the long haul.Multisig walletsMultisignature wallets offer an additional layer of protection where multiple individuals would need to sign a transaction to move any Bitcoin within the underlying wallets. These are standard measures in cryptocurrency project treasuries or decentralized autonomous organizations DAOs to protect against a single wallet or individual compromise. Still, they can be adopted by security-conscious retail users who can draft in families and friends to provide an additional layer of safety.Custodial institutions and third partiesFor organizations and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), relying on reputable third parties to safeguard their assets is a sensible approach that would meet many of their regulatory and compliance commitments. Custodial services for digital assets mirror existing stocks, precious metals and art models.Reputable institutions like Coinbase and BitGo offer digital assets custody solutions. These entities are certified as custodial institutions under the laws and regulations of their incorporated jurisdictions. They adhere to very high standards in terms of security measures, insurance, audits and compliance that would satisfy the requirements of institutional investors and HNWIs.These custodial solutions have a gamut of physical security, cold storage, operational security workflows and access controls to safeguard the Bitcoin entrusted to them. They can also regularly provide users with clear reporting and holdings status to maintain high transparency levels.Ownership, jurisdiction and tax efficient structuresOwnership jurisdiction and holding structures can significantly impact one’s cryptocurrency custody choices. Considering these factors alongside the technical aspects of custody is essential to ensure your assets are secure and legally compliant.Global institutions holding Bitcoin are sometimes complex legal entities when it comes to their jurisdictions and holding companies. Similarly, family offices or HNWIs can opt to hold BTC via holding companies or trusts in different jurisdictions, which would impact the potential custodial solutions available to them. These structures are predominantly driven by privacy and tax efficiency benefits; however, users must ensure that their chosen custody options are legal and compliant by seeking appropriate advice from financial and legal experts.

FCA crypto regulators will take the best from TradFi and DeFi, says exec

When it comes to regulating cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), financial authorities in the United Kingdom aim to take the best of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), according to an executive at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).The cryptocurrency community and regulators have been long considering the best approach to regulating the crypto market, raising concerns about over-regulating or under-regulating it.According to FCA director of payments and digital assets Matthew Long, the right way to regulate the industry is to combine different approaches and see which one works best.“What we’re trying to do is take the best of traditional finance and understand the nuance of the system that we've got,” Long said at a panel discussion at the FT Crypto and Digital Assets Summit on May 8.FCA director of payments and digital assets, Matthew Long (left), and Digital Asset co-founder Yuval Rooz. Source: FT Live“The simplest and most straightforward answer is that they [FCA] are trying to take the best of traditional finance, so it’s the same risk, same regulation and not reinvent the wheel,” the FCA director of digital assets noted, adding:“But we must and we absolutely must respond to the differences in cross border globalization otherwise. So to be frank, it's a bit of both.”Long mentioned he has seen many things that the FCA thought were relatively straightforward and eventually are “definitely not.” And on the other hand, there are things that were expected to face a lot of opposition, but it eventually worked.FT Crypto and Digital Assets Summit’s panel on regulating crypto and digital assets. Source: CointelegraphDuring the panel, the FCA executive also mentioned harm in both centralized finance (CeFi) and DeFi, stressing that many authorities around the world already have tools to challenge money laundering in CeFi. According to Long, the FCA is exploring opportunities to keep good actors in the crypto industry while making it “cleaner, safer and better.”Related: Revolut debuts dedicated crypto exchange for UK usersIn recent years, the U.K. has become a significant player in the crypto economy, attracting considerable attention from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).In August 2023, the FCA reported that the authority had approved the registrations of 38 crypto firms since 2020, out of a total of 300 applications. The FCA has also been actively working on increasing its capabilities in detecting and combating crypto market abuse and preventing the industry from placing illegal crypto ads.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

Mastercard joins forces with US banking titans for tokenized settlement trials

Payment processing and settlement firm Mastercard has joined hands with major banking institutions in the United States, such as Citigroup, Visa and JPMorgan, to test the use of distributed ledger technology for banking settlements using tokenization.The partnership between the banking giants and the payment processor aims to test shared-ledger technology called Regulated Settlement Network (RSN). RSN enables tokenized assets like Treasury, investment-grade debt instruments, and money from commercial banks to be settled collectively. Currently, securities like investment-grade debt and assets like money from commercial banks function on different systems. Using RSN, settlement procedures will occur on a single platform by converting various assets into tokens and settling them on a distributed ledger. The current phase of trials expands on a 12-week pilot phase that started in late 2022. The test was earlier focused on cross-border and domestic dollar payments between banks. The ongoing proof-of-concept (PoC) RSN trials are focused on simulating settlements in the United States dollar.In a statement on May 8, Mastercard said the project is focused on increasing the efficiency of cross-border settlements and reducing the chance of error and fraud. Raj Dhamodharan, Head of Blockchain and Digital Assets at Mastercard, said that the “application of shared ledger technology to dollar settlements could unlock the next generation of market infrastructures — where programmable settlements are 24/7 and frictionless.” Related: Visa and Mastercard: A boon for wallet holders, a threat to crypto exchanges?The RSN PoC has seen two significant additions to the participating banking institutions: interbank tokenized deposit networks — USDF Consortium will be a direct participant, and the Tassat Group will be a contributor. Another banking giant, Deloitte, provides advisory services. The program manager will be the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA). There are a total of 10 participant banking giants, namely Citi, JPMorgan, Mastercard, Swift, TD Bank N.A., U.S. Bank, USDF, Wells Fargo, Visa, and Zions Bancorp. Six more project participants will offer their subject-matter expertise. These include the nonprofit MITRE Corporation, BNY Mellon, Broadridge, the DTCC, ISDA, and Tassat Group.Magazine: Crypto in the Philippines: Necessity is the mother of adoption

The Best Quantum Computing Strategies Piggyback on Recursive STARKs - Buterin


							

Vitalik Buterin believes all of the best strategies for quantum-proofing piggyback on recursive STARKs.



Buterin noted that the best thing to do is to keep working hard on good and efficient STARK protocols.



The Ethereum co-founder has been creating quantum-resistant account abstracted wallet codes since 2017.




Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes all of the best strategies for quantum-proofing piggyback on recursive STARKs. In a recent post on X, Buterin noted that the best thing to do is to keep working hard on good and efficient STARK protocols.







According to Buterin, he has been creating quantum-resistant account abstracted wallet codes since 2017. He thinks that by building efficient STARK protocols, blockchain developers can build signature aggregation with the protocols as the foundation.



The Ethereum creator further highlighted that with a ten to twenty years timeline on quantum computing, the right thing to do would be to immediately start working on the basic infrastructure, which he considers recursive STARK protocols. In addition, Buterin suggested that the blockchain industry ensures decisions made currently are forward-compatible with a quantum-resistant future.



Meanwhile, Buterin cited a protocol on Github with the code 4337, noting that it is forward-compatible with quantum-resistance in more ways than one. He highlighted that the protocol’s aggregation feature is optional for now. However, given the higher base overhead of hash-based signatures, he suspects it will become essential.









Buterin’s post was in response to Gregory Markou, ChainSafe’s co-founder, who prompted a discussion on the 3074 competitor, EIP-7702, authored by Buterin. Markou considered the spec good, noting that it addresses an essential hurdle of 3074, assumed as the special signing requirements.



Nonetheless, Markou did not agree to using quantum computing as a counter-argument. He believes many people have repeatedly used it without proposing a solution forward. He cited James Prestwich, the co-founder of Nomad, who said that if quantum computing is an actual concern instead of a political blocker, then there is a need for some extreme actions already.

FTX To Pay Back Customers In Full, With Interest, As It Amasses Billions In Cash: 'This Is Just An Unbelievable Result,' Says CEO - Benzinga

FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, has accumulated a substantial cash reserve, allowing it to fully reimburse its customers.What Happened: FTX has amassed more than enough cash to cover the losses incurred by its customers during its collapse in November 2022, reported Bloomberg. The company, now under the leadership of CEO John Ray, is set to distribute as much as $16.3 billion in cash among its creditors, which amounts to about $5.3 billion more than what is owed."In any bankruptcy, this is just an unbelievable result," said Ray.FTX’s plan includes paying interest to its 2 million customers, a rare outcome in U.S. bankruptcies where creditors typically receive only a fraction of their claims. The company’s assets, once fully sold, will leave no surplus for equity holders, according to court documents filed in Delaware, where the case is being handled.FTX’s creditors, depending on the type of claim they hold, could recover as much as 142% of their claims. The majority of customers are expected to receive 118% of their FTX platform holdings on the day the company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy.See Also: Trader Who Made ‘Giga Wealth’ On Memes Reveals ‘Mememillions Playbook,’ Still Holds Most Of His DOGEThe company, now managed by restructuring advisers, has also proposed setting up a fund to compensate some creditors, including those who lent FTX crypto, with money that would have otherwise gone to government regulators.Why It Matters: This development marks a significant turnaround for FTX, which was previously facing a dire financial situation. The company’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years for his involvement in an $8 billion fraud, and the company was forced to liquidate his $222 million worth of real estate to compensate creditors.However, the company’s fortunes began to change when it ramped up its cash reserves in an attempt to repay customers amid bankruptcy. FTX’s affiliates, including FTX Trading Ltd. and Alameda Research LLC, significantly increased the group’s cash to $4.4 billion by the end of 2023, a substantial rise from the $2.3 billion recorded in late October. The company raised $1.8 billion through selling some digital assets as of Dec 8, according to the report.Read Next: If You’re Getting Tired Of Crypto, Here’s Why: Mad Crypto Alpha With IvanImage Via Shutterstock Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh BagalkoteThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

FTX customers will get back all the money they lost in collapse

FTX co-founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in the exchange’s collapse.Photo: Michael M. Santiago (Getty Images)Nearly all of FTX’s former customers will get back almost 100% of the money they lost at the time of the cryptocurrency exchange’s collapse — if not more.Robinhood denies SEC claim of violating securities lawsFTX said in a statement Tuesday that it expects 98% of its creditors to receive approximately 118% of the amount of their allowed claims. Others will receive 100% of their claims plus billions in interest as compensation for the time value of their investments.The company forecasts that the total value of the assets, converted to cash and made available for distribution, will be between $14.5 and $16.3 billion. The updated reorganization plan, as outlined in filings in Delaware bankruptcy court submitted Tuesday, will be funded from cash that the company has on hand, available NFTs, wind-down cash proceeds, and any remaining assets.Shareholders’ claims will be calculated based on their holdings as of November 2022, when the crypto exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The announcement was likely welcomed by former customers, whose money was locked up amid court proceedings. At the time of the collapse, it was believed that billions of dollars worth of customer deposits in FTX would likely never be recovered.Sam Bankman-Fried, who co-founded the crypto exchange in 2019 and became known as the “Crypto King,” was convicted of fraud last year in FTX’s stunning collapse. He was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison.The new reorganization plan is pending finalization and approval from the bankruptcy court. Customers should expect to begin receiving their money within 60 days of the plan’s effective date, which will be set by the court.“We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,” said John J. Ray III, CEO and chief restructuring officer of FTX. He also thanked FTX’s customers and creditors for their patience throughout the 17-month-long process.

Hong Kong Shuts Down AI-Enabled Crypto Scam Claiming Ties to Elon Musk | Cryptoglobe


                                
Earlier today, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) took decisive action against Quantum AI, an unlicensed cryptocurrency exchange that falsely claimed affiliation with Tesla CEO and Dogecoin ($DOGE) advocate Elon Musk. The fraudulent entity, based in Hong Kong, purported to offer AI-powered crypto trading services developed by Musk himself.



According to a report by Cointelegraph, in a brazen attempt to deceive potential investors, Quantum AI displayed AI-generated videos and images of Elon Musk on its website and social media profiles, suggesting a direct connection between the billionaire entrepreneur and the exchange’s trading technology. The SFC also suspected that Quantum AI had been spreading false and misleading information about itself through an undisclosed news website, promising “too-good-to-be-true” returns to lure unsuspecting crypto enthusiasts in Hong Kong.



The HKSFC swiftly responded to the fraudulent activities by issuing a warning against Quantum AI and directing the Hong Kong police to block the exchange’s website and remove all associated social media pages. This decisive move comes as part of Hong Kong’s ongoing efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry and protect investors from unscrupulous actors.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

In an alert published on its website, the SFC had this warning about Quantum AI:



“The entity purports to provide cryptocurrency trading service with its underlying artificial intelligence (AI) technology. It operates at the above websites and is suspected of engaging in virtual asset related fraudulent activities. The entity is suspected of using AI-generated deepfake videos and photos of Mr Elon Musk on its website and through social media to deceive the public that Mr Musk is the developer of the entity’s underlying technology.



“The entity is also suspected of using a ‘news’ website to disseminate false and misleading information about itself and promote its cryptocurrency trading services to the Hong Kong public. It claims on the “news” website that the Hong Kong public has been using its technology to trade in cryptocurrencies and is able to earn “too-good-to-be-true” returns.“



Per Cointelegraph’s report, as of February, the HKSFC had received license applications from 23 crypto exchanges seeking to operate legally in Hong Kong. The regulator has since stopped accepting new applications and has instructed all unlicensed entities to cease operations by the end of May. This crackdown on unlicensed exchanges aims to create a more transparent and trustworthy environment for crypto investors in the region.

Could Bitcoin Spot ETFs Open to China's 1.4 Billion Population? There Are Some Claims - Bitcoin Sistemi


China's relationship with Bitcoin has been a bumpy ride marked by bans and crackdowns.
However, contrary to popular belief, the ban was not absolute. Bitcoin has managed to maintain its presence in the country despite these regulatory challenges. Moreover, China is actively working on exploring blockchain technology, as evidenced by initiatives such as digital yuan and Web3 development plans.


SyzCapital's Managing Partner, Richard Byworth, hinted at a potential development. Byworth said in his statement:

“There is talk that Hong Kong Bitcoin Spot ETFs could be added to equity tie-ups. The implications of this are absolutely massive (basically meaning mainland Chinese capital could buy them).”


SmashFi Co-Founder and COO Brian HoonJong Paik echoed Byworth's views, saying that alternative investment opportunities are needed in China. Emphasizing that a significant portion of Chinese wealth is tied to real estate, Paik suggested that BTC could serve as a tool to diversify investment portfolios and stabilize the socio-economic landscape:






“It's just a matter of time. 70% of China's wealth is in real estate and there are currently 100 million empty homes. The CCP needs an alternative presence to reduce social unrest.”

Nigeria Threatens Crypto Knockout: P2P Ban Looms In Fintech Feud


								Nigeria’s once-tepid stance on cryptocurrency has taken a sharp turn towards prohibition. The Nigerian government, citing concerns over Naira manipulation, is proposing a ban on P2P (Peer-to-Peer) trading platforms that utilize the local currency. This move, coupled with ongoing legal battles with major exchanges, throws the future of Nigerian crypto into uncertainty.

Naira Under Siege? The P2P Battleground
The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleges that crypto participants and exchanges are manipulating the Naira’s value through P2P transactions. Emomotimi Agama, the newly appointed Director-General, suggests delisting the Naira from all P2P platforms as a remedy.
Agama highlighted the government’s resolve to combat the perceived threat, saying:

“This is one of the things we must do to save this space.”

The potential P2P ban would significantly restrict Nigerian crypto investors. P2P platforms offer a convenient and often cheaper way to buy and sell crypto using local currency compared to traditional exchange channels. With the Naira delisted, Nigerians would face hurdles in entering and exiting the crypto market, potentially hindering its growth and adoption.
Crypto Exchanges Feeling The Heat
The regulatory heat isn’t just scorching P2P platforms. Leading crypto exchange Binance, already embroiled in a months-long tussle with the Nigerian government, felt the brunt early on.
In March, Binance suspended all Naira-related services following the arrest of two executives and accusations of flouting regulations. The saga continues – Binance faces criminal charges, and its executives are entangled in a separate tax evasion battle with the Nigerian authorities.

Total crypto market cap at $2.23 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView.com
Following Binance’s lead, OKX, another major crypto exchange, delisted the Naira from its P2P marketplace on May 3rd. While OKX didn’t explicitly cite regulatory pressure, their explanation of a “change in local market requirements” suggests a cautious approach in the face of Nigeria’s tightening grip.
Unanswered Questions And Uncertain Future
The effectiveness of a P2P ban in curbing alleged manipulation remains to be seen. Crypto by its nature transcends borders, and Nigerians could potentially turn to international P2P platforms or alternative methods to circumvent restrictions. Additionally, the details of the proposed broader regulations targeting the local crypto industry are yet to be revealed.

The situation paints a bleak picture for Nigerian crypto enthusiasts. Local investors face limited options, major exchanges are wary of operating in the country, and the regulatory landscape remains opaque. While the government seeks to exert control, this clampdown might stifle innovation and push Nigerians towards unregulated avenues within the crypto space.
What Lies Ahead
Nigeria’s move against crypto P2P platforms is a significant development with potential ripple effects across Africa’s burgeoning crypto market. Whether the government’s concerns translate into effective regulations or stifle a burgeoning industry altogether remains to be seen. In the meantime, Nigerian crypto investors are left navigating a landscape fraught with uncertainty.

Eurojust Leads €6M Cryptocurrency Scam Bust in Austria - DailyCoin


        
Eurojust has coordinated a big crypto scam bust.



The fraud scheme was operational for nearly three months.



Multiple suspects were arrested, and millions of assets were seized following the bust.
The European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) has led authorities from three countries to bust an Austria-based online crypto fraud scheme believed to have scammed users of millions of euros.Terming it an exit scam, Eurojust said the collapsed scheme was operational between December 2017 and February 2018. During this time, the perpetrators lured unsuspecting victims into buying a dubious cryptocurrency touted as a newly launched digital asset via a fake company website.Nabbing the SuspectsAfter “exiting” the scam in February 2018, the Austrian-based fraudsters went dark by deleting their social media accounts and taking the fake company’s homepage offline.
“This so-called exit scam made it clear to investors that they had been conned. They lost around EUR 6 million. Not all victims of the fraud have been identified at this stage,” Eurojust said in a statement Wednesday.This prompted authorities to launch a manhunt for the scammers, which finally resulted in the arrest of six main suspects and the seizure of two cars, EUR 750,000 in assets, and property worth EUR 1.4 million on May 8.Per the statement, the bust was a collaborative effort of multiple authorities, including Europol, Cyprus Police, the Czech Republic’s National Organised Crime Agency, and Austria’s Central Public Prosecutor’s Office for Combatting Economic Crimes and Corruption.“Eurojust supported the action day against the online scam with a coordination centre, enabling real-time communication between all the authorities involved. This also enabled the rapid execution of European Arrest Warrants and search warrants,” the statement read.Eurojust did not clarify the next action against the arrested suspects or seized assets.

Swing Voters Divided on Crypto's Role in Fixing Outdated Financial System, Survey Reveals


							

Majority of swing voters see the current financial system as outdated and favouring elites.



Only a third of respondents believe cryptocurrency could solve financial system problems.



Crypto owners express more optimism about its impact on financial well-being compared to non-owners.




Swing Voters Skeptical of Crypto’s Potential to Solve Financial System Woes, Survey Finds  A recent survey conducted in six swing states reveals that while a majority of voters view the current financial system as outdated and in need of an overhaul, they are divided on whether cryptocurrency offers a viable solution.







Source:DCGHarrisPoll



According to the study conducted by the Digital Currency Group and The Harris Group, 70% of surveyed swing voters agree that the existing financial system favors elites over regular people, indicating a widespread dissatisfaction with the status quo.



However, despite this dissatisfaction there are only a third of respondents who believe that cryptocurrency could address these systemic issues. Additionally, nearly three-quarters of participants express skepticism that crypto offers a more equitable alternative to the current financial system.



Interestingly there is a divergence in opinions between current crypto owners and those who have never invested in digital assets. While over 90% of crypto owners plan to either increase their holdings or maintain their portfolios in the next six months only a small fraction of non-crypto owners intend to invest in the asset class.









A majority (76%) of voters who have experience with cryptocurrency report that it has positively impacted their financial well-being highlighting a potential divide in perception based on personal experience.



Despite growing interest and investment in cryptocurrency the survey suggests that educational and perception still barriers remain among swing voters. Many candidates expressed skepticism towards political candidates who fail to grasp the intricacies of blockchain technology and its potential implications on the financial landscape.

Empire Newsletter: FTX bankruptcy almost across the finish line - Blockworks


End in sight
There’s some good news for creditors in the joint reorganization plan filed late Tuesday by FTX’s bankruptcy overseers.
FTX says it has collected between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion in cash, and it’s ready to distribute those funds to creditors. It owes customers and other creditors around $11 billion. FTX says that 98% of its non-government creditors will receive “at least” 118% of claims in cash within two months of the plan being approved. 
Some, including crypto loan creditors, could see up to 142% of their claims paid back, according to a court filing. 
Others can expect to be paid in full and receive interest on their claims. 
But don’t get too excited just yet. The plan still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court. While it seems to check all of the boxes on paper, one should expect this process to take a while to play out. 
Further, creditors shouldn’t expect to see their claims benefit from the recent crypto boom. Instead, the claims will be paid out according to November 2022 prices. Bitcoin hovered around $20,000 back then —  a far cry from its current level of $62,000. 
But that shouldn’t be a surprise after the judge said earlier this year that the bankruptcy code is “very clear” and that FTX doesn’t meet the criteria for an exception.
A press release about the new plan explained that debtors reached a series of settlements, including the IRS claims, an agreement with the CFTC, and a separate agreement with the DOJ.
The hope, according to the estate, is to resolve disputes “without costly and protracted litigation.” That’s something, I think, everyone can agree on. 
Much of the funds came from the sales of Alameda and FTX Ventures investments, including the firm’s stake in Anthropic, which was approved for sale earlier this year. The estate also sold out of its position in Grayscale’s bitcoin ETF. 
CEO John J. Ray, who took over from the now incarcerated Sam Bankman-Fried, expressed his optimism about the proposed plan, saying that the firm was “pleased” to be able to pay back creditors. 
While there’s no denying that this plan is good news for creditors, the debtors previously teased that they had enough to pay people back. FTX lawyer Andrew Dietderich said in January that it expected to repay creditors in full “eventually.”
According to the bankruptcy docket, the court scheduled two hearings for later this summer. 
Approval of the plan could represent one of the final steps in the closure of the FTX saga since Bankman-Fried was sentenced earlier this year after being found guilty of fraud.

It’s been a long journey since Ray took over nearly two years ago and said the bankruptcy represented an “unprecedented” mess. (That, coming from the guy who took over Enron’s bankruptcy, says a lot.) 
Soon we can officially put FTX in the rearview mirror.

Grayscale’s bitcoin ETF once again saw outflows Tuesday, with $28 million departing the fund.
ARK offloaded $15 million worth of Coinbase shares from three funds.
Over the past 24 hours, $27 million of shorts have been liquidated, per CoinGlass data.
Bitcoin continues to slip from its local Monday highs, trading around $62,250 as of press time.
Ether, too, is showcasing some near-term weakness as well, trading just below $3,000 this morning, or about 2.4% off in the past day. 

Where in the world is Binance?
Binance has a checkered past when it comes to getting along with countries and regulators. 
The exchange still struggles with this today, as countries like Nigeria and the Philippines either move to block the exchange from operating or — in Nigeria’s case — detain executives and charge them with the same crimes as their employer. 
Speaking of Nigeria, Binance stopped support for the naira as it continues to fight for the country to release Tigran Gambaryan, one of the aforementioned detained executives.
Binance’s own website claims that it’s available in over 100 countries. However, it only lists 44 countries. Binance didn’t return my multiple requests for comment on the discrepancy. 
Here’s a fun little note: Binance’s site says it supports 19 European countries but lists Europe as one of those countries, alongside others like the Czech Republic and France. 
Despite the multibillion-dollar settlement Binance agreed to pay the US government last year, operations in the US remain a sticky situation. Investors in the States — well, really, just certain states — can use the platform. Unfortunately, if you’re based in a handful of states, including my home state of Texas, you’re unable to use the US platform. 
The exchange exited the Canadian market last year, citing regulatory concerns. Those worries didn’t seem to faze Coinbase, though, which received registration as a restricted dealer last month.
Binance is also blocked in China after the country took action against crypto a few years back. It ceased operations in South Korea back in 2020, citing low usage and volume. 
Over in Europe, Binance left the Netherlands last year and withdrew its application for a crypto license in Germany. But the firm still operates in France and is available in other European countries including Spain. 
The exchange did admit that French authorities made an on-site visit in June of last year, claiming that it was “fully collaborative” with said authorities.
According to a February report from Bloomberg, Binance is still trying to re-enter the UK market, but the company continues to face regulatory hurdles.
Oh, and did I mention that the company still doesn’t have a headquarters? Though new CEO Richard Teng did say — at Paris Blockchain Week — that the company was mulling a “few jurisdictions.”
Stay tuned.

The Morning Riff
Turns out Gary Gensler’s not the biggest fan of crypto journalism.
The SEC Chair grew a bit frustrated yesterday during an interview with CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin over the latter’s questioning on crypto. 
Crypto, Gensler stressed, is “a small piece of our overall markets” but “an outsized piece of the scams and frauds and problems in our markets.” As a result, “you end up with, like, an outsized ratio of journalist questions and crypto journalists to market cap.”
Gensler basically accused Sorkin (and other journalists, I guess?) of focusing too much on crypto. 
Okay, fair point, I suppose. But perhaps it’s equally fair to say that the SEC is seeking a budgetary bump thanks to its strong focus on crypto. And Gensler has made it pretty clear that he thinks the SEC ought to have a bigger, not smaller, role in overseeing an industry that has attracted billions of dollars of capital over a relatively short period. 
There ought to be an equal trade off. Want more power? Prepare to answer more questions. Seems pretty fair to me.

Sophon ZKSync hyperchain raises $60M in node sale

Sophon, an entertainment-focused zkSync Hyperchain, has secured $60 million worth of Wrapped Ether (wETH) through its node sale.The funding will be used to launch Sophon, an artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming-focused ecosystem built as a modular rollup leveraging zero knowledge (ZK) technology, aiming to launch in the third quarter of 2024. The $60 million node sale is considered high for an emerging project. Part of the node sale’s success can be attributed to the need for reliable infrastructure for entertainment-focused use cases such as gaming and AI, according to Seb, the co-founder of Sophon.Seb told Cointelegraph:“Gaming and AI require their tech partners to be able to scale cheaply and with robust infrastructure. Choosing ZK tech here is the move that these folks are making since the TPS capacity is much larger than within optimistic setups, and especially within the zkSync codebase, the fees are much less dynamic — therefore gas does not fluctuate as much.”Both gaming and AI protocols are reliant on robust infrastructure to accommodate user demand and the high amount of microtransactions associated with these use cases. Seb added:“Gaming or AI protocols generate millions of transactions, and running a zkEVM [zkEthereum Virtual Machine] in Validium mode guarantees the lowest fees as well as the most scalable infra, which doesn’t rupture when there are network surges.”The node sale offered a total of 200,000 nodes for purchase and came in addition to Sophon’s recent $10 million funding round led by prominent investors, including Paper Ventures and Maven 11, with participation from Spartan, SevenX and OKX Ventures.Related: Trader loses 7-figure sum due to 0L Network hard forkIncoming airdrops for Sophon node holdersBeyond just raising capital, the recent node sales aimed to create a foundational community of holders that can expect airdrops and other valuable rewards in the future. Seb explained:“The node sale is essentially creating a bag holder OG community of thousands of folks before we even launch the chain. We will strive to always deliver value to them, constantly in the forms of emission fees, airdrops and other projects.”Airdrops are a popular way to attract new users to early-stage decentralized finance (DeFI) protocols. It involves issuing new tokens to early users who previously interacted with a protocol.Through its future incentives, Sophon aims to build a strong community of builders and enthusiasts, that could amplify the network effects of projects building on the protocol. Seb added:“This is incredibly valuable and super attractive to builders. This accelerates a very positive flywheel effect that will grow the community and hence make it valuable for gaming or AI projects to pick Sophon over the other options.”Related: Solana could flip Ethereum in transaction fees within a week: Report

New Development in the Ripple (XRP) Case: SEC Used Its Last Trump card and Requested an Injunction! - Bitcoin Sistemi

There has been a new development in the legal fight between Ripple and the SEC, which has been going on for about three and a half years.
The SEC has filed its final response in the complex ongoing litigation, and the case has reached a critical point.


At this point, while all eyes are on the judge's decision with the SEC's response, some industry participants believe that there may be an agreement between the SEC and Ripple, while others think that there is no possibility of an agreement due to the complexity of the court process and that the case may even take longer.
What Did the SEC Say in Its Response?
In its response to the court, the SEC reiterated its claim that Ripple's main activity is the unregistered sale of XRP, and also mentioned that Ripple is preparing to launch a new cryptocurrency.





Stating that Ripple acted recklessly in its new blockchain initiative, these statements of the SEC were interpreted as a warning that the stablecoin that Ripple plans to launch in the near future will also be issued unregistered and as an effort to block the project.
The SEC also argued for a permanent injunction, citing concerns about Ripple's reliance on the sale of XRP as its main source of revenue.


XRP Case Will Be Over Very Soon!
While there was a lot of criticism against the SEC's approach to Ripple, an evaluation came from Ripple's Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty.
Accusing the SEC of not enforcing the law and trying to mislead the judge handling the case, Alderoty said he believed the case would be over very soon.





Alderoty also recently criticized the SEC's stance on crypto regulation, claiming that other international financial regulators are not respected.

“If you are a financial regulator outside the US and have done the hard work to create comprehensive crypto licensing frameworks, know that the SEC does not respect you and thinks you are handing out the equivalent of fishing licenses.”



Possible Effects of the Decision!
The conclusion of the Ripple-SEC case also affects the entire cryptocurrency industry, such as XRP. Because Ripple's victory may result in a rally for XRP and many other cryptocurrencies, but in an opposite scenario, it may have negative consequences for XRP and the crypto industry.

Chainalysis sets up regional HQ in Dubai amid local crypto boom

The blockchain data and analytics company Chainalysis has moved its regional headquarters to Dubai following close cooperation with the local government. On May 8, the company announced the inauguration of its headquarters for Southern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa in Dubai.According to the announcement, the analytics firm has been “actively engaging” with local government stakeholders to offer advice on best practices for regulatory development in the crypto industry that drive innovation. 


This has included a partnership with the United Arab Emirates’ Ministry of Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications to create an excellence center for government employees to “upskill” their knowledge and prowess on blockchain technology. It has also set up a Centre of Excellence that helps government employees upskill in blockchain technologies. Two days prior, on May 6, Chainalysis entered into a memorandum of understanding with Emirates NBD, through which it said it would support the banking leader’s Digital Asset Lab program.Michael Gronager, CEO of Chainalysis, commented that the UAE government has “spearheaded the crypto revolution” with its crypto-related policies. “The true potential and value of cryptocurrencies lies in their ability to transfer value, and we’re seeing an upward trend of overall transfer activity… the UAE is strongly positioned to lead innovation with novel use cases that deliver tangible value to consumers and businesses.”Cointelegraph reached out to Chainalysis for additional information on the development. Related: Chainalysis will help Tether monitor secondary market for illicit activityThis regional headquarters will allow the company to support emerging markets, such as India, Africa and Central Asia. Nicola Buonanno, Chainalysis’ vice president of Southern EMEA, said the UAE market is at a “tipping point,” with institutional-sized transfers now accounting for the “lion’s share” of the country’s crypto activity. Buonanno said that, therefore, the need for investigating the local industry for better compliance, market intelligence and data solutions is “greater than ever.” Chainalysis is just one of the many crypto and Web3-related companies that have decided to call Dubai home in the last year. An increasing number of firms within the industry have been applying for licenses and setting up shop in the Middle Eastern technopolis. On April 18, Binance reportedly received its long-awaited license to operate as a cryptocurrency exchange in Dubai. More recently, on May 7, in Dubai’s sister city Abu Dhabi, crypto options desk QCP Capital received its in-principle approval to offer regulated digital asset activities in the region.

Crypto expert PlanB sets Bitcoin price for 2024-2032


As bulls and bears continue fighting for dominance in the cryptocurrency sector, particularly over Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset is looking at impressive price advances in the years to come, at least according to the observations of a renowned crypto trading expert.
Indeed, the average Bitcoin price for the 2020-2024 halving cycle was $34,000, which is slightly below the 2019 prediction of $55,000, as the crypto analyst and creator of the stock-to-flow (S2F) model in predicting Bitcoin’s price, PlanB, pointed out in an X post published on May 7.
Bitcoin price prediction 2024 – 2032
With this in mind, the expert refreshed the S2F model with new data that demonstrates similar parameters and results and places an average price of Bitcoin for the 2024-2028 halving cycle at $500,000, while the following halving cycle, 2028-2032, would see the maiden crypto asset at $4 million.


Bitcoin price analysis and prediction. Source: PlanB
As a reminder, PlanB has recently predicted that Bitcoin will reach the price of $100,000 in the second half of 2024, considering its April close slightly above $60,000, a 36% year-to-date (YTD) increase, and the fact that May 2024 marks the final month before the next halving cycle.
On top of that, the professional crypto trader also shared the opinion that a market peak could take place in 2025, at which time the largest asset in the crypto industry by market capitalization could potentially surpass a price of $200,000, as Finbold reported on May 2.
BTC price analysis
At press time, the current BTC price stands at $62,330, which indicates a decline of 2.73% in the last 24 hours while recording a 7.42% advance across the previous seven days and accumulating a loss of 13.90% on its monthly chart, as per the most recent data on May 8.

Ultimately, Bitcoin could, indeed, reach the price range suggested by the renowned crypto expert, or at least get near it in the years to come, particularly as PlanB isn’t the only analyst making similar predictions, others including CoinRoutes chair Dave Weisberger and the $800 billion bank Standard Chartered.

MEV collected by validators is now higher on Solana than on Ethereum - Blockworks


Solana’s validators are a bit like baristas flipping around an iPad — they’re nicer to you when you include a tip. And as traders keep cramming into Solana’s metaphorical coffee shop, the validator tip jar looks increasingly stuffed with money. 
Validators are a group of 1,728 computers that run software to produce blocks on the Solana blockchain. Coinbase Cloud is a prominent Solana validator, as is Google Cloud. One revenue stream that validators earn is called maximal extractible value (MEV), which refers partly to tips paid by searchers to be included in Solana blocks. 
This MEV revenue has been growing quickly since mid-March. Notably, Solana validators are earning more from MEV overall than Ethereum validators, according to Blockworks Research. Just a few months ago, Solana’s MEV revenue was a rounding error compared to Ethereum’s.
Read more: MEV doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game, research suggests
Broadly defined, MEV refers to the largest amount of value that validators can create by packing transactions into blockchain blocks. Blockworks Research’s dashboard suggests Solana validators raked in a hair under $7 million from MEV last week.
At the moment, Solana MEV is almost entirely the product of a protocol named Jito. Jito offers a fork of the Solana validator called Jito-Solana, and 78% of Solana’s validators use this client, according to Jito’s website. The client lets searchers, or traders, arrange transactions in bundles. Searchers can include a tip to try getting validators to send their particular bundle to the blockchain.
Whether all this is good for Solana is something of a matter of perspective. Some forms of MEV can be predatory. Jito recently suspended its mempool, a kind of waiting area for transactions, due to “sandwich attacks” that let opportunists create MEV by trading right before and after a transaction to manipulate the price and take profit from the trader. 
Read more: Jito Labs ends mempool functionality citing impact on Solana users
In Jito’s telling, the protocol is making Solana more efficient while also minimizing negative forms of MEV like sandwich attacking. If it can pull that off, Solana could see a lot of benefit. 
Continued long-term growth in Solana’s MEV would likely imply that less spam is being included in blocks, and Solana would have more available blockspace, Blockworks Research analyst Hayden Tsutsui said. In a best case scenario, more blockspace could free up room for more on-chain activity, which could also bring along more liquidity, Tsutsui said.
But it bears mentioning that as things currently stand, Solana is still staggering under a mountain of spam. More than 60% of non-vote transactions fail on Solana, according to Blockworks Research, largely due to bots taking advantage of Solana’s cheap fees by inundating the network in hopes of getting transactions to land.

BounceBit mainnet and BB token launch scheduled for May 13: here's everything you need to know

BounceBit, a platform that deals with the practice of restaking Bitcoin, has revealed that it will land on mainnet on May 13, with the accompanying listing of the BB token that will be partially distributed to the early adopters of the project as an airdrop.
BounceBit is one of the most interesting and followed protocols in the crypto world, given its promise to bring BTC directly into DeFi, so much so that it managed to attract a whopping 1 billion dollars in TVL before its official launch.
Let’s see all the details below.

BuonceBit’s restaking blockchain prepares for mainnet
BounceBit, innovative cryptographic protocol aiming to implement restaking on Bitcoin, is about to launch its own PoS blockchain on May 13 bringing new opportunities in the crypto world and new interconnections between DeFi and CeFi.
This project was born with the aim of  offering a yield to native BTC holders by exploiting the arbitrage of funding rates on cryptocurrency futures markets.
By staking their BTC on Bouncebit (or other tokens like WBTC, BTCB, USDT, and FDUSD), users agree to convert their BounceBTC resources, which is a currency representing the stake of BTC built with a more efficient standard for EVM blockchains.
This is delegated to multiple validators, who use it to launch their own services (similar to EigenLayer’s AVS), giving the token owner in exchange the liquid staking derivative stBTC, as well as the returns generated from interest rate arbitrage.
In this way, the security and liquidity of the Bitcoin world are inherited by the new protocols, which can propose hybrid solutions between centralized and decentralized markets to exploit high yields.

A few days ago, the BounceBit team announced to their audience that the so-called “restaking chain” will be launched on mainnet on May 13th.
At this moment, until the official launch, all premium yields will be suspended and it will no longer be possible to stake additional resources to earn additional yield.
Anyway, the previous bets will continue to earn based on the chosen strategy.
From here until May 13, node operators will be appointed and included in the initial set of BounceBit, so that they can delegate their BBTC/BB to validators as soon as the mainnet is launched.
In the following two days (12-13 May) the distribution of LCT will take place for Early Access users on BounceBit Chain, BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum.
You can refer to the following image to understand which LTC you are entitled to and what are the waiting times for withdrawals, if you have deposited assets on Bouncebit in the past weeks.
Once these steps are completed, the Bouncebit network will go live and the BB token will be launched on major cryptocurrency exchanges.

WARNING: if you have deposited crypto in the Premium Yield, you can withdraw the funds only from May 20 onwards, directly on the original chain (WBTC on Ethereum and BTCB on BNB Chain)
The BB token will enter the market on May 13th on the main crypto exchanges: airdrop for early users
As mentioned, BounceBit’s mainnet underlies the listing of BB, the project’s token that will play a very important role in the PoS dual staking with the BTCB/BB pair.
Simultaneously with the launch of BB which will be included in several Tier-1 exchanges like Binance, there will be the airdrop for early adopters of the platform who have supported the growth of the protocol by depositing coins in the past weeks.
The points obtained on the protocol will be converted into tokens for all eligible subjects: at the moment it is not yet possible to view a conversion rate.
Anyway, the snapshot has already been taken so interacting now with BounceBit will not entitle you to a new allocation.

It is essential to know that THERE ARE NO CLAIMS TO BE MADE, but the airdrop will be automatically distributed in the form of BB tokens on the new BounceBit blockchain.
Pay attention to scams and be wary of any interaction with your wallet that is connected to claiming the prize.
Together with the airdrop, the Megadrop event organized by Binance will also conclude, where users were invited to try the BounceBit protocol directly from the exchange’s web3 wallet.
During this phase, over 100,000 individuals participated in the initiative, making it one of the most followed among those led by Binance. Obviously, the prizes will not be so appealing, given the significant influx of farmers.
Both the rewards for the Premium Yield Generation stake and those for the Megadrop will be available before trading for BB opens

With the launch of BB, the generation of premium yields for new stakers will also be reopened, in addition to the withdrawal of assets from liquid staking.
The MUBI, AUCTION, and DAII tokens deposited during the Water Margin event will be returned to your Ethereum wallet. We cover the gas fees.
As announced by the project, the BB resource, in addition to playing a fundamental role in the proof of stake consensus, will be used to cover transaction gas to support BounceClub applications such as liquidity and to vote on future governance decisions.

We do not know what the listing price of BB will be, even though we know the maximum supply, set at 2.1 billion tokens, and the circulating supply estimated at 19.5% of the total.
Currently on Whales.market each Bouncebit point is quoted at 0.0089 dollars: we can get a rough idea of how much the airdrop will be worth by multiplying the number of points obtained by their market value.
By eye and cross, with an estimated FV of 10 billion dollars, each BB should be worth around 5 dollars.

Elon Musk’s Grok AI Criticized by Bitcoiner Erik Voorhees: Details


Serial tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, owner of the X platform, who founded xAI startup, among other companies, has suggested a crucial reason why his AI company and its product Grok have to succeed and beat its rivals.Erik Voorhees, Bitcoiner and chief executive of ShapeShift, responded to Musk, pointing out a big drawback at Grok and suggesting a “better option.”Elon Musk says xAI and Grok have to succeedElon Musk published a tweet to remind his hundreds of millions of followers that training a non-woke AI is vitally important for the future of humanity. For this reason, his tweet states, it is crucial that xAI and its Grok AI chatbot succeed.The tweet also contains a picture of the knights of the Round Table, where King Arthur is signed as “ChatGPT” and a night to his right is the AI being created by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.In a recent public talk, Musk also touched on the issue of the AI future. He then stated that it is vitally important to train AI to be as truth-seeking and curious as possible – in this case it is likely to foster humanity in the future. The tech mogul believes that AI must be taught to speak the truth even if it is politically or socially incorrect. He referred to the renowned science fiction movie “2001: A Space Odyssey,” where the AI called Hal killed the astronaut crew in the end.Overall, Musk stated that as years go by, the percentage of biological intelligence will keep reducing and the percentage of artificial intelligence will grow.Erik Voorhees: Grok remains closed-sourceCEO of cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift Erik Voorhees responded to Musk, sharing his take on his Grok chatbot, which Musk launched with the help of xAI to oppose OpenAI’s ChatGPT.Voorhees believes that Grok is “still centralized and closed-source.” He suggested using Venice AI as a “better option.” At the end of February, Musk announced an upcoming update for his AI product – the Grok 1.5 version release. He then emphasized during an X Space that “all the code and data is open source” and that anyone can check Grok for themselves.Bitcoin advocate Jeff Kirdeikis responded to Voorhees that he had tried Venice AI but it proved “unfortunately no better when asked about many controversial topics.”

A new era for Bitcoin in Hong Kong thanks to Wintermute

In a significant development for the cryptocurrency market in Hong Kong, Wintermute, a global leader in cryptocurrency market making, has announced its support for liquidity for the newly launched Bitcoin spot ETFs. 
This move, carried out in collaboration with OSL and HashKey, who act as sub-custodians for these ETFs, marks a crucial moment for cryptocurrency investments in Asia.
A new era for Bitcoin in Hong Kong thanks to Wintermute
On April 30th, six spot ETFs of bitcoin and ether made their debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, signaling a new era for institutional and retail investors in the region. This launch is seen as a significant step towards integrating digital assets into more traditional investment portfolios. 
By offering a regulated avenue to invest in cryptocurrencies, these ETFs aim to provide investors with the benefits of digital assets, such as high liquidity and exposure to leading cryptocurrencies, while mitigating the risks associated with direct purchases and custody of digital coins.
Wintermute’s involvement should improve the stability and liquidity of these ETFs. As a market maker, Wintermute provides buying and selling quotes for the ETFs, ensuring that there is always enough liquidity, which helps minimize entry and exit costs for investors. This is particularly important in the often volatile cryptocurrency markets, where rapid and significant price movements can occur.
By collaborating with OSL and HashKey, Wintermute not only supports liquidity but also ensures that the operational structure of these ETFs is robust and secure. OSL and HashKey, as sub-custodians, are responsible for the secure custody of the physical bitcoins and ethers that back the ETFs. 
Their expertise in crypto custody and compliance adds an additional level of security and trust to operations, encouraging more investors to consider these ETFs as a valid investment option.
Hong Kong has been at the forefront in embracing financial innovation, and the launch of these ETFs is a testament to the region’s proactive approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. The Hong Kong government and regulatory bodies have worked diligently to establish a clear legal framework for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.
Market Impact and Investor Interest
Wintermute’s announcement will likely be welcomed by investors, especially those who have been reluctant to invest directly in cryptocurrencies due to security concerns and regulatory uncertainty. ETFs offer a familiar structure that can be integrated into traditional investment portfolios. Additionally, the support of established custodians such as OSL and HashKey provides reassurance about the security of the underlying assets.
Furthermore, Wintermute’s liquidity support could lead to more stable and less volatile trading conditions for these ETFs. For institutional investors, this means that ETFs could be used not only as investment vehicles, but also for hedging purposes and other strategies.
The collaboration between Wintermute, OSL, and HashKey in supporting the new bitcoin and ether spot ETFs in Hong Kong represents a significant milestone in the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance. 
Reflects a growing recognition of the potential of digital assets and sets a precedent for other markets globally. As the investment landscape continues to evolve, the success of these ETFs could pave the way for further innovative financial products and attract a wider range of investors to the cryptocurrency market.

AI-powered smart contracts could be ‘transformative’ - Ava Labs founder

“Smart contract programming is hard,” said Emin Gün Sirer, founder of Ava Labs, which built the Avalanche blockchain. Capturing “intent” is difficult. Coding is tricky. Verification remains a challenge. “This is the main problem that is keeping smart contracts from flourishing,” added Sirer, speaking at the recent Cornell Blockchain Conference in New York City. But imagine if artificial intelligence (AI) “agents” like ChatGPT or Llama could do all that smart contract coding for you. Lawyers, as opposed to coders, might soon become the dominant writers of smart contracts. Even more interesting, everyday people would be able to write smart contracts in their native language — peer-to-peer — almost as easily as they write bank checks today. That is the future, suggested Sirer at the April 26 event held at Cornell Tech’s stunning Roosevelt Island campus in New York City, further explaining:“All of you are familiar with writing checks, right? That’s the maximum complexity instrument that my retail bank offers to me. At present, you have few options. You can write a check to ‘John’ that essentially says ‘I hereby transfer to John $5,000’ — and that’s about it.” But suppose that you could do the same thing but add additional instructions, Sirer continued, for example:“‘I hereby give John $5,000 if and only if he can collect $5 million by the end of September to film a movie. And if he can’t do it, then I want my money back.’ I can just write this.”Sirer said the scenario he envisions is still five to 10 years away, but if and when it does come, it will be “transformative.” We would “be able to onboard billions of new [blockchain] users.” At present, most smart contracts are written in Solidity, a computer language that remains obscure even among programmers. But Avalanche has begun building a new virtual machine at the intersection of AI and blockchains, Sirer said, which is “programmed in a natural language. You write your programs in English, German, French, Tagalog, Chinese [...] a natural language that your mother taught you in your mother’s tongue.” Questions remainBut is all this just pie in the sky? Many issues need to be resolved before these “coin-operated agents,” as Sirer calls them, can be widely deployed. Legalities need to be worked out. Keywords and terms will have to be defined unambiguously. A word like “software,” for instance, might have to be very carefully defined before it can be used in smart contracts involving software licenses. All this could take some time. Recent: EU crypto regulations undermined by lack of enforcement, say observersThen, too, AI “agents” may not be quite ready to write legally binding documents. Large language models (LLMs) can “hallucinate,” after all. “Everybody has seen [AI-generated] pictures of seven-fingered people,” Sirer noted.But there are short-term solutions for some of these problems. One could submit transactions to both ChatGPT 3.5 and Llama, for example, requiring both agents to agree before a smart contract solution is accepted. “So that way, at least, you get two trusted executors, and you are taking the intersection of their actions.”“Plain English instructions” for smart contractsOthers suggest that smart contracts that can handle “natural” language are already here — or at least close at hand. “The capability to allow every individual to be their own programmer exists in the world today,” Sam Friedman, principal solutions architect at Chainlink Labs, told Cointelegraph. Friedman cited Council, the AI agent framework developed by ChainML, a project in the Chainlink BUILD program, that “enables developers to provide plain English instructions immediately converted into executable code. Today, that code is mostly Python or SQL. But enabling smart contracts is an upgrade away.”He also mentioned Chainlink Developer Hub’s “Ask AI,” which can return a fully formed smart contract when a user submits a request in plain English, something on the order of: “Show me an example smart contract that enables a user to request a random number between one and ten. It should use Chainlink VRF.” Today’s offerings probably don’t have the full functionality that Sirer envisions, however, and Friedman told Cointelegraph that a lot of work lies ahead. “While AI agents writing smart contracts are already here, this isn’t their final form,” he said. They will still need to improve in terms of quality and complexity. “AI models need to be trained with ever-newer content for this to happen.” Still, Friedman can imagine use cases where multiple AI “agents” with distinct roles collaborate to complete the lifecycle management of a smart contract. For instance:“One agent helps define the requirements, another writes the smart contract, another performs quality and security testing, another deploys the contracts, and the last one performs ongoing maintenance or tuning of the parameters or global variables in the contract after it’s deployed.”There are still “big unknowns,” Sirer acknowledged at the Cornell Tech conference, and moving the needle forward will require guidance from all sorts of individuals, “people with both a technology and an ethics and a humanities background.” A place for lawyers, too?In a question period following his presentation, Sirer was asked who would write smart contracts if Solidity was no longer required and coding could be done in ASCII text. Source: SV“Who are going to be the best programmers for this?” At first glance, software programmers would seem to have the edge. They are already skilled in defining and specifying conditions in precise language, after all. Recent: Where to store your crypto: Wallets provide diverse options for holders“But the people who know how to use regular language for specifying contracts are the lawyers. So they are going to be the kings and queens of that universe […] the ones who really figure out how to flourish in this system.”And average users? “I think they are quite capable of specifying basic transactions,” Sirer said. Indeed, he foresees these new capabilities being built on “democratic, open platforms” that “anyone can use on an equal footing.”Overall, this new approach to smart contracts is so interesting and full of promise “that we can’t just leave it on the table,” Sirer concluded.

Trader loses 7-figure sum due to 0L Network hard fork

An unfortunate trader allegedly lost over a million dollars worth of cryptocurrency due to the 0L Network hard fork.Pseudonymous trader NN lost the amount as a result of a hard fork that was not approved by the community, according to a May 8 X post:“The team behind @0LNetwork ($LIBRA) decided to hard fork because of a ‘rogue core’ member. This fork resulted in a wipeout of 4% of the total supply, also burning innocent people’s wallets, including tokens purchased almost 2 years ago.”The pseudonymous trader said that he purchased 147 million Libra tokens back in February 2023, worth approximately $1.47 million at the time, before he joined the protocol to assist with marketing efforts.Libra’s value has fallen over 58% since May 3 to trade above $0.001 as of 12:35 pm UTC, according to CoinGecko data. Libra/USDT. Source: CoinGeckoAccording to NN, the team had already been aware of the bug for over two years, with certain insiders abusing it. However, the team decided to ignore the issue due to the Libra token’s lack of value. The trader wrote: “The team allowed this ‘malicious’ act to persist for over 2 years. Only now, when the tokens gained significant value, did they decide to act. Meanwhile, many buyers, including myself, purchased OTC tokens fairly and are now suffering the consequences of unjust behavior by a team that did not take responsibility for their fault.”Source: NNThe hard fork was the result of a smart contract bug that enabled insiders to unlock vested tokens faster by distributing them across multiple wallets. However, the loophole is still present in the newest version of 0L Network, v7, according to the pseudonymous trader.Instead of fixing the loophole, the team decided to fork out all the wallets they considered to have exploited the loophole. NN claimed that the team was “fully aware that innocent wallets would be affected,” as tracing back all the tokens was impossible. NN wrote:“The blacklist was made internally, as a marketing team member, I couldn't see the fork list. The list was generated by an algorithm designed by one of their own, Hemulin (0D’s right hand), who ironically had also exploited the loophole in the past.”Despite buying tokens from six different validators, NN’s wallet was forked out due to a single validator that the team considered rogue. According to the trader, other victims have also been mistreated and kicked out of the Discord group.Related: How Binance played a key role in arrest of ZKasino scam suspectWas the pseudonymous lead designer of 0L Network previously charged by the SEC?While the identity of 0D, 0L Network’s pseudonymous lead developer, is unknown, multiple validators told NN that they could be Lucas Geiger, the founder of the OpenLibra project. Geiger was previously charged by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission with fraudulent behavior.Geiger is also the co-founder of Wireline, which raised $20 million in March 2018 for a decentralized peer-to-peer developer and business network. Despite the raise, no network was developed, and the promised WRL ERC-20 tokens have yet to be distributed to investors. In January 2021, the SEC levied a $650,000 fine against Wireline for an unregistered securities offering and alleged fraud involving Wireline Developer Fund, the firm’s Cayman Islands-based subsidiary.Related: Solana could flip Ethereum in transaction fees within a week: Report

PEPE's 7-Day Bull Run Put on Hold, Explained by On-Chain Data - DailyCoin


        
PEPE faces a 6.9% drawback on Wednesday as Bitcoin (BTC) sinks to $62K.



Several key indicators show that PEPE’s 25% rally is coming to a halt.



Demand for PEPE in the Derivatives wanes with $1.10M in liquidated longs.
Pepe’s marvelous 25% bull rally over the past seven days is likely coming to a halt, judging by several on-chain metrics. While the crypto community was excited three days ago over a massive Binance whale cash out of 1.23 trillion PEPE tokens, the same whale shuffled this amount back to the exchange yesterday.
Another crypto whale shuffled a colossal 1,241,850,000,000 PEPE tokens from Binance to an untagged wallet on-chain. Worth $10.5 million at the time, the receiving end of this hefty transaction has been confirmed to have kept the PEPE tokens. DailyCoin’s investigation team discovered that PEPE is the second largest token in the whale’s wallet, only falling behind Ether (ETH).This hints at indecision among the largest PEPE token holders, which became uncertain among crypto enthusiasts. Over the past 24 hours, PEPE slipped by 6.9%, but the combined Spot market liquidity books don’t give the bears an edge just yet—the latest bids and sales are almost evenly balanced at $37M in buys and $38M in sales.PEPE Takes a Hit on Derivatives MarketsSince last month, the hype surrounding PEPE has been closely tied to Coinbase’s listing of the token on its Coinbase International platform. The move to include a 1,000 times multiplied PEPE Futures contract was unexpected due to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s previous unfavorable statements regarding PEPE.Meanwhile, the high-rolling crypto enthusiasts partaking in PEPE Futures trades have lost steam on Coinbase, as the latest 24-hour volume for PEPE futures trades has plunged by 63% to $164.8K. Real-time on-chain data by CoinGlass indicated similar daily drops for PEPE Futures trades on Binance and Bybit, resulting in a 39.33% overall trading volume drop on Crypto Derivatives.As of press time, PEPE is exchanging hands at $0.000007848, sliding down from the weekly heights of $0.000009046. With $1.10 million in daily liquidated long positions on PEPE Derivatives, the long versus short ratio remains slightly on the bearish side at 0.912. The negative Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) index at -0.12 affirms today’s PEPE drawdown.
While the current PEPE price range is still considerably higher than PEPE’s monthly bottom at $0.00000447, hit on April 14, 2024, PEPE’s forthcoming price trajectory could go either way due to a neutral Relative Strength Index (RSI) and ultra-wide Bollinger Bands. The RSI’s point of 55 confirms the indecision among large crypto investors while widening Bollinger Bands hint at likely price fluctuations.On the Flipside
Despite several bearish on-chain indicators, PEPE’s holder base has grown exponentially.



Both active PEPE wallets and new PEPE wallets soared by 44% since last week, according to IntoTheBlock.
Why This MattersPEPE is among the top performers in the alternative crypto markets, yielding a 241% return in yearly terms.Discover DailyCoin’s trending crypto news:Crypto Exchange Fees Comparison 2024: Who Has the Lowest Trading Fees?Michael Saylor Warns SEC to Flag ETH, ADA, SOL as Securities

Ethereum's Next Big Leap? Buterin Proposes EIP-7702


								Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, along with collaborators Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs, and Matt Garnett, has proposed a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) numbered 7702, designed to significantly enhance the functionality of Ethereum’s externally owned accounts (EOAs). EIP-7702 aims to integrate smart contract functionalities temporarily into EOAs, a transformative concept that might redefine user interactions on the Ethereum network.
Evolution Of Account Abstraction On Ethereum
Ethereum’s account model includes two primary types: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts. EOAs are controlled by private keys and have limited capabilities and security features, which restrict their use in more complex transactions typically reserved for smart contracts.
To address these limitations, several EIPs have been introduced:

EIP-4337: Implemented in March 2023, it established a framework allowing smart contracts to act as accounts that can validate and execute transactions, known as User Operations (UserOps). This proposal significantly enhanced user experience by integrating advanced functionalities like biometrics, especially in applications developed by platforms such as Polygon and Coinbase.
EIP-3074: Proposed before EIP-4337, it aimed to empower EOAs by allowing them to delegate their transaction authority to smart contracts temporarily. This proposal included two new opcodes, AUTH and AUTHCALL, to facilitate this delegation, although it raised security concerns regarding potential misuse by malicious contracts.
EIP-5003: Building on EIP-3074, this proposal introduced the AUTHUSURP opcode to enable a permanent transformation of an EOA into a smart contract account, addressing some compatibility issues with EIP-4337 but also creating potential fragmentation in account abstraction methodologies.


Innovative Aspects of EIP-7702
The introduction of EIP-7702 is a response to the complex landscape shaped by its predecessors. It proposes a leaner, more integrated approach by allowing EOAs to temporarily adopt smart contract code during transactions, thereby combining the security and simplicity of EOAs with the versatility of smart contracts.


Here’s how EIP-7702 works: At the start of a transaction, the EOA’s contract_code field is temporarily set to a specific smart contract code necessary for the transaction. This code executes the transaction, leveraging smart contract functionalities. Upon completion of the transaction, the contract_code is cleared, reverting the EOA to its original state.
This process bypasses the need for new opcodes and the associated hard forks, as it uses callable functions (verify for AUTH and execute for AUTHCALL) instead, which can integrate seamlessly with the existing Ethereum infrastructure.
Jarrod Watts, a developer relations engineer at Polygon, highlighted the significance of EIP-7702, remarking, “Vitalik just proposed EIP-7702. It’s one of the most impactful changes Ethereum is going to have… EVER.” The community’s reaction underscores the transformative potential of EIP-7702 in bridging the gap between traditional EOAs and more dynamic smart contract accounts.

“EIP-7702 represents a fusion of the flexibility of smart contracts with the foundational security model of EOAs,” Watts commented. “It’s a significant stride towards making Ethereum more accessible and secure for everyday users.”


If adopted, EIP-7702 could fundamentally change how users interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and manage digital assets on the Ethereum network. By enabling EOAs to temporarily operate with the advanced features of smart contracts, EIP-7702 promises a seamless, more secure user experience that could accelerate the adoption of Ethereum’s more sophisticated capabilities.
However, the success of EIP-7702 depends on thorough testing, community consensus, and careful consideration of security implications, particularly how temporary smart contract codes are managed and revoked.
At press time, ETH traded at $2,997.

Ethereum Network Activity Hints At Imminent Takeoff


                            Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, finds itself in a curious position. While the price struggles for direction, its underlying network is experiencing a surge in activity.

Ethereum Network Sees Increase In New Users
According to crypto data firm Santiment, May 4th saw a whopping 200,000 new Ethereum addresses created, marking the highest single-day growth in nearly two years.
This surge suggests a renewed interest in the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially driven by factors like the burgeoning Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space and the ever-evolving world of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

This network growth is a bullish signal, and indicates strong and increasing interest in Ethereum, which could translate to significant capital inflows when macroeconomic conditions become more favorable.

Is The Price Dip A Buying Opportunity?
While the network thrives, Ethereum’s price currently sits at $2,995, a 1.8% decline in the past 24 hours. This puts it precariously close to falling below its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a technical indicator often interpreted as a sign of bearish momentum.
However, a closer look reveals a potentially bullish twist. The price decline is accompanied by a drop in trading volume, which could indicate that selling pressure is waning. Historically, such a scenario has sometimes preceded a price reversal, where buyers re-enter the market, pushing prices upwards.

Investor Optimism Buoyed By Potential Fed Pivot
The recent weakness in the US economy, highlighted by a disappointing jobs report, has sparked speculation that the Federal Reserve might consider easing interest rates. This could inject fresh liquidity into the market, potentially benefiting riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.
According to analysts, a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve could be a game-changer for Ethereum. Lower interest rates generally make holding cryptocurrencies more attractive compared to traditional fixed-income investments.

The future path of Ethereum remains uncertain. While the network’s fundamentals appear robust, the price faces immediate challenges. Navigating this complex scenario will require investors to carefully consider both the on-chain activity and the broader economic landscape.
Regulation and Innovation: Key Factors to Watch
Regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies will undoubtedly play a crucial role in attracting institutional investors, a potential catalyst for significant price growth.

The Stellar network is on the verge of a game-changing upgrade that might redefine its ecosystem: the Protocol 21 upgrade.The upgrade comes after the successful mainnet launch of Soroban, Stellar's smart contract platform, following a successful validator vote on Feb. 20, 2024.Now, almost three months later, Stellar network readies for another protocol vote. On June 18, 2024, Stellar public network validators will vote on whether to upgrade the network to Protocol 21 which, if approved, will enable five new Core Advancement Proposals (CAPs) on Stellar’s Mainnet. These five CAPs provide several exciting new features, including passkey signing support and an upgrade to state archives as well as cost savings for smart contract transactions.These include CAP-0051, smart contract host functionality or secp256r1 verification, which enables secp256r1 verification of Stellar's smart contracts via the exported host interface.The acceptance of this CAP will enable secp256r1 verification, allowing developers to create contracts that include passkeys to sign smart contract transactions instead of utilizing passphrases or signing keys.CAP-0053 allows for the extension of the time to live (TTL) for contract instances and contract code through independent Soroban smart contract host functions.The other three CAPs use different ways to keep Soroban transactions affordable. They include CAP-0054: The Soroban refined VM instantiation cost model refines the cost model for virtual machine (VM) instantiation.CAP-0055: Soroban streamlined linking reduces overall costs by linking to fewer host functions during virtual machine (VM) instantiation.CAP-0056: Soroban intra-transaction module caching reduces overall costs by caching parsed Wasm modules within Soroban transactions.The Testnet upgrade to Protocol 21 is scheduled for May 14, 2024, with the Mainnet vote taking place on June 18, 2024.As the countdown to the upgrade continues, anticipation continues to mount within the Stellar community and beyond. With its potential to usher in a new era of innovation and growth, the upcoming upgrade represents a watershed moment in Stellar's journey and could set the stage for even greater achievements in the months and years to come.

Mastercard and US banks collaborate to streamline settlement of tokenized assets.


							

Mastercard and US banks collaborate on shared-ledger tech, aiming to streamline settlement of tokenized assets.



Major US banks seek SEC assistance for Bitcoin ETF participation amidst regulatory hurdles.



Republic First Bank’s closure underscores banking sector challenges, prompting calls for regulatory adjustments.




Mastercard, in collaboration with major US banks, is pioneering a new frontier in financial technology by testing shared-ledger technology as per Bloomberg report. This innovation aims to enable the seamless settlement of tokenized assets, including commercial bank money and various securities such as Treasury bonds and investment-grade debt. 



The initiative, known as the Regulated Settlement Network proof-of-concept, seeks to streamline transactions in dollars, with the ultimate goal of enhancing cross-border transaction efficiency while minimizing errors and fraud risks.







Ledger technology holds transformative potential, potentially revolutionizing financial transaction processes. Currently, assets like commercial bank money and securities operate on disparate systems. 



However, by tokenizing these assets and leveraging distributed ledger technology, settlement processes could be consolidated onto a unified platform. This trial represents an evolution from a previous 12-week test focused on domestic and cross-border payments in dollars, initiated in late 2022.



The trial involves notable institutions like Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Visa Inc., Swift, and other significant players in finance. Additionally, expertise from entities such as the Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association will enhance the trial’s effectiveness.While financial institutions globally have been exploring shared ledgers for tokenized transactions, commercial deployment is not guaranteed from this trial.









In a separate development, major US banks are seeking assistance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to participate in the recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) market. 



Leading banking associations, including the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) and the American Bankers Association (ABA), have penned a joint letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, requesting targeted modifications to Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121) to facilitate their involvement.



Meanwhile, the recent closure of Republic First Bank, marking its second collapse after 2023, underscores the challenges facing the banking sector. This event highlights ongoing concerns within the industry and emphasizes the need for regulatory adjustments to address systemic vulnerabilities.

Ripple's Planned Stablecoin Draws SEC Scrutiny for Unregistered Status | Coinspeaker



The SEC says Ripple’s intention to issue a stablecoin, an unregistered asset, is further proof that it will continue to break the law.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has now set its sights on Ripple’s planned stablecoin, according to a recent court filing. The Commission believes that Ripple’s proposed cryptocurrency is proof of the company’s continuous disregard for the law.
SEC Argues against Ripple Using Stablecoin
In a brief on May 7, the SEC described the forthcoming stablecoin as an “unregistered crypto asset”. It then argued that the plan points to the possibility that only a permanent injunction will stop Ripple from unregulated offers and activities. The SEC says Ripple has been conducting unregistered institutional sales of XRP and will keep doing so if the court does not issue an injunction.




In addition to targeting the new stablecoin, the SEC dismissed Ripple’s promise to comply with US securities law since it has licenses from several other jurisdictions. According to the brief, “this argument – akin to saying a New York restaurant need not obtain a liquor license because it obtained a fishing license in California – is absurd”.
Furthermore, the SEC argues that the court should impose a heavy penalty on Ripple because the company made a lot of money from selling XRP. Although the brief admits that the SEC’s requested penalty is large, the SEC argues it is consistent with other cases where the penalty is consistent with gains. The brief adds:
“Given the nearly $1 billion Ripple gained violating Section 5, the multi-billion-dollar business it built selling XRP (accounting for the value of Ripple’s massive XRP holdings and its cash on hand), the ‘low’ penalty Ripple demands would be a ‘slap on the wrist’ that neither punishes nor deters. To the contrary, it would encourage other crypto asset issuers to violate Section 5 by making it a remarkably lucrative endeavor, and thus deprive investors the disclosures Congress mandates, as a  mere ‘cost of doing business’.”
Ripple has responded to the SEC’s brief, dismissing it as the SEC’s failure to faithfully apply the law. In a post on X, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty accused the SEC of trying to pull the wool over the Judge’s eyes. Interestingly, Alderoty said Ripple is “closer than ever” to resolving the lawsuit.
The New Stablecoin
Last month, Ripple announced plans to launch a US dollar-backed stablecoin as it plans to continue the integration between the cryptocurrency and traditional finance industries. According to an official Ripple publication, the stablecoin will be backed by dollar deposits, short-term US government treasuries, and other cash equivalents.
The publication highlights a few benefits of the stablecoin, including what the company describes as a “compliance-first mindset”. Ripple says the company and its subsidiaries collectively hold several licenses, including a New York BitLicense and about 40 money transmitter licenses in the US. In addition, Ripple and its subsidiaries have licenses from the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Central Bank of Ireland. During the Paris Blockchain Week last month, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the stablecoin would support liquidity on its XRP Ledger (XRPL).

Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY) Will Rally Over 6,000%, as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lose Momentum



                    

Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Solana Doggy (SOLDOGGY), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Solana Doggy presents a similar opportunity.



Solana Doggy has a market cap around $13,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 6,000% in the coming two days, and Solana Doggy could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Solana Doggy can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Solana Doggy on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Solana Doggy by entering its contract address – 3f3XRScU3PnaXvsZ4ZGjxDa15SmbhWeMLxHmSyNngaAE – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SOLDOGGY.

Sell signal for two overbought cryptocurrencies this week


The cryptocurrency market has recently gone through a tumultuous phase, leaving many investors uncertain. Amid this turmoil, most cryptocurrencies quickly shifted from overbought statuses to more neutral or even oversold positions according to their Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings.
However, some assets managed to buck the trend, securing significant gains while maintaining a high Relative Strength Index. Finbold identified this sell signal using the 24-hour RSI heatmap from CoinGlass‘s momentum indicator, considering that overbought cryptocurrencies are likely to retrace eventually.
Tellor (TRB): A steep ascent signals caution
Tellor (TRB), a blockchain-based oracle network and Chainlink (LINK) competitor, has exhibited an extraordinary price surge. From a low of $42.73 to a high of $141.72, TRB has seen an increase of nearly 200% in value over a week. This sharp rise has catapulted its 24-hour RSI to 79.88 and an even more pronounced four-hour RSI to 80.54, signaling an overbought scenario.

Additionally, the significant price increase of 21.3% in the last 24 hours has pushed its current price to $132.66, far above its 30-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $76.48.
Despite a more moderate weekly RSI of 60.35, the short-term indicators suggest that Tellor might be due for a price correction as traders could start taking profits, anticipating a pullback after such rapid gains.
Frontier (FRONT): Sustained overbought conditions
Frontier (FRONT), presents a similar picture, with its 24-hour RSI standing at 74.66, while the four-hour RSI slightly edges higher to 72.83. Even its hourly RSI level of 71.82 reflects sustained buying pressure that has not abated, leading to a 19.3% increase in its price over the last day, now valued at $1.529.

The week-long RSI at 58.35 shows a less intense but still elevated momentum compared to normal trading conditions, hinting that FRONT may also be approaching a peak.
This persistent overbought condition for both TRB and FRONT occurs against a backdrop of broader market declines and anxieties over future economic policies, including the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.
While some investors might interpret high RSI values as a cue to secure profits by selling, others may view it as a testament to the cryptocurrencies’ resilience and potential for further gains. However, historical patterns and market analysis suggest that such overbought conditions are generally followed by price retracements.
As both TRB and FRONT have shown significant price increases in a short period, coupled with high RSI readings, cautious investors might consider this an optimal moment to reassess their positions and potentially take profits before a corrective phase sets in.
Investors are advised to keep a close watch on market signals and consider the broader economic indicators that might influence cryptocurrency prices.

Public blockchain ledgers ‘not fit for purpose,’ says JPMorgan

Public blockchains are still not adequate for executing large amounts of transactions, according to JPMorgan.During the BIS Innovation Summit on May 7, Umar Farooq, the CEO of JPMorgan’s Onyx blockchain-based payment platform said:“I think you almost need something like [a Unified Ledger]. I mean, it’s actually almost a necessity because if you look at … public blockchain ledgers, they are not fit for purpose for large transactions today.”The CEO’s comments came in response to the Unified Ledger, a concept introduced by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) last year, that aims to support central bank money flows, tokenized deposits, and digital assets on its network.Farooq further explained that if a $100 million transaction were to fail, public blockchain validators can’t be held accountable. Farooq said:“Who do I sue?... You need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system.”Despite the CEO’s criticism, JPMorgan’s bank-led Onyx platform is built as a private, permissioned version of Ethereum, the world’s second-largest public blockchain network. Unlike public blockchains, Onyx’s permissioned chain enables institutions to reverse transactions.Moreover, JPMorgan’s Farooq argued that the cryptocurrencies issued on public blockchains create false incentives aiming to drive more users to the networks to push the price of the coin up. He noted that blockchains, like the Internet, should be considered a public good:“We need to get to an evolution point where the technology starts to be seen as a public good versus as a means to enrich.”Related: Solana could flip Ethereum in transaction fees within a week: ReportTradFi firms prefer public blockchains, says ex-Grayscale executiveDespite widespread criticism, traditional financial (TradFi) institutions prefer tokenizing assets on public blockchains.Speaking with Cointelegraph, Celisa Morin, who served as Vice President of Platform Distribution at Grayscale until mid-2022, said that BlackRock’s recent initiative could lead to more TradFi institutions tokenizing assets on public blockchain rather than private ones. She said:“I think we see a preference for private chains with JPMorgan’s Onyx. But I do think that this was the narrative a few years back. Now, I think it's very much the public blockchains.”Morin was referring to BlackRock’s  $100 million tokenized ‘BUIDL’ fund, which was launched on the Ethereum network on March 18.BlackRock’s BUIDL fund currently holds over $382 million as the world’s largest tokenization fund, according to Dune data.Source: DuneRelated: Trader loses 7-figure sum due to 0L Network hard fork

Lagrange Labs closes $13.2M to build out ZK proofs based on EigenLayer - Crypto Briefing




Lagrange Labs, a cryptography startup specializing in zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, has raised $13.2 million in a seed funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.The startup is based on Ethereum’s EigenLayer restaking platform and is aimed at providing decentralized applications with efficient and secure access to otherwise resource-intensive onchain computing power.Lagrange’s flagship product comes in the form of a zero-knowledge “coprover,” slated for release later this month.According to the press materials, the coprover is operates as an offchain network of specialized nodes that could execute intensive computations and generate ZK proofs based on the results. Such a setup allows for decentralized applications to verifiably access the computations without requiring trust between the initiated task and the offchain prover.Founder Ismael Hishon-Rezaizadeh explained that Lagrange’s proving systems and proof constructions can scale to “very big-data scales of verifiable computation” that otherwise would have been “infeasible.” This approach enables blockchains, which are often expensive and sluggish for certain kinds of activities, to run some computations cheaply and quickly off-chain.Lagrange’s security will be based on EigenLayer, a platform on Ethereum that allows users to “restake” ether (ETH) tokens to help secure upstart blockchain apps in exchange for extra rewards. According to Hishon-Rezaizadeh, some $6 billion worth of restaked assets has already been allocated for the security of Lagrange.Lagrange claims that they will be working to continually develop their operators and match improvements from EigenLayer’s core stack. The startup is partnered with Kraken, a crypto exchange, and Galaxy, a crypto-financial firm.Aside from the Founder’s Fund, the recently closed seed round also saw participation from Archetype Ventures, 1kx, Maven11, Volt Capital, Fenbushi Capital, CMT Digital, Mantle, and Ecosystem.

Context of the FTX collapse and liquidation of Solana assets

FTX’s assets have started the auction of its third tranche of locked Solana (SOL) tokens. This move is part of the broader strategy of liquidating assets following the infamous collapse of the FTX exchange platform. 
The auction, involving approximately 41 million locked SOL tokens, has generated great interest among investors and stakeholders in the context of digital assets.

Context of the FTX collapse and liquidation of Solana assets
FTX, once a giant in the realm of cryptocurrency exchanges, faced a dramatic fall towards the end of 2022, triggering wide implications for the crypto markets. The collapse was triggered by a liquidity crisis, allegations of poor financial management, and potential regulatory violations. 
This led FTX to declare bankruptcy, triggering a meticulous process of liquidating assets to reimburse creditors and affected parties. The locked Solana tokens represent a substantial part of FTX’s asset portfolio, and their sale is crucial in ongoing efforts to settle the platform’s significant debts.
The current auction focuses on locked Solana tokens, which will be released following a gradual schedule. These tokens are not immediately available for circulation, adding a level of complexity to their evaluation and sale. 
The decision to auction off these assets stems from the need to proactively manage the activities of the estate and maximize returns for creditors in a transparent and orderly manner.
The process involves several phases, starting with an initial bidding phase where interested parties can submit their bids. This is followed by a review period that allows the asset management to evaluate the offers and ensure compliance with legal and financial standards. 
The final phase will likely involve negotiations to finalize the sale, with the goal of achieving the best possible outcome for the creditors.
Market impact and investor interest
The auction of locked Solana tokens is a significant event for the cryptocurrency market, especially for stakeholders in the Solana ecosystem. Solana, known for its high-speed blockchain and increasing adoption in decentralized applications, remains a valuable asset despite the recent market volatility. The release of such a substantial number of tokens into the market could potentially influence Solana’s price dynamics, depending on the terms of their eventual circulation.
Investor interest in the auction has been strong, reflecting confidence in Solana’s long-term prospects and the cryptocurrency market in general. Institutional and private investors are closely watching the auction, evaluating how the unlocked tokens could impact their strategies and the overall dynamics of Solana’s supply.
Legal, regulatory considerations and future perspectives
The auction process is closely monitored according to the bankruptcy law of the United States, ensuring that all actions taken by the FTX estate adhere to strict legal and regulatory standards. 
Transparency and fairness of the auction are of utmost importance, as the results directly impact the financial recovery of numerous creditors and stakeholders affected by the collapse of FTX.
While FTX’s estate continues to navigate through its complex bankruptcy proceedings, the successful auction of locked Solana tokens could serve as a model for managing similar assets in the future. 
The cryptocurrency community and potential investors will likely examine this event, draw insights and strategies to deal with assets in similar circumstances.
In conclusion, the ongoing auction of locked Solana tokens by FTX is more than just a sale: it is a crucial event that could shape the recovery process from one of the biggest disruptions in the history of cryptocurrencies. 
While stakeholders await the outcome, the broader implications for the Solana ecosystem and the crypto market in general remain a focus of intense interest and speculation.

On-Chain Analyst Willy Woo Says Bitcoin Setting Up To Potentially Reach ‘Escape Velocity’ - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								On-chain analyst Willy Woo thinks Bitcoin (BTC) could be primed to surge in price.
Woo tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset is flashing a bullish divergence “with lots of room to run” on its volume-weighted average price (VWAP) oscillator chart.










“Seems like a good setup for BTC to reach escape velocity.”
Source: Willy Woo/X
VWAP represents the average traded price of an asset throughout the day, taking into account both volume and price. Traders use the VWAP to help them determine whether an asset is trading underbought or overbought based on its intraday price action.
Explains Woo,
“VWAP oscillator uses the ratio of price to VWAP price (z-scored), in this case I’m using on-chain volume rather than exchange reported volume…
By moving to on-chain volume the signal excludes short-term speculation and focuses on investor movements. Buy and sells by short-term speculators are ignored while buy and sell associated with exchange flows will be included.”
Based on Woo’s analysis, he appears to suggest that the bullish divergence between the VWAP oscillator and Bitcoin’s value indicates a rising appetite of investors to accumulate BTC even amid decreasing prices. In technical analysis, a bullish divergence suggests that an asset may be gearing up for a trend reversal.
Last week, Woo predicted BTC would surge to $1 million by 2035. The on-chain analyst argued that there is a historical correlation between Bitcoin’s value and the number of BTC users, which he expects to continue to increase based on his growth curve model.
Bitcoin is trading at $62,977 at time of writing and is up nearly 5% in the past week.

                        Bitcoin Cash’s ($BCH) price gains over the last seven days have outpaced market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum.Since Wednesday May 1, Bitcoin Cash has risen 11% to change hands at a current price of $453. Over the same peiod, the token representing the original unforked Bitcoin ledger, $BTC, has risen 8% and trades at $62,370 as of this writing. Ethereum ($ETH) lags behind both Bitcoin tokens this week. It only added 3.5% and currently trades at $2,999. It trailed behind its number one competitor Solana ($SOL), which rose a steamy 19% to trade at $146. Based on its current price, Bitcoin Cash is trading higher than its three-month low of $350 but a long way off its high of $700 over the same period. The coin is currently about $15 short of its 30-day moving average.This is likely due to a recent selloff, as indicated by the fact that BCH’s relative strength index (RSI) is 37 and falling, just 7 points short of being oversold.Source: TradingViewBitcoin Cash ($BCH) is Bitcoin ($BTC) for Payments
Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) and original Bitcoin ($BTC) are family. In fact, they were technically the same thing before 2017.However, that year, Bitcoiners formed two distinct factions around a software upgrade called Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91. The faction that forked from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash was in favor of larger block sizes, which reduced fees and allowed the network to process more transactions per second.Although, bigger block sizes mean miners need more power to do their business.This makes mining only really viable for universities, private companies and other organizations.The added speed enabled Bitcoin Cash to become the cryptocurrency of utility for the big block supporters, who see Bitcoin primarily as a means of payments.Original Bitcoin maxis see Bitcoin more as a store of value.
Don’t Just Bet on Bitcoin Cash! Gamble With Megadice! Token Launch
With a $9 billion market cap, Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) is so firmly entrenched in the crypto market now that it’s hard to see a future where it delivers the returns of newer offerings.There are many Web3 platforms and applications that hint at a glowing and prosperous future for crypto beyond simply payments or storing value. One such application is the world of GambleFi.GambleFi is one sector that’s getting more of a look-in nowadays. The term refers to any crypto-native online gambling platform or product.According to data by Statista, online gambling is projected to take in $100.90 billion in revenue this year. This means there has never been a better time for crypto to show the world its iGaming utility. A new ICO for Solana GameFi token Mega Dice (DICE) started in mid-April, and it has already taken over $800,000 in investments, according to the token’s website.Mega Dice launched last year as the world’s first licensed crypto casino accessible through the popular messaging app Telegram.Since then, 50,000 players have signed up and helped the casino become a well-established name in GambleFi. As the platform’s native token, players can fund games and receive winnings with $DICE.Casino customers who play with the token will get further benefits down the line, as the casino plans to integrate it into the loyalty program, offering more generous rewards to gamers who play with it. The token will also unlock exclusive competitions and VIP experiences.Lastly, Mega Dice has indicated there will be a buyback and burn program. This means the casino will periodically buy some of the tokens and remove them from circulation to keep them scarce, helping to drive their value.Follow Mega Dice news over on X/Twitter and Telegram.Join the presale now on the Mega Dice website.

Preparing for the Bull, Giant Whales Made Large Purchases in This Altcoin, The Price Increased by 40 Percent! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin affects altcoins with its price performance, some altcoins are astounding with their rise.
Among the altcoins experiencing an increase, artificial intelligence altcoins came to the top, with Arweave (AR) and Render (RNDR) taking the first two places.


At this point, AR is 40% in the last week; While RNDR pleased its investors with a 39.6% increase, it was seen that whale accumulation was behind the RNDR rise.
According to Lookonchain's post, whales have accumulated significant amounts of RNDR in recent days.





Accordingly, 0x15CF received 748,898 RNDR (worth $5.3 million) from Binance on April 30 and May 1;
0x1Cb7 received a total of 364,586 RNDR (worth $3.68 million) from exchanges in the last 5 days, with an average price of $9.19;


0xCA9C, 181,922 RNDR ($1.81 million worth) from Binance 6 days ago;
0xE61A, 58,950 RNDR ($586k worth) from Binance 5 days ago;





0x06b2 bought 50,973 RNDR (worth $510 thousand) from Binance today.


Market analysts state that they expect the upward momentum in RNDR to continue.

RNDR continues to trade at $9.98 at the time of writing.

Expert in losing money Su Zhu says you can afford to lose $10k


Three Arrows Capital (3AC) co-founder Su Zhu has claimed that “$10,000 is an amount you can definitely afford to lose if you’re in the Western world because you’ll earn that back in salary.”
Zhu made the claim on the OX podcast when asked what he would do if he started in crypto today in search of the mythical ‘100x.’
The disgraced 3AC founder and former jailbird was speaking to Frank DeGods (real name Rohun Vora) on a video titled ‘Frank Degods teaches Su Zhu how to 10x the OXFUN userbase by turning off 99% of his brain.’
During the two-hour conversation, DeGods probed Zhu about the path to ‘100x,’ asking him “If you started with $10,000 today in crypto, how would you maneuver?”
Zhu replied, “Definitely don’t do it on trading or that kind of stuff. I think you need to find a good coin — I think there’s a lot of 100x’s right now.”

He continued, “You have to get in very early so you have to screen it a bit, maybe split it into five stacks of 2,000 and just go big on some coins.
“The other nice thing about $10,000 is that it’s an amount you can definitely afford to lose if you’re in the Western world or the developed world because you’re going to earn that back in salary as well.
“If you have a salary or if you have earnings then then you can afford to lose more money because you earn it back.”
He also claimed that if you’re early in crypto, you don’t want to be “too cautious.”
More financial advice from a man who’s fund blew up
Despite the implosion of his own fund barely two years ago, the failure of his follow-up bankruptcy claims platform, and a four-month stint in a Singaporean jail, Zhu hasn’t been shy about handing out financial advice.
As well as advising the OX podcast listeners on what to do with their ‘easily-earned’ $10,000, just last month he attempted to tell $2 billion Ethena how to manage risk.
Zhu suggested that Ethena should leverage up the long side of the trade to keep the ETH ‘funding rate’ high. Rather than simply holding USDe’s staked ETH collateral, he advised using it to borrow more ETH on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave.

Read more: Ethena offers 27% on stablecoins but where is the yield coming from?
The extra funds would then be used to buy perpetual swaps, boosting the demand for leverage and keeping USDe yields up.
Comparisons have been drawn between Ethena’s USDe and Do Kwon’s collapsed algorithmic stablecoin UST, which also offered outsized ‘stable’ yields via the Anchor protocol.

Bitcoin's Price Trajectory Amidst Market Fluctuations


							

Daan Crypto stresses the importance of patience in navigating Bitcoin’s fluctuating highs and lows.



Despite recent declines, Bitcoin’s RSI and MACD hint at a potential short-term price increase.



Speculation around a potential second Trump administration presents opportunities and challenges for Bitcoin’s market dynamics.




Daan Crypto Trades, a full-time crypto trader and investor, offers a pragmatic perspective on Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations. Despite market euphoria and apprehension, Daan Crypto emphasizes the importance of patience in navigating the volatile landscape. Bitcoin’s current price of $62,371.65, along with a 24-hour trading volume of $25.19 billion, depicts a market mood marked by unpredictable highs and lows.







Moreover, while the average participant anticipates linear movements, historical data suggests otherwise. Bitcoin’s price trajectory is marked by oscillations, with a 15% bounce from lows followed by a 5% downturn. Daan underscores the necessity of patience amidst this volatility, urging investors to acknowledge the gradual formation of higher lows or reversals.



Amidst the current market dynamics, Bitcoin exhibits resilience beyond typical cycle patterns. Despite a 1.85% decline in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 43.63 hints at a potential short-term price increase. Additionally, a bullish trend indicated by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) at 46 underscores the possibility of continued price appreciation.







Source: TradingView



Subsequently, external factors such as the political landscape also influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. Speculation surrounding a potential second Trump administration presents both opportunities and challenges for the cryptocurrency market. Analysts posit that Trump’s reelection could foster a supportive regulatory environment, positively impacting Bitcoin’s hedge against de-dollarization and declining confidence in the U.S. Treasury market.







Moreover, a Trump victory may accelerate the withdrawal of foreign buyers from the U.S. Treasury market due to fiscal concerns. This could lead to a steeper nominal 2-year/10-year curve and an increase in term premium, consequently bolstering Bitcoin’s price. Notably, under Trump’s first term, average annual net selling of U.S. government debt amounted to $207 billion, compared to $55 billion under Biden’s presidency.

Meme Coin Creator Said He Had No Hands, So He Couldn’t Rug-He Lied - Decrypt

A man claiming to have no hands started a live Twitch stream encouraging crypto users to invest in his Solana meme coin last weekend—because without hands, so he claimed, he was incapable of rug pulling the project and bailing with the proceeds.“I don’t have hands, I cannot rug you guys, chill,” the dev’s Twitch channel, NoHandsNoRug, proclaimed heavy-handedly.Can you guess what happened just three minutes into the stream?According to several attendees of the livestream, which occurred on Sunday, the coin, HANDS, began accumulating liquidity. That is, until the coin’s apparent creator, standing in a bedroom with a sign tucked under his chin, revealed himself to actually have arms tucked behind his back—before sprinting to his computer and immediately using his newfound hands and fingers to pull liquidity from the project.The exploit, which took about three seconds to execute, immediately drained all liquidity from the token, leaving holders—sorry—empty-handed. It’s not the first time that a nefarious crypto user has taken advantage of live streams to whip up excitement for a new meme coin. Last week, a mom performed sexually suggestive acts on her purported son’s live stream to pump his meme coin, LIVEMOM, before the duo appeared to rug the token.This week’s less graphic sleight-of-hand may not have caught all onlookers by surprise. Just before the livestream started, one crypto user posed the exceedingly fair question: “How was token deployed then?”“Dick,” another user replied. In total, the NoHands dev made away with about 7 SOL, worth barely more than $1,000 at the time.But in crypto, one degen’s trash can always become another’s treasure. After a clip of the dastardly dev’s hand reveal began circulating on Twitter (aka X), it quickly attracted attention. Within a day, a group of four anonymous friends told Decrypt that they initiated a community takeover of HANDS, confident it had achieved enough notoriety as a meme to potentially become a meme coin with real staying power. They say they don’t hold a substantial amount of the token, but have focused their efforts on expanding NoHandsNoRug’s social media presence. On Monday, they started a Twitter account and Telegram account for the token; other community members are already building a website. Since Monday, the token has seen some $552,000 in trading volume; today it fell to a market capitalization around $16,000. HANDS’ purported new leadership say they are taking steps to prevent the token from being rugged by burning its liquidity. According to DexsSreener, however, an anonymous crypto trader currently holds about a third of the entire token supply. To be clear, meme coins like HANDS can easily be rug pulled by large holders, assuming they can find liquidity to trade.  Wusi, an pseudonymous crypto user who bought HANDS during the dev’s initial livestream, told Decrypt they lost 1 SOL when the token was rugged. They have since reinvested 2 SOL back into the project.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

New Meme Token Move from VanEck! What Meme Tokens Are There? - Bitcoin Sistemi


A new meme token move has come from VanEck, one of the leading investment managers.
At this point, VanEck announced that it was launching a meme token index and included the largest meme tokens in this index.


These meme tokens included Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki Inu (FLOKI), PEPE, Dogwifhat (WIF) and BONK.
While VanEck Digital Assets Research Head Matthew Siegel announced this news on his X account, he warned his customers that these cryptocurrencies are for entertainment purposes.

Gary Gensler Defends Robinhood Action: SEC Follows the Law - DailyCoin


        
The SEC sent Robinhood a Wells Notice, stoking concerns of further escalating the war on crypto.



Gary Gensler played down talk of a conspiracy against the crypto industry.



Industry advocates maintain foul play at the hands of authorities.
The crypto industry is increasingly under siege from US authorities, with high-profile enforcement actions fueling fears of an intensifying crackdown. The arrests of developers behind Samourai Wallet and the Securities Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Wells Notice to decentralized exchange Uniswap have crypto advocates crying foul, alleging overreach at the hands of regulators.Adding to the industry’s woes, Robinhood’s crypto division has become the latest target, receiving a Wells Notice from the SEC over the weekend. The regulatory bombardment only reinforces the narrative that US authorities intend to take down the crypto industry by any means necessary. However, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has pushed back, stating the agency is merely following the law to uphold investor protections.SEC Is Doing Its Job: Gary GenslerIn an interview with CNBC, Gensler defended the SEC’s recent actions, stating that the agency is tasked with ensuring firms promoting securities products follow the established laws, including upholding investor protections and ensuring appropriate disclosures.
When pressed on what Robinhood users should make of the Wells Notice issued to the company’s crypto division, Gensler refrained from commenting on the specific case. However, he addressed the crypto industry more broadly, asserting that the “majority of crypto tokens are securities under the law of the land as interpreted by the US Supreme Court.” He maintained that the SEC merely follows that legal precedent.Gensler reiterated that US crypto investors are not receiving the required disclosures on digital assets. The SEC chair contrasted this lack of transparency with public companies releasing quarterly reports during earnings season, stating that crypto tokens do not offer similar reporting mechanisms, leaving investors potentially in the dark about what they are investing in.Despite Gensler’s claims of justified enforcement actions, voices within the crypto industry continue to bang the drum of foul play.Dissolve the SECCiting foul play, Dave Weisberger, the CEO of CoinRoutes, stated that the SEC is not seeking regulation, but rather outright “prohibition of crypto for regular people.” Pushing back on Gensler’s criticism of inadequate disclosures, Weisberger countered, “there’s actually more information on crypto projects, certainly the ones that Robinhood lists, than there are about quite a few other assets.”
Robinhood lists 15 crypto assets, made up of large/mid caps, the two biggest memecoins, and one stablecoin.Weisberger posited that the SEC’s true goal with these enforcement actions is to drive the digital asset industry out of the US. He surmised the only motive for such a crackdown is to protect the legacy financial system from disruptive competition.ShapeShift founder Erik Voorhees echoed these sentiments, declaring the SEC an “illegitimate” organization whose existence violates constitutional rights, specifically individual liberty. In a tweet, Voorhees called for the SEC’s dissolution, asserting no government agency should interfere with adults freely trading among themselves.On the Flipside
Robinhood‘s equity volume in February was $80.9 billion versus $6.5 billion for crypto, making its legacy stock business over 12 times larger than its crypto business.



Aggressive regulatory approaches may drive crypto firms offshore or lead to the exclusion of US investors.
Why This MattersWhile it’s unlikely that a US agency would ever admit to underhand shenanigans, bringing enforcement actions against firms that have actively engaged with regulators to seek clarity makes little sense.Gary Gensler’s resignation rollercoaster leaves crypto investors disappointed.Crypto Fans Crushed: Gensler Punks with Resignation FakeoutBrian Armstrong promotes pro-crypto politicians as the solution to SEC overreach.Coinbase Boss Wants Pro-Crypto Officials to End SEC Sting

Dogecoin (DOGE) Skyrockets 582% in Key Metric as Whales Tap In


Dogecoin (DOGE) has demonstrated a remarkable surge in a critical on-chain metric over the past 24 hours, marking a notable 582% increase. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a substantial rise in Large Holders Inflow, soaring from 129.63 million DOGE to an impressive 754.75 million DOGE, equivalent to approximately $116.98 million.This surge in Large Holders Inflow suggests robust buying activity, primarily driven by influential entities such as whales and investors. These addresses typically acquire assets on centralized exchanges before transferring them to cold storage, which often indicates a bullish sentiment. Notably, spikes in Large Holders Inflows have historically aligned with market bottoms, implying significant buying during corrections.Source: IntoTheBlockHowever, it is essential to consider the outflows from these addresses, as entities may conduct transfers for various operational reasons. Analysis of the Large Holders Outflow reveals a modest increase from 471.75 million DOGE to 488.89 million DOGE, translating to approximately $75.78 million over the same period. Consequently, the Large Holders Netflow stands at 265.86 million DOGE, approximately $41.2 million in the past day.Source: IntoTheBlockThe concept of Large Holders Netflow serves as a gauge for monitoring the shifting positions of whales and investors holding over 0.1% of the circulating supply. In essence, spikes in netflow imply accumulation by significant players, indicative of a bullish stance, while declines suggest reduced positions or selling activities.The surge in Dogecoin's on-chain metrics underscores the increasing involvement of influential players in the market, signaling a potentially optimistic trajectory for the cryptocurrency. As DOGE continues to attract attention from investors and traders, its performance in these key metrics serves as a significant indicator of market sentiment.

Cardano price prediction - Perfect time to buy ADA after 25% dip? - AMBCrypto



ADA’s price has fallen by 25% in the last 30 days.
Readings from key on-chain metrics suggest that now might be a good time to buy the altcoin.

Cardano [ADA] may be due for a price rally as a key on-chain metric flashes a buy signal, Santiment noted in a new post on X (formerly Twitter).


According to the on-chain data provider, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which helps its traders identify overbought or oversold conditions, is,
 “Notably low compared to other caps, making it a slightly better buying opportunity.”
The RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude and speed of asset price movements. Traders also use it to track potential trend reversals. 
When it returns a value above 70, the asset is deemed overbought, and there is a potential price correction. When its value is “low” and below 30, the asset is oversold, and there is a potential upward price movement.
ADA’s RSI was 29.97 at press time, signaling that the coin was oversold. 
Source: Santiment
Prepare to ape in
To confirm whether the time is right to buy ADA, it is important to assess its Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. 
This metric tracks the ratio between an asset’s current market price and the average price of every coin or token acquired for that asset.  
A positive MVRV ratio above one signals that an asset is overvalued. It suggests that the asset’s current market value is higher than the price at which most investors acquired their holdings.
Conversely, a negative MVRV value shows that the asset is undervalued. It suggests that the market value of the asset in question is below the average purchase price of all its tokens that are in circulation. 
When an asset’s MVRV ratio is negative, it offers a buying opportunity. This is because, at its current price, the asset trades at a discount relative to its historical cost basis. 

Read Cardano’s [ADA] Price Prediction 2023-24

ADA’s MVRV ratio assessed over different moving averages returned negative values. Per Santiment’s data, the coin’s MVRV ratios on 30-day and 365-day moving averages were -13.55% and -4.5%, respectively, at the time of writing. 
ADA exchanged hands at press time at $0.44, per CoinMarketCap’s data.

Crypto Expert Weighs In On ETH/BTC Pair's Recent Decline


                            Amid turbulence surrounding the crypto market, popular founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Into The Cryptoverse Benjamin Cowen has taken the spotlight to shed his insights on the recent downtrend observed in the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair. Cowen’s views examine the complex relationship between Ethereum and Bitcoin pricing and the potential for further downside risk.
According to Benjamin Cowen, the ETH/BTC pair is currently on the downside, and the last 2 times that the pair declined, ETHUSD witnessed a steep decline of around 70%. Given that the crypto community has been eagerly anticipating an Altcoin season for the past 2.5 years, Cowen thinks it is crucial to warn the community that there is still a possibility of a downward movement.
ETH/BTC Pair Rejected By The Bull Market Band
Cowen has also confirmed that ETH/BTC is presently being rejected by the bull market support band, which he previously predicted days back due to a price pump. “I would expect it (ETH/BTC) to be rejected by the bull market support band, at least when looking at weekly closes ($0.053-$0.054),” he stated. He further noted that the pump appears to be mirroring the last cycle of rate cuts right before summer capitulation.

Following the launch of Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Cowen mentioned that ETH/BTC saw a sharp rally. The analyst affirms that the rally was probably similar to the trend of the previous bull cycle, ushering in new lows.

Furthermore, Cowen stated that there has been an unquestionable macro downtrend since November 2021, particularly following the merger of the ETH/BTC pair. However, it is also evident that the market did not decrease abruptly.
As a result, investors held ETH instead of BTC all the way down from 0.085 to 0.048 because of the multiple lower highs, giving the impression that it was holding up quite well. 
Prior to the Bitcoin Halving, Cowen predicted that the bull market support band would reject ETH/BTC, at least when considering weekly closes ($0.053-$0.054), should there be a rebound after the Halving, similar to that witnessed with BTC spot ETF launch. Regardless of what occurs, the expert is confident that ETH/BTC will reach between $0.03 and $0.04 by this summer.
Heightened Divergence Between Ethereum And Bitcoin
Being the two leading cryptocurrency assets, there is great interest surrounding Ethereum and Bitcoin. However, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has highlighted a shift in performance between both digital assets.

According to the firm, the performance of Ethereum and Bitcoin has been increasingly diverging so far in the 2023–2024 cycle. This is due to poorer performance in ETH price, which is explained by a generally weaker trend in capital rotation. In addition, this is evident when particularly compared to preceding cycles and all-time highs.

Market Expert Says Bitcoin Is Getting Ready To Rally As Major Indicators Cool Off | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin is looking to enter into the $65,000 price terrain again amidst price volatility in the past 24 hours. The latest numbers from two different metrics suggest this could become a reality soon and Bitcoin could be on track to going on a price rally. As noted by a crypto analyst on social media, the Bitcoin funding rate and basis points to a “leg up.” 
Bitcoin Is Getting Ready
According to a post on social media by Will Clemente, a popular crypto analyst, both the funding rate and 3-month annualized basis for Bitcoin are starting to cool off after briefly reaching negative readings in the past few weeks. What this means is that long-position trades for the asset are starting to dominate as investors regain confidence in its potential price action in the coming weeks.

A detailed look into the chart shared by Clemente shows that the funding rate, in particular, has been ranging in negative readings since the last week of April and reached its lowest on April 22. However, the current price action has pushed the funding rate into positive territory again. The BTC funding rate has rebounded from a negative rate of -0.0050% on May 4 to a current rate of 0.0090%, based on information from Coinglass. Interestingly, this increase in funding rate translated to a concurrent price increase for Bitcoin, with the crypto reaching as high as $64,000 on May 5. 
While the funding rate might seem low, it indicates the sentiment from investors is starting to become positive. When the funding rate is positive, traders who have long positions pay a funding fee to traders who have short positions. An increase in this funding rate means more traders are willing to pay more to maintain long positions, which in turn could cause an increase in the crypto’s price.

Similarly, Clemente noted in his analysis that the 3-month annualized rate for Bitcoin is now starting to move back up. A consequence of this is that more investors will be willing to buy spot Bitcoin and simultaneously selling a futures contract that expires in three months. Interestingly, this annualized rate is currently ranging around 5% to 10% on Binance and Bybit, which is generally a bullish signal for many investors.

The total supply of stablecoins has started rising again, which could signal that investors are getting ready to put money into Bitcoin. According to on-chain data, wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have upped their buying in the past two months.

Despite the correction for Bitcoin in April, these addresses continued to acquire more Bitcoins. Analyst Willy Woo noted that an accumulation of this size has never been seen from “high net worth Bitcoin holders” over a 2-month period.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $62,350.

Tether Eyes Expansion: Integrating with TON Network to Widen Its Stablecoin Dominance

When examining the top three blockchain platforms and their stablecoin usage, TRON transactions are heavily dominated by USDT, with a dominance of 98.2%. On TRON, USDT transfers typically range from 95 cents to approximately $2, though gas fees can vary. Meanwhile, the TON wallet is natively integrated into the Telegram app, allowing users to conduct peer-to-peer USDT transactions within the TON wallet for free. Transactions between two USDT users outside the wallet reportedly incur a network fee of 0.0145 TON, which equates to about $0.09 as of May 6 2024.

Navigating Bitcoin's Market Dynamics Through Technical Analysis

Real-time analysis of the chart of bitcoin shows that, as of early-May 2024, there was a loss of intermediate-term momentum per momentum indicators like the MACD (Moving-Average-Convergence-Divergence), which has a bearish crossover. The loss of momentum suggests that bitcoin is in a corrective phase that should persist for at least another few weeks. Downside risk can be framed by the next support on the chart, near $51,500, which is defined by a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the uptrend off the 2022 low and bolstered by a rising 200-day moving average.

In a significant move, Ripple partner Peersyst announces that new amendments to the XRPL EVMSidechain have been activated following community approval. The two amendments that have been applied will enable new transaction fees in XRP and the activation of Cosmos IBC.On May 1, Peersyst launched two new key proposals, 33 and 34, to upgrade the network, to adjust XRP fees and enable IBC and Cosmos tokens, respectively.  Amendment 33 would allow updating the network's gas price to make the configuration more similar to production environments. This step is critical for network security and scalability. Transaction fees should be minimal, comparable to Binance Smart Chain or Polygon.Amendment 34 will activate IBC channels, connecting the network to the Cosmos ecosystem and enabling cross-chain applications.The community approved the amendments ,which are now in effect following a seven-day voting period that ended on Monday, May 6. The Ripple EVM sidechain, a proof of concept extension to the XRPL protocol, is designed to bring full programmability to the XRPL ecosystem. It enables developers to deploy EVM applications on the XRPL with few changes, eliminating the requirement for network votes for each application.The EVM sidechain uses a proof of authority (PoA) consensus method and is directly connected to the XRP Ledger via the XRPL bridge. The core technology for the XRPL sidechain consensus is CometBFT, a fork of Tendermint that is a Byzantine fault-tolerant engine for blockchain development.With the new update, the XRPL EVM sidechain might become more appealing to developers who wish to test it for their applications as it is not yet available on the production Mainnet.

Are Bitcoin Whales Buying The Dip With Less Enthusiasm? - Benzinga

New on-chain data analysis suggests that while large Bitcoin BTC/USD holders, often referred to as “whales,” continue to accumulate Bitcoin during dips, the intensity of their buying appears to be waning.Accumulation Spree, But With ReservationsAccording to analysis by IntoTheBlock,, addresses holding over 1,000 BTC have been actively accumulating the cryptocurrency in recent months, particularly during price dips.This buying activity has historically been followed by short-term price increases.However, the report highlights a concerning trend: the size of each accumulation spike is decreasing.Chainlink Investors Show Accumulation Despite Price FluctuationsIntoTheBlock also shared insights into the activity surrounding Chainlink LINK/USD, a decentralized oracle network. Despite recent price movements, on-chain data from the past month reveals a negative net flow of LINK tokens from exchanges, signifying accumulation by investors. During this period, the total net outflow amounted to nearly 3.6 million LINK.This pattern could indicate a declining level of conviction among whales. While they are still buying the dip, their actions suggest a potentially reduced appetite for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions. Veteran trader Cold Blooded Shiller captured this sentiment perfectly in a tweet, stating: “$BTC with LTF hope, and the potential for HTF concerns” (LTF = short-term, HTF = long-term).Also Read: Japanese Crypto Exchange Coincheck To List On Nasdaq Listing Via SPAC MergerWhat Does This Mean for Investors?The contrasting behavior of whales and Chainlink investors highlights the importance of considering multiple data points when making investment decisions. While dwindling whale buying enthusiasm for Bitcoin presents a potential concern, on-chain accumulation of LINK suggests some investor confidence in the project’s long-term prospects.The cryptocurrency market remains highly dynamic, and staying informed about emerging trends and investor behavior is crucial for success.

How the Federal Reserve 'Prints' Money: A Guide to Quantitative Easing | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent thread on X (formerly known as Twitter), financial commentator James Lavish provided an in-depth explanation of how the Federal Reserve (Fed) “prints money” through a process called Quantitative Easing (QE). This blog post will break down Lavish’s explanation, clarifying the mechanics of QE and its impact on the money supply and economy.



James Lavish, CFA, serves as the co-Managing Partner of the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, working alongside David Foley. Bringing over a decade of diverse experience in financial management, James formerly held the role of Chief Operating Officer and Risk Manager at LKCM Alternative Management, LLC. During his tenure, he managed a hybrid public and private equity hedge fund unit, focusing on a broad spectrum of industries and company sizes. Before his time at LKCM, James co-founded Ranger Arbitrage, a global risk arbitrage hedge fund, where he also served as a managing partner. 



His extensive background in finance includes significant roles such as Head Arbitrage Trader and compliance committee officer at Carlson Capital, a $4 billion global multi-strategy hedge fund, from 1998 to 2003. James’s early career was marked by positions in risk and ADR arbitrage at Citigroup and SG Warburg, starting as a trader on the floor of the NYSE. He is a Yale University alumnus with a BA in Political Science and holds the Chartered Financial Analyst designation.



What is Quantitative Easing (QE)? 



Quantitative Easing is a monetary policy tool used by central banks, like the Federal Reserve, to stimulate the economy during times of financial stress. When traditional methods of adjusting interest rates are no longer effective (e.g., when rates are already near zero), the Fed may turn to QE to inject liquidity into the financial system.



How Does QE Work? 



As Lavish explains, the process of QE involves several steps:



The Fed announces its intention to purchase securities (usually U.S. Treasury bonds) and the amount it plans to buy.Primary dealers, which are large financial institutions that serve as intermediaries between the Fed and the market, buy these securities on behalf of the Fed.Once a purchase is made, the Fed credits the reserve accounts of the primary dealers with newly created money and adds the purchased securities to its own balance sheet.This crediting increases the total reserves of these banks, directly injecting liquidity into the banking system.



In essence, the primary dealers act as brokers, settling the trades and sending the newly created money to the sellers of the securities while transferring the securities to the Fed.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The Monopoly Game Analogy 



Lavish uses a Monopoly game analogy to illustrate the impact of QE on the money supply. Imagine a game of Monopoly where all the money has already been distributed among the players. Then, a new player joins the game with additional money from another Monopoly set. This new player starts buying properties, effectively expanding the money supply within the game. As a result, the prices of properties like Park Place and Boardwalk increase significantly.



Similarly, when the Fed engages in QE, it adds money to the financial markets that was not there before, injecting liquidity and potentially driving up asset prices.



The Relationship Between QE and the Money Supply 



Lavish points out the correlation between the Fed’s balance sheet expansion and the growth of the M2 money supply. M2 is a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money, such as savings deposits and money market securities. As the Fed purchases more securities through QE, the M2 money supply tends to rise in tandem with the expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet.



Why Not Just Print Money Directly? 



Some may wonder why the Fed doesn’t simply print money and skip the complex process of QE and Treasury borrowing. Lavish warns that such an approach would transform the U.S. into a “Banana Republic,” where unchecked money printing to fund government deficits leads to hyperinflation.



In such a scenario, the Treasury (or Congress) would spend as much as they want, and the Fed would print the necessary money to allow for that spending. This would lead to an exponential rise in prices, eroding confidence in the U.S. dollar as a store of value and, eventually, as a means of exchange. Hyperinflation would ensue, causing economic chaos and the collapse of the dollar.

Crypto, CBDCs and Stablecoins Are the Future, Says Former CFTC Chair - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsDespite heading the Digital Dollar Project as a co-founder and executive chairman, J. Christopher Giancarlo believes that CBDCs aren’t the only way forward in finance.“The sometimes fashional debate at conferences, such as this, between CBDC's and stablecoins and crypto is a complete and false choice,” Giancarlo said at the Financial Times Crypto and Digital Assets Summit earlier today. “The global future is all of the above: crypto, CBDCs, stablecoins, and more.”This is music to the ears of many crypto enthusiasts who see CBDCs as an oppressive force made by authoritarian governments or a tool to help reject crypto as a new financial standard.The Digital Dollar Project is a neutral, non-profit organization which aims to help explore digital innovation in money. The company has said it believes that the U.S. should only consider issuing a CBDC once key design elements are properly understood, to avoid security and privacy risks. It has previously laid out a plan for a digital US currency.Last November the Digital Dollar Project hosted a conference with nonpartisan international affairs organization Atlantic Council, which gathered international policymakers, privacy advocates, central bankers, and more.“After those three days, two things were abundantly clear. Digital currency networks, both sovereign and non sovereign and centralized and decentralized are coming very fast,” Giancarlo explained at the conference. “And two: The time for global standards, dare I say enlightened democratic standards, is now.”Looking across the globe, he sees political and social division fueling wars. As a result, Giancarlo sees the financial system, as we know it today, beginning to change.“What some people call Pax Americana is gradually yielding to a 21st century worldwide kaleidoscope of overlapping and partially interoperable digital networks of value,” Giancarlo explained. “Some will be decentralized like Bitcoin, and others will be variously centralized and operated by global banks and big tech companies. And others will be deployed by national governments.”With this future, many people across the political spectrum, Giancarlo said, are concerned about the troves of financial data that could be accessed by governments, banks, and big tech. This is often why people fear CBDCs—they believe they’ll be used for surveillance or even to deny financial transitions.“That's why regardless of the form of digital currency—sovereign or non sovereign, CBDC, or stablecoin—it's imperative that free society thoughtfully consider privacy implications,” Giancarlo said, “and insist that the emergence of digital networks of value be consistent with key norms, constitutional freedoms, and civil rights.”The Digital Dollar Project believes the future of digital currency—both CBDCs, stable coins, and crypto—is one that can enhance the free world. But in order to do so, the public and private sectors must work together as they did with the internet (see: the Internet Society, ICANN, and more).“Let's not be intimidated by this innovation, but see it to enhance the dignity of our fellow men and women.” Giancarlo said to close his keynote, “Let's shape the future of finance, banking and money itself, in accordance with our finest and noblest human values.”Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Vitalik Buterin Announced That A New Update Is Required For Ethereum's Security! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Ethereum is preparing for a major update that could make it more secure against potential threats posed by quantum computing.

This update focuses on a new offering called EIP-7702, put forward by Vitalik Buterin. This proposal may be considered an improvement over the previous proposal by addressing some specific technical issues related to signing processes that were previously considered limitations.

According to Vitalik Buterin, This Ethereum Update is Critical for the Future
However, a major topic of discussion in the community is the real threat of quantum computing. Some argue that quantum computing is often used as a scare tactic without real solutions being offered.


For example, developer James Prestwich pointed out that if quantum computing were truly an imminent threat, tougher measures would be necessary right now. Prestwich states that it is not very useful to bring up the issue of quantum computing without proposing concrete steps for a solution.
The risk that quantum computing poses to existing encryption methods, such as those used in Ethereum, is significant.






If quantum technology advances enough to break these methods, it could potentially put the entire system at risk. Therefore, there is an urgent call to start moving away from the current encryption standard ECDSA, which is a key security element in many of Ethereum's transactions.

Vitalik Buterin has been proactive in addressing these concerns in the past. He has been developing codes for wallets that are resistant to quantum attacks since 2017, and these codes can be seen in his public works on GitHub.

Its approach includes a focus on advanced cryptographic methods known as STARK protocols. These are seen as a promising defense against quantum attacks.


Buterin advises that the best course of action is to continue improving these protocols and make sure that any new developments in Ethereum are compatible with a future where quantum resilience is required.

What do crypto market makers actually do? Liquidity, or manipulation


            
Few ordinary crypto holders understand the role of market makers.At the simplest level, market makers provide liquidity to keep assets tradable in the cryptocurrency market, ensuring that if a user tries to buy or sell a coin on a particular exchange, they’re usually able to.



However, unethical market makers also manipulate token prices, inflate volumes and conduct pump and dumps.



Mathias Beke, Kairon Labs



Many cryptocurrency projects hire them to goose their performance metrics using strategies like wash trading, which is where entities repeatedly trade the same asset back and forth to create the illusion of volume. In traditional markets, this is illegal market manipulation, misleading investors about the demand for a particular asset.



“A lot of [token] projects are fooling their own trader community or investors by faking these wash trades or these volumes,” says Mathias Beke, co-founder and head of trading at Belgium-based market maker Kairon Labs.



He adds that these cowboys give legitimate market makers a bad name but says global regulatory developments are progressively making it more difficult for such businesses to thrive.



Hard data on the extent of wash trading is difficult to come by. Bitwise famously reported in 2019 that 95% of the volume on unregulated exchanges was fake. A more recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in December 2022 found that the figure had eased to around 70%.



Yang Yang, a co-author of the NBER study, tells Magazine that properly regulated exchanges accounted for less than 3% of spot market transactions, according to the research.



Regulated exchanges, as defined under New York’s crypto BitLicense, comply with stringent requirements around Anti-Money Laundering programs and customer information record-keeping, and they have a disaster recovery system.



Since BitLicense debuted in New York, other financial hubs around the world — such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai — have enforced strict licensing requirements of their own.



“In an unregulated exchange, you can immediately spot that their economic indicators are so far away from the regulated market,” Yang says.And that’s where the illicit market makers ply their dark trade.






Market makers and liquidity provision



It’s important to differentiate between the two main types of market makers. Exchange market makers focus on creating a stable, liquid trading environment for a particular cryptocurrency exchange. 



Token market makers, by contrast, are often engaged by the issuers of the tokens themselves. Their primary objective is to ensure liquidity for a specific token, particularly in its early stages or during periods of low trading volume.



This type of market-making can help newer tokens gain traction and visibility in a crowded market.



Jelle Buth, Enflux



But what some token projects hope to get from market makers and what the legitimate firms provide are often at odds.



“Generally, what [token projects] look for is they think that a market maker is there to create volume, increase price and do pump and dumps,” Jelle Buth, co-founder of market maker Enflux, tells Magazine. 



“But that is completely incorrect.”



He explains that a market maker’s role is to make assets tradable by providing liquidity and maintaining a healthy order book, which contains all the buy and sell orders for an asset. 



By placing orders on both sides of the book, they ensure that there’s always a match available for incoming orders, which enhances the asset’s liquidity.



Market makers offer to buy (bid) and sell (ask) a crypto asset at different prices. The difference between these two prices is known as the spread.



A narrower spread generally indicates a more liquid market, whereas a wider spread suggests less liquidity and higher trading costs.




“It’s a market maker’s role to make this as tight as possible, while of course keeping in mind it not being a largely loss-making activity.”




A narrow bid-ask spread is often accompanied by solid market depth, which refers to the available quantity of buy and sell orders at different price levels within an order book at a given moment.



Market depth can also gauge an asset’s ability to absorb large orders without significant price shifts.



A market maker is expected to maintain liquidity without compromising profits.

According to Buth, there are two primary business models for token projects: the service model, where market makers receive set payments for creating a liquid trading environment, and the loan option model.



In a loan option model, a market maker borrows a certain amount of tokens from a crypto project with an agreement the tokens are initially priced at a set rate. These tokens are used to provide liquidity but often come with a primary goal of turning a profit, Buth says.



Market manipulation and loan option incentives



For instance, consider a market maker that borrows 100,000 tokens from a cryptocurrency project at $1 per token. 



This isn’t just a straightforward loan. It comes with a built-in option for the market maker to settle the loan at the end of an agreed period by returning an equivalent number of tokens at the same price of $1 each, regardless of the current market price. 



During the loan period, the market maker sells these tokens in the open market to provide liquidity, potentially profiting if the token price rises.



Ideally, the market maker would have retained the proceeds from selling the tokens at higher market prices during the loan period. 



At the end of the loan period, they can use some of these proceeds to buy back the tokens at the current market price if needed, or they might already have the tokens available to return. They can then settle the loan at $1 per token, which can be profitable if the repurchase price is less than the sale price during the loan period.






This allows them to cover their obligation while potentially making a profit. It also allows the market maker to manage their risk by knowing in advance the maximum price they will need to pay to return the borrowed tokens, while the token issuer benefits from the liquidity and market presence during the loan period.



The downside of the loan option for projects is the lack of control over their own tokens. Buth says:




“I’m not saying they always do, but there is an incentive for them to trade unethically [and] manipulate markets in order to reap the most profits, rather than there being an incentive to create a healthy market or trading environment.” 




According to Buth, market makers under the token loan model may even artificially suppress the price of a token before the agreement expires, aiming to renew the partnership at a lower price.



“The moment the agreement is renewed, they allow the price to go up significantly,” Buth adds.



The “unethical” market makers



The operator of one of the less salubrious market-making firms, who wishes to remain anonymous — let’s call them MM — says that exchanges have incentivized the use of unethical market makers.



“Exchanges have unspoken requirements where the project must exceed a certain amount of daily trading volume, and this creates an incentive for projects to inflate their trading volumes,” according to MM.



MM says token projects approach their services to list on exchanges, whether that be on decentralized or centralized platforms.






The source declines to elaborate on how a listing is achieved but says their market maker does things “competitors don’t.”



According to screenshots of documents seen by Magazine, some of the services MM offers, or offered, include unethical and potentially illegal tactics to boost price and volume, such as front-running news events and wash trading.



This is “clearly unethical,” Beke of Kairon Labs says of the tactics, and he refuses to call businesses that provide such services “market makers.”



“This, in the long run, will only hurt investors and traders because they are caught up in these volatile moves,” says Beke, adding that potential clients are often disappointed when his firm doesn’t offer volume and price-pumping services.



Exchanges crack down on shadowy crypto market makers



Asal Alizade, head of operations at Web3 consulting firm Blocklogica, confirms MM’s contention that trading volume is one of the most important factors for projects to get listed on centralized exchanges. However, exchanges are also on the lookout for manipulation.



“In top-tier exchanges, if the project doesn’t maintain the requirements and can’t fulfill the minimum trading volume for a specific period, or doesn’t meet the terms and conditions of that exchange and shows unethical practices such as pumping and dumping the token, or manipulating the price, the token will be delisted,” Alizade tells Magazine.



Buth says exchange listing requirements also contribute to healthy markets. (Unsplash)



“Top-tier exchanges will not only check the legal documents of the token, including licenses and legal opinion but also check the organic community of the project and evaluate the strength of this community, including the project’s social channels,” she adds.



The exchanges Magazine speaks with outline proactive steps they take to weed out bad actors. 



“The crypto ecosystem is highly competitive, and it’s not uncommon for participants to fabricate data to stay ahead of the curve,” Ryan Lee, chief analyst of Bitget Research, tells Magazine.



“On Bitget, the trading volumes are real, including transactions from retail traders, institutional clients and market makers. One of our predominant strategies to prevent wash trading is an updated platform algorithm that strikes out any form of price indifference,” Lee says.



Vivien Lin, chief product officer of crypto exchange BingX, tells Magazine that crypto platforms are deploying better monitoring systems to identify and mitigate suspicious trading as a result of more regulated entities joining the market. 






“At BingX, we’ve heightened rule enforcement and introduced strict penalties for breaches, in addition to enhancing clearing and settlement processes to combat wash trades,” Lin says.



Bitget declined to comment when asked if exchanges have listing fees or penalties for projects that fail to maintain a certain level of trading volume. BingX says it does not charge listing fees or impose volume requirements.



For ordinary users, it’s difficult to determine the extent of wash trading at any given time. CoinGecko CEO Bobby Ong tells Magazine that the aggregator does not have its own internal mechanism to filter out wash-traded volume. CoinMarketCap did not respond.



Regulations may curb wash trading and other dark practices



The European Union has introduced its Markets in Crypto-Assets regulatory framework, which was published on June 9, 2023, in the Official Journal of the European Union and took effect 20 days later. Full compliance is required by Dec. 30, 2024.







MiCA prohibits behaviors considered market manipulation, including conducting transactions that give false or misleading signals about a crypto asset’s supply, demand or price. Wash trading falls under this definition.



“No one can advertise this due to regulations like MiCA,” MM says. “Most market makers are regulated now, so you will start seeing less and less of [unethical services], but there are bad actors out there that will always be willing to do anything a client asks for.”



Buth of Enflux believes that dodgy market makers will simply move offshore.



“I think that regulation is for sure good, [and] it should move there, but I still think there are always ways as long as there’s demand for unethical practices,” Buth says.

FTX Claimants Will Get Their Solana NFTs Back-But FTT Holders Get Nothing - Decrypt

FTX’s bankruptcy estate announced Tuesday that creditors and customers are likely to receive between $14.5 billion to $16.3 billion in total compensation—but that doesn’t include payouts for holders of FTX’s ill-fated FTT token.Once regarded as the defunct exchange’s native token on Ethereum, allowed claims regarding FTT are to be “canceled or released,” a plan filed in Delaware bankruptcy court states. Conversely, those with NFTs currently trapped in the FTX NFT platform due to the company’s collapse are set to receive the assets back.Around 98% of FTX creditors with allowed claims less than $50,000 will also receive 118% of what they're owed if the plan receives court approval. Based on the USD value of crypto prices when FTX buckled in 2022, the payment represents a little interest on top of funds customers lost 18 months ago, when crypto prices were broadly much lower than they are now.Creditors and customers who lost FTT in FTX’s collapse were previously set to receive cash payments based on their holdings, according to an FTX reorganization plan filed last December. The plan also stipulates that NFT-related claims would see their corresponding JPEGs returned.FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was handed a 25-year prison sentence in March for stealing $8 billion from customers, among other misdeeds. The disgraced crypto wunderkind secretly siphoned billions of dollars from the exchange to purchase Bahamian real estate, bankroll venture investments, and amass influence through political donations.Most of Bankman-Fried’s wealth, which topped out at an estimated $26.5 billion, was made up of ownership in FTX and FTT, per Bankman-Fried’s profile on Forbes. Among the NFTs impacted by FTX’s collapse are Solana NFTs minted by the platform itself, including those offered by concert festivals Coachella and Tomorrowland, NBA star Steph Curry’s 2974 NFT collection, and Formula One-themed NFTs from the Mercedes-AMG Petronas racing team.FTT’s collapse is synonymous with the fatal tailspin that wrecked FTX in November 2022. A report from CoinDesk revealed that Alameda Research, a trading firm owned by Bankman-Fried, held $4 billion worth of FTT on its balance sheet at the time. After Changpeng Zhao, founder and then-CEO of Binance, moved to sell the exchange’s FTT holdings, the token nosedived, sparking a flood of investors withdrawing cash from FTX. Failing to process withdrawals, that eventually forced FTX to admit it didn’t hold 1:1 reserves of customer assets.The day FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, FTT traded hands at $2.62, down 97% from its 2021 all-time high of $80.50. Jumping occasionally since then on bankruptcy-related remarks, FTT is currently worth $2.14, according to CoinGecko.Aside from being used to inflate the balance sheets of Bankman-Fried’s business empire, the one-time crypto mogul leveraged FTT in some business dealings. That includes a $30 million payment made almost entirely of FTT to the former NFL star Tom Brady and his ex-wife, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, for appearing in several FTX commercials.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

BTC adoption alert: Argentina's largest electricity company to mine Bitcoin


Argentina’s largest electricity company, YPF Luz, has entered into an agreement with Genesis Digital Assets Limited (GDA). The partnership will establish a new Bitcoin (BTC) mining facility in the Bajo del Toro Thermal Power Plant, with 1,200 mining machines that use stranded gas for power generation.
According to YPF Luz CEO Martín Mandarano—as reported by Forbes on May 7—the company has been generating electricity from mining since 2022. In this new partnership, the facility will have a total capacity of 7 MW, with an additional 1 MW backup. GDA Executive President Abdumalik Mirakhmedov stated that Argentina’s pro-innovation climate for crypto has never been stronger.
Furthermore, Mirakhmedov highlighted the significant portion of Argentina’s population that already uses cryptocurrencies and stablecoins as inflation hedges.



“Although we’ve been considering expanding to Argentina for years, the political and pro-innovation climate the country has fostered for crypto – and Bitcoin specifically – has never been stronger than today. There’s also a large percentage of the population in Argentina that already uses cryptocurrencies and stablecoins to hedge against high inflation. The bottom line is that crypto is a solution to these problems, and we’re seeing that fact recognized by countries throughout Central and South America.”
Abdumalik Mirakhmedov

Bitcoin mining potential in Argentina
Writing for Forbes, Javier Bastardo believes the new facility demonstrates Bitcoin mining’s potential to mitigate the environmental impact of stranded gas while generating valuable returns. Importantly, according to the report, this initiative will not compromise the electricity needed for Argentina’s internal demand.

“The new facility showcases two important elements of bitcoin mining’s potential. On one hand, it helps mitigate the direct impact of stranded gas on the environment. However, other mitigation techniques don’t include the second element: using these wasted resources to make some valuable return, in this case, through BTC. What is more significant in terms of the scalability of this kind of initiative is that it won’t compromise the electricity needed to cover Argentina’s internal demand.”
– Javier Bastardo for Forbes

In addition, GDA sees Argentina as an ideal starting point for its regional expansion in Latin America. The company is actively seeking more countries in the region to expand to, citing attractive electricity prices, temperature, development potential, and sustainable energy sources as key factors. Since Javier Milei took power in late 2023, Argentina’s Bitcoin and crypto industry has grown significantly.
So far, the public sector is working on regulating the activity to comply with international standards and requirements. Meanwhile, companies, startups, and users are exploring ways to maintain the country’s increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies. GDA’s announcement underscores the importance Argentina may have for the Bitcoin mining industry in the coming years.
Low revenue to mine Bitcoin
On the other hand, Bitcoin miners have been facing record-low revenue due to the block subsidy halving on April 20. Essentially, mining companies now receive half the amount of BTC for the same production cost.
However, the production cost has also increased, making the situation even worse for smaller players willing to mine Bitcoin.
Therefore, electricity giants like YPF Luz, operating in low-cost environments like Argentina, have competitive advantages over other industry participants. For this reason, this reported partnership is paramount for Bitcoin’s network security sustainability under these current challenges.

Disney, Uber, Starbucks, And McDonald's Send A Powerful Signal To Investors But Momo Crowd Oblivious - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) - Benzinga

To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.Consumer Pulling BackPlease click here for an enlarged chart of Walt Disney Co DIS.Note the following:
	This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of DIS is being used to illustrate the point.
	The chart shows the drop in DIS stock on earnings.
	Overall, Disney earnings were good. The reason the stock was hit is because Disney projects operating income for its Experiences segment which consists of parks will show no growth in the June quarter vs. a consensus of 12% growth. Theme parks are important for Disney as they account for 52% of its operating profit.
	The Arora Report’s detailed analysis of Disney’s earnings and conference call indicates that the consumer is now resisting high park prices and is pulling back.
	This morning, the stock of ride hailing and food delivery company Uber Technologies Inc UBER is falling.  In The Arora Report analysis, the main reason behind the drop in UBER stock is that the consumer is pulling back.
	On May 6, the big meat producer Tyson Foods Inc TSN fell after reporting earnings. The Arora Report’s analysis of earnings show that the consumer is pulling back.
	On April 30, Starbucks Corp SBUX fell after reporting earnings. In The Arora Report’s analysis of the earnings and conference call, the main reason behind SBUX earnings shortfall is that the consumer is pulling back.
	On April 30, McDonald's Corp MCD reported earnings. The earnings showed flat to declining trends.  n The Arora Report analysis, the reason is that the consumer is becoming price wary.
	The foregoing is just a sampling. The Arora Report analysis of earnings so far shows that the consumer pulling back is impacting a large number of companies.
	Further, The Arora Report analysis shows that about 60% of consumers are pulling back, but the remaining 40% are still on a spending binge.
	As a member of The Arora Report, none of the foregoing should surprise you – we have been sharing with you that liquidity of consumers at the low end was drying up.
	The U.S. economy avoided a recession for two reasons:
	
		Excessive consumer spending that was triggered by the free money from the government. This factor is now abating.
		Excessive fiscal spending by the U.S. government.  This spending continues.
	
	
	The consumer pulling back impacts earnings. However, in The Arora Report analysis, so far Wall Street analysts have not properly adjusted their earnings estimates. By next quarter, they will need to adjust their estimates. Prudent investors need to get ahead of upcoming reductions in earrings estimates.
	It is important to remember that there are three other factors driving this stock market higher:
	
		Exuberance over AI.  Yesterday we shared with you real examples of NVIDIA Corp NVDA and Palantir Technologies Inc PLTR. For the first time, smart money is willing to take on the momo crowd. In The Arora Report analysis, a fortune is to be made from artificial intelligence between now and 2030.  However, in the short term, the move up in many stocks is overdone. Again, prudent investors need to look ahead and not just through the rearview mirror.
		The Fed’s second blunder that has dramatically eased financial conditions. Here, prudent investors need to carefully watch on an ongoing basis, as Powell appears to be itching to compound his blunder. The thinking in some conservative circles is that Powell’s stance when the data does not justify it is to help with Biden’s reelection. Trump has already stated that he will not reappoint Powell. The Arora Report is politically neutral. Our sole job is to help investors. Having said that, it is important that investors do not let their politics get in the way of making money.
		Reckless fiscal spending by the U.S. government. The spending continues with no sign of abating.
	
	
	The stock market always has crosscurrents. Powell’s actions and fiscal spending will likely lead to more buying of stocks, even though other factors seem to be at the cusp of turning.

Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash.  A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.  It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.  When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Traditional 60/40 PortfolioProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

Transaction Fees To The Rescue! Bitcoin Miners Find Solace In Network Activity


								For years, Bitcoin miners have toiled away, fueled by the promise of block rewards – newly minted coins earned for validating transactions. But a recent trend is changing the game, with transaction fees quietly usurping block rewards as the primary source of miner income. This shift, while unexpected, presents both opportunities and challenges for the future of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin: Transaction Fees On The Rise
Ki Young Ju, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis firm CryptoQuant, recently highlighted a significant change in the Bitcoin mining landscape. Transaction fees, once a minor contributor to miner income, have seen a dramatic rise. According to CryptoQuant’s data, transaction fees now account for over 7% of miners’ total income, a stark contrast to the meager 1% reported just two years ago.


A Boon For Network Stability?
This surge in transaction fees isn’t just about boosting miner profits; it has the potential to significantly impact the overall health of the BTC network. The increasing number of applications built on the Bitcoin blockchain translates to more transactions and, consequently, higher fee revenue for miners.
This, in turn, could incentivize continued mining activity even as block rewards get halved roughly every four years – a pre-programmed mechanism designed to control the total supply of Bitcoin.

The Double-Edged Sword Of Fees
The rise of transaction fees presents a double-edged sword for Bitcoin. While it offers miners a more sustainable income stream and potentially strengthens network security, it also raises concerns about transaction speed and user experience.
As miners prioritize maximizing profits, they might be tempted to favor transactions with higher fees, leading to slower processing times for regular users and potentially driving up overall transaction costs.

A Ripple Effect Across The Ecosystem
The changing dynamics of crypto mining extend beyond just miners. A fee-driven network could have a ripple effect across the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. Investors and users might need to adjust their strategies as transaction costs fluctuate. The valuation of the crypto asset itself could also be impacted, with increased fees potentially deterring new users from entering the market.

Navigating The New Frontier
The rise of transaction fees marks a new frontier for Bitcoin. While it presents exciting possibilities for miner profitability and network stability, it also necessitates careful consideration of potential drawbacks.
Finding the right balance between miner incentives and user experience will be crucial for Bitcoin’s continued success. Stakeholders across the ecosystem, from miners and developers to investors and users, will need to adapt and innovate to ensure a future for Bitcoin that is secure, efficient, and accessible to all.

Why Ethereum traders are starting to bet big against ETH's price - AMBCrypto



Short positions increase following Grayscale’s decision to pull its Ethereum futures ETF application.
Market sentiment grows bearish with potential further declines.

Ethereum [ETH], the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has recently shown a lack of significant upward momentum, contrasting with Bitcoin’s [BTC] recent surge. 
Although Ethereum reached over $4,000 in March, it failed to set a new all-time high, unlike Bitcoin, which soared to a new peak in the same period.
In the last two weeks, Ethereum has seen nearly a 10% decline, and this downward trend has continued in the last 24 hours, with a 2.2% drop.
 This bearish sentiment is reflected in the actions of Ethereum traders, who have been increasing their short positions, particularly after a significant development from Grayscale Investments.
Grayscale’s strategic withdrawal
Grayscale Investments recently withdrew its application for an Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), a move that has significantly impacted trader sentiment. 
This decision, made just three weeks before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was due to deliver its verdict, has led to an increase in short positions on Ethereum. 
Traders are currently betting heavily on further declines, with $358 million in short positions poised for liquidation if prices rise by just 4%. 
Conversely, a 4% drop would only eliminate $237 million in long positions.
Source: Coinglass
This withdrawal aligns with broader concerns about Ethereum’s regulatory status, particularly regarding its classification as a security and the fate of spot Ethereum ETFs. 
As the decision date — the 23rd of May — approaches, analysts and market participants are growing increasingly skeptical about the approval of these ETFs. 
According to Polymarket, over 90% of participants believe that the spot Ethereum ETF will be denied.
Source: Polymarket
How is Ethereum doing?
Beyond ETF concerns, Ethereum faces issues with its overall usage and a lack of speculative interest, especially from short-term holders. 
James Check, a noted crypto on-chain analyst, pointed out that Ethereum’s usage is so low that its burn mechanism cannot keep up with issuance to validators. 
This sentiment was echoed by Glassnode, which highlighted Ethereum’s underperformance relative to Bitcoin due to a lag in speculative interest from these short-term holders.

Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025

From a technical perspective, Ethereum’s price is expected to continue its downward trajectory until it reaches a swing low liquidity near $2,800. 
This is because Ethereum’s price has recently touched a breaker block, and the next target is to hit the major swing low on the 4-hour chart.

Fundstrat CEO Predicts When Bitcoin Price Will Reach $150,000 And $500,000


                            Thomas Jong Lee, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Fundstrat, an independent financial research boutique, has maintained a bullish stance on Bitcoin. The financial analyst has predicted that the world’s largest cryptocurrency could surge massively, doubling its current price to reach $150,000 during the 2024 crypto market cycle. 
Bitcoin Could Go Parabolic In 2024
During a recent interview on Squawk Box, CNBC on May 7, Lee doubled down on his previous Bitcoin forecast, expressing strong confidence that the pioneering cryptocurrency would experience a dramatic surge before the end of 2024. He predicts that Bitcoin, currently priced at $62,371, according to CoinMarketCap, will exceed previous all-time highs and reach $150,000. 
Related Reading: Can Ethereum Reclaim $4,000? Fragile Fundamentals Threaten To Send ETH Crashing
The Fundstrat CEO disclosed earlier in April in an interview with CNBC Television, that “Bitcoin would definitely make new all-time highs this year,” predicting that the cryptocurrency could surge to $150,000 in 2024, and $500,000 long term. 
He highlighted that the strong demand for BTC has been fueling its price increase. Furthermore, the integration of the Rune Protocol, a new token standard for issuing fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network, has also bolstered the blockchain’s network. 
Lee’s ambitious forecast of Bitcoin comes at a time when the market has been experiencing significant volatility and periods of fluctuations. Bitcoin previously surged to an all-time high above $73,000 in March, propelled by the hype and demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs.
However, after Bitcoin halving on April 20, which many analysts and investors believed would trigger another price rally, BTC witnessed a dramatic drop, falling as low as $57,000 at some point in May. 
Despite the upheaval in the broader crypto market, Lee remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term value. His unwavering confidence in the cryptocurrency’s robust price fundamentals is reflected in his expectations of a potential price surge to or even exceeding half a million in the coming years. 
Factors Point To Upward Momentum After FED Rate Cut
While Lee made his bullish projections about Bitcoin, he also discussed the present inflationary situation and economic conditions of the United States. According to the Fundstrat CEO, inflation in the US is set to cool off dramatically, potentially triggering an upward momentum for Bitcoin if this happens.

The CEO disclosed that the Federal Reserve (FED) currently has more leeway to cut rates, citing their impacts on the country’s banking balance sheet. Although he refrained from specifying a precise timeline for the drop in the US inflation rate, Lee indicated that it could potentially occur by the second half of 2024. 
Overall, the Fundstrat CEO has maintained an optimistic outlook for inflationary pressures in the US, with Bitcoin typically serving as a hedge against inflation and a store of value during these periods of economic uncertainty.

Scoop: Justin Sun shot down BitTorrent moderation despite porn concerns


Justin Sun, whose Rainberry LLC acquired BitTorrent in 2018, pushed a no-moderation policy at the file-sharing giant, as stated in documents received by Protos.
According to a deposition by former BitTorrent CEO, Jordy Berson, Sun regularly lied to the Apple and Google App stores, not only about moderation on his apps, but also about the 30% cut of sales promised to Apple once listed.
In the deposition, Berson repeatedly discusses how numerous employees, including himself, wanted Sun to implement some level of moderation on the ‘BT Live’ product — planned for launch in India and China in early 2019 — but were always advised against any moderation.
Berson claims that Sun’s catchphrase soon became “It will be fine. Let me worry about that.”
Meetings in India and China
The product was initially intended to be developed and built by a US team but first launched in India; a major market for BitTorrent. TRON maintained a headquarters in Beijing, China, where executives from China and North America would meet to discuss new concepts and how they could be implemented.
It’s unknown if TRON still has any office space in China.
During this time, it’s clear that Sun was a micromanager at BT Live, with Berson stating that “even though [some budgets were as little as] $5,000… Justin needed to approve [them].” Sun also had a nasty habit of agreeing to a budget and then backing out of the agreement at the last second.

Dark Side of the (Justin) Sun: Money, it’s a crime
In the deposition, Berson states, “Justin communicated to me that users wanted an unmoderated experience; that the product would be more popular, would get more users if we allowed any kind of content in the product.”
According to Berson, despite numerous individuals proclaiming their fear that BT Live would inadvertently be aiding in the distribution of ‘elicit pornography, and, in particular, child pornography,‘ Sun ‘mentioned with conviction that [BT Live] should not have moderation.’
Sun’s plan to skirt by without moderation on the platform amounted to what he described as ‘two boxes’ — one box at the top of the app when you open it, featuring ‘PG content’ and a second box that would require users to scroll far down before encountering the unmoderated content.
Sun also wanted users to tip content uploaders using his currency BitTorrent token.
If and when BT Live was taken down from app stores due to a lack of moderation, Berson said, Sun’s… plan was to do what he often did and “temporarily fix the issue” only to “go back and unfix it so it was more about whether or not they (Apple and Google) noticed rather than whether we had to [have a moderation policy] or not.”
“Sun wanted a place where the users could do elicit activity, including… child pornography,” Berson added.
Besides creating a toxic work environment wherein many employees were either fired for perceived insubordination or resigned due to not wanting to be involved with such terrible content moderation policies, BT Live was yet another example of decentralization theater from Justin Sun.
According to one longtime cryptocurrency executive on background, “It’s almost like an admission that he’s LARPing on a protocol level” with BitTorrent seemingly having the ability to moderate its databases but choosing not to — partially due to Sun’s desires, but also to present the appearance of no control.
Protos reached out to Sun for comment and will update the story if he replies.

Hackers With $182,000,000 Stolen From Poloniex Starts Moving Funds to Tornado Cash - The Daily Hodl


								The hacker who looted the crypto exchange Poloniex has started moving Ethereum (ETH) to the mixing service Tornado Cash, according to the digital asset de-anonymizing platform Arkham.
Arkham notes the hacker moved 1126.1 ETH worth more than $3.4 million into Tornado Cash across a series of 20 transactions on Monday and Tuesday.










They represent the exploiter’s first moves into the controversial Ethereum-based crypto mixer, which helps users conceal their digital assets.
The hacker raided Poloniex in early November, stealing $56 million worth of ETH, $48 million worth of Tron (TRX) and $18 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC), as well as smaller amounts of other crypto assets.
The exchange, which is owned by Tron founder Justin Sun, offered a 5% white hat bounty that went unaccepted. and the hacker still holds $181.47 million worth of crypto in their primary address, according to Arkham.
Justin Sun-affiliated projects have endured a prolific string of attacks in the past several months:  In September, hackers exploited the Sun-linked exchange giant HTX for approximately 4,999 Ethereum worth $7.9 million, according to the blockchain security firm PeckShield.
Then in November, hackers hit HTX and Heco Bridge, another Sun-linked project that’s used to move funds between Ethereum and energy-saving blockchain Heco Chain, for a combined $100 million, according to cybersecurity firm Cyvers.
And in January, hackers once again struck HTX, hitting the exchange with a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that caused a brief outage.
A DDoS attack is a malicious attempt by bad actors to flood the target website with traffic to overwhelm the site’s infrastructure.

Polkadot rolls out asynchronous backing to boost network efficiency and transaction speed

Polkadot has implemented asynchronous backing, a pivotal upgrade enhancing the network’s flexibility in blockspace allocation and overall performance.The upgrade is one of the three technological advancements, alongside Elastic Scaling and Agile Coretime, driving the blockchain towards its Polkadot 2.0 vision.Asynchronous BackingAccording to Polkadot, asynchronous backing provides an optimized approach for validating parachain blocks by its relay chain.The blockchain said the upgrade would introduce a twofold acceleration in blockspace production time and a 3-5x increase in extrinsic per block. It would also lead to heightened utilization of parachain blocks and is projected to enhance blockspace availability by 6-10x.Furthermore, asynchronous backing would also result in an 8-fold increase in throughput while upholding security standards. This enhancement is expected to support decentralized applications, catering to diverse sectors like Web3 gaming and DeFi.PolkaWorld, a social media account focused on the Polkadot network, further explained:“Asynchronous backing greatly increases the system’s flexibility and efficiency, allowing more transactions to be processed in a shorter time, thereby enhancing the overall throughput and responsiveness of the network.”DOT price unchangedPolkadot’s asynchronous support didn’t significantly affect DOT’s price, which experienced a slight 1.16% decline in the last 24 hours, settling at $7.06 at press time, according to CryptoSlate’s data.This represents a reversal of fortunes for a digital asset whose value had increased by around 10% during the past week amid a broader market performance.Notably, crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe recently described Polkadot as one of the leading layer1 networks still heavily undervalued.According to him:“Polkadot is the second largest blockchain in terms of developers and growth, while the price is still lagging behind. It might the last time it does this, as it aims to provide a solution for the scalability and security issues Ethereum is facing.”Disclaimer: CryptoSlate has received a grant from the Polkadot Foundation to produce content about the Polkadot ecosystem.

Coincheck, Thunder Bridge move closer to Nasdaq listing with public filing

Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck and Thunder Bridge Capital have taken one step closer to the completion of their merger transaction and Nasdaq listing.According to a May 7 press release, the companies filed their registration statement on Form F-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, marking a milestone in their two-year journey toward a planned public offering. Over the past months, the companies filed multiple confidential drafts of the registration statement with the SEC, allowing for revisions based on comments. The Form F-4 is required by the commission for business transactions involving foreign companies.Initially disclosed in March 2022, the proposed business combination aims to make Coincheck a publicly traded entity through a de-SPAC transaction with Thunder Bridge. At the time, the merger deal was reported at $1.25 billion. Monex Group statement. Source: Monex GroupA de-SPAC occurs when a private company merges with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) — an entity created specifically to find and acquire private businesses. Companies seek de-SPAC transactions because they may provide a faster path to public markets than traditional initial public offerings. The merger was initially expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2022, but the severe bear market and regulatory uncertainties following the collapse of FTX in November of that year likely delayed its completion.The business combination is now expected to be completed in the second or third quarter of 2024, pending shareholder approval and regulatory clearance from the SEC. The new holding company will operate under the name Coincheck Group, N.V. Its stock will trade under the ticker symbol CNCK on the Nasdaq. Coincheck is one of the largest crypto exchanges in Japan. Monex Group, the crypto exchange’s parent company, reported over 2 billion yen (roughly $14 million) in profits from crypto trading in the first quarter of 2024. Monex acquired Coincheck in 2018 after the crypto exchange suffered a major hack, in which approximately $534 million in NEM tokens were stolen.Magazine: Bitcoin ETFs make Coinbase a ‘honeypot’ for hackers and governments — Trezor CEO

In April 2024, Crypto Derivatives Trading Volume on the CME Falls 19.8% | Cryptoglobe


                                
CCData, authorized by the FCA as a benchmark administrator, stands as a global leader in digital asset data. It serves both institutional and retail investors by providing high-quality, real-time, and historical data. With a proven track record in data expertise, CCData offers thought-leadership reports and analytics that deliver objective insights into the digital asset industry.



The CCData Exchange Review meticulously tracks significant developments within the cryptocurrency exchange market. This review encompasses detailed analyses of exchange volumes, focusing on aspects such as crypto derivatives trading, market segmentation by exchange fee models, and comparisons between crypto-to-crypto and fiat-to-crypto volumes. It also includes examinations of Bitcoin trading across various fiat currencies and stablecoins, a ranking of top crypto exchanges by spot trading volume, and historical volume trends of top trans-fee mining and decentralized exchanges. Published monthly, the CCData Exchange Review is designed for a wide audience ranging from crypto enthusiasts seeking a comprehensive market overview to investors, analysts, and regulators looking for in-depth analysis.



April 2024 has marked a significant shift in cryptocurrency trading dynamics, as detailed in the latest edition of CCData’s Exchange Review. Following a robust period in March, the combined volume of spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges experienced a sharp decline of 43.8%, totaling $6.58 trillion. This downturn can be attributed to a confluence of factors, including unexpected macroeconomic data, increased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and negative net flows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs.



Impact of Bitcoin Halving and Macroeconomic Factors



The report pinpoints the Bitcoin halving event as a pivotal moment that influenced trading behaviors significantly. Historically a catalyst for increased market activity, this year’s halving coincided with a drop in investor confidence and a decrease in market liquidity, contributing to the reduction in trading volumes. The geopolitical crisis and unsettling macroeconomic data further exacerbated the market’s retreat, reversing many of the gains seen in the previous month.



Specifics of Trading Volume Declines



On centralized exchanges, monthly spot trading volumes fell by 32.6% to $2.01 trillion, marking the first decline in seven months. 











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Derivatives trading was hit even harder, with volumes plummeting by 47.6% to $4.57 trillion. Consequently, derivatives market dominance decreased to 69.5%, continuing a seven-month downward trend.



Binance’s Market Position



April was particularly challenging for Binance, one of the leading crypto exchanges. Its spot trading volume dropped by 39.2% to $679 billion, and derivatives trading volume decreased by 27.7% to $2.03 trillion. These declines led to a reduction in Binance’s overall market share by 2.41% to 41.5%, marking its lowest spot market share since January 2024 at 33.8%. The downturn for Binance also aligns with legal challenges faced by its founder, Changpeng Zhao, who was recently sentenced to four months in prison for violations of U.S. money laundering laws. Since appointing a new CEO in November 2023, the exchange had initially seen a growth in market share, indicating that leadership changes have had a mixed impact.



CME’s Trading Volumes and Market Share



The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) also recorded declines in trading volumes across its cryptocurrency futures products. The total derivatives trading volume fell by 19.8% to $124 billion. 







Specifically, Bitcoin futures dropped by 17.7% to $101 billion, and Ethereum futures saw a more significant decline of 25.9% to $14.9 billion. Despite these reductions, CME’s market share in the derivatives sector marginally increased by 0.14% to 2.66%, benefiting from even steeper declines in other centralized exchanges.



The Broader Impact



The notable decrease in open interest on BTC instruments on CME, which fell by 35.3% to $7.59 billion, the lowest since February 27th, mirrors the retreat seen across the broader market. This decline in trading activity and open interest suggests that institutional traders are becoming more cautious, likely due to the cumulative effect of market uncertainties and regulatory concerns.

BitMEX Unites Forces with PowerTrade to Launch Deribit Challenger



BitMEX said its options trading platform will offer a full range of institutional-grade options for digital assets.

Renowned crypto derivative exchange BitMEX recently partnered with PowerTrade to introduce options trading to its platform. With this new addition, BitMEX aims to compete with Deribit to capture a substantial market share in this niche.
BitMEX Rivals Deribit
Stephan Lutz, CEO of BitMEX revealed in a recent statement that the firm aims to capture at least $500 million in trading volume within three months. Aligning with this move, the CEO said BitMEX will offer options trading in all regions where BitMEX is currently active.




“As a leading derivatives exchange, we want to empower BitMEX users with the optimal tools to maximize their potential and trading strategies, whether it’s hedging risks, positioning, or capitalizing on the recent surge in implied volatility,” Luz added.
Deribit has dominated the market since 2020. It accounts for 70% ($35.7 billion) of the $51.1 billion in trading volume for Bitcoin options in April. Besides BitMEX, other top crypto exchanges like Binance and OKX have also attempted to compete with Deribit for market share.
So far, these exchanges have had minimal success. While OKX generated about 16% of the last month’s trading volume valued at $8.4 billion, Binance recorded 9% ($4.8 billion).
BitMEX said its options trading platform will offer a full range of institutional-grade options for digital assets. The assets in view include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple’s XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana (SOL). In the future, the company plans to grow to incorporate more cryptocurrencies.
Mario Gomez Lozada, CEO of Power Traded commented on the partnership, stating, “The new BitMEX options platform merges PowerTrade’s trader-centric options solution with BitMEX’s deep liquidity and unparalleled reliability, empowering traders with seamless access to the most performant financial products.”
BitMEX Crypto Options Trading Strategy
The company’s initial approach focuses on offering customers free options trading for May. Additionally, there will be monthly trading competitions, incentives based on trading volume, and referral trading volume. As a result, a $20 onboarding bonus will be given to the first 1,000 new options traders.
BitMEX’s options fee structure would come after the zero-fee promotion period. Luz confirmed that the fee structure would replicate its current spot trading pricing. Luz added that the exchange will provide educational materials such as basic explainers. Additionally, it will offer strategy examples, and a step-by-step video tour, to users who are unfamiliar with options trading or the BitMEX platform.
Furthermore, BitMEX said it can also fight for market dominance by offering a user-friendly and robust options trading interface through an order book and Request-for-Quote (RFQ) with reduced counterparty risk.
Typically, RFQ allows traders to receive electronic quotations and execution for single-leg (e.g., purchasing a call) or multi-leg (e.g., buying a call and selling a put concurrently) options strategies with no minimum restrictions. With the grand plans, it remains to be seen whether BitMEX will succeed in grabbing a market share in the Options market from Deribit.

Intel: A Buying Opportunity Or A Lost Cause? - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Compared to its long-standing adversary AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) severely underperformed. Year-to-date, AMD stock gained 11.5%, while INTC shares lost 37.4%. Over one year, this divergence is even more pronounced, with AMD increasing by 63% while INTC is decreasing by 3%.



Although both semiconductor companies supply the market with CPUs and GPUs, Intel has a significant lead in the CPU market. Moving forward, does that mean that Intel’s fundamentals are sound, making this a buy-on-weakness opportunity, or is Intel stock heading for a further slump?



What is Intel’s Current Market Positioning?



According to the annual CPU shipments report for full-year 2023, prepared by Canalys, Intel holds a massive market lead of 78%, excluding tablets. Intel’s year-over-year shipments growth also surpassed AMD at 3% vs. -1%, with Apple shrinking by 4%. Mediatek tracked the largest growth spurt of 27% while Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) saw a 17% decline in shipments.



By PC vendors, Intel is more diversified, gaining revenue relatively evenly from Dell (NYSE: DELL) (26%), HP (NYSE: HPQ) (21%), and Lenovo (26%). AMD’s vendors are more concentrated, divided between Lenovo (40%) and HP (28%). Qualcomm, having had the highest shipments decline of 17%, is nearly entirely dependent on Acer (74%) and Dell (26%).



When it comes to the GPU market, everyone is behind Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Although Intel dominates the market at 67% share in Q4 2023, that is owing to the integrated graphics sector. Intel is a latecomer in the discrete GPU market arena, having launched Iris Xe Max in October 2020. Since then, until Q4 2022, Intel’s dGPU market share increased to an estimated 9% with its ARC lineup.





What is Intel’s Financial Status?



At the end of April, Intel delivered its Q1 2024 earnings report. After beating the prior three quarters’ estimates, the company suffered a negative (loss) earnings per share of $0.06 vs estimated -$0.03. 



Intel delivered a net loss of $381 million compared to the year-ago loss of $2.7 billion. Intel’s total assets remained relatively flat year-over-year, at $192.7 billion vs $191.5 billion in 2023. During that period, the company’s total liabilities slightly decreased, at $27.2 billion vs $28 billion in a year-ago quarter.



This puts Intel’s debt-to-equity ratio relatively low at 0.495, although AMD’s ratio is even lower at 0.044. After securing $8.5 billion from the US CHIPS Acti, alongside $11 billion in loans, Intel Foundry delivered an operating loss of $7 billion.



Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger expects these investments to generate profits between 2027 and 2030. If that materializes, and there is no shortage of qualified personnel, Intel could become one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies, sandwiched between TSMC and Samsung.



For Q2 ’24, Intel expects another earnings (loss) per share of $0.05 and revenue range of $12.5 – $13.5 billion from this quarter’s $12.7 billion. 







Intel’s Entanglement with Israel



Given the perennial Middle East volatility, it bears noting that Intel started heavily investing in Israel at the end of 2023, launching a $25 billion package. This led to Intel’s reliance on Israel’s multiple manufacturing and research and development facilities.



Additionally, there have been speculations that Intel implemented backdoors into Management Engine (ME) on CPUs. Purported undocumented x86 instructions also pushed the public perception in the negative direction.



Considering recent developments in the region, the international backlash may reflect badly on Intel as well among consumers.



Analyst Forecast for INTC Stock



Per Nasdaq’s aggregated data, INTC’s average price target is $39.92 vs the current $29.79, which is not far off from the 52-week low of $26.86 per share. The high estimate is $68, while the low forecast is $17. 



Overall, Intel’s heavy investments are taking a toll in the short to medium term. But considering the company’s domineering market weight for both GPU and CPU sectors, alongside USG’s blessing to revitalize the semiconductor industry, INTC stock is in a good position for long-term investors.

Avalanche Game ‘Shrapnel’ Now Lets Players Buy SHRAP With Credit/Debit Cards - Decrypt

Shrapnel, the anticipated first-person extraction shooter built around Avalanche blockchain assets, has launched a feature that enables players to purchase its SHRAP token using a credit or debit card, removing a potential barrier for mainstream gamers who haven’t previously handled cryptocurrency.Until now, players looking to buy the SHRAP token—which is used for purchasing in-game equipable cosmetics and future user-generated content trading—had to acquire it through an exchange, and thus already had to be familiar with transacting with cryptocurrency.This integration with crypto payments firm Halliday’s onramp enables direct in-game purchases of SHRAP via payments providers like MoonPay or Stripe."This is a huge milestone for us. Halliday removes a major Web3 point of friction, allowing players to use their credit card like any other free-to-play game," said Shrapnel CEO Mark Long, in a statement. "It will be easier than ever for our community to engage with Shrapnel's creator ecosystem—and truly own their assets and creations."Shrapnel has been in development for some time now, and in February launched its early access edition via the prominent Epic Games Store. Developer Neon Machine is gradually expanding the core experience with additional content and polish, all while incentivizing play by offering up hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of SHRAP to date.Shrapnel’s next big early access update will come on May 16-18 with the launch of the Shrapnel Training Exercises (STX3) version via the Epic Games Store.Editor’s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

What is BONK? Solana’s Dog-Themed Community Meme Coin - Decrypt

Born out of the wreckage left behind by the collapse of FTX in November 2022, BONK is a meme coin aimed at bringing together the Solana community.In December 2023, a BONK boom saw the cryptocurrency's market cap surge to over $1 billion, causing Solana Saga smartphones to sell out after savvy traders realized that the BONK airdrop bundled with the phones was worth more than the devices themselves.But what exactly is this dog coin all about? What makes it special? How does it work? And what even is the BONK meme?What is BONK?Billed as the "social layer and community meme coin" of Solana, BONK is a Solana-based cryptocurrency with an ecosystem encompassing DEXs, dapps, NFTs, and—of course—a dog mascot.As of May 2024, Bonk is the sixth largest meme coin, and is the 63rd largest cryptocurrency of any type by market capitalization, according to data from CoinGecko.Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried had been a vocal supporter of Solana, so when his fraud began to unravel in 2022, the Solana community was looking for a way to distance itself from the collapse of FTX.With sentiment around Solana's price "at an all-time low," 22 Solana developers joined forces to create a “community coin” with a useful (and dog-themed) ecosystem surrounding it.While the BONK core team remains anonymous, they claim to have prior experience building DeFi, NFT, and other products on Solana. They also explained that there isn’t a leader within the group, instead working together as equals.Shortly after the token launched in December 2022, Solana developers and community members were airdropped around $300 worth of BONK for Christmas. This was done in an attempt to unite and reward the community for pushing through the hard year. According to CoinGecko, as of May 2024 this airdrop is worth over $550,000.In January 2023, BONK's developers burned 5 trillion BONK that was allocated to them, in a bid to stop the cryptocurrency's value from dropping. This burn shrunk BONK's circulating supply by 5% to 94.2 trillion, but its value continued to fall in the immediate aftermath of the burn.What is the BONK ecosystem?According to its official website, BONK has 129 integrations, but lists seven key projects in its ecosystem.They include BONKbot, a Telegram trading bot that allows Solana users to trade using the messaging service, and BONKSwap, an automatic market maker (AMM).Other projects in the BONK ecosystem include a gamified fitness platform (Moonwalk), a cross-chain bridge to buy BONK (imaginatively called BuyBONK), and a decentralized exchange (OpenBONK).There are many other BONK-inspired Solana integrations spanning DeFi, gaming, and social, but we don’t have enough ink to go through all of them one-by-one.It is, however, important to highlight BONK’s continuous engagement with Solana NFT projects. For starters, the project distributed 21% of its token supply to 40 active Solana NFT projects. On top of this, a BONK-inspired NFT collection called BONKz was released in 2023.What's in a name?BONK's name references a series of comic memes, in which dogs—mostly the meme-friendly Shiba Inu breed—were hit on the head with hammers with a ‘bonk’ sound effect (obviously, no dogs were harmed in the making of the meme).According to KnowYourMeme, the 'bonk' meme originates from a 2019 Instagram post which features a “humorously malformed” Shiba Inu being struck by a hand holding a hammer, with a ‘bonk’ clip art and sound.This soon spread across Twitter and Reddit with other dogs getting bonked too. This meme later evolved into the ‘go to horny jail’ reaction meme, sent to users that were—as the cool kids say—being horny on main.Unlike many meme coins, the BONK token uses its own proprietary logo instead of the original meme. That's helped it to avoid the legal battles over copyright that have affected some projects, like BONK's Solana meme coin stablemate Shark Cat.What are the future plans for BONK?Since its initial Christmas Day airdrop in 2022, BONK has been all about bolstering the Solana community. Its distribution strategy going forward is no different.The BONKDAO decentralized autonomous organization has been assigned 15.8% of the total supply of BONK, in a bid to empower the community to choose where the BONK ecosystem goes next. The DAO has voted on proposals including the creation of a voting tutorial video, funding a marketing campaign, and burning treasury tokens.On top of this, any contributor who is given BONK tokens to fund their project is given a three year long vesting schedule. This means, in theory, that integrations are less likely to rug the funding as they are incentivized to stick around for at least three years.The best place to keep up with BONK community announcements is the BONK Inu Twitter account or the official Discord community.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Restaking Is Hot in Ethereum (ETH) and Entering Solana (SOL). Should We Worry?

With restaking, that locked-up ETH is kinda sorta freed up via the creation of a derivative, and the owner of that ETH can earn a bit more money. (So, too, can the restaking platform like EigenLayer that enables this.)

Mastercard, Citi, JPMorgan, Visa Explore Distributed Ledger Tech


In a push to harness cutting-edge technology, Mastercard, Visa, JPMorgan, and Citigroup are setting the stage for what could be a revolution in financial markets with distributed ledger solutions. 
The financial giants have united to launch the Regulated Settlement Network (RSN). 
Distributed Ledger Technology for Multi-Asset Settlements
The RSN plans to integrate commercial bank money with wholesale central bank funds and various securities, including US Treasuries and investment-grade debt. By facilitating settlements in US dollars, the project tests the feasibility of a more interconnected financial ecosystem with distributed ledger technology.
Interestingly, the New York Innovation Center of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has endorsed this initiative.

The RSN’s collaborative framework extends beyond a simple partnership. It is a robust effort that includes key players like Swift, Deloitte, and prominent US banks such as Wells Fargo and TD Bank. Each participant contributes unique expertise, advancing the adoption of distributed ledger technology across the US financial system.
A previous 12-week trial focused on domestic interbank and cross-border payments. This new phase builds on that foundation, engaging more financial institutions and advisory bodies like the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) to ensure a thorough approach to deploying this technology.
Raj Dhamodharan, Executive Vice President for Blockchain and Digital Assets at Mastercard, highlighted the potential impact,


“The application of shared ledger technology to dollar settlements could unlock the next generation of market infrastructures.” Dhamodharan said.

The RSN initiative aims to simplify the settlement process by merging various forms of money and securities onto a single platform. This reduces the risk of errors and fraud and strengthens the financial infrastructure against operational inefficiencies.

‘Smart Money’ Whales Accumulating Two AI Altcoins From Binance, According to On-Chain Analysts - The Daily Hodl


								Deep-pocketed investors are scooping up massive amounts of two artificial intelligence (AI)-related altcoins, on-chain data suggests.
Blockchain-monitoring service Lookonchain noticed that a Binance wallet linked to crypto investment firm DWF Labs suddenly received a large amount of Fetch.ai (FET), a decentralized machine learning project.










“Wallet ‘0x633c’ transferred 1 million FET ($2.25 million) to DWF Labs Binance deposit wallet again [on May 8th]. 
Wallet ‘0x633c’ received 5 million FET ($11.95 million) from Fetch.ai Foundation yesterday and deposited 2 million FET ($4.71 million) to DWF Labs Binance deposit wallet [on May 8th].”
Fetch.ai is trading for $2.20 at time of writing, down nearly 11% in the last 24 hours.
Next up, Lookonchain noticed multiple whales accumulating large amounts of Render (RNDR), a project related to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).
“The price of RNDR has increased by 40% in the past week! Let’s check if any whales and smart money are accumulating RNDR! 
0x15CF withdrew 748,898 RNDR ($5.3 million) from Binance on April 30th and May 1st, with a current floating profit of $2.24 million. He had traded RNDR seven times before, six of which were profitable, with a win rate of 85.7% and a total profit of $3.5 million! 
0x1Cb7 made $480,000 on RNDR before. He has withdrawn a total of 364,586 RNDR ($3.68 million) from exchanges in the past five days, with an average buying price of $9.19.

Argentina Takes Huge Bitcoin Step, After Elon Musk Recommended Investing in The Country - Bitcoin Sistemi


Genesis Digital Assets Limited (GDA), one of the world's largest Bitcoin mining companies, is expanding its operations in Argentina. The company announced a major agreement with YPF Luz, a subsidiary of Argentina's largest electricity company YPF, to open a new Bitcoin mining facility that will now operate using natural gas.
The operation will be carried out at the Bajo del Toro Thermal Power Plant operated by YPF Luz. It will power 1,200 Bitcoin mining machines to make money from waste gas that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere.


For the first time, the company opened a mining operation in Latin America, specifically in Rincón de Los Sauces in Neuquén Province, with a total capacity of 7 MW and a reserve of 1 MW.

“Although we have been considering expanding to Argentina for years, the political and pro-innovation climate that the country fosters for cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin in particular, has never been as strong as it is today,” GDA CEO Abdumalik Mirakhmedov said and added:






“There is also a large percentage of the population in Argentina that already uses cryptocurrencies and stablecoins to hedge against high inflation. Ultimately, crypto is a solution to these problems, and we are seeing this fact recognized by countries in Central and South America.”

Argentina's Bitcoin and crypto industry has been bustling since Javier Milei came to power in late 2023. As the public sector seeks to regulate activity to further align with Financial Action Task Force recommendations and International Monetary Fund requirements, companies, startups and users are looking for ways to sustain increased adoption.

Lawyer Predicts Ripple Win in SEC Case: Good News Looming? - DailyCoin


        
The landmark Ripple vs. SEC case has reached its closing stages, with final arguments having been submitted.



The crypto industry is on edge as the verdict will define regulations for digital assets in the US.



A prominent lawyer has predicted a victory for Ripple due to the SEC’s weak arguments and absence of new evidence.
The landmark legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC is nearing its conclusion. Both parties have submitted their closing arguments, leaving the cryptocurrency industry on tenterhooks as they await a verdict that could significantly impact how digital assets are regulated in the US.Ripple Eyes Victory as Final Arguments ConcludeProminent lawyer Jeremy Hogan, who has closely followed the case, believes Ripple has a strong chance of winning. In its final arguments, the SEC did not directly challenge Ripple’s core business model of facilitating international payments via blockchain technology. Additionally, they failed to present new evidence justifying their initial request for a hefty $2 billion fine against Ripple. Hogan interprets this as a sign of a potentially weaker case for the SEC. Furthermore, he believes the court is unlikely to rule that XRP is a security, a classification that would subject it to stricter regulations.This optimistic outlook for Ripple stands in stark contrast to the concerns of some industry leaders like Michael Saylor, who fear the SEC might restrict XRP and similar currencies. Saylor’s apprehension highlights the broader uncertainty surrounding the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation.The contrasting penalty amounts proposed by each side raise further questions about the SEC’s true intentions. The SEC seeks Ripple’s hefty $2 billion fine for selling XRP to institutional investors. Ripple counters with a significantly smaller figure of $10 million. Lawyer Jeremy Hogan warns that if the SEC prevails and forces Ripple to pay the $2 billion fine, Ripple might be forced to sell a large portion of its XRP holdings to meet the financial obligation. This, in turn, could lead to a significant drop in the price of XRP, potentially harming many retail investors who hold the cryptocurrency. A Decision with Far-Reaching ImplicationsHogan’s concerns underscore the potential negative consequences the SEC’s actions could have on the entire cryptocurrency market. The final decision in the Ripple vs SEC case will have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency industry in the US. A victory for Ripple could provide much-needed clarity for crypto companies by establishing clearer regulatory guidelines. 
Conversely, a win for the SEC could usher in an era of stricter regulations for cryptocurrency. With so much at stake, the entire crypto community is watching this case closely, as its outcome could set a precedent for future cryptocurrency regulation in the US.On the Flipside
Regardless of the verdict, the losing party will likely appeal the decision. This could prolong the uncertainty surrounding XRP and cryptocurrency regulations in the US.



The US verdict is just one piece of the puzzle. Regulations around cryptocurrency vary worldwide, and the Ripple vs. SEC case might not have a major international impact.
Why This MattersWith closing arguments submitted, the Ripple vs. SEC case nears its conclusion. This verdict will not only define XRP’s fate but also cast a long shadow over the entire US crypto market. A clear decision will provide long-awaited regulatory clarity, while an ambiguous one could leave the industry in limbo, impacting innovation and investor confidence.Dive deeper into the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs regarding an SEC accountant’s testimony as expert testimony here:SEC Repels Ripple’s Challenge in Contested Witness DisputeLearn more about the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC concerning XRP being a security here:Ripple Disputes SEC Last-Minute Witness as Judge Gets Strict

How a decentralized AI movement is shaping a fairer future

The world of artificial intelligence (AI) has become crowded by a small group of Big Tech companies vying for the largest cut of the market. This could lead to an elite few gatekeeping arguably the world’s most powerful technology.However, two companies are looking to shift the direction of the AI space toward decentralization using Web3 technologies.The Morpheus Network, an open-source network building decentralized AI smart agents, announced its official launch on May 8, with over $350 million in total locked value (TVL), along with its collaboration with 6079 — an emerging player in the independent AI movement. Morpheus was developed by a collective of more than 200 open-source contributors and has already had over 5,000 users staking Ether (ETH) to its capital contract. According to the project, its model aims to foster a more equitable funding environment for projects within the decentralized AI space.In tandem with Morpheus’s launch, 6079 unveiled its proof-of-inference protocol (PoIP) standard, designed to democratize access to AI services and promote trustless AI operations. Already, the project claims to have created millions of impressions and over 50,000 sign-ups for its "Free Think" initiative.Morpheus contributor David Johnston, said he is eager to see PoIP launch in a “fair manner” and that it was developed by the entire community. “Proof of Inference has a crucial part to play in the development of private, permissionless AI.”Related: The future of Web3 rewards: The role of AI in better airdrop campaigns6079 says it is on track to release its PoIP later this year. The protocol will operate as a verification layer between GPU networks and AI applications such as large-language model chatbots, similar to how a captcha system works for websites. The platform’s lead contributor, Mike Anderson, emphasized the need for decentralized control in the development of AI technologies, cautioning against the consolidation of power among a few dominant entities. Anderson told Cointelegraph that this marks a "pivotal moment" for the emergence of an AI-focused protocol that is truly by the people, for the people. This collaboration is not just about technology; it’s about transforming the ethos of AI development into a permissionless, transparent, and participatory process. Our goal is to ignite a global movement where every individual has the power to contribute, innovate, and influence the future of AI.His co-contributor Jesse Bryan echoed this sentiment emphasizing the importance of democratizing access to AI technology to ensure a more equitable digital future. “The choices we make today will shape the world of tomorrow. With the 6079 movement, we are not just advocating for change; we are driving it.”According to 6079, it stands for an AI future that “respects the dignity and agency of every individual, upholds the unhindered pursuit of knowledge and ideas and creates a world where the human mind flourishes without constraint.”The decentralized AI movement has been gaining momentum in the Web3 space, as developers begin to understand that decentralization could be the key to more unbiased AI algorithms.VIDEOAI vs. crypto: Will it make a real difference?

Crypto Investment Boom: Over $1 Billion Poured In For Two Straight Months


								The crypto sector continues to exhibit strong growth and resilience, as evidenced by the consistent influx of venture capital (VC), surpassing the $1 billion mark for the second consecutive month.
This sustained flow of investment highlights the market’s ongoing expansion and the increasing confidence of investors in the potential of blockchain technologies and digital assets.

Investment Trends and Sector Highlights in April’s Crypto Funding
In April alone, the crypto sector saw $1.02 billion raised across 161 investment rounds, closely following the $1.09 billion from 186 deals in March. These figures maintain momentum since the latter part of 2022, suggesting a stable and growing interest in the crypto space.
Crypto Fundraising Trend. | Source: Root Data
Significant contributions to this total include notable investments in various blockchain-related ventures. For instance, Securitize, a platform specializing in tokenizing real-world assets, secured a $47 million investment led by BlackRock.
Meanwhile, Monad, often called the “Solana killer,” attracted a substantial $225 million from Paradigm and Coinbase Ventures.
Other significant fundraises include Auradine and Berachain, which received $80 million and $100 million, respectively. These raises demonstrate the wide array of sectors within the crypto market, drawing investor interest.
Notably, investment trends within the digital currency market show a clear preference for certain sectors. Blockchain infrastructure firms have emerged as the top recipients of VC funding, amassing $1.7 billion in 2024.
This sector’s attractiveness is likely due to its foundational role in supporting the broader digital currency ecosystem’s functionality and scalability.
Following closely are decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which have garnered $626 million, underscoring their pivotal role in reshaping financial services through blockchain technology. Additionally, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) received a relatively modest $3 million.
Major VC Firms Next Move
According to the report, leading venture capital firms Pantera Capital and Paradigm are vigorously seeking substantial funds for fresh digital currency ventures.
Pantera Capital aims to secure $1 billion, potentially setting a record for the largest crypto fund raised since May 2022.
In contrast, having gathered $7.2 billion for multiple technology sectors, Andreessen Horowitz has decided against increasing investments in its dedicated cryptocurrency fund, demonstrating a selective strategy in its financial commitments to the digital asset landscape.

Speaking of major VC firms, Vance Spencer, co-founder of Framework Ventures, recently shared his perspective on the cryptocurrency market. Despite maintaining a bullish outlook on crypto, Spencer anticipates a turbulent two years ahead. The co-founder of Framework Ventures advised:
You should be prepared for at least 24 months of roller coaster crypto as we cut rates from 5.5% back to 2-3%.

Proposed US Blockchain Integrity Act would ban crypto mixers for 2 years

A bill has been introduced in the United States House of Representatives to ban cryptocurrency mixers for two years. Called the Blockchain Integrity Act, it is sponsored by five Democratic congressmen led by Sean Casten. Casten defined a crypto mixer in a statement as a pool that allows users to  “generate a new address and withdraw their funds without revealing the link between the depositor and withdrawal addresses.” The Blockchain Integrity Bill. Source: casten.house.govThe bill would temporarily prohibit financial institutions, including cryptocurrency exchanges, virtual asset service providers and any other registered money service businesses, from accepting funds that had gone through a mixer or to allow funds to be withdrawn directly to the address of a mixer. Every violation would be subject to a civil penalty of up to $100,000.Source: L0la L33tzDuring the two-year interval, the Treasury Department would compile a report detailing a wide range of information. The report would include an estimated percentage of transactions with mixers that involve illicit finance, legitimate uses of mixers, the capacity of law enforcement to track or prevent transactions and regulatory approaches to mixers taken in other jurisdictions. Related: Coinbase, Paradigm, others argue crypto mixer rules are a ‘waste of time’Reps. Bill Foster, Brad Sherman, and Emanuel Cleaver are cosponsors of the bill, which has yet to go to committee. Sherman, who has a long record as a crypto opponent was quoted by Casten as saying:“Cryptocurrency’s intention is right there in its name, a form of ‘hidden money.’ […] Terrorist groups, sanction evaders, tax evaders, cyber criminals, etc. all use mixers to obscure their illicit activity.”The United States has taken action against crypto mixers before. The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control placed addresses associated with mixer Tornado Cash on its list of Specially Designated Nationals in August 2022, effectively barring U.S. citizens from using it. That move survived a court challenge a year later. The founders of that mixer have been charged with money laundering, sanctions violations and related crimes in the United States and the Netherlands.Crypto mixer Monero has also been under pressure after the European Union introduced new Anti-Money Laundering laws.Magazine: Tornado Cash 2.0: The race to build safe and legal coin mixers

Bitcoin price to ‘sustain’ $265K level once boring consolidation ends - Analysts

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price could continue its uptrend and triple its market capitalization, propelling its price above $260,000, according to founder and CEO of on-chain and market analytics firm CryptoQuant Ki Young Ju.“Bitcoin network fundamentals could support a market cap three times its current size compared to the last cyclical top,” Young Ju explained in a May 8 post on X.Young Ju was referring to a chart comparing BTC’s price and the associated hash rate to market capitalization ratio, highlighting the crypto’s ongoing volatility and the resilience of the Bitcoin network. The chart reveals that Bitcoin’s hash rate to market cap ratio has increased significantly in 2024, which suggests a possible increase in market activity and investor interest. The hash rate to market cap ratio assesses the growth of mining activity relative to the market capitalization. If this ratio continues to grow, Young Ju declared it could “potentially sustain” Bitcoin’s price to $265,000. Bitcoin: hash rate vs. market cap ratio. Source: CryptoQuantIn response, analyst and trader Crypto Ceaser pointed out that Young Ju’s views aligned with their analysis, which showed that BTC had formed a large cup-and-handle pattern on the weekly chart. The setup forms when an asset in a bullish trend retraces twice, first in a wide, shallow move forming the cup and then in a smaller dip forming the handle. The cup-and-handle pattern is a bullish continuation pattern that usually forms during a price consolidation period. If confirmed, the chart projected a BTC rally toward the technical target of the governing chart pattern at $273,693. “Whilst this target is particularly high, it is a legitimate target and technically a diminished return (measured from low to high).”BTC/USD weekly chart. Source: Crypto CaesarCrypto Caesar explained that BTC’s price is currently in a “critical area,” consolidating below its all-time highs.He added:“If Bitcoin can start to trend above ATH’s this summer, then I anticipate a strong rally to the upside and potentially a shorter cycle.”Although it is crucial that Bitcoin holds above its short-term holder price of $59,500 to “maintain its bullish trend,” crypto analyst and co-founder of CMCC Crest Willy Woo told his 1.1 million X followers on May 3.Glassnode analysts said in a May 7 report that the average short-term holder acquisition price has always acted as a stiff barrier during bearish trends and provided strong support during bullish trends. “This thesis has held up so far this week, with the Bitcoin market correcting down below the STH-Cost Basis at $59.8k, where it found support and rallied higher.”Bitcoin STH realized price and MVRV. Source: GlassnodeMeanwhile, some traders believe that Bitcoin has to produce a decisive daily candlestick close above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) to remain bullish. Crypto influencer Lark Davis shared this sentiment, saying, “We want to now have a breakout and produce a strong daily candle close above the 50-day SMA on the chart here.”Related: BTC price clings to $62K as Bitcoin bulls suffer post-halving ‘boredom’“BTC is currently in the process of breaking the trendline of Pennant and the 50 Daily SMA,” added Negentropic, an X account authored by the co-founders of Glassnode.“When level 65-66K is broken, BTC will move on first to 73.5K and then 76.5K and chances are that we will see 85.2K before the summer.”BTC/USD daily chart. Source: NegentropicBitcoin’s volatility is cooling off slightly as “price has been consolidating in this current range,” crypto trader Daan Crypto Traders told his X followers in a May 8 post, adding, “It’s still at relatively low levels compared to last cycle.

Bitcoin hovers above $62K - Has the market survived the bear trap?

Bitcoin experienced a decline towards $62,000 during the Asian and European sessions on Wednesday, joining the broader dip in the crypto market where tokens gave up some of their gains from the recent rally.Currently, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) stands at $62,046.00, showing a slight decrease of 0.5% in the past hour and a 2.7% decline since yesterday. The current value of BTC is 8.0% higher than its value a week ago.The current global crypto market cap stands at $2.4 Trillion, with a decrease of 3.16% in the past 24 hours and an impressive 102.43% increase compared to one year ago. Currently, the market capitalization of Bitcoin stands at $1.22 Trillion, indicating a Bitcoin dominance of 50.86%. Meanwhile, Stablecoins’ market cap stands at $161 billion, accounting for 6.68% of the overall crypto market cap.Bitcoin stabilizes above $62K ahead of the weekendBitcoin prices have been trading within a narrow range since surpassing the significant $60,000 mark on May 3. Other cryptocurrencies have also experienced a decline. Solana has experienced significant losses among the top altcoins, dropping 6.5% to $146, while ether has seen a decline of approximately 3.63% and is currently trading around $3,000.Throughout the ongoing cycle, BTC and ETH have experienced a noticeable divergence in their individual performances.Glassnode’s findings suggest that there is a noticeable trend of weaker capital rotation, especially when compared to previous cycles and all-time high breakthroughs.Prior to bitcoin reaching its peak on March 14, Glassnode noticed a significant increase in speculative activity. According to its most recent on-chain weekly report, there has been a significant increase in capital accumulation among BTC holders in the short term. Approximately $240 billion worth of coins have been moved within the last six months, approaching peak levels of wealth held.Ethereum, on the other hand, has not been able to achieve the same level of success. The top altcoin has yet to surpass its all-time high level from 2021. Bitcoin’s Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Cap is currently approaching the level seen during the peak of the previous bull run. In contrast, Ethereum’s STH-Realized Cap has only experienced a minimal increase from its lows, suggesting a relatively unimpressive influx of fresh capital.The lack of new capital inflows is a result of ETH’s underperformance in comparison to BTC. One possible reason for this could be the increased attention and ease of access provided by spot Bitcoin ETFs.The market eagerly awaits the SEC’s decision on the approval of a suite of Ethereum ETFs, which is anticipated to be announced by the end of May.How low can the crypto market sink?Although ETH may have lagged behind BTC in terms of performance, Glassnode’s analysis indicates that the overall upward trend appears to be exceptionally strong, with relatively minor corrections thus far.Currently, the value of Ethereum (ETH) stands at $3,000.09. This represents a slight decrease of 0.6% compared to an hour ago, and a 2.3% decline since yesterday. The current value of ETH has increased by 3.3% in the past week.Glassnode observes that “When we break down capital flows and rotation between BTC and ETH, we can see that Bitcoin has received the lions share of inflows, likely driven in part by the US spot ETFs. Short-Term Holders and speculation activity appears concentrated within Bitcoin, with a remarkably weak spill-over into Ethereum thus far.”

The Protocol: From 'Node Sales' to 'Address Poisoning,' the Money's in Crypto

NODES FOR SALE: It's the blockchain industry's latest innovation – not in technology, but in how to round up cash from investors. "Node sales" involve selling blockchain nodes directly to investors – a process that brings in quick cash while ostensibly giving projects an easy path to decentralization. Still a relatively new phenomenon in fast-moving crypto, they are becoming more common: Aethir, a decentralized GPU cloud infrastructure provider, disclosed last week that it had distributed more than 73,000 node licenses valued at over 41,000 ETH ($126 million). Other blockchain projects raising funds via node sales include CARV, XAI Games and Powerloom. The latest to come to market is Sophon, an entertainment-focused blockchain ecosystem based on zkSync technology, relying on Celestia for data. The project attracted more than $60 million in a node sale over the past week, even though its founders are semi-anonymous. Certain mechanics of the sales appear designed to drive the fear of missing out, or FOMO – such as a system of tiering, where the price goes higher as more nodes are sold, and the use of exclusive whitelists that reserve early spots for certain users. "Buyers hope to get high quality projects," says Calvin Chu, a former Binance researcher who helped start Impossible Finance, which has facilitated some of the sales. As with many crypto-related investments, buyers also hope for juicy yields in the forms of token rewards, and possibly to qualify for eventual token airdrops.

JPMorgan, Citi, Mastercard, Visa join forces to test tokenized asset settlement on shared ledger - Crypto Briefing




A group of leading financial institutions, including JPMorgan, Citi, Mastercard, Visa, Swift, TD Bank N.A., US Bank, USDF, Wells Fargo, and Zions Bancorp, have initiated a proof-of-concept (PoC) for a Regulated Settlement Network (RSN). The project will explore the use of shared ledger technology for the settlement of tokenized assets, according to a press release published on Wednesday.Debopama Sen, Global Head of Payments at Citi Services, said the project could create a more general system for electronically settling all sorts of financial transactions while still following existing regulations.“Citi looks forward to exploring the opportunities of this project, which brings together assets that currently live in separate silos into a 24/7, programmable, multi-asset settlement environment – and aims to do that in a collaborative manner across public and private sectors,” Sen noted.Currently, settling financial transactions involves separate systems for different types of assets. This can be slow and inefficient. The RSN PoC is exploring a new way to handle these transactions. Its goal is to see if creating a 24/7 system that facilitates interoperable multi-asset transactions on a single, secure platform is feasible.Raj Dhamodharan, Executive Vice President, Blockchain & Digital Assets at Mastercard, highlighted the need for collaboration between the public and private sectors to explore how blockchain technology can address real-world issues and improve efficiency.“The application of shared ledger technology to dollar settlements could unlock the next generation of market infrastructures – where programmable settlements are 24/7 and frictionless,” Dhamodharan said.“It is great to collaborate with our industry partners and the public sector on the US Regulated Settlement Network. RSN presents an opportunity to explore the impact of innovations in shared ledger technology on settlement, an area often constrained by siloed infrastructures and processes,” Amanda CR Morgan, Senior Product Manager, Visa Money Movement, noted.Managed by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), this initial exploration will focus on simulating transactions in US dollars, aiming to demonstrate potential improvements in multi-asset settlement operations.Charles de Simone, Managing Director at SIFMA, said the project is an essential step in exploring how digital forms of money and securities can be used efficiently and securely in the financial markets.“This exploration of shared ledger technology is an important initiative to explore innovations working with digital forms of USD cash and securities, as market participants continue to innovate to support efficient, resilient capital markets,” he said.The PoC also includes a group of US-based project contributors and technical observers, such as the New York Innovation Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which will monitor the use of shared ledger technology for regulated financial institution transfers, as noted in the press release.After testing, the participants will share their findings to help shape the future of financial settlements. However, there is no commitment to continue research after this initial exploration.

DeFi lending protocol Nexo allocates $12M for ecosystem incentives

Crypto lending protocol Nexo is allocating 10 million NEXO tokens, worth $12.5 million at the time of publication, to its users. "Stack points, multiply your gains, and unlock more surprises," wrote Nexo developers on May 8 regarding the protocol's sixth anniversary. "The Nexonomics-inspired hunt is designed to reward new and existing users for exploring the Nexo ecosystem."From now until July 7, Nexo users can receive up to 0.01 points per $1 of asset top-ups, 10 points per Nexo Card activation, 0.04 points per $1 in fiat borrowed through Nexo protocol, 0.03 points per $1 invested in Nexo Earn products, and 0.05 points per $1 of boosted trading on Nexo Exchange. The point-to-NEXO-token conversion ratio will be determined at the end of the event. "Keep in mind that certain actions can reduce your points balance" developers also warned, writing: "For instance, withdrawing crypto assets from your Nexo account will result in a loss of 0.01 points for each $1 withdrawn. Withdrawing BTC will result in a loss of 0.001 points for each $1 withdrawn."Depending on their activity, users can also receive multipliers of 1.2x to 1.5x on points earned, and loyalty rewards up to 100% of the points value. Nexo staff illustrated the following example: "Suppose you haven't funded your account yet and want to buy $2,000 worth of BTC during the first week of the hunt. In this case, you will receive 450 points (2,000 purchase value x 0.03 points for each $1 purchased x 1.5 Weekly Multiplier x 5 New User Multiplier)."Due to regulatory restrictions, U.S., U.K., and Canadian citizens and residents are not eligible for the campaign. Since its launch six years ago, the popular decentralized finance lending platform has attracted $537.56 million in total value locked (TVL). On March 6, the platform received UAE regulator approval for its local entity Nexo Services FZE for virtual asset lending and borrowing. Related: Nexo seeks $3B in damages from Bulgaria over dropped investigation

When is full recovery not a full recovery? FTX


The FTX debtors in possession have announced a new reorganization plan that would result in nearly every single creditor getting recovery of their full claim amount plus additional interest, according to court documents. 
Additionally, the plan would resolve claims from the Internal Revenue Service and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and potentially allow for restitution from the Department of Justice fines to be paid to creditors. 
The press release issued by the debtors in possession highlights that most of this recovery has come from ‘proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX ventures businesses.’ It’s the sale of those assets that principally drove the recovery, as the press release highlights that FTX held ‘only 0.1% of the bitcoin and only 1.2% of the ethereum’ that it was meant to at bankruptcy. 
Some of these investments have included Alameda’s investment in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic as well as some other investments that have accrued in value.
However, some FTX creditors are less than satisfied with this resolution to the bankruptcy process, feeling entitled to more of the appreciation that their cryptocurrency assets might have benefited from had FTX not been forced to shut down and close withdrawals.

The initial claim amounts were fixed in dollars when FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022. At the time, crypto was far less valuable, with bitcoin worth less than $20,000.
This means that even with the additional interest the claimants will receive, it will still be substantially less than it might have been had financial criminal Sam Bankman-Fried not misappropriated billions of dollars from the exchange.

Maartunn, a contributor to the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, warned that for Bitcoin, any daily close below $62,100 “or prolonged inactivity counts as a stop-loss.”Meanwhile, Michael van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm MNTrading, expressed frustration at the lacklustre price action since Bitcoin's halving in mid-April. “Bitcoin slowly proceeds towards the lower boundaries of the range for a test of support,” he said. “After that, it seems likely we’ll continue the upward grind. Boredom has started since the Bitcoin halving took place.”Solana’s three-day winning streak appears to be over, with SOL dropping by more than 5%.Data from DefiLlama shows that Solana's TVL on Wednesday stood at 26.92 million SOL, marking the lowest point in the month, as compared to 28.22 million SOL the day before.

Bitcoin has come to a calm period - What does this mean for the crypto market?

Last week, Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of the BitMEX crypto exchange, expressed his belief that bitcoin (BTC) had reached its lowest point. However, he also mentioned that the anticipated upward movement is expected to be gradual.Now, an indicator known as the volatility risk premium (VRP) is indicating the same, signaling a market environment with relatively low volatility ahead. This could be viewed as a positive development by long-term investors.Bitcoin market performance after halvingCurrently, the value of BTC stands at $62,552.88. This represents a slight 0.5% increase compared to an hour ago, but a 1.4% decline since yesterday. The current value of BTC is 9.7% higher than its value a week ago.The current global crypto market cap stands at $2.42 Trillion, with a decrease of -2.28% in the past 24 hours and a significant increase of 103.59% compared to one year ago. Currently, BTC’s market cap stands at $1.23 Trillion, indicating a BTC dominance of 50.99%. Meanwhile, Stablecoins’ market cap stands at $161 billion, representing a 6.65% share of the overall crypto market cap.With that in mind, VRP captures the phenomenon where the expected price turbulence, as indicated by an asset’s option-induced implied volatility, tends to be higher than the actual realized volatility in the long run. The spread reflects the extra compensation that options sellers require due to the increased risks linked to uncertain future conditions and price fluctuations.According to data tracked by analysts at Bitfinex, the one-month VRP has significantly decreased from 15% to 2.5% since the implementation of mining reward halving on April 20 by the BTC blockchain. The calculation of VRP relies on the difference between Volmex’s BVIV and VBRV, which measures the implied and realized volatility of bitcoin over a 30-day period.Michaël van de Poppe, the founder and CEO of trading firm MNTrading, voiced his frustration regarding the absence of a clear direction in the market following Bitcoin’s block subsidy halving in mid-April.“Bitcoin is gradually moving towards the lower boundaries of the range to test the support,” he wrote on that day. The recent turbulence in the crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) sector has left observers with varying perspectives on the future.Post BTC halving crypto lifeThe Bitcoin halving on April 19 was highly anticipated by crypto investors. Historically, Bitcoin halvings have resulted in remarkable surges in the crypto market. Despite the recent decline in Bitcoin’s price, many anticipate that this halving cycle will follow the same pattern.In an event that takes every four years, the Bitcoin blockchain recently reduced the per block supply emission from 6.125 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This has effectively halved the rate at which the supply of Bitcoin is expanding.Experts believe that global debt worries and extensive fiscal spending in the U.S. will contribute to bitcoin’s potential for significant gains following the halving, similar to its previous record.Although the one-month VRP for ether (ETH) has decreased from 18% to 8.5%, it is still relatively high compared to bitcoin. This suggests that traders perceive the future of ether to be somewhat uncertain.The volatility risk premium (VRP) for both Bitcoin and Ethereum have now seen dramatic reductions. Bitcoin’s VRP collapsed to 2.5 percent from 15 percent, and Ethereum’s to 8.5 percent from 18 percent post the halving. Volatility risk premium (VRP) reflects the tendency for implied volatility to surpass realised volatility. This discrepancy between what is anticipated in terms of volatility (implied) and what actually transpires (realised) constitutes the risk premium. Essentially, VRP quantifies the premium that investors demand as compensation for the additional risks associated with the uncertain future volatility of asset returns.

2. Guide to Maximizing Rewards on Binance Megadrop
2.1 Understanding Binance Megadrop
The Binance Megadrop is an innovative token launch platform that integrates Binance Simple Earn and the Binance Web3 Wallet to offer users a more interactive and rewarding experience.
Its primary goal is to provide early access to promising Web3 projects before they are officially listed on Binance, thereby reinventing the traditional airdrop mechanism. This platform aims to combine user engagement with education and reward, positioning itself as a unique interactive experience within the cryptocurrency space.
Access and Participation
You can access the Megadrop by logging into your Binance account and navigating to the Megadrop section under the “More” menu. Here, you can view ongoing projects, select one to participate in, and start completing various tasks to earn rewards.

2.2 Earning Points and Rewards
Locking BNB
One of the primary methods to earn points is by locking BNB. Users can navigate to the ‘Lock BNB’ section within the Megadrop project page, select a subscription period, and lock their BNB.
Longer subscription periods generally yield higher scores, reflecting a greater commitment to the project.
Maximizing Your Rewards with Extended Lock Periods:
For participants looking to maximize their potential rewards, consider opting for the longest available subscription period.
Locking your BNB for 120 days is particularly advantageous, as it typically offers the highest score multipliers. This extended lock period not only reflects a strong commitment to the project but also significantly enhances your chances of earning substantial rewards.

Completing Web3 Quests
Another method to accrue points is by completing Web3 quests.
These quests might involve interacting with the project’s smart contracts or completing specific tasks within the Binance or project ecosystem. Detailed instructions and tutorials are provided for each quest to guide users through the process.

Points System and Score Calculation
The total score a user can accumulate is the sum of the points from locked BNB and completed quests.
Points from locked BNB are calculated based on the amount and duration of the lock, while points from quests may include bonuses for completing all available quests. The formula typically looks something like:
Total Score = (Locked BNB Score * Web3 Quest Multiplier) + Web3 Quest Bonus.
2.3 Strategic Participation Tips
To maximize rewards, users should consider locking their BNB as soon as the Megadrop starts, and for the longest duration feasible, as earlier and longer commitments often result in higher scores.
It’s also advantageous to complete all available Web3 quests to benefit from any multipliers or bonuses.
Timing is crucial in the Megadrop. Participating early in a project’s listing cycle and staying engaged until the end can significantly influence the total score, especially if the participation metrics are competitive.
Reward Distribution
Rewards are usually distributed after the Megadrop event concludes. The final score calculations are made at the end of the participation period, and rewards are then credited to users’ spot wallets on Binance.
It is vital to monitor the project page for updates on the distribution schedule and any potential changes based on project dynamics or Binance policies.
3. BounceBit in Binance Megadrop
3.1 Participation Details
BounceBit’s participation in the Binance Megadrop is a significant event marked by meticulously planned phases. The Megadrop period for BounceBit is scheduled from April 26, 2024, at 00:00 UTC to May 12, 2024, at 23:59 UTC.
During this period, users can lock their BNB and engage in various tasks to earn points and rewards. BounceBit will be officially listed on Binance on May 13, 2024, with trading pairs including BB/BTC, BB/USDT, among others. This listing is an important milestone as it facilitates broader accessibility and liquidity for the $BB token.
The initial circulating supply of $BB tokens at the time of listing will be 409,500,000, which constitutes 19.5% of the total token supply. The Megadrop itself allocates 168,000,000 $BB tokens, representing 8% of the maximum token supply, to be distributed among participants based on their total scores.
Web3 Quests and Rewards
Participation in Web3 quests is a crucial component of the Megadrop event for BounceBit. One example of such a quest is “Stake 0.0001 BTCB to BounceBit,” which will be available on May 13, 2024, starting at 06:00 UTC.
These quests are designed to familiarize users with BounceBit’s technology and encourage active engagement with the platform. Completing these quests not only contributes to users’ total Megadrop score but also offers a practical introduction to using BounceBit’s services.
BounceBit’s innovative approach to Bitcoin restaking and its integration with Binance’s Megadrop provides unique opportunities for users to engage with and benefit from the evolving digital asset ecosystem. Here are several calls to action that can help you maximize your involvement and benefit from these opportunities:

However, he emphasizes the significance of the next low, suggesting that if the price breaks down to the range low of $59,000 again, Bitcoin could experience a violent drop to $50,000.Meanwhile, DonAlt frames the current market situation as a battle between a downtrend and a range reclaim. While he is currently on “team range reclaim,” he notes that the immediate retest of the range low is not a positive sign.He warns that if Bitcoin starts losing the lows, "this will turn ugly fast," and advises traders to "be ready to parachute out if need be."Also Read: Are Bitcoin Whales Buying The Dip With Less Enthusiasm?Why It Matters: The insights shared by DonAlt and Altcoin Sherpa highlight the critical importance of key support levels in determining Bitcoin’s short-term price action.DonAlt’s warning about a potential drop to $50,000 if the $59,000 range low is breached serves as a reminder of the volatility inherent in the crypto market and the need for proper risk management.Similarly, Altcoin Sherpa’s advice to be prepared to exit positions quickly if the market turns against them underscores the importance of having a well-defined trading plan and the discipline to stick to it.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Despite Bitcoin Hitting $64K, Analyst Says King Crypto Remains In ‘Prime Buy Zone’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) to Explode 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Andrew Tate Coin (ANDTATE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token. 




ANDTATE will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Andrew Tate Coin.



Currently, Andrew Tate Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. 



To buy ANDTATE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Andrew Tate Coin by entering its contract address – Cp7qyqdzXAqF7fqKXzS8LwTE7JQvh2V3vYGnDdx6j4ii – in the receiving field.




ANDTATE currently has a market cap of just under $20,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. 



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

FTX outlines plan to repay creditors in full with interest


FTX Trading Ltd. proposed a reorganization plan to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware on Tuesday, aiming to fully repay its non-governmental creditors, including interest. 



The plan, pending court approval, is designed to address over US$14 billion in debts and offers up to 118% of claim value to the majority of creditors through asset liquidations and settlements. 



The reorganization strategy includes a fund pool estimated between US$14.5 and US$16.3 billion, derived from asset sales and settlements. This estimate includes assets under the control of the Chapter 11 debtors and the official joint liquidators, FTX said in a press release on Tuesday.



A special provision for smaller creditors with claims up to $50,000 could result in 98% of them receiving approximately 118% of their claim value within 60 days of the plan’s activation if approved by the Bankruptcy Court. 

	
	
	
	


The reorganization plan is a response to the company’s dramatic collapse in 2022, which led to the conviction and sentencing of former chief executive officer Sam Bankman-Fried for fraud. 



In March this year, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Renowned CEO Reveals The Altcoin He's Mega Bullish On, In Addition To Bitcoin And Ethereum - Bitcoin Sistemi


Viska Digital CEO Dadi Kristjansson recently shared his views on the current state of the cryptocurrency market in a conversation with Coinbase International.
Kristjansson stated that there is a bullish trend on Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) compared to the US dollar.


Kristjansson believes the market is currently underestimating Solana's potential. He expects to see an increase in investment flows into SOL, attracted by the flexibility, speed and cost-effectiveness of the Solana network.
The CEO also touched on Ethereum's inflation rate, which continues to be quite low. Viska Digital's research team believes the market has underpriced the likelihood of an eventual ETH ETF approval.






Following the recent surge in BTC prices, Viska Digital's trading desk sees $60,000 as an important support level for Bitcoin. They believe that Bitcoin could reach an all-time high if it rises decisively above $67,000.
In terms of investment flows, ETFs have returned to net inflows over the past few days following the Fed's dovish comments. Grayscale saw its first two daily entries since converting to an ETF, indicating that the rotation away from GBTC has cooled.

As Ripple-SEC legal battle picks up, XRP gets caught in the middle - AMBCrypto



SEC pushes for punishment against Ripple.
XRP has relapsed into a bear trend following attempts.

The ongoing dispute between Ripple [XRP] and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues. 
The latest filing from the SEC challenged some of Ripple’s positions and advocated for injunctions against the company. Amidst this legal battle, XRP has recently reverted to a bearish trend.
SEC fires shots in latest reply to Ripple
A recent filing revealed that the SEC has submitted its final reply to Ripple in the lawsuit’s remedies stage. In its response, the SEC challenged Ripple’s claim that it acted without recklessness. 
Also, it disputed its assertion that there should be no widespread uncertainty regarding the legal status of XRP, despite the court previously rejecting this “fair notice” defense. 
Previously, a ruling declared that XRP was not a security, dealing a blow to the SEC’s position. However, the SEC maintained its belief that the company would likely engage in similar actions in the future.
 Consequently, the SEC argued that its assurances about changing its behavior post-lawsuit do not warrant avoiding injunctions. 
The latest SEC filing indicates that the regulatory body is steadfast in its allegations against Ripple and is advocating for a ruling against the company. 
In response, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, criticized the SEC for allegedly disregarding the law. Despite this criticism, Alderoty expressed optimism that the case was nearing its conclusion.
Ripple drops below the neutral line
AMBCrypto’s analysis of XRP’s price revealed a nearly 3% decline on the 7th of May. The daily timeframe chart showed a 2.83% decrease, with XRP trading around $0.52. 
This decline influenced its trend, as evidenced by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Before the decline, Ripple had marginally crossed above the neutral line on the RSI following a 1.8% increase. 
Source: TradingView
However, at the time of writing, its price remained around $0.52, experiencing a minor decrease of less than 1%. Additionally, the RSI fell further below the neutral line, indicating a strengthening bearish trend.
Volume remains in the $1 billion threshold
At press time, Ripple’s trading volume has notably decreased.

Realistic or not, here’s XRP market cap in BTC’s terms

While it remained within the $1 billion range, the volume has dropped to around $1.17 billion from the over $1.8 billion recorded in the previous trading session. 
This decline in volume signals a reduction in trading activity, consistent with the recent trend observed for the asset over the past few weeks.

Solana Breakout: Crypto Analysts Confirm SOL Is Ready To Cross $200 | Bitcoinist.com


								Solana had previously touched $200 earlier in the year but this was only for a brief period before declining back down to $150. At this point, the Solana indicators are beginning to flash bullish, prompting crypto analysts to predict a resurgence above $200 for the altcoin.
Solana Shows Growth On D1 Timeframe
Crypto analyst Maximilian FX has predicted that the Solana price could be on its way to a resurgence. The analyst points to the ascending growth of SOL on the D1 timeframe as one of the reasons why the altcoin is set to recover.

Maximilian FX explains that the crypto market has also reversed from its bullish trend. This happened earlier in the week and the market began to recover once more, pushing the Bitcoin price above $63,000 for a brief period.
Taking the upward momentum of the market into account, the crypto analyst believes that the SOL price will recover above $200 again. However, it shows a retracement back down to $143, which has since been reached in the early hours of Wednesday.
From here, the analyst expects the SOL price to keep rising. “Based on the setup and current trend, the most likely target for a resistance breakout is D1 at 172.33. In this scenario, we are waiting for further growth towards the target of 200.00,” Maximilian FX stated.
SOL Establishes Support Above $125
Another crypto analyst, Orson Fawley, has predicted that the Solana price is getting ready to beat the $200 level once again. The analyst outlines that Solana has seen support develop at around $12,5.80, and this level continues to serve it well.
Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Moves 1.7 Trillion SHIB As Price Struggles, Where Are They Headed?
For now, the price is moving toward resistance at $157, which has now become the point to beat. Fawley explains that if the altcoin is able to successfully clear this level, then $180 is the next stop. “On the other hand, SOLUSDT might still retest the support once more before the upward trend is firmly established,” the crypto analyst said.
Currently, the Solana price is trending at $146, with a 6.39% loss in the last 24 hours. However, on the 7-day chart, the altcoin is performing much better, with a 20.23% gain.

'Ghosts or AI?': How AI Has Supercharged the Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar Rap Beef - Decrypt

There’s a lot going on in the ongoing beef between rappers Drake and Kendrick Lamar—to put it mildly—much of which we're not going to get into here. But there’s one emerging theme from the scorched earth lyrical battle that’s SFW: the ways in which it’s revealed the increasingly central role of AI in modern music. In the thick of Drake and Lamar’s relentless exchange of brutal diss tracks this weekend, a key Kendrick ally—record producer Metro Boomin—posted an anti-Drake beat on Twitter, and encouraged his followers to rap over it for a prize.The track, “BBL Drizzy,” references a derogatory nickname for the Toronto-born pop star first coined by fellow rapper Rick Ross. Like so many viral tracks circulating these days, “BBL Drizzy” is an AI-generated beat that transforms modern references into vintage sounds (see: a fake Frank Sinatra Radiohead cover, or a 1940’s big band tune about a man losing control of bodily functions at work). In this case, Metro Boomin repurposed an unending string of Drake insults as a 1970s soul ballad. A version of the track was first created last month by King Willonius, a comedian who utilizes AI to generate cultural commentary. AI found its way into the heart of Drake and Lamar’s dispute long before this weekend, though. In March, one of Drake’s first direct shots at Lamar—a track titled “Taylor Made Freestyle”—included AI-generated vocals imitating both Snoop Dogg and the late rap legend Tupac Shakur. Within days, Shakur’s estate threatened to sue Drake, lambasting the unauthorized use of the deceased rapper’s likeness—particularly to mock Lamar, another prominent West Coast hip-hop star who has long idolized Shakur.“The unauthorized, equally dismaying use of Tupac’s voice against Kendrick Lamar, a good friend to the Estate who has given nothing but respect to Tupac and his legacy publicly and privately, compounds the insult,” a cease-and-desist letter obtained by Billboard read.Two days later, Drake removed the track from social media. Within a week, Lamar released “Euphoria,” a blistering anti-Drake diatribe that specifically called out the artist’s reliance on artificial intelligence to fight lyrical battles. “Am I battlin’ ghosts or AI?” Lamar rapped, after claiming that Drake is incapable of writing songs without 20-person teams and high-tech assistance.Ironically, Drake has also been on the receiving end of AI-driven drama. Last year, a AI-powered song imitating both his voice and that of fellow musician The Weeknd attracted so much positive attention that it was almost considered for a Grammy—before legal threats from Universal Music Group put that prospect to bed. In spite of its artificially enhanced origins, the track “Heart On My Sleeve” was so widely acclaimed that some hip-hop fans argued it was better than the real thing.“Best Drake song in years and he didn’t even write or sing in it,” one YouTube commenter wrote.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin podcaster secretly records Coinbase scammer’s confession


A cohort of lawless US-based youngsters are making millions of dollars by stealing crypto assets over the phone. In a revealing undercover recording, a telemarketing scammer confessed to his scheme to a famous Bitcoin podcaster. 
Junseth, the co-creator of one of the earliest Bitcoin podcasts, has published his half-hour conversation with the thief as a standalone episode. The thief didn’t give Junseth permission to record or publish the conversation, in which he admits to committing multiple federal crimes.
During the reverse interview, which started as an unsolicited phone call from someone pretending to be Coinbase customer support, a scammer claiming to be a high school student tries to convince Junseth of a supposedly imminent security threat.
He quickly walks Junseth through a series of seemingly innocuous steps to ‘protect’ his Coinbase account. Of course, these steps are cleverly devised to grant the thief access to Junseth’s Coinbase and/or Google accounts.
Junseth played along as the caller attempted to ‘help’ him regain access to his account, including an attempt to login to Junseth’s Gmail. When called out, the thief eventually admitted to the ruse and relaxed into a revealing conversation.

How thieves steal crypto over the phone
For nearly 30 minutes, the young scammer detailed his operations, from using Google Forums to impersonate Google employees, owning the username ‘Coinbase’ within the video game Minecraft, paying robodialers to pre-qualify leads, and purchasing leads from dark net vendors.
While he initially claimed to be working alone during off-school hours and summer break, later details of the conversation seem to indicate that his group of co-conspirators is considerably larger.
As it turns out, the man is part of an organized group of youngsters that conduct sophisticated social engineering attacks on wealthy Americans. Although there are reasons to be skeptical of his claims, he says he profits tens of thousands of dollars a month by stealing crypto assets from victims’ hardware wallets and exchange accounts.
The thief also claimed to own an expensive McLaren and to have spent over $100,000 during one nightclub outing. Even Junseth admitted, “some of his facts are false.”
The man also claimed to have hacked a customer of Swan Bitcoin and said that his friends were waiting for a withdrawal exceeding $1 million. However, Swan Bitcoin co-founder Brady Swenson said that the company’s risk department detected and denied the fraudulent withdrawal shortly before Junseth published the interview.

Social engineering victims to surrender login credentials
NVK, the founder of hardware wallet maker Coldcard, took the opportunity to argue against making withdrawals and custody of bitcoin ‘easy,’ which exposes customers to risk. Three Jay Partners COO Kristoph Jeffers complimented Junseth. “Truly awesome to see someone’s hard-earned savings get protected by some random anon on the internet,” he said.
Social engineering attacks are, of course, not a new concern in the digital asset world. In 2020, another such attack was behind millions of dollars in thefts that used several prominent Twitter accounts, including those belonging to Elon Musk and Bill Gates. Alleged perpetrators of that scam included a 17-year-old Florida resident.
At its core, social engineering is simply a tactic that convinces victims to surrender their login credentials or send money voluntarily. According to one estimate, 98% of cyberattacks use social engineering: pretending to be a coworker or legitimate support agent. Phishing, baiting, and spoofing are common tactics.
In this case, the medium of attack was a simple phone call from a fraudulent customer support agent. Juneth proved sharp enough to conduct an impromptu interview with a hacker and reverse-socially engineered him into revealing his methodology.

SEC Allocating ‘Grossly Disproportionate’ Amount of Resources to Crypto, Says Lawyer Jake Chervinsky - The Daily Hodl


								Digital asset legal expert Jake Chervinsky thinks the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is allocating a “grossly disproportionate” amount of resources toward regulating crypto.
Chervinsky, the chief legal officer at the crypto fund Variant, blasted the SEC for recently sending out a Wells Notice to Robinhood’s crypto trading arm.










A Wells Notice is a warning issued by the SEC that indicates the regulator is planning to pursue legal action against a company.
Chervinsky argues that the SEC is abusing its power.
“The number [of Wells Notices] they’ve sent about crypto in recent months is astonishing. It’s hard to imagine that they would (or could) bring so many enforcement actions at once. It seems like they’re abusing the Wells process as a scare tactic now.
The SEC allocates a grossly disproportionate amount of its resources to crypto, given that its actual purpose is to regulate equity and debt markets. Every minute and taxpayer dollar spent on crypto is one not spent on the real mission that Congress created the SEC to pursue.”
Last month, Uniswap Labs received a Wells Notice from the SEC. The regulator has also accused Coinbase, Binance and Kraken of violating securities laws, launching lawsuits against all three exchanges last year.

JPMorgan, Mastercard, Wells Fargo and US Banking Giants Explore New Ledger-Based Settlement With Tokenized Assets - The Daily Hodl


								America’s biggest financial institutions are collaborating on a new initiative to explore an on-chain settlement system for tokenized cash and assets.
According to an announcement from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), members of the “regulated U.S. financial sector” have launched a Regulated Settlement Network (RSN) proof-of-concept (PoC) that aims to explore the feasibility of a shared ledger that settles tokenized commercial bank money, wholesale central bank money, U.S. Treasury securities and other tokenized assets.










Members of the program include Citi, J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, Swift, TD Bank N.A., U.S. Bank, USDF, Wells Fargo, Visa, and Zions Bancorp. Big 4 accounting firm Deloitte will be providing advisory services, and two additional unnamed vendors will be providing technology infrastructure and legal analysis.
SIFMA is named as the project manager for the program.
According to the announcement, the RSN PoC aims to be an “interoperable network for multi-asset transactions that aim to operate on a 24/7, programmable shared ledger.”
“Building on the results of a previous industry PoC, this project will further research the settlement of tokenized cash and securities on a common system.
The RSN PoC will be conducted in a test environment and will simulate multi-asset transactions in U.S. dollars. The PoC aims to highlight opportunities to improve the operation of multi-asset settlements for domestic users of financial instruments denominated in U.S. dollars.”
Says Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of blockchain & digital assets at Mastercard,
 “As blockchain technology continues to mature, it will be critical for public and private organizations to partner closely to explore how it can be applied to solve for real-world pain points and improve efficiencies. The application of shared ledger technology to dollar settlements could unlock the next generation of market infrastructures – where programmable settlements are 24/7 and frictionless.”
Some crypto industry leaders have predicted the adoption of blockchain and tokenized transactions by the traditional financial sector.
Recently, Chainlink (LINK) creator Sergey Nazarov said that a transition was underway, where the legacy financial system migrated its infrastructure into blockchain and smart contract, powered by oracle networks.
“After spending the last few months visiting and speaking to many of the largest central banks, commercial banks and financial market infrastructures, across the world’s top financial centers of New York, London, Sydney, Singapore, Hong Kong, Riyadh and now Dubai/Abu Dhabi, it is now clear to me that the transition of the global financial system into the blockchain/smart contract format, enabled by oracle networks, is well underway and in my opinion, inevitable.”

WBTC Scammer Transfers $71 Million Loot Following Poisoning Fraud


																The individual associated with a recent $71 million wallet phishing attack has finally begun transferring the funds to new addresses.
The scammer’s wallet remained inactive for the last six days after converting the stolen 1,155 WBTC into around 23,000 ETH.
Scammer Transfers Stolen Crypto
The bad actor stole Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on May 3 after creating a wallet address closely resembling the victim’s in an “address poisoning” scam. The address featured similar alphanumeric characters and executed a small transaction to the victim’s account.
Typically, like many investors, the victim validated the authenticity of the wallet address by confirming the matching first and last few characters, a common practice. However, the discrepancy in the middle characters, often obscured on platforms to enhance visual aesthetics, went unnoticed.
On May 8, blockchain investigation firm PeckShield observed suspicious activity involving the stolen funds. The scammer initiated a process of breaking down the looted assets into smaller portions and dispersing them across numerous crypto wallets. This tactic was directed towards diluting the stolen funds and obscuring their traceability.






Approximately 400 crypto wallets were utilized by the scammer to distribute the funds across over 150 wallets. Despite the extensive effort to obfuscate the origin of the stolen funds, PeckShield’s investigation revealed that all the diverted assets can still be traced back to the unidentified scammer as of the current moment.
Crypto Scams Declined in April
The FBI’s 2023 Internet crime report highlighted a concerning rise in cryptocurrency-related scams, resulting in investors losing $3.94 billion last year. This represents over three-quarters of total losses from investment scams during the period.
Meanwhile, April saw a major decrease in crypto losses from hacks and scams. Crypto losses from hacks and scams hit a record low for the month, with only $25.7 million lost, marking the lowest figure since 2021.
The report attributes the 141% decline in losses primarily due to the absence of private key compromises. There were 11 attacks targeting protocols via private key compromises in March, whereas April witnessed only three such incidents.
Of the $25.7 million total losses reported for April, $21 million was due to exploits, with only three breaches surpassing $1 million in damages each. Flash loan attacks accounted for $129,000 in losses, with the largest incident causing $55,000 in damages, the lowest incidence of flash loan attacks since February 2022.

Robinhood Sees Massive Dogecoin Outflows After Wells Notice - DailyCoin


        
The Securities and Exchange Commission targeted Robinhood on May 4, 2024.



Crypto whales cash out 164M DOGE as Robinhood’s outflow streak escalates.



Dogecoin slips below critical support at $0.15 despite rising trading volumes.
Robinhood, a leading American crypto exchange, recently received a Wells Notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On May 4, the SEC’s move was met with discontentment, as this notice included advice to the commission to file for enforcement action due to Robinhood allegedly breaching multiple securities laws.164M DOGE Pulled Out Of Troubled ExchangeMeanwhile, large cryptocurrency investors took it as a warning sign and started withdrawing money from the popular California-based exchange. Intriguingly, the top dog memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) got caught up in this whirlpool with multiple multi-million DOGE withdrawals from the platform. One huge DOGE whale cashed out 164 million DOGE a few hours ago, converting to $25 million at stamped transaction time.Following the events, DOGE plunged by 5.8% over the past 24 hours. However, the latest price decline can hardly be attributed to the outflows on Robinhood, as moving a cryptocurrency from an exchange to a self-custodial wallet is usually favorable for the cryptocurrency in question.
In addition, Dogecoin has been exhibiting a very high price correlation with Bitcoin (BTC), as both Dogecoin and Bitcoin operate on the same Proof of Work (PoW) consensus. They are the only two cryptocurrencies in the TOP 10 by global market capitalization with such a mechanism.Dogecoin’s Dip: Shake Out Before New Heights?On the road to the $0.20 price target, DOGE is facing a serious obstacle. It dropped below the $0.15 support level and risked falling into a relatively smaller support bubble. The price range between $0.146 and $0.162 has a volume of 9.33B DOGE at 229.61K cryptocurrency addresses.IntoTheBlock’s on-chain data suggest that the narrower price range between $0.143 to $0.146 has 50.23K crypto addresses holding a total volume of 2.77 billion. Dogecoin backtracking to this price range could send DOGE below for a stronger support cluster.According to experienced cryptocurrency trader The DOGE Coach, Dogecoin’s potential to restore the $0.17 price range midway to the long-term goal of $0.20 is huge, given that the weekly close is above $0.162. As of press time, DOGE trades at $0.1488, with a 5.8% drop over the past 24 hours, slimming the weekly rise to 20%.
Wednesday’s crypto market pullback didn’t put extra sell pressure on the top dog coin, as bids for Dogecoin outweigh the asks by over $14 million. Additionally, the meme coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains relatively neutral at 47, hinting that a fresh tide of new DOGE holders is likely.On the Flipside
While Dogecoin’s trading volume on Spot markets has topped $1 billion over the latest 24-hour timeframe, the massive activity plunge on Derivatives markets has contributed towards DOGE’s price losing steam on Wednesday.

LTC demand surges as users pay 2x more with Litecoin than with Bitcoin


The demand for Litecoin’s (LTC) payment solution surged in April, reaching a record ratio of nearly 2:1 against Bitcoin (BTC) in BitPay. This higher demand is also observed in on-chain coin velocity data, giving strong fundamentals for long-term sustained and organic growth.
In particular, Finbold retrieved data from BitPay on May 8, showing that nearly two times more payments were made with Litecoin than with Bitcoin on the platform. BitPay is a leading cryptocurrency payment service provider, having over 54,000 crypto transactions processed in April.
Notably, approximately 22,345 of these payments used Litecoin, for a 41.38% dominance over the other available cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was the second-most used payment method, with over 11,635 transactions, or 21.55% of the total.


This makes a ratio of 1.92:1 for LTC payments over BTC, achieving nearly two times more demand.

Litecoin vs. Bitcoin payment count and price growth
Interestingly, Litecoin’s payment count has steadily increased in the past 10 years, with a notable correlation with the LTC price. This growth suggests that demand for payments in the network could affect the market demand for the coin, favoring prices.
Finbold retrieved this data from Santiment on May 8, 2024, tracing back to May 7, 2014, through Sanbase Pro.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s payment count has grown slower over the years and is now experiencing a drop. A similar drop was previously seen in 2021 during a network fee spike. Currently, the drop happened after the average transaction fees of BTC reached record highs above $100.

With Bitcoin fees skyrocketing and payments becoming more difficult, cryptocurrency users have migrated to more efficient protocols such as Litecoin. Other alternatives include Nano (XNO), a zero-fee network, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Monero (XMR), and Dogecoin (DOGE).
As of this writing, LTC trades at $81.62 per coin. Additionally, Litecoin has over 2.78 million on-chain payments registered in the last seven days. Bitcoin’s seven-day payments count registers 4.73 million—at a 1.7:1 ratio against Litecoin—a remarkably low ratio, considering BTC has 205 more capitalization than LTC.

Solana's Co-founder makes strong case for meme coins; spotlights memecoin migration from ETH to Solana ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
In a recent development, the co-founder of Solana, one of the most popular proof-of-stake networks, has shown support for meme coin-based cryptos.



Raj Gokal, one of the masterminds behind Solana, has taken to X, formerly Twitter, to support meme coins despite criticism from prominent cryptocurrency enthusiast personalities.



In response to the CTO of venture capitalist firm a16z, who has remained very critical of memecoins, Gokal insists that meme-inspired tokens are not a threat to the broader crypto market. He further implies that memecoins appeal to a younger audience, which is essential for the advancement of the industry.







Gokal’s statement comes not long after a16z’s Eddy Lazzarin expressed his concerns over the role of memecoins in the industry this time. He maintains that memecoins have no technical allure and explains why said tokens are not appealing to builders in the space. 



“Besides undermining the long-term vision of crypto that has kept so many of us in the space, memecoins aren’t very technically interesting. It shouldn’t be a surprise that they’re not attractive to builders.” Lazzarin wrote.

Lazzarin amplifies perceived downsides of memecoins



Another prominent crypto figure took a more critical approach, refuting Lazzarin’s claims, insisting that the mass adoption of meme coins across chains like Base, Blast, and Solana amplified their collective appeal.



It bears mentioning that Lazzarin’s perspective on meme coins mirrors that of a broader audience in the cryptocurrency community. Memecoins have received widespread acceptance and criticism from the entire digital finance industry.



While Elon Musk has championed the leading meme coin, Dogecoin, other key players reject the presence of meme coins, citing their volatility as a major downside.



Amplifying the sentiments of critics, Lazarrin is quoted saying, 



“Memecoins alter how the public, regulators, and entrepreneurs see crypto. At best, it looks like a risky casino. Or a series of false promises masking a casino. This deeply affects adoption, regulation/laws, and builder behavior. I see the damage every day. You should too.”



On a fundamental level, meme coins are progressively attempting to scale their internal community. Notably, Shiba Inu (SHIB), the decentralized cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum blockchain, is making attempts to address Ethereum’s low transaction speed through the introduction of Shibarium.

US lawmakers introduce bill to suspend crypto mixer transactions

US lawmakers have proposed a new bill that aims to temporarily prevent financial institutions from engaging in transactions involving funds that have been through crypto mixers.Congressman Sean Casten (IL-06) introduced the bill on May 7 and received support from Representatives Bill Foster, Brad Sherman, and Emmanuel Cleaver.Blockchain Integrity ActThe proposed legislation, dubbed the Blockchain Integrity Act, seeks to impose a two-year moratorium on financial institutions, such as crypto exchanges, virtual asset service providers (VASPs), and other registered money service businesses (MSBs), from accepting incoming funds routed through a mixer. It also aims to bar outgoing funds from being withdrawn directly to a known mixer address.During this period, the bill mandates the Treasury Department, SEC, CFTC, and DOJ to conduct a comprehensive study on digital asset mixers, privacy coins, and anonymity-enhancing technologies. This study includes analyzing statistics on their illicit uses, insights into legitimate applications, and crafting tailored legislative suggestions to counter illegal activities by specific perpetrators.A crypto mixer is a service used to “mix” diverse crypto funds with others to obscure their origin. Typically, this involves pooling source funds from various inputs over an extended random period before redistributing them to destination addresses.Congressman Casten expressed the opinion that digital asset mixers should be treated as potential tools for money laundering unless subjected to rigorous audits. He claimed that digital assets have been used to finance terrorist activities globally in recent years, adding that:“A temporary ban while we study this technology will help us better understand how it is used for illicit purposes, prevent future crypto-funded terrorism, and inform future policymaking.”Similarly, Congressman Foster emphasized that mixers enable malicious actors to perpetrate financial crimes undermining US security. Meanwhile, Congressman Sherman noted mixers aid in achieving crypto’s objective of facilitating concealed transactions.Notably, this bill emerges amidst heightened scrutiny by US authorities on mixers, alleging that these privacy-enhancing services facilitate illicit financial activities.

Ethereum Game ‘Fantasy Top‘ Now One of Crypto's Most Profitable Apps - Decrypt

Fantasy Top, a fantasy football-esque Ethereum NFT game that turns Crypto Twitter influencers into trading cards, has seen a surge in attention since launching just one week ago on layer-2 network Blast. In fact, it’s making so much money in fees and revenue that it’s now included in the same conversations that surround many leading blockchain networks.Over the last week, Fantasy Top has been the fifth most profitable crypto protocol, according to on-chain data tracked by DefiLlama, with $9.31 million worth of ETH. It earned by selling NFT card packs and taking a cut of trades via its secondary marketplace.Only Bitcoin ($22.1 million), Ethereum ($21.6 million), liquid staking protocol Lido ($18.2 million), and decentralized exchange Uniswap ($15.9 million) generated more fee revenue during that span. And over the past 24 hours, Fantasy Top lands in seventh place with about $925,000 in revenue, with the Tron and Solana networks rising above for the daily tally.Fantasy Top has quickly become a crypto industry sensation, particularly on Crypto Twitter—because it’s based on and built around the social media sphere. The game’s 120 unique “heroes,” which were turned into tradable NFTs on Ethereum layer-2 network Blast, are all based on notable industry traders, investors, analysts, and content creators.As in fantasy sports games—and particularly NFT-based versions like soccer game Sorare—Fantasy Top players must create a lineup of their owned heroes, and then they’ll earn points based on the real-life Twitter (aka X) engagement of the influencers in question.Many of the in-game heroes in question have also been playing the game themselves, driving attention and spending in the process. And there’s good reason for them to: They’re being paid a cut of all pack sales and secondary market trading fees.Late Monday, the game paid out $1.25 million in Ethereum (ETH) split between heroes, as well as potentially millions of dollars worth of Blast Gold—points for the upcoming BLAST token airdrop. And that was from less than one week of play since the mainnet launch. That amount, of course, would come from the aforementioned revenue total.However, the Fantasy Top rollout hasn’t come without challenges. On Wednesday, the game’s creators said they had prematurely ended the first in-game “Main Competition” that began Monday because heroes’ social media content engagement totals were manipulated and boosted—apparently due to automated bots.Fantasy Top says it will share the results of the competition soon, along with details on how it plans to address botting issues in the future.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

DOGE Is The 'BTC Of Memes' And These Two Meme Coins Are The ETH And A 'Must Have,' Trader Touts - Benzinga

Crypto trader Intuitio drew parallels between the roles of Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD and the emerging hierarchy in meme coins, dubbing Dogecoin DOGE/USD as the “BTC of memes” that paves the way for the rest.What Happened: The trader likened Dogecoin to Bitcoin, describing it as “extremely safe, almost too safe,” and identified Pepe and Dogwifhat as the Ethereum of meme coins that are “obvious winners” with the “best Risk/Reward.”He further categorized meme coins into three classes: Dogecoin (BTC equivalent), Pepe PEPE/USD, and Dogwifhat WIF/USD (ETH equivalent) and all other meme coins, offering more risk and potential gain.Intuitio advised against investing in Dogecoin for those who are not "huge whales," suggesting a portfolio allocation of 70% Pepe/Wif and 30% cat memes or political memes for success.Also Read: These Two Meme Coins Will Hit A ‘$10B Valuation By Summer,’ Crypto Trader PredictsWhy It Matters: According to Intuitio, the current stage of the meme coin cycle is still very early, offering the potential for massive gains, but the market has already indicated what to expect.He suggests that investors should approach meme coin allocation like the traditional portfolio allocation between Bitcoin, Ethereum and altcoins.While meme coins are meant for quick and high returns compared to Bitcoin, they should be traded with caution due to their extremely volatile nature.

LocalMonero Calls It Quits: Is Regulatory Pressure to Blame? - DailyCoin


        
P2P trading platform LocalMonero announced the end of its operations.



The platform did not give a specific reason for its closure.



US authorities have ratcheted up enforcement actions against crypto firms lately.
The crypto industry has faced intensifying enforcement actions from US authorities lately. From the arrest of the developers behind the privacy-focused Samourai Wallet to the SEC’s crackdown on centralized exchanges like Robinhood, regulators have ramped up their efforts to bring the sector in line with anti-money laundering and securities laws.
Amid this increasing regulatory hostility, long-standing peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform LocalMonero announced it would be winding down its operations, stoking rumors that the government’s widening crypto crackdown may have influenced the platform’s decision to close.LocalMonero No MoreIn an announcement on May 7, LocalMonero cited “a combination of internal and external factors” as the reasons behind its decision to shutter operations after nearly seven years in business. The P2P platform, one of the oldest fiat onramps for the privacy coin Monero, stated that its business would begin winding down immediately.The platform immediately halted new signups and ad postings. Existing users will be able to trade until May 14, after which new trades are prohibited. The platform will go offline completely on November 7, giving users until that date to withdraw any remaining funds. LocalMonero advised users to reclaim arbitration bond wallets before the November 7 deadline; otherwise, the remaining funds would be considered forfeited.Despite closing its service, LocalMonero expressed confidence in Monero’s future, pointing to “the imminent launch of Haveno and other DEXs like Serai, atomic swaps, the coming addition of FCMP (Full chain member proofs,” which refers to an update that solves a vulnerability in Monero’s anonymizing protocol.
While the LocalMonero team remained outwardly optimistic about Monero’s prospects after the closure, several prominent voices in the community voiced grave concerns over what this could mean for users’ rights.The War on Crypto Expressing concerns over the LocalMonero closure, freedom maximalist Seth For Privacy called the hostile regulatory landscape a “war.” He urged his followers to “band together” and educate themselves on using digital privacy tools.Echoing those sentiments, influencer Chris Blec likened the government’s hardline approach to the crypto industry to “terrorism,” arguing that agencies are creating “an indomitable culture of fear” by overreaching beyond their interpretation of the law.Alex Daneo, co-founder of LocalMonero, made the shutdown announcement on Reddit. While expressing gratitude to users thanking the platform, he did not use the opportunity to expand on the specific reasons for calling it a day.On the Flipside
The Federal Action Task Force warned that P2P platforms risk illicit financing misuse and that privacy coins are a red flag.



A campaign of centralized exchanges delisting privacy coins is well underway.
Why This MattersThe closure of LocalMonero marks the end of an era for one of the oldest and most well-known non-custodial fiat onramps for Monero (and Bitcoin). Privacy-focused projects face great uncertainty as the line between privacy and illicit activity is enforced.Brian Armstrong calls on stakeholders to support pro-crypto politicians:Coinbase Boss Wants Pro-Crypto Officials to End SEC StingSEC chair Gensler insists crypto crackdown is for investors’ benefit:Gary Gensler Defends Robinhood Action: SEC Follows the Law

Biden administration to veto overturning of controversial SEC crypto rules

The Biden administration said on May 8 that it would veto H.J. Res. 109, which intends to overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121).The administration said it “strongly opposes” the resolution as the change will interfere with the SEC’s efforts to protect crypto market investors and safeguard the financial system. The administration added that the SEC released the bulletin due to demonstrated risks that have caused customer losses, and it reflects “considered SEC staff views.”The Biden administration said that lawmakers’ invocation of the Congressional Review Act would inappropriately control the SEC’s ability to create guardrails and address crypto issues. Such limits would introduce financial instability and market uncertainty.The notice concluded:“If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 109, he would veto it.”House scheduled to voteThe US House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the resolution on May 8.Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee Patrick McHenry delivered statements supporting the resolution, calling SAB 121 “one of the most glaring examples” of SEC overreach under its current chair, Gary Gensler.He asserted the agency avoided public comment and the rulemaking process as required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by labeling the requirements for staff guidance.McHenry called SAB 121 “cost-prohibitive” to banks that aim to provide custody for customer crypto and warned that reducing bank participation could leave user assets vulnerable.Representative Tom Emmer has also supported the overturning of SAB 121. Congressman Mike Flood initially sponsored the resolution.Industry implicationsSAB 121 requires financial institutions and firms that safeguard customer crypto to hold the assets on their balance sheet.SAB 121 has also received pushback from within the banking industry itself. The American Bankers Association (ABA) said in February that the policy has posed challenges since its introduction in 2022.ABA noted two main problems — SAB 121 makes it “practically impossible” for banks to act as custodians for spot Bitcoin ETFs due to reserve and capital requirements, and the bulletin fails to distinguish between cryptos on public ledgers and traditional assets on permissioned ledgers.Despite its dissatisfaction with the current rules, the ABA has asked the SEC to modify SAB 121 rather than overturn it entirely.Mentioned in this article

Bitcoin Sharks Show Most Aggressive Buying Spree Ever: Data


								On-chain data shows that Bitcoin investors holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have been on an unprecedented buying spree in the past two months.
Bitcoin Supply Held By Sharks Has Sharply Gone Up Recently
As analyst Willy Woo explains in a new post on X, a group of high-net-worth Bitcoin investors has been buying heavily recently. More specifically, these holders are carrying between 100 and 1,000 BTC in their wallets right now.
At the current cryptocurrency exchange rate, the lower bound of this range is about $6.2 million, while the upper one is about $62 million. Investors of this size are popularly known as “sharks.”

Given these large holdings, sharks can exert some influence in the market, although they are less significant than the whales, the largest holders (1,000+ BTC).
Below is the Glassnode chart shared by Woo, which displays the trend in the total amount of Bitcoin supply held by the investors belonging to this range over the last few years:

The value of the metric seems to have sharply gone up in recent weeks | Source: @woonomic on X
Note that the supply measured isn’t of the addresses holding 100 to 1,000 BTC but rather of “entities” owning an amount in this range. An entity is a collection of addresses that Glassnode has identified as belonging to the same investor through its analysis.
Entities provide a more accurate representation of the market, as some investors like to spread out their holdings across multiple wallets. Transactions between an investor’s addresses would naturally not be relevant for the wider market but would count as buying or selling if only addresses are considered.
The graph shows that the supply held by the Bitcoin shark entities has grown rapidly over the last two months or so. This increase implies that the cohort as a whole has participated in aggressive accumulation.
No buying phase from this cohort during the past few years has come close to the scale of this latest rise. As the long-term view of the same indicator shared by Woo suggests, this latest shopping spree stands out even compared to historical accumulation streaks.

Regarding the BTC value, this buying streak may not be the single largest in the coin’s history. Still, while the cryptocurrency has been trading at extremely high prices in the $60,000 to $70,000 range, this accumulation makes it the most impressive USD value.
To some, however, this latest accumulation looks unnatural due to its sharpness. On-chain analyst Checkmate has argued that this metric would largely measure coins going into smaller exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Woo, though, has countered by suggesting that the ETFs wouldn’t be enough to account for the rise, so there has to be some demand from non-central entities present here.

Checkmate has remained skeptical, finding it hard to believe an army of large investors would buy tens of billions of Bitcoin in this short period. The analyst rather thinks the data is more reflecting wallet management by an exchange or other custodial entity.

Institutional Crypto Firm Anchorage Digital Accumulates Eight Figures Worth of Ethereum DeFi Coin: Lookonchain - The Daily Hodl


								Crypto bank Anchorage Digital is drawing attention for suddenly accumulating massive amounts of one decentralized finance (DeFi) altcoin.
Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says that Anchorage Digital has used 13 wallets in the past month to accumulate more than $49.4 million worth of MKR, the native token for the DeFi protocol Maker.










The most recent purchases came on Monday, with Anchorage Digital using two newly created wallets to acquire $6.28 million worth of MKR from Binance, according to Lookonchain.
MKR is trading for $2,816 at time of writing, down 1.4% in the last 24 hours.
Lookonchain also noticed one savvy deep-pocketed investor made a quick $3 million after buying a massive amount of Bitcoin (BTC) during last week’s market correction, when the top crypto asset dipped into the high $50,000 range.
“Make more than $3 million in just four days! The whale who bought BTC at the bottom [on May 3rd] deposited 767 BTC ($48.46 million) to Binance for profit [on May 6th]. After the market dropped, he withdrew 767 BTC ($45.44 million) at $59,226 BTC from Coinbase on May 3.

$85,200 Bitcoin Before Summer? Glassnode Analysts Say BTC Breaking Out of Bullish Technical Pattern - The Daily Hodl


								The founders of crypto analytics platform Glassnode say that Bitcoin (BTC) may reach $85,200 before summer if a technical setup plays out.
In a new thread, the co-founders of Glassnode , who go by the handle Negentropic on the social media platform X, tell their 62,800 followers that the crypto king appears to be breaking out of a bullish pennant pattern.










 “BTC [is] currently in process of breaking [the] trendline of Pennant and the 50 Daily SMA (simple moving average). When the level [of] $65,000-$66,000 is broken, BTC will move on to first $73,500, then $76,500, and chances are that we see $85,200 before the Summer.”
Source: Negentropic/X
Negentropic goes on to note that the top crypto asset by market cap had a bearish weekend marked by liquidations of long positions. The Glassnode co-founders say that if BTC continues to consolidate, it could shoot past the $65,000 resistance level to $70,000.
 “BTC has recovered – but bearish sentiment persists. BTC rebounded from bear market territory over the weekend amidst a weaker dollar. 
Yet, bearish sentiment persists with a high-risk signal. Liquidations of long positions cooled the perpetual markets. If consolidation continues, a breakthrough of $65,000 resistance could revive momentum to $70,000.”
Source: Negentropic/X
However, over the weekend, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen said that he believes BTC’s rally may be short-lived as it is currently acting as a more volatile version of the stock market.
According to Cowen, BTC may be following in the footsteps of the Russell 2000 Index, NASDAQ and S&P 500. Cowen says the three major stock indexes rose to around their 50-day simple moving average (SMA) before correcting – a pattern he says BTC could follow.
Bitcoin is trading for $62,289 at time of writing, a 2.22% decrease during the last 24 hours.

SEC's Targeting of Ripple's Stablecoin Explained by Analyst


Alexander Grieve, Paradigm's government affairs lead, has attempted to decode the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's recent attack on Ripple's stablecoin project. As noted by Grieve, the mention of Ripple's stablecoin project, which is yet to be named, came after it became clear that the stablecoin legislation would not be attached to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2024. This presented an opportunity for the SEC to go after the SEC in its recent filing. The agency mentioned that Ripple was gearing up to launch an "unregistered crypto asset." The stablecoin project was unveiled by the San Francisco-based company last month. So far, the lawmakers are still conducting negotiations over the content of the stablecoin bill. Last month, U.S. House Representative Maxine Waters (D-California) hinted that its final version could be ready in the near future. As reported by U.Today, Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) introduced a new version of their stablecoin legislation in April. Notably, the bill would make it illegal to issue algorithmic stablecoins. "The Lummis-Gillibrand and McHenry-Waters stablecoin bills leverage prudential oversight (i.e. Fed, OCC, FDIC, state regulators) for stablecoin regulation…The SEC (a PWG member!) doesn't seem to care," Grieve said. He further stressed that stablecoin issuers currently do not have to register with the SEC, which is why he finds the "unregistered" part puzzling.  He urged Congress to pass "technology neutral" and "sensible" stablecoin legislation that would put an end to the SEC's "farcical efforts." Paradigm hired Grieve last year in order to be able to influence U.S. cryptocurrency policy. Back then, he noted that there was "legislative momentum" in Congress, which means that the industry's efforts were not in vain. He also cited Ripple's partial win against the SEC as a positive development for the industry.

Vitalik rallies support for temporary smart wallets on Ethereum - Blockworks


Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) on Tuesday that aims to reconcile core developers’ disparate approaches to account abstraction in upcoming hard forks.
The proposal, EIP-7702, is a successor to EIP-3074 which was considered a Candidate For Inclusion (CFI) in Ethereum’s next upgrade known as Prague-Electra — or “Pectra.”
But 3074’s road to CFI status was bumpy, with substantial time spent debating the EIP across multiple All-Core Dev calls since January.
Read more: Gnosis Chain premieres Ethereum’s Dencun hard fork
Developers have sought to provide tangible improvements to end users in the next hard fork, while keeping open various paths towards the “endgame” of account abstraction.
When looking at what could conceivably be moved into production first, 3074 was judged as most realistic.
But it wasn’t without its critics. For instance, Ansgar Dietrichs at the Ethereum Foundation called it “relatively heavy-handed” on the Jan. 18 ACD call, and more recently expressed reservations as well.
Buterin wrote the new proposal in 22 minutes, according to ZeroDev wallet CEO Derek Chiang, although the published proposal also credits Dietrichs alongside Sam Wilson and Matt Garnett.
A new transaction type allows EOAs to operate as smart contract wallets temporarily. At the end of a transaction, they revert to a normal account.
This approach promises to simplify the developers’ tasks by allowing the use of existing contract code and interaction patterns.

“This EIP is designed to be very forward-compatible with endgame account abstraction, without over-enshrining any fine-grained details of ERC-4337 or RIP-7560,” the authors wrote.
Read more: Ethereum devs debate future of account abstraction
Unlike 3074, the new proposal aims to replicate its functionalities without adding new opcodes. By assuming a smart contract’s code temporarily, EOA can perform complex operations like batch transactions, making use of transaction sponsorship, and constrained sub-key operations — a security feature employing secondary keys (sub-keys) that have limited or specific permissions — within a single transaction.
Further down the roadmap, a wallet-centric approach to account abstraction is expected to become the norm. The new EIP is designed to be quite compatible with EIP-4337, rolled out in March 2023, making use of existing wallet code and transaction frameworks to minimize disruption and duplication of effort.
Read more: Ethereum Improvement Proposals to watch in 2024
7702 has rallied support from 3074 proponents like core developers Garnett and Andrew Ashkhmin, as well as important dapp developers including Uniswap’s Hayden Adams.
Opposition to the previously included improvement had grown in recent months, as more developers became aware it was on a path to become part of the next Ethereum upgrade.
Ethereum’s governance operates on principles of consensus-building, where points of contention are meticulously debated in public, both on group calls and online forums, until a clear course of action emerges.
Independent development teams then agree on shared specifications, which are coded into new versions of their respective Ethereum clients.
Ultimately, operators of thousands of validators must concur to install the new software versions at sufficient scale to successfully initiate a hard fork at an agreed upon date.
The next such upgrade, Pectra, is tentatively scheduled for Q4 2024.

Ripple's XRP Risks Another Blow As SEC Labels Its Stablecoin Project As An ‘Unregistered Crypto Asset’ ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Silicon Valley crypto mainstay Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have made considerable progress in their legal brawl, with the securities regulator recently filing its final reply in the case’s remedies stage before Judge Analisa Torres makes her ruling.



SEC Fires Shots In Final Response To Ripple



In the Tuesday redacted brief, the SEC described Ripple’s proposed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin as an “unregistered crypto asset,” contending that it proves the firm’s potential to continue conducting unregulated activities without a permanent injunction.



As ZyCrypto reported previously, Ripple unveiled its stablecoin plans in early April. The “enterprise-grade” crypto, expected later this year, will be launched across the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains. The as-yet-unnamed crypto stablecoin will be backed 1-to-1 by cash equivalents including U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. government bonds, and other low-risk investments.



Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz said the company will reveal the name of the stablecoin project in June.



The SEC claims that Ripple’s main business has been the unregistered institutional sales of XRP since its launch and will continue if a permanent injunction is not granted.

The commission further pushed back against Ripple’s assurances that it would not break federal securities law because of its licenses in other jurisdictions, comparing the argument to “saying a New York restaurant need not obtain a liquor license because it obtained a fishing license in California.”



XRP Lawsuit “Closer Than Ever” To Conclusion



The question of whether XRP is a security won’t be answered until the Ripple-SEC four-year courtroom showdown concludes after appeals. At the moment, it’s a complicated situation. Judge Analisa Torres declared last July that XRP is NOT a security when traded on crypto exchanges, albeit it qualifies as an investment contract when Ripple sells the token to institutional investors.



In the Ripple vs. SEC case, the stakes are high financially. The regulator insists that the court should impose a substantial penalty on Ripple to discourage both the blockchain payments firm and possible copycats from similar actions in the future. While the SEC demands fines and penalties totaling $2 billion, Ripple maintains that a maximum penalty of $10 million is enough.



Ripple’s legal head, Stuart Alderoty, has slammed the SEC’s latest brief as baseless, describing it as another example of the agency’s failure to apply the law. Alderoty also noted that Ripple is “closer than ever” to leaving the suit behind them:



“More of the same from the SEC — failing to faithfully apply the law and trying to pull the wool over the Judge’s eyes. The good news is that we are closer than ever to putting this lawsuit behind us, though unfortunately, many are just starting the journey.”



XRP was trading for $0.5259 at press time, down 2.2% on the day.

Will Using AI Like ChatGPT Make You Dumber? Scientists Weigh In - Decrypt

The potent combination of the internet and ubiquitous smartphones led us to ask whether we should bother remembering anything if the world’s knowledge is readily available anywhere we go. With the rapid mainstream adoption of AI, people are naturally discovering ways to minimize—or avoid—work. But what could that mean for our brains?Among college students, at least, excessive use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT can lead to procrastination, memory loss, and lower academic performance, according to a recent study that asked, “Is it harmful or helpful?”The research—published in the International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education—found that students who faced higher academic workloads and time pressure were more likely to use ChatGPT. However, increased use of the AI tool ultimately hurt their grades."Not surprisingly, use of ChatGPT was likely to develop tendencies for procrastination and memory loss and dampen the students' academic performance," the study warned.Image: Muhammad Abbas/International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher EducationStudents who frequently used ChatGPT for their academic tasks had poorer cumulative grade point averages (CGPAs), according to the study, which the authors note aligns with growing concerns raised by educators who consider AI use “deeply harmful to a social understanding of knowledge and learning,” with the potential to “kill creativity and critical thinking.”Lead author Muhammad Abbas did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.The researchers do acknowledge some benefits of leveraging AI tools, noting that students who are concerned about “excellence, accuracy, and reliability in their work” are more likely to use ChatGPT to help with “grammar, style, and language precision.”Nonetheless, they recommend using AI only when absolutely necessary.“Over-reliance on external sources, including generative AI tools, without personal engagement and active learning, can hinder the development of essential skills and the depth of knowledge required for academic success," they wrote.Beyond the classroomWhile AI is relatively new, this latest study is hardly the first to explore the impact of the emerging technology, with scores of researchers focused on its implications for education and work.A regional study of 285 undergraduate students published by the scientific magazine Nature found that AI use can lead to laziness and addiction among users, particularly in educational settings.“The findings show that 68.9% of laziness in humans, 68.6% in personal privacy and security issues, and 27.7% in the loss of decision-making are due to the impact of artificial intelligence in Pakistani and Chinese society,” the study said.  “From this, it was observed that human laziness is the most affected area due to AI.”The Nature study also warned that lazier students aren’t the only worrisome outcome. As users increase their use of AI, the researchers said, over-reliance on technology for even simple tasks can result in a loss of human skills—and increased stress when physical or mental measures are later required.The researchers concluded that AI can negatively impact human cognitive abilities by reducing the need for mental effort and analytical thinking, potentially leading to a decline in problem-solving and decision-making skills.A separate report published by Goldman Sachs in 2023 argued that “shifts in workflows triggered by these advances could expose the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs to automation.” The Informing Science Institute has meanwhile warned that the constant use of AI in the job market may increase the pace at which skills become obsolete—requiring workers to adapt by either investing in education or pivoting their professional expertise to remain relevant.Image: Goldman SachsThese are darker scenarios than the happy vision of a jobless society painted by Elon Musk and others who embrace technological utopianism.It’s not just AIArtificial intelligence may be the latest disruptive technology to shake the foundations of society, but it’s only the latest in a series of tectonic shifts in recent history.In 2014, a group of UCLA researchers conducted an experiment involving two groups of children from a California public school. One group, the control, proceeded without making any changes to their routines. The other went camping, cut off from social media and smartphone interactions. After the digital detox, both groups were shown video clips to assess their ability to understand human emotions.“Researchers found that children deprived of all digital media performed significantly better at interpreting emotions than those allowed to access social media,” CTV news reports.Just as AI minimizes the need for critical thinking to solve problems or complete tasks, smartphones and social media increased distractions and reduced physical human interactions.Even simple communication between people is being changed by tech. A notable 2017 study honed in on the trend toward using emojis and abbreviations in shorter text messages, and concluded the practice impaired the ability to participate in longer, more nuanced conversations that demand better listening and speaking skills.In other words, popular trends such as "explain this to me like I'm five," the "I ain't reading all that" meme, or even the total disregard for capitalization notably practiced by Sam Altman, are all ways tech trends are changing society—and arguably making us less intelligent.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Ethereum Faces Solana Challenge as Validator Income Rises - DailyCoin


        
Analyst shows Solana approaching Ethereum in total validator inome.



High income on Solana makes becoming a validator more attractive.



However, traders in DeFi run the risk of validators frontrunning their trades. 
The blockchain ecosystem is witnessing fierce competition between Ethereum and Solana as they fight to attract validators. The more validators there are, the more secure a network is and the more demand for the token in proof-of-stake (PoS) systems. 
Recent data from one analyst suggests that Solana could soon surpass Ethereum in the total value validators can derive from their activities. Solana Set to Outpace Ethereum in Validator IncomeOn Tuesday, May 7, Dan Smith, a senior research analyst at Blockworks, shared data indicating that Solana’s total economic value was nearing that of Ethereum. In particular, Solana might soon surpass Ethereum in total transaction fees and Maximum Extractable Value (MEV). On May 6, the combined figures for Ethereum stood at $3,165, while the same figure for Solana was not far off, at $2,803. Smith’s analysis suggested that Solana could “flip” Ethereum soon, perhaps within a week. Critically, the flipping relies on the relatively high MEV Solana validators can extract, as Solana fees are still trailing Ethereum, standing at $1.49 million vs $2.75 million for Solana. Initially known as Miner Extractable Value, MEV is the maximum potential profit validators can capture by reordering, including, or excluding transactions in a way that generates extra profit. MEV isn’t charged directly to the user, such as transaction fees; it’s extracted from opportunities like arbitrage, front-running, or liquidations.Why Solana MEV Figures Are So HighSolana validators are relatively well-positioned to profit from sources other than fees. For one, Solana’s low fees and high speed boost transaction volume, leading to more opportunities for arbitrage. The more transactions there are, the higher the fees and MEV the validators can get. 
At the same time, low fees and high speeds make it easier for validators to profit from MEV strategies. With transaction costs being less of a barrier, validators can engage in a high number of arbitrages, which would be un-economical on Ethereum.  However, this strategy has its shortcomings, in particular due to the ongoing network congestion. The high rate of transaction failures, hovering at 60%, means that validators are unsure whether their transactions will go through. MEV strategies are a mixed bag for traders. For one, validators’ frontrunning hurts traders involved in DeFi, increasing effective transaction costs. At the same time, MEV opportunities make validating more attractive, boosting the demand for the token. On the Flipside
Despite its growth, Solana’s total value locked (TVL) was just $3.96 billion on Wednesday, May 8, compared to Ethereum’s $53 billion.



Solana has suffered multiple outages due to overwhelming demand, causing disruptions that raise concerns about reliability.
Why This MattersAs MEV extraction grows on Solana, traders may face increased front-running risks and higher transaction costs. On the other hand, the heightened validator incentives could boost demand for SOL, potentially impacting the token’s price.Read more about Solana’s prospects for dominance: Here’s How Solana Can Outpace BNB and USDT: Franklin TempletonRead more about how to get certified in blockchain: Bitget Trains Over 6,000 Students: Here’s How to Get Certified

Chainalysis sets up Dubai HQ, bolsters UAE's crypto ambitions


Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics company, opened its regional headquarters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates’ most populous city, the firm announced on Wednesday.



The establishment of the forensics firm’s Dubai headquarters is a strategic step that underscores the company’s commitment to fostering a strong regulatory environment for the crypto industry in collaboration with the UAE government and local financial institutions, Chainalysis said.



The new office will cater to Southern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa, aiming to support the growing crypto markets in these regions. 



This move is part of a larger trend of crypto and Web3 companies choosing Dubai for its welcoming policies and ambition to pioneer digital asset innovation.

	
	
	
	


Chainalysis’ expansion into Dubai comes after three years of partnership with the UAE’s public and private sectors, including collaborations with the Ministry of Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications, and a memorandum of understanding with Emirates NBD, a state-owned bank.



“The UAE government has spearheaded the crypto revolution with forward-focused regulations, and business-friendly policies,” said Michael Gronager, chief executive officer of Chainalysis. 



“The true potential and value of cryptocurrencies lies in their ability to transfer value, and we’re seeing an upward trend of overall transfer activity. Utilization is the underlying success story of the industry, and the UAE is strongly positioned to lead innovation with novel use cases that deliver tangible value to consumers and businesses.”

Nigeria Responds to Harsh Allegations by Cryptocurrency Exchange Binance - Bitcoin Sistemi

Nigeria has denied bribery allegations made by Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The Nigerian government described these allegations as a diversionary tactic to prevent focus on Binance's activities.
The denial came in response to a blog post by Binance CEO Richard Teng, who claimed a “secret” payment was requested from the company to resolve issues in Nigeria. Since these allegations emerged, one of Binance employees has been imprisoned in the country.


Teng accused unidentified Nigerian government officials of demanding a $150 million cryptocurrency payment to stop the ongoing criminal investigation against Binance. However, Rabiu Ibrahim, spokesman for the country's Ministry of Communications, rejected these claims, calling them baseless and a delaying tactic. Binance has not yet responded to these comments.
The dispute between Binance and Nigeria escalated when the company's activities were blocked and two of its employees were detained in the country. While one of the employees managed to escape, the other, Tigran Gambaryan, continues to be detained on charges of tax evasion, foreign exchange speculation and money laundering. His trial is expected to begin this month.





Teng's blog post detailed a meeting with Nigerian officials in Abuja in early January, during which Binance faced criminal allegations. Teng claimed that after the meeting, Binance staff were offered a payment by “unknown persons” to resolve the claims. The company's lawyer was later “submitted to a significant request for payment in cryptocurrency to be paid secretly within 48 hours to resolve these issues.”

Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla returned to Nigeria at the end of February at the invitation of the authorities and received assurances that they would leave the country safely. Despite these assurances, they were immediately arrested.


Ibrahim stated that the bribery allegation was part of an international campaign to undermine the Nigerian government by Binance, which has been criminally prosecuted in several countries, including the United States. “He will not clear his name in Nigeria by resorting to fictional allegations and smearing media campaigns.” he added.
In Nigeria, Binance has been under scrutiny for months as authorities focus on the role of cryptocurrencies in speculation against the naira, which has lost nearly 65% of its value against the dollar.

Crypto Is an Election Issue This Year. Is That a Good Thing?

Interestingly, crypto seems to be of particular importance in key battleground states including Arizona, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to an online Harris Poll survey of over 1,000 voters in each state commissioned by DCG in early April. One-third of voters with "crypto-positive" views think politicians should make regulating crypto a priority.

After billionth Bitcoin transaction, a look at the network’s evolution - Blockworks


Activity on the Bitcoin network has evolved over the span of a billion transactions, with the latest usage starting to resemble that of Ethereum in 2020.
Bitcoin transaction number 1,000,000,000 occurred at the start of the week, giving an excuse to take a closer look at how a network once used mostly for payments is starting to sport broader utility.
The Runes protocol is a recent driver of Bitcoin blockchain activity, satisfying “a surge of interest in the purchase of memecoins and NFTs,” according to Bitget research analyst Ryan Lee.
Read more: A look into Runes, a new Bitcoin token standard for issuing fungible tokens
The protocol is a fungible token standard designed by Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor. It was created as an alternative to BRC-20. 
Ordinals, which debuted in January 2023, is a protocol used to inscribe individual units of BTC with unique data to create digital collectibles.
Unlike BRC-20, Runes do not depend on the Ordinals mechanism of inscription, Rodarmor said on X.
Runes has accounted for between 10% and 70% of daily Bitcoin transactions in recent weeks, according to Dune Analytics data — reaching as high as 81.3% on April 23.
The majority of activity on the Bitcoin blockchain has historically been payment transactions — a fact that is poised to change as more gets built on top of it.
“Current activity on the Bitcoin network is very similar to the state of the Ethereum blockchain during the boom of dapp projects,” Lee said. “I think it will continue to varying degrees as the number of new projects and add-ons based on Bitcoin grows.”
Bitcoin’s total value locked (TVL) stands at roughly $1.2 billion, according to DeFiLlama data — about what Ethereum’s TVL was four years ago, Lee noted. 
That was a time that preceded a “DeFi boom” that spurred a rise in yield farming, algorithmic stablecoins and new liquidity models, Lee said. Ethereum’s TVL is $53 billion today, making up nearly 60% of the TVL across all blockchains. 
“As DeFi increasingly adopts BRC-20 tokens, which have a potential to displace competitors, Bitcoin may react to these shifts positively due to increased demand,” Lee added.
Compass Point Research & Trading analyst Joe Flynn said in an April 30 note that, unlike prior bitcoin cycles, the addition of protocols built on top of the layer-1 are indeed set to up demand for blockspace. This could lead to periods of congestion “that users will pay up for to be included in the next block,” he added.
Read more: Ordinals are driving up Bitcoin fees — but that may be good for the network
The Bitcoin network’s advanced functionality — like the innovation in standards like BRC-20 — are converging with broader factors set to drive BTC adoption, according to Neo founder Da Hongfei.
One of the most influential was the launch of US spot bitcoin ETFs in January, he noted. Such funds have given retail and institutional investors alike exposure to the crypto asset via a familiar investment vehicle.
The 11-fund category has tallied net inflows of nearly $11.8 billion during the four months they have traded, Farside Investors data shows.“The impact of such an initiative will continue to encourage heightened trading activity, as these new financial instruments become embedded in the traditional financial infrastructure,” Hongfei said.
Not to mention the recent Bitcoin halving — reducing per-block mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC — occurred on April 19. 
Bitcoin’s “immutable monetary policy” and a receptive macro backdrop could spark the crypto market’s “most violent supply squeeze yet,” Hongfei explained — pushing BTC price up. 
That said, industry watchers have argued the current environment could hold back BTC in the coming months before the expected post-halving rally plays out.

Either way, Bitcoin’s DeFi and Web3 capabilities appear poised to help it challenge smart contract networks.
“We anticipate critical mass adoption of Web3 settlement on Bitcoin’s ecosystem within this decade,” Hongfei told Blockworks. “As Bitcoin’s utility and reliability become apparent for global trade and contracts, network effects and technical advantages could propel a mass migration from 2028 to 2030.”
Ethereum is likely to remain a place to test gadgets and “tinkering without jeopardizing critical applications,” the Neo founder added.  
“Both networks would then assume complementary roles,” Hongfei said. “Bitcoin as the supreme base settlement layer and Ethereum pioneering less mission-critical use cases as a secondary chain.”

Mapping the RWA Landscape | Bankless


Are real-world assets crypto’s next frontier?Real World Assets (RWAs) are the talk of the town. Big names like BlackRock are getting into RWAs, Tether is rolling out its own platform, and the numbers are impressive too – RWA tokens reached a record market cap of $2.7 billion in February.With so many major catalysts, the RWA narrative is expected to take center stage in the second half of 2024. Today’s story gives a rundown of the RWA landscape, highlighting the different types of real world assets being tokenized and the standout projects to keep an eye on.Let’s dive in! 👇What's Next for RWAs?RWAs are one of the fastest-growing sectors in crypto. Many see them as a way to tap into the world's trillions in assets, fueling the growth of the entire industry.Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, has called RWAs "the next generation for markets.” The Boston Consulting Group predicts that by 2030, turning these assets into tokens could unlock a $16 trillion opportunity.However, until now, there’s only been one asset that’s been successfully tokenized and fully integrated into the crypto ecosystem, and that’s fiat currency in the form of stablecoins.Stablecoins are the first, the largest, and the most established RWA. They’ve found product market fit in crypto and see strong demand for different services and are a fundamental part of every crypto ecosystem.But what's beyond stablecoins in the RWA space?In recent years, we've seen a growing trend of various real-world assets being tokenized and brought onchain. Let's check out some of the most popular types.Commodities, Equities & FundsCommodities like gold, silver, and crude oil are commonly traded on various exchanges around the world. These natural resources can be tokenized to represent a stake in the actual commodity, much like stablecoins do for fiat currency.So far, precious metals, especially gold, have gained the most traction in crypto as RWAs. Tokens like PAX Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT) are leading the charge, with gold-backed RWAs comprising 83% of the commodity token market cap, as reported by CoinGecko.Daily Market Cap of Commodity-Backed Tokens (CoinGecko 2024 RWA Report)This dominance of gold indicates just how nascent the RWA sector is. However, several projects are experimenting with different commodities. For instance, the Uranium308 project has introduced a token pegged to the price of a pound of U3O8 uranium compound 👀As the RWA tokenization space matures, we might see tokens for other commodities like crude oil and even crops like corn. The thesis is that more global trading will shift onto the blockchain in the future.This could be the future of onchain trading with RWAs.Similar to commodities, stocks, and mutual funds can also be tokenized. These assets are mainstays in the traditional finance market, but their adoption in crypto has been slow, largely due to regulatory hurdles. Complying with laws across jurisdictions is tough, with many projects needing licenses and facing restrictions, like excluding users from certain countries or meeting strict KYC and AML criteria.Despite these challenges, some projects like Swarm and Backed have navigated the regulatory maze, allowing onchain trading of global stocks and funds, like COIN and NVDA from the U.S. markets, and index funds like the Core S&P 500, among others.TreasuriesTreasuries refer to tokenized government debt instruments. Traditionally, these instruments are secure, yield-generating assets as they are issued by governments.Following the COVID-19 pandemic, treasury rates, which were historically low, saw a rise as the Federal Reserve adjusted its monetary policy to the shifting economy. By October 2023, short-term treasury yields had climbed from near zero to approximately 5.4%.
This uptick in rates spurred the launch of projects tokenizing U.S. treasuries, with some notable examples being:Treasury Product Metrics, source: rwa.xyzThis category has seen substantial growth as treasury yields have become more appealing with rising interest rates. Other notable projects in this space include Superstate, Maple, Backed, OpenEden, and more. Onchain Private CreditPrivate credit involves lending by financial institutions to businesses through debt instruments, essentially loans.In the context of the RWA sector in crypto, these loans are tokenized through credit protocols, allowing lenders to extend capital to these institutions in exchange for yield.In traditional finance, private credit is a massive $1.6 trillion market, and it's slowly carving out a significant niche in crypto. Crypto credit protocols have already tokenized over $4.4 billion in loans, with more than $600 million currently loaned out to real-world businesses, generating returns for onchain lenders.For onchain investors, private credit presents an attractive proposition due to its higher yield potential. For example, lending stablecoins through a protocol like Centrifuge can yield an average APY of 8.7%, surpassing the 4-5% APY typically found on platforms like AAVE, though it comes with increased risk.Key players in the private credit space include:Private Credit RWA Protocols, Source: rwa.xyzReal EstateThe real estate category within RWA focuses on tokenizing physical properties like residential houses, land, commercial buildings, and infrastructure projects.Real estate stands as the world's biggest asset class. But traditionally, real estate investment requires significant capital due to the high cost of properties. Making real estate tradable onchain by tokenization introduces a novel investment paradigm, enhancing accessibility, enabling fractional ownership, and potentially increasing liquidity.Nonetheless, real estate's inherent illiquidity has tempered the pace of its onchain adoption. The protracted nature of real estate transactions and the  small buyer pool make it challenging to align sellers with buyers onchain, especially given how the sector has operated on legacy systems traditionally.Projects like RealT Tokens are striving to inject liquidity into the market by simplifying property fractionalization, thus allowing sellers to easily divide their assets and enabling buyers to acquire tokenized shares.Additionally, platforms like Parcl allow for speculation on the value of real estate across various locations, such as different U.S. cities, through their onchain trading mechanisms.All these initiatives will make the real estate market more liquid in the long term.Closing ThoughtsThe concept of RWAs promises to bring a new level of global access and liquidity to traditional assets like real estate, commodities, and debt. Should the bold predictions for RWAs materialize, the tokenization of these assets may well redefine how the world trades these assets and in turn, bring more people onchain.

SEC Objects Ripple's Proposed Stablecoin Launch in New Filing - DailyCoin


        
The SEC’s latest filing against Ripple has reignited concerns over cryptocurrency regulations in the U.S.



Ripple’s plan to launch a dollar-backed stablecoin faces additional hurdles due to the SEC’s stance.



The Ripple lawsuit’s outcome can impact how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the U.S.
The legal battle between Ripple Labs, a blockchain company, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took a new turn this week. A document filed by the SEC reignited concerns over the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the United States.The SEC contends that Ripple’s core business revolves around the unregistered sale of XRP, their native digital asset. This argument, outlined in a redacted remedies reply brief, could have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency industry.SEC Intensifies Scrutiny of Crypto IndustryThe SEC’s actions against Ripple are part of a broader trend of increased scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry. In recent months, the SEC has issued Wells notices, which signal potential enforcement actions, to major crypto players like Uniswap, Consensys, and Robinhood.
In a recent interview, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler emphasized the need for tighter regulations in the crypto space. Citing cryptocurrencies’ significant but potentially risky nature, Gensler highlighted the SEC’s role in safeguarding the $110 trillion capital market. “How do we ensure that the American investor is protected? And right now, they’re not getting the required or needed disclosures. The intermediaries in the center of this rather centralized market are generally conflicted and doing things we would never allow the New York Stock Exchange to do. The New York Stock Exchange is not allowed to trade against the investors,” Gensler stated.Notably, he remained ambiguous on classifying Ethereum (ETH) as a security or commodity, pointing to a lack of adequate investor disclosures. Additionally, he criticized the practices of intermediaries in centralized crypto exchanges.The SEC’s stance and ongoing legal battles, like the one with Ripple Labs, create uncertainty for cryptocurrency companies and investors alike. The final outcome of the Ripple case will likely significantly impact how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the United States.Ripple’s Stablecoin Plans Under ScrutinyThe SEC’s new filing targets XRP and highlights Ripple’s plans to launch a new crypto asset. While the document doesn’t explicitly name the asset, many believe it refers to Ripple’s proposed U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin. 
Earlier this year, reports emerged about Ripple’s intention to create a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, backed by reserves of U.S. Treasuries and dollar deposits. This development adds another layer of complexity to the lawsuit. The SEC’s stance implies that the upcoming stablecoin might also be considered an unregistered security. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, slammed the SEC’s approach, accusing them of misapplying regulations and misleading the court. He expressed confidence in the court’s ability to deliver a fair verdict and criticized the SEC’s disregard for international regulatory frameworks.On the Flipside
The SEC’s approach differs from frameworks in other countries, potentially creating confusion for international crypto businesses.



The lack of clarity on how the SEC classifies Ethereum (ETH) creates uncertainty for other crypto projects. Businesses are left guessing if their tokens will be deemed securities.
Why This MattersThis escalating battle between the SEC and Ripple not only casts a shadow over XRP’s future but also raises questions about the regulatory fate of stablecoins and potentially other crypto assets, creating a climate of uncertainty that could stifle innovation and hinder the growth of the entire US cryptocurrency industry.The recent SEC rebuttal in the Ripple case highlights their ongoing strategy.

Shark Cat Solana Meme Coin Fight Ends Without Legal Battle - Decrypt

After a rough start to their working relationship, the Nala Cat brand and current team behind Solana meme coin Shark Cat (SC) have come to an agreement—giving Shark Cat an official license to the IP. Following a contentious dispute that spilled out onto Twitter, the owner of famed social media feline Nala announced last week that she has reached a deal with the team behind Shark Cat—which originally used photos of the cat to promote its token.The Shark Cat team confirmed that they made a deal with the Nala Cat brand, and acquired a license to use the IP for the meme coin. But after all of the bad blood between the two sides, as previously reported by Decrypt, how did they come to a solution?When the debacle first began, Nala’s pseudonymous owner Pookie had attempted to negotiate a deal with a community-led Shark Cat team after she discovered they’d used Nala’s likeness for their meme coin.Things quickly went south. The Nala Cat team didn’t feel like they were presented fair offers, given that their IP—which is used for a line of cat food, plus other products—was repeatedly used to promote a coin valued at a peak market cap of $390 million in late March. The Shark Cat team, meanwhile, felt like Pookie's request for a sizable chunk of the token supply was not feasible. It didn’t appear that either side was willing to budge on their positions.After Decrypt’s report on the meme coin conflict came out, Pookie said that she started getting emails from several members of the Shark Cat community. She found that a lot of the people reaching out seemed like real, genuine human beings that just wanted to come to a solution.Pookie told Decrypt that seeing how many real people from all over the world were affected by the situation opened her up to coming to an agreement with the Shark Cat team. She was approached by Brandon Sample, a crypto-focused lawyer who read about what was going on and offered to take on her case pro bono. Sample told Decrypt that the conflict was ultimately a learning experience for both sides, and that both Pookie and the Shark Cat team are satisfied with the outcome.“While ‘Code is law’ is a popular mantra in the industry, there are actual laws and frameworks on how to operate when it comes to things like intellectual property,” said Sample.The exact details of the agreement between the two parties are being kept private. The only information Nala’s legal team shared with Decrypt is that it is a licensing deal, and that Shark Cat has the rights to use the Nala Cat brand.Pookie and Sample both stressed that there was no bad blood between the two teams, that they wish the Shark Cat community the best of luck, and that they hope they find success in their endeavors. When reached for comment, a liaison from the Shark Cat community responded, “We swim together now. Shark is a mf cat 🦈🐱.”Shark Cat’s price has rebounded substantially amid the alliance, with the price rising 208% over the past week to a current price around $0.15 per token, according to CoinGecko. It’s still down by 55% from the March 31 peak.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

“Crypto Is a Garden of Snakes:” Rep Sherman Backs SEC Action - DailyCoin


        
The ongoing SEC crypto enforcement actions have gained the support of United States senators.



Policymakers are eyeing bolstered regulations against the asset class.



SEC Chair Gary Gensler has defended the commission’s approach to the industry.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has championed enforcement actions against the crypto industry in recent years, marked by regulatory attacks against service providers and providers in the pursuit of oversight. The intensifying “regulation by enforcement” approach has raised questions regarding the commission’s actions, which have been criticized as hostile and aggressive. Despite this scrutiny, some US policymakers strongly support the commission’s actions.SEC Crypto Enforcement Actions In a Tuesday, May 7 hearing over the Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent regulatory actions, Representative Brad Sherman asserted that the ongoing focus of the regulatory body on the crypto industry is not a coincidence but necessary to ensure orderliness within the financial sector.
Central to Sherman’s support was the indictment of the fallen crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) for an $8 billion investor fraud, which, according to him, reflects the problematic nature of the broader industry. While the commission has often been accused of failing to establish clear regulations for crypto, Rep Sherman stated that the industry has fought tooth and nail against the commission’s regulations in an effort to give itself a patina of regulations.“The crypto industry will tell us that Sam Bankman-Fried a single snake in a garden of crypto Eden, when in fact, Crypto is a garden of snakes,” stated the congressman.Spotlighting the commission’s battles against crypto exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, Sherman reiterated his position as one of the early advocates for specific legal actions against crypto exchanges, asserting the need to “go after the illegal securities exchanges.”
The viability of the crypto asset class as an investment option was also a focal point of discussion. He emphasized that Americans should invest more in stock markets rather than what he described as ephemeral efforts to create new currencies that rival the US dollar and other national currencies.Sherman’s stance aligns with Chair Gary Gensler’s recent defense of the SEC’s actions against the crypto industry.Gensler Refutes Claims of SEC’s Crypto FocusAddressing the SEC’s oversight of the crypto market in a CNBC interview on Tuesday, the SEC chair refused claims that the commission has turned most of its attention to the industry while neglecting the actual financial markets for which it is designated.Gensler stresses that the SEC’s recent enforcement actions are in line with the law, fueled by its responsibility to ensure that investors get the required disclosures on investment options.Much of this field is non-compliant with the protections of our securities laws,” he stated.The SEC chair further emphasized the industry’s challenge of scams and fraud, asserting that they threaten investors and mandate stringent complaint actions to ensure protection.On the Flipside
U.S. lawmakers have suggested the removal of Gary Gensler as SEC Chair.



The latest target in the SEC’s streak of enforcement actions is retail crypto trading platform Robinhood.



In February 2024, five U.S. senators criticized the SEC, under Gensler’s leadership, as unethical and unprofessional and called for a reassessment of its actions.
Why This MattersSherman’s likening of the crypto industry to a garden of snakes highlights the persistent skepticism among some policymakers, indicating the challenges that threaten regulatory clarity. Additionally, his open support for the SEC’s crypto actions contrasts the scrutiny from pro-industry advocates and may further encourage the commission’s anti-crypto stance. Read more about the opposition against the SEC’s actions under Chair Gensler’s leadership:Congress Advocated to Take Action on SEC and Gary GenslerThe SEC’s inaction on Ether ETFs has caused Grayscale to bow out of the approval race, read more:Grayscale Drops Ether Futures ETF Bid as SEC Stalls Approval

Rwandan central bank proceeds with ambitious retail CBDC project

The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) has opened up its just completed feasibility study on a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) to public comment. The BNR is considering a national digital currency that incorporates the latest innovations in the technology and is highly tailored to local conditions.A retail CBDC would advance Rwanda’s cashless economy national initiative and increase the resilience of the financial system, which is still subject to frequent power outages, the BNR found. The central bank expects to spend $35 million on printing and maintaining its cash supply in the next five years, despite its cashless goal. The BNR is proposing an interest-free, intermediated CBDC with interoperability with all the country’s existing payment systems and potentially other CBDCs. after the appropriate amendments to the country’s Central Bank Act are made. It recommended a token-based, rather than account-based, model with open programmability and smart contracts.Tokenization would allow digital cash to be transferred offline using Bluetooth or Near Field Communication (NFC) technology and would not require a smartphone. This is in contrast to current electronic payment options.Programmability would be a mixed blessing, the study noted:“The advantages of open programmability, which facilitates value-added innovative products and services, are expected to outweigh the arguments of privacy and security.” The BNR foresaw no more than “partial pseudo-anonymity” for the CBDC. Related: BIS issues comprehensive paper on offline CBDC paymentsPayment service providers currently make up less than 0.9% of the Rwandan financial sector. The sector is challenged by low financial literacy, high remittance costs and a large informal economy, among other things. The BNR noted that reducing the amount of cash in circulation could formalize more of the economy.The study recommended the imposition of user fees and holding limits, without sorting out details. Public acceptance of a CBDC was also left an open question.Source: Central Bank of RwandaThe BNR favored a distributed database model over a distributed ledger for increased reliability. Its analysis used the World Economic Forum’s CBDC Policy-Maker Toolkit.Tokenized wholesale CBDC projects have been undertaken by Mastercard and Ripple, as well as the European Central Bank and the Bank for International Settlements’ new Project Agora. Tokenization in a retail CBDC may be an innovation. Offline CBDC transfers is also a subject of current research.

Revolut Expands Offering To 40 Million Users, Introduces Crypto Exchange Services | Bitcoinist.com


								In a significant move into the digital asset space, British banking app Revolut has unveiled Revolut X, a dedicated crypto trading platform for UK retail customers. 
According to a Fortune Magazine report, the launch of the new platform signifies Revolut’s commitment to the crypto industry and positions the company to compete with major players like Coinbase and Binance. 
Revolut Continues Crypto Push With New Platform
Interestingly, with a user base of over 40 million, Revolut is one of the world’s largest fintech companies. The new platform will reportedly enable traders to buy and sell over 100 tokens, with fees ranging from zero to 0.09%. 
This announcement follows the launch of Revolut Ramp in March. Through a partnership with MetaMask, Revolut Ramp allows investors to purchase crypto directly within their wallets.

Leonid Bashlykov, the head of crypto exchange products at Revolut, emphasized the company’s goal of empowering customers to grow their wealth, whether in fiat or crypto. 
The profitability of the UK-based fintech company has been closely associated with the crypto market. During the previous bull run, the company achieved profitability for the first time in 2021. The high margins of crypto trading are expected to contribute significantly to Revolut’s profitability in the future.
Contrasting Retreat From US Market
Revolut’s foray into the UK crypto market coincides with recent regulations introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the country’s regulatory agency. 
These regulations include mandatory “24-hour cooling-off” periods that require investors to wait a full day before completing crypto transactions. While these barriers present challenges for smaller or offshore companies, they are manageable for established players like Revolut, according to Boaz Sobrado, a London fintech analyst. Sobrado explained:
These barriers to entry are unsurmountable for smaller or offshore companies, but achievable for companies like Revolut and Kraken. This means there are less competitors around, and hence a larger opportunity.
The firm’s renewed focus on crypto also reflects the positive outlook of the broader market. Since the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US on January 11, which have accumulated over $53 billion in assets, Bitcoin’s price has risen by over 40%. 
Moreover, the entry of financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity into the crypto space has accelerated market growth by expanding access to a broader pool of investors compared to previous cycles.

It is worth noting that the launch of the crypto exchange services in the UK contrasts with the company’s retreat from the US market. 
In August 2023, Revolut discontinued its crypto trading services for US customers, citing an unclear regulatory landscape and uncertain market conditions. However, this decision only affected a small portion, approximately 1%, of its user base.

Ethena's Bullish Pump | Bankless


Exchange Integrations. Many crypto tokens are finding themselves in the red, but Ethena’s ENA has managed to defy the trend, up nearly 10% to start the week! What is causing ENA’s outperformance, and is the catalyst sustainable? The ENA/BTC pair established its local bottom this Sunday, the same day Ethena’s Head of Growth tweeted this upcoming week would be big.Traders front-running the announcement sent ENA rallying against both BTC and the dollar throughout Monday before the token ripped higher early Tuesday morning to hit $1 for the first time in May on the news that its USDe synthetic dollar will be integrated with Bybit, the fourth-largest exchange by futures trading volumes in the month of April.
The partnership will enable spot USDe trading pairs and allow Bybit users to post USDe as perpetuals trading collateral, enabling them to access greater capital efficiency by offsetting a large portion of their funding payments. Additionally, users will be able to supercharge yields by supplying USDe to Bybit earn products.Should Bybit’s implementation of USDe prove to be a differentiating competitive advantage for traders, it is likely that additional exchanges will embed the synthetic dollar within their own products, providing massive tailwinds for USDe adoption and positioning it to finally compete in the big kids pool with USDT and USDC.
For Ethena to succeed, the demand for long leverage must remain high to keep funding rates elevated, as this is the source from which the Project generates the majority of its yield. Alternatively, compression in funding rates decreases the returns holders can earn, and Ethena incurs a loss when rates go negative.While high bull market-driven funding rates were supportive for USDe adoption in early 2024, the token’s supply has been down-only since April 13 when crypto markets slipped into a downtrend.Continued compression in funding rate markets is beginning to suggest that the mania is over for the moment, and although USDe exchange integrations can help bolster demand for the token, they will be unable to save the product should returns drift further downwards.Will BTC Follow TradFi Gains? on BanklessBTC could be headed for new ATHs if it can build off of TradFi’s rally.

The FCC’s Net Neutrality Ruling Is Good News for Web3 Startups

This principle has made possible a long list of home-grown internet applications that live at the endpoints and run on the network. Many, like YouTube and Netflix, or Zoom and Facetime, are core components of American (and global) social and work life. Without net neutrality regulations, network providers could have stopped Zoom or Facetime from ever coming into being, favor their own services over any potential new entrants, and pick and choose who they compete with, if you can even call that competition.

                        Football superstar Christiano Ronaldo was denied on May 4 his motion to dismiss a $1 billion class action lawsuit concerning his promotion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Binance.According to Newsweek, Judge Roy Altman issued his ruling, stating, “We deny without prejudice the Defendant’s 29 motion to dismiss.”
Ronaldo Stuck With $1 Billion Lawsuit
“Accordingly, we direct the Clerk of Court to close and stay this case until we have adjudicated the pending motions to compel arbitration in the related action,” the judge added. Arbitration is a private form of dispute resolution in which a final decision on the case is left to a neutral, mutually accepted third party rather than going to court.Investors sued Ronaldo in November 2023, one year after the athlete launched an NFT collection called “CR7” in November 2022 in collaboration with Binance.The collection’s name represents Ronaldo’s Initials and shirt number, which he often uses to brand his products. It features digital collectibles of himself and moments from his sports career and purports to stand for “innovation, artistry, and the unparalleled thrill of fan engagement,” according to Binance’s website.Prosecutors alleged last year that his promotion of those NFTs was “deceptive and unlawful,” however, leading them to costly and unsafe investment decisions. Since early 2022, Ethereum-based NFT mints and trading volume have dropped alongside floor prices.
Ronaldo’s Promotions For Binance
Some of Ronaldo’s promotional activities included posts on his Instagram account, including one in March where he played foosball with another athlete sponsored by the exchange.“Had an amazing time with @binance, creating the next level of fan experience,” he wrote in January. “Thanks to my ForeverCR7 NFT collection, I got to meet and train with the holders of my rarest NFTs.”In the November lawsuit, plaintiffs asserted that Binance had only reached the heights of its “fraud” thanks to its sale of unregistered securities, which was enabled and bolstered by numerous celebrities like Ronaldo. Binance is currently fighting U.S. regulators in court as to whether the NFTs and tokens on its platform constitute investment contracts under U.S. securities law.Plaintiffs argued that Ronaldo’s promotional efforts sent Google searches for the keyword “Binance” up 500% upon his announcement of his partnership with the exchange. His premium NFTs sold out within one week of launch.

SHIB Scores New Listing, Prompting 5% Surge in Fresh Wallets - DailyCoin


        
The Swiss-headquartered institutional crypto exchange Nexo listed Shiba Inu.



Nexo’s representatives recognized SHIB as a symbol of communal strength.



SHIB’s new registered wallets grow further, totaling 1.31M active addresses.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) received a substantial adoption boost on May 7, as institutional crypto heavyweight Nexo affirmed the meme coin’s listing on their all-in-one platform. 
Nexo, the renowned digital assets institution, posted a backstory of the iconic Shiba Inu mascot and SHIB’s emergence over the years. Back in 2021, CEO Antoni Trenchev labeled SHIB an “inside joke,” elaborating that “as it goes viral, the number of people in on the joke can go into millions, pushing the valuations out of this universe.”Since then, SHIB’s status has improved, bringing a new set of features directed at the growing Shiba Inu community, popularly known as the SHIB Army. In recent years, SHIB developers launched the Layer-2 blockchain Shibarium, a digital identity mechanism slated to introduce the community to Top-Level Domains (TLDs) and other perks.SHIB’s Bullish Wave Picked Up by New HoldersAs Nexo mentioned in their introductory tweet, Shiba Inu’s decentralized crypto exchange (DEX) ShibaSwap was the first step in providing real utility to the Shiba Inu community.Shiba Inu’s collectible card game Shiba Eternity quickly topped other popular games like Uno and Solitaire on the App Store and Google Play during their initial release in 2022. Alongside a base of dedicated veteran supporters, SHIB is enjoying a renaissance in new wallets, according to the latest on-chain data by IntoTheBlock.With a 5.07% hike in newly registered wallets and a 6.15% upswing in active crypto wallets, SHIB’s price performance since last week has also borne fruit in 6.6% gains. However, the upward trajectory depends on various macroeconomic factors, Shiba Inu burning efforts, and new projects being brought onto Shibarium’s Layer-2 chain.On the Flipside
An evolving feud between community members on X has sparked controversy among the SHIB Army. Shibburn’s official burn tracker’s official X handle posted allegations that Shytoshi Kusama and the developer team have “no control or say in the SHIB token,” even though both parties agree that SHIB is decentralized.
Why This MattersShiba Inu’s popularity has grown over the years to the point that SHIB Army is arguably the largest meme coin community in the cryptosphere.

Ethereum Is No Longer ‘Ultrasound Money’ After Dencun Upgrade: Analysts - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsEthereum’s latest upgrade may have worked a bit too well, bringing unwelcome consequences for long-term Ethereum (ETH) investors.As advertised, the Dencun hard fork slashed transaction fees by over 90% on multiple Ethereum layer-2 networks shortly after going live on March 13. the median Ethereum transaction fee today is up to four times lower than before Dencun when comparing periods of similar network activity, according to market intelligence platform CryptoQuant.With users paying less in fees, however, the Ethereum network is now burning the circulating ETH supply at its slowest rate since the Merge in September 2022. In fact, the burn rate is now so low that ETH has returned to being an inflationary currency, regularly issuing more units than are burned in a given period.“We conclude that, at the current rate of network activity, Ethereum will not be deflationary again, and the narrative of ‘ultrasound’ money has probably died or would need much higher network activity to come back to life,” CryptoQuant analysts in a weekly research report on Wednesday.“Ultrasound money” became a popular nickname for Ethereum after the Merge, which changed the consensus mechanism for the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap from proof of work to proof of stake. The upgrade also cut the issuance rate of new ETH by 90%, bringing it below the amount that the network burned through fees.Ethereum faithful eagerly used that fact to needle Bitcoiners, who have proudly championed Bitcoin (BTC) as “sound money” thanks to its fixed supply of 21 million coins. Theoretically, Ether was now superior “ultrasound money” with an actively decreasing supply, making it a better long-term store of value.But with ETH’s inflation rate back above zero, that argument is gone—and a revival in network activity may still fail to bring it back. As CryptoQuant noted, fees burned on Ethereum were positively correlated with network activity up until Dencun, after which they fell like a rock.According to the open-source dashboard ultrasound.money, Ether’s current inflation rate is 0.559% per year—still higher than Bitcoin’s 0.835% rate following last month’s halving.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Grayscale's Ether Futures ETF Application Pulled, Reason Not Disclosed


																A proposal to list and trade shares of prominent asset manager Grayscale’s Ether futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been withdrawn, as per a new document filed on Tuesday.
The filing by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that the application for the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust ETF, filed by NYSE Arca, Inc. in September last year, was withdrawn on May 3.
Previously, the agency had delayed consideration of Grayscale’s ether futures ETF, with the most recent postponement occurring in March.
However, the SEC had approved a batch of ether futures ETFs in October 2023, including those from ProShares, VanEck, and Bitwise.
Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart was the first to point out the development. Initially, Seyffart believed that Grayscale had a strategic plan to use its ether futures ETF to influence the securities regulator into approving its spot ETH ETF.




He found it puzzling that Grayscale withdrew its application, particularly with the SEC scheduled to decide on at least one spot ether ETF application on May 23, just over two weeks away.
Seyffart, along with fellow analyst Eric Balchunas, had previously estimated a 25% chance of approval for spot ether ETFs in May, a decrease from 70% in January.
Even with Grayscale’s withdrawal, Seyffart now sees the company as having no alternatives if the SEC doesn’t approve its spot ether ETF.
“If you don’t want to piss off the SEC. Withdrawing and re-filing is less work for the SEC. But at same time it means there’s no way for Grayscale or anyone to sue now.”
However, comments from SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a May 7 CNBC interview suggest that the SEC is still deliberating on spot Ether ETF applications.

White Pepe (WHPEPE) Will Surge 6,900% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

White Pepe (WHPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



White Pepe (WHPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 6,900% in price in the coming days.




This is because WHPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, White Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and White Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy White Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for White Pepe by entering its contract address – 58kSp6Sn8P42EdRDgud75YcvkRLnCpMxPb7MqCRHkUeG – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like WHPEPE.

UK's FCA Seeks Balanced Crypto Regulation by Merging TradFi and DeFi Approaches



                    

The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) aims to strike a balance in regulating cryptocurrencies by merging the best elements of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). 



This approach is to ensure neither over-regulation nor under-regulation disrupts the growing crypto market. 




Matthew Long, the FCA’s director of payments and digital assets, emphasizes the necessity of this strategy for effective regulation during his speech at the FT Crypto and Digital Assets Summit on May 8.



Long stated, “What we’re trying to do is take the best of traditional finance and understand the nuance of the system that we’ve got.” 



He elaborates that the regulatory framework should mirror the existing structures in traditional finance but adapt to the unique challenges of cryptocurrencies. 




This includes recognizing the global nature of the crypto market which necessitates a responsive regulatory approach.



“The simplest and most straightforward answer is that they [FCA] are trying to take the best of traditional finance, so it’s the same risk, same regulation and not reinvent the wheel,” Long noted, adding: “But we must and we absolutely must respond to the differences in cross border globalization otherwise. So to be frank, it’s a bit of both.”

During his discussion, Long pointed out that some regulatory aspects previously considered straightforward by the FCA turned out to be complex, and vice versa, indicating a learning curve in adapting regulatory measures to crypto-specific issues.




Moreover, Long highlighted the existence of risks in both centralized (CeFi) and decentralized finance sectors, stressing that tools for combating issues like money laundering in CeFi could be tailored for the crypto environment. 



This is part of a broader FCA initiative to foster a “cleaner, safer, and better” crypto market.



The UK’s increasing involvement in the cryptocurrency space is evidenced by the FCA’s recent activities. Since 2020, the authority has approved 38 out of 300 applications from crypto firms, reflecting its proactive stance in regulating the sector. 



Additionally, the FCA has enhanced its capabilities in monitoring and preventing market abuse and illegal crypto advertising. 



This underscores the UK’s commitment to establishing a regulated yet thriving crypto economy.

U.S. House Poised to Vote on Erasing SEC Crypto Policy While President Biden Vows Veto

"Gary Gensler, in his jihad against digital assets, used what is supposed to be mundane staff accounting guidance to essentially freeze out large publicly traded banks from taking custody of digital assets," said Rep. Mike Flood (R-Neb.), the effort's sponsor, in a Wednesday interview with CoinDesk. And the SEC didn't consult with the banking regulators about it, Flood pointed out, arguing that Gensler "doesn't have any business in the banking world."

Cryptocurrency Billionaire Andrei Grachev Rumored to Buy This Altcoin - Bitcoin Sistemi


Andrei Grachev, founder and CEO of controversial market-making firm DWF Labs, may be about to buy a hefty chunk of the altcoin, according to information provided by cryptocurrency data provider Spot on Chain.
According to the data, 0x3a2, a cryptocurrency wallet that previously sold Prom (PROM) to Grachev, purchased another 112 thousand PROM, equivalent to $1.12 million, through Binance. According to the data, this purchase was made at an average price of $9.95.

President Biden says he would veto resolution countermanding SEC crypto rule

United States President Joe Biden’s office has issued a statement informing lawmakers and the public that his administration plans to veto a joint resolution affecting crypto policy at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if it comes to his desk.In a May 8 statement, the White House said it “strongly opposes” members of the House of Representatives seeking to pass a joint resolution it claims would disrupt the SEC’s efforts “to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.” H.J.Res. 109, introduced in the House in February, would overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121, which requires banks to keep customers’ digital assets on its balance sheets, with capital maintained against them.“SAB 121 was issued in response to demonstrated technological, legal, and regulatory risks that have caused substantial losses to consumers,” said the Biden administration. “By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, it could also inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate guardrails and address future issues related to crypto-assets including financial stability. Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto-assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty.”Source: White HouseDemocratic and Republican leaders from the House Financial Services Committee took to the House floor on May 8 to express their views on the resolution. Representative Patrick Henry, a Republican, urged lawmakers to support H.J.Res. 109, claiming that SAB 121 allowed the SEC “to dictate how financial institutions and firms safeguard Americans’ digital assets.”“If you want Americans to be able to engage with digital assets safely and securely, banks — which are some of the most regulated businesses in our country — are probably the best way,” said Representative McHenry.Related: Big banks are nudging the SEC for a slice of sweet Bitcoin ETF actionRepresentative Maxine Waters, a Democrat and ranking member of the House committee, opposed the joint resolution, claiming that the SEC accounting rule allowed for greater transparency in the digital asset space. She reiterated claims in the SEC guidance that the rule was intended to address “unique risks and uncertainties” associated with cryptocurrencies and called McHenry’s efforts “harmful” and “partisan.”“This kind of transparency helps prevent the kind of fraud and mishandling of crypto assets that led to the collapse of major crypto companies like FTX,” said Representative Waters. After consideration in the House in which H.J.Res. 109 appeared to pass by a voice vote, Representative McHenry called for a count of the yeas and nays. The House chair postponed proceedings on the resolution “until a time to be announced.” Under the U.S. Constitution, the House could override President Biden’s veto with a two-thirds majority vote. Magazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime

11 Crypto ICOs That Can Mint Millionaires in Q3 2024



                    

The entire crypto community has anticipated the year 2024 for a long time. This anticipation resulted from perks attached to the year—Bull run, BTC halving, ICOs, etc.



Whenever the bull run starts, tons of novel projects kick, as they want to be a part of the ecosystem’s success. The majority of them launch their ICOs just so that they can onboard investors early, who will, in return, enjoy the benefits after the project launches.




These ICOs allow investors to buy a project token at a meager price compared to the launch price. After launch, some ICOs will enable investors to access all their funds. In contrast, others give a certain percentage upon launch, provide some months for cliffing, and then the remaining is shared in percentage over a period of months stated in their tokenomics.



Irrespective of the strategy used, the goal is to see all projects succeed. Nonetheless, as much as there are many good players, bad players also show forth their ugly heads. They present a false project, over-promise their investor to gather funds, and run away with the money overnight. This indicates that it is essential to research before jumping on any ICO to ensure investment is done at the right place.



In this article, we’ll consider the top 11 ICOs that can mint millionaires in Q3. From the product these projects offer to their roadmap and industry partnership, it has been established that these are vital factors to consider before making a decision.

Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF) Will Explode 9,000%, as it Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Solana Slerf (SOLSLERF), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Solana Slerf presents a similar opportunity.



Solana Slerf has market cap below $10,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 9,000% in the coming two days, and Solana Slerf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Solana Slerf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Solana Slerf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Solana Slerf by entering its contract address – D2R7sKwPNpWGtEfMJiLVe5G2ZJbExnk98PEft2dhyCrL – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SOLSLERF.

Solana Surge: Here’s Why This Analyst Is Predicting A Rise To $360


                            Recently, a popular crypto trader and YouTuber has predicted a substantial surge in Solana price, forecasting it could reach as high as $360 soon.
This prediction is underpinned by a technical pattern on Solana’s chart—a bullish signal suggesting a potential reversal from bearish to bullish momentum.

Technical Insights Into SOL Potential $360 Rise
According to the trader, CryptoJack on X,  SOL has developed a “rounding bottom pattern” over an extended period, indicating it is on the brink of a significant breakout.
Notably, the ’rounding bottom’ pattern, characterized by a gradual decline followed by a stabilizing trend and an upward breakout, is a classic bullish indicator in technical analysis.
CryptoJack’s analysis points out that Solana is setting up for a significant uptick, aiming for a price target double its current value of approximately $146.

Not only does CryptoJack see a bright future for Solana, but other analysts, such as Altcoin Sherpa, also maintain a bullish stance, with projections of the token potentially surpassing $500 this year.
This would represent a 300% increase from its current level, adding to the 589% growth it has already achieved year-to-date.
Solana Challenges Ethereum
While Solana has shown notable growth, some of its key metrics are also beginning to keep up the pace. Dan Smith, a senior research analyst at Blockworks, suggests that Solana could soon surpass Ethereum regarding transaction fees and capture Maximal Extractable Value (MEV).
Smith’s analysis of X highlights that Solana’s total economic value is nearing Ethereum’s, indicating its increasing relevance in the blockchain space.

Despite this competition, Ethereum maintains a significant lead in daily transaction fees and total value locked (TVL). In the last 24 hours, Ethereum generated over $2.75 million in fees, compared to Solana’s $1.49 million.

Moreover, according to data from DeFillama, Ethereum’s TVL of over $53 billion dwarfs Solana’s $3.96 billion, representing just about 7.2% of Ethereum’s scale.

Meanwhile, Ethereum does not come close to Solana in terms of market performance. Solana has seen quite outstanding growth in the past year, surging by over 500%. On the other hand, Ethereum has only seen a 66% surge over the same period.

XRP Price To Reach $1.68? Here’s What Will Drive It | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst Jonathan Carter has predicted that the XRP price could rise to $1.68. The analyst, however, noted what needs to happen before the crypto token can attain such heights. 
How XRP Price Will Rise To $1.68
Carter noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the XRP price was “bouncing from the lower trendline of a symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart.” He claimed that a successful breakout above the triangle would signal a bullish outlook for the crypto token, with $0.93 and $1.68 mi-term targets if this happens.

Like the broader crypto market, XRP is also experiencing a downtrend, and Carter’s prediction undoubtedly offers hope that the crypto token will soon see a trend reversal. Crypto analyst XRP Captain also seems to hold this belief, as he recently shared an X post in which he stated that an XRP breakout was on the horizon.
Like Jonathan Carter, XRP Captain highlighted a symmetrical triangle on XRP’s chart. However, XRP Captain seemed to have a much higher price target for XRP, with the analyst hinting that XRP could rise above $2.6. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Jaydee agreed with this prediction and replied to XRP Captain’s post, stating, “It’s coming! Glad we loaded up heavily at 0.44 and 0.50! Zero emotions!”
Jaydee had earlier made a prediction of his own, stating that XRP will make “life-changing gains for the 5% (smart money) once we bounce off the 7-year trendline.” In the accompanying chart he shared, the analyst highlighted a hidden bullish divergence that had formed for the crypto token.
XRP’s Road To Double Digits
Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto recently predicted that the XRP price could rise to double digits soon. He claims that there is “a mini pump to $1.5 and major pump to $5.89 in the cards.” According to him, this macro pump could be so parabolic that it will cause XRP’s price to soar above double digits.

Analyzing the charts, Egrag noted two ways XRP’s parabolic rise could happen. He claims that if XRP’s price action follows the white triangle, the crypto token will break out to the upside, possibly rising to $1.5 during this rally. He added that this will begin a “significant macro breakout” that coincides around Fib 0.786.
Meanwhile, XRP moving along the blue triangle could propel the crypto token to $5.89, coinciding around Fib 1.618, Egrag remarked.
According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP is trading at around $0.51 at the time of writing, down over 2% in the last 24 hours.

Tether Boosts Investment in Eastern Europe, Partners with Georgian Crypto Payment Provider CityPay.io



                    

Stablecoin powerhouse Tether is boosting its investments in Eastern Europe’s cryptocurrency scene through additional funding for the Georgia-based crypto payment provider CityPay.io. 



This development was formally announced on May 8, marking a significant step in CityPay.io’s growth and operational scale.




Tether’s investment into CityPay.io isn’t the company’s first; it follows a prior investment made in 2023 when Tether became one of the first stablecoin firms to back the payment platform. 



This platform enables users to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to pay for services at various locations, including Wendy’s and Radisson Hotels.



The latest round of investment aims to enhance CityPay.io’s penetration into the Eastern European markets, with a particular focus on countries like Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. 



As of May 2024, CityPay.io has established over 600 service points in Georgia alone. 



The company has ambitious plans to broaden its services to include e-wallet and card solutions within the next two years and is aiming to set up more than 500,000 cryptocurrency payment points across the planned expansion areas.



“Our previous collaboration with CityPay.io yielded exciting results in expanding convenient cryptocurrency use across Georgia,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, emphasizing the positive outcomes of their initial partnership. 



He further stated, “With this second investment, we aim to build on those results and drive the adoption of cutting-edge technologies that disrupt traditional payment systems.”

CityPay.io also marked a significant step towards integrating Tether as a payment option on the Polygon network in October 2023. 




Additionally, meetings with governmental bodies in Georgia were conducted by CEO Ardoino in September 2023 to discuss expansion plans.



Moreover, Tether has been actively collaborating with the Georgian government since signing a memorandum of understanding in June 2023. 



This agreement focuses on developing Bitcoin and peer-to-peer payment infrastructures within Georgia, signaling a robust governmental support for cryptocurrency initiatives.



Georgia’s emergence as a crypto-friendly hub is evident with its welcoming of major cryptocurrency firms like Binance and hosting a significant number of Bitcoin ATMs. 



CoinATMRadar indicates that Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, alone hosts 132 Bitcoin ATMs, highlighting the country’s advanced cryptocurrency infrastructure and its global aspirations in the digital finance arena.

Core Scientific sees revenue surge in 1Q24 after emerging from bankruptcy

Bitcoin miner firm Core Scientific posted improved financial results for the first quarter since emerging from bankruptcy. The company reported a total revenue of $179.3 million, marking an increase of $58.6 million over the same period in 2023.Net income for the quarter reached $210.7 million, an increase from the net loss of $0.4 million reported for the first quarter of 2023. This rise in net income was primarily driven by gains from obligations totaling $143.8 million and a decrease in Chapter 11 financing expenses, said the company.Revenue from digital asset mining reached $150 million, while hosting revenue contributed $29.3 million, according to Core Scientific. Digital asset mining revenue in excess of mining costs stood at $68.4 million, reflecting a 46% gross margin — compared to $25.4 million and a 26% gross margin in the same period of the previous year. The overall revenue from mining increased due to higher Bitcoin prices and Core’s mining capacity. According to the company, mining revenue was driven by a 134% increase in the price of Bitcoin and a 20% increase in the company’s self-mining hash rate, which offset a 34% reduction in the amount of Bitcoin received due to a 73% rise in the global hash rate.Hosting revenue in excess of hosting costs was $9.3 million, representing a 32% gross margin, compared to $6.4 million and a 28% gross margin in the first quarter of the previous year. The higher hosting revenue was primarily attributed to onboarding new digital asset mining clients, which drove a $6.7 million increase in hosting revenue. Operating expenses for the quarter totaled $16.9 million, down from $24.2 million in the same period last year. “We now believe our infrastructure is well positioned to take advantage of the enormous demand for power and infrastructure required for high-performance computing, and we see this as the next major growth opportunity for our business,” said Core Scientific’s CEO Adam Sullivan during an earnings call. During the fiscal first quarter of 2024, Core Scientific produced 2,825 self-mined Bitcoin, reportedly more than any other publicly listed miner in North America. The company owns approximately 745 megawatts of infrastructure that generated a total hash rate of 25.5 EH/s, comprising 19.3 EH/s from self-mining and 6.2 EH/s from hosting operations during the quarter.Core Scientific mined a total of 2,825 Bitcoin in 1Q24. Source: Core ScientificFollowing the Bitcoin halving event — which cuts miners’ revenue by half — Core is planning strategic mining equipment purchases at lower prices. According to Sullivan:“We are waiting to make countercyclical miner purchases to take advantage of improved pricing. After the recent halving, we are already seeing that dynamic take shape, with post-purchase pricing lower than pre-purchase.”Core Scientific received court approval to emerge from bankruptcy and relist its shares on the Nasdaq on Jan. 16, putting an end to a 13-month restructuring process.

US House of Representatives Meets to Abolish Important Crypto-Hostile Rule Critical to the Fate of Cryptocurrencies - Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

In a recent development, the US House of Representatives engaged in an hour-long debate on House Joint Resolution 109. The decision aims to rescind the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Accounting Bulletin Statement (SAB) 121, a rule with significant implications for the banking and cryptocurrency industries.
SAB 121 requires banks to disclose all cryptocurrency holdings, keep customer cryptocurrency assets on their balance sheets, and maintain an offset obligation. In other words, for every dollar of cryptocurrency held in escrow, the bank must hold an equivalent amount.


Originally adopted as guidance, SAB 121 was later adopted as a rule by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). This decision sparked controversy among banking regulators, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, who has a different approach to crypto custody.
In response to GAO's decision, a Joint Resolution bill was introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis, Representative Mike Flood, and Representative Wiley Nickel to repeal SAB 121.





Democrats, led by Maxine Waters, have advocated keeping the disclosure rules in SAB 121 but introducing a separate bill to change how cryptocurrency custody transactions work. They believe that repealing SAB 121 would weaken the SEC's authority and ability to issue new guidance on cryptocurrency in the future.

Maxine Waters announced that President Biden had conveyed his intention to veto the Joint Resolution if it reached his desk and emphasized the administration's commitment to keeping SAB 121 in place.


Despite opposition from the majority of Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee, Republicans argued that without changing the rule, the US risks smuggling cryptocurrencies overseas. They believe that decisions on such matters should be left not to the SEC, but to prudential banking regulators such as the FED, FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), and OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency).
Representatives Flood and Nickel expressed concerns about the risk of centralization of Bitcoin, the asset that backs Bitcoin ETFs. They pointed out that large companies such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Bitwise cannot hold custody with banks, which leads to high centralization in Coinbase.





While the discussions continue, all eyes are on the vote to be held this weekend. While the resolution is likely to pass on a bipartisan basis in the House, it is expected to face challenges in the Senate. Moreover, the White House has signaled its intention to veto any attempt to overturn SAB 121.

With various cryptocurrencies exhibiting significant movements, Ethereum Classic, Tron and Kaspa have recently sparked investor interest due to their price action and recent developments, leading some analysts to tout them as the best crypto to buy now.
                        As blue-chip cryptocurrencies trade with a bearish bias on Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) is sliding back to $ 62,000 after it found resistance at its 50DMA earlier this week. With a stagnant market outlook for larger cap coins, traders are parsing through the altcoins markets to look for the best crypto to buy today that might deliver a quick upside.At current levels around $62,500, Bitcoin is down close to 5% from its Monday high of $65,500.The cryptocurrency is still up over 10% compared to last week’s lows, however.Short-term macro headwinds eased last week following weaker-than-expected US jobs data, easing fears about an overly hawkish Fed.Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows also returned, though they have since petered out once again.The near-term Bitcoin price outlook looks very much tilted to consolidation within recent ranges.With Fed rate cuts still some way off and ETF flows not providing much momentum, Bitcoin lacks short-term price narratives.Consolidation in the coming months would fit Bitcoin’s typical 4-6 months post-halving and summer seasonality.That said, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook is as strong as ever.The blockchain’s hash rate, or computing power, has strengthened four-fold since Bitcoin was at its current price level in 2021.If Bitcoin can nudge back above its 50DMA in the coming weeks, that could be a buy signal, according to an analysis by Bitcoin Archive, which calls it a “mega-bullish” occasion.With Bitcoin on course to challenge $100,000 this year or next, it’s potentially the best crypto to buy today.But for investors looking for a bigger upside than Bitcoin’s potential 2x, altcoins might be more attractive.Here are some of Wednesday’s top-performing altcoins that might be the best crypto to buy today.
Best Crypto to Buy TodayEthereum Classic (ETC)
Ethereum Classic (ETC), the token of the original, non-forked Ethereum blockchain, is outperforming its sister on Wednesday.It was last up 5% in 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap, and trading near $28.ETC broke below its 2024 uptrend last month. But after briefly reaching as lows as $23, it is mounting a comeback.If it can break to the north of the $28-29 resistance area, where its 50DMA also resides, that could signal that the bulls have regained control.As hype and FOMO in the market build and investors become more irrational, ETC could reclaim these peaks, making it a good candidate for the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewEthereum Classic is a highly speculative play. It doesn’t have a fraction of the adoption of Ethereum. As per DefiLlama, Ethereum has a TVL of $133 billion, while Ethereum Classic has barely $600,000.But ETC did pump as high as $175 in 2021 – up 6.5x compared to current levels.As hype and FOMO in the market build and investors become more irrational, ETC could reclaim these peaks, making it a good candidate for the best crypto to buy now.
Tron (TRX)
The price of Tron (TRX) rose rapidly on Wednesday, increasing close to 3% despite the falling market.Having broken to the north of its 21 and 50DMAs, TRX is eyeing a break above key resistance at $0.1250.If it can surpass here, a swift move higher towards yearly highs around $0.1450 is possible.Tron could be the best crypto buy today if it can break to the north of this key resistance level. Source: TradingViewThe prospect of quick 20% potential gains makes TRX one of the best crypto to buy today.
Kaspa (KAS)
The outlook for Kaspa (KAS) just took a major turn for the better, with KAS pumping as a result.As per CoinMarketCap, KAS price has increased by 9% in the past 24 hours and is trading around $0.123.The door could now be open to a quick return to its yearly highs at $0.19.The door could now open to a quick return to its yearly highs at $0.19, making KAS the best crypto to buy today. Source: TradingViewThe prospect of a near-term 50% upside makes KAS potentially one of the best cryptos to buy today.
Crypto Alternatives to Consider
While the above coins offer the potential to return up to 5x this bull market, many investors will be hunting even stronger near-term gains.These investors can consider an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy – getting involved in crypto presales.A presale is when an upcoming web3 protocol sells its native token at an early-bird discount to fund development.Presales are risky, as projects can fail to deliver. But if they deliver, the upside can be huge – 100x or more.If investors can reliably identify high-potential presales, they can make a great return.With so many presales vying for investor funds, knowing where to start can be daunting.That’s why the team at Cryptonews.com has compiled a list of what they deem to be the best crypto presales.See the 20 Crypto Presales

SEC Wants More Than Just a 'Slap On the Wrist' Against Ripple - Decrypt

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission says that the penalty that Ripple is willing to pay after a long drawn out legal battle would be a “slap on the wrist that neither punishes nor deters” wrongdoing.The regulator argued in a Tuesday filing that its initial $2 billion demand would be more appropriate than the nearly $10 million fine Ripple proposed last month. The SEC said that Ripple’s offer would not deter other cryptocurrency businesses from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act, which requires issuers to file a registration statement when publicly offering securities.“Given the nearly $1 billion Ripple gained violating Section 5 [and] the multi-billion-dollar business it built selling XRP—accounting for the value of Ripple’s massive XRP holdings and its cash on hand—the ‘low’ penalty Ripple demands would be a ‘slap on the wrist’ that neither punishes nor deters,” the filing said. “To the contrary, it would encourage other crypto asset issuers to violate Section 5 by making it a remarkably lucrative endeavor, and thus deprive investors the disclosures Congress mandates, as a mere ‘cost of doing business,’” it continued.Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty on Tuesday slammed the regulator in a post on Twitter. “More of the same from the SEC—failing to faithfully apply the law and trying to pull the wool over the Judge’s eyes,” he wrote. Ripple—whose founders were behind the seventh biggest cryptocurrency XRP—has been locked in a legal battle with the SEC for years. Back in 2020, the regulator hit the fintech company with a $1.3 billion lawsuit, alleging that it sold unregistered securities in the form of XRP.But last year, Ripple scored a partial court win against the SEC when a judge ruled that programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors did not qualify as securities.The ruling sent shockwaves through the industry—particularly as Wall Street’s biggest regulator faces ongoing criticism from politicians and the crypto industry for cracking down unfairly on the digital asset industry. However, the judge also said that $728 million worth of contracts for institutional sales did constitute unregistered securities sales. The SEC is seeking a $2 billion fine for that violation as a result.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Nigeria claims Binance's bribery allegations are 'blackmail'

The Nigerian government has refuted bribery allegations made by crypto exchange Binance, which were described as baseless and an attempt to distract from the company’s legal challenges in the country, according to a press statement released on May 8.Binance CEO Richard Teng recently alleged that Nigerian officials demanded $150 million in crypto to settle an ongoing criminal investigation against the company.However, Rabiu Ibrahim, Special Assistant to the Minister of Information and National Orientation, dismissed the allegations as “diversionary tactics” and “blackmail.”Serious offensesThe Nigerian government said Binance is being probed for serious offenses, including money laundering, terrorism financing, and manipulating foreign exchange through illegal trading.It further highlighted that another Binance executive escaped custody and is now considered a fugitive with an international arrest warrant issued by Interpol.The government reiterated its commitment to following lawful processes and urged Binance to respect judicial proceedings rather than engaging in public relations maneuvers.The statement concluded by emphasizing that the Nigerian government will not succumb to any form of blackmail from any entity, whether local or foreign.Execs arrestedAmid the bribery allegations, Teng has also called attention to the detention of Tigran Gambaryan, a US citizen and Binance’s head of financial crime compliance, who was apprehended upon his arrival in Abuja on Feb. 26.Teng condemned Gambaryan’s detention as a tactic to control Binance, stating that the executive was in Nigeria as a “functional expert” rather than a negotiator or decision-maker.This controversy arises as Nigeria intensifies its regulatory measures against crypto trading to protect its currency, the Naira, from manipulation.Over recent months, the Nigerian government has directed telecommunications providers to restrict local crypto users’ access to trading platforms such as Binance and OctaFX. Additionally, authorities have accused the crypto exchange Binance of enabling trades worth billions, further exacerbating the strain on the Naira.The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission also recently announced plans to remove the Naira from peer-to-peer trading platforms as part of a broader crackdown on crypto trading, which has been blamed for adding volatility to the foreign exchange market.Mentioned in this article

                        As Shiba Inu (SHIB) threatens a bearish breakout of a key technical pattern, investors are moving their attention to a new ICO as they target 1000% returns that they are unlikely to get with SHIB.SHIB has formed a pennant structure in the past two months as it continued to consolidate below its 2024 highs.Though pennant structures can break in either a bullish or bearish direction, SHIB risks seem tilted towards fresh downside.That’s because SHIB has found strong resistance twice in the last few weeks at its 50DMA.That suggests that the bears remain in control of this market.If SHIB does break below its current pennant structure, as well as below its 100DMA, sell pressure could surge.The first bearish target would be the support zone at $0.000018. The next target would be the late 2024 highs and early 2023 highs in the $0.000015-16 area.Shiba Inu Investors Move to New ICO, Targeting 1000% Returns / Source: TradingViewWith SHIB likely to drop in the near term, investors are looking for alternatives that might offer quick upside.One new ICO called 5thScape has caught the attention of analysts at Cryptonews.
5thScape – Is This New ICO 2024’s Best Opportunity?
Exciting new ICO 5thScape has been generating a lot of hype recently.5thScape is a first-of-its-kind crypto-powered VR/AR project.

Optimism will roll out new features to support layer 3 on Superchain - Crypto Briefing




Optimism is set to release two new features to facilitate the integration of layer 3 (L3) builders into its Superchain network. The upcoming features, custom gas tokens, and Plasma Mode, are designed to streamline the onboarding process for L3s utilizing the OP Stack and to foster a collaborative environment within the Optimism ecosystem.According to Optimism’s blog post, projects looking to build an L3 solution can use their existing layer 2 (L2) token for gas fees. Optimism expects this feature to simplify the transition for communities from L2 to L3 and reduce onboarding costs for new users.“- rather than needing to onramp by performing an expensive L1 transaction depositing gas tokens into the L2, on-ramping to an L3 can be as simple as performing a cheap L2 deposit transaction into the L3,” Optimism stated.The deployment of custom gas tokens is in the final stages and is expected to be available soon, the team noted.With Plasma Mode, Optimism wants to offer an alternative data availability (DA) layer option, which is essential for developers looking to launch cost-effective chains.By only requiring transactions to be submitted to L2 rather than the Ethereum Mainnet, the costs associated with data commitments and output roots are significantly reduced. This reduction in fixed overhead costs makes L3s a more accessible option for deployment on the OP Stack.“Low overhead costs give L3 teams an even more accessible option for deploying on the OP Stack.” Optimism added.The team claims that the recent launch of Redstone, the first OP Stack Chain with Plasma Mode, exemplifies the potential of this feature to enable high-throughput applications without the need for new programming languages. Optimism continues to develop Plasma Mode to integrate multiple DA layers and anticipates that L3s will extensively experiment with this feature.Optimism’s vision for Superchain is to create a chain network that shares an open-source tech stack and contributes revenue to the Optimism Collective. L3s are now invited to join this expanding network, with the promise of access to a broad network of builders, eligibility for various funding opportunities, and the ability to shape the future of scalability within the Superchain ecosystem.The latest developments are part of Optimism’s ongoing effort to meet the growing demand for flexible and customizable technology within the Optimism ecosystem. They also demonstrate the company’s commitment to making blockchain technology more accessible to a wider range of developers and consumers.“As the Optimism ecosystem grows, so does the demand for flexible, customizable tech. Scalability is about making blockchain technology more accessible to more builders and consumers. If developers can build scalable applications, they can reach more users without excessively increasing their costs or needing to multiply their resources,” Optimism stated.

Bitcoin Price Prediction as $1B Liquidity Fund Launched for Hong Kong Crypto ETFs - Will Asia Lead the Next Bull Market?


Bitcoin Price Prediction

Bitcoin’s pivot point is set at $62,500, which Bitcoin has recently undercut, suggesting a bearish bitcoin price prediction. Immediate support at $59,164 provides the next threshold that could see significant buying interest if tested. Further supports are placed at $56,677 and $54,336, levels that might come into play if the downtrend continues.
On the resistance side, Bitcoin faces several barriers. The immediate resistance is at $64,564, beyond which the next levels are $67,084 and $69,356. These figures represent critical points that Bitcoin would need to surpass to confirm any potential bullish reversal.
Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: Tradingview
Technical indicators offer additional insights into Bitcoin’s market position. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 63, indicating a slightly bullish momentum, although it’s nearing overbought territory.
The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), at approximately $62,585, aligns closely with the pivot point, reinforcing it as a significant resistance level. The EMA’s position above the current price suggests that we could see continued resistance around this area.
Conclusion: The current market setup for BTC/USD shows a bearish trend below the $62,500 pivot point. Should prices continue to hover below this mark, it might catalyze further drops towards the $59,164 support or lower. Conversely, a break above the pivot could signal a shift to a more bullish outlook, potentially driving prices towards higher resistance levels at $64,564 and beyond.

3 trends to think about before crypto's bull run resumes

Cryptocurrency’s next bull run has already begun. One of the most significant differences compared to past cycles lies in the type of new investors entering the market. Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) effectively opened the door for wider participation by making it easier to get a piece of the action, and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs are widely expected to arrive soon.Newcomers may have some difficulty understanding crypto, but there is a worthwhile framework to be considered in light of their first investments.Beginners often start by investing in the big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum. For the most part, you can invest in Bitcoin and wait at least six months before checking its price to see if it's grown enough to sell. But for those with only a few thousand dollars to invest, investing in Bitcoin isn’t going to make you a millionaire. The near to mid-term growth potential is 2-3 times its current value.Related: The Runes protocol will ignite a new season for Bitcoin after the halvingExperienced players understand that they need to check the latest trends. If done right, investing in a dozen small projects could really pay off. Assets that proved popular in the previous bull run, like new layer-1 protocols and lending platforms, might offer a chance to grow your investment by five to 10 times.However, risk and return are two sides of the same coin. How much one is willing to gain or lose in crypto really boils down to the time, resources, and energy one is ready to put into studying the market. That’s where the beauty of crypto lies: for those willing to learn, it's perfectly accessible.There are three narratives that the average new user without any impressive experience behind him comprehend and qualifiedly believe. The key is to figure out the story behind each product. Innovation stands at the forefront of this space because people in crypto are innovative and constantly looking for something new. I see three such trends for the bull run.Will Bitcoin really peak at the end of 2025? Source: XFirst is the marriage of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. A large number of projects are now trying to innovate at the intersection of blockchain and AI. While it's not guaranteed that these efforts will have fruitful outcomes, the narrative itself is strong. This trend, riding the wave of both blockchain's potential and AI's cutting-edge advancements, could capture the imagination of investors and enthusiasts alike. I’m following RitualNet and Morpheus.The second trend delves into more fundamental aspects related to the tokenization of real assets or the tokenization of debt. In a traditional market, the debt market is larger than the stock market. Yet, in the crypto realm, there is currently no debt market. Stablecoin can be considered its starting point, since companies issue stablecoin in exchange for real dollars and then themselves buy short-term U.S. bonds. However, the concept of corporate debt remains untouched within crypto. Therefore, everything related to debt tokenization has enormous potential. PV01 and Ondo Finance are two projects in this area.Related: Solana illustrates the dark side of monolithic blockchainsThe third trend focuses on enhancing blockchain technology itself — improving its efficiency, increasing throughput, and lowering operational costs. It uses new tech like parallel Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) to process many things at once, speeding up transactions. Likewise, zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs keep things private but simple, making the whole system work smoother and cost less. Sei and Monad are projects to watch in this area.But how can we use these narratives to delve into the product? Imagine an investor who studies a product. He is interested, maybe even excited about a project. Every time he encounters something incomprehensible in the document, he highlights it in red. Then he looks at the whole description and sees that there is too much red in the document: there is too much he does not understand about the product description. And he doesn't invest. This is a straightforward strategy: if an investment is too complex to understand, it might not be the right one. This approach emphasizes the need for clarity. So, when you're thinking about investing in a trend, remember that the big funds have probably already made a move. If there is some kind of noticeable narrative, then they will most likely have already invested in it. This is a good reminder to stay informed - understanding that, in the world of investment, it’s the giants who often lead the game.Ruslan Fakhrutdinov is the CEO and founder of X10, a self-custodial crypto exchange based in London.

FTX Pens Plan Promising 118% Cash Back to Creditors - DailyCoin


        
FTX has unearthed billions of dollars to pay back customers. 



The exchange’s bankruptcy estate has proposed a new Chapter plan. 



FTX claimants could receive more than what they are owed. 
FTX’s wild goose chase with its creditors is finally drawing to a close as the now-defunct crypto exchange appears more confident in filling SBF’s $10 billion hole. In a surprising and positive development for claimants, the exchange’s bankruptcy estate has now devised a plan that would pay creditors more than they’re owed– in cash.FTX Unearths Billions to Pay Back CustomersFailed crypto exchange FTX has found billions of dollars more than required to cover the losses users incurred during the SBF-led fiasco in November 2022. Surprisingly, the exchange is set to fully reimburse users plus interest—a rare sight in US bankruptcy proceedings. 
“In any bankruptcy, this is just an unbelievable result,” said FTX CEO John Ray.FTX’s newfound confidence stems from its recent efforts to liquidate assets, including its mountain loads of Solana, shares in successful startups like Anthropic, and its extensive list of illicitly acquired estates. With as much as $16.3 billion in cash at its disposal for distribution, 50% more than it owes, FTX appears well-equipped to settle its debts, totaling around $11 billion to two million customers and other creditors.The exchange’s bankruptcy estate is now confident in reimbursing 98% of its creditors for 118% in claims– in cash. FTX Proposes New Chapter 11 PlanOn Tuesday evening, FTX announced an amended Chapter 11 plan to pay claimants more than they’re owed. 
Announcing the new proposal, FTX’s CEO shared, “We are pleased to be in a position to propose a Chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors.”Creditors with allowed claims below $50,000 will be eligible for the 118% compensation pending court approval, as outlined in the plan. According to a recent court filing, FTX’s proposal is slated to distribute the claims within 60 days of court approval.FTX’s new restructuring plan aims for a “centralized distribution” among its customers, regardless of where their assets are located. The plan also seeks to leave no crumbs for shareholders. Court documents detailed that although all debts will be paid in full, plus interest, nothing will be left for equity holders.This is primarily because US regulators and the IRS are bidding their time and waiting for FTX to repay its customers. Once the debts are cleared, regulators will likely wipe out shareholders’ claims.FTX’s major equity holders include Sequoia Capital, Thoma Bravo, Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, according to a court filing last year. The defunct exchange’s resurgence comes on the heels of the crypto market’s rebound from the bear market.FTX’s Bittersweet Conundrum Bitcoin at press time hovered above $60,000, reaching a new all-time high earlier this year, while Solana, a significant part of FTX’s holdings, comfortably sits above $140 and has climbed up to the top five rankings as one of the year’s top performers.The market’s resurgence has been a boon for FTX, especially considering the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy estate’s ability to repay customers, with initial projections suggesting only a 90% reimbursement.While FTX appears now more confident, the market’s recent performance presents a dilemma. The total crypto market cap has surged by 210% since November 2022. However, FTX’s restructuring plan will compensate victims based on the cash value of digital assets held on the exchange on November 11, 2022, the date of the bankruptcy—ignoring the accumulated gains over the past two years. FTX customers could potentially miss out on billions in gains due to the structure of the Chapter 11 plan. Although many users have contested the proposal, arguing it was unfair due to the crypto market healing, FTX attorney Andy Dietderich asserted that US bankruptcy was ‘very clear,’ stating:"I have no wiggle room on that. The Bankruptcy Code says what it says, and I am obligated to follow it."Still, given the market volatility, it is a positive development that claimants are at least receiving compensation. The recent market conditions could not have been accurately predicted when the Chapter 11 plan was proposed.On the FlipsideWhy This MattersFTX’s collapse had a very lasting impact on the crypto landscape. However, the new plan signals a positive development for the industry and the affected users. It brings them closer to receiving the compensation they were owed, even though they were given little hope earlier last year.Will Cardano and Bitcoin Cash collaborate?Cardano’s Hoskinson Gauges Bitcoin Cash Integration With PollBTC-e founder bites the dust for laundering billions:BTC-e Founder Admits $9B Money Laundering Conspiracy Charge.

House votes to nullify SEC’s anti-crypto banking guidance SAB 121

The United States House of Representatives has voted to pass a bill that overturns controversial Securities and Exchange Commission guidance preventing banks from owning crypto. President Joe Biden, however, previously warned earlier in the day that he would veto the new bill if it were to make it to his desk. On May 8, the House voted to pass a bipartisan bill dubbed H.J. Res 109 which overturns the SEC’s Special Accounting Bulletin (SAB 121) that requires banks to hold their customers’ crypto assets on their balance sheets — which is not the case for traditional assets such as securities. Republican Congressman Mike Flood — the lawmaker who introduced the resolution — said SAB 121 was unfair for banks looking to custody crypto, as custodial assets are “always considered off-balance sheet."Notably, 21 Democrats voted in favor of the bill — which combined with the unanimous 207 votes from Republicans — saw the bill pass 228 votes to 182. Source: Caitlin Long/XDespite the bill being passed through the House of Representatives, President Joe Biden stated he will veto the new bill.In a May 8 statement, the White House said it “strongly opposes” members of the House of Representatives looking to overturn SAB 121, claiming it would disrupt the SEC’s efforts “to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.”Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto-assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty.Source: White HouseIntroduced by the SEC in March 2022, SAB 121 outlines the regulator’s accounting guidelines for institutions looking to custody crypto assets. Notably, SAB 121 virtually prevents banks from custodying crypto assets on behalf of clients.U.S. lawmakers including SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce have argued SAB 121 jeopardizes the willingness of regulated banks to act as crypto custodians and treats crypto holdings differently than other assets."By overturning SAB 121, the bipartisan resolution ensures consumers are protected by removing roadblocks that prevent highly regulated financial institutions and firms from acting as custodians of digital assets," wrote the House Financial Services Committee (HSFC) in a May 8 statement. “Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 is one of the most glaring examples of the regulatory overreach that has defined Gary Gensler’s tenure at the SEC,” said HSFC Chairman Patrick McHenry.This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

AI Tokens Take The Baton From Memecoins To Lead A Market Resurgence ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
After last week’s bloodbath, cryptocurrency prices began climbing northwards again, this time on the backs of projects linked to artificial intelligence (AI).



The price resurgence sees AI-themed tokens record the largest gains over one week, with leading tokens easily racking double digits. AI-based RNDR spiked by over 40% on the seven-day charts to be the biggest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.



Placed side by side with other niches, other AI-themed tokens were no match for the broader market. Fetch.ai (FET) climbed by 23% in a week to erase previous losses, while Bittensor (TAO) and SingularityNet (AGIX) basked in double-digit gains as well.



For comparison, Bitcoin could only manage a sub-4% gain over the same period, while Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) barely recorded gains of 1%.



A bird’ s-eye view of the broader financial markets offers some insights into the AI-backed resurgence of cryptocurrencies. Following the upcoming release of company financials, experts predict AI chip manufacturer Nvidia will post impressive results for Q1, with one analyst eyeing earnings of $5.49 per share.

&nbsp



“There is a strong buzz around Nvidia’s impending earnings,” said one analyst. “AI coins will keep having cyclical runs as they are directly correlated with the whole AI-side development happening around us.”



The AI ecosystem has been buzzing with activity since the tail end of 2022, accentuated by the launch of several AI models by leading industry players. OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Anthropic have emerged as frontrunners for the space while others are turning to blockchain for their AI offerings.



A cross-section of analysts expect the AI craze to continue for the foreseeable future, buoyed by the injection of fresh capital into the design and commercial rollout of powerful AI models.



“OpenAI will launch a new model in the coming months, better hardware will be developed, and more funds will be injected into the space,” said DYOR founder Hitesh Malviya. “We are in an AI super cycle right now.”



Memecoins may be running out of steam



In Q1, memecoins hogged the spotlight with impressive returns for investors but recent on-chain data points to a flippening. While Dogecoin (DOGE) appears headed to 20% gains over the course of a week, other memecoins have not had a rosy climb in recent days.



Shiba Inu (SHIB) is down nearly 4% over the last 24 hours while Pepe (PEPE) suffered a 6.19% slip in the same time frame. Solana-based dogwifhat (WIF) appears to be the biggest loser with losses cantering toward 12% over the last day with analysts opining that investors may be paying close attention to the utility of tokens.

Biden Vows to Kill Bill to Retract SEC Crypto Banking Policy - Decrypt

Just as the U.S. House of Representatives approved a resolution demanding that the Securities and Exchange Commission roll back its anti-crypto banking policies, the White House preemptively declared that it will be vetoed if passed.The resolution to overturn a 2022 SEC bulletin passed with bipartisan support, 228-182, on Wednesday, earning praise from crypto advocates within and outside Capitol Hill.”With the disapproval resolution, the House is taking a stand to ensure that such significant changes go through the proper public rulemaking process,” said Amanda Russo, director of communications of the Crypto Council for Innovation, in a statement shared with Decrypt. ”This is vital for maintaining a competitive and innovative financial landscape.”The impact of the vote was blunted, however, by a statement issued by the Biden administration hours before.“The administration strongly opposes passage of H.J. Res. 109, which would disrupt the SEC's work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system,” it read. “Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto-assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty.”If the resolution made it to President Joe Biden's desk, the statement concluded, he would veto it.The focus of the dispute is a normally uncontroversial Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) issued in April 2022. “The obligations associated with these arrangements involve unique risks and uncertainties not present in arrangements to safeguard assets that are not crypto-assets, including technological, legal, and regulatory risks and uncertainties,” the bulletin read.“Traditionally, staff accounting bulletins are not designed to enact sweeping policy changes—they are meant to clarify existing rules,” Russo said. “SAB 121, however, acts as a new rule, impacting core aspects of the financial and digital asset industries.”Rep. Mike Flood (R-Nebraska) introduced a resolution in the House condemning SAB 121, while a companion resolution was introduced in the Senate.“It is unfortunate that the SEC would attempt to circumvent the rulemaking process while falsely claiming that SAB 121 is simply non-binding staff-level guidance,” Flood said on Monday.Longtime SEC critic Rep. Tom Emmer expressed strong support for the House resolution today.This resolution is an essential effort to protect consumers and foster innovation in digital assets markets,” he said. “It's also critical to stop the SEC's regulatory power grabs.”“SAB 121 introduces more unnecessary and avoidable concentration risk into the digital asset ecosystem, making our markets less fair, less orderly, and less efficient,” Emmer had said earlier this week, adding on Twitter that SEC chair Gary Gensler is violating his agency's statutory mission.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

UK Moves to Regulate Staking and Stablecoins


The UK is on the brink of passing significant regulations concerning staking and stablecoins, aiming to cement its position as a global hub for cryptocurrency. 
This legislative push is being spearheaded by Economic Secretary Bim Afolami, who recently emphasized the urgency and priority of these regulations at the Financial Times Crypto and Digital Asset Summit.
UK’s Staking and Stablecoin Regulations 
Afolami expressed confidence in the government’s ability to implement the necessary legislation around these key areas of the crypto market. 

Stablecoins offer a semblance of stability that is not commonly found in the volatile crypto market. Additionally, staking provides a mechanism for cryptocurrency holders to earn rewards by participating in network operations. 

“What I’m very confident we’ll be able to achieve is the secondary legislation around staking and stablecoins. Those two things are absolute priorities in the coming weeks and months,” Afolami said.


The Conservative Party, currently holding the reins of the government, is keen on these regulatory advancements. Despite recent electoral setbacks where they witnessed seat losses to the Labour Party, the Conservatives are pushing forward with their crypto regulatory agenda.

Still, the political climate has uncertainties. The recent shift in local power dynamics could influence the legislative process, especially with the general elections looming. The need to act worsens due to these political pressures and the global financial impact on the UK’s regulatory stance.
As Afolami noted, the imminent regulations enhance market stability and provide clear, structured guidelines that could attract more business to the UK’s crypto sector. This move will reinforce and bolster investor confidence by ensuring a secure, transparent, and stable regulatory environment.

XRP on the Verge of Breakout? Analyst Points to Key Pattern to Suggest Surge of Over 200% | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger, has been on a turbulent journey in recent years. After a meteoric rise to nearly $2 in April 2021, XRP has been in a slump, leaving investors questioning its potential for recovery as it’s now trading at $0.52 while BTC is at $62,000. However, a recent analysis by market analyst Jonathan Carter suggests that XRP might be on the cusp of a significant upswing.



The cryptocurrency strategist shared his analysis on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), pointing to a symmetrical triangle on the cryptocurrency’s weekly chart, from which XRP could soon break out of.



The price of XRP has been trapped within this triangle for several years, reflecting a potential tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. A successful breakout, Carter said, would see XRP move upward significantly.







A recent price dip in April, mirroring a broader market correction, saw XRP retest the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle. In technical analysis, such a retest is often viewed as a potential precursor to a breakout, where the price decisively breaches one of the trendlines, and the rest was interpreted as a potential signal for a breakout.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Should a breakout from the symmetrical triangle materialize, Carter projects an initial surge towards $0.93, a level XRP briefly touched in July 2023 following a positive development in the ongoing legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 



However, Carter believes XRP will surpass this resistance level and reach a more ambitious mid-term target of $1.68, representing a staggering increase of over 200% from its current price level.

Despite the bullish analysis,  the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile, and unforeseen events can significantly impact price movements. Additionally, the lingering SEC lawsuit, which centers around XRP’s classification as a security, continues to cloud the token’s future.



A negative outcome in the lawsuit could dampen investor sentiment and derail any potential price surge. Nevertheless, other analysts remain bullish, with Egrag Crypto recently saying a potential surge to the $4 mark is “feasible.”

Ethereum (ETH) on Verge of Fall, XRP Death Cross Solidifies, Solana (SOL) Breakout Could Be Fake

Ethereum is currently on the edge of a significant price drop. As of the latest charts, Ethereum is trading close to the $3,000 mark, a critical psychological barrier. This precarious position signals a potential fall toward $2,950, an event watched closely by market observers.The trading volume, while subsiding, hints that this potential dip could be temporary. However, the stability of Ethereum's price largely hinges on its ability to maintain support at $2,961. The fall below this level would cause a more pronounced drop to around $2,780. This scenario is not just a minor fluctuation; it points to larger issues at play within the Ethereum trading environment. ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewThe overall situation on the Ethereum chart does not inspire much confidence at the moment. One of the more concerning signs is the possible convergence of moving averages. This event typically indicates upcoming volatility, suggesting that the market could be gearing up for significant price movements. Such volatility can sometimes lead to a bullish breakthrough, although in the current climate, such an outcome is not guaranteed.XRP faced deathXRP is currently facing a "death cross." This occurs when the shorter-term 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crosses below the longer-term 200-day EMA, a classic bearish indicator in trading circles. For XRP, this pattern is not just a theoretical concern but a visible sign on the charts, indicating that the downtrend could intensify.The formation of the death cross on XRP's chart suggests that the current downtrend could worsen. There is a looming possibility that XRP could fall toward $0.50, or potentially even lower. This technical setup is crucial for traders as it often precedes further declines in price, reflecting bearish sentiment among investors.However, it is not all doom and gloom. There is a notable trendline support around the $0.51 mark. If this support holds, it could prevent further immediate losses and offer some respite to holders. But with current trading volumes remaining low, the downward pressure on XRP's price remains a concern. Low volume often means less market activity, which can make the price more susceptible to sharp moves on relatively small trades.Looking ahead, traders and investors will be keenly watching for a potential reversal of this trend. A "golden cross," which occurs when the 50-day EMA crosses above the 200-day EMA, would be a bullish signal and could indicate that the value of XRP is set to increase. Such a cross is renowned for signaling the start of a significant upward rally in asset values.Solana's fakeoutSOL appeared poised for gains, but its failure to breach the 50-day Exponential Moving Average and subsequent reversal has raised suspicions of a false breakout.Typically, a genuine breakout is supported by strong trading volume and a decisive crossing of key technical levels such as moving averages. For Solana, however, the volume has been on the decline, contradicting the initial upward price movement. This lack of volume support is a red flag, suggesting that the breakout might not have the momentum to sustain itself.Adding to the concerns is SOL's inability to hold above the $150 price level. It quickly reversed back toward lower prices, indicating that the market might not be ready for a sustained upward trend. This behavior is often indicative of a "fakeout," where the price briefly breaks out of a key resistance or support level only to revert back into its previous range.The convergence of moving averages could potentially introduce some volatility, offering a glimmer of hope for an uptick. However, current market conditions do not favor a robust recovery. Solana has recently dipped below the trendline that previously acted as resistance, and it now faces a critical support level at $140, which aligns with the 100-day EMA.For any significant recovery to appear on the chart, it would require a broader market rally, which seems unlikely at the moment. The overall crypto market is experiencing a correction, and without a positive shift in sentiment and market dynamics, Solana's chances of a strong rebound are close to nonexistent.

Robinhood Q1 crypto trading surges 224% - SEC action ‘disappointing’

Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev described the recent Securities and Exchange Commission Wells notice as a “disappointing development” during a Q1 earnings call, as the firm posted a 224% increase in crypto trading volumes in the quarter to $36 billion. Robinhood’s crypto-related services contributed to nearly 40% of its transaction-based revenue of $329 million, helping the firm record its second straight profitable quarter with a net income of $157 million.But the strong quarter earnings results come in light of a Wells notice handed to the firm by the United States securities regulator last week, which targets Robinhood’s crypto listings and custodian operations.Tenev said the news was a “disappointing development.” Its chief financial officer, Jason Warnick, stressed the firm has adopted a conservative approach toward its coin listings and services and holds its crypto business to the same legal and compliance standards as its brokerage business.“So it’s disappointing to see more regulation by enforcement here.”The Robinhood executives however stressed that customer accounts aren't impacted by the development."We're going to defend the firm and continue to advocate for our customers," Tenev added.Aside from the dilemma, Robinhood’s first quarter performance surpassed industry expectations, with its reported revenue of $618 million beating a $534.5 million estimate by investment research firm Zacks by 15.6%.Robinhood shares rallied as high as 7.3% to $19.15 in after-hours trading but has since cooled off to $18.55, according to Google Finance.HOOD’s change in share price on May 8.

Ethereum-Based Altcoin Leads Real-World Assets Sector in Development Activity, According to Santiment - The Daily Hodl


								Blockchain analytics platform Santiment says one Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoin project is leading in the real-world asset (RWA) sector based on development activity.
Santiment says that blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK) is seeing the greatest amount of daily activity on the development hosting platform GitHub.










LINK Is seeing more than two times the amount of development activity compared to the second most active blockchain project, Synthetix (SNX), a decentralized finance (DeFi) crypto that allows synthetic asset creation on Ethereum.
 “Here are crypto’s top real-world assets by development. This list is compiled by counting any non-redundant GitHub activity, and averaging this daily activity over the past 30 days. Chainlink currently produces 2.49x more daily activity than the next most active project, Synthetix, in the RWA sector.”
Santiment’s ranking list is as follows: 1. Chainlink 2. Synthetix.io 3. Centrifuge (CFG) 4. Dusk (DUSK) 5. Oraichain (ORAI) 6. Creditcoin (CTC) 7. IX Swap (IXS) 8. Maker (MKR) 9. Polymesh Network (POLYX) 10. Reserve Rights (RSR).

Santiment also says that the native asset of decentralized oracle protocol Tellor (TRB) is outperforming most other digital assets so far this month.
“Tellor is one of the top performing assets thus far in May, exactly doubling in market cap since the calendar month turned. Whale transactions and address activity have both seen sudden spikes, which are suggesting potential TRB profit takes.”

Tellor is trading for $111.64 at time of writing, up 16% in the last 24 hours.

JPMorgan Onyx CEO Criticizes Public Blockchains for Large Transactions



                    

In a recent discussion at the BIS Innovation Summit on May 7, JPMorgan‘s Onyx blockchain-based payment platform CEO, Umar Farooq, highlighted the inadequacies of public blockchains for managing large transactions. 



He stated, “I think you almost need something like [a Unified Ledger]. I mean, it’s actually almost a necessity because if you look at […] public blockchain ledgers, they are not fit for purpose for large transactions today.”




Farooq’s comments were in response to the Unified Ledger, a concept introduced by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) aimed at facilitating central bank money flows, tokenized deposits, and digital assets on its network.



He elaborated on the risks associated with public blockchains, pointing out the lack of accountability in cases where substantial transactions fail. 



“Who do I sue? […] You need to get somewhere where people can do trusted transactions between financial institutions with some sort of accountability in the system,” Farooq emphasized.




Despite criticizing public blockchains, Farooq leads a platform that operates as a private, permissioned version of Ethereum, the second-largest public blockchain. 



This private chain variant allows for transaction reversals, differentiating it significantly from its public counterparts.



Additionally, Farooq critiqued the incentive structures of cryptocurrencies on public blockchains, which he believes are designed to increase user numbers and thus the price of the coins.

He suggested that blockchains should evolve to be seen more as a public good rather than mechanisms for financial gain: “We need to get to an evolution point where the technology starts to be seen as a public good versus as a means to enrich.”



In contrast to JPMorgan’s preference for private blockchain solutions, other traditional financial institutions seem to favor public blockchains for asset tokenization. 



Celisa Morin, former vice president of platform distribution at Grayscale, indicated that entities like BlackRock are increasingly interested in public blockchains for these purposes. 



Morin stated, “I think we see a preference for private chains with JPMorgan’s Onyx. But I do think that this was the narrative a few years back. Now, I think it’s very much the public blockchains.”



Highlighting the growth of public blockchain utilization, BlackRock’s $100 million tokenized “BUIDL” fund, launched on the Ethereum network on March 18, now holds over $382 million, making it the world’s largest tokenization fund, according to Dune data.

Twitter Touts ’Seamless‘ Blocking of Child Abuse Content as Elon Musk Faces Increased EU Scrutiny - Decrypt

Social media giant Twitter says a new system to prevent the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on its platform was “deployed seamlessly,” testing technology developed by the non-profit group Thorn.The Twitter Safety account announced on Tuesday that it participated in a beta test of the group's AI-powered Safer solution to proactively detect, delete, and report text-based material containing child sexual exploitation.“Through our ongoing partnership with Thorn, we’re doing more to create a safe platform,” the Twitter Safety account wrote. “This work builds on our relentless efforts to combat child sexual exploitation online, with the specific goal of expanding our capabilities in fighting high-harm content where a child is at imminent risk.”“This self-hosted solution was deployed seamlessly into our detection mechanisms, allowing us to hone in on high-risk accounts,” it continued.Launched in 2012 by actors Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, Thorn develops tools and resources focused on defending children from sexual abuse and exploitation. In April, Google, Meta, and OpenAI signed onto a pledge issued by Thorn and fellow non-profit organization All Tech is Human, vowing to enforce guardrails around their AI models.“We’ve learned a lot from our beta testing,” Thorn's VP of data science Rebecca Portnoff, told Decrypt. “While we knew going in that child sexual abuse manifests in all types of content, including text, we saw concretely in this beta testing how machine learning/AI for text can have real-life impact at scale.”As Portnoff explained, the Safer AI model comprises a language model trained on child safety-related texts and a classification system that generates multi-label predictions for text sequences. Prediction scores range from 0 to 1, indicating the model's confidence in the text's relevance to various child safety categories.While Portnoff could not disclose which other social media platforms were participating in the beta test of the Safer suite of products, she said the response from other companies has been positive.“Some partners shared that the model is particularly useful for identifying harmful child sexual abuse activity, prioritizing reported messages, and supporting investigations of known bad actors,” Portnoff said.Due to the proliferation of generative AI tools since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, internet watchdog groups like the UK-based Internet Watch Foundation have sounded the alarm about a flood of AI-generated child pornography circulating on dark web forums, saying the illicit material could overwhelm the internet.The announcement by the Twitter Safety team came hours before the European Union demanded that the company explain reports of “decreasing content moderation resources.”The latest transparency report that Twitter submitted to EU regulators said Elon Musk’s cost-cutting measures have reduced the size of the platform’s content moderation team by almost 20% since October 2023, and cut the number of languages monitored from 11 to 7.“The commission is also seeking further details on the risk assessments and mitigation measures linked to the impact of generative AI tools on electoral processes, dissemination of illegal content, and protection of fundamental rights,” the demand adds.The EU opened formal proceedings against Twitter in December 2023 over concerns that the company violated the Digital Services Act across several areas, including risk management, content moderation, “dark patterns,” and data access for researchers.The commission said Twitter must provide the requested information by May 17, and address additional questions by May 27.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.
