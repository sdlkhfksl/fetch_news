Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



International Game Technology PLC (NYSE: IGT) reported robust financial results for the first quarter of 2024, showcasing a revenue increase to $1.07 billion, a 1% rise from the previous year’s $1.06 billion. This growth was primarily driven by a significant uptick in Global Lottery sales, a 6% increase to $661 million. However, this was partially offset by a 7% decline in Gaming & Digital revenue, which fell to $406 million. The company’s operating income remained steady at $256 million, but excluding separation and divestiture costs, it reached a record $273 million, marking a 7% increase.



Operating income margin for the quarter was 24.0%, slightly above the prior year’s 24.1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $443 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 41.5%. When excluding separation and divestiture costs, adjusted EBITDA rose to $461 million, and the margin improved to 43.1%.



IGT Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1, Reports $1.07 Billion in Revenue



IGT’s performance in the first quarter exceeded market expectations. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.40 (and an adjusted EPS of $0.46), significantly higher than the anticipated $0.30. This remarkable improvement in EPS, a 264% increase from the $0.11 reported in the same period last year, was driven by a combination of strong operational performance and favorable foreign exchange gains. Analysts had projected revenue of $1.03 billion for the quarter, but IGT surpassed this with actual revenue of $1.07 billion, highlighting the company’s robust sales in the Global Lottery division.



Despite a decline in Gaming & Digital revenue, the segment’s operating income margin expanded by 80 basis points to 20%, thanks to process improvements in research and development and easing supply chain costs. The Global Lottery segment’s operating income rose by 8% to $258 million, driven by strong same-store sales in Italy and higher product sales margins. These results underscore IGT’s ability to outperform expectations through strategic initiatives and operational efficiencies.





IGT Upgrades Full Year 2024 Guidance



Given the strong performance in Q1 2024, IGT has upgraded its full-year outlook. For the second quarter of 2024, the company expects revenue of approximately $1.05 billion and an operating income margin of around 22%, or 24.5%, when excluding separation and divestiture costs. This guidance reflects continued confidence in the company’s ability to drive growth and profitability across its key business segments.



For 2024, IGT has set ambitious targets, projecting revenue of around $4.4 billion and an operating income margin of approximately 21%, or 24%, excluding separation and divestiture costs. The company also anticipates generating cash from operations of at least $1.0 billion and plans capital expenditures of roughly $500 million. This optimistic outlook is supported by broad-based momentum across key performance indicators and ongoing efforts to separate the Global Lottery business from Gaming & Digital.

Ethereum (ETH) Option Traders Are Expecting This Price for Ethereum at the End of June! - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to data from Deribit, the term structure of open interest in Ethereum options reveals a concentration in call contracts, consisting of more than 617,000 contracts expiring at the end of June with a face value exceeding $1.8 billion.
Ethereum Options Traders Predict $3,600 for June Expiration
This significant number of call contracts and their significant nominal value may reflect confidence in Ethereum's potential to gain value by the end of June.


Intensifying interest could also support the price of the digital asset if derivative investors choose to exercise their options when the price begins to exceed certain strike prices specified in the option spread.
According to CoinShares Research Associate Luke Nolan, strike prices for June expiry calls are concentrated above $3,600, with $6,500 being the most preferred strike price.






The analyst highlighted a significant notional value of $192 million associated with the largest open interest before June expiration at a strike price of $6,500, reflecting confidence among some investors in Ethereum's ability to reach or exceed that level.
“The largest open interest for the June expiration is concentrated at a strike price of $6,500 with a face value of $192 million,” Nolan said in a statement.


The data also shows that the number of outstanding calls has increased compared to open positions in Ethereum options ahead of the late June expiration.
A call options ratio below one indicates that the buying volume exceeds the selling volume and there is an upward trend in the market.





An investor who buys a call option is implicitly assumed to be in a bullish trend in the market, while an investor who buys a put option is assumed to be in a bearish trend.

Solana Meme Coin Devs Fight on Livestream to Pump Price-Until One Loses a Tooth - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe world's top boxers can make millions of dollars per fight. In a decidedly lower-stakes matchup, two Solana meme coin creators smacked each other around on a livestream early Monday, with dreams of their coin perhaps rising to hit a million-dollar market cap amid the viral buzz. Unfortunately, they were brought back to reality when a tooth went flying.Posted in the early hours of the morning, FriendlyFadesLive popped up on Pump.fun—the streamlined platform used to launch LiveMom, Shark Cat, and other meme-driven Solana tokens.It’s the latest instance of a growing trend of meme coins being driven by livestreamed stunts, such as the dev who tied his hands, oiled himself up, and slept on stream.To promote this particular token, FADELIVE, two young men faced off in balaclavas, wearing Everlast boxing gloves and sparring in a tiled dining room rather than a legit boxing ring.While Tyson Fury will be fighting Alexander Usyk to become undisputed heavyweight champion this weekend, this clash was billed by the devs as “two of the deadliest fighters battling it out to see who takes over Solana.”After only a couple minutes of livestreaming on Kick, the token was crowned king of the hill on Pump.fun—a featured spot on the site reserved for tokens that hit a $30,000 market cap, which often brings in new buyers as well thanks to the increased exposure.As a reward, viewers watched the two titans brawl in a one-handed fight. Despite being named “Friendly Fades,” it quickly became clear that they weren’t pulling any punches.For 20 seconds, the two amateur brawlers threw right hand after right hand. In this first fight, it appeared that the fighter in the red shorts got the better of his Nike gray tracksuit-wearing opponent—landing a clean straight shot that signaled the end of the round.“This shit about to hit Raydium?” said the dev who was now up on the scorecard, looking at his laptop. When a Pump.fun token reaches a market cap of $69,000, it can be listed on Raydium, a Solana decentralized exchange (DEX)—so the devs’ eyes were set on a new prize.“Pump it up, pump it up boys,” the gray tracksuit boxer cried.The chat filled with viewers demanding that they continue fighting. “You have 60 seconds ‘til I fucking withdraw my SOL,” one Kick viewer commented.“Stop talking, more fighting,” another said. “Last time you fought, it almost hit Raydium.” That was all the devs needed to hear. The men strapped their gloves up and began another 20-second round, this time with both hands in play. It was like watching Max Holloway in the last seconds of a fight, as both brawlers stood nose-to-nose and swung for the fences. Unfortunately, the round was cut short when red shorts’ unplugged his Xbox with poor footwork, after being backed into a corner.Going into the third round, it looked like a draw on the judges' scorecards. Someone had to pull themselves away from the pack. Red shorts dominated early on, landing a stiff jab followed by a strong right hook, and then a slapping left hook—an effective combination. Gray tracksuit was wobbled, defending for his life as red shorts left striking range. Still flustered, gray tracksuit threw some strikes, yet hit nothing but air. In the next flurry, red shorts landed a nasty three-piece combo that had his opponent backing off. He landed one last straight as gray tracksuit’s body language deflated.“You good? What happened?” the shorts-wearing man asked.“My tooth came out,” gray tracksuit replied, sounding slightly scared. The toothless fighter appears to walk out of the room, likely in search of a mirror. It sounds like it was one of his back teeth that fell victim to his friend’s vicious striking.“We need to go to the hospital,” he muttered, clearly affected by his sudden missing tooth.Amid laughs in chat, the boxers' morale appeared to change. Possible brain damage aside, the pair managed to amass only four viewers on Kick, and they didn’t even get their token to Raydium. It’s a reward that's far from the $150 million Tyson Fury is estimated to earn this weekend. It’s unknown whether the pair plan to fight again in the future. The Twitter and Kick livestream accounts associated with the token are still up, so perhaps there will be a rematch ahead. But for now, it appears that red shorts is the world boxing champion of Solana.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin's prices depend on this week's Fed events: What's going on? - AMBCrypto



Key events that could impact BTC’s price are coming up this week.
BTC has lost some gains from its previous trading session.

Bitcoin [BTC] has encountered volatile price movements in recent days, exemplified by a notable over 3% decline on the 10th of May, which drove its value down to $60,000. 
However, indications suggest that these choppy fluctuations may persist, largely influenced by the impending Federal Reserve meetings.
Bitcoin investors await BLS events outcomes
The upcoming events scheduled by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) this week are noteworthy for investors due to their potential impact on investment decisions. 
Historical data suggests that announcements from the Federal Reserve (Fed) have influenced Bitcoin prices in the past.
 Therefore, the upcoming speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, scheduled for the 14th of May, is particularly significant.
The BLS schedule indicates two key events: the Producer Price Index (PPI) today and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on the 15th of May.
 The PPI measures changes in prices received by producers for goods and services, while the CPI tracks changes in prices paid by consumers for those same goods and services.
 Both indices serve as vital economic indicators that investors rely on to gauge the state of the economy.
Additionally, the BLS website indicates an upcoming event focused on employment claims later in the week.
 These macroeconomic events are poised to influence Bitcoin price movements as investors closely monitor them to inform their investment strategies.
What to expect from Bitcoin price moves
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Bitcoin’s price trend on a daily timeframe chart indicated a sluggish performance over recent weeks.
 On the 10th of May, the price experienced a significant drop from over $63,000 to around $60,000, reflecting a loss of over 3%. 
While attempting to recover since the 11th of May, Bitcoin could only reach approximately $62,900. At the time of this writing, it was trading at around $62,000, with a decline of over 1%.
Source: TradingView
Examination of the stochastic indicator suggested the possibility of further decline, as a crossover was still ongoing. 
However, based on recent price action, the $60,000 level appears to serve as a strong support region. Should the price drop further, around $57,000 might act as another level of support to prevent further decline.
Possible rise in BTC volume expected
The volume metric for Bitcoin could experience increased activity if the price begins to decline. 
The chart revealed that during the previous trading session, when the Bitcoin price was rising, the volume was approximately $25 billion.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

However, at the time of writing, as the BTC price has dropped, the volume has already surged to nearly $28 billion. 
This uptick in volume suggests heightened trading activity, potentially indicating increased selling pressure if the price continues to fall.

Alibaba Group Misses EPS Expectations by $0.02 in Q1 2024 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA), a leading e-commerce and technology conglomerate, reported its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The company demonstrated moderate growth with revenue reaching RMB 221,874 million ($30,729 million), marking a 7% increase year-over-year. This growth was driven by the company’s China and international commerce businesses, which saw double-digit year-over-year GMV growth, and the accelerated growth of cloud computing revenues related to AI products.



Despite the revenue growth, Alibaba’s income from operations decreased by 3% year-over-year to RMB 14,765 million ($2,045 million). The company attributed this decrease to increased investments in its e-commerce businesses and retention incentives for Cainiao employees. Adjusted EBITA also saw a 5% decline, totaling RMB 23,969 million ($3,320 million). Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB 3,270 million ($453 million), a significant drop from the previous year, largely due to a net loss from investments in publicly-traded companies.



Alibaba Group Misses EPS Expectations in Q1 with $1.40 EPS



Alibaba’s performance in the March quarter of 2024 was a mixed bag when compared to market expectations. Analysts had projected earnings per share (EPS) of RMB 10.27 and revenue of RMB 220.32 billion. The actual revenue of RMB 221,874 million slightly exceeded expectations, showcasing the company’s ability to maintain growth in a competitive market. However, the company’s non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS came in at RMB 10.14 ($1.40), falling short of the expected EPS.



The discrepancy in earnings was primarily due to the company’s increased investments and the significant net loss from its equity investments, which impacted the bottom line. Net income for the quarter plummeted by 96% year-over-year to RMB 919 million ($127 million), highlighting the volatility in Alibaba’s investment portfolio. This stark decline overshadowed the revenue growth, raising concerns among investors about the sustainability of the company’s profitability in the short term.





Alibaba Group Repurchased $12.5 Billion of Shares During the Fiscal Year, Approved $4 Billion Dividend



Alibaba remains optimistic about its strategic priorities and future growth opportunities. CEO Eddie Wu emphasized the company’s commitment to enhancing customer experience and capturing growth in AI and cloud computing. The company expects strong revenue growth in public cloud and AI-related products to offset the decline in low-margin project-based revenues. This strategic shift is aimed at improving the overall profitability of



Alibaba’s cloud business saw a 3% year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter. Additionally, Alibaba’s board of directors approved a $4 billion dividend for fiscal year 2024, reflecting the company’s commitment to returning value to shareholders. The company also repurchased $12.5 billion of shares during the fiscal year, indicating strong confidence in its long-term prospects. These measures will likely bolster investor sentiment and cushion against short-term market fluctuations.



Strategic and Operational Updates



Regarding business segments, Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall Group reported a 4% year-over-year revenue growth to RMB 93,216 million ($12,910 million). The company achieved double-digit online GMV and order growth, driven by an increase in the number of purchasers and purchase frequency. The Cloud Intelligence Group recorded RMB 25,595 million ($3,545 million), with a strategic focus on high-quality revenues from public cloud adoption and AI products.



The Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group saw a robust 45% year-over-year revenue growth to RMB 27,448 million ($3,802 million), driven by its cross-border e-commerce initiatives. Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited also reported a 30% increase in revenue to RMB 24,557 million ($3,401 million), primarily due to cross-border fulfillment services. These segments underscore Alibaba’s diversified growth strategy and its efforts to enhance operational efficiency across various business units.



In conclusion, while Alibaba’s Q1 2024 performance showcased moderate revenue growth, the significant drop in net income and earnings per share highlighted the challenges posed by increased investments and volatile equity markets. However, the company’s strategic focus on AI, cloud computing, and international expansion, coupled with shareholder-friendly measures, positions it well for future growth and profitability.

                        DOGE has gained by 4% in the past 24 hours, with the Dogecoin price racing to $0.1504 after the return of GameStop trader ‘Roaring Kitty’ to X sent meme coins flying yesterday.Dogecoin is now up by 8.5% in a fortnight but down by 4.5% in a month, with the alt sitting on a 108% increase in the past year.The online return of Roaring Kitty – whose real name is Keith Gill – not only pushed GameStop’s stock up by close to 75% in a day, but has boosted various meme tokens, including DOGE, PEPE, WIF and Roaring Kitty (ROAR).The gains of such coins come on a day when the crypto market as a whole is down by 1%, suggesting that meme tokens may outperform averages in the near term.Dogecoin Price Prediction as DOGE Bounces 4.5% in a Day – What’s Causing the Pump?
DOGE’s chart is in a very promising position at the moment, with its indicators having perked up in the past day but still having room to intensify before we enter an overbought position.Most significantly, the coin’s 30-day average (orange) has just climbed over the 200-day (blue), forming a golden cross that often portends strong gains.Source: TradingViewThis has happened in the context of a rising relative strength index (purple), which touched 80 yesterday and remains in a promising position between 50 and 60.Given that the previous few days had seen a sustained loss, it’s likely that the Dogecoin price will continue to consolidate its recent gains in the near term.It’s also encouraging that DOGE’s 24-hour volume has shot up to $2 billion today, from $600 million barely 24 hours ago.This indicates some very strong interest, with DOGE outperforming most alts today, save for a handful of other meme tokens.As noted above, this is largely because ‘Roaring Kitty’ has posted online for the first time in three years, inviting speculation that he may begin trading again.Regardless of whether Gill actually begins another crusade, traders have pre-empted any possible pump by buying the likeliest meme tokens to benefit from his return.This includes DOGE, which, in the longer term, may end up benefiting massively from X’s introduction of digital payments.X has said it will introduce such payments this year, and if its options include crypto and DOGE, the latter could rocket.If not, it may reach $0.25 by the end of the summer and $0.4 by the end of the year.New Dogecoin Token Has Big Potential
While DOGE could continue to gain in the near term, it arguably doesn’t promise as much positive volatility as newer meme tokens, which can often outperform the market by big margins.While picking winners in advance is often a crap shoot with very new meme coins, one way of identifying stronger candidates is to look for successful presales.And one new meme coin with a very encouraging sale is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain meme coin that has raised over $15 million in its token offering.Source: DogeverseAs the first-ever Doge-themed multi-chain crypto, DOGEVERSE will run on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.By operating on multiple chains, it could gain much greater usage and traction that it would have as a single-chain coin, with the increased demand helping to push up its price.Helping with a higher price will be its max supply of 120 million tokens, which, over time, will potentially make the coin deflationary.Also, squeezing its supply will be the ability to stake the token, which will incentivize long-term holding on the part of owners.VIDEOWhile the coin’s presale will be ending soon, investors can still join its sale by going to the official Dogeverse website, where 1 DOGEVERSE is $0.00031.This is its final presale price, with DOGEVERSE unlikely to be available so cheaply ever again.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Ripple files motion to seal remedies documents in ongoing SEC legal battle

Ripple Lab Inc. has filed a motion to restrain the process related to the remedies stage of its ongoing legal case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The motion, put forward on May 13, 2024, asks the court to shield Ripple‘s proprietary information. Ripple has cited reasons why the disclosure of information publicly might hurt its business and competitive standing.Ripple seeks to seal remedies documentsXRP’s lawyers are asking the Court to seal documents regarding potential remedies and penalties that the XRP developers may face should the company be decided guilty in the SEC case. According to James Filan, a well-known defense lawyer, this is in an effort to keep confidential the company’s proprietary business information and strategic details. Ripple presents that revealing such documents could allow one’s competitors to gain an unfair advantage over it and harm one’s market position.The company states that the security of these documents is fundamental to protecting its business in the midst of legal proceedings. If the motion to seal is granted, these files will be sealed, and even the public will be allowed to see them if the court or parties to the case are involved in the reviewing process. The company believes that such a measure would be essential for Ripple’s business strategies and proprietary information.Ripple CFO supports motion to sealJonathan Bilich XRP, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), filed a testimony declaring his support for the motion to seal. Bilich highlights that by not moving forward with the resolution, XRP could face a core business rupture. He highlights the potential financial losses, the disruption in operations, the loss of market confidence, facing heavy regulation, and many more. According to Bench, such a motion will preserve Ripple’s stability and market position for the duration of legal proceedings.The motion regarding sealing has stirred up the mixed feelings of the financial and crypto communities. While transparency supporters want the public to serve as a check and balance for fairness and accountability, XRP proponents are convinced that the company may face aggressive competitors and, therefore, need to improve the secrecy of their data. This discussion, thus, strikes at the heart of the wider debate on the conflict between transparency and business confidentiality in high-end litigation.Ripple-SEC case key for crypto regulationIn December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple Labs, accusing it of selling XRP unlawfully through off-market, unregistered securities sales. According to the SEC, XRP is a security per federal securities rules, and Ripple regards this assertion with much contention. Ripple insists that XRP is not a security and has successfully repelled all the SEC’s charges against it.The decision, in this case, warrants deep consideration for regulating cryptocurrencies in the US. It could be a milestone in the development of the cryptocurrency sector by providing scenarios for the classification and regulation of digital currencies. XRP’s legal battle with the SEC is closely followed by players in the financial and crypto sector, as it may have a wide influence on the overall regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase Resumes Operations Following Four-Hour System Outage | Coinspeaker



The lack of a definitive explanation for the downtime led to speculation that it could have been due to server maintenance or system overload.

Coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency exchange based in the United States, has successfully restored its system back online after four long hours that seemed like an eternity to users. On May 14, Coinbase announced that it was hit by a major system outage that impacted its performance on both desktop and mobile devices.
In a social media post shared on X, the company described the incident as a “system-wide outage”, which resulted in the temporary unavailability of its services. The outage commenced at approximately 4:15 am UTC on Tuesday. However, after hours of locking users out of their accounts, the company’s support team announced on X that the services had been fully restored.






Coinbase Yet to Disclose Cause of System Outage
Initially, users attempting to visit the Coinbase website on desktop and mobile devices received a “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” error message.
While the company informed users about the “system-wide outage”, it did not include details of the exact cause of the downtime. Its support team took to X to notify users that the company had been unable to pinpoint the exact cause of the blackout while assuring users that their funds were safe.
The lack of a definitive explanation for the downtime led to speculation that it could have been due to server maintenance or system overload. According to a developer guide from Mozilla, overloading is one of the most common causes of such disruptions, which could have contributed to Coinbase issues.
Despite restoring the service back online, Coinbase has not disclosed the specific cause of the outage, leaving users and industry observers to speculate about the incident.
Not the First
Coinbase’s recent four-hour system outage is not an isolated incident for the publicly traded US-based company. Earlier this year, Coinbase was among several crypto exchanges that faced temporary blackouts in February.  The outages were triggered by a sudden surge in crypto trading activity during a Bitcoin (BTC) flash crash, which caused the asset’s price to plummet nearly 10% before recovering.
Coinbase also encountered another issue in March when some users reported difficulty accessing their accounts. The temporary glitch affected users’ ability to use the platform, with some traders even seeing a zero balance on their Coinbase accounts during the incident.
While outages can be frustrating for users of crypto exchanges, the experience is not limited to centralized platforms. Yesterday, Coinspeaker reported that Degen Chain, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, suffered a system outage that lasted more than 12 hours.
The outage led to temporal restriction of users’ access to other blockchain projects including bridges associated with the chain.
Last month, another blockchain protocol, Shibarium, a layer-2 network developed for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, suffered a system outage that affected the performance of  SHIB.

Equalizer DEX hacker drains funds: Users warned, investigation underway

A hacker began draining user funds on May 14 through the decentralized exchange (DEX) Equalizer. The misuse of funds only became apparent when the Equalizer team tweeted warning users to stop interacting with the exchange.So far, the hacker has drained around 2,353 Equalizer (EQUAL) and several other tokens from users. Though the value of the stolen tokens is low, the small transactions allowed the hacker to continue siphoning user funds under the radar.Source: EqualizerThe hacker’s  wallet address was established over 222 days ago and is continuing to receive the stolen user funds.The theft began with 2,500 SpookySwap liquidity tokens (spLP) being drained at around 4:10 am UTC on May 14, which led to many other tokens being taken from users.The total number of tokens drained so far include:As a result, EQUAL price is down almost 11% on the day to around $8.90.To add insult to injury, a scammer then created a fake Equalizer X account and posted how affected users could claim a refund.Source: Fake Equalizer account It is not yet clear whether all the tokens were drained through the Equalizer DEX, but the Equalizer team is currently still investigating the exploit. Through the Equalizer Discord channel, the team announced a preventative measure for users to take to stop further loss of funds:“If connecting to the dapp [[Connect Wallet]] asks you to Approve something, immediately Stop using that site. If the dapp asks you to interact with a contract you have never interacted with earlier, Stop using that site. If it asks you to approve any contract that is unknown or not in our docs, Stop using that site.”


Equalizer Discord member “543” informed the community that users are safe if they “did not interact with Equalizer Websites since 6 hours ago.” However, if users interacted with the websites in the last six hours, “543” requested that users “please revoke all your approvals made during this time.”Source: Equalizer Discord channelThe team is “working on restoring the main website” and has informed users to avoid using the main website until updated.

After years of quiet, Roaring Kitty gets loud


A small-time retail trader named Keith Gill — also known online as Roaring Kitty and DeepFuckingValue — who is famous for helping GameStop become the meme stock of the century around 2021 has reappeared on X (formerly Twitter) after years of silence.

Gill’s videos and live streams, which often advocated for investors to examine their own financial situation and take profit accordingly, were referenced in front of Congress, where he testified and stated, simply, “I like the stock.”
The influential tweeter made his return on Monday and since then has posted a dozen tweets, all videos, all suggestive memes.
Part of Gill’s testimony pointed out that GameStop retained value in its physical locations. Since then, over 200 locations have closed, according to a website that tracks the closing of GameStop locations.
Judging by Gill’s tweets, it appears as though he’s expressing some disappointment, either with how management has handled GameStop since the run-up in stock price, or how the entire financial system has reacted since the blowup of RobinHood in 2021.

Amazon-backed Anthropic brings Claude AI chatbot to European users

The artificial intelligence (AI) developer Anthropic announced that its AI chatbot Claude is now available in Europe for use by both individuals and businesses, according to a blog post. On May 14, the company said that its AI assistant is now accessible via its web application and iOS app with “strong levels of comprehension and fluency” in multiple European languages, including French, German, Spanish and Italian.


The development follows the launch of Claude 3, its most powerful system that can analyze images, in the United States in March 2024. Previously, to access the chatbot, Europeans could only do so by using a virtual private network (VPN). The announcement comes shortly after its launch of the Claude API in Europe earlier this year — a feature that allows developers to integrate Anthropic’s AI models into applications, websites, or services.Cointelegraph reached out to Anthropic for further information on its European release. Users on X have been commenting on Claude's emergence in Europe, noting that while ChatGPT still excels in reasoning, Claude is demonstrating superior eloquence in writing.While writing quality can be somewhat subjective, our European correspondent Savannah Fortis put Claude 3 to the test in a small head-to-head with ChatGPT. In both instances, the free version of the chatbots was used. Related: Mistral AI startup launches LLM to take on ChatGPT, Gemini and ClaudeWhen prompted to “write a short poem about Europe,” both chatbots incorporated key elements of multiple European countries as a part of the content of the poem. However, Claude’s writing quality stood out and was more accurate in providing a “short poem” with only a handful of stanzas. Claude’s poem was more coherent as a full story, whereas ChatGPT had nice rhymes on theme, though they sounded more like phrases put together rather than telling a story.

Over the last year it has secured investments from some of the biggest names in tech, including Amazon who committed an investment of up to $4 billion in September 2023 and a $2 billion commitment from Google the month after.On April 5, Anthropic launched a beta of its feature “tool use” for all Anthropic Message API users for the Claude suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models. This enables real-time information lookup, access and integration of third-party features into Claude’s workflow; allowing users to insert code snippets to their account to allow Claude to bring in outside information into conversations.

CFTC Warns Students and Job Seekers about Crypto Money Mule Scams | Coinspeaker



The CFTC says that young people, students and job seekers should be careful as unwitting money mules are still liable to criminal charges.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has warned young people, including students and remote job seekers, about scams that use unsuspecting job seekers as crypto money mules. In a release published Monday, the CFTC’s Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO) warns of the dangers of these scams, which help criminals to launder money.
CFTC Warns Job Seekers Warned About Become Money Mules
According to the OCEO, young people could end up in jail simply by associating with illicit activity. These money mule scams get people to use their crypto wallets, trading accounts, or other digital wallets to send and receive money or transfer funds from one person to another. Job seekers are sometimes easy targets because they may believe the requests are legitimate “secret shopper” or “payment processor” activities. OCEO Director Melanie Devoe stated:




“Young people looking for summer jobs may be just looking for part-time income and could be attracted to offers that require being online a few hours a day. Unfortunately, they could become unwitting accomplices to money laundering or what the criminals call ‘money mules,’ and that association could land them in jail.”
The OCEO writes that criminal organizations use networks of people to move illicit funds to evade law enforcement. These fund transfers and currency conversions seem legit as young people and job seekers usually think they are performing regular job duties. In other instances unrelated to job seeking, victims may believe they are helping a friend or doing a love interest a favor.
Unfortunately, according to the CFTC, “the consequences – often in the form of criminal charges – remain the same for witting and unwitting participants.”
In some cases, scammers may convince the victims to on-ramp cash to a blockchain. This involves using cash to buy crypto via a trading account, or even a Bitcoin kiosk, and then sending the crypto to a specified wallet. There is also off-ramping, which requires people to convert crypto tokens to fiat currency, essentially withdrawing the money from the blockchain.
Methods Used by Criminals
Cryptocurrency transfers are an easy way for criminals to move illicit funds under the radar. However, criminals are also aware that despite some anonymity in blockchain use, law enforcement agencies are getting better at tracing and confiscating illicit assets. Consequently, criminals get unsuspecting victims to help them off-ramp the money and then move the fiat from the victim’s bank account to another.
The OCEO’s release also highlights another common scam called “smurfing”. Using crypto, criminals send a large amount to an unsuspecting person’s wallet or trading account. The person is then expected to send small amounts to several wallet addresses.
The CFTC’s release is part of its participation in the Money Mule Initiative, an annual international movement to dismantle money laundering networks. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) reported that through this year’s campaign alone, law enforcement agencies have taken action against over 3,000 money mules. The agencies have also brought charges against 24 individuals.

AI-powered social engineering not technical exploits now dominating 90% of cyber attacks

A newly published cyber threat report from Avast has revealed substantial dominance of social engineering in cyber threats during the first quarter of 2024. Per the report, nearly 90% of cyberattacks on mobile and 87% on desktop devices involved scams, phishing, and malvertising, exploiting human vulnerabilities more than technical weaknesses.A significant rise in scams using sophisticated technologies like deepfake videos and AI-manipulated audio was noted. These scams often utilize hijacked YouTube channels and other social media platforms to spread fraudulent content. The report highlighted that such deceptive practices are becoming more complex, with cybercriminals leveraging high-profile events and figures to enhance the credibility of their scams.YouTube, in particular, has emerged as a critical vector for these threats. Avast’s telemetry indicated that in the previous year, four million unique users were protected against YouTube-based threats, with around 500,000 users shielded in the first quarter alone. Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting YouTube’s automated advertising and user-generated content features to sidestep traditional security measures, deploying a variety of attack vectors from phishing campaigns to malware distribution.The report outlined several prevalent scam tactics on YouTube:Phishing campaigns specifically target creators with fraudulent collaboration offers, leading to malware dissemination and account compromises.Attackers post videos with descriptions containing malicious links, disguising them as legitimate downloads for popular software.Channel hijacking, where attackers gain control of YouTube accounts to push various scams, including crypto schemes that often start with fake giveaways.Attackers exploit reputable software brands and create domains that mimic legitimate companies to distribute malware disguised as genuine software.Beyond individual platforms, the broader trend of Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) was identified as a growing sector within cybercrime. Criminals rent out malware, facilitating a commission-based partnership where even less experienced hackers can launch attacks. This model simplifies the process of executing cyberattacks, making advanced tools accessible to a broader range of criminals.Malware types such as DarkGate and Lumma Stealer were specifically mentioned for their propagation methods, including spreading via platforms like Microsoft Teams and YouTube. These methods underscore the continual evolution of cybercriminal strategies, emphasizing the role of social engineering.Jakub Kroustek, Malware Research Director at Gen, remarked on the severity of the situation,“In the first quarter of 2024, we reported the highest ever cyber risk ratio – meaning the highest probability of any individual being the target of a cyberattack.”He added that human vulnerabilities are a significant focus for cybercriminals, who exploit emotional responses and curiosity to gain access to personal information and financial assets.As technically focused exploits and hacks in crypto have fallen over the past year, Avast’s report showcases how non-technical attacks have risen. Human vulnerabilities are often the hardest aspects of op-sec and AI appears to already have made sufficient progress to offer a considerable challenge for security experts.Latest Alpha Market Report

President Biden blocks Chinese-backed crypto miner near Wyoming nuclear site


After a Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining firm tried to buy land near a nuclear missile base in Wyoming, United States, President Joe Biden issued an order preventing this purchase, citing “national security risk” due to the vicinity of the nuclear site.
Specifically, the order prohibits the purchase and demands the divestment of the real estate belonging to a company largely owned by Chinese nationals and located within one mile of Francis E. Warren Air Force Base (F.E. Warren AFB), according to the US Treasury Department’s press release on May 13.
Also, it seeks “the removal of certain improvements and equipment at the property by MineOne Partners Limited, (…) majority owned by nationals of the People’s Republic of China; MineOne Cloud Computing Investment I L.P.; MineOne Data Center LLC; and MineOne Wyoming Data Center LLC (collectively MineOne), as well as their affiliates.”


Reasoning behind Biden’s order
Furthermore, listing the reasons for this decision, the press release stated that F.E. Warren AFB is a “strategic missile base and home to Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles” and that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS) had investigated this transaction.
Commenting on the President’s decision, the US Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen explained that:

“Today’s divestment order (…) highlights the critical gatekeeper role that CFIUS serves to ensure that foreign investment does not undermine our national security, particularly as it relates to transactions that present risk to sensitive US military installations as well as those involving specialized equipment and technologies.”

Crypto issue in Trump – Biden race
As a reminder, the incumbent US President has received scathing criticism from the crypto community due to his perceived hostility toward crypto assets, heightened after his recent announcement that he would veto legislation enabling highly regulated financial firms to act as custodians for crypto assets.
In response, his main opponent in the presidential race, former US President Donald Trump, expressed support for the crypto sector, arguing that Biden didn’t understand crypto but that he himself was “fine with it,” suggesting that other crypto supporters should vote for him, as Finbold reported on May 9.

All Eyes on Bitcoin Turned to Powell's Statements: What Time Will He Speak? Will There Be a Powell Pump in Prices? What are the expectations? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Although the high inflation that the FED has been struggling with for a long time has receded slightly, it is still above the FED's 2% inflation target.
At this point, while the possibility of the FED reducing interest rates is decreasing day by day, and the uncertainties regarding the FED's next term interest policy continue to make pricing difficult, all eyes in the markets are today on FED Chairman Jerome Powell's statements and PPI data.


While the signals to be received from the inflation data that will be announced in the US economy starting today are expected to increase volatility in the markets, the results of the New York FED's Consumer Expectations Survey for April, which was recently announced, increased concerns.
According to the survey results, while consumers' short-term inflation expectations increased, analysts stated that both the increase in inflation expectations and the cautious stance of FED officials negatively affected the risk appetite in the markets.





At this point, while analysts think that today's PPI and Powell's statements may affect investor decisions, he said that CPI data will be followed tomorrow.
Analysts also added that the question marks regarding the FED's next term road map may decrease after the PPI and CPI data.


Will Powell Pump Come to Bitcoin?
PPI and CPI data, which are among the important data followed by the FED for inflation, and FED President Jerome Powell's statements regarding interest rates have a great impact on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
The analyst, who thinks that this week's CPI, Core CPI, PPI and FED president's speech will affect the direction of the Bitcoin price, expects volatility to increase in BTC after Powell's statements and data.





At this point, some analysts state that Powell's speech will have a positive impact on the BTC price and there will be an increase, while others think that we will see inflation data slow down for the first time, if not this month, then soon.
FED President Jerome Powell will speak at the Dutch Foreign Bankers Association panel. His speech will start at 17.00 Türkiye time.

Uniswap Marks $4B Mobile Swaps, Brings L3 Projects Soon | Cryptopolitan

Uniswap has reached a milestone of $4B swaps through its mobile app. Decentralized trading is still comparatively small against big exchange volumes, but has helped grow the crypto and DeFi infrastructure, while offering highly accessible swaps. The potential for swaps means some of the trades are borderless and permissionless. Uniswap has added an optional feature for Know Your Customer (KYC) screenings, but some pairs may be accessible without the process. The Uniswap web app also offers limit orders, to simulate centralized trading and automate decisions. Uniswap is also available on more than seven leading L1 blockchains in addition to Ethereum, hosting their newly minted tokens. The most active chains include Arbitrum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, XDAI, Optimism, and Polygon.The Uniswap team also claims that its high liquidity and leading position allow the DEX to offer better swaps compared to price aggregators. For wallet holders using the web app, Uniswap also offers easier swapping by switching between different wallets and networks. The Uniswap team is also highly active in adding new features, with 53 weekly commits to the codebase. Uniswap Hints at L3 AssetsUniswap sent out a cryptic message, which may be taken as a suggestion the exchange will carry L3 assets of some form. Layer 3, or L3, emerged as a new moniker for restaking tokens, or other assets based on locking collaterals of ETH. There is no clear list of what makes an L3 asset, as most restaking protocols started as tokenless projects. However, some of those projects rewarded points or other placeholder balances. Restaking protocols are thus setting expectations of launching a new wave of tokens and a new level of decentralized complexity. The next months may bring the L3 trend on Ethereum to fruition. Uniswap is also facing the challenge of absorbing Bitcoin-based DeFi and tokens. Which Layer 3 Will Go to Uniswap?Uniswap has not clearly stated it would list a specific Layer 3 project, or simply allow liquidity building for a series of new tokens. Making the best guess, the protocol in question may be Layer3XYZ, which is preparing to launch its native asset this summer. Layer3XYZ already aggregates L3 and restaking protocols, making the process easier. In L3, earning points and keeping track of all gains may be difficult, especially after the launch of multiple restaking pools and hubs. Layer3XYZ aims to reflect the entire L3 ecosystem in a single native token, coming up soon. L3 grew after the boom of EigenLayer, which became a leader in restaked ETH tokens and in issuing point-based rewards. So far, there is no clear list of the reward platforms on EigenLayer, and it is uncertain which ones would be ready to launch tokens. Uniswap Still Leads DEX RosterUniswap is still contributing to the usage of Ethereum’s blockchain, and remains among the most used DEX. The gas fees paid in a month indicate Uniswap usage. The exchange hosts both user-generated transactions, and MEV bots to optimize swaps. Uniswap is the leader in terms of both daily trades and total value locked. The current DeFi season is slower compared to 2021, but Uniswap still caries $5.36B in value locked. This is more than double compared to the closest competitor, PancakeSwap. The DEX carries around $1.32B in daily volumes for all versions and liquidity pools. Close to 50% of that activity is through the Ethereum-based Uniswap V3. Activity statistics also show Uniswap communicates with 156K unique wallets daily, even though some of those addresses are linked to trading bots. Uniswap has recovered more than 50% of its peak value locked. One of the reasons for the lower value is the native token, UNI. During peak times, UNI traded close to $40, but now Uniswap has to deal with a native asset at $6.90. For 2024, UNI peaked at around $15 before the April correction.The leading DEX continues to carry major assets, including highly active meme tokens. Additionally, Uniswap almost constantly lists new tokens with no barrier to entry except for liquidity. Those new tokens are held by a few dozen users at best, and are often risky and volatile. Their liquidity pools are often under 10 wETH.

Coinbase CLO Rallies Binance, Ripple, Uniswap to Resist SEC's 'Gaslighting'

Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of Coinbase Global Inc., has called on other crypto platforms on the U.S. SEC’s radar to reject the commission’s crack-down approach.Coinbase CLO points out SEC’s gaslightingAccording to Paul Grewal, the Securities and Exchange Commission refuses to provide clarity on its crackdown tactics. It is worth noting that Coinbase has a major legal brawl with the market regulator over the alleged support for securities tokens.To drive home his point, Grewal tagged other firms the regulator has sued or issued a Wells Notice to. He called on Binance, Ripple, Uniswap, Robinhood and Kraken to ask whether or not they got full clarity on the key reasons behind the Wells Notice or charges levied against them.To Grewal, that the SEC brings up charges without a "thorough explanation" is straight-up gaslighting before Judge Shelby and the United States District Court. He believes this is wrong and should not stand. There are different claims against the SEC’s stance that some of the top altcoins on the market are securities. The ruling from Judge Analisa Torres that XRP in itself is not a security forms the most defined clarity over the past year.Grasping at strawsDespite the clarity the XRP ruling provided, the regulator is still grasping at straws and is vehemently pursuing remedies from Ripple. This remedy stems from the part of the ruling that faults the company for selling XRP to institutional investors.Some of the SEC’s targets, including Robinhood, have revealed several attempts to connect with the SEC to discuss its process. In all, the SEC’s inconsistent feedback has left a major gray area that it is hanging on to sue crypto players.There is a major trend now, however, and it hinges on the readiness of these affected firms to fight their case in court.

Roaring Kitty's Return Sparks Rally: Future of Meme Coins?


In the financial world, few stories are captivated, like that of Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty. This former financial analyst turned stock influencer sparked the 2021 GameStop (GME) short squeeze. 
His actions shook Wall Street, capturing the global attention. After a significant hiatus, Gill has recently returned to social media, sparking renewed interest in both traditional and crypto markets.
Who is Roaring Kitty?
Known under the alias “DeepFuckingValue,” Gill became a hero on platforms like Reddit and YouTube. He was a vocal advocate for GameStop, a company that was largely considered faltering at the time. Many institutional investors and hedge funds had shorted GME, expecting its value to decline further.
However, the narrative took a sharp turn when GME shares, initially valued at around $5.16, surged to exceed $490 in 2021. This price inflation was primarily driven by users from the r/WallStreetBets subreddit. 
Gill’s posts there had inspired a collective action to trigger a short squeeze. This market maneuver occurs when rising stock prices compel short sellers to purchase shares at increasing rates, thereby escalating the stock price even further.
From an initial investment of $53,000, Gill’s stakes in GME soared to an impressive $48 million at the peak of the market upheaval. His significant role in this market anomaly brought him before Congress for testimony and was later depicted in the film “Dumb Money.”

Will Cat-Theme Meme Coins Pump?
Upon his return to the public eye with an X (Twitter) post in mid-2021, Gill once again stirred the investment world. The post featured an image of a man intently using a video game controller. It quickly sparked discussions in stock investment circles and in the crypto domain. 
Influencers like Andrew Tate announced shifts in their investment strategies, from Bitcoin to GameStop stocks and various meme coins. Tate said he would sell $500,000 in Bitcoin to invest in the latest GameStop short squeeze. Moreover, he put the ticker symbol of GME on his X bio.


The resurgence of interest following Gill’s tweet extended to meme coins, a sector known for its high volatility and speculative nature. These digital assets, often inspired by internet memes, experienced a noticeable boost. 
For instance, the Roaring Kitty (KITTY) meme coin saw remarkable trading activity, with one trader turning a $3,000 investment into $94,000 almost overnight due to a sudden price surge.
Now, investors and spectators alike are pondering the future of meme coins in this revived market environment. Several of Gill’s videos hint at a potential preference for cat-themed meme coins, possibly heralding the next big rally in this quirky asset class.
On-chain analysis firm – Lookonchain indicates that smart investors are already positioning themselves in cat-related meme coins like POPCAT, MANEKI, and KITTY.


“Maybe the next Dogecoin (DOGE) will be among the cat-themed meme coins,” Lookonchain said.


As the market adapts, the influence of internet personalities like Roaring Kitty is undeniable. His ability to mobilize public opinion and challenge traditional investment strategies reshapes financial landscapes.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Dips Below $62K Ahead of U.S. Inflation Figures

Bitcoin fell below $62,000 during the European morning on Tuesday, losing about 1.63% over 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a broad measurement of the digital asset market as a whole, fell almost 1.1%. Ether declined more than 2% to just above $2,900, while solana was largely unchanged at $145. In the next 24 hours, attention will turn to inflation reports out of the U.S. The latest Producer Price Index (PPI) is set for release at 08:30 ET today and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is due tomorrow. Stubbornly high inflation has previously put paid to hopes of rate cuts in the U.S., which can have the effect of a handbrake on risk assets such as crypto.

                        Adopting a potential digital euro won’t displace the Swedish krona, Sweden’s central bank said.In a staff memo published Tuesday, the Sveriges Riksbank indicated it sees potential benefits for Sweden in the digital euro. It highlighted the possibility of a more robust and competitive payment system.The bank added that there may be a small shift away from traditional bank deposits. However, the Riksbank believes any impact will be limited due to the proposed cap on individual holdings of digital euros.Using the digital euro might extend beyond the eurozone. While it’s designed for eurozone countries, a proposal allows non-eurozone members to potentially join the system through agreements with the European Central Bank (ECB). This could give residents and businesses in those countries access to the digital euro on equal footing with those in the eurozone.Sweden’s central bank downplayed the impact of a potential agreement, arguing that institutional factors won’t “crowd out” the krona. Firstly, payments involving the government are conducted in Swedish kronor, solidifying its position as the primary currency, it said.“For instance, given we pay our taxes in Swedish kronor, we also prefer to receive our salary in Swedish kronor,” the Riksbank said. “And when businesses pay salaries, their main expenditures, in Swedish kronor, they prefer to charge customers in Swedish kronor.”Also, Swedes can use digital euros even if they haven’t visited or lived in the eurozone before. Meanwhile, businesses in Sweden can accept digital euro payments, but they must transfer them directly to a bank account, just like businesses in the eurozone.EU Moves Forward with Digital Euro Exploration
The European Central Bank (ECB) launched a two-year planning stage for the digital euro project late last year. Its goals for this period include finalizing the rules, choosing private sector partners, and running tests and experiments.According to the EU’s draft proposal, which might be revised before release, advantages with a digital euro are significant. Meanwhile, the potential downsides tied to not having one could be substantial.The draft rules give the ECB the authority to restrict how much money individuals can hold in digital form. A possible limit of between 3,000 to 4,000 euros is being discussed.Swedish e-Krona Hinges on Digital Euro
A potential downside of the digital euro is that it could threaten the Swedish krona’s stability. High inflation can lead to price swings. If this becomes a problem in Sweden, businesses might switch to pricing things in euros. People might also choose to hold more of their money in euros (seen as a more stable currency) instead of krona. This “flight to quality” could weaken the krona.Further, the decision to launch a digital Swedish krona, or e-krona, hinges on the development of the digital euro. An e-krona would bolster the Swedish krona’s position within Sweden if the digital euro becomes widely used, according to the bank.Additionally, leveraging the technology and regulations built for the digital euro could significantly reduce the cost and complexity of launching an e-krona. Finally, the coexistence of both digital currencies could lead to smoother cross-border payments, it said.

Dutch court finds Tornado Cash dev Alexey Pertsev guilty of laundering $1.2B - Crypto Briefing




A Dutch court at ‘s-Hertogenbosch has convicted Alexey Pertsev, a 31-year-old Russian national and developer of the crypto mixing platform Tornado Cash, of laundering $1.2 billion in illicit assets.The three-judge panel is expected to sentence Pertsev on Tuesday, and his lawyers will have 14 days to appeal the decision.The verdict is set to have a significant impact on the future of privacy in decentralized finance, as experts believe it will create a “chilling effect” on the development of open-source software that provides users with financial privacy tools.During the trial in March, prosecutors argued that Pertsev did not do enough to prevent criminals from using Tornado Cash, while the defense countered that the open-source and automated nature of the smart contracts at the heart of the platform meant Pertsev could not be held accountable for the actions of anonymous and independent users.Tornado Cash is a decentralized protocol designed to obfuscate transaction histories on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a solution to the inherent privacy issues of publicly visible and immutable records.Despite this definition, however, prosecutors rejected the idea that the technological concepts outweighed legal obligations to prevent platforms from aiding criminals and sanctioned entities, such as North Korean cybercrime groups, in concealing the origins of stolen assets.Public prosecutor Martine Boerlage argued that Tornado Cash was run like a company, despite claims that it operated without leadership.The platform has been used to launder crypto from hacks and heists worth over $7 billion, according to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, with the North Korean cybercrime organization Lazarus Group being a key abuser of the protocol.The crypto industry has shown support for Pertsev through advocacy efforts, petitions, and attempts to cover his legal fees. Fellow Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm is facing similar charges in the US, with his trial scheduled for September 23. Experts speculate that Pertsev’s guilty verdict may foreshadow Storm’s fate.Note: This story is developing and will be updated with statements from involved parties.

AI Could Send Smart Contract Platforms to Massive $25,000,000,000,000 Valuation, Says Analyst Jamie Coutts - The Daily Hodl


								Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts says that the layer-1 crypto sector could see a staggering rise in valuation driven by artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
Coutts says on the social media platform X that the total market value of all smart contract platforms could reach a 14-figure price tag in the next six years.










“By 2030, the combined market value of smart contract platforms, driven by the expanding use by AI agents could reach between $15 trillion and $25 trillion.”

The analyst shares an excerpt from his firm’s Pro-Crypto November 2023 report that suggests AI will increase the demand for on-chain verification and authentication services. The report also says that human-directed or autonomous AI agents could make use of smart contract platforms to exchange value, significantly increasing the growth rate.
“By incorporating an ‘AI growth factor’ starting in 2026, which adds 10% to the annual growth rate, we can begin to gauge this impact. Initially, the effect is modest, but by 2030, AI agents could comprise over 40% of total daily active users (DAU). This obviously creates some rather astronomical valuations for the blockchain assets, which will benefit from the transaction fees generated by an increasing number of AI agents.”

Coutts further says that even if the report’s prediction is partially correct, the combined market capitalization of smart contract platforms would still witness tremendous growth.
“Projections based on historical regressions will not hold indefinitely. The key point is that, directionally, network value increases exponentially as the network expands. Even if I am 25% correct on where this all goes, then it’s still a 4x to 5x from the current market cap levels.”

At time of writing, the total market cap of top layer-1 crypto projects is sitting at $1.88 trillion, according to CoinGecko.

Pepe Jumps 19% to All-Time High Following Roaring Kitty Return - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsPEPE has hit a new all time high after climbing 19% in the past 24 hours. This comes after Roaring Kitty’s return has seen GameStop and other memes continue to soar.Financial analyst Roaring Kitty was a central figure to the 2021 GameStop short squeeze which saw the r/WallStreetBets subreddit community attempting to take down hedge funds by purchasing meme stocks. Yesterday, the figure returned to social media after a three year hiatus which saw GameStop double in value and a new meme frenzy begin.The third largest coin in the meme category, according to CoinGecko, started seeing steady gains due to the meme influencer returning. One of his tweets featured a reimagining of a scene from Gangs of New York with the characters’ skin turned green—just like Pepe the frog. It appears this was bullish for the Pepe community with the token jumping 5.5% in a matter of minutes.Roaring Kitty (also known as Keith Gill) returning also sparked a slew of Solana meme coins to launch, with a Pump.fun record being set. Other meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba, and Dogwifhat have also seen significant gains.After Gill’s Gangs of New York tweet, Pepe traded mostly sideways until Coinbase experienced a “system wide outage” early this morning. This saw Pepe’s price periodically fall before unconfirmed rumors began to circulate that the centralized exchange was preparing to list the meme coin and crashed as a result.Coinbase did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.“Looks like Coinbase is down for maintenance again! Maybe they are getting everything ready before they list PEPE,” one Twitter user said. “The volume is gonna [be] 10x and they need to prepare.”It’s worth repeating: There are currently no confirmed reports that Coinbase is going to list PEPE. But the mere suggestion has been enough to cause the meme coin to jump 9% to an all-time high of $0.00001096.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Coins.ph to Trial Stablecoin in Philippines' Remittance Market, Here's Why


							

Approval of Coins.ph’s stablecoin trial signals the Philippines’ openness to blockchain innovation.



PHPC could enhance remittance efficiency, benefiting both senders and recipients.



Amidst regulatory changes, digital payment firms vie for a stake in the Philippines’ remittance market.




The financial realm of the Philippines stands on the brink of change as the central bank gives the green light to Coins.ph to experiment with a groundbreaking stablecoin in the nation’s crucial remittance market. This decision represents a noteworthy progression in the quest to update the remittance sector, which ranks among the largest globally, aiming to boost its effectiveness and accessibility.



Coins.ph, known for its digital currency exchange services, is preparing to introduce PHPC, a stablecoin linked to the Philippine Peso. This comes after receiving approval from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). Under the BSP’s Regulatory Sandbox Framework, the stablecoin will be backed by Coins.ph’s reserves held in Philippine bank accounts, ensuring stability and reliability.



Led by Wei Zhou, formerly Binance’s Chief Financial Officer, Coins.ph aims to introduce PHPC to its platform by early June, following a successful pilot phase. The pilot will gauge the stablecoin’s viability in real-world scenarios and its impact on the existing financial ecosystem. If specific benchmarks are met, full approval is anticipated, allowing Coins.ph to transition out of the sandbox environment.









This development comes amidst the Philippines’ decision to restrict Binance’s operations within its borders and its commitment to launch a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) within the next two years, steering clear of a retail CBDC. Concurrently, digital payments firm Strike has expanded its global money transfer services to the Philippines, further diversifying the remittance landscape.



Expanding its reach, digital payments company Strike has now extended its global money transfer service to the Philippines. This strategic move allows Strike to access the country’s lucrative $12 billion remittance market. It underscores the increasing need within the nation for streamlined and economical options for cross-border transactions.



Coins.ph envisions integrating PHPC into remittance platforms across countries with substantial remittance flows to the Philippines, promising greater efficiency and lower transaction costs for overseas Filipino workers and their families. This move is poised to revolutionize cross-border payments, streamlining processes and fostering financial inclusion.

                        PEPE has hit a new all-time high in the past couple of hours, with the Pepe Coin price currently sitting at $0.00001039 and enjoying a 19% gain today.The meme token’s current price also represents a 23% gain in a week and a hefty 92% increase in a month, with its price benefitting from the return of legendary meme-stock trader Roaring Kitty to X.And with PEPE also up by 440% in a year, it has strong enough momentum to continue rising for the foreseeable future.It could potentially continue breaking its current ATH over the next few days, particularly if Roaring Kitty’s return does instigate a big bull run for meme tokens.Pepe Coin Price Prediction as PEPE Hits New All-Time High – Can PEPE 100x From Here?
PEPE’s indicators are definitely looking bullish right now, with its 30-day average (orange) racing ahead of its 200-day (blue).Its relative strength index (purple) also shot above 80 yesterday evening, and while it has declined a little, its position remains high.Source: TradingViewIn other words, the momentum is still there, with PEPE’s rising resistance (red) and support (green) levels also pointing towards further gains in the near term.What’s particularly bullish is that whales have been buying the meme coin in the past day, indicating an expectation that PEPE will continue to build on its gains.As the tweet below shows, PEPE has seen big purchases during its current run, which is encouraging insofar as you’d expect the whales concerned to hold onto the token for a little while longer at least.Also positive is the aforementioned return of Keith Gill, who under the alias Roaring Kitty led the infamous 2021 GameStop rally and helped spearhead the whole meme-stocks movement.His return may indicate a renewed impetus for that movement, something that could help meme tokens such as PEPE continue to climb to new heights.However, retail investors should be cautious that Gill’s return doesn’t necessarily mean we’re going to have a new GameStops phenomenon in the coming months.Also, with PEPE reaching a new all-time high today, traders should also be wary that it may correct a little before it rises again.As such, they may prefer to hold off from buying PEPE today and wait for a dip, since the coin has actually declined by 3% in the past hour.Yet once this minor correction has ended, the Pepe Coin price could reach $0.000011 or $0.000012 in the next week or so.New Meme Tokens May Also Be Big Gainers
While PEPE is probably the strongest major meme token in the market at the moment, there are numerous newer meme coins that could outperform it in the coming weeks.This includes various presale tokens that have been attracting investors as they prepare to launch, with Sealana (SEAL) – a Solana-based meme token – being one of the most promising.It has raised more than $750,000 in its token offering and is on course to hit $1 million soon, such is the growing investor interest in the token.It’s clear that the market’s appetite for meme coins – particularly Solana-based coins – remains very strong and that SEAL is benefitting from this.It has chosen a distinct meme for itself, adopting a bumbling seal as its mascot, who represents the widespread desire among retail traders to make a quick buck via crypto.One other bullish feature of SEAL is that it has recently announced an Ethereum version of its token, making it a multi-chain meme coin.This should help boost demand for the coin, with investors able to join its sale by visiting the official Sealana website.They can buy SEAL by sending SOL to the following address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.The token is available at an exchange rate of 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which converts to $0.021.VIDEOGiven that meme tokens look ready to continue outperforming the market for the foreseeable future, SEAL is likely to eclipse such a price once it lists.Buy SEAL Today

Vitalik Buterin proposes Ethereum gas model overhaul

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a new Ethereum Improvement Protocol (EIP) 7706 focused on a new gas model for the transaction call data.Ethereum-based transactions currently have two types of gas fees: one for transaction execution, which covers the computational effort required to perform a transaction, and one for storage, which is the cost of storing data in “blobs.”Buterin’s (EIP) 7706 proposes a third form of gas exclusively for call data, the portion of an Ethereum transaction containing key data transmitted to smart contracts. This means the Ethereum blockchain will allocate a unique charge to data transferred during transactions, separate from the costs of executing contract code or storing data. The new gas model will add a transaction type that provides max_basefee and priority_fee as a vector, providing values for execution gas, blob gas and call data gas.At present, the base fee adjustment uses separate mechanisms for the transaction execution cost and the data storage in the form of blobs. However, Buterin suggested that with the introduction of a third type of gas fee, the Ethereum network should adopt a common approach for all three types of gas fees.Related: ZK-proofs introduce security challenges for developersThe move aims to reduce the transaction costs associated with transactions that are data-heavy but not necessarily computationally intensive. If the proposal is accepted, the Ethereum network will be responsible for setting the call data costs independently of other costs. Buterin recommended managing all three forms of gas via a dynamic model that modifies fees simultaneously.Buterin suggested that by implementing a separate gas fee for call data, The “theoretical max call data size of a block would be greatly reduced, while basic economic analysis suggests that on average, call data would become considerably cheaper.”The Ethereum network has struggled with gas fee issues for years now and the main motivation to move from the proof-of-work mining consensus to a proof-of-stake (PoS) was to become more scalable and less costly. However, such critical changes haven’t improved the network’s scalability as promised. Thus, these EIPs come in as a timely aid for the network.Magazine: Big Questions: What did Satoshi Nakamoto think about ZK-proofs?

Roaring Kitty Resurfaces on Social Media, Returns with Cryptic Messages



After almost three years of silence on social media, Gill has resurfaced on Twitter, sending the investing community into a frenzy.

Keith Gill, more popularly known as “Roaring Kitty” or “DeepFuckingValue”, made an unexpected return to Twitter on Sunday. The widely celebrated return follows a hiatus that lasted nearly three years, leaving his followers beaming with anticipation and speculation about his whereabouts or what his next crypto moves would be.
Who Is Roaring Kitty?
Gill rose to prominence in 2021 as one of the key figures behind the GameStop stock buzz. His bold investment calls, which he shared on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, led thousands of retail investors to rally behind GameStop, causing its stock price to skyrocket massively.




The price surge, which he predicted, was so shocking that the profits he made from his investment earned him a hearing as he was called to testify before the US Congress House Committee on Financial Services at the time.
On February 18, 2021, during the hearing, Gill cleared any notions that he may be an institutional investor or a hedge fund. Part of his statement at the time reads:
“I’m just an individual whose investment in GameStop, and posts on social media are based upon my own research and analysis.”
Now, after months of relative silence on social media, Gill has resurfaced on Twitter, sending the investing community into a frenzy. His return, however, has been met with a mix of excitement and curiosity. Some of his followers can’t wait to hear his thoughts on the current state of the market and his latest investment strategies. That is, if he has any. Others, however, wonder why he is making an appearance at this particular moment in time.
Investment Community Anticipates
Interestingly, Gill has taken off from where he left after tweeting in his typical cryptic manner. His return tweet was an image post of a man sitting up in his seat and holding a video game controller. Although he did not mention anything related to GameStop, the price of GME immediately doubled before a 1,900% surge in a Solana-based tribute coin, also named GME.
The image appears to suggest a statement along the line of “let’s do this”, leaving his followers speculating that he may be gearing up for another big play. In all of this, though, one thing is clear. Gill’s influence on the market remains significant. At least, that is what the engagement on his post suggests. His ability to influence retail investors has also not gone unnoticed by Wall Street. Therefore, his return to social media is sure to attract attention from participants in the financial markets.

Pro-XRP Lawyer Deaton Lands Spot On Massachusetts GOP Ballot


								John E. Deaton, a fervent advocate for XRP and critic of current regulatory approaches to digital assets, has officially secured his place on the Massachusetts Republican ballot for the 2024 US Senate elections. Deaton’s campaign announcement has stirred notable attention, setting the stage for a direct challenge against incumbent Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren.
Pro-XRP Lawyer Is Officially On The Ballot
Deaton’s entry into the political arena follows his vocal criticism of what he perceives as overreach by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and particularly targets Senator Warren’s stance on cryptocurrency regulations. “Bad news for one of Washington’s most entrenched career politicians. Elizabeth Warren: Look who’s on the ballot!” Deaton announced on X after confirming the validation of 11,873 signatures needed to secure his candidacy.


In a series of statements shared on X, Deaton expressed his gratitude towards his supporters: “I am proud to announce I am officially on the ballot for the US Senate. A huge thank you to all the volunteers and supporters who worked tirelessly to collect over ten thousand signatures.”
He added, “Make no mistake, I am in this fight to win. Voters in Massachusetts are sick of Washington corruption. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s extremism represents everything that is wrong with our current politics, and why voters are telling me they’re ready for change.”

Deaton has been a significant figure in the legal battles involving XRP, a digital currency often in the crosshairs of US regulators. He pointedly criticized the SEC’s classification of XRP as a security, which contrasts with the stance of several other countries that deem it a non-security asset.
“Japan was one of the countries that declared XRP NOT a security. Yet, our SEC, without any support in the law, declared XRP itself a security,” Deaton remarked. He highlighted his representation of 75,000 XRP holders in the US and globally, arguing their case pro bono, which ultimately led to a legal victory where US District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP itself is not a security.
Reflecting on his legal achievements and his advocacy for cryptocurrency, Deaton positioned his Senate run as part of a broader battle against governmental overreach. “Our next biggest victory against government intrusion and oppression will be when I defeat Warren, come November,” he declared.

Deaton’s campaign has already attracted support from various corners, including crypto-related political action committees (PACs) and individuals within the crypto community like Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson as well as individuals from outside the community like Mark Cuban who view his candidacy as a counter to Senator Warren’s allegedly “irrational attacks on the crypto industry” and her efforts to sever connections between banks and cryptocurrency entities.
As the first GOP candidate to make it onto the Massachusetts ballot for the upcoming election, Deaton’s campaign is poised to be a focal point for discussions on cryptocurrency regulations and their role in broader US policy.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.50588.

Halving Hits Hard: Bitcoin Miners Face Financial Strain


Bitcoin miners are starting to feel pinched as halved rewards become their new reality post-halving.
A spike in network fees briefly eased their strain. Yet, declining transaction fees are now increasing financial pressure.
Post-Halving Pressures Mount for Bitcoin Miners Amid Declining Fees
Kaiko Research recently reported a surge in daily average network fees after the halving. This surge helped Bitcoin miners offset some discomfort, albeit temporarily.
However, the initial user rush to the Runes protocol has cooled. According to Dune Analytics, Runes transactions plummeted by over 4,500%. They fell from 753,814 on April 24 to 16,630 by May 14.

Additionally, halving events often force miners to sell BTC to cover the costs of creating new blocks. Although the spike in fees helped mitigate some selling pressure, the recent fee decline could renew the pressures.

“For instance, Marathon Digital holds 17,631 BTC worth just over $1.1 billion, while Riot Platforms hold another 8,872 BTC worth over $500 million. If miners were forced to sell even a fraction of their holdings over the coming month, this would have a negative impact on markets,” the report reads.

Furthermore, trading activity and liquidity typically decrease during the summer. Last August, the 2% market depth declined to as low as $250 million. This seasonal decline could further complicate the situation for miners and the broader crypto market.
Crypto analyst Maartun echoed Kaiko Research’s finding. He noted that Bitcoin miners’ profitability has plummeted to a 3-year low.

“Bitcoin miners are facing significant underpayment due to the recent halving of block subsidies and relatively low transaction fees. This is likely to cause substantial strain, especially for less efficient miners,” he wrote.


Despite the current situation, crypto analyst PlanB sees a brighter future for the long term. PlanB said that Bitcoin miners’ revenue will bounce back in 2 to 5 months as Bitcoin’s (BTC) price will double.

“[In] 2012: revenue drops [from] $3 million [to] $1.5 million, back in 2 months. [In] 2016: [revenue] drops [from] $60 million [to] $30 million, back in 4 months. [In] 2020: [revenue] drops [from] $500 million [to] $250 million, back in 5 months,” PlanB explained.

As Bitcoin miners weather the post-halving storm, their financial stamina faces a test. Fluctuating fees and market conditions pose challenges and opportunities. With a recovery in miner revenue forecasted, the coming months are pivotal for the sector’s stability and growth.

Ripple dumps 75% of May XRP reserves in a single sell-off


Ripple, the largest XRP holder, sold 150 million tokens from this month’s sell-off reserves on May 13. The sale is worth $75 million, representing 0.25% of XRP’s $28 billion capitalization with the token at $0.50.
On May 1, the company released 1 billion XRP from the initial distribution, locked in monthly escrows until 2027. Ripple then sent 200 million XRP to its treasury account and locked the remaining 800 million in new escrows.
As usual, the selling activity resulted from the treasury account, labeled Ripple (1), sending tokens to the unlabeled account rP4X2…sKxv3. This action causes XRP supply inflation—by putting tokens that have never circulated before into circulation for the first time.


In particular, the recent 150 million XRP sale inflates supply by 0.25%, over an estimated 4.35% yearly inflation.

What happened to Ripple’s 150 million sell-off?
After receiving May’s 150 million, Ripple’s destination account rP4X2…sKxv3 kept 50 million and sent 100 million XRP to rhWt2…E32hk. Notably, this is a usual path for the company’s dumps, following a similar pattern to previous months.
rP4X2hTa7A7udDbE6wczXvPz7XZ63sKxv3 account summary. Source: XRPScan
If the pattern continues, these accounts will distribute Ripple’s XRP to three to five centralized exchanges for the sell-off. Therefore, the 150 million may create supply pressure on the spot market, potentially affecting the price of XRP.
XRP price analysis
It is noteworthy how Ripple sales directly impact XRP’s price. Historically, the token suffered a local crash most of the time Ripple sold its tokens.
In 2024, only three out of 10 sell-off days had positive price action: February 5, 11, and April 14. All the other seven days were of local crashes, evidencing the importance of monitoring the company’s activities.

As of this writing, XRP was trading at $0.507 per token, down nearly 7% from Ripple’s most recent dump. Interestingly, the relative strength index (RSI) indicates weak momentum for the digital asset, forecasting challenges as Ripple inflates its supply.

The U.S. Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market saw a positive turn on Monday, recording a combined net inflow of $65.96 million.What Happened: This uptick comes amid a period of mixed signals in the broader cryptocurrency market, according to data from SoSoValueLeading the charge was the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC with a single-day net inflow of $38.57 million. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF BITB also saw significant inflows, bringing in $20.26 million. Notably, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC did not experience any inflows or outflows on May 13.This positive trend in the U.S. market stands in contrast to outflows witnessed in other regions.Also Read: ‘Republicans Smell Blood In The Water:’ Uniswap CEO Warns Democrats Of ‘Swing States Level Miscalculation’ On CryptoSoSoValue reported that the Hong Kong Bitcoin Spot ETF experienced its third consecutive day of net redemptions, with investors pulling out 519.5 Bitcoin in a single day.This brings the total number of Bitcoin BTC/USD held by the fund down to 3,560, with total net assets currently at $219 million.The contrasting fortunes of U.S. and Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs highlight the fragmented nature of the global cryptocurrency market. While U.S. investors appear to be cautiously re-entering the market, those in other regions may be taking a more cautious approach.Understanding The Landscape: The Importance of TransparencyAs the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, these trends are expected to be a key topic of discussion at Benzinga's upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19. The event will explore the implications of these inflows and outflows on the broader digital asset market and what they signify for the future of financial technology and investment, particularly focusing on how diverse global markets interact with evolving digital asset frameworks.Read Next: Bitcoin Up 3%: What Will Inflation Data And Powell Speech Bring This Week?Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

                        Meme coin FLOKI is going against the grain today. Crypto’s fifth largest meme coin, inspired by Elon Musk’s pet Shiba Inu of the same name, has rallied 8.8% in the last 24 hours and currently trades at a price of $0.0001887.This means long-term FLOKI HODLers have found their digital coffers raised by 28% over the last 30 days and a staggering 430% from this time last year.Many of the largest meme coins by market capitalization are pumping today despite the downturns posted by the market leaders.The world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ($BTC), fell 2% overnight and currently trades at $61,767. Ethereum ($ETH), the token underpinning the most commercially important blockchain, fell 2.4% to trade at $2,910.Standing in stark contrast to either of the biggest coins, Pepe Coin ($PEPE) ballooned 19% to $0.00001056. Original meme coin Dogecoin ($DOGE) posted a light appreciation of around 3.6% and currently trades for $0.1497.Over on FLOKI’s trading chart, we can see a token that broadly rose in step with Bitcoin through early March to peak around the middle of the month.Since then, the token has found strong support between $0.00015 and $0.0002 and appears stable today.With a relative strength index (RSI) of 58 and falling, the token appears to be priced well, although the sell-off could pick up pace and end the rally.Source: TradingViewFLOKI Humbled As Crypto’s Cleverest Doge WienerAI ($WAI) Raises $1.8 Million in Meme Coin ICO.
Fun it may be on a good day, but FLOKI doesn’t offer holders much of value.Its cultural cache seems a bit limited too. After all, it’s a meme coin about Elon Musk’s dog.Before FLOKI, we already had Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, after it we got Bonk and DogWifHat, so investing in FLOKI is really just speculating on future price rises.However, for those who believe in crypto’s longevity, a new generation of meme coins is cropping up which brings bundles of utility along with the laughs.Leading this new generation of coins is WienerAI.$WAI is a brand new meme token and AI companion that may yield potentially eye-watering rallies once word gets out about its core offering.The presale is only a month old, and it has already attracted close $1.8 million in investments.Touted as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner”, WienerAI ($WAI) is a digital companion that gives its owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees.The WienerAI smart contract was audited by Coinsult, a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms.Around 20% of $WAI’s supply is for staking.WienerAI’s website offers buyers the ability to stake during the presale, in order to take advantage of the lucrative yield, which is currently 543% APY.Stay on top of WienerAI news over on X and Telegram.Join the presale now over on the WienerAI website.

XRP Analyst Forecasts the Next Cycle Top for September 2024


							

EGRAG Crypto forecasts XRP’s next cycle top for September 9, 2024.



His analysis covered the timeframes of previous cycles.



EGRAG advises market readiness, noting that deviation from expected patterns by the target date would signal a change in trend.




Popular crypto expert EGRAG Crypto, known for his XRP analysis, shared a forecast regarding XRP’s “Super Guppy Cycle Top” in September 2024. EGRAG’s analysis compared the current cycle to past patterns, offering projections and potential insights into XRP’s trajectory over the coming months. For clarity, the Super Guppy indicator is a group of exponential moving averages (EMA) that indicate changes in price action.



EGRAG’s analysis covered timeframes of previous cycles, highlighting Cycle 1’s peak occurrence after 287 days and Cycle 2’s after 133 days. Furthermore, he drew parallels to Cycle 3, which began with the Super Guppy turning green in November 2023. As such, the XRP analyst suggested a potential cycle top in approximately 112 days, following Cycle 1’s pattern.



Meanwhile, EGRAG Crypto pointed readers to his previous tweet from May 5th, titled “This Time is Different,” which focused on the behavior of the 21 EMA and 55 MA on a 2-weekly timeframe. 



“I recommend revisiting the post from May 5th titled “This Time is Different,” where the 21 EMA and 55 MA on the 2-weekly timeframe suggest the potential cycle top might occur in September 2024,” he said.



EGRAG’s comparison indicated that while the duration from the bullish cross has surpassed Cycle B’s timeframe, it remains within Cycle A’s range. Accordingly, September 9th, 2024, emerged as a potential date for the next cycle top if historical patterns repeat.









To conclude his analysis, EGRAG called for readiness among XRP enthusiasts and market participants. He suggested that if September 9th passes without XRP reaching an all-time high or experiencing significant upward movement, it will deviate from historical patterns.



“STAY READY! If we pass the 9th of September and #XRP has not reached an ATH or experienced a major pump, then I can confidently say, “This Time is Different.” EGRAG stated via X.



On the current market front, XRP trades at $0.5052 during press time, reflecting a 0.21% intraday increase.

This AI Altcoin's 'Predatory Tokenomics' Will Fill The Pockets Of Team And Insiders, Trader Warns - Benzinga

Renowned Bybit trader DeFi^2  raised concerns about Worldcoin’s WLD/USD long-term viability and potential for aggressive short-selling, arguing that Worldcoin’s “universal basic income” mission statement masks a wealth transfer benefiting insiders.What Happened: According to the trader’s analysis, the coin may be facing a grim future:“Worldcoin realistically might become the greatest transfer of wealth of this entire cycle. Unfortunately, this wealth transfer isn’t in the form of universal basic income as their mission suggests, but instead to the pockets of the team and insiders,” DeFi^2 expressed in a cautionary post. This criticism highlights a growing skepticism about the project’s objectives and its operational transparency.DeFi^2 outlined specific details that suggest the possibility of aggressive short-selling due to the project’s tokenomics and insider activities.“At its current $60 billion fully diluted valuation, right now it is being devalued by 0.6% a day from emissions of grant and operator claims,” he noted, pointing out that these claims are mostly sold immediately upon release, as indicated by on-chain analytics.Moreover, the Worldcoin Foundation‘s recent decision to sell $200 million worth of tokens to trading firms—which amounts to 18% of the circulating supply—raises alarms about the potential dilution of value for existing holders.These tokens, sourced from what is ambiguously termed the “Community” allocation, seem to be strategically offloaded to entities that might not prioritize community interests.Also Read: Keith Gill’s ‘Roaring Kitty’ Comeback Sparks 1400% Surge Of Kitty-Themed Meme CoinThe concern doesn't stop there, as DeFi^2 warns of an upcoming period where venture capital and team unlocks that could dramatically increase the supply: “In just 70 days… WLD supply will begin inflating at 4% PER DAY from unlocks + emissions.”This could translate to nearly $50 million a day of continuous sell pressure, a scenario that could devastate the coin’s market value.Accusations of predatory financial arrangements were starkly put forth, likening Worldcoin's strategies to those previously seen in notorious market manipulations. “The manipulative low float/high FDV design is straight out of the SBF playbook, and directly enriches insiders as they hedge their locked allocations at high valuations pre-unlock via perps/OTC,” DeFi^2 remarked.Most concerning is the misconception held by retail investors about the affiliations and endorsements of the project. Many are unaware that Sam Altman, often associated with leading tech innovations, has no active involvement with Worldcoin, which also has no connection to OpenAI.What’s Next: As the cryptocurrency community braces for these developments, these concerns are likely to be a topic of intense discussion at the upcoming Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.This event will provide a platform for experts to delve deeper into the impacts of market strategies like those employed by Worldcoin, exploring the broader implications for investors and the integrity of the digital asset space.Read Next: Arthur Hayes: ‘Major Economies To Print Even More Money’ In The Next 24 MonthsImage: Shutterstock

Will Shiba Inu (SHIB) Succeed in Invalidating This Downtrend?


Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price is seeking support from the broader market cues and its investors to break free from the ongoing downtrend.
This could happen in the coming days as SHIB holders have switched from selling to HODLing.
Shiba Inu Investors Seem Serious
Shiba Inu’s price has not always noted an impact of its investors’ actions in bullish scenarios since the meme coin is mostly a whale token. However, conviction among retail and whales is certainly a positive factor for the meme coin.
This increasing confidence towards a rise is visible in their action and evident in the decline in active deposits. Active Deposits refer to the unique addresses that move SHIB from their wallets to the exchange deposits. A spike in this metric is also synonymous with increased selling pressure.

In the case of SHIB, the active deposits are consistently declining. Currently, this metric is at a multi-week low, which means that investors are not too keen on selling their assets.
Shiba Inu Active Deposits. Source: Santiment
This sentiment is further strengthened by the fact that even short-term investors are acting bullishly. The overall supply held by them has declined by 1 trillion SHIB worth over $22.3 million in the span of three weeks. 
This is a positive sign since short-term holders tend to hold their supply for less than a month. As a result, the asset becomes susceptible to selling and corrections. 
However, a move from short to mid-term holders is positive since the latter hold their SHIB for over a month and less than a year.

Put simply, SHIB appears to be in a good place.
SHIB Price Prediction: Looking for a Breakout

Shiba Inu’s price of $0.00002387 is above the critical support of $0.00002093. This level has been holding strong for a while, and so has the downtrend line. However, SHIB is initiating a breakout, which, aided by investors, could lead to a rally.
For the same, the meme coin would need to first flip the resistance at $0.00002584 into support. This would push SHIB towards $0.00002835 breaching, resulting in a bull run.

On the other hand, a breakdown below $0.00002093 could result in a massive drawdown to $0.00001473, the next crucial support. There is also a possibility that a failed breach could keep the meme coin consolidated within $0.00002584 and $0.00002093, invalidating the bullish thesis in any case.

We asked ChatGPT-4o what will be Bitcoin price at the end of 2024; Here’s what it said


Given the high hopes that persisted through much of 2024 stemming from the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the reaching of a new all-time high (ATH) in March, and the April halving event, there has been a surprising amount of drama and uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin (BTC) in recent weeks.
Indeed, while earlier analyses predicted Bitcoin would hit $100,000 in no time, and some of the cryptocurrency’s bigger bulls estimating it can reach $300,000 by the end of 2024, the debate has shifted on whether the coin can even hold above $60,000 or if BTC will need to find its footing at the $52,000 support level.
Though the change in attitude is hardly surprising given BTC’s protracted struggle to hold its own in the crypto market and its recent, short-lived fall below $57,000, it has left little clarity to crypto traders about what is next for the world’s premier cryptocurrency.

In its quest to find at least some answers about what may lie ahead, Finbold decided to consult the most advanced version of OpenAI’s flagship artificial intelligence (AI) platform – ChatGPT-4o – about where Bitcoin might stand at the tail-end of 2024.
ChatGPT sets BTC price for end of 2024
After analyzing Bitcoin’s performance in 2024 and beyond, ChatGPT offered a cautiously bullish prediction for where BTC might stand in December. 
According to the AI, the coin is most likely to find itself in the range between $80,000 and $85,000 by the year’s end given that Bitcoin price today stands at $61,711.

Given that it cited the long-term effects of the halving, the likely institutional adoption and regulatory clarity, and the broader economic uncertainty – all factors used by many other analysts to make far more bullish projections – Finbold challenged ChatGPT over its price target.
The AI, however, held to its previous assessment, explaining that, even though it laid out a fairly bullish trajectory, Bitcoin is still facing significant competition from altcoins, regulatory clarity is not expected to be total or completely favorable, there are significant psychological resistance levels ahead, and historic patterns show diminishing returns from each subsequent halving.

ChatGPT offers a bullish but plausible BTC alternative
ChatGPT also proved willing to construct a more bullish scenario which, while taking into account the same factors as for its general estimate, projects they’d have a significantly greater impact. 
Thus, the AI estimates that the upper plausible bound for Bitcoin’s price at the end of 2024 stands at $120,000.
ChatGPT offers a bearish but plausible alternative
Similarly, ChatGPT agreed to look at a hypothetical situation that could drive Bitcoin into the ground. 
The AI explained that should the regulatory crackdown against cryptocurrencies intensify, the global economy recover more fully and rapidly than anticipated, and should Bitcoin face unforeseen and significant technical challenges, the price of BTC might collapse to $30,000 by late December.

Two Reasons Why Ethereum ($ETH) Is Underperforming Bitcoin ($BTC) As an Asset | Cryptoglobe


                                
The Ethereum blockchain has long faced issues with scalability, particularly during high activity periods that lead to network congestion, slow transaction times, and high gas fees. These challenges affect user experience and limit the network’s capacity to support a diverse range of applications. The Dencun upgrade, introduced in March 2024, represents a significant advancement towards resolving these issues by laying the groundwork for future scalability improvements.



Dencun, which combines elements from the Cancun and Deneb upgrades, does not provide an immediate solution to all scalability problems. However, it is a crucial milestone in Ethereum’s development. Central to the Dencun upgrade is the concept of “proto-danksharding,” which sets the stage for future sharding implementations. Sharding involves partitioning the blockchain into smaller shards, each capable of processing transactions independently. This parallel processing is expected to substantially increase Ethereum’s transaction throughput in the future. While Dencun does not implement sharding directly, it establishes the necessary technical foundation for its eventual deployment.



The primary focus of Dencun is not directly reducing transaction fees on the Ethereum mainnet. Instead, it aims to optimize fees within Layer 2 networks. Layer 2 solutions function on top of the Ethereum blockchain, aggregating transactions off-chain before submitting them back to the mainnet. This process helps mitigate congestion on the main network and can potentially lower fees for users.



A significant feature of Dencun is EIP-4844, which lowers the cost for Layer 2 networks to submit their bundled transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. This improvement is expected to enhance the efficiency of Layer 2 solutions, potentially reducing fees for their users. However, the actual fee reductions observed may not be as substantial as initially projected, and the long-term effects on fees will need further monitoring.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

One unintended consequence of the Dencun upgrade has been its impact on the Ethereum supply. The reduction in transaction fees led to a decrease in the amount of ETH burned. Previously, higher network activity and fees resulted in more ETH being burned, contributing to a deflationary effect on its total supply. Following the Ethereum Merge, which transitioned the network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, this deflationary mechanism was an anticipated benefit. However, with fewer fees being burned and the natural increase in supply, the total supply of ETH has started to grow at a faster rate, shifting back towards an inflationary model.



The Dencun upgrade has prompted a fresh analysis from CryptoQuant, a respected South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm. This upgrade, according to CryptoQuant, may significantly alter Ethereum’s progression towards becoming an “ultra sound money” – a concept that denotes a currency that appreciates or maintains its value over time.







The other problem for Ethereum is that once the U.S. SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, many people thought that probably within a few months, the SEC would start approving some, if not all, of the several pending spot Ethereum ETF proposals. Unfortunately, with the SEC’s recent crackdown against the Ethereum ecosystem (e.g. Uniswap receiving a Wells notice last month), it seems that SEC Chair Gary Gensler sees Ether (ETH) as a security (which is what Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin suspects) and therefore the expectations for spot Ethereum ETFs getting approved in the U.S. sometime in 2024 have been dramatically lowered. Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, says he wouldn’t be surprised if we do not see an approval until 2025.







As for the extent of ETH’s underperformance against BTC, as the following  ETH-BTC price chart shows, in the past one-year period, ETH id down 30% vs BTC.

LUNC And USTC Revival: Terra Community Votes To Make Allnodes An Official Organization | Bitcoinist.com


								The Terra community isn’t relenting in its efforts to revive the LUNC and USTC tokens and take them back to their old glory days. This time, the community has proposed a proposal to ensure that the Luna Classic’s (LUNC) circulating supply data is well documented. 
Terra Community Proposes All Allnodes As An Official Organization
The text proposal titled ‘Change official CS API endpoint to Allnodes FCD’ aims to make Allnodes an official organization of the Terra community. Allnodes will be responsible for “hosting the endpoint, providing the correct circulating supply data for Luna Classic.” The proposal also aims to get an agreement from community members about how this circulating supply should be calculated. 
Related Reading: Crypto Price Predictions For 2024: Dogecoin To $2 And XRP To $3
Furthermore, the proposal highlighted why the appointment of an organization like Allnodes has become necessary. It noted that the absence of a named individual or organization to provide this circulating supply data has opened up the possibility of just anyone making changes to this data, which “could be harmful to the chain.” The proposal also included that such unauthorized changes can usually be made without informing developers, validators, or community members
Therefore, it has become essential to appoint an “official source” like Allnodes, which will be the go-to platform for getting the correct data on LUNC’s circulating supply. To accomplish this, Allnodes will be asked to update to the latest FCD version that implements the agreed mechanism for calculating LUNC’s supply. 
The Proposed Method For Calculating LUNC’s Circulating Supply
The proposed method for calculating LUNC’s circulating supply is to deduct unvested tokens, community pool holdings, and staked and bonded tokens from the total supply. Before now, LUNC’s circulating supply is said to have been calculated by deducting the unvested tokens, community pool holdings, and configured bank accounts from the total supply. This former calculation led to LUNC being handled differently from all other native tokens.

Meanwhile, the proposal noted that the circulating supply inside FCD must not be changed without a governance vote going forward. If passed, Allnodes FCD API will also act as the official information source for USTC and all other native tokens besides Luna Classic. Allnodes already agreed to take up the role as long as the proposal is passed. 
Interestingly, data from the Galaxy Station (where the proposal was put up) shows that Allnodes has yet to vote on it. Meanwhile, twelve validators have voted yes in favor of the proposal, one has voted no against the proposal, and one other validator has voted no with veto power. 
Only 5.46% of those authorized to vote have voted, meaning the quorum of 40% needed to pass the proposal is far from being met. However, voting closes on May 19, so there is still enough time for the proposal to pass.

Ethereum Whales Fuel Market Confidence with Massive ETH Exchange Withdrawals ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
As Ethereum (ETH) grapples with a downward spiral in its market value, recent large-scale withdrawals from exchanges by whales have injected a dose of optimism into the cryptocurrency community. The past week has witnessed a flurry of significant transactions, indicating strategic maneuvers by institutional players to fortify their positions amidst market volatility.



According to insights from “The Data Nerd,” an analyst specializing in tracking unusual crypto transactions. Coinbase has recorded multiple high-value Ethereum withdrawals.



On Tuesday, the pundit reported that within 24 hours, four distinct wallets orchestrated withdrawals totaling a staggering 78,301 ETH, equivalent to approximately $231.2 million. Notable among these transactions were withdrawals by wallets labeled “0xF7f” and “0xE51,” each withdrawing 30,440 ETH, amounting to around $90 million.



This surge in withdrawal activity follows closely on the heels of a substantial transaction reported on Monday by the same analyst. A single whale, identified by the address “0x36D,” withdrew 23,286 ETH, valued at approximately $67.83 million, from Coinbase. Over four days, this entity executed withdrawals totaling 30,870 ETH, worth roughly $89.7 million. Such pronounced movements by influential market participants have ignited discussions regarding their potential impact on Ethereum’s price trajectory.



That said, the recent influx of withdrawal activity echoes earlier reports indicating whale investors’ significant accumulation of Ethereum. On May 9, crypto transactions tracking platform Lookonchain highlighted a whale who initiated a series of sizable acquisitions, culminating in the withdrawal of 6,030 ETH from Binance. This move, valued at over $18 million, was interpreted as a strategic maneuver to bolster holdings amidst anticipation of a market rebound. Subsequently, the investor staked the acquired Ethereum into Lido, a decentralized liquidity staking protocol, further underscoring confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects.

Analysts suggest that these maneuvers reflect a broader trend of large investors leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) tools to enhance their positions in the cryptocurrency market, particularly Ethereum. By utilizing staked Ethereum as collateral to secure loans from decentralized lending protocols like AAVE, investors can access additional capital to fuel further acquisitions and capitalize on projected price surges.



Despite Ethereum’s recent price volatility, optimism persists within the market. At press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,916, representing a modest drop of 1.78% over the past 24 hours. Analysts are now eyeing $2,900 as a potential floor for the beleaguered asset, with resistance building around $3,310.

Binance Futures to Remove XRP and TUSD as Margin Assets, Converting to USDT | Coinspeaker



The announcement by Binance to stop supporting XRP could have some negative sentiment on the coin as various speculations about the possible reasons are expected to start flying.

Binance Futures, a division of Binance, a leading crypto exchange platform, has declared that it will cease to support XRP and TUSD as margin assets. This latest development is slated to take effect on May 28, 2024, at 06:00 UTC. In a swift action by the exchange company, it has already set the transfer-in-limit for the two cryptocurrencies to zero as of 06:00 UTC today, which is a means of preventing users of the platform from depositing the digital assets into their USDⓈ-M Futures wallets for margin trading.
The exchange further disclosed that any XRP and TUSD that are not withdrawn in users’ USDⓈ-M Futures wallets after the deadline will be automatically converted into USDT (Tether), a move that will ensure the users’ funds are not left stranded on the platform.  To ensure transparency in the conversion process, it was revealed that the exchange rate of XRP into USDT will be based on the average XRPUSDT price index. It will be calculated from 05:00 UTC to 06:00 UTC on May 28, 2024, while TUSD will be converted at a 1:1 ratio, which means the coin will be exchanged for one USDT.




Binance users are, however, cautioned not to open new futures positions during the conversion period. This is to prevent traders from experiencing potential losses during fund conversion from XRP and TUSD to USDT, as the exchange will not be liable for any losses incurred on any new trade during this period. Similarly, traders on the platform have also been informed that the conversion of XRP and TUSD balances may not immediately reflect in their transaction history.
XRP’s Ongoing Legal Battle with the SEC: Impact on Price and Adoption
This announcement comes amid the ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple XRP. Recently, Ripple filed a motion requesting the court to seal certain key details related to documents concerning the case’s remedies. The lawsuit against Ripple has yet to be decided, which has been part of the reason why the coin’s price has been dragging.
XRP has been dropping since early this month, experiencing an over 15% drop in the last three weeks. However, the coin shows signs of recovery, as price action is trading in the green candlestick, reflecting that bullish activities are ongoing. However, the recovery could be short-lived.
The announcement by Binance to stop supporting XRP could have some negative sentiment on the coin as various speculations about the possible reasons are expected to start flying. Although Binance did not link the decision to stop supporting XRP as a margin asset to the ongoing Ripple court issue. The fear of such a move could increase the negative sentiment towards the coin, which could still affect the price growth this year as it has been since 2019. The massive XRP withdrawal or conversion to other crypto assets, which is expected to happen in the next few days, could also cause the price to dip more.

Billionaire Shark Mark Cuban Warns The SEC's Anti-Crypto Stance Could Cost Biden The Election - Benzinga

Known for his many business ventures, Mark Cuban has also been a long-term investor in crypto, specifically taking large positions in Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), and NFTs. These investments have signaled his openness and support for crypto. He recently shared his thoughts on the current state of cryptocurrency as it relates to regulation.Don't Miss:"If @joebiden loses, there is a good chance you will be able to thank @GaryGensler and the @NewYork_SEC. Crypto is a mainstay with younger and independent voters. Gensler HAS NOT PROTECTED A SINGLE INVESTOR AGAINST FRAUD. All he has done is make it nearly impossible for legitimate crypto companies to operate, killing who knows how many businesses and ruining who knows how many entrepreneurs," Cuban posted on X. Cuban is referring to the different ways in which he believes that the SEC chair, Gary Gensler, has prevented crypto adoption in the U.S. According to Cuban, Gensler is operating under the guise of preventing fraud and allowing Americans to access trustworthy investments but instead has created an environment where it is hard to create a crypto business that complies with the many SEC regulations.One comment noted that the SEC is simply attempting to take precautions against pump-and-dump and other fraudulent activities. Cuban responded, saying, "Now compare it to OTC and Pink Sheets in today's US market. Even with the relatively new regs, it's a cesspool. And remember our SEC lets billions and billions of shares in bankrupt companies trade all the time."Trending: Large boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets — has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?Essentially, Cuban is noting that the SEC may have a double standard when it comes to some penny stocks and bankrupt companies, as it allows those to trade while crypto is subject to much more scrutiny. "This is also a warning to Congress. Crypto voters will be heard this election. You could solve this problem for Biden by passing legislation that defines registration that is specific to the crypto industry just as other industries have registration that is defined for them. Or you could do the better option and assign all crypto to be regulated by the @CFTC," Cuban also added.As the presidential election continues to heat up, cryptocurrency emerges as a dark-horse issue that could influence the votes of some in the crypto community. According to Cuban, the Biden administration, potentially through Gary Gensler, is failing to appeal to these voters, which could cost them the election. It is also noteworthy that Trump has recently expressed support for crypto at an NFT event, stating, "a lot of people are very much for it…and I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid…but I’m good with it. If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, you better vote for Trump." Will crypto be a deciding factor in the upcoming election? It may not be a huge issue for many Americans, but it could impact the votes of crypto enthusiasts. Read Next:

Deutsche Bank joins Singapore's asset tokenization project

Update May 14, 12:35 UTC: This article has been updated to include quotes from Interop Labs CEO Sergey GorbunovDeutsche Bank, a German multinational investment bank, is collaborating with Singapore's central bank on asset tokenization.Deutsche Bank has joined the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) Project Guardian, which focuses on asset tokenization in wholesale funding markets and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.As part of the collaboration, Deutsche Bank will test an open architecture and interoperable blockchain platform to service tokenized and digital funds. The bank will also propose protocol standards and identify the best approach to contribute to industry progress.Deutsche’s Asia Pacific head of securities and technology, Boon-Hiong Chan, will be the bank’s lead for Project Guardian. The bank is expected to work closely with Memento Blockchain, a software-based platform targeting DeFi and digital asset management. Deutsche and Memento Blockchain previously worked together in 2022 and 2023, successfully completing a proof-of-concept known as Project DAMA, which refers to Digital Assets Management Access. The initiative aims to unlock the potential for a more efficient, secure and flexible solution for digital fund management and investment servicing.The new Deutsche Bank’s efforts aim to introduce DAMA 2. The development will involve Interop Labs, the initial developer of the major interoperable blockchain, the Axelar network.Some major cryptocurrency firms, including Ripple, have been working with the Axelar Foundation to add interoperability to their blockchain networks. Ripple announced a collaboration with Axelar in February 2024, ultimately planning to tokenize real-world assets (RWA) of the XRP Ledger, made interoperable through Axelar.“It’s now clear that secure blockchain interoperability is required to unlock the trillion-dollar potential in asset tokenization,” Axelar co-founder and Interop Labs CEO Sergey Gorbunov told Cointelegraph. “Deutsche Bank and Project Guardian are leading innovation toward establishing the open systems that will enable this technology.

Developer of Tornado Cash found guilty of money laundering in the Netherlands - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Alexey Pertsev, Tornado Cash developer, found guilty of laundering $1.2B in the Netherlands.
Despite Tornado Cash being non-custodial, Pertsev sentenced to over 5 years in prison.
Verdict sparks debate on accountability of open-source developers in crypto space.

Alexey Pertsev, the founder of the cryptocurrency mixing protocol Tornado Cash, has been convicted of money laundering by Dutch judges at ‘s-Hertogenbosch court on May 14.
The ruling comes after Pertsev’s arrest in the Netherlands in August 2022. It marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of cryptocurrency technology and legal accountability.
Five years and four months in prison
Despite Tornado Cash being a non-custodial crypto mixing protocol, wherein funds passing through the platform are not held or controlled by it, Pertsev has been sentenced to five years and four months in prison for allegedly laundering a staggering $1.2 billion worth of illicit assets.
Tornado Cash gained notoriety for its ability to enhance privacy and fungibility in cryptocurrency transactions by obfuscating the origin of funds. However, its association with illicit activities led to its blacklisting by the United States government, precipitating Pertsev’s legal woes.
Despite the defence’s argument that Pertsev cannot be held accountable for the actions of Tornado Cash users due to the protocol’s decentralized nature, the court’s decision underscores the increasing scrutiny faced by developers in the crypto space.
The Tornado cash developer has a 14-days appeal window
Pertsev’s legal representatives now have 14 days to appeal the court ruling, as stakeholders across the cryptocurrency ecosystem closely monitor the outcome of this landmark case.
The verdict not only has immediate ramifications for Pertsev, but also serves as a cautionary tale for developers navigating the complex legal landscape of decentralized technologies. It raises pertinent questions about the responsibility and liability of open-source code developers in the realm of decentralized finance.
While developers typically have no direct control over the use of their code, this verdict sets a precedent that could have far-reaching implications for the broader developer community.

Roaring Kitty and Retail Traders Revive Meme Stock Frenzy with GameStop (NYSE: GME) Surge | Cryptoglobe


                                
This week, Wall Street is witnessing a resurgence in meme stock activity, reminiscent of the dramatic events surrounding GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) in 2021. 



A new wave of retail traders has significantly driven up the price of GameStop, the video game retailer that gained fame for its extraordinary rally two years ago. This rally led to widespread media coverage, including a Netflix series, a movie, and considerable financial scrutiny, culminating in heavy losses for those who failed to navigate the rapid fluctuations effectively.



So far today, in premarket trading, GameStop’s stock is enjoying a price increase of 74.4%, following a 70% jump on Monday, boosting the company’s market value by billions.

AMC Entertainment (NYSE; AMC), a movie theater chain, experienced a similar uplift, as did various lesser-known cryptocurrencies associated with Roaring Kitty and GameStop.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The revival of interest in GameStop can be traced back to Keith Gill, known online as Roaring Kitty, who returned to social media after a three-year absence. On Monday night, Gill posted a series of enigmatic video clips on his X account, sparking renewed interest in the stocks he previously championed. Despite not directly mentioning GameStop, his return triggered a flurry of activity akin to the original meme stock craze of 2021 and 2022, when stocks like GameStop and AMC saw their prices skyrocket by over 1,000%.




VIDEO




As The New York Times (NYT) reported, according to Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, investors have been buying a significant number of GameStop call options, betting on continued price increases. Sosnick noted that this surge in activity wasn’t prompted by any substantial news about GameStop or AMC but rather by the renewed attention from Roaring Kitty’s social media presence. Sosnick expressed skepticism about the sustainability of this rally, citing his past experiences with similar phenomena.



The sharp increase in GameStop’s stock price has resulted in significant losses for short sellers, who had previously bet on a decline. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of S3 Partners, told the NYT that GameStop shorts, which had accumulated $392 million in profits earlier this year, faced losses amounting to $852 million by the end of Monday.

GameStop Surges in Premarket Again, Closing in on ATH Set in 2021 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) shares surged more than 90% in premarket trading on May 14, 2024, following a remarkable 74.4% increase from the previous close on May 13.



The stock closed at $30.45 on May 13, marking the highest price in recent months and a significant deviation from the 52-week high of $38.20 and the recent low of $9.95 in the last three years. The all-time intraday high for GameStop shares was $120.75 in January 2021, with an all-time closing high of $86.88 on January 27, 2021.



Short sellers have been hit hard by the recent surge in GameStop stock prices. Estimated losses for short sellers amounted to $868 million as of May 13, 2024. These losses increased to $1.26 billion for May, with an additional $1.04 billion incurred early on May 14, pushing total monthly losses to over $2.3 billion so far.



The Return of the Meme Stock Craze



The current surge in GameStop shares is linked to the resurgence of the meme stock phenomenon reminiscent of the events that unfolded in 2021. The rally was triggered by a social media post from Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty or DeepF*ckingValue, who posted for the first time in three years on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Gill’s post included a meme indicating serious gaming, viewed over 23 million times so far.



Retail investors have been highly active on social media platforms like Reddit (NYSE: RDDT), piling into GameStop stock and call options. The increased activity from retail traders has played a significant role in driving up the stock price.





GameStop’s Short Interest Near 25% of the Free Float



GameStop’s short interest has neared 25% of the free float, the highest level since 2022. The combination of the price increase and high short interest levels signals potential further buying pressure as short sellers begin closing their positions to minimize losses.



The current rally closely echoes the 2021 saga, where retail investors drove up the prices of previously undervalued stocks. Although GameStop stock has been trending lower in recent years, the renewed interest from retail investors has led to a resurgence in its market performance.

Buy bitcoin,” CNBC reported on Tuesday.See Also: Trump’s Crypto Pivot Is Bullish…But For Whom? Mad Crypto Money With IvanMicroStrategy, led by CEO Michael Saylor, is renowned as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.

280 Million XRP Change Hands Amid Twists in the Ripple Vs SEC Case


							

Ripple’s CFO has filed a declaration supporting the firm’s motion to seal its omnibus letter motions.



A whale transferred 280 million Ripple shortly after the CFO’s filing.



XRP jumped 2.5% on Tuesday following significant whale activity.




Ripple’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Jonathan Bilich has filed a declaration in support of Ripple’s motion to seal the firm’s recently filed omnibus letter motions. Ripple filed the letter on May 13 to seal critical details regarding the remedies-related documents. Following the CFO’s filing, the XRP ecosystem experienced a significant transfer of tokens, leading to a price impact on the embattled altcoin.



Following the recent filing, onchain data reflected that nearly 280 million XRP changed hands between Ripple and a centralized exchange (CEX). According to details from the blockchain tracker Whale Alert, a crypto whale moved 279.97 XRP from an unknown wallet to an address on the Bitstamp crypto exchange. 



Whale Alert’s report showed the transaction happened in installments, with the last tranche involving a transfer of 29.97 million XRP from the unidentified wallet to Bitstamp.







The other two installments involved larger XRP volumes, as reported by Whale Alert. In the initial tranche, 150 million XRP moved from Ripple to an unknown wallet on Bitstamp. Shortly after the initial transfer, the same source sent an additional 100 million XRP to another address on the crypto exchange.



Notably, the movement of XRP tokens reflected on the altcoin’s price in the early hours of Tuesday. XRP bounced from an initial slump to post a 2.5% price rally. The embattled crypto token recovered from an initial slump, bouncing from $0.49693 to $0.50944. After a slight retracement, the top altcoin traded for $0.50544 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView.



The court case between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has experienced increased activity in the past few weeks. The increased tempo has led many crypto practitioners to believe the case is nearing a conclusion.

DMarket tops NFT charts but loses three-day streak above US$900,000


DMarket topped the non-fungible token (NFT) collection ranking on Monday with US$835,028 in daily sales. 



Despite leading the daily sales chart, Monday’s sales total snapped a three-day streak of at least US$900,000 in daily sales for DMarket.



DMarket collection represents in-game items for popular games such as Counter-Strike 2 on the Mythos network.



The collection witnessed an increase in unique buyers to 4,034 and sellers to 3,546, resulting in a total of 33,375 transactions for the day. 

	
	
	
	


This surge in daily activity has boosted DMarket’s all-time sales volume to US$427.86 million. 



While a Mythos-based project led the collections charts, the leading blockchain of the day was Bitcoin, which saw a sales volume of US$6.20 million, marking a 22% increase from the previous day’s US$5.08 million.



Bitcoin is now about US$150 million away from joining the US$4 billion club for NFT sales, and about US$400 million from catching up to Ronin, the network with the third-highest volume of all-time NFT sales.



The second and third best seller of the day came from Bitcoin.

	
	
	

	


The second-ranking collection for the day was $CORE BRC-20 NFTs. It recorded sales of US$701,305, with 251 unique buyers and 184 sellers completing 402 transactions. 



The third-ranking collection, NodeMonkes, saw daily sales of US$568,487 with 27 unique buyers and 29 sellers across 32 transactions.



NodeMonkes, became the all-time sales leader among Bitcoin collections earlier this month, has been surging up the chart. 



It recently took the 26th spot from CyberKongz and sits about US$8 million away from Crabada, the leading collection in the Avalanche network.



Other collections in Monday’s top 10 include Guild of Guardians Avatars and Solana Monkey Business, ranking fourth and fifth respectively. 



Guild of Guardians Avatars, on the Immutable network, maintained a steady performance with sales of US$535,487 and 104 transactions. 



Solana Monkey Business, on the Solana blockchain as its name suggests, recorded sales of US$472,811 with 66 unique buyers and 63 sellers.

The Captainz followed closely, ranking seventh with sales of US$345,272, rising from the previous day’s US$128,095.



The eighth position was held by Solana’s DogeZuki with sales of US$298,479, and Ethereum’s Kanpai Pandas took the ninth spot with US$288,501 in sales. 



The tenth-ranking collection was $BNB+ BRC-20 NFTs with sales of US$219,763.

Brace For Impact: Mt. Gox Set To Inject 142,000 BTC And 143,000 Bitcoin Cash Into The Market- Here’s When


																Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox is preparing to release a substantial amount of Bitcoin (BTC) into the market, signaling the upcoming disbursement of payments to creditors who had been affected by its hack attack in 2011.  
Mt. Gox Set To Release 142,000 Bitcoin Into Market
Reports from Reddit reveal that the Kraken Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) API interface have signaled that Mt. Gox is getting ready to release its substantial cryptocurrency and fiat holdings, which include 142,000 BTC and 143,000 BCH, and 69 billion yen. 

	Related Reading



As of May 13, the interface began reading “payment in preparation,” indicating that funds would soon be distributed to creditors. The date for the anticipated disbursement has also been slated for October 31, 2024. 
This decision comes after years of undergoing legal proceedings and negotiations aimed at reimbursing creditors who lost funds following the Bitcoin exchange’s crash. Earlier in 2011, Mt. Gox was hacked, resulting in the loss of 850,000 BTC now worth over $51 billion. Shortly after the unfortunate attack, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy and has since been gathering funds to compensate creditors. 
Reports from a few customers have revealed that the exchange has begun distributing funds in fiat currency. One particular Reddit user disclosed earlier in April, that he had received USD payments into an HSBC currency account with zero fees. 
While the long-awaited distribution process comes as great news to creditors, the release of such a large amount of Bitcoin could have a significant effect on the current Bitcoin market. 
Additionally, discussions about whether creditors would sell or retain their Bitcoin holdings once they receive their funds have been circulating. Nonetheless, the disbursement process presents a step towards closure and recovery for victims of the exchange’s hack and bankruptcy. 
Will Creditors Sell Or Hold?
With the Bitcoin market presently in a fragile position after experiencing a series of declines following the halving event on April 20, the possibility of a large-scale sell-off could lead to drastic changes in the market, potentially resulting in a crash. 
Commenting on Mt. Gox’s 142,000 BTC distribution plans, a Reddit community member suggested that the exchange’s upcoming repayments could become a catalyst for the next BTC dump in 2024. 

	Related Reading



In response, another Reddit user expressed doubt about the likelihood of a widespread sell-off, especially at the beginning of the bull market. The user surmised that investors who have been waiting for Mt. Gox’s payments for over a decade are unlikely to sell off their Bitcoin holdings quickly. 
Instead, he suggested that many creditors, like himself, would be more inclined to HODL their Bitcoin holdings, having acquired a deeper understanding of the pioneer cryptocurrency during the decade-long wait.

Poloniex Hacker Transfers $53.5 Million Worth of ETH Through Tornado Cash


																The movement of stolen cryptocurrency from the Poloniex hack in November 2023 is far from over. Although Poloniex claimed to have identified the attacker weeks later and offered a $10 million reward, the stolen funds were never returned.
In the latest development, PeckShield, a blockchain investigation company, found that more than half of the stolen funds were moved through Tornado Cash.
More than six months after the hack, the bad actor moved 17.8K ETH – worth approximately $53.5 million from six different wallets – to a single address of the controversial coin mixer, Tornado Cash.


The latest transfer of funds comes a week after the hacker moved more than 1,100 ETH in 11 batches of 100 ETH to the sanctioned crypto mixer over a period of two hours.




Poloniex was hacked in November 2023 after its private keys were compromised by malicious actors.
The attackers, suspected to be the notorious Lazarus Group associated with the North Korean government, stole around $126 million from the exchange’s hot wallets.
Later, Poloniex stated that its team identified and froze a portion of the assets linked to the hacker’s addresses to prevent additional losses. They also mentioned that the losses are within “manageable limits” and that their operating revenue can cover them.
TRON founder Justin Sun, who bought Poloniex in 2019, vowed to completely compensate the affected users of the exchange while asserting that it is financially stable and is seeking partnerships with other exchanges to recover the lost funds.

Bitcoin Rune etchings plummet by 99%; What's behind the dramatic fall?


In less than a month following its launch on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain, the Bitcoin Runes protocol has seen a staggering 99% drop in daily etchings, with numbers plummeting from a peak of 23,061 to just 157.
Launched on April 20 to coincide with Bitcoin’s fourth halving event, the Runes protocol initially had robust activity. However, recent data from Dune Analytics has highlighted a sharp decline, raising concerns about its sustainability and the impact on miners’ revenues.
Launched less than 30 days ago, the Bitcoin Runes has recorded a massive decline in activity. According to data sourced from Dune Analytics, the number of new Runes etched daily has sharply fallen to below 250 for the past six days, culminating in only 157 etchings recorded on Monday.

This marks a significant downturn of 99% from the late April peak when 23,061 Runes were etched in a single day. 
The protocol, launched to coincide with Bitcoin’s fourth halving event, initially sparked excitement among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. It enabled the etching of memecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and multimedia content directly onto Bitcoin’s blockchain, heralding new utility for the network.
In its first 10 days, the protocol issued more than 85,000 tokens and generated over $3 million in fees. At a time when the recent halving had reduced the block subsidy to 3.125 BTC (about $196,800 at current rates), the high volume of Runes transactions provided an essential boost to miners’ revenues.

Initially, other fees on the blockchain accounted for only 22.7% of total fees. However, the situation has since changed dramatically, with other fees now holding a share of 78.9%, while Runes account for just 21.1%.
Total miner revenue(BTC). Source: Glassnode
Finbold retrieved data from Glassnode that confirms this shift. On May 11, miners’ revenue was 533.69 BTC, a significant decline from 1677.09 BTC on April 20, which can be linked to the decreasing activity in the Runes protocol.
Over the past two weeks, all metrics—including fees, new Runes, and user activity—have dropped by more than 50%. Since May 1, only about 5,000 new Runes have been issued, generating just under $100,000 in fees.
It’s worth noting that this downturn occurred amid a general market decline, characterized by falling Bitcoin prices and slow growth in alternative tokens, which may have contributed to a drop in sentiment towards novel technology.
Market context and future prospects
Bitcoin’s On-chain activity. Source: Santiment
The decrease in Runes activity is not isolated but correlates with broader market trends. Bitcoin’s network activity has hit a five-year low, according to Santiment, indicating reduced trader interest and potential market anxiety. 
Additionally, the general sentiment towards cryptocurrency innovations like spot Bitcoin ETFs has cooled, with trading volumes declining and some funds experiencing outflows.
Despite these challenges, it’s premature to deem the Runes protocol a failure. According to Rodarmor, the inventor of Runes, speaking at a recent Ordinals event, new developments are underway that could invigorate the protocol. 
Furthermore, several Runes collections have already achieved notable market capitalizations in the millions, as per Magic Eden.
As the market anticipates upcoming economic indicators such as the US Consumer Price Index and comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the cryptocurrency sector remains vigilant. 
These economic factors could significantly influence both traditional and digital asset markets in the coming days.

Institutional ETPs Post First Inflow In Five Weeks Despite Bitcoin Price Pullback - The Defiant

Weekly ETP trade volume is down 53% compared to April.After four straight weeks of outflows, investors tentatively resumed putting money into cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs).According to CoinShares’ May 13 Digital Asset Fund Flows report, institutional digital asset investment products enjoyed an inflow of $130 million last week, averting a five-week dry spell.The move coincided with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) posting its lowest outflow since converting into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January at 171 million. GBTC hosted no inflow or outflow on May 13, further indicating that the heavy outflows consistently suffered by the fund since its conversion are waning. Nearly $17.6 billion has exited the fund since January.Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF posted the strongest inflow among spot exchange-traded funds with $111 million, followed by Ark 21Shares with $83 million, and BlackRock with $48 million.However, despite the bullish signal from institutional investors, Bitcoin (BTC) posted a 4% pullback since tagging a local high of $64,120 on May 7. The move extends a multi-month streak of downward range-bound price action, with BTC hovering between $60,000 and $70,000 since March.BTC/USD. Source: CoinGecko.Hong Kong ETF inflows crashU.S.-based ETP providers led the pack with $135 million in inflows, followed by Hong Kong and Switzerland with $19 million and $14 million worth of inflows respectively. However, Hong Kong’s performance marked a nearly 94% drawdown compared to its previous week, which hosted a $307 million inflow.“Hong Kong, after a prior week of record inflows, saw just US$19 million inflows, suggesting the majority of the first-week post-Bitcoin ETF launches were seed capital," CoinShares reported.According to Sosovalue, Hong Kong-based ETFs suffered their heaviest daily outflow on May 13 with $32 million.Ethereum ETPs post outflowsWhile Bitcoin products hosted $144 million worth of inflows, Ethereum ETPs suffered a $14.4 million outflow as analysts anticipate that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will reject the pending cohort of spot Ether ETF hopefuls.“Low interaction by the US regulators with ETF issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent," CoinShares said.The SEC is expected to provide its verdict on May 23, which coincides with the final deadline for the spot Ether application from VanEck.ETPs providing exposure to other altcoins drew modest inflows, including Solana (SOL) with $5.9 million, Polkodot (DOT) with $1.2 million, and XRP with $1.2 million.ETP volume dries upWeekly ETP trade volume trended low last week, with just $8B worth of shares changing hands. For comparison, crypto ETPs hosted $17 billion worth of weekly trades during April on average.The data likely indicates that many investors are sitting on the sidelines and awaiting the market’s next move amid tightening range-bound price action. "These volumes highlight ETP investors are participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present,” the report said.

New Meme Token Flow Stimulated the Markets! These Altcoins Are on the Rise Under the Leadership of PEPE! Will the Rise Continue? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Stock trader and analyst Keith Gill, known as “The Roaring Kitty” on social media and largely fueled the GameStop craze in late 2020, mobilized the markets with his post.
At this point, after Gill's post, the price of Roaring Kitty (KITTY), a Solana (SOL)-based meme token, and the altcoin named GME, which is known for the GameStop project but has nothing to do with the project, recorded tremendous increases.


However, the rising effect did not stop with these two altcoins and popular meme tokens also revived. In this context, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) and cat-themed tokens Popcat (POPCAT) and Mog (MOG) have experienced double-digit price increases in the last 24 hours.
Such movement was interpreted as an early sign that risk appetite was returning to crypto markets after weeks of stagnant markets.





According to CoinMarketCap data, in the top 100 cryptocurrencies ranking, PEPE is at the top among the most profitable altcoins with a rise of 21%, while FLOKI is at the top with 12.8%; DOGE 5%; BOME 11%; POPCAT rose 23.9% and MOG rose 25.6%.



Speaking to Coindesk, MOG token developer Shisui said:

“Roaring Kitty is living proof that retail can outperform (outperform) corporations at the highest level.
Its return was perceived as a bullish signal for meme tokens as the market remembered that much of the Gamestop frenzy in 2021 spilled over into DOGE and other meme coins.
While we are far from being in a truly risky environment, price action following the return of Roaring Kitty points to which assets will perform better once bullish conditions return.
“The market has shown itself and wants MOG.”

Apart from MOG founder, Floki lead developer B also evaluated the rise.






“The crypto industry is just starting to realize that meme tokens are fun, relatable, and represent the average person.
The vast majority of retail investors are flocking to meme coins. This group of investors is tired and ignores old crypto projects.
“Although many people are concerned about meme tokens because they do not have enough information about meme tokens, I have predicted years ago that there will be strong interest in meme tokens.”

Paul Grewal criticizes SEC's approach in Coinbase case following Debt Box mishandling

Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, Paul Grewal, charged the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with moving from a traditional Wells notice process to penalizing the company for their case against Coinbase. Grewal’s criticism is a reaction to a disclosure of the SEC’s failure to use its routine procedures in a similar bankruptcy case involving Debt Box.Coinbase CLO questions SEC actionsIn a current X posting, Grewal pinpointed an important weakness of the SEC’s methodology. He noted that the SEC did not follow its usual Wells procedures for Coinbase. The typical Wells procedure involves the SEC submitting a comprehensive justification of the facts that led to the proposed charges. Nonetheless, Grewal showed the Coinbase authorities that they still needed to hear from them which assets they deemed securities.Grewal’s statement was broadcast after the SEC filed a lawsuit on Debt Box. The SEC has stated that its staff’s “usual practice is to set forth an adequate description of the evidence”. Given this admittance, the SEC’s enforcement proceedings have come under scrutiny for their justice and openness. In Grewal’s opinion, the SEC’s absence of details as to the composition of the assets under question creates a serious question mark on the honesty of its claims against Coinbase.The case of Coinbase getting a lawsuit filed against them by the SEC in June last year is an example. SEC claimed that the company engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities since 2019. This legal fight remains to be sorted, and just recently, the SEC sought the court to reject Coinbase’s appeal against the litigation. Critics of the SEC attack the agency’s actions as an instance of the SEC overstepping its authority. Some argue that the SEC should not be involved in crypto companies’ investigations.A judge of the federal district court in Utah said in March that the SEC was poor in handling the Debt Box case. The judge used the words “gross abuse” along with “power misuse” to describe the SEC’s actions and emphasized the fact that this case was marred by “false statements” and “misrepresentation.” The criticism of the SEC’s strategy has become stronger. The resignation of two SEC attorneys who led the prosecution of Debt Box has raised even more doubts about the legitimacy of the case.SEC enforcement faces growing industry backlashSeveral industry figures have criticized the SEC’s approach to enforcement. Rodrigo Silva-Herzog, a special counsel at Cooley LLP, stated that the SEC’s move was comparable to carpet bombing and showed that they intended to kill anything that might be crypto. Hayden Adams, the Founder of Uniswap, also reiterated this opinion, chastising the SEC for criminalizing the industry’s “remarkable individuals” rather than populating standards with which these players could work.The SEC has adopted a strong and enforcement-oriented position that has been met with growing criticisms regarding the lack of disclosure. Top industry people advocate that the current regulatory framework is counterproductive, marking a threat to crypto innovation and businesses operating in this field. Well-defined rule-making and regulation formation will encourage an environment in which the industry can flourish instead of being crushed.These past legal cases against Coinbase, Debt Box, and other digital currency enterprises epitomize the broader difficulties that the sector is experiencing. The absence of definite regulation frameworks is a key problem, which may put companies in a far-reaching situation of enforcement proceedings accused of being prejudicial or unclear.

Coinbase 'on top of it' despite withdrawals not processing


Coinbase users claim they can’t withdraw their funds from the world’s second largest exchange despite it announcing it had ‘fully recovered’ after a system-wide outage.
The platform suffered the three-hour-long outage on Monday but in the early hours of Tuesday, it claimed to have resolved the problem and apologized for the inconvenience. 
However, a slew of users on X (formerly Twitter) have responded to the recovery announcement claiming that they still can’t withdraw their funds. 
According to one user, “It’s not fixed, withdrawals are not available!!,” while another posted “@X can we get community notes here. This tweet is false as millions of people are still unable to withdraw or transfer their assets.”

Coinbase told users, “We are aware that some users may still experience issues while sending cryptocurrency or withdrawing fiat. Our team is on top of it.”
The latest ‘degraded transactions’ update from the exchange’s status page was posted at 02:58 PDT, and said, “We are continuing to investigate this issue.”
When asked to explain the situation, Coinbase told Protos, ”Some users may still experience failures when sending crypto or withdrawing fiat.
“We are continuing to investigate this issue and will provide an update shortly. Rest assured, funds are safe.” Coinbase failed to comment further on what caused the previous outage.

CoinShares’ AUM Tops $6B Following Valkyrie ETF Acquisition - DailyCoin


        

CoinShares has released its Q1 2024 Report.



The company posted impressive gains.



The development comes after the acquisition of Valkyrie’s ETF business.




Digital asset investment firm CoinShares has reported billions in assets under management (AUM) and a record surge in revenue, gains, and other income in its Q1 earnings report.



The impressive results come after CoinShares acquired Valkyrie’s ETF business on March 12, inheriting the fund’s $530M in assets under management. This acquisition enhanced CoinShares’ global presence and operational footprint across the Atlantic.



Record Q1 Earnings



According to the report published on May 14, CoinShares witnessed a 216% year-over-year surge in revenue, gains, and other income in the first quarter of 2024. The earnings totaled £43.9 million ($55 million), up from £13.9 million ($17.4 million) during the same period last year.




The company’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) stood at £34.2 million ($42.9 million), up over fourfold compared to 2023 Q1 results.



Notably, CoinShares’ total comprehensive income grew from £2.9 million ($3.6 million) in 2023 Q1 to £34.1 million ($42.8 million) in 2021 Q1.



$6B in AUM



The firm’s AUM topped £4.77 billion ($6 billion), with £3.82 billion ($4.8 billion) held on its balance sheet relating to ETFs issued by CoinShares Digital Securities Limited and XBT Provider. The remaining £0.95 billion ($1.2 billion) is held in the newly acquired funds from Valkyrie and the BLOCK index.




CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti lauded the report, noting that it reflected its commitment to growth and excellence.



“This quarter reflects not only our robust financial performance but also highlights our enhanced strategic growth capabilities, exemplified by the successful acquisition of Valkyrie's ETF business in March 2024,” Mognetti said in a statement.  



Per the statement, 2021 Q1 represented CoinShares’ “strongest quarter ever.”

Empire Newsletter: It’s memecoins all the way down - Blockworks


Memecoins show the way
What are brand-new projects to do in such a topsy-turvy market, one that’s either teetering on the brink of altcoin season or about to veer off into another crypto winter?
It’s been about seven months since a fake news tweet from Cointelegraph pushed crypto into overdrive. The market is clearly still confused.
The salacious tweet — which reported that the SEC had approved spot bitcoin ETFs for US markets — confirmed a major bitcoin rally that had been brewing all through 2023.
Bitcoin surged by two-thirds in the months between the post and official SEC approval in early January, and then by another 80% after the fact.
Crypto has since been outright messy. Memecoin, DePIN and computing marketplace projects have pumped, privacy coins have dumped, and ETH is stuck in no-man’s land awaiting approval of its own spot ETFs a la BlackRock’s IBIT.
As Jason touches on in today’s Empire podcast episode, creative ways of issuing new tokens have emerged between this cycle and the last. 
Startups and protocol stewards commonly run private token sales in funding rounds with venture capitalists — which apparently don’t piss off the SEC — before airdropping slices of the circulating supply to users and other early adopters (read: those pesky airdrop farmers).
No ICO means no SEC lawsuits, the thinking goes, while the supply ends up with folks who actively use the protocols they power. Seems like a win-win.
A byproduct of this New Style of doing crypto business is that token supplies are often drip-dropped into the market over a number of years. It’s now relatively routine for tokens to launch with less than 25% of the supply circulating — and in some cases much less. 
The rest is kept by the team, early backers and other insiders to fund development, marketing and, eventually, provide ROI. What results is a number of low-float tokens with massively high fully-diluted valuations compared to their actual market caps, a blueprint largely perfected by Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda Research with Serum and other “Sam Coins.”
It all begs the question of whether there’s any correlation between price performance and low-float supply dynamics. 
There are individual cases: dYdX, for instance, had only 18% of the supply circulating when Cointelegraph’s fake news tweet confirmed the bitcoin bull market and has since released an additional 34% of the supply. dYdX’s price against bitcoin has collapsed by more than half in that time. 
The airdropped Starknet token is another — it only has 7.3% circulating supply and its bitcoin ratio has also halved.
But after analyzing the current top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, as well as another two dozen or so tokens featured in the top 100 just before the bitcoin bull run really kicked off, broader correlation is harder to find.
Tokens at the top of the chart have high floats. Tokens to the right of the dotted line have beaten bitcoin. Brighter circles have increased their supplies more than darker ones. And larger circles have grown bigger market caps.
The cluster in the top left shows even the highest-float tokens have found it hard to beat bitcoin
After removing a few outliers, about 40% of the top end of the market have outperformed bitcoin since October. At that time, the median circulating supply for tokens that have gone onto beat bitcoin was 70%. For underperformers, it was 79%. Not exactly a huge difference. Low float cryptocurrencies generally did as well as high floats.
Then, the median performance against bitcoin for tokens with circulating supplies of 80% or more was minus 21%. So, high-float tokens appear just as susceptible to losing significant ground as low-floats.
Even projects with some of the lowest floats — 19 tokens with under 25% of the supply circulating — on average have beaten BTC by 25%, while the median was almost 1% ahead.
But for standout performers, there does appear to be a link. Bitcoin ratios of nearly a dozen top cryptocurrencies have more than tripled since October. Their median circulating supply was 94% before the rally.
All those stars were memecoins and DePIN projects, which aside from Bittensor, all had a large majority of their supplies already circulating. 
A great irony of crypto in 2024 is that perhaps, it’s time to treat memecoin launches as the new standard moving forward. 
And of course, WIF blows them all out of the water

Solana (a layer-1) and Uniswap (a DEX) are neck-and-neck for fees generated in the past seven days — both $10 million.
Ethereum only has 174 validators waiting in the queue, down from more than 22,000 this time last month. Active validators were at an all-time high yesterday: 1,014,915.
Bitcoin transactions are more than 80% standard BTC transfers, plugging the gap left by lower interest in Runes and Ordinals.
Pepe’s leading the memestocks, gaining 18% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.
GameStop’s stock is above $65 in premarket trading, on pace to shatter its 52-week high of $38.

The return of Keith Gill, the man behind the powerful online persona, sent memestocks and memecoins soaring on Monday. 
We were left asking one big question: Is history repeating itself? The answer is…maybe? 
We’re nowhere near the 2021 memestock mania, when GameStop’s stock rose to new heights. And it’s not just the retail investors who benefited from the memestock focus either back then or right now. 
Pepe, Dogecoin, FLOKI, Dogwifhat and, of course, some random GME-themed memecoins (with no affiliation with the company) gained after Roaring Kitty posted a video suggesting his return.
That’s not even mentioning that GameStop’s market cap is back over $9 billion, or that the stock closed up 74% on Monday. AMC, another memestock favorite, closed up 78%.
A number of factors made 2021 unique. I’m not saying it’s impossible in this cycle, but the threads may be more similar instead of the exact same.
Memecoins dominate today’s market narrative, whereas 2021 saw NFTs booming — nowadays, not so much. 
There are macro differences, too. Zooming out of crypto, interest rates are sky high with the Federal Reserve holding on to the 5.25%-and-5.50% range since the summer of 2023. Inflation still runs rampant. Retail investors simply aren’t seeing the same economic environment, not to mention the pandemic that was still a thing in 2021. 
Back then, interest rates were so low that millennials could actually afford to buy houses.
The point is: We’re not coming out of lockdown, and we’re seeing crypto bounce back with some weakness after a rough bear market. Of course, that’s not going to stop folks who want to jump into either the memestocks or memecoins. But the conditions don’t look to be ripe enough for a repeat. 
Just remember: Diamond hands may be forever, but these cycles tend to have a short — and volatile — lifespan.

The Morning Riff
Here’s an interesting find: Speculators on the prediction market Polymarket seem to be giving US President Joe Biden similar chances at victory than challenger Donald Trump in a new, major national poll. 
On Polymarket right now — in a market that has earned more than $125 million worth of bets — Trump leads Biden 49% to 44%. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., meanwhile, pulls a mere 3% — one percentage point less than Michelle Obama, wife of former president Barack Obama.

Let’s look at the new New York Times poll from this week.
Trump leads in an array of battleground states, per the Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer poll. In two of those states, Trump pulls 49% to Biden’s 42%. Biden fares best in Wisconsin, pulling 47% to Trump’s 45%. 
Interestingly, RFK Jr. polled around 10% in each of the battleground states — a marker of strength for the independent candidate and much stronger than what the folks on Polymarket are saying. 
The polls and prediction market aren’t moving in tandem, but at some points, they rhyme. To be sure, the crypto-powered Polymarket has been giving Trump strong chances for months. But it’s a fascinating lens for a major political matchup — I’ll be watching as the bets continue to develop. Stay tuned.

Is the meme coin mania back to crypto?


Meme coins are trending in the cryptocurrency market after a month of low activity. Renewed interest surged when the famous meme trader Keith Gill returned to social platforms on May 13. Gill, known as Roaring Kitty, inspired the GameStop (NYSE: GME) short squeeze in 2021 and a following Dogecoin (DOGE) pump.
Data from Santiment’s SanBase Pro, Vinicius Barbosa, for Finbold on May 14 shows a recent meme coin trend taking shape. In particular, PEPE leads the charge among today’s trending coins, followed by FLOKI, DOGE, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and dogwifhat (WIF).

Notably, the Ethereum-based meme token of Pepe The Frog has surged over 21% in the last 24 hours at $0.000011. It is a similar level reached in early March due to a massive meme coin boom. Moreover, PEPE’s social dominance (bars) has jumped to record highs of 2.46% of the market’s overall social interest.


Other meme coins have not followed PEPE’s price action yet. However, as these coins trend in social indicators, traders wonder if the meme coin mania is back to cryptocurrency trading.

Roaring Kitty’s return: GameStop and meme coin mania
Roaring Kitty, a pseudonymous for Keith Gill, reactivated his X (formerly Twitter) account after three years of idle. Sided with its last post from June 18, 2021, the account’s timeline shows the meme of a ‘gamer’ taking an active position to start playing on May 12.

Interestingly, on Monday, GameStop’s stock jumped 45% the day after Gill’s mysterious activity. GME trades at $30.45 as its last known price. However, a CNBC report highlights a 130% surge in today’s pre-market, with GameStop dominating the stock market attention.
Since then, Roaring Kitty has continued posting a series of mysterious videos, which cryptocurrency and stock traders are eagerly trying to decode in an attempt to identify the next meme coin pump—similar to what happened in 2021 after the event with GameStop.
Related words have dominated Santiment‘s trending feed: “gme, gamestop, kitty, and roaring.”

In this context, it is worth the warning that trading meme coins or meme stocks can be extremely risky. The risk of ruin with this asset class is high.
Furthermore, experts warn of “The Greater Fool” theory dynamics that resemble financial bubbles, when the “mania” disappears and the late buyers remain with massive losses of assets that have no organic demand besides the highly speculative nature of traders trying to outplay the market, but being outplayed as soon as the “music stops.”

Floki Inu (FLOKI) Recovers Close to Monthly High, Extends Meme Token Trend | Cryptopolitan

Floki Inu (FLOKI) is up alongside other meme tokens. FLOKI represents doge-themed assets and is one platform that aims to onboard Web3 activities and gaming. FLOKI went up close to its monthly high, reaching $0.0001894 with nearly 10% daily gains. FLOKI marks a second round of the meme token trend, repeating its all-time high from 2021-2022. The asset trades at a higher baseline, gaining support from new enthusiasm for memes. FLOKI Gets Boost from Token Burn ProposalLike other meme tokens, FLOKI relies on a mix of holders and burns to diminish the token supply and move to a higher valuation. The DAO approach means voting for the FLOKI community to decide on the token burn. The news made FLOKI a trending asset based on social media discussions. When meme tokens traded differently than other assets, they started paying more attention to FLOKI. The recent addition of FLOKI to the Van Eck meme coin index adds to the exposure. The positive performance of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) is adding to FLOKI’s improved profile. In the coming months, FLOKI will add a Telegram trading bot, making the asset even more accessible. Additionally, the team at FLOKI will burn the bot fees to decrease the token supply further. FLOKI will also add a DNS service similar to Ethereum addresses to boost adoption and popularity.FLOKI Bets on Gaming Once AgainOne reason for FLOKI’s crash was the end of the play-to-earn boom. From the beginning, the creators envisioned FLOKI as more than just a token but also a fuel asset for a gaming ecosystem. But the outflow of players meant FLOKI traded sideways for years, erasing 99% of its value. FLOKI is revamping its game strategy, offering a mix of social media exposure and a growing game environment. The Heimdall Ascends game issued a new patch with improved performance. The Valhalla game is now trying to revive its player base. The Valhalla NFT was among the most successful during the boom of 2021, but it had a very limited presence on OpenSea in 2024. But this year, Valhalla may rise again, as Floki Inu plans to launch two mainnet versions and a mobile version scheduled for the end of the year. The FLOKI token may also become part of FinTech activities by allowing FLOKI spending. For now, Floki Inu is in the process of securing banking services for the crypto-to-fiat ramp.Multiple Uses Still Possible for FLOKIFLOKI aims to offer multiple utilities in addition to its central game product, Valhalla. The Floki Inu platform offers TokenFi and DeFi options. Additionally, Floki Inu lists its own Valhalla NFT in a native marketplace. Users can also spend the FLOKI token through a debit card. Additionally, FLOKI recently gained more exposure on Binance Pay, with a dedicated profile page. The Floki Inu platform has also added educational tools and allows users to stake the FLOKI asset for additional passive income. FLOKI has no maximum supply and nearly 10B tokens in circulation, so any locked or staked tokens help boost the market price. FLOKI also aims to grow its influence on Binance Venus, currently listed in an isolated pool. FLOKI decentralized trading still locks $2.7B in assets, but the project aims to become part of the Venus Core and draw in additional liquidity. The FLOKI token has a relatively small holder pool of around 78K wallets, around 30% of the holders of PEPE. Despite this, FLOKI aims to become the most known meme asset with additional utility. The recent trend of meme tokens showed that the leading assets with some history are the best performers. New meme tokens may be launched almost all the time, but only a handful rise to the top of the charts. FLOKI is among those tokens, boosted by an older, recognizable brand and a strong community.

Chain of Alliance Beta Launch Brings ‘Ground Up’ Overhaul - Decrypt

Blockchain-powered role-playing game (RPG) Chain of Alliance has launched its beta version, making “massive changes” to its game systems and overhauling its visuals and UI.“In general we’ve revamped most of the game for the better,” Chain of Alliance Marketing Lead Jorn Wisman told Decrypt. “We have made massive changes on our beta build vs the alpha build.”Those changes include “reworked” game progression, combat, and crafting systems, a “redesigned” UI, and an updated quest system as well as “all new” animations, VFX and audio.Chain of Alliance’s combat mechanics have been reworked “from the ground up,” Wisman said, with the aim of creating a flexible system that enables new skills and updates to be easily added. As well as ensuring that the game can be kept “fresh and exciting” with the addition of new classes, the rework also gives players more options for specialization while they embark on the character creation process.A new Aspects mechanic, meanwhile, adds random properties to equipment, buffing the player’s stats and enabling more granular customization by engraving Runes on equipment with Aspects.Equipment can now be Engraved. Image: Chain of AllianceSkill mechanics have been tweaked to be more “purposeful,” Wisman said, adding that players now have the choice of using new Taunt, Shield and Block skills that add layers of play and counter-play to the game.For example, the Taunt move forces the opposing team to attack the Taunting Hero, enabling one of the player’s other characters to heal or stack effects for a more devastating attack.Skills add new dynamics to combat. Image: Chain of AllianceNew art, animations and VFX have been added to give the game more visual polish. “The early version was heavily impacted by the limitations of the technology of a web game, but we are constantly trying to push it to the very edge of what’s possible,” Wisman told Decrypt, with improvements to the game’s designs and a complete overhaul of in-game battle animations helping to give it a look that’s “unique in the crypto games space.”Heroes boast new animations. Image: Chain of AllianceThe team is particularly proud of the visual upgrades to the arenas, he added, noting that, “They are all vibrant and unique, making each battle that much more exciting.”As well as refreshing the game’s graphics, the Chain of Alliance beta also overhauls its UI, optimizing its interface for computer browsers rather than mobile devices. “We have focused a lot on user experience and having a consistent style throughout the game,” Wisman said, adding that its combat is “a lot more interactive,” in order to help players make better informed decisions during gameplay.That’s particularly important given the complex systems such as crafting and engraving that have been added to the game with its beta launch. “Overall, the UI is just a lot more intuitive, and easier to understand for our new players,” Wisman said.What is Chain of Alliance?Launched in February 2022, Chain of Alliance is an immersive turn-based, party-builder RPG, whose game world expands driven by the choices and actions from the community.An overhauled UI enhances combat. Image: Chain of AllianceHeroes are the core asset of Chain of Alliance, created by players using components like the head, torso, and arms. Each component is imbued with unique attributes, and further customized through the Hero’s species, class assignments, the player’s choice of equipment, and the new Aspects and Engraving mechanics introduced in the beta launch.Heroes can be minted as NFTs, with their progression recorded directly on the NFT. "We want to give traditional gamers that love RPG games the option to own their digital assets and not be chained to the developer as they are now," Chain of Alliance co-founder Simon Sorgenfrei told Decrypt.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

GameStop's 250% Revival Boosts Memecoins, 2021 Glory Returns - DailyCoin


        
GameStop stock is rising, triggering expectations of a 2021 repeat.



Crypto memecoins are moving in tandem with GME’s surge.



Some are warning that GameStop’s revival is a pump and dump in the making.
The GameStop short squeeze of January 2021 was an inflection point that captured the world’s attention. Sparked by user posts on Reddit, a coordinated effort by retail traders to buy up shares of the struggling video game retailer triggered a mind-boggling 2,400% surge in the stock over a month, with the price peaking at $121. The David vs. Goliath narrative spun a moment of people’s power defeating the greedy, immoral Wall Street hedge funds that had been massively shorting GameStop. This movement spilled over into crypto, with Dogecoin benefiting from a whopping 8,200% jump to an all-time high of $0.74. With GameStop stock stirring again, memecoin investors wonder if history will repeat itself.Memecoins Enjoy BoostMemecoins are riding high in tandem with GameStop’s unexpected stock price revival, prompting expectations of a repeat of the frenzy witnessed in 2021. Over the last 24 hours, the total memecoin market capitalization grew 7.4% to $54.5 billion.
The top three memecoins showed modest gains, with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu up 4.5% and 1.1%, respectively, except for Pepe, which recorded a huge 21.8% increase in price over the period. Leading memecoins per CoinGeckoHowever, the top-performing memecoin was GME, growing 270% to $0.01147 over the past day. GME is a Solana-based token that is not associated with the GameStop company. Instead, GME “pays homage to the GameStop saga anniversary” and plays on the David vs. Goliath narrative to show “we can stand up to the big guys together.”Commenting on current market dynamics, investor Satoshi Stacker wondered whether memecoins are primed to explode in parallel with GameStop stock. X influencer “intuitio” seemed to think so, stating that the rising GameStop stock price signals that people’s power is readying to battle “men in suits with resources” once more.
With GameStop stock recording a massive jump since May, both stock and crypto markets are poised for action. GameStop Manipulation?GameStop stock has seen a massive 250% trough-to-peak jump since the start of May, recording a 91-week high of $38.32 on Monday. The pre-market trading price is currently above Monday’s close at $42.47, indicating a wave of eager buying is underway, fueled by heavy media coverage of GameStop’s unexpected revival.GME daily chart per Trading ViewHelping fuel the frenzy, Keith Gill, known as “Roaring Kitty” and an instrumental figure rallying investors during the 2021 mania, reactivated his long-dormant Twitter account on Monday after a nearly 3-year hiatus. He posted a picture of a man leaning forward intently and has been tweeting regularly since.However, not everyone is buying the people’s power narrative. X influencer Gary Gensler (Parody) warned that corporate interests are likely behind the scenes manipulating investors into another “pump and dump” scheme of GameStop stock. Gary Gensler (Parody) cautioned not to “fall for it,” urging his followers to seek professional financial advice over internet randoms.Trader “HORSE” took a similarly skeptical approach to Gary Gensler (Paradoy), predicting that the GME hype would soon die down, which he based on the lack of short interest compared to the levels seen in 2021. On the Flipside
The strength of Dogecoin‘s move in 2021 created a flood of copycat clones and kicked off memecoins as a recognized category of cryptocurrency.



An SEC report in the 2021 GME frenzy found that many hedge funds were long, contradicting what was reported in the media.



Over 1,300 memecoins now exist, meaning a repeat of Dogecoin‘s unreal 2021 performance is harder to achieve as capital is spread thinner.



GameStop cut staff and crypto projects in December 2022.
Why This MattersBeyond the stirring memecoin-GameStop hype is the issue of market manipulation and retail investors being set up for a fall. While it’s still in the early stages, with the potential for a 2021 repeat, it should be clear that participating in the hopes of timing the top is a high-risk strategy.Raj Gokal dismisses claims memecoins are a net negative for the industry:Solana Founder Sneers at Claims of Memecoin Scaring BuildersPaolo Ardoino responds to rumors that the SEC is coming for Tether:Tether CEO Dismisses SEC Probe Rumors as Malicious FUD

BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Secures Massive $99M Investment From Wisconsin State | Bitcoinist.com


								Institutional investors and US states are displaying heightened interest in the Bitcoin ETF market following regulatory approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January. 
The latest development reveals that Wisconsin’s investment board has invested approximately $100 million in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.
US States Eye Bitcoin ETF Market
According to a recent 13F form filed with the SEC, the Wisconsin investment board acquired $98.6 million worth of shares in the BlackRock ETF. 
This significant investment contributes to BlackRock’s growing presence in the newly regulated market, which has experienced a substantial increase in inflows and trading volume since January.

In addition, demonstrating the growing interest of US states in exploring opportunities to invest in the Bitcoin ETF market, Keith Ammon, New Hampshire State Representative and Vice Chair of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, recently initiated a discussion on diversifying the state’s financial reserves by investing in Bitcoin ETFs. 
BTC ETFs Poised For Expansion?
As reported by Bitcoinist on Monday, Ammon’s analysis highlights the potential benefits. It states that if New Hampshire had allocated just 5% ($4.65 million) of its 2016 rainy day fund to Bitcoin, it would now be worth nearly half a billion dollars ($473 million), representing a substantial 10,000% return on investment.
Ammon also references Manuel Nordeste, Fidelity’s Vice President of Digital Assets, who emphasizes the growing trend among major pension funds and big banks towards allocating funds to spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
Nordeste’s insights reveal that 25% of pension managers personally own digital assets, indicating a significant shift in interest within the digital asset market. 
Ammon suggests that if only 1% of state pension assets under management ($5.5 trillion) were to flow into Bitcoin, it would surpass mining revenue, creating a supply shortage relative to demand and driving further price increases for Bitcoin.

In sum, these developments underscore the increasing appeal of Bitcoin ETFs to institutional investors and US states alike. With continued regulatory approval and growing interest, the Bitcoin ETF market seems to be poised to experience further expansion in the coming months.

What's next for Solana memecoins as GameStop causes historic surge? - AMBCrypto



GME led the Solana memecoins gainers chart.
dogwifhat and Popcat were other assets that saw significant price increases.

Solana memecoins experienced a recent surge, largely fueled by a single post. Among them, the GameStop token [GME] took the lead in driving the uptrend despite previously exhibiting a stagnant performance.
 Other memecoins on the Solana [SOL] network, such as dogwifhat [WIF], Bonk [BONK], and Popcat [POPCAT] have also benefited from the positive trends currently observed in SOL memecoins.
Roaring Kitty sets Solana memecoins rolling
A post made by the social media account “Roaring Kitty” on the 13th of May triggered notable movements in Solana memecoins. 
“Roaring Kitty” is the account of Keith Gill, a trader whose videos have previously influenced spikes in memecoin values, particularly in GameStop (GME).
How GME reacted
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the GameStop (GME) price movement revealed a significant surge on the 13th of May. The GME value skyrocketed by over 1,600%, reaching $0.009 from around $0.0005. 
This surge marked an all-time high for GME, which was setting another record at the time of the analysis. As of this writing, it was trading at around $0.01, indicating a further increase of over 20%. 
Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated a strong bear trend, with the RSI over 80, signaling an overbought condition.

Despite the surge, sustaining momentum might require further increases in volume. Nevertheless, GME emerged as the highest gainer among Solana memecoins within the last 24 hours.
Popcat and dogwifhat share the memecoin uptrend
Analysis of the Solana memecoins rankings revealed that Popcat was another notable gainer in the past 24 hours. 
Popcat’s chart indicated a gain of over 16.5% on the 13th of May, with its trading price reaching around $0.48. As of this writing, it was trading at almost $0.5, marking a further increase of over 3%. 
Similar to GME, Popcat’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggested a bull trend.

Meanwhile, dogwifhat also experienced gains, although less substantial than GME and Popcat. On 13th May, dogwifhat recorded a gain of over 1%, trading at around $3. Presently, it was trading at slightly over $3, reflecting an increase of over 2%. Despite its smaller gains, Dogwifhat remained the largest Solana memecoin with a market capitalization exceeding $3 billion.

Ethereum's Underperformance Against Bitcoin, Solana Means It 'Will Need More Demand Sources,' Says Trader - Benzinga

Pseudonymous trader Evanss6 shared his thoughts on Ethereum’s ETH/USD recent underperformance, the challenges it faces on multiple fronts and the potential catalysts that could drive its future growth and adoption.What Happened: The trader acknowledges Ethereum’s poor trading performance over the past year, with its local top against the Bitcoin BTC/USD trading pair occurring around the Merge in late 2022. In the past year, ETH accumulated 62% gains compared to Bitcoin's 130% and Solana's SOL/USD 600%.Despite the favorable supply dynamics resulting from the "triple halving," the trader attributes ETH’s underperformance to a less favorable imbalance between buyers and sellers compared to competitors like BTC and SOL.The trader points out that Ethereum was an extremely consensus position at the time of the Merge, with widespread ownership and usage across various crypto sectors. However, since then, Ethereum has been losing ground on three fronts: competition from Bitcoin, Solana and regulatory challenges.Also Read: The Dencun Dilemma: Can Lower Fees Derail Ethereum’s Deflationary Ambitions And Dampen Prospects Of A Price Surge?Bitcoin's Real Tradfi Acceptance, Solana's Meme Coin FrenzyBitcoin has gained real TradFi acceptance through ETF approval, taken NFT share via ordinals and developed its ecosystem of “L2s.”Solana, on the other hand, has already priced in the worst, caught up in various metrics, become the primary platform for meme coin trading, and achieved consensus status. "Solana is now consensus. That doesn’t mean it’s bad. It’s just no longer contrarian like it was from $10 to $30 or so," Evanss6 states, adding that he plans to continue holding SOL as a top position until he sees a reason not to.Regulatory ChallengesEthereum faces challenges as the SEC investigates its security status, the market has priced out spot ETH ETF approval, and the Biden administration’s stance on stablecoins and crypto appears unfavorable.Evanss6 highlights several positive developments for Ethereum despite the challenges it faces.Ethereum's NeedThe trader believes that Ethereum will need more demand sources, with the ETF being a major step towards unlocking new capital flows. He emphasized the importance of continued L1 optimizations and a coherent narrative around "programmable money" and "institutional-grade tokenization platform."What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.

XRP Legal Battle Update: Ripple's Motion to Seal Documents


							

Ripple is attempting to preserve critical business information in its legal battle with the SEC, underlining possible dangers to its connections and market status.



The ruling of Ripple’s case against the SEC could set a precedent for how digital assets are regulated.



Despite legal challenges, Ripple’s XRP remains stable in price and trading volume, indicating resilience.




James K. Filan, a defense lawyer, claimed that Ripple, the blockchain firm that created the XRP cryptocurrency, has filed a motion to seal some of the documents related to its ongoing legal case with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).







The request aims to safeguard sensitive details such as financial statements and business connections from public exposure. Moreover, Ripple asserted that the redacted information would not significantly impact the court’s decision-making process regarding the motion for Judgment and Remedies.



The SEC did not object to Ripple’s request to seal certain materials, but it did question others. Ripple’s Chief Financial Officer, Jonathan Bilich, emphasized the need to preserve sensitive business information, warning that disclosure might harm Ripple’s commercial relationships and competitive position. 







The classification of XRP has led to litigation between Ripple and the SEC. The SEC alleges it is a security and has accused Ripple of violating the securities laws by selling it without registration. Ripple argues against this, claiming that XRP is a cryptocurrency rather than a security.



The court’s judgment in this case could be a turning point for Ripple and the other cryptocurrencies as well. If the SEC wins, Ripple may be fined seriously and will have to follow the securities regulations. On the other hand, if Ripple is victorious, it would be proof that it has achieved something remarkable in the market, and hence, its standing would be boosted. Moreover, a win for Ripple would be the first among the digital assets to be treated as such.









Meanwhile, amid the legal proceedings, 280 million XRP tokens were observed moving within the Ripple ecosystem and a cryptocurrency exchange. The transactions were noted as Ripple appealed to seal documents related to the SEC’s Motion for Judgment and Remedies. Notably, renowned XRP whale addresses were involved in the transfers, sparking interest within the cryptocurrency community.







XRP is priced at $0.50 and has maintained stability, with a trading volume exceeding $900 million in the last 24 hours. Over this period, it has seen a gain of 1.81%, bringing its market valuation to more than $28 billion.

Alexey Pertsev found guilty of money laundering, faces 64 months in prison - Blockworks


A Dutch court found Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev guilty on Tuesday, sentencing him to 64 months in prison. 
Pertsev was accused of laundering $1.2 billion of crypto through Tornado Cash, per an indictment earlier this year. He stood trial back in March. 
“The court concludes that the suspect consciously accepted the significant chance that the charged Ether resulting from a crime was deposited in [crypto system], as a result of which he was guilty of laundering it,” a translated version of the ruling said. 
“In view of all this, the court was of the opinion that it was foreseeable from the start that Ether resulting from crime would be deposited in [crypto system] due to the concealing effect of [crypto system]. This has actually happened frequently and to a large extent. Concealment has de facto always been a core activity of [crypto system],” the ruling continued.

Pertsev’s conviction comes as the US also looks to crack down on Tornado Cash. Government officials sanctioned Tornado Cash in 2022, and last year, the US publicly targeted two co-founders of Tornado Cash — Roman Storm and Roman Semenov — and charged them with money laundering and sanctions violations. Storm was arrested, though Semenov remains at large. 
Semenov’s known email addresses and Ethereum wallet addresses were added to OFAC’s list last August.

Storm is expected to face a trial in the US later this year. CoinCenter’s head of research Peter Van Valkenburgh said that the outcome shouldn’t impact Storm’s trial later this year. 

“Some of this would be highly questionable under US constitutional law. Unlike in the SDNY case that focuses primarily on ongoing activities of the defendants, the Dutch ruling seems to come straight out and say that you can be criminally responsible merely for inventing a crypto system,” Van Valkenburgh said in a post on X. 
Van Valkenburgh penned a note earlier this month on how the Department of Justice had turned its nose to previous guidance from the Treasury Department’s FinCEN on money transmitters, according to legal documents filed in the case against the Tornado Cash developers and also its case against Samourai Wallet.

Coinbase outage hampers Bitcoin trading amid price swings


The largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase experienced a system-wide outage on Tuesday, disrupting user access amid fluctuating Bitcoin prices. 



The outage, impacting both the website and mobile app, presented users with a “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” error. 



Coinbase announced a full recovery after around four hours.







The timing of the outage was particularly problematic for traders, coinciding with notable Bitcoin price changes and raising concerns about Coinbase’s capacity to manage surges in user activity. 

	
	
	
	


 



This is not the first time Coinbase has faced such issues; previous outages have occurred during high trading volumes.



In addition to technical difficulties, Coinbase has faced other challenges, including legal scrutiny. 



A U.S. District Court Judge recently ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Coinbase, which alleges the exchange operates as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency, has sufficient merit to proceed.

Ripple's XRP Likely To 'Blow Up Big' To $10 Price Following 7 Years Of Massive Accumulation ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Despite market fluctuations and Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, XRP seems poised for a significant turnaround. Analysts project a major surge in its price after almost a decade of accumulation.



On Sunday, cryptocurrency analyst ‘U-Copy’ tweeted that XRP is approaching the final stages of forming a triangle pattern. This suggests that the seven-year accumulation phase from 2018 to 2024 is nearing its end. According to U-Copy, this accumulation period will likely unveil XRP’s true potential during the 2024 bull cycle.



Notably, drawing parallels to historical trends, after the completion of the 2013-2017 accumulation phase, XRP witnessed an astronomical surge from around $0.005 to $2.5, representing an increase of nearly 500,000%. U-Copy predicted a similar trajectory this time, emphasizing that the current accumulation period has been longer than the previous one. The analyst further revealed he anticipates a substantial upward movement in XRP’s price until the end of the year.



“7 years long Accumulation from 2018-2024 will start to show real color of XRP in 2024 Bull Cycle. Don’t know target price but Shit could blow up big in this Bull Cycle up to December.” He wrote.







Echoing this sentiment, analyst Armando Pantoja outlined a timeline for XRP’s ascent. In Monday’s tweet, the pundit revealed he anticipates key catalysts such as the initiation of a crypto bull run in September or October 2025, potential regulatory easing in the event of a Trump election victory, an XRP ETF announcement, and multiple interest rate cuts in early 2025 to be the key drivers of XRP.

Pantoja further envisioned XRP’s bull run starting from around $0.75 and progressively climbing to $10 by the fourth quarter of 2025 to the first quarter of 2026, signaling growing confidence in XRP’s future trajectory.



Meanwhile, this optimism is further bolstered by recent reports from crypto analytics firm Santiment, which noted a spike in dormant tokens moving on the XRP Ledger. According to the firm, this movement of old coins may be linked to potential interest in buying the dip from key stakeholders, as prices have been climbing mildly since the May 1 spike occurred. Additionally, Santiment highlighted the increasing open interest in exchanges, which recently reached a three-week high.







According to CoinMarketCap data, XRP was trading at $0.50 at the time of this report, reflecting a 1.41% surge over the past 24 hours.

GameStop Pumps as Traders Decipher Cryptic Roaring Kitty Tweets - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsGameStop’s stock (GME) is up 130% in premarket trading, officially placing it among the 500 largest public companies in the U.S. the day after Roaring Kitty returned to Twitter.This comes the day after Keith Gill, most well-known by his Reddit usernames, Roaring Kitting or DeepFuckingValue, returned to social media after three years of silence. He was a core contributor to the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, the story of which was retold in feature film, “Dumb Money,” with Paul Dano starring as the meme stock influencer. RoaringKitty’s first tweet after three years was an image of a man sitting up in his seat, holding a controller, concentrating more on the game he’s playing. This immediately sparked interest in the GameStop stock, doubling its price, and pausing trading times. But, Gill didn’t stop tweeting.Over the next 12 hours, the Twitter account posted 12 videos of iconic movie scenes and monologues edited together by the cryptic tweeter himself. Presented without comment, Twitter users have attempted to decipher what this all means. Meanwhile, GameStop and AMC stocks have already been halted 7 times each today by Nasdaq due to volatility. This follows GME being halted 9 times total yesterday. Market volatility automatically triggers circuit breakers, that temporarily halt trading for a given stock. This happened multiple times during the 2021 meme stock craze.None of the posted videos directly mention GameStop. Despite this, due to Gill’s well-established links to the GME stock, many assume it all relates back to the stock which he famously told Congress that he likes. In turn, GME continued to rise and is now up 130% in premarket trading. Alongside this, a slew of GameStop related meme coins launched on Solana and a GameStop tribute token surged 1,900%. As time has passed, some have started to find deeper, more hidden meanings within the videos. “The best minds of our generation are thinking about what roaring kitty means with those videos,” DeFi Llama dashboard builder, 0xngmi said on Twitter.One of Roaring Kitty’s latest videos says “the dog days are over,” while showing cats on-screen. In response, popular crypto Twitter trader Ansem screamed, “WE NEED YOU TO TELL US WHICH CATCOINS TO BUY.”For this reason, they believe that the meme influencer is saying that cat-themed meme coins are the future.Maybe most notably, however, one video clearly features an Ethereum logo—presumably added by Gill himself. What does this mean? “Idk but I just bought moar,” one Twitter investor said. Some Pepe investors appear to believe one video hints at their token, due to an army’s skin turning green. This led to a price jump of 5.5% in a matter of minutes. While another tweeter thinks that the same clip is a shout out to a meme coin NFT project called NPC. The author of the tweet believes the character’s in the video are gray—a key feature of the NPC avatars. But, as many point out in the replies, the characters in the video are clearly green. While crypto Twitter continues to grasp at straws, Roaring Kitty hasn’t posted for 13 hours.Editor's note: This story was updated to mention that GameStop and AMC stocks have already been halted several times on Tuesday, May 14.

Decline of the Bitcoin Runes protocol: the analysis

The Bitcoin Runes protocol has seen a significant decrease in activity and revenue from fees after the sudden initial increase following the Bitcoin halving.
Although Runes has made progress in the Ordinals protocol, making transactions more convenient and faster, it has not been able to maintain a high level of user adoption. 
Despite an initial phase of enthusiasm, the moment of the protocol has faded and the impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem remains to be evaluated. Let’s see all the details below. 

Disappointed expectations for Bitcoin Runes: the debate on the integration of Solana’s memecoins
As anticipated, activity on the Bitcoin Runes protocol has experienced a slowdown in the last week, indicating a lack of significant user adoption, despite a promising start last month. 
The Runes protocol has brought further improvements to the Ordinals protocol, making transactions even more convenient and fast. 
Ordinal numbers represent a way to embed data in the Bitcoin blockchain, inserting references to digital art in small transactions based on Bitcoin.
The highly publicized Runes were launched after the fourth Bitcoin halving on April 20. Data collected on Dune Analytics indicate that in the first 10 days, the protocol generated over 85,000 token emissions and generated over 3 million dollars in fees.
However, in the last two weeks, all metrics, including fees, new Runes, and user activity, have recorded a decrease of more than 50%. 
Since May 1st, only about 5,000 new Runes have been issued, generating just under $100,000 in fees.
Previously, during its peak, Runes led transactions and fees in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, representing up to 80% of all network activity. 
Currently, this share has dropped to 20%. 
However, it is important to note that this decline occurred during a period characterized by a general decrease in the market, with the drop in Bitcoin (BTC) prices and the slow growth of alternative tokens. 
Factors that may have negatively influenced sentiment towards the new technology.
Expectations and challenges in the world of memecoins on Bitcoin
Runes has captured huge attention on the social platform X before its debut. The creator Casey Rodamor aims to make it a mature protocol for meme coin trading and “degen” traders.
Many industry observers expected the protocol to reflect the thriving ecosystem of meme coins on blockchain like Solana and Base. Likely fueling interest and bets on lesser-known memes.
PUPS, a Runes token, made a big move by emerging and going from less than 10 million dollars in market capitalization to over 150 million dollars in less than a week. It also gained the support of various well-known traders such as BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes.
Various collections and NFT tokens have been launched on Ordinals, and even on Ethereum, before the introduction of the protocol, each aiming to become the largest compilation after launch. 
This activity has made Bitcoin-based NFTs stand out above other collections on the usual leaders Ethereum and Solana, with tens of millions of people changing hands in an otherwise scarce market for non-fungible tokens.
However, some skeptics believe that, although Runes may help build the Bitcoin ecosystem, there is still work to be done. In this regard, Ho Chan Chung, marketing manager at CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk the following: 
“The success of the Bitcoin L2 project based on OP_Return is doubtful, as the UTXO-based blockchain network is fundamentally different from the smart contract-based network. The current notion of Bitcoin as a combined digital currency and the difference in the fundamental blockchain network are the two major obstacles that Bitcoin L2 projects must overcome. Lightning Network has been able to demonstrate this. However, Ordinals, BRC-20, and Runes all seemed to fail in winning the narrative for now.”

Legendary Trader Peter Brandt Says XRP Looks Headed to Zero Against Bitcoin (BTC) - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								Veteran trader Peter Brandt thinks XRP may plummet in value against Bitcoin (BTC) as the pair approaches all-time lows.
Brandt tells his 728,900 followers on the social media platform X that the XRP/BTC pair is in danger of moving below its long-term range low.










According to the seasoned trader, the target for the range breakdown based on classical charting principles is 0.0000002 BTC ($0.013).
“From a pure classical charting point of view (that is, Schabacker, Edwards, Magee), this chart looks like it is headed toward zero…
It is actually fun poking a stick at XRP_aholics. My comparison is to BTC, not USD, so here is what I don’t understand. How can XRP bulls be so insistent in that XRP is near ATLs vs BTC, and, in fact, has only closed higher than present levels in six of the last 126 months?
People so cocky about an asset class (XRP vs BTC) should have a little more performance on their pathetic side before being too critical.”
Source: Peter Brandt/X
Brandt acknowledges the possibility that XRP has more upside potential than BTC for the remainder of the ongoing market cycle but says the “burden of proof” is on the payments altcoin.
“Very possible. But the burden of proof is on XRP, not BTC. And, if the play now is with alts, why not something other than XRP?”
Brandt has been bearish on the XRP/BTC pair since at least 2017.
BTC is trading at $62,834 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 3% in the past 24 hours.
XRP is trading at $0.504 at time of writing. The 7th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 1% in the past 24 hours.

PEPE hits record high as Gamestop meme trading returns


Pepe, a frog-themed memecoin, soared to a record peak value of US$0.00001118 on Tuesday, according to CoinGecko data.



Pepe was the only token in the green across 24 hours among the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, as of 10 a.m. ET.



Pepe’s surge came amid the return of a meme trading frenzy involving stocks of Gamestop (GME), a U.S. video game retailer.



GameStop experienced a dramatic surge of nearly 100% on Tuesday, though it later retreated from these highs. 

	
	
	
	


This upswing built on a 74% increase from Monday. During Monday’s trading, the stock at one point soared up to 110%, leading to multiple trading halts due to its volatility. 



GameStop’s shares surge was sparked by the return of Keith Gill, also known by his online alias “Roaring Kitty.” Gill’s enthusiastic endorsement of GameStop played a pivotal role in triggering the meme stock phenomenon in 2021.



Alongside GameStop, theater chain AMC (AMC) also saw its shares climb significantly on Monday.



On Tuesday, AMC’s stock surged approximately 120% in early trading sessions. According to a filing with the SEC, AMC issued around 72.5 million new shares, successfully raising about $250 million for the company.

JUST IN! FED President Jerome Powell Speaks Live! Here are the Highlights and Bitcoin's Reaction! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The first data was announced in the critical week for Bitcoin and altcoins. Although PPI data came above expectations on a monthly basis, it came in line with expectations on an annual basis.

Although the BTC price experienced a momentary decrease after the data announcement, the price was not affected much.


FED President Jerome Powell, the second biggest event of the week after the PPI data, started his speech at the Dutch Foreign Bankers Association panel.

Stating that the US economy is performing well, Powell said that the US economy remains resilient despite the strong labor market.





Powell signaled that there is no possibility of a possible interest rate increase, saying that the FED will continue to analyze next quarter economic data and fight inflation to reach the 2% target.
Powell, who thinks that restrictive policies may take longer than expected to reduce inflation, expressed his belief that they will reach the inflation target.


Here are the highlights of Powell's speech:

“The US economy is performing very well.
The US economy has a very strong labor market.
There are still labor shortages in many sectors, but overall it's a good picture for now when looking at US economic data.
There are signs of gradual cooling in the labor market as supply and demand reach better balance.
We expect continued GDP growth of 2% or better.
We expect the labor market to continue rebalancing but remain strong.
We did not expect a smooth path on inflation, we must be patient and let politics do its job.
The decline in inflation in the first quarter was notable for its lack of further progress.
We expect inflation to return to levels similar to last year, but my confidence that inflation will fall again is lower than before.
Overall confidence that inflation will fall is also lower than before.
I can't say it's high for PPI data, it's a bit complicated.
Time will tell whether we are restrictive enough on policy.
It may take longer than expected for restrictive policies to reduce inflation, but I believe we will reach the inflation target. It is great that we can even keep the policy rate at the current level.
Do not think that the next move here will be an interest rate increase.
But right now, it looks like we'll be staying at this policy rate for longer than expected. “

Bitcoin, which was at $61,790 before Powell's speech, fell to $61,300 during the speech.
The news will continue to be updated…

Jay Clayton on GameStop Frenzy: Insights from a Former SEC Chairman on Meme Stocks | Cryptoglobe


                                
On May 14, during a segment on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” former U.S. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton shared his views on the meme stock phenomenon, particularly focusing on the astronomical trading volumes of stocks like GameStop and AMC. 



Concerns Over Investment Practices: Clayton expressed significant concern over the behavior of market participants, especially retail investors who are often swayed by social media and other non-traditional forms of investment advice. He pointed out that the massive swings in stock prices based on tweets and speculative buying resemble gambling more than genuine investing. According to him, these activities could potentially undermine the integrity of financial markets.



Legal vs. Ethical Investing: Clayton clarified the distinction between legal and potentially unethical trading practices. He questioned the legality of actions like tweeting to influence stock prices without genuine investment rationale. He highlighted that while not all actions might be illegal, such as openly liking a stock, manipulative actions designed to influence market prices without substantial backing could border on illegality.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Call for Responsible Communication: Emphasizing the responsibility of influencers in the financial markets, Clayton urged individuals like Keith Gil, a prominent figure in the meme stock saga, to be more transparent about their investment decisions. He suggested that influencers should explain their rationale on public platforms, contributing to a more informed and less speculative market environment.



Impact on Market Integrity: Clayton’s main concern lies in the integrity and sustainability of financial markets. He remarked that while market manipulation might not always be clear-cut in legal terms, its potential to harm investor trust and market function is significant. He advocates for a market environment where investment decisions are made based on robust financial analysis rather than speculative hype.

Paradigm Launches Linear Altcoin Options Trading on Deribit Exchange


							

Paradigm introduces linear altcoin options trading with a first block trade in MATIC on Deribit.



The expansion includes MATIC, SOL, and XRP options, offering direct price movement payouts.



The initiative is believed to mark a milestone in liquidity and access for institutional crypto derivatives trading.




Paradigm, the leading liquidity network for derivatives traders, has made a significant stride by expanding its offerings to now include linear altcoin options trading. This expansion was marked by the execution of its inaugural block trade in Polygon (MATIC) on the Deribit Exchange.



Paradigm’s strategic move into linear altcoin options trading was made possible through a strong collaboration with Galaxy, the digital asset leader, and QCP Group, the prominent digital asset market maker. The firm called attention to this development in a statement on its official X account.







The report noted that the introduction of block trading for linear altcoin options on Deribit Exchange now allows clients to execute large-scale trades in MATIC, Solana (SOL), and XRP. Paradigm believes its expansion into this new territory is a testament to its robust track record, which includes over $300 billion in lifetime trading volume.



Linear options, such as those for MATIC, SOL, and XRP, offer a unique advantage. Their payouts are directly tied to the price movements of the underlying assets, providing traders with transparent exposure and substantial trading opportunities. According to the report, this feature is particularly advantageous in volatile markets.



Paradigm’s first move into this new market segment was marked by the successful completion of a block trade involving 500,000 units of MATIC Call Spreads, with strikes at $0.80/$0.95 and expiring on May 31. Paradigm argued that this trade sets a new industry benchmark and contributes to the liquidity of a previously fragmented market.



Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit, expressed excitement over Paradigm’s expansion into linear altcoin options. Strijers highlighted the mutual benefits and the anticipation of upcoming inaugural blocks in SOL and XRP. 









Also, Darius Sit, Founder of QCP, praised the launch as a significant step towards financial innovation in the options space, especially as the market grows to accommodate new participants and liquidity in the approaching bull market.



Jason Urban, Galaxy’s Global Head of Trading, commended Paradigm’s new offering and noted its potential to foster greater liquidity and opportunities.



Anand Gomes, Co-Founder of Paradigm, echoed these sentiments, emphasizing the growth and yield enhancement opportunities that the new crypto options market will bring to all traders.

PEPE Clinches New All-Time High as Trading Volume Explodes - DailyCoin


        
PEPE Derivatives trading volume breaches $5B, topping SHIB & DOGE.



Spot trading volume showcases more activity on PEPE than SOL & XRP.



Analysts assess PEPE’s newly-formed inverse Head ‘n’ Shoulders pattern.
Popular memecoin Pepe (PEPE) has exploded in popularity in both Spot and Derivatives markets, picking up 22% gains over the past 24 hours. This has boosted PEPE to #27 by global market cap, upping the ante for the meme coin department with an over $5 billion trading volume on Derivatives.
Amid the favorable events, PEPE secured a new all-time high of $0.00001096 less than an hour ago, solidifying the yearly PEPE returns to 19,306.6%. PEPE Derivatives trades brought about a larger trading volume than the leading meme coins Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) combined.With a 277.87% hike in PEPE trading volume on Derivatives, the Spot markets are also thriving with a $2,842,205,639 volume. By this metric, PEPE outsources one of the most popular altcoins, Solana (SOL), sporting a $2,256,019,284 trading volume during the same period.PEPE About to Pull Another Huge Move?Alongside the sparking activity on crypto markets, GameStop’s soaring shares on Wall Street added nearly $5 billion to meme coin holders’ wealth. The notable breakout occurred when GameStop (GME) soared by 74.40% over the past 24 hours. It is now trading at $30.45 and also claiming a new yearly high with a market capitalization of $9.32B.Following the surge, many crypto traders crowned PEPE as the SHIB of this bull run, alluding to the 2021 meme coin rally that has given several all-time peaks for the most known meme currencies. While PEPE was not around back then, its comeback has been similar to Shiba Inu’s run to $0.00008616 in October 2021.PEPE has formed an inverse Head ‘n’ Shoulders pattern on the technical charts in the last three months. While the regular Head ‘n’ Shoulders pattern in crypto marks the end of a bullish price trend, the inverse option forecasts a bearish-to-bullish switch.Multiple crypto whale deposits into exchanges portray the soaring network activity. For instance, a ‘smart money’ address tagged by The Data Nerd has poured 250 billion PEPE coins into Binance, initially accumulating 475B PEPE with 0.51 Ether (ETH) a day after the meme coin’s launch.
Multiplying the gains by 2084 times after selling 468B PEPE for $3.13 million, the smart money has not lost belief in PEPE’s future growth. Upon further research by DailyCoin, the whale’s self-custodial crypto wallet still holds  $77,831 worth of PEPE tokens after taking huge profits.On the Flipside
Judging by the selling pressure on spot markets, many traders have decided to sell their PEPE holdings over the past 24 hours.



The $33.93 million in PEPE sales represents an imbalance of $5.5 million between PEPE bids and completed PEPE sales.



Out of the $4.6 million liquidated PEPE positions on Derivatives, $1.82 million were longs despite the 22% price increase.
Why This MattersPEPE evolved into a coin with a powerful crypto community and gained traction among leading crypto exchanges, allowing it to become the third-largest meme token by market capitalization.Discover DailyCoin’s trending crypto stories:Uniswap CEO: Biden’s Crypto Stance Echoes Hillary’s Past ErrorsPolygon (MATIC) Labs Head of DeFi Jumps Ship, Joins Berachain

Analyst Pinpoints $61,500 As Critical Bitcoin Price Level To Monitor


																Amidst the recent decline in Bitcoin’s price and the general cryptocurrency market, popular cryptocurrency analyst and enthusiast Titan of Crypto has highlighted the $61,500 price level as a crucial threshold to watch for the largest cryptocurrency. 
Titan of Crypto analysis examines the aforementioned level as a pivotal point for Bitcoin that could determine the coin’s next price trajectory.
$61,500, A Level To Watch For Bitcoin
Today, May 14, BTC witnessed a sharp decline to nearly $61,500, demonstrating little momentum for a price recovery. While many would see this as a worrying development, Titan of Crypto considers it a noteworthy development. He sees this level as significant and is one to watch out for for Bitcoin.
BTC at $61,500 is the level to watch | Source: Titan of Crypto on X
The crypto expert further warns of an impending volatility in the market around Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell‘s speech later today. Thus, Titan of Crypto has urged the community to remember that it’s better to hold off on making decisions until after the BTC daily candle closes and until the next one confirms the previous one.
The post read:
Bitcoin $61,500 is the level to watch. Expect volatility in the markets around today’s Powell speech. In any case, remember it’s wiser to wait for the BTC daily candle close and confirmation with the following one before jumping to a conclusion.
Although the expert anticipates volatility for Bitcoin, he is confident that the crypto asset’s bull run is far from over, suggesting a movement on the upside is still possible. 

	Related Reading



According to Titan of Crypto, Bitcoin’s Risk-Adjusted Return Oscillator (RAR) indicator has recently moved into the overbought area. However, the analyst asserts that this does not call for alarm, given that Bitcoin took over eight months to peak following the development based on previous bull cycles.
Looking at Bitcoin’s price action from the daily timeframe, the expert confirms that the digital asset is “looking good.” As a result, BTC is following the bullish target to unprecedented heights, specifically around $112,185. “This game is a zero-sum game where impatient people give their money to the patient,” he added.
Possible Retracement To $62,000
While Titan of Crypto anticipates a rally, Ali Martinez, another crypto, has predicted an early price retracement. The expert has highlighted the possibility for BTC to decline to $62,000 in the short term.
According to the analyst, the 4-hour chart’s 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) appears to be rejecting Bitcoin, whereas the TD Sequential indicator suggests a sell signal. Should the development be confirmed, Martinez expects BTC to drop to $62,000. 

	Related Reading



However, for BTC to witness an upward movement, it needs to maintain a 4-hour candlestick close above the $64,000 threshold. Thus, with the coin trading below the $62,000 level, Martinez’s prediction appears to have already manifested. 
At the time of writing, the coin was trading at $61,512, indicating about 1.98% in the past day. Its trading volume was up by 9.67%, while its market cap was down by 2.65% in the last 24 hours.

Crypto Faces 2 Crucial Weeks In US Congress: Here's Why


								The next two weeks could be decisive for the crypto industry as it faces significant legislative developments in the US Congress. These developments may potentially reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States.
3 Major Crypto Legislations Are Up For Vote
The community is closely monitoring the Senate’s upcoming vote on the repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). Initially issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, SAB 121 requires financial institutions to list on their balance sheets the digital assets they hold in custody for clients.
This practice diverges from traditional custodial asset handling, which does not consider custodied assets as part of a company’s own balance sheet. Critics argue that this could unjustly inflate a bank’s assets and liabilities, leading to increased capital reserve requirements and potentially stifling the growth of crypto custody services.
Last week, the House of Representatives saw a bipartisan effort to repeal this regulation, with 21 Democrats joining Republicans. “Last week 21 Democrats took a tough vote and joined Republicans in repealing the SEC’s SAB 121. This is an issue that is important for both banks/crypto and a personal priority for SEC Chair Gensler,” said Ron Hammond, Director of Government Relations at the Blockchain Association via X.

The Senate, led by Senator Cynthia Lummis, is expected to follow suit this week. However, President Biden has indicated plans to veto the repeal, necessitating a challenging two-thirds majority in Congress to override the veto.
“Given the razor thin majorities in both Chambers, we’ve seen a few Congressional Review Acts (CRAs) get to the President’s desk on a bipartisan basis, but have failed at that stage. This requires a 2/3 congressional vote to overturn. Biden plans to veto so tough hill to climb,” Hammond remarked.
Another key legislative item on the agenda is a bill introduced by Representatives Larry Bucshon and Lisa Blunt Rochester. Scheduled for a vote this week, this bipartisan initiative requires the Department of Commerce to serve as the principal adviser to the President on blockchain issues. The bill also proposes the creation of an advisory group within the Commerce Department to further integrate blockchain technology into federal governance and policy-making.
Another highly anticipated legislative push is the upcoming vote on the FIT 21 bill, set around May 23-24. Authored by Patrick McHenry, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, this bill represents the first comprehensive attempt to establish a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies at a federal level.

“FIT 21 is Patrick McHenry’s legacy and the first time Congress will vote on a regulatory framework for crypto. This is a moment that has been in the making for nearly a decade,” Hammond highlighted. The bill has garnered significant attention, and its amendments will be crucial in shaping its final form, appealing to both Democratic and Republican legislators.
Political And Regulatory Context
These legislative efforts occur against a backdrop of heightened regulatory scrutiny by the SEC under Chair Gary Gensler and broader concerns expressed by the Biden administration regarding the alleged risks associated with crypto assets.
The administration argues that SAB 121 is vital for protecting investors and maintaining stability in the financial system. Conversely, many in Congress and the industry believe that the SEC’s current approach hampers innovation and fails to provide clear compliance guidelines.
Moreover, the intersection of crypto policy and election year dynamics cannot be understated. With former President Donald Trump’s recent endorsements of cryptocurrency and its bipartisan potential, crypto policy is emerging as a significant campaign issue.
“Trump inserting himself in crypto has little political risk, but major benefit given the bipartisan campaign wins crypto has been picking up in the primaries,” noted Hammond. This positions crypto as a unique issue that could influence voter demographics, particularly among younger voters who have shown consistent interest in digital asset technologies.
At press time, the total crypto market capitalization stood at $2.208 trillion, still 37% away from its all-time high of November 2021.

Erik Voorhees' New Venture: Why AI Desperately Needs Privacy and Uncensorability - Unchained


                            Erik Voorhees’ latest venture, Venice, is a private, uncensorable, open-source AI agent run on decentralized computation.
                        
                    
                    
                        Posted May 14, 2024 at 12:00 pm EST.                     

                    Listen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Overcast, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Castbox, Google Podcasts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.
Erik Voorhees, a crypto OG, has launched Venice, a private, uncensorable, open-source competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude, powered by a decentralized crypto network.
In the episode, Erik and Venice’s COO Teana Baker-Taylor delve into the problems with censorship and data in current AI agents, including how they create honeypots of information about users’ search history for hackers, or that they can be absurdly politically correct, such as refusing to create images of Caucasian people. As they point out, there’s also the risk that the companies managing them could be censoring the models to please the Chinese government, in order to access the market in that country. They talk about their plan for Venice to gain market share, considering that DuckDuckGo, a privacy-preserving competitor to Google, has a much smaller market share. And they explain why they intend for Venice to eventually use the compute of Morpheus, or other decentralized crypto-powered compute networks.
They also critique the SEC’s current regulatory approach to crypto, calling it “a joke.” Additionally, they explore the concept of AI agents using cryptocurrencies as their primary currency.
Show highlights:

Why Erik decided to move into artificial intelligence and merge it with crypto
What problems decentralized AI would solve and why it’s hard to solve sexist and racist views in LLMs
The differences between ChatGPT and other similar products and Venice AI
Why privacy is so important for users, according to Erik, and how Venice doesn’t store the users’ information
How central governments could manipulate information to their own benefit and how to avoid it
Whether people will shift from using search engines to LLMs
What Morpheus is and its goal to provide decentralized computation for AI
How Erik and Teana believe crypto and AI will continue to work together
Erik’s and Teana’s thoughts on some of the recent government actions against founders of crypto privacy services such as Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash
Why Erik believes that the SEC has become a joke

Bitcoin Hashrate Dips Post-Halving, Here's Why | Coinspeaker



Bitcoin mining firms have reportedly been turning off unprofitable mining rigs since the fourth Bitcoin halving.

Bitcoin hashrate witnessed an over two-month low of 575 exahash per second (EH/s) on May 10. That is according to data from blockchain.com.
Although it has now made a slight recovery to around 586 EH/s, the dropping hashrate remains evident, begging the question of why.




Considering the halving that took place last month, expectations were that the hashrate will surge. However, that is proving not to be the case, at least, for the time being.
The Bitcoin network’s hash rate has dwindled since the halving event, and from the look of things, mining firms may have played a huge role in this reality. For context, Bitcoin mining firms have been turning off unprofitable mining rigs since the fourth Bitcoin halving. This sentiment was echoed by the head of research at CoinShares, James Butterfill, who also shared a similar perspective about the hashrate drop in an X post. Per Butterfill, the drop is a direct consequence of miners’ decision to start turning off unprofitable rigs.
It might be worth noting that the exact direction of Bitcoin’s hashrate is exactly as CoinShares predicted in an earlier report. While there is currently a slight setback, expectations are that the hashrate will hit 700 by 2025. CoinShares’ prediction statement goes as follows:
“Our model forecasts the hash rate rising to 700 exahash by 2025, although after the halving, it could fall by up to 10% as miners turn off unprofitable ASICs.”
According to the April 19 report, hashrate will temporarily be negatively impacted by the increased cost of Bitcoin mining and increasing electricity costs, among other things.
Bitcoin Hashrate and Profitability
Without a doubt, infrastructure and energy costs remain the major determinants of profitability for BTC miners. However, there is also a correlation between Bitcoin’s price and profitability.
If Bitcoin’s price drops, some miners may find it unprofitable to continue operations, leading to a decrease in the hashrate as less computational power is devoted to mining.
The correlation was recently explained by Nazar Khan, the co-founder and COO of TeraWulf. According to him, only smaller mining operations with less energy-efficient equipment will be in danger. Khan explained that firms that own just a small bunch of mining machines will struggle to stay profitable.
“If you are a company that owns quality infrastructure that can deliver low-cost power, that’s a real asset and if anything the underlying value of that asset [BTC] has increased…” the statement reads.

                        In a recent exclusive interview with Cryptonews, Spencer Farrar, a Partner at Theory Ventures, talked about the recent difficulty of raising capital and how the Theory team managed to do it.Chatting with Cryptonews Podcast’s host Matt Zahab, Farrar discussed the necessity of projects having an edge that makes them unique and attractive to investors.Lastly, he stressed the importance of thorough research and understanding the market, as well as the type of companies Theory is investing in.VIDEOAlignment Between Investor and Project is Key
Farrar noted that the total dollar amount deployed into the venture space was the lowest it’s been in several years.Therefore, 2023 was a hard year for emerging managers to raise capital.Despite that, Theory Ventures managed to raise millions. The team was fortunate, persistent, and “greedy when others are fearful,” as Warren Buffett once said.For an investor, it’s very important to have an “edge” and fully understand what that edge is.On the other hand, for a founder, a big part of one’s strategy when taking money should be making sure that there’s alignment with investors.“And I think when taking money,” Farrar said, “it’s important to actually do some thought around cap table design and understand: I’m going to get support from my main lead investor here, and these angels can introduce me to these ecosystems or help with business development.”Notably, he added that the most influential people are actually on Twitter.‘Technical Discontinuity’ Makes You Unique
When it comes to Theory Ventures, Farrar stressed two key elements: deep research and ‘technical discontinuity.’The latter essentially means an edge. In other words, a project Theory would invest in needs to have something in the market that it understands better than others.Notably, Theory’s own edge is very thorough research.Before even starting, the founding team – including venture capitalist Tomasz Tunguz – reviewed all the historical data on venture firms, their performance, and winning strategies.They established Theory as a thesis-driven firm. Their deep research provides them with an understanding of the market they’re investing in and enables them to have “a lot of conviction” in the companies they’re backing.Ultimately, those who have a great understanding of the market can identify a winner, Farrar remarked.Therefore, Theory itself is taking a highly concentrated approach toward investing in next-generation software companies.They aim to back highly technical founders with “some sort of technical discontinuity.”Doing Due Diligence Leads to Success
Theory invests in Web2 and Web3, primarily looking into data, AI, and crypto companies.They do extensive research in these markets and talk to many customers. For example, on the B2B side, they talk to big enterprises to understand their problems and needs.There are two stages before Theory decides on making an investment, Farrar said.First, Farrar will talk to developers building on top of an ecosystem, the ecosystem partners, and “as many people as I can.”Then, the team will also contact individuals in crypto and Web2 to try to understand the market dynamics. They’ll seek to understand the market, customer appetite, developer interest, any potential holes in the market, etc.Currently, there are two crypto investments the team is “extremely excited about.” Though Farrar couldn’t provide details, he said he could “tease it out.”First, Theory works with a fast-growing data company, which in turn works with some major finance companies.“You’re seeing the entrance of a lot of big financial institutions that need to touch crypto and so they need data,” Farrar said.The other company Theory is working with has “some novel economics that we’re really excited about.”Meanwhile, in the Web2 world, Farrar worked with a vector compute company called Superlinked. They turn all the company data, metadata, and additional features into a vector for a highly performant search.This is very prominent within AI today, and it’s a pure infrastructure investment. It’s highly valuable for the future of search and retrieval, Farrar concluded.____That’s not all.In this interview, Farrar also discussed:
time at Berkeley as a cognitive science major and an athlete;
taking business courses;
“stumbling” into the tech world and investing in crypto;
working at Web3 startup Velocity
the state of Web3 funding;
what Web3 startups need to do to have a comeback;
venture strategy and liquid strategy in crypto;
AI-based Web3/blockchain companies;
the relevance of branding in crypto.

3 Interesting Picks Amid a New Meme Stock Craze - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Reminiscing about the late 2020 period, the market is seeing a resurgence of meme stock trading. And once again, GameStop (NYSE: GME) is the leader, with an astronomical 377% resurgence over one month. In January 2021, GME shares went up from $4.3 to $86.88 per share.



This time around, since May 1st, GME stock has gone up from $10.91 to briefly $64.69 per share, rapidly falling under the $50 range and then up again at press time. This is ahead of the gaming retailer’s Q1 2024 earnings scheduled for June 5th. 



Across analyst forecasts and platforms, GameStop is largely rated as “sell,” given that the company’s brick-and-mortar fundamentals remain dubious. This has also been the case for the wider meme stock phenomenon, demonstrated by the shutdown of Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (MEME) by the end of 2023.



While Nasdaq’s GME price target is $5.6, what about other meme stocks that have ridden the GameStop wave?



Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN)



At a time when Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is cutting jobs amid cratering demand for luxury EVs, it is not optimal to be a lesser EV company but for premium electric SUVs. In line with expectations, Rivian delivered 13,588 EVs in Q1 2024, reaffirming April’s production figures to match the 57,000 total vehicles guidance for the full year.



On May 7th, the company delivered Q1 2024 earnings, boasting a 5.1% EV market share in the US. At a price tag of over $70k, the R1S model proved to be the best-seller for the quarter. Nonetheless, Rivian remains unprofitable, having reported a net loss of $1.446 billion vs $1.349 billion in the year-ago quarter.



Rivian’s free cash flow also remains depleted. Although improving, it is still negative, from negative $1.8 billion last year to negative $1.5 billion this quarter. Compared to Tesla, Rivian’s debt-to-equity ratio is now 0.549 vs 0.076 respectively. 



However, as Rivian keeps to its production schedule ahead of the launch of more affordable R2 and R3 vehicles for mainstream consumers, there is more upside for RIVN stock. Pulled by Nasdaq, the analyst consensus placed the average RIVN price target at $14.57 vs current $11.75 per share. 



Rivian’s 52-week low price is $8.26 per share. Over the last month, RIVN stock has increased 26%, outperforming TSLA by 2.5%. 





Reddit, Inc. (NASDAQ: RDDT)



Also on May 7th, Reddit delivered its Q1 2024 earnings. The progenitor of the meme stock trading, the social media platform reached a milestone. Up until this quarter, the company failed to deliver a profitable one.



But on an adjusted EBITDA basis, this was Reddit’s first profitable quarter, notwithstanding the net loss from the IPO launch expenses. Year-over-year, Reddit saw a 48% uptick in revenue to a net loss of $575.1 million, with the adjusted EBITDA of positive $10 million compared to negative $50.2 million in a year-ago quarter.



From the present revenue level of $243 million, the company’s guidance is set to the $240 – $255 million range, and adjusted EBITDA between $0 and $15 million from the $10 million milestone. RDDT shares are now among the most performant of the meme stocks, having gained 50% value over a one-month period.



However, the initial hype is likely to subside towards correction. WSJ’s average RDDT price target is $59.60 vs the currently elevated $64 per share. Reddit’s 52-week low price is $37.35, below the WSJ’s low forecast of $45 per share.



Nio, Inc. (NASDAQ: NIO ADR)



At $5.71 per share, NIO is a borderline penny stock, gaining a 43% boost over the month. The Chinese EV company has proven it can scale its operations for the smart electric vehicle market and battery as a service (BaaS). Like Rivian, Nio is primarily focused on premium SUVs and sedans.



The company increased deliveries by 30.7% from 2022 to 2023, having delivered a total of 160,038 EVs in 2023.



While Nio did suffer a $756 million net loss in Q4 2023, this was a 7.2% improvement from the year-ago quarter. Likewise, the company increased its cost-efficiency, showcased by the 11.9% vehicle margin compared to 6.8% in the year-ago quarter. In late December, CYVN’s strategic $2.2 billion equity investment will ensure Nio’s next exciting rollout. 



In the second half of 2024, Nio is poised to enter the mainstream market with a more affordable model dubbed “Alps,” set within the $27k to $41.5k price range. Subsequently named Onvo, it is scheduled to launch on May 15th as the L60 model.



This could pose a major blow to Tesla’s shrinking presence in the Chinese market, even after multiple aggressive price cuts. Nasdaq consensus on the average NIO price target is $6.59 vs. the current $5.71 per share. Nio’s 52-week low price is $3.61, for context.

Black Donald Trump Rallies 600% Before Consolidating, As Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP), a Solana memecoin that was launched yesterday, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Black Donald Trump presents a similar opportunity.



BLATRUMP rallied over 600% in the first few hours after its launch, before consolidating as some early buyers cashed out their profits.



However, most investors are still holding their tokens, as they are waiting for BLATRUMP to be listed on ByBit later this week, as this listing will cause the coin’s price to skyrocket.




Its current price presents a great opportunity for new investors to buy the dip before the next rally. 



BLATRUMP has a market cap below $30,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of around $500,000-$1,000,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-3,000% in a matter of days or hours. 



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally another 12,000% in the coming two days, and Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, BLATRUMP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for BLATRUMP by entering its contract address – 29BiHVTBEo7RnbtwqwTmV3Hy6nDTadcCgopM6HUyjGRK –  in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BLATRUMP.

Crypto community outraged as court jails Tornado Cash developer for over five years

A Dutch court has sentenced Alexey Pertsev, a developer involved with Tornado Cash, to 64 months in prison.He was convicted of laundering $1.2 billion in crypto through the Tornado Cash mixer between July 9, 2019, and August 10, 2022.Pertsev’s legal team has a 14-day window to appeal the court’s decision.This verdict follows Pertsev’s arrest by Dutch authorities nearly two years ago, in August 2022. At that time, the US government had sanctioned the crypto mixing tool for aiding entities like North Korea-backed Lazarus Group in laundering their illegal proceeds.The ruling in Pertsev’s case could have significant implications for the crypto sector, particularly as other Tornado Cash developers face trials in the United States. In August 2023, the Department of Justice (DOJ) brought charges against Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm, alleging money laundering and violations of US sanctions laws.Crypto community reactsPertsev’s conviction has riled up members of the crypto community, who are criticizing the judgment.Pablito, the head of security research at Blockfence, said the ruling was a “sad day for privacy, crypto and open-source.” He added that “the war is not over. Privacy is a human right.”Meanwhile, Alexandre Stachtchenko, a web3 expert, said:“This has gone too far. It is time to end this KYC and surveillance mess before it eats democracy itself. I will soon publish a text calling for action and support.”Similarly, Michelle Weekley, the director of product development at Byte Federal, opined that the ruling showed crypto users either “participate in AML/KYC regulation or go to jail.” She added:“This is the real fight and we either take down the global banking regulation cartel or we just apply all their laws to the new ecosystem and continue to live under their tyrannical dictatorship.”Mentioned in this articleLatest Netherlands StoriesLatest Alpha Market Report

DeFi Lender Liquity (LQTY) Unveils Protocol Upgrade, New Stablecoin BOLD in White Paper

"LUSD is great for its decentralized capabilities, but it doesn't have the built-in flexibility to adapt to changing market environments like rising or falling interest rates," Samrat Lekhak, head of business development and communications at Liquity, said in an interview over Telegram. "In times of positive interest rates, this implies a need for a continuous yield source for the stablecoin, which BOLD provides."

Unofficial GameStop memecoin surpasses $100M in market cap

GME, an unofficial Solana memecoin parody of American gaming retailer GameStop, has surpassed $100 million in market capitalizarion amid a trading frenzy of its namesake (but unrelated) entity. As of May 14, the GME memecoin has returned 2,291% within the past week and trades at $0.01449 at the time of publication. The move was largely fueled by investor interest in shares of GameStop Corp, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, which havd surged 228% in the past five trading days. Breakout of the unofficial GameStop memecoin on Solana: Source: CoinMarketCapIn addition, the GME memecoin’s listing on centralized exchanges, such as Bitget and BingX, appears to have propelled buying activity. It appears that Keith Gill’s sudden and unexpected return—the trader widely credited with kicking off the 2021 Reddit-infused GameStop short squeeze—has led to yet another short squeeze of GME shares among enthusiastic investors. In the 24 hours following Gill’s return to X, shares of GameStop rallied as much as 111% in price. It's not just average day-to-day traders who are benefitting from the market euphoria. Ryan Cohen, GameStop’s CEO, chairman, and largest individual shareholder with a 12% stake, reportedly holds $1 billion of unrealized capital gains that arose from the ongoing short squeeze. The memecoin hysteria has gripped much of the crypto industry this year. On May 13, the unofficial Pepe the Frog memecoin PEPE, minted on Ethereum, rallied over 34% in a single day to set a new record high of $0.00001119 on Binance. On March 22, the price of Solana memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF) hit a record high following its $700,000 Vegas Sphere fundraiser. Immediately following the campaign’s conclusion, WIF’s price spiked 25%, briefly pushing the token to $3 and a total market capitalization of $3 billion. On April 3, a trader reportedly turned $13,000 into $2 million within several hours by purchasing Bitget Wallet’s Donotfomoew (MOEW) memecoin, deployed on the Base blockchain, shortly after its launch and selling their positions after MOEW picked up traction. The apparent recklessness of investors gambling on memecoins has attracted warnings from experts. In a statement on April 24, prominent DeFi sleuth ZachXBT wrote that 12 Solana memecoins allegedly raised a combined $26.7 million from investors and then abruptly abandoned the projects. According to ZachXBT, the most costly “abandoned” presale project was a memecoin dubbed “I like this coin,” which sported the ticker LIKE.Related: Memecoins rally as Bitcoin recovers to all-time high

Wisconsin state holds $99 million in BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF shares - Crypto Briefing




The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) revealed its holdings of over $99 million worth of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) IBIT at the end of the first quarter, according to its 13F Form filings with the SEC. The amount is equivalent to 2,450,500 IBIT shares.Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated through an X post that “big fish institutions”, such as state pensions, usually don’t get in the 13F forms for up to a year, when the ETF gets more liquidity. “Good sign, expect more, as institutions tend to move in herds,” he added.SWIB is an independent state agency which is responsible for managing the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS), State Investment Fund (SIF), and several other smaller trust funds. Their 13F Form discloses nearly $37.9 billion in holdings.Notably, SWIB joins institutions such as UBS, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo on Bitcoin exposure through ETFs. However, as highlighted by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the 13F Forms are a “snapshot” of these institutions’ holdings as of March 31, and they don’t account for short positions and derivatives.Moreover, some of these holdings might not be related to a long position, as companies such as JPMorgan could be acting as market makers for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US.ETFs suffer outflowsAs of May 13, the spot Bitcoin ETFs traded in the US suffered a daily outflow of 866 BTC, which is equivalent to $55 million, as reported by the X user identified as Lookonchain.Despite the 292 BTC in inflows registered by IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC, the ETFs managed by Grayscale, Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton witnessed a 1,158 outflow on the same day. The total amount of Bitcoin under management is 826,220 BTC.

AI could screw gaming economy, The Voice Coach Battle, Axies: Web3 Gamer


            
AI could flood the market: ArenaX Labs co-founder



ArenaX Labs co-founder Wei Xie — the company behind AI battle training game AI Arena — believes artificial intelligence could help smaller game companies compete against the industry giants. But he warns it may also disrupt the entire gaming economy.



“AI creates a slightly more level playing field for smaller companies or groups, giving them the ability to compete against the very large enterprises with extensive resources. This could lead to a renaissance period for indie gaming,” Xie tells Web3 Gamer.



“In the future, we may see smaller teams able to develop impressive games at a lower cost and faster velocity. This trend is clear and shows no signs of slowing down,” he adds.



He argues that AI “amplifies the capacity” that gaming companies have to develop games, allowing for the “frictionless creation” of new characters and environments.



However, friction usually acts like a scale in the gaming economy and balances out the competition in the industry. When resources are scarce — such as top expensive developers — and there is fair competition to create the best games, it allows for market equilibrium.



“The removal of friction, which typically acts as an arbiter mediating competitive forces and ensuring balance within the economy, may create significant headwinds when it comes to economic design,” he says.



If AI makes everything too easy, there’s a risk of flooding the market with too many games and creating an oversupply of developers who will no longer be needed.



“In Web3 gaming, where games are financialized, this poses a challenge as it can massively distort the supply and demand curve,” he adds.






Another issue is in companies using off-the-shelf AI solutions to build games without understanding what’s going on under the hood. 



“This may lead to interesting technical challenges that they cannot overcome, or hidden issues with using AI in the context of gaming that only become apparent once the game is live or distributed to an audience, making it difficult to fix,” he explains.



AI Battle training game AI Arena allows you to train up your character through imitation learning (AI Arena)



ArenaX’s player-versus-player fighting game AI Arena, claims to be the first game to integrate human and AI collaboration.



Xie paints it as a cross between classic fighting games Super Smash Bros and Pokemon, except you can train super smart AI characters to play exactly how you want them to.




“In the context of AI Arena, human players are training AI models to play games like how they play, through a process called imitation learning. The AI learns via demonstration and observation of the human player’s actions.”




Even if it’s not really your thing, it’s worth a look just to see how it’s going to make our jobs disappear in the next decade.



The game kicked off on May 1 and held an airdrop competition where more than 700,000 battles were fought in just nine days.

Crush dreams from home, The Sandbox teams up with The Voice



Ever wanted to be in one of those swivel chairs on The Voice and either make or absolutely crush a singer’s dreams on The Voice?



If you’ve missed the singing competition juggernaut, The Voice is where typically contestants appear with clips of themselves at their regular office job, then go on stage and blow the room away, get a standing ovation, one or all four celebrity judges hit the buzzer, and then spin their chairs around to get their first look at the person behind The Voice.



And then, a year later, most of the contestants are back at that same office job.



Practice your critical and mentoring skills (or just being a powerful celeb) on The Voice Coach Battle (ITV Studios).



Sounds fun? Well, you can now get a taste of being a judge and play along with new episodes of the TV series without leaving the comfort of your own home in The Sandbox metaverse.



Teaming up with the Virtual Brand Group and ITV Studios, The Sandbox has introduced “The Voice Coach Battle,” which says it’s a “Web3 gaming adventure.”



“Just like on the TV show, players must select music, choose a fantastic wardrobe, perfect stage lighting, and offer advice to their artist at each stage. In addition, players must complete quizzes on the TV show’s real celebrity coaches,” according to a recent statement.






So not only do you get to play a game but you also get to practice some pretty important life skills like mentoring, difficult conversations (if you get a dud singer), and artist management. 



Nonfungible tokens (NFTs) are also on offer to coincide with each new episode of The Voice series. 



If you accurately predict which contestants advance through the elimination rounds each week on the actual show on NBC, you will receive an exclusive NFT.



But it does mean you will have to sit through watching The Voice…

Hot Take: Duet Monsters



At first, Duet Monsters might seem like a game for kids, with its catchy musical tunes and overall look. But it kept me hooked much longer than I expected for a game where fruit falls from the sky.



Released on May 9, the alpha version of the mobile dual-rhythm music game is a collaboration between Sky Mavis — the creators of the hit game Axie Infinity — and Cadenverse. 



Don’t let any fruit fall below the tree branch! (Duet Monsters)



In a nutshell, you’re in charge of handling two Axies, making sure they catch all the falling fruit with their mouths. 



Even though I’ve now covered 99% of the game, I will keep going.



The screen is split into two halves. At first, you just need to focus on one Axie at a time, getting it to catch the fruit in its mouth on one side of the screen. But as you progress, you’ll have to multitask and juggle both Axies at once.



Easy, right? But then it gets slightly quicker and quicker, with fruit eventually falling at the same time for both Axies. 



Every fruit caught in the mouth plays a musical note. So, among the rising intensity and stress of the game, you’re also composing a whimsical tune in the background.



If you have a Ronin Wallet and 2 Axie NFTs, you can earn up to 3,000 AXP and 20 SLP daily. If not, you can play as a guest without connecting your wallet, but you won’t be able to earn any crypto rewards. 



It’s a much simpler game than Axie Infinity by Sky Mavis, but with its musical elements and the task of moving the Axies to catch the fruit and create music, it also has a bit of a Guitar Hero vibe.



Every time I lost, it gave me that “one more” feeling you get from arcade games like Stacker — a game where you have to stack the blocks to the top row to win a prize. 



How hard can it be to feed two furry creatures falling fruit?



There’s also a leaderboard for the top 1,000 players worldwide, so it’s a good opportunity to jump on this game earlier and see if you can get a spot on the leaderboards.

Bitcoin And Gold Won't Save You - Benzinga

With the rise of AI, the growing U.S. debt, and the looming possibility of WWIII, there’s been some discussion about how to invest in case society collapses. Though these conversations tend to be overly dramatic, most of the theories around how to allocate your money for the end of the world are misguided. As I tweeted a few weeks ago:
One of the worst arguments I’ve seen is that you should own gold or Bitcoin BTC/USD in case of societal collapse. I can promise you that both will be worthless in this scenario. Internet money and a shiny rock only have value in a functioning civilization, not the apocalypse.
If the world (as we know it) comes to an end, many of the things that we rely on today, such as the internet, may be unavailable. In such a scenario, what we value would change dramatically. Things that were traditional stores of value in a civilized society (i.e. Bitcoin, gold, stocks, etc.) would have almost no use in an uncivilized one. And things that we once took for granted would have immense value overnight.But what are the those things? And should you invest in them to hedge against a societal collapse? Let’s take a look.What Is Always Valuable To Humans?If the apocalypse ever comes, the things that will remain valuable to humans are those that satisfy our most basic needs. On Maslow’s hierarchy of needs these would be related to our physiology and our safety. These include:
	Food/Water: Highest on the list of needs are those that keep us immediately alive. This is where canned goods, emergency water, and farmland would be extremely valuable in an end-of-the-world like scenario. While having a farm would be an expensive way to hedge the apocalypse, there’s no excuse when it comes to having emergency food and water.

	
		The ideal emergency foodstuffs are those with the longest shelf life. These include: honey, canned goods, dried beans, white rice, and sugar, among other things. Make sure to store your food in air tight containers in a cool, dry place for the best results. In addition, if you have access to electricity, you can store even more food in a freezer or refrigerator.
		When it comes to water, in addition to having emergency water, you may also want to consider getting a LifeStraw. This is a piece of survival equipment that will allow you to drink un-purified natural sources of water without having to boil it first. While not a perfect long-term solution, it could come in handy when you are on the go. 
	
	
	Shelter: Once you have enough food to survive, you will also need to ensure that you have a place to stay. This could be your primary home or a safe house, if there is an armed conflict in the area. This might seem extreme, but during WWII some French citizens were able to escape to their safe houses in the countryside as the cities were taken over. While there is no perfect shelter, having a place to protect you from the elements and other threats is paramount to your survival.
	Medicine: In a world where healthcare systems are nonexistent, access to medicine can mean the difference between life and death. Without functioning hospitals and pharmacies, even minor injuries and illnesses can become life-threatening. As a result, you should stock up on a variety of different medicines to stay alive.
	
		Some of these medicines include: prescriptions (if necessary), over-the-counter medications (e.g. ibuprofen, painkillers, etc.), first aid and hygiene supplies, and dental equipment (e.g. toothbrush, toothpaste, etc.). Ensuring that you can assist with common forms of pain while also preventing infection will be crucial in a survival scenario.
		In addition to having medicine, it’s equally important to be able to assist yourself and others when necessary. Consider taking first-aid/CPR classes and having reference textbooks on how to administer medical care in an emergency. 
	
	
	Survival Gear/Weapons: In addition to the essentials like food, water, and medicine, having the right gear and weaponry can greatly enhance your chances of survival in a post-apocalyptic world.
	
		Some of the most necessary survival gear would include: fire-starting equipment, portable lighting, communication devices, and other tools. Having the ability to be portable, make food, and setup shelter (if necessary) will provide you with more flexibility in case you can’t stay in one location indefinitely.
		If you’re in a world where law and order no longer apply, having weapons for your own defense will be paramount. You should consider buying pepper spray, a taser, knife, and even firearms (if legal in your area) to defend yourself. While this won’t guarantee your survival, it’s better to have these weapons and not need them, then need them and not have them. 
	
	
	Community: Following a societal collapse, you may need more than just a list of items to survive. This is where a community of people you can trust will make all the difference. Not only will a strong community allow you to share resources, knowledge, and protection, but it can also provide emotional support in the post-apocalyptic era. They say that there’s strength in numbers and nowhere is this more true than when civilization ceases to function normally.
While the probability of a global societal collapse is incredibly low, preparing for such an event can have its advantages even if the apocalypse never comes.For example, early on in my time in NYC I bought a chemical spill kit in case a biological weapon was ever used on the city. I remember telling my colleague Michael Batnick about this and he thought it was ridiculous. He even tweeted about it.Well, a little over a year later COVID-19 swept through NYC and people were getting infected left and right. While the CDC wasn’t yet recommending mask usage, I wanted to find one, but couldn’t. Then I remembered—my chemical spill kit!After digging through my closet I found the kit and opened it. Lo and behold, inside was an N95 mask. My low-grade paranoia had saved me. Did that N95 mask make a difference? I have no idea. But I never caught COVID in that first year and I was masked up far sooner than many others.This is just one example of how preparing for the worst can provide you with future benefits that you can’t even imagine. So even if we don’t experience the end of the world, having emergency supplies and a strong community could benefit you in other ways. You don’t have to spend a lot of money on this either. I spent $200 and that was enough to provide me with peace of mind in case things got very bad.Of course, things are unlikely to get very bad everywhere at once. However, they can get bad in one place very easily. It’s in this scenario where things like Bitcoin and gold still have value.Where Bitcoin & Gold Still Have ValueSo far we’ve assumed that Bitcoin and gold would be worthless in a global civilization-ending event. I hope you can see why this would be the case. However, what about during a smaller, localized collapse? Say an individual country experiences a coup or their currency is devalued due to hyperinflation. Would Bitcoin and gold be valuable there? Absolutely. In the event of a localized collapse, anything that is still considered a store of value by the rest of civilization will remain valuable. As long as you can transport this wealth to another (more stable) location, it will have value. So as much as I want to dunk on people that buy assets to hedge the apocalypse, they have a point if the “apocalypse” is much smaller in scope. Fortunately, most of the people that own such assets will never experience any such event. They live in relatively stable countries yet invest in Bitcoin and gold as if the global financial system is on the verge of collapse. While there are many reasons to own these assets, total collapse of the financial system is one of the least convincing. If such an event ever occurs, we will have much bigger problems on our hands than our portfolios.Thank you for reading.If you liked this post, consider signing up for my newsletter.

Poloniex Hack: $53.5 Million in ETH Laundered via Tornado Cash - Coin Edition


							

Poloniex lost over $100 million in Ether due to a compromised private key.



The hacker transferred approximately 17,800 ETH ($53.5 million) to Tornado Cash.



Poloniex has been unable to recover the stolen funds.




About 17.8K ($53.5 million) ETH associated with the November 2023 Poloniex hack has been traced to Tornado Cash, a decentralized cryptocurrency tumbler. PeckShieldAlert disclosed this development via an X post: “The Poloniex hacker has already sent a total of 17.8K $ETH (worth $53.5 million) to TornadoCash.”



Recall that wallets owned by the cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex experienced a malicious attack on November 10, 2023. This action resulted in the exchange losing over $100 million worth of Ether.



Soon after, Poloniex asserted that it had found the hacker and offered a $10 million reward for the stolen funds. However, the efforts proved fruitless, as the funds were not returned to the exchange. CertiK, a blockchain security firm, suggested that the hack stemmed from a “private key compromise.”



Meanwhile, Poloniex reacted to the incident by temporarily turning off affected wallets. Poloniex’s efforts to retrieve the stolen funds have proved futile, as the hacker has no intention of remitting them. 









After several investigations, PeckShield discovered that approximately $53.5 million had been transferred through Tornado Cash. For context, the hacker transferred about 17,800 ETH from six different wallets into a single Tornado Cash address.



Shortly after the wallet compromise, Poloniex resumed operations, enabling investors to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies freely. Moreover, the exchange took proactive steps by appointing a top-tier security auditing firm to strengthen fund security and prevent future hacks.



Poloniex stated that the security audit is nearing completion, with verification processes underway. After concluding the audit, the platform will promptly resume deposit and withdrawal services. 



“Currently, they are in the final stages of the security audit and verification processes for Poloniex. Upon completion of the audit, we will promptly resume deposit and withdrawal services on our platform,” the exchange asserted.



Meanwhile, TRON founder and Poloniex’s owner Justin Sun assured users affected by the breach of full remuneration. Sun further emphasized Poloniex’s robust financial position and expressed intentions to partner with other exchanges to reclaim the lost funds.

MAGA Shiba Inu (MAGASHIB) to Skyrocket 13,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

MAGA Shiba Inu (MAGASHIB) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



MAGA Shiba Inu (MAGASHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because MAGASHIB has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC – one of the largest exchanges in the world.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, MAGA Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and MAGA Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin.



MAGA Shiba Inu launched with over $7,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy MAGA Shiba Inu on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for MAGA Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 73mqxPkM9P59GeudJ2DT8i2v94QfLkfVVbfQnU2DTP5r – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MAGASHIB.

This Crypto Expert Called The Bitcoin Top in 2021, Now He’s Calling The Bottom In 2024


																As the Bitcoin price continues to fluctuate wildly, the question in every investor’s mouth right now is when the digital asset will find its bottom. For some, the bottom has already been met, while for others, there are still more price crashes to come. However, one analyst’s prediction in particular stands out and this is due to his track record of accurately calling the top of the market back in the 2021 bull market.
Crypto Expert Says Bitcoin Bottom Is In
Crypto expert Dave the Wave first came into prominence back in 2021 when he had accurately predicted the Bitcoin top. Given this, Dave’s analysis holds weight in the crypto market, so it is no surprise that his most recent prediction calling the Bitcoin bottom is making the rounds.
Related Reading: Gaming The System: Pundit Reveals Why XRP Price Will Reach $33
In the analysis which was posted on X (formerly Twitter), the crypto analyst points to a number of indicators that show that the Bitcoin bottom has already been reached. One of these is the MACD which the analyst reveals is still far off from the levels from the last bull market.
In addition to the MACD still trending below this level, the crypto expert points out that the crypto market is more mature than it was. Given this maturing market, Dave the Wave stated: “It wouldn’t at all surprise me to see something different develop, pattern-wise, over the longer time frame.”
The analyst suggests that the Bitcoin low is actually in, and given that the price had fallen to $57,000 a couple of weeks ago, Dave’s analysis suggests that that is as low as the price will go. If this holds, then it is possible that the Bitcoin price will not fall below $60,000 before it resumes its bull rally.
BTC Price Expectations Still Bullish
Despite the slow momentum that has plagued the Bitcoin price, investors continue to be bullish on the cryptocurrency. This is evidenced by the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index maintaining a firm grip on the Greed territory, showing that investors are still willing to buy into the market.

Furthermore, predictions from crypto analysts such as Rekt Capital have shown expectations for further price increases. Rekt Capital predicts that the BTC price will still cross $100,000 as long as the price is able to break above $63,000 and hold this level.
However, elsewhere in social media, there is a change in tide for the BTC price as social sentiment begins to fall to bearish headwinds. Santiment, an on-chain data aggregation platform, revealed that the Bitcoin social sentiment has seen a 14% drop in the last week.

Market Expert Says Bitcoin Price Has Officially Left The Danger Zone, Can Price Strike $100,000? | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently suggested that the worst might be over for Bitcoin. If so, the flagship crypto may be primed for a move to the upside, rising to as high as $100,000, which some other crypto analysts have predicted would be the case. 
Bitcoin Is Out Of The “Danger Zone”
Rekt Capital mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Bitcoin Post-Halving “Danger Zone” is officially over. He added that Bitcoin is “celebrating with a good bounce from the Re-Accumulation Range Low support.” The crypto analyst had previously explained that the danger zone was the downside wick that Bitcoin experienced 21 days after the halving in 2016.

Source: X
Rekt Capital also revealed back then that Bitcoin had repeated the 2016 history “perfectly,” with the flagship crypto dropping below the bottom of its current Re-Accumulation range. Meanwhile, based on the crypto analyst’s previous analysis, Bitcoin is now headed for the Re-Accumulation phase, which occurs after the halving.
Rekt Capital claimed this period usually lasts up to five months but added that it could be shorter this time. The crypto analyst predicts that BTC may maintain a “Regular sideways range and may not last very long before additional uptrend continuation.” Rekt Capital also suggested that $60,600 would likely be the base of the Re-Accumulation range. 
In a subsequent X post, Rekt Capital hinted that things would likely improve from here on for the flagship crypto. He said, “Bitcoin is showing early-stage signs of slowing down in its sell-side momentum, slowly developing a curl against the $60,000 support.” “$60,000 needs to continue to hold as it has long as it has been holding thus far for this curl to progress and eventually lift up,” he added. 
Rekt Capital noted in another X post that this move to the upside might take time but will eventually happen. According to him, this month and next month may be “unremarkable” for Bitcoin is running out of “unremarkable months” before the “parabolic phase of the cycle begins.”
Source: X
Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of the BitMEX crypto exchange, also echoed a similar sentiment when he stated that Bitcoin had found its local bottom and would range between $60,000 and $70,000 until August. 
$100,000 May Be BTC’s Next Stop After This Phase
Based on price predictions made by several crypto analysts, Bitcoin will likely climb to $100,000 once this period of consolidation is over. One of these analysts is Pseudonymous crypto analyst PlanB, who claimed that BTC hitting this price level this year is “inevitable.” Tom Dunleavy, Partner and Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at MV Capital, had also predicted earlier in the year that Bitcoin would reach $100,000 after the halving. 

Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that Bitcoin will at least come close to this price level even if it doesn’t eventually reach it. He stated that a surge above $66,250 would give the flagship crypto enough strength to move towards $69,150. Martinez claimed that BTC could advance to a new all-time high (ATH) of $92,190 if it eventually breaches that resistance level.

Bitcoin moves out of 'danger zone' - Is a bull run finally on the way? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin shows signs of bullishness, moving out of the post-halving “danger zone.”
Strong support at around $60,000 suggests upward momentum could resume.

Bitcoin [BTC], the leading cryptocurrency, has recently exhibited slight bullish signs, pushing its trading price above the $63,000 mark before settling at around $62,013. 
This movement suggested a tentative recovery from previous lows and a potential shift in market dynamics.
An end of Bitcoin’s riskiest phase?
Crypto market analyst Rekt Capital recently highlighted that Bitcoin might have navigated through the most hazardous phase post-halving, a period typically marked by significant corrections. 
According to historical data, such “danger zones” are often followed by phases of re-accumulation, and Bitcoin’s recent bounce from key support levels might indicate the start of this trend.
Bitcoin’s journey post-halving has been fraught with volatility. After peaking in mid-March, the cryptocurrency experienced a 23% drop, reaching a low of $56,800 on the 1st of May. 
This price point could potentially represent the bottom of the post-halving downturn, marking a pivotal moment for investors and traders alike.
Rekt Capital noted, 
“If $56,000 was not the bottom then this current pullback will have officially equalled the longest retrace in this cycle at 63 days. History however suggests that this current pullback ended at $56000 and 47 days.”
This observation aligned with the asset recent bounce back to over $63,000 yesterday, suggesting a return to a re-accumulation phase.

While historical trends offer a roadmap, they don’t guarantee future outcomes. Market fluctuations and sideways movements are still possible. Yet, RektCapital noted, 
“Bitcoin is showing early-stage signs of slowing down in its sell-side momentum, slowly developing a curl against the ~$60000 support.”
For a sustainable recovery, this support must hold. If successful, Bitcoin could target a return to higher levels, potentially reaching $68,000. 
This projection is underpinned by technical analyses and current market sentiment.

Santiment, a prominent analytics platform, has observed a rise in Bitcoin’s Funding Rate on exchanges like DyDx and Deribit. 
This increase can be a double-edged sword, indicating growing interest but also the risk of repeating past market tops. 
 Santiment disclosed that to avoid a repeat of last week’s downturn, it’s crucial for bullish momentum to be moderate, with an equal or higher rate of short positions compared to longs.

SEC Denies Coinbase's Appeal in Ongoing Securities Lawsuit, Citing Manipulation of Legal Queries



                    

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected Coinbase’s request for an interlocutory appeal in their ongoing legal dispute, citing manipulation of the appeal’s question to fit legal criteria under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). 



The SEC articulated this in a filing with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 10, stating, “Coinbase’s attempts to manipulate the question for appeal to shoehorn it into a certifiable question under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) are self-defeating.”




The core of the dispute revolves around Coinbase’s dissatisfaction with the Howey test, which the SEC uses to determine whether an offering qualifies as a security. 



The SEC’s filing reiterates Coinbase’s antagonism towards the test and existing securities regulations, suggesting that Coinbase structured its business to avoid compliance costs, summarized by the SEC’s remark, “Coinbase just does not like the answer. 



Having made the weather, Coinbase cannot now complain that it is raining.”




On April 12, Coinbase filed for the appeal, challenging the notion that an investment contract necessitates a post-sale obligation. 



This led to a debate over whether this forms a controlling question—a significant legal query that could influence the lawsuit’s outcome.



The SEC opposes this appeal, arguing that Coinbase has failed to present a consistent interpretation of what constitutes a “contractual undertaking.” 



The agency emphasized that no court in the past 80 years has required such post-sale obligations.

According to the SEC, “Coinbase remains unable to advance a single, coherent version of this theory, which it now claims presents a controlling question.”



Moreover, the SEC believes that Coinbase’s proposal of a new legal test and disagreement with the court’s previous decision do not justify the certification of an appeal. 



The filing states, “Interlocutory review is not warranted simply because Coinbase proposes a new legal test and disagrees with the Court’s rejection of that test.”



The SEC initiated legal action against Coinbase in June 2023, accusing the exchange of violating federal securities laws by listing 13 tokens it claims are securities. 



Coinbase maintains that the transactions on its platform do not fall under securities regulations—a stance directly opposed by the SEC, which considers some of these transactions to constitute “investment contracts” under federal law, as noted in court documents dated March 27.

Mark Cuban Says SEC Could Have Prevented FTX if It Had Followed in Japan’s Regulatory Footsteps for Crypto - The Daily Hodl


								Celebrity billionaire Mark Cuban thinks the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could’ve prevented the FTX-related crypto collapse in late 2022.
The Shark Tank star says Japan learned from the infamous 2014 Mt. Gox hack and implemented regulations to protect investors.










“If the SEC had taken the same approach as Japan, there would not have been an FTX issue. Japan FTX didn’t have losses, because they actually learned and put together an approach that put investors first and personal political gain didn’t come into play.” 
Cuban argues that FTX and other collapsed crypto businesses wouldn’t have failed if the SEC had managed to institute audited collateral and segregation of funds requirements. He also argues that other financial sectors present more risk to investors.
“Which of any of the companies not listed on USA exchanges, you know the 12,000 on the pink sheets/OTC (over the counter) that are ‘registered’ via modified requirements in 2021, are going to be groundbreaking and revolutionary?
Which have generated greater losses for speculators over the last 10 years, those penny stocks that trade billions of shares in bankrupt companies or crypto tokens?
Even the scammiest of the scammiest tokens haven’t lost as much money. My point isn’t to say the scam tokens shouldn’t be regulated out of business. They should. My point is that the SEC is really, really bad at protecting investors from scams.”
The billionaire also outlines why he believes in crypto’s utility.
“For crypto: lower cost of capital transfers; immediate collateralized loans; store of value, tokenization of assets; application and retention of royalties to digital assets like books; real-time, low-cost insurance markets; cold storage ownership of significant assets to protect against theft.”

                        The newly launched Solana meme coin ICO for Sealana ($SEAL), themed as the all-American redneck seal, has swiftly attracted over $750,000 in investments within just two weeks.Sealana is at the forefront of a new wave of meme coins that are helping the Solana network challenge Ethereum’s dominance as the go-to blockchain for viral meme coins.Sealana comes off the back of wildly successful predecessors DogWifHat ($WIF), Bonk ($BONK), Book of Meme ($BOME) and Popcat ($POPCAT), all of which quickly rose to become top ten meme coins by market capitalization.He also comes waddling in behind another recent viral Solana meme coin ICO – Slothana ($SLOTH).Sealana’s 420-friendly chain-mate Slothana raised a staggering $15 million in a one-month presale that recently concluded.Now it looks like $SEAL is Solana’s next viral lazy guy meme coin, but the project remains mysterious. There are hints that the team behind it may have been the architects of the infamous and wildly successful Slerf ($SLERF),Crypto’s original sloth meme coin, Slerf, dropped earlier this year but the presale was marred when the team accidentally burned some $10 million in tokens allocated for ICO investors. After going on to see Slothana outraise Slerf, the team is allegedly back with their new offering, Sealana.Although his original home was on Solana, $SEAL is technically a multichain token and anyone with SOL, ETH or BNB in their wallets can purchase it now at a fixed presale price of $0.022 per token.But who exactly is Sealana?Solana’s greatest bedroom patriot is Making Meme Coins Great Again.Doesn’t Solana’s $SEAL Remind You of Someone?
Sealana’s main source of inspiration will be obvious to most who meet his cross-eyed screen gaze, but maybe they won’t connect the dots instantly. That’s because he’s a not-so-subtle Web3 spin on South Park’s viral legend Gamer Guy, aka Fat Computer Nerd.Gamer Guy appeared in the hit cartoon’s side-splitting World of Warcraft episode and became a viral meme all on his own thanks to his milk-bottle glasses, screen-locked stare, messy room and gravity-defying girth.He symbolizes virtually anyone with unhealthy screen time, from the legions of disgruntled keyboard warriors writing sharp, acerbic opinions in internet comments sections, to a kind of Everyman idler.Beached at his desk and ballooning by the day, when he’s not making degen Solana trades, Sealana’s roving flippers fumble across his desk for sustenance of chips and tinned tuna.Why does the hungry $SEAL love Solana so much? Because crypto’s second-most commercially important blockchain has established itself as the best Layer 1 blockchain to launch high-volume meme coins.The market is hungry for more and Sealana feels a tingling in his blubber. His native network, Solana, could flip BNB to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Solana currently hosts a digital economy storing over $4.149 billion in total value locked (TVL) across various apps and financial services, with 1.16 million active users transacting daily and over 2,500 monthly active developers.There are also some potentially market moving events ahead that could add billions to the Solana network across all its projects.VIDEOThe Halving and ETF Effects
Recent disappointing crypto prices after some early-year rallies reflect a market that is briefly consolidating before the effects of a Bitcoin software update known as “the halving” become apparent. If analysts are right, then $SEAL and other Solana meme coins could attract some feverish speculation in the coming year.That’s because the halving slashed mining rewards from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125, effectively halving the issuance of new BTC.Now, with Bitcoin setting new all-time highs this year after the US approval of spot Bitcoin investment products back in January, many analysts say crypto is set to become much more valuable, thanks to the bottlenecked new supply.The past three halvings have added significant value to the market well within a year of the update.Market-wide green candles will prompt further meme coin gold rushes in the near future. This time, Solana tokens will be at the forefront of the rallies.The potential US approval of Ethereum ETFs on Thursday next week could also be a boon for meme coins like $SEAL on Solana, the number one “Ethereum-killer”.Don’t ignore the patriotic call to Make Meme Coins Great Again.

Sealana will be thanking you when he leaves mom’s basement.Follow the latest developments on Sealana’s X account.Buy Solana’s laziest $SEAL at the official website here.

&nbsp

&nbsp
The current state of the Bitcoin market, particularly the expected price outcome, has been a major topic of conversation amongst community members.



While sentiments are mixed, with most leaning towards a bearish end, a prominent analyst has revealed that despite Bitcoin printing red candles, the bull market has not yet reached its peak. The pseudonymous analyst told his 126.9k followers that Bitcoin is now in correction mode, regardless of the indicators flashing on the technical charts.



However, the asset could continue in a downward correction, causing Bitcoin to hit lower levels. Notably, Bitcoin plunged to the $63,000 price zone as selling pressure rose during the weekend. Should the bear trend continue, Bitcoin could decline to $50,000. 







Nonetheless, the analyst added that the downward correction is expected to be temporary. In a previous analysis, the predictions from April 2nd summarily read “double top, decreasing RSI, no bullish divergence in sight. More downside: ” So far, the predictions have been accurate, as BTC has stayed in the corrective channel.



Mass adoption and inflation to impact Bitcoin’s price



Addressing the concerns raised about the underwhelming post-halving Bitcoin performance, the analysis offered a historical perspective, noting that it is typical for Bitcoin bulls to slow down. The analyst stated that the bull market will kick in in a few months or weeks.

&nbsp



Outlining the metrics that revealed the market was still bullish, the analyst pointed to the 1-year SMA, which “shows that we are still in the very, very green zone here.”



Breaking down how deep the market can go, the analyst is quoted saying, 



“How deep can we go? As we stated in our latest thread, we have several layers of support: A) 60k, B) 56k, and C) 52K. If the first two break, there are strong signs that 52k will be reached before we finally move up higher, like the amount of liquidity lying in this area. Also, as seen in the upper image, this region coincides with the 61.8 Fib Retracement (the golden pocket) and should serve as a resistance.”



On the flip side, the analyst made a bullish call, asserting that Bitcoin will surge past $200,000 at the cycle’s peak due to an increase in institutional adoption and the constant rise in inflation. While the near-term target sits at >$100k, the cycle is expected to peak during the 3rd quarter of 2025.

Crypto bill update: What legislation is making its way forward? - Blockworks


As the 2024 election looms, crypto-focused legislation is starting to make its way through the US House. But roadblocks in the Senate still loom. 
House members last week approved joint resolution 109 — which would invalidate the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 — in a 228-182 vote. It’s the first time a crypto bill has made it to and passed the House in a floor vote. 
The resolution now moves on to the Senate, where the Democrat majority makes it unlikely to pass, although there were 21 Democrats who voted against their party and in favor of the resolution in the House. If the legislation does make it past the Senate, however, the Biden administration has said the president will veto the resolution.

​​“Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty,” the White House wrote in a statement last week. 
The House has passed several crypto bills out of Committee, but has failed to bring the vast majority of them to the floor for a full vote. The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, the Keep Your Coins Act and the Financial Technology Protection Act all survived markup, but have not been scheduled for a full vote. 
The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, known as the FIT act, last week advanced to the House Committee on Rules. It should be heading for a floor vote later this month, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., said.  
In the Senate, crypto-related bills, even those with bipartisan support, have yet to grab the interest of committee heads, who would need to add markups to their respective agendas. 
The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, backed by Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Roger Marshall, R-Kan., Joe Manchin, D-W.V., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has been the topic of several Senate Banking Committee hearings, but has not been voted on or marked up. 
“At the end of the day, Elizabeth Warren has a lot of power right now in the Biden administration, she’s got a lot of influence over who the appointees are,” Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith said last month at a Brown Rudnick event in New York. “But she hasn’t always been influential in actually getting legislation passed.” 
Longtime collaborators Sens. Cynthia Lummis,  R-Wyom., and Kristen Gillibrand, D-N.Y., last summer brought a revamped version of their Responsible Financial Innovation Act to the Senate floor, but the bill has not progressed. 
The Senate received joint resolution 109 last week but has not yet scheduled a date to vote. Both the Senate and House are scheduled to recess on May 24 until June 3.

Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin and Famous Billionaire Peter Thiel Invested Millions of Dollars in This Cryptocurrency Project! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cryptocurrency-based prediction platform Polymarket has raised $45 million in a series B funding round from major investors.
It was stated that important names such as Ethereum (ETH) founder Vitalik Buterin, 1confirmation, ParaFi and Dragonfly Capital participated in the financing round led by famous billionaire Peter Thiel's Founders Fund.


It was not disclosed how much the company was valued after the financing round.
Polymarket co-founder Joey Krug said in a statement to The Block:






“Polymarket has finally brought its vision of prediction markets to reality, an opportunity we have been passionately awaiting for years.
The tangible benefits of using Polymarket as a complement to consuming news on social and mainstream media were clear. “It became clear to us that Polymarket was the winner in this market.”

Polymarket claims that approximately $202 million worth of predictions have been made for 2024 so far through the platform.
Late last year, Bitwise analysts predicted that a record $100 million would be invested in crypto-based prediction markets (of which Polymarket is by far the largest) in 2024.

‘Notcoin’ Airdrop Claim Opens as Binance Users Stake $14 Billion for NOT Rewards - Decrypt

The NOT token of viral Telegram-based game Notcoin will be listed on Thursday, May 16 via multiple crypto exchanges—and in advance of the rollout, developer Open Builders opened up the in-game claim process for all players early Tuesday.Some 35 million players of the clicker game can now choose what to do with their earned NOT tokens, which are being awarded at a 1,000-to-1 ratio based on the in-game coins they mined earlier this year. So if you mined 100,000 in-game coins, then you’ll be able to claim 100 NOT tokens on The Open Network (TON).Players deposit their NOT from the game to the crypto exchanges Binance, OKX, or Bybit, or to the Wallet app on Telegram. Deposits are available throughout the day Tuesday, but will be paused on Wednesday ahead of the token listing.Notcoin players can also stake their tokens, letting them earn higher status levels that “give you access to better conditions and exclusive projects,” according to an official Telegram post. Come Thursday, players will also have the option to withdraw NOT to a self-custody wallet.Ahead of the listing, Binance and OKX both launched staking reward campaigns for NOT on Monday that let users of each crypto exchange earn a share of Notcoin tokens. In total, the exchanges will give out more than 4 billion NOT—over 4% of the total supply.Binance has the biggest chunk of that to offer, with over 3 billion NOT available through its Launchpool campaign—and customers are showing strong early enthusiasm. Users have already staked about $13.7 billion worth of Binance Coin (BNB) and the FDUSD stablecoin, with the tally briefly rising above $14 billion on Monday.Earlier Launchpool campaigns for gaming tokens Pixels (PIXEL) and Portal (PORTAL) similarly commanded several billion dollars’ worth of staking interest apiece, and the tokens both debuted to sizable market caps.Will Notcoin similarly find its place in the ranking of the top gaming tokens launched in 2024? We’ll find out on Thursday once the token listing goes live.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Inflation Data Comes in Hot as GameStop and GME-Inspired Memecoin on Solana Continue Ripping Higher - The Daily Hodl


								Gamestop and a GME-inspired memecoin are rallying harder as hotter-than-expected inflation data boosts risk appetite in crypto and stocks.
The producer price index (PPI), which measures what producers receive for their goods, increased 0.5% in April and was up 2.2% on a 12-month basis, according to the latest release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).










It was the biggest gain so far this year, and was higher than the forecasted 0.2%.
Meanwhile, stock indices have pushed slightly higher as Wall Street digests the data, and Gamestop, the meme stock that exploded in 2021 causing hedge funds to lose large amounts of capital, is continuing its resurgence following the return of the movement’s leader, “Roaring Kitty.”
GME opened the day over $64, up more than 142% from yesterday. It has since dropped down to $42, still 164% from where it finished last week.
A memecoin on Solana (SOL), which also uses the GME ticker symbol, is currently up over 2266.13% in the last seven days, prompting analysts to ask whether markets are entering another frothy altcoin season similar to the last bull market cycle of 2021.
Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Psycho tells his 501,000 followers on the social media platform X that GME won’t simply be an “outlier.”
“Gamestop will not be the outlier here. Study 2019-2021 & think about where that money will flow next.”
The analyst says that stocks will soon “mimic 2019-2021 dynamics,” and that “2024 should be interesting.”
Others aren’t as convinced. Closely followed analyst The Flow Horse tells his 215,000 followers on the social media platform X that the hype around GME will likely be over by next week.
“Prediction.
The GME stuff is over by next week and crypto Twitter is frantically searching for any narrative rather than just waiting for better setups again.
Unless we start seeing some massive short interest build, because right now it isn’t even close to where it was during the last mania.”

Is Worldcoin About to Crash? Shortseller Reveals Bearish Case - DailyCoin


        

Analyst targets Worldcoin in short seller case.



Calls out Worldcoin insiders. 



Expected 4% daily inflation from VC and team unlocks. 




Worldcoin, a crypto project with founders including OpenAI’s Sam Altman, has faced intense scrutiny. Most notably, this has centered around the potential privacy-harming features of its iris-scanning tech. 



However, most recently, one analyst highlighted the issues with its promise of a universal basic income. Rather than spreading the wealth around the world, Worldcoin is accused of benefiting investors and other insiders. 



Worldcoin Favors Insiders Over Users, Claims DeFi²



On Monday, May 13, crypto analyst DeFi² made a short seller’s case for Worldcoin, pointing out several factors that could lead to a significant devaluation. In particular, these concern Worldcoin’s tokenomics which he claims heavily favor insiders. 




“In addition to being a deceptive project with no real link to OpenAI,” DeFi² claims that many investors are unaware of “how aggressively this coin is likely to be sold off as unlocks continue to ramp up in the coming months.”



DeFi² points out that Worldcoin has set a very aggressive daily emission rate of 0.6%. According to DeFi², these emissions are already contributing to a steady devaluation of the token. For instance, the token is down 50% from its March peak at $10,78.



Source: CoinMarketCap



This situation is exacerbated by the Worldcoin Foundation’s decision to sell $200 million worth of tokens to trading firms, which will dilute the existing circulating supply by 18%. This decision, DeFi² notes, also put in question Worldcoin’s commitment to its users and their privacy. 




Moreover, in just 70 days, about 4% of the tokens intended for the team and the venture capital will unlock. The resulting sell pressure from these insiders could lead to nearly $50 million worth of tokens being sold daily. This would naturally put enormous sell pressure on the token, depressing its price. 



Worldcoin Down Almost 10% After the Revelations



The revelations by DeFi² have apparently convinced at least some investors of Worldcoin’s issues. After he published his report, Worldcoin fell to $5.15, down 9.79% in just 24 hours from $5.75. Still, the project has increased yearly, posting a 200% gain since last year.  



Designed to provide an infrastructure for future digital identity, Worldcoin plans to scan the irises of billions of people around the world. The aim is to create a network that can distinguish between real people and bots, solving a major issue plaguing decentralized networks since their inception. 



However, Worlcoin has faced significant criticism over its supposed privacy-harming features, leading to bans in several countries, including Kenya and Spain. The project also faces investigations in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Its regulatory woes were further exasperated by the data breach on May 2023, which the company experienced, leading to the exposure of sensitive user data. 



On the Flipside




Despite not currently being active in Worldcoin, Sam Altman was a key figure in its founding. As late as 2023, Altman was fundraising for Tools for Humanity, the organization behind Worldcoin.  



Short selling is one of the riskiest strategies in finance. Unlike long positions, which can only ever go as low as zero, a short contract can leave a short in the hole for more than the total funds they invested. 




Why This Matters



Understanding the tokenomics of any project, including Worldcoin, is crucial for crypto investors. Even the best projects can be bad investments if their tokenomics are lacking.

Bitcoin Hashrate Plunges 11% As Miner Profits At 3-Year Lows


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin mining hashrate has registered a decrease of 11% recently as miner profitability has dropped to a 3-year low.
Bitcoin Miners Haven’t Been Under This Much Stress In 3 Years
As pointed out by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a post on X, Bitcoin miners are being significantly underpaid right now. The indicator of relevance here is the “miner profit/loss sustainability,” which basically tells us whether the miner revenues are fair or not currently.

Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in this BTC metric over the last few years:

The value of the metric seems to have been quite negative in recent weeks | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin miner profit/loss sustainability had been at positive levels earlier when the rally towards the new all-time high had occurred.
Miners make their income from two sources: the block rewards that they receive for solving blocks on the network and the transaction fees that they get as compensation for handling individual transfers.
During rallies, transfer fees can spike due to high network activity and block rewards become more valuable as a result of the rising BTC price. As such, it’s not surprising that the profitability of these chain validators was at notable levels during the earlier surge.
Recently, however, the indicator’s value has plunged deep into the negative territory, implying miners have become extremely underpaid. Bitcoin has gone through some bearish price action in this period, but the lower spot value isn’t the only reason that miner financials have now come under stress.
The much-anticipated Halving that occurred last month would be the much bigger factor at play here. During this event, BTC’s block rewards were permanently slashed in half, so it’s easy to see how it would affect mining economics.
Interestingly enough, the Halving day itself saw pretty high revenues for miners, with the miner profit/loss sustainability shooting into the overpaid territory, as is visible by the lone spike in the chart. This was a result of the arrival of Runes on the network.
This new protocol, which allows users to mint fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network, saw immediate popularity, and the resulting transaction activity sent blockchain fees soaring. However, the hype couldn’t last for too long, though, and transaction fees have once again returned back to lower levels.

The halved rewards combined with the relatively low fees are why miner profitability has taken such a hit. “This is likely to cause substantial strain, especially for less efficient miners,” notes Maartunn.
It would appear that some of the miners under stress have already started pulling out, as the Bitcoin hashrate, a measure of the computing power connected to the network by the miners, has seen a decline of 11% in its 7-day average chart since the all-time high set alongside the Halving.

Looks like the value of the metric has been declining recently | Source: Blockchain.com
Miners can now only hope for the BTC price to see enough surge so as to offset the revenue decrease caused by the Halving, or for the transaction fees to perhaps see another boom.
BTC Price
Bitcoin has seen yet another recovery rally fizzle out as the asset’s price has dropped to $61,700 after having returned back above $63,000 yesterday.

Short squeeze alert for two cryptocurrencies this week


High open interest volume, negative funding rates, and upward accumulated liquidations can indicate a potential short squeeze for cryptocurrencies. In particular, Finbold spotted significant indicators for BNB Chain (BNB) and Toncoin (TON), signaling a short squeeze could happen soon.
The cryptocurrency market has followed Bitcoin (BTC) in a downtrend since April 9. The leading digital asset trades at $61,405, below its 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA), which has become resistance. Moreover, it is condensed between the 30-EMA and a 3-month range’s bottom at the psychological support of $60,000.
This diminishing volatility will soon ignite an aggressive movement either upwards or downwards. Other cryptocurrencies will likely follow the move, which could trigger a short squeeze for some coins.

Short squeeze alert: BNB Chain (BNB)
First, BNB has the seventh-largest open interest and the second-highest negative funding rate in the market. Short sellers pay a 64% APR to long-position traders as of this writing due to the higher weight of opened-short positions.
Funding Rate Heatmap: BNB. Source: CoinGlass
Therefore, a short squeeze is likely and could drive BNB to a relevant liquidation pool at nearly $610 per token. This would result in around 5% gains for traders entering at current prices.

Toncoin (TON) with the worst negative funding rate
Meanwhile, Toncoin has a negative funding rate of 111.95%, the worst among cryptocurrency derivatives, despite a lower open interest. If the downtrend reverts, this data makes TON a potential candidate for a short squeeze this week.
Funding Rate Heatmap: TON. Source: CoinGlass
Interestingly, Telegram’s crypto project has two notable liquidity pools for short liquidations. First at $7.2 and the second at $7.4 per token. These are two short-term targets for TON, currently trading at $6.7. A bull rally could make Toncoin surge by 10% in a few hours, aiming for longer time frames later.

However, other factors could prevent the forecasted trend reversal and short squeezes for BTC, BNB, TON, or other cryptocurrencies. Traders must remain cautious while opening leveraged positions and speculating in this volatile landscape.

Did Producer Price Inflation Data Cause Bitcoin To Slide 2%? - Benzinga

April Producer Price Inflation (PPI) increased by 0.5% month-over-month, causing cryptocurrency markets to slide on Tuesday.What Happened: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell commented on the data, saying "I wouldn't call it hot. I would call it sort of mixed." According to Nick Timiraos, Chief economics correspondent of the Wall Street Journal, the impact on the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) from the Producer Price Index (PPI) is likely offset, as lower airfares and healthcare costs are expected to balance out the increased costs in the financial services subcomponent.Cryptocurrencies took a hit, with some AI-related cryptocurrencies like Worldcoin WLD/USD and Render RNDR/USD, as well as meme coins like Dogwifhat WIF/USD being the top losers. Cryptocurrency PriceGains +/-Bitcoin BTC/USD$61,432.98-2.1%Ethereum ETH/USD$2,892.34-2.0%Solana SOL/USD$142.92-3.1%Dogecoin DOGE/USD$0.1466-3.7%Also Read: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Pumped And Retraced After The Last Inflation Data Release — What To Expect This Month?Why It Matters: The crypto community was undecided on what the new data means for price action going forward. Crypto trader ShardiB2 reaffirmed Powell's statement, seeing "Higher for longer," with reference to the Fed’s interest rate policy.Crypto Kaduna sees the PPI numbers forcing the Federal Reserve into a dovish position on interest rates, commenting, "If he's hawkish, USD/JPY will rally, and Japan might be forced to sell U.S. treasuries. The U.S. doesn't want that to happen."Crypto trader and analyst El Crypto Prof highlighted Bitcoin's weekly chart, suggesting to either “sell everything here” or analyze Bitcoin’s historic price action, presumably in anticipation of further upside.Crypto technical chart analyst Ali Martinez anticipates a price rebound for Bitcoin.What’s Next: After the PPI data, attention turns towards Wednesday’s upcoming CPI data release, expected to come in at 3.4%, below the prior month's 3.5%.The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Bitcoin Up 3%: What Will Inflation Data And Powell Speech Bring This Week?Image: Shutterstock

Stablecoins bots are a feature, not a bug - Blockworks


A Bloomberg headline recently claimed that “more than 90% of stablecoin transactions aren’t from real users,” sparking concern about the authenticity of transactions within the blockchain ecosystem. 
This isn’t the first time that the digital assets industry has faced scrutiny about an apparent lack of authenticity in transactions. Last year, the SEC accused Binance.US of inflating trading volumes. Way back in 2019, a study by Bitwise found that 95% of spot bitcoin trading volume by unregulated exchanges was faked. Both findings have their detractors.
This isn’t the first moral panic around crypto’s legitimacy, and it won’t be the last.
However, a deeper dive into this “more than 90%” figure reveals a more nuanced narrative. A narrative, in fact, that oversells the fraudulent nature of crypto and severely undersells the transformative nature of blockchain technology.
The cited source for this headline, a collaboration between Allium and VISA, introduces a dashboard that attempts to differentiate between “organic” stablecoin transactions initiated by end consumers and businesses versus transactions orchestrated by computer programs. 
This differentiation, while well-intentioned, fails to grasp the unique execution model of blockchain technology.
Blockchain technology operates on a fundamentally different paradigm compared to traditional payment rails. At its core, blockchains are decentralized, immutable ledgers maintained by a network of nodes. Transactions on blockchains are executed through smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with contract terms directly written into code.
Unlike centralized payment systems where transactions are initiated and validated by trusted intermediaries, blockchain transactions are triggered by external actions interacting with smart contracts. These actions can be programmatically executed by automated processes — commonly referred to as bots — without the need to extend any trust to the bots.
Read more from our opinion section: You’re still rolling your own crypto. You need to stop.
Bots play a crucial role in facilitating efficient and secure transactions on blockchains. They serve various functions, from optimizing transaction fees to executing complex financial operations on behalf of users. They are not the equivalent of social media “bots” like those that now plague Elon Musk’s X.
With that in mind, let’s explore some practical examples of bot-initiated stablecoin transactions:
1. Gas payment services: With blockchain networks like Ethereum, users must pay gas fees to execute transactions. Paymasters are services that cover these gas fees on behalf of users, ensuring seamless transaction execution without requiring the user to own the underlying transactional token.
2. Recurring payments: Smart contracts can be programmed to execute recurring payments based on predefined conditions set by users. While authorized by users, the execution of these payments is automated through smart contract logic initiated by bots.
3. Coupon payments for tokenized bonds: In DeFi, tokenized bonds can automate coupon payments to bondholders through smart contracts, ensuring timely and transparent distribution of interest payments. Smart contracts are unable to initiate future coupon payments, so bots must be the initiators of the payments. Importantly, the bots are trustless in the sense that they never have custody of the funds being paid.
4. Intent-based trading: Users can express their trading intentions, e.g., swapping a token for a stablecoin, by providing a digital signature to a bot through user interfaces. Bots then leverage DEXs to identify the best trade routes and execute transactions on behalf of users, optimizing for efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The blockchain ensures that the bots are unable to do anything other than what was expressed by the user.
5. Rollups and layer-2 solutions: Scaling solutions like rollups enable off-chain transaction aggregation while settling final balances on the main blockchain. Bots can initiate transactions on these layer-2 solutions, streamlining transaction throughput and reducing costs.
No cause for alarm
The dominance of bot-initiated transactions in stablecoin flows is not a cause for alarm, but a testament to the disruptive capabilities of blockchains. It is a feature, not a bug. 
Automation empowers developers to create sophisticated financial applications. For instance, imagine a future where flash loans are used for daily mortgage refinancing, facilitated entirely through automated smart contract execution initiated by bots. This level of automation reduces operational overhead and introduces unprecedented accessibility to financial services.
The dominance of bot-initiated stablecoin transactions is a sign of the maturation of blockchains into a robust infrastructure for automated financial interactions. Rather than viewing bots as a detractor of “real” transactions, we should celebrate their role in enhancing user experience and unlocking new use cases. Embracing automation on blockchains enhances efficiency and fosters innovation across diverse industries. 
As we navigate the evolving landscape of blockchain-based payments, it’s essential to revisit our understanding of what constitutes a “real” transaction.
In traditional finance, payments are often equated with direct human interaction. However, blockchain’s execution model introduces a paradigm shift where transactions are initiated and executed through autonomous code. 
That isn’t to say that fraudulent transactions don’t exist, or that trading volumes aren’t ever inflated — but a casual read-across from traditional finance to DeFi is rarely so easy.

Investors Shift From Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) Meme Coins to Online Casino Extraordinaire Rollblock (RBLK) | NewsBTC


																The crypto market is increasingly moving away from Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) meme coins. Instead, traders are switching focus to coins with utility as utility season beckons. In the lead of such a shift is Rollblock (RBLK) – a Stage 1 presale star that many analysts hint to become the next $1 break out crypto star in 2024.
Solana (SOL) Reveals Arcium
Solana (SOL) has recently been making waves in the crypto market. Notably, Solana announced that the first parallelized confidential computing network—Arcium—will soon enter its ecosystem. This bullish Solana news may trigger a rally for this crypto, which has soared 587% in the past year alone.
The technical analysis of the Solana crypto shows many bullish signals. For example, SOL is now trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs while boasting 16 green technical indicators. Thus, experts predict a potential jump to $151 for Solana within Q2 of 2024. However, many SOL-based meme coins like MYRO remain red on the price charts.
Ethereum Price Analysis: Showing Bullish Signs
Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) meme coins are also facing some trouble, as Shiba Inu and Floki are showing red on the one-month charts. However, Ethereum continues its growth in the crypto market, as CoinMarketCap data shows it jumped 60% on the YTD chart. Simultaneously, its market cap surged from $217B to $356B at that same time.
The technical analysis of Ethereum also paints a bullish picture. Currently, Ethereum is trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. Also, the Stoch RSI signal sits at 16.3 in the buy zone. As a result, market analysts have made a bullish Ethereum price prediction. They forecast a surge to $3,600 before Q2 of 2024 ends.
Rollblock (RBLK): Among the Best Coins To Invest In
Rollblock (RBLK) is becoming one of the top crypto coins and it is making a splash in the market with its presale performance. It has already sold over 12M tokens and raised almost $125K, with projections hinting at $600K before May 2024 ends. This indicates that traders all over the world are in great demand for this unique GambleFi protocol.
Rollblock aims to become a major player in the online gambling sector, which is now worth $450B. This is why it launched a unique online crypto casino that combines the best decentralization and centralization features. As a result, Rollblock lets you sign up using an email only and no KYC checks or extra downloads are required—full anonymity for all.
The RBLK utility token is the fuel of this platform, offering holding benefits such as regular rakebacks and passive income opportunities. In fact, Rollblock’s unique revenue-sharing model means that up to 30% of its weeklt earnings will go to RBLK holders in the form of token buy backs. Half of those tokens are burned from the supply forever and the other half will be used to offer investors some of the best staking rewards available in the crypto space.
At the moment, RBLK is worth only $0.01 in Stage 1 of its presale. However, more price pumps will occur as the presale advances. Market analysts even predict a potential rise to $1 once a Tier-1 CEX lists RBLK in Q3 of 2024. With this prediction, RBLK emerges as the best crypto investment right now.
Why Are Solana and Ethereum Traders Gravitating Towards Rollblock?
The $10M market cap for Rollblock makes it attractive to Solana and Ethereum traders, who can anticipate much larger returns. RBLK needs way less new funds for its price to skyrocket than its peers, so traders view RBLK as one of the best cryptos to invest in.

Is Friend.Tech Undervalued? | Bankless


Friend.tech's much-anticipated token launch and product revamp both had rocky debuts last week. The community faced issues with a buggy token airdrop process, non-functional new features, and a multi-step claim process requiring people to interact with the protocol’s new features. As a result, its token dropped to a low of $0.93 — a far cry from the pre-market price of $10. The token then rebounded to a local top of $3.14 amid a revenge rally that claimed the contentious launch was all part of Racer’s master plan. Well, the token is now trading around $1.66 with a market cap just above $155 million. On Crypto Twitter, the debate is still raging over whether FRIEND remains undervalued, with strong calls and cases made from both sides. While many factors, like the token’s market cap relative to the amount of hype the project has generated, hint at substantial upside, usage data tells a different story. Let's present these cases side by side, undervalued versus overvalued — for you to decide between! Let’s begin 👇
Yes, Friend.Tech is UndervaluedFirst, let's take the bull case.The growth case for FRIEND rests on its close ties to Base, its fair launch, the low market cap, strong leadership, and app utility.FRIEND = Base: Arguably the project that kicked off Base last year, FRIEND can be seen as the most “Base” token – an aggregate proxy to the chain's success. It is the native token of its buzziest app, a social token for the social/consumer chain. For the time being, Base claims that they will not launch a token potentially leaving room for FRIEND's status to grow.Fair Launch, Low Market Cap: FRIEND has an awfully low market cap (~$155M) for a project backed by Paradigm, one of the industry’s most prominent VCs, with no supply currently reserved for its investors. Racer = Personality Hire: Most well-performing projects tend to have had strong personalities act as leaders for the community to coordinate around. Racer, friend.tech’s founder, embodies this role as a polarizing online figure with loyal supporters and loud-spoken critics.Needed for Clubs: Keys for clubs, V2’s new group chat feature, are priced in FRIEND, giving the token a function rather than the “vote in governance” use case so blithely tossed around. Together, these factors show FRIEND’s unique position within the Base ecosystem, and make a strong case for the token.Nope, Friend.Tech Is OvervaluedOn the other hand, data suggests a decline in activity on the platform — evident in decreasing token volumes, club creation, and stagnating liquidity.Token Volume Decreasing: Since its launch, FRIEND volume, a prerequisite to price action as volume signals plentiful liquidity necessary for price increases, has trended down significantly, currently sitting around $1.5M compared to ~$6.5M on the first day. One of the disadvantages of only allowing your token to be traded on one DEX.Clubs Created Declining: Creation of Clubs, V2's new group chat feature, has stalled. While this may be a sign of clubs maturing and people getting settled into their favorite groups, it also comes amid the release of new features, potentially signaling low demand for this new format.FRIEND Liquidity Stagnating: As previously mentioned, liquidity proves crucial for token growth and price action. Despite sizable incentives for providing liquidity for FRIEND on Bunnyswap, FT’s native DEX, liquidity for the token looks to have plateaued, potentially signaling a ceiling on price action, at least for now.These points indicate declining user activity, reduced trading volume, and stagnating liquidity, suggesting that FRIEND may be overvalued despite its initial hated rally.@whale_hunter on DuneBuilding a NarrativeWhile a qualitative case can be made that FRIEND is undervalued, quantitative factors point to an overvalued token. While friend.tech continues to roll out features like fee sharing with Presidents, pinned groups, and new casual bonding curves, these are not increasing activity. Before V2’s launch, Racer teased upgrades like Money Clubs for managing shared treasuries, minting on-chain collectibles, and more dynamic Chatrooms with reactions, tagging, notifications, pinned messages, raffles, and a referral program.While not yet released or confirmed on the roadmap, meme clubs and keydrops have been confirmed, the former of which could be a significantly bullish catalyst for friend.tech if they allow clubs to launch their own memecoins on Bunnyswap.
All in all, the debate over Friend.tech's value continues. While FRIEND’s status on Base, low market cap, headline-grabbing founder, and increasing use cases for joining clubs all look to be reasons for growth, declining activity, lower token volume, and stagnating liquidity say otherwise. As Friend.tech rolls out new features and continues to evolve, its true value could become clearer. For now, the market remains divided on whether FRIEND is a hidden gem or a risky bet. In that case, it could be best to find clubs you like chatting in on the app and use it for, gasp, just that.

UK shuts down 'trust me bro' crypto firm that promoted $1.7B Ponzi


A UK-based crypto advice firm that told customers their investments were “100 certy” and to “trust me bro” was shut down by the country’s High Court last month following an investigation into investor losses.
Amey Finance Academy, helmed by sole director and self-proclaimed ‘wealth creation expert’ Desmond Amey, was wound up by the UK’s Insolvency Service on April 30 after it “recklessly persuaded individuals to invest in cryptocurrency schemes and mislead them about the risks of doing so.”
It also failed to hand over adequate records and displayed a lack of transparency that prevented the Insolvency Service from establishing the true extent of its activities.
Among those who lost their investment was one investor who was told by Amey that their investment wouldn’t drop below 90%. They ended up losing all of their money.
In WhatsApp messages seen by the Insolvency Service, Amey told another investor that the investments were “100 certy” and to “trust me bro.”
Amey Finance Academy shilled Ponzi with fake CEO
Among the projects promoted by Amey was HyperFund — later, Hyperverse — a Ponzi scheme that went unchecked by Australian authorities for two years, despite defrauding investors out of $1.7 billion.
The scheme, that was also fronted by a fake CEO, was first referred by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to the country’s Victoria police in 2020 for “possible fraud offences.”
However, it wasn’t until two years later in January 2022, that Victoria Police referred it back to ASIC.

The company was also investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which charged its founder Sam Lee with fraud in January 2024.
When interviewed about HyperFund, Amey claimed he only used the company’s bank account to help people buying crypto via a separate company called Bleuguava.
He also used a false email signature that wrongly claimed he was authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, and claimed in a 2023 YouTube video that he maintained an office at 1 Canada Square at Canary Wharf in London. He’d actually been evicted for non-payment of rent in January of that year.

Welcome to the United Kingdom - Please hand over your crypto

Most of us view it as tyrannical or indefensible when a government seizes someone’s assets without arresting them or even charging them with a crime. But thanks to a law that went into effect in April, that’s the new reality facing cryptocurrency owners in the United Kingdom.The change, which came into effect on April 26, is the result of amendments to the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (ECCTA), which amended confiscation regimes in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA). U.K. police and the National Crime Agency (NCA) may now seize crypto assets from suspects without arresting them.In simple terms, the change means that the authorities can seize crypto from those suspected of criminal activity. The authorities will also have the power to seize physical items related to crypto investigations, such as flash drives and written passwords, and to “destroy” a crypto asset if returning it to circulation is not considered to be conducive to the public good.How will crypto be 'destroyed'? No one knowsExactly how such assets will be destroyed has not been detailed. Regulators issued a circular on how to implement the law, but it is far from complete. It details the scenarios in which the powers of destruction can be exercised but does not provide details on the practicalities of how such destruction will take place. Related: ‘Open-source’ CBDCs aren’t going to protect you from governmentCryptocurrencies have been used for years by criminal gangs to launder the proceeds of crime. Supporters of the new measures suggest they will help to combat some of that laundering.Cover page of the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency ActHowever, if police begin seizing cryptocurrencies without their victims with a crime, it is hard to see their approach as anything more than an asset-grab powered by a presumption of guilt without evidence. Civil seizures that do not require charging victims with an offense has been a contentious issue in the U.K. for years. When the police suspect an individual of criminal activity, they have the power to seize assets — such as cash, vehicles and now crypto — related to the suspected criminal activity while conducting their investigation. These powers are widely and regularly used by law enforcement agencies in the country.While it is unsurprising to see this approach expanded to crypto, authorities may now use this power as a means of carrying out unjustified — but legal — seizures. The approach does not acknowledge a presumption of innocence. The door is now open for U.K. authorities to abuse their power in targeting crypto holders, and exploited for personal or political motives.Now that the police or NCA no longer require the evidence to carry out an arrest before such a seizure, these new powers can be utilized at an earlier stage – which will increase the likelihood of seizing suspected proceeds of crime. But taking such action at an earlier stage may also increase the possibility of such seizures being carried out with less grounds for doing so than would previously have been the case. And that surely increases the possibility of mistakes being made.The law advises officials to "destroy" crypto if it "is not collected within a year of its release," but fails to note that crypto is indestructible. Source: Circular on the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency ActPowers have also been granted to law enforcement agencies allowing them to sell seized crypto assets for cash. But market fluctuation is a major issue in the crypto market. So while these powers enable law enforcement agencies to sell crypto assets before they devalue, there is also the risk that they may be sold prematurely — just before the value of that crypto asset skyrockets. This could then mean that the victim of the original offense — whose assets were being held in crypto by criminals prior to seizure — may lose out on potentially huge increases in value. This is another reason that law enforcement will need to use these new powers with the utmost caution.Related: Solana illustrates the dark side of monolithic blockchainsThe most immediate use for these new powers will be for offenses relating to fraud and drugs. Current civil remedies for victims of fraud through the High Court can be costly and time consuming. There is the hope that these new powers afforded to law enforcement will go some way to changing that. They may also be effective in preventing the swift dissipation of assets generated by large-scale drug operations.The focus on crypto-related offenses should involve development of the common law. The Law Commission Digital Assets Report, published in June 2023, highlighted the progress made by the judiciary in this regard and championed the development of the common law. But the common law alone has been unable to address all the problems, so it remains unclear exactly why it has taken so long for parliament to enact these new powers in response to this.While law enforcement may welcome the changes, it is concerning that the ECCTA does not set out powers for U.K. law enforcement to share information with other agencies globally when crypto assets are being transferred to other jurisdictions. This creates a risk that U.K. police will be powerless to regain control of such assets if they are transferred out of their jurisdiction.The bottom line is that the new seizure regime compromises individual civil liberties, and we’ll soon find how vigorously authorities plan to use it to undermine our traditional right to due process.Syed Rahman is a guest columnist for Cointelegraph and a partner at Rahman Ravelli, a law firm in the United Kingdom, where he represents clients in commercial and financial disputes and major white-collar crime cases.

Surprise Altcoin Unexpectedly Surpasses Solana in User Count - Bitcoin Sistemi


The cryptocurrency market witnessed interesting data today.
According to on-chain data, the number of daily users of the Arbitrum (ARB) network has exceeded the number of daily users of Solana, which has been in the top ranks for a long time.


Arbitrum is known as a layer-2 network that aims to increase the scalability of Ethereum. Solana, on the other hand, is a layer-1 Blockchain.
When the number of daily active users is examined, 901 thousand Arbitrum users were active in the last 24 hours, while this number was 841 thousand for Solana.






On the other hand, in the race between the two, the Solana network is still ahead of Arbitrum in terms of total key value (TVL). While Solana's TVL is around 4.14 billion dollars, Arbitrum's data is around 2.56 billion dollars. However, while Solana's total market value is $64 billion, Arbitrum's is only $2.5 billion.
In the race for the number of active users in the last 24 hours, neither altcoin is at the top of the list. Tron is by far the first with 2.13 million users, while Polygon and BSC are in the second and third places, respectively. Then comes Arbitrum and Solana.

Price prediction for PEPE amid new all-time high


In a recent turn of events, Pepe Coin (PEPE) has surged to a new all-time high, marking a significant moment in the ongoing meme coin mania that’s back to shake the crypto world.
The price of PEPE now sits at $0.00001031, showing a dramatic 91% increase over the last month and an astonishing 466% rise over the past year.
PEPE’s price ascended to $0.00001128, according to the latest data from CoinMarketCap, amid a broader meme trading frenzy paralleled by a surge in stocks like GameStop (NYSE: GME), which almost doubled in price recently. 


This rally appears closely tied to the activity of legendary meme-stock trader Roaring Kitty, known for his role in the GameStop short squeeze of 2021. 
Although he is not directly involved with PEPE, his return to social platforms has reinvigorated the meme asset market, significantly influencing PEPE’s trading volume and price.
In just 24 hours, PEPE’s trading volume exploded by 300% to $2.6 billion, making it the 7th most traded crypto asset and surpassing even Dogecoin (DOGE) in terms of trading volume. The open interest in PEPE perpetual futures also saw a 25% increase, reaching $118 million.
Technical analysis and future outlook
Technical indicators for PEPE are strongly bullish, with its 30-day average price outpacing its 200-day average and its Relative Strength Index (RSI) recently peaking above 80. Although it has seen a slight decline, the market’s momentum appears robust, supported by rising support and  resistance levels.

Whale activity has been particularly notable, with significant purchases indicating strong confidence in PEPE’s potential for further gains.

This optimism is tempered by a cautionary note for investors, where the recent peak could lead to a minor correction. Despite a 4% drop in the past day, market sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish, suggesting that after a brief dip, PEPE could climb.
Pepe price prediction
Currently, PEPE holds a market cap of $4.3 billion, ranking it as the 23rd largest cryptocurrency by market cap.
PEPPE 1 month prediction. Source: CoinCodex
According to recent data from CoinCodex, Pepe Coin is projected to experience a significant surge in value. Experts predict a 235.49% increase in the cryptocurrency’s price, potentially reaching $0.00003646 by June 13, 2024.
Current market analysis reveals a bullish sentiment, further supported by a Fear & Greed Index score of 66, indicating prevailing market greed.
Even though the current trends show strong market interest, it remains crucial for investors to stay informed and consider diverse perspectives before making investment decisions.

GameStop Tribute Meme Coin on Solana Surges to All-Time High Price - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe meme stock buzz only grew overnight, with GameStop (GME) shares opening the day at more than double Monday’s closing price, following the apparent return of prominent GME trader Roaring Kitty on Sunday. And the GameStop-themed tribute coin on Solana is similarly still reaping the rewards of the growing hype.The unofficial GME, which was launched on Solana back in January, spiked to an all-time high price of $0.01915 early Tuesday, beating the previous record of $0.0135 set back in February.It’s down since then to a current price of $0.013 per data from CoinGecko, but is still up 25% over the last 24 hours. The GME token currently has a market cap of about $89 million, with about $141 million worth of trading volume over the past day.The unofficial GameStop token—which has no known affiliation to the retailer—saw a massive spike in price from late Sunday into early Monday, rising 1,900% over a 24-hour period.The GME meme coin on Solana had been trading for about $0.0005 prior to Sunday’s sudden spike, down sharply from the short-lived buzz seen in late January and early February. With the latest gains, the GME token is now up 2,221% over the past seven days.Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty and "DeepFuckingValue" on Reddit, is a prominent stock trader who gained notoriety in early 2021 as one of the key forces behind the rise of GameStop’s share price, thanks to his enthusiastic posts and livestreams in support of the nostalgic gaming retailer. GME shares had lost substantial value as the legacy retailer struggled to adapt to industry shifts.But Roaring Kitty’s support helped trigger a wave of interest in GME and other “meme stocks” such as movie theater chain AMC, prompting surging prices in January 2021—and causing chaos on Wall Street in the process. Gill even testified in front of Congress on the matter, but then disappeared from social media a few months later.That is, until Sunday. A single image posted by the Roaring Kitty account on Twitter (aka X) fueled excitement that he might resume his meme stock sermons, prompting huge swings in value for companies like GameStop and AMC. Roaring Kitty has continued to post movie and music video clip montages with rousing phrases, fueling even more enthusiasm.GameStop shares are up 166% over the last five days at a price of $42.85, while AMC’s five-day jump sits at 104% with a current price of $6.42.The broader meme stock and coin revival is also triggering a surge in copycat efforts, with numerous additional GameStop-themed meme coins deployed on Solana over the last couple days. None of the coins have made nearly as much of an impact as the already-established GME, with most of the coins showing a market cap of under $1 million at present.Pump.fun, a platform that lets users cheaply and easily launch new tokens on Solana, saw a record number of new tokens deployed on Monday with more than 19,200 launched during the day. Meme coins, which are typically inspired by internet memes or pop culture figures and companies, are famously volatile and can just as quickly collapse in value. The GME token saw sizable up-and-down swings back in January and February before losing momentum—and there’s no guarantee that this latest swing will continue.DisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Coinbase Outage Stirs Intrigue: A Bull in Sheep's Clothing? - DailyCoin


        

Coinbase experienced a major outage, which caused a temporary shutdown of its services.



The exchange has assured users that assets remain safe.



Coinbase has announced the resumption of services across its platforms.




Coinbase, America’s largest crypto exchange, has been frequently thrust into the spotlight this year, marked by recurring service disruptions amid heightened market activity. With not one but two instances of user balance inconsistencies and withdrawal troubles, doubts about the exchanges have loomed large.



When the dust seemed to settle on its outage woes, Coinbase suffered another outage, again begging the question, why?



Why Is Coinbase Down?



In the early hours of Tuesday, May 14, 2024, Coinbase suffered a critical system-wide outage, rendering all its services inaccessible to users. The outage, which commenced around 4:00 UTC, disabled the exchange’s website and mobile platforms for nearly four hours, with users encountering a “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” error message. 




The unexpected nature and severity of the outage raised concerns among users, which the exchange addressed by announcing that an investigation was underway to determine the root cause of the disruption.



Despite the frustration, some users view the Coinbase outage as a positive sign for the crypto market. X user Gordy Clayton suggested that the unexpected shutdown indicates a bullish signal for the industry, stating, “you know we are back.”







Clayton’s comments received widespread agreement from his followers, many of whom echoed his sentiment. But why is this so?



Coinbase Outage: A Bullish Signal?



Bull runs in the crypto market are often associated with service disruptions and sometimes crashes across exchange and trading platforms. This correlation stems from increased trading activity, heightened withdrawals, and price surges that can overwhelm exchange systems.




On February 28, Coinbase experienced a similar service crash earlier this year, citing an enormous surge in traffic and heightened activity. This crash coincided with the February-March crypto rally, which saw Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets surge to new price highs.



While a surge in market activity does tick the boxes of bull run characteristics, there is no guarantee that the Coinbase outage was either “planned” or triggered by a surge in activity, making it challenging to chart a positive outlook.



On the Flipside




Despite Coinbase’s assurance that systems are fully recovered, several users still face withdrawal troubles.



Some users speculate that a Bitcoin whale sell-off triggered the Coinbase crash.



In March 2024, users reported withdrawal troubles and inefficient support service on Coinbase. 




Why This Matters



The frequency of outages on Coinbase undermines its credibility as a trading and exchange platform, and continued disruptions could severely damage its reputation, particularly given its size and the number of users it caters to.

Wisconsin buys Bitcoin, the first state to do so

Wisconsin has officially become the first state  to buy Bitcoin, according to a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. And while $98 million isn’t considered a lot of money for a state pension fund, it’s still a notable move given how notoriously volatile cryptocurrency investing can be.Own GameStop or AMC stock? Sell now, says strategistThe SEC filing, available online, was first reported by Coindesk, which notes the State of Wisconsin Investment Board bought 94,562 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) worth about $98 million and $63 million of Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF (GBTC). Bitcoin ETFs were only approved by the SEC this past January and allow institutional investors to invest in Bitcoin without actually holding the crypto directly. Crypto boosters were excited by the news on Tuesday, with many suggesting this could be just the start of other state pension funds investing in crypto.“Normally you don’t get these big fish institutions in the 13Fs for a year or so (when the ETF gets more liquidity) but as we’ve seen these are no ordinary launches,” Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg tweeted. “Good sign, expect more, as institutions tend to move in herds.”The most famous large institutional investment in Bitcoin started in El Salvador in 2021 when President Nayib Bukele purchased the crypto for his country and declared the cryptocurrency to be legal tender. El Salvador currently holds about 5,748 BTC, according to Coin Telegraph, worth roughly $360 million. But Bitcoin is an incredibly volatile asset. Those same holdings would have been worth about $155 million a year ago and there’s no guarantee Bitcoin’s price will continue to climb steadily.Bitcoin is currently trading at $61,774, down roughly 2% over the past 24 hours, though the crypto is up about 128% over the past year, recovering significantly since the market went into a tailspin following the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering.The State of Wisconsin Investment Board didn’t immediately respond to questions emailed Tuesday morning. We’ll update this post if we hear back.A version of this article originally appeared on Gizmodo.

How Will AI Make Payments for Us? The Answer Is Stablecoins - DailyCoin


        

ChatGPT-4o demos left audiences impressed. 



The question of how AI interacts with money has become more pressing.



Anthony Pompliano predicts AI bots would favor price-stable cryptocurrencies for payment.




The unveiling of OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o on May 13 demonstrated a major leap in how humans interact with AI. One awe-inspiring demo showed the advanced language model patiently teaching a young student basic trigonometry concepts, showcasing its ability to engage in intelligent dialogue and high-level knowledge transfer. As AI’s capabilities advance rapidly, big questions loom over its societal impact.



Goldman Sachs expects two-thirds of US jobs to be affected by AI automation to some degree, and McKinsey predicts 12 million Americans may lose their jobs to AI by 2030. With the technology’s seemingly unstoppable rise and inevitable creep into our daily lives, questions arise as to how it will interact with money, with some believing cryptocurrency provides the ideal solution. 



Barriers to AI Using Banks 



With AI’s rapid advancement and its inevitable integration into our daily lives, it has become increasingly urgent to explore how these systems can effectively interface with money and payments. This urgency is heightened by the banking system operating under strict rules not designed for use by non-human entities.




Banks and financial institutions enforce strict know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements that necessitate human identity verification. An AI system lacks the legal personhood or documented identification to open an account. Furthermore, giving AI access to your banking would open up issues regarding sharing access, particularly in cases of fraud or incorrect purchases.



These barriers and uncertainties under the banking system underscore the need for alternative digital payment rails better suited to AI’s status as a program, leading some to believe the solution lies in cryptocurrencies. 



Stablecoins Over Bitcoin



Wading into the discussion, investor Anthony Pompliano envisions AI bots leveraging traditional banking infrastructure to conduct financial tasks on our behalf. However, autonomous bot-to-bot payments would be tricky if there was no access to banking.




This is where Pompliano sees cryptocurrency, specifically stablecoins rather than Bitcoin, filling the void. He stated, “If a bot wants to send or receive money with another bot, then using these digital wallets will empower them to do so,” as digital crypto wallets can be generated without KYC hurdles, allowing AI bots to exchange value directly.



While Bitcoin is the biggest, most well-known cryptocurrency, making it a seemingly logical choice for AI payment systems, Pompliano argued that stablecoins’ price stability gives them an advantage over notoriously volatile Bitcoin when it comes to providing a medium of exchange.



Even so, Pompliano acknowledged AI’s crypto convergence still raises numerous unanswered questions around regulation, tax implications, and legal frameworks to govern disputes between AI bots and their owners.



On the Flipside




AI payment preferences could impact the adoption and market dynamics of favored cryptocurrencies.



A system with goods and services priced in fiat will inherently favor stablecoins over BTC for payments.



Pompliano assumed AI bots would automatically transact with one another within human-constructed money systems.




Why This Matters



AI’s potential embrace of stablecoins could provide a tailwind for their market capitalization and hasten the end of Bitcoin’s medium of exchange narrative.

Galaxy Digital’s revenue soars with mining, fees at record levels

Galaxy Digital reported a robust first quarter in 2024, with net income climbing to $422 million, a 40% increase from the previous quarter. The surge was supported by record earnings in mining and management fees.According to the company, its mining operations generated a record-breaking $31.5 million in revenue, representing a 69% rise from the previous quarter. The growth was primarily driven by its expansion of mining capacity, with its hash rate under management (HUM) reaching 5.7 exahash per second (EH/s). During the quarter, Galaxy mined 373 Bitcoin (BTC) at an average cost of less than $19,500. Asset management was also a strong performer for the company in the first quarter. Management and performance fees reached a record $17.8 million — a 113% increase from the previous quarter. Galaxy's hash rate under management. Source: Galaxy DigitalIn January, Galaxy Digital and Invesco launched a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. In April, the company expanded its offerings of BTC and Ether (ETH) in the European market by launching two exchange-traded commodities (ETCs) in partnership with DWS Group.Trading operations reported revenue of $66 million, marking a 78% increase primarily fueled by gains from derivatives and positive movements in asset prices. Galaxy reported that the average size of its loan book grew to $664 million. Galaxy’s assets under management surged to approximately $7.8 billion as of March 31, 2024, marking a 219% increase year-over-year and 50% jump from the previous quarter. Its equity capital also saw significant growth, rising to $2.2 billion, up 22% quarter-over-quarter. Assets under stake grew by 100% in the first quarter, reaching $1.5 billion as Galaxy moves to become the second largest validator on the Solana network.In April, the company raised approximately $125 million in financing. Galaxy plans to use the capital to enhance the infrastructure of its Helios mining facility located in West Texas. The current infrastructure at Helios can support 180 megawatts, while Galaxy was granted approval to scale up to 800 megawatts at the site.

Tether's Latest Crackdown: $5.2 Million Frozen To Stop Phishing Scandals In Their Tracks


								To combat illicit financial activities, Tether, the entity behind the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has frozen approximately 5.2 million USDT.
The crypto tracking and compliance platform MistTrack detailed this action, which targeted 12 Ethereum addresses identified as part of phishing operations.

Details Of The Freeze
The affected addresses used in the phishing were notably tagged as “USDT Banned Address,” indicating their involvement in potential money laundering activities commonly associated with phishing groups.
Phishing groups often transfer their ill-gotten gains to secondary platforms and utilize cryptocurrency mixers to obscure the origins of their funds.

Tether’s recent freeze is part of a broader strategy to undermine these illicit activities by cutting off access to crucial financial resources.
This freeze is not an isolated incident. Late last year, Tether collaborated with crypto asset trading platform OKX to implement the most extensive freeze of USDT. This action involved freezing over 225 million USDT across 37 wallets, which were connected to a human trafficking network.
This action underscored Tether’s “current dedication” to using its technological capabilities to support global law enforcement in addressing and mitigating criminal activities.
Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s newly appointed CEO, reinforced this commitment, stating, “Tether remains steadfast in its support of law enforcement efforts and in aiding victims in their recovery.”
He emphasized the company’s zero tolerance for the misuse of USDT or any cryptocurrency for illicit purposes, underscoring their “dedication” to working alongside global law enforcement to ensure the integrity of the digital asset ecosystem.
The Larger Picture: Tether’s Role In Combating Illicit Crypto Flows
Despite these efforts, Tether’s ubiquity within the cryptocurrency market has made it a frequent tool in illicit transactions. A report by blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs highlighted that the USDT issuer accounted for $19.3 billion of illegal transaction volume in 2023, a decrease from $24.7 billion the previous year.
TRM’s analysis pointed out that USDT on the Tron blockchain, which hosts a significant portion of the total volume of stablecoin issuers, is the preferred currency for terrorist financing entities.
This blockchain saw a 125% increase in terror-financing-related addresses receiving USDT, indicating the challenges and complexities in curtailing these flows.
Meanwhile, the global regulatory environment continues to scrutinize Tether’s operations. A report by the Financial Times highlighted the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s identification of Tether as a tool increasingly used by money launderers and fraudsters in Southeast Asia.

In response, Ardoino criticized the report, suggesting that it was written with little understanding of the facts and was biased towards traditional finance, which he believes is struggling to adapt to the successes of new technologies.

Aave Announces Lens Network L2 Leveraging ZK Stack - The Defiant

Lens Network will host a new deployment of Lens Protocol.Lens Lab, the team behind Aave’s decentralized social media protocol, Lens, is launching a Layer 2 network designed to support web3 social applications.Announced on May 14, Lens Network leverages Matter Labs’ modular ZK Stack infrastructure, with Lens planning to build a hybrid validium and volition Layer 2. Lens said this design can support the high transaction throughput required by mainstream consumer applications while maintaining cheap fees. Lens Network will also leverage account abstraction to provide gasless and signless transactions to streamline user onboarding.“Lens Network overcomes the scaling limitations of blockchain and can support mass adoption,” said Matter Labs, the team behind ZkSync. “This breakthrough in scalability delivers a user experience on par with traditional social networks while maintaining the benefits of web3: user ownership, portability, choice, and secure transactions.”“Lens Network creates a hybrid architecture that combines validium and volition with the ZK Stack on Ethereum,” said Stani Kulechov, founder of Avara — the parent company of Lens and Aave. “This not only scales but will make the internet more open and fair.”Lens celebrated its permissionless launch in late February, allowing anybody to create a profile or develop applications on top of the protocol.Daily activity jumped up from less than 10,000 transactions per day to around 40,000 following its permissionless launch, while Lens’ active user count has steadily trended between 800 and 1,500 since November, according to Dune Analytics.Lens Network rolloutThe Lens Network will also host a new version of the Lens Protocol intended to serve as a central hub for Lens users. The new protocol will facilitate integrations with both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and non-EVM compatible blockchains, allowing developers to build Lens-based social applications across multiple networks.Avara will deploy Lens Network’s permissionless rollout over three phases, beginning with the launch of a validium using ZK compression techniques to ensure data accessibility. Validiums differ from rollups, the most prevalent Layer 2 scaling mechanism, by publishing data off-chain to reduce transaction costs and bolster throughput.Later launch phases will introduce multiple synchronous validium chains enabling social use cases involving both public and private interactions to protect users’ privacy, followed by adopting volition to combine both a zero-knowledge rollup and validium architecture for Lens Network.“Users will be able to decide what they wish to share, and how they interact with applications,” Matter Labs said.Lens’ previous deployment on Momoka, a Polygon-based Layer 3, will continue to operate. Applications will be able to migrate over to Lens Network as Lens plans to deprecate Momoka.Using web3 to decentralize social capitalLens argued that web2 social media platforms “trap” their users within walled gardens under the control of corporate giants. Users are unable to transfer their social capital between networks, creating siloed platforms facilitating the capture users’ data for profit.Avara argues that on-chain networks enable social media to take a form that benefits users by making it hard for a single entity to monopolistically control network and user data.“This empowers users with ownership of their social media identity and connections,” Lens said. “With on-chain social networks, users can freely move their data and connections across social media applications.”

Lens Network to migrate to zkSync - Blockworks


On-chain social network infrastructure Lens is getting a new home.
The new Lens Network will build upon the work of the original Lens Protocol as one of zkSync’s ZK Stack hyperchains.
Lens Lab develops the protocol under the umbrella of Avara, which also built DeFi giant Aave.
But Avara CEO Stani Kulechov told Blockworks that the non-financial use cases of crypto — citing identity and online social interactions — have the potential to be even bigger.
“The way I think about finance and social [spaces] is that there are a lot of people who have financial capital, but everyone on the planet has social capital — the content we create, the relationships we create and the identities we interact with,” Kulechov said.

The ZK Stack chain will serve as a “central hub” for Lens, which, according to a blog post released Tuesday, will “seamlessly integrate with other EVM and non-EVM blockchains.”
A testnet release of the new network is still months away. The current version of Lens has been operational on Polygon’s PoS chain since May 2022.
The modular, open-source ZK Stack framework, based on the zkSync Era code, will provide Lens with horizontal scaling, connecting as many Lens chains as needed by zk bridges, according to Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski.
“You can add one billion users and you will not lose any of the properties of verifiability,” Gluchowski told Blockworks. “Every single transaction of those millions and billions of users will be verified by every single Ethereum validator — which is the magic of zk,” he said.
Lens pioneered on-chain social infrastructure, but was initially conceived and developed at a time when zk rollup technology was still seen as years away from production at scale.

“We want to build something that enables open and fair social spaces that anyone can participate on a network level, and because of the ownership aspect that also means you can own your social capital,” Kulechov explained.
That’s not possible with today’s social networks. User-created content is owned by the platforms, giving users limited ways to monetize without locking them in or relying on advertisers.
“We see Lens as the forebearer of Ethereum values when it comes to social,” Gluchowski said. “Lens is the only network that is actually making users the owners of their identities and their content. Everything is happening on-chain.”

That’s in contrast to Farcaster, where posts and interactions are primarily off-chain, as are user profiles, although they are linked to an on-chain Ethereum address.
Mainstream Web2 social options like Facebook are centralized and silo user-generated content.
“Our mission is to change the relationship to be more fair [and] give more ownership and power to the users. Hopefully that user choice creates more open social spaces where users can choose algorithms and experiences as well, and there’s more competition on the application level,” Kulechov said.
The parties did not disclose any financial terms related to the move, or a strategy to incentivize users to migrate to the new version.
“We haven’t had any thoughts on migration incentives,” Kulechov said, adding: “I think people will organically migrate from the existing structure into the Lens Net fork down the line.”
But Kulechov noted that the phased approach to the rollout would include inviting users to migrate during a testnet phase and then be upgraded into the mainnet when ready.

Bitcoin’s Future Is ‘Bleak’ and Ripe for Regulation, Core Developer Says - Decrypt

One of the most prolific contributors to Bitcoin development warns that the leading blockchain network is on a dark path toward global regulation.In a blog post on Saturday, Matt Corallo said Bitcoin’s long-assumed mission to be a private, scalable, and trustless monetary tool is now being called into question, with years of effort failing to implement that vision in any practical sense.“Sadly, all the ideas for making Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) actually useful for transacting trend towards having some untrusted party in the flow of funds,” wrote Corallo. “We just haven’t cracked building cryptocurrency payment rails without an (untrusted!) party being involved.”The end result will be regulatory capture, he predicts, a world where government authorities succeed in restricting or controlling crypto toward their own ends.“I’m not saying these things aren’t great or don’t provide scalability, they often are and do,” Corallo told Decrypt, “but that they rely on intermediaries, often of the centralized variety.”Bitcoin scaling technologies in use today—such as sidechains like Liquid or Rootstock—do enabling faster and cheaper payments, but also require users to trust a company or federation to not steal their funds. Meanwhile, Corallo adds, the more popular Lightning network has a notoriously poor user experience, requiring custodians and Lightning service providers (LSPs) to build front ends for practical use.Corallo’s criticism also extends to rollups, a newer form of Bitcoin scaling tech that takes inspiration from other blockchains. In fact, the developer believes trustless scaling remains elusive to cryptocurrencies at large, since even more programmable blockchains like Ethereum have failed to crack the code.“The point of highlighting that this is cryptocurrency-wide and not Bitcoin-specific is that this isn’t solvable with some kind of soft fork to increase expressivity,” Corallo told Decrypt. “This isn’t passing judgment on if we should or should not do any specific soft fork to increase expressiveness, but pointing out this is largely an unrelated problem.”Roadblocks in these areas have contributed to a visible change in how Bitcoin is perceived by its users. Many new participants, Corallo wrote, are “only interested in a 21M coins limit and seeing any form of non-KYC payment rails as hostile to the value of their investment.”Over the past year, some of Bitcoin’s most avid institutional supporters have outright dismissed the asset’s role as a medium of exchange.Paypal co-founder and Lightspark CEO David Marcus said in September that BTC “is not the currency that people will use to buy things," asserting that fiat currencies on the Lightning network will be the preferred payment rail of the masses.Earlier this year, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor extolled Bitcoin’s role as a store of value while calling its role as currency “a distraction” that is “controversial” with regulators.Indeed, the U.S. government recently arrested the developers of Samourai Wallet, a Bitcoin wallet designed to facilitate private transfers through CoinJoin transactions.Samourai’s software never took control of user funds, though it did require a centralized server to coordinate transaction mixing, giving it a single point of failure for regulators to target.The clampdown prompted a “final warning” from famous U.S. government whistleblower Edward Snowden, who pushed developers to implement a Bitcoin protocol-level privacy change.According to Corallo, the crypto industry has already squandered its chance to ensure regulatory protection for non-custodial crypto intermediaries, instead focusing its efforts on securities law reform.What’s worse, the present state of mining pool centralization has left even Bitcoin’s foundational layer “ripe for regulatory capture.”“With where Bitcoin is today, it's hard not to see a bleak vision of the future,” the developer concluded. “If Bitcoiners want to preserve what we’ve built and fight for it, the focus needs to be on drastic improvements to default wallet privacy across the ecosystem, aggressive investment in regulatory change, and operation of scalability solutions across the world.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Uniswap Creator Hayden Adams Issues Warning to Democrats, Says Republicans ‘Smell Blood’ and Turning to Crypto - The Daily Hodl


								Uniswap Labs chief executive Hayden Adams is warning Democrats that their anti-crypto agenda could cost them dearly in the November 2024 US presidential election.
Adams, who invented the decentralized crypto exchange (DEX) Uniswap (UNI), tells his 286,100 followers on the social media platform X that Democrats are making a political miscalculation when it comes to digital assets.










He compares US Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) attacks on crypto to a political misstep by the unsuccessful Democratic 2016 US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
“Hillary [Clinton] campaigning in red states instead of swing states level miscalculation from [US President Joe] Biden camp thinking crypto will be irrelevant in 2024 election and letting SEC plus Warren wage total war – both in terms of voters and money. 
Republicans smell blood in the water and are turning hard towards crypto. Not much time for Biden to save it. Anyone close to him or Democratic leadership should be expressing how serious this is and pushing for immediate reversal on his approach to crypto (public support/plan and reigning in SEC and Warren)… 
[Biden] can understand someone he trusts telling him ‘You will lose if you don’t do X.'” 
The Chamber of Digital Commerce recently accused Warren of “trying to kill” the entire crypto industry through her proposed Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act.
The stakes are high as Biden faces off against Republican nominee Donald Trump in the November 2024 presidential election. Trump recently said he is “fine with” crypto and accused Biden and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler of being against digital assets.

Pre-token markets can revolutionize interactions with financial instruments: Keyrock report - Crypto Briefing




Pre-token trading platforms are still an unpredictable market for buyers and sellers, according to a recent Keyrock report. Despite offering early access to tokens before they launch, data gathered by Keyrock suggests few buyers find profits in these platforms.Nevertheless, the speculation around the token price serves as a crucial barometer for initial market reactions and investor mood. In cases such as JUP and W, the price after the token generation event (TGE) showed substantial convergence with the pre-market prices.However, not all tokens behave like JUP and W, as some display significant price variances, the report shows. Notably, Whales Market often commands a premium over AEVO or Hyperliquid.Moreover, pre-token markets diverge in trading activity, which may lead to inconsistent price prediction.“Trading a token before its official launch is a pioneering idea. Yet, if pre-token markets occasionally struggle to agree on the correct price, can they truly forecast post-TGE prices accurately? This raises critical questions: can these markets be trusted, and are they genuinely efficient?,” the report highlights.To track the post-TGE activity, Keyrock created index prices that uses market caps as weights to determine an average. In essence, the pre-TGE index price should converge post-TGE. They analyzed trading activity on AEVO, Hyperliquid, and Whales Market for ALT, DYM, ENA, JUP, Pixels, Portal, STRK, TNSR, and W.Pre-TGE and post-TGE index charted. Image: KeyrockKeyrock analysts explain that the navy blue line displayed in the image above tracks the index price post-TGE, acting as a benchmark. and it should align with the pre-token market index price over time.Although AEVO and Hyperliquid indexes converge close to the TGE, the Whales Market line shows a dramatic spike just days before TGE, likely fuelled by a palpable wave of “fear of missing out.”“These observations offer more than mere data points; they provide profound insights into the emotional and psychological dynamics that drive market behavior pre-TGE. Understanding these is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile waters of pre-token launches.”The report then finds out that the market landscape does not favor a consistent set of winners, as both buyers and sellers can realize significant gains depending on their timing.Another common characteristic of pre-token markets is the points system, which consists of users selling their points used to qualify for airdrops. The report finds a lack of correlation between price movements and these points in pre-markets.“Blast and Parcl, for instance, exhibit unique trading patterns in their token prices that do not mirror their points markets. This disconnection underscores a broader issue: the glaring lack of liquidity that obstructs genuine price discovery, resulting in volatilities that are 10-20 times higher in pre-token markets than those seen post-TGE.”Yet, even with the flaws identified by Keyrock, they still see this as a “development that isn’t merely captivating for the industry,” with the potential to reshape the wider financial landscape. The possibility of trading assets before they truly materialize can revolutionize the way investors interact with financial instruments, concludes the report.

Crypto Exchange poloniex's $100 Million Hack Traced to Tornado Cash

$53.5M Million worth of Ether (ETH) related to the November 2023 Poloniex hack has been located at Tornado Cash, a decentralized cryptocurrency tumbler. This phenomenon, shown by PeckShieldAlert, casts a new light on the consequences of one of the most serious cryptocurrency security breaches.Poloniex hack traced to Tornado Cash The Poloniex cryptocurrency exchange suffered an attack on November 10, 2023; thus, the losses were greater than $100 million worth of Ether. Though Poloniex tried to get the stolen funds back, including offering a $10 million reward, the effort was unsuccessful because the hacker was not found. The firm, which is a blockchain security firm, blamed the hack on a “private key compromise.After the breach, Poloniex put the affected wallets on hold and started investigating them. Nevertheless, the hacker’s goal to return the funds was not material, consequently leaving Poloniex and its users in deep trouble.Through intense investigations, PeckShield discovered that a major segment of the stolen money, around $53, was actually transferred back to Tornado Cash. The millions had been laundered through Tornado Cash. The hacker moved about 17,800 ETH from different wallets to one Tornado Cash address, making tracing and withdrawing the funds more difficult.Poloniex security measures and compensation pledgeAlthough the crypto-exchange was shut down, Poloniex continued its operations, allowing investors to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies. The exchange was also ready to take the risk of enhancing security by hiring a leading auditing firm to conduct a detailed audit. After finishing the audit, the exchange promised to resume deposit and withdrawal services immediately.Justin Sun, the CEO and founder of Poloniex, TRON, assured the users affected by the issue that they would be compensated fully and that Poloniex has a very strong financial condition. Sun also stated that he intends to work with other exchanges to get back the funds that were stolen due to the security breach, showing his dedication to dealing with the aftermath of the hacking.

OKX Expands Global Presence with New Australian Exchange - DailyCoin


        

OKX has unveiled Australia as the latest region it will offer its services.



The exchange will offer diverse services to a range of users.



OKX recently exited the Indian and Nigerian crypto markets amid regulatory uncertainties.




The present year has seen significant expansion for various crypto exchanges, marked by global market growth and new market entries. Despite tightening regulatory pressure across major regions, several crypto service providers have continued to broaden their reach.



Now joining the ranks is crypto exchange OKX, which has added yet another county to its list.   



OKX Enters Australia



In a blog post on Tuesday, May 14, OKX announced its entry into the Australian market by launching a spot and derivatives crypto trading platform to serve investors within the region. 




The entry, which follows its acquisition of the Australia Financial Services (AFS) license, will allow local investors to access Australian Dollar (AUD) deposit and withdrawal options. This will provide access to 85 crypto asset options, including stablecoins, and over 170 crypto spot pairs.







Users can access services, including peer-to-peer trading and affiliated platforms such as MoonPay, Simplex, and Banxa. Additionally, all Australian users will gain access to OKX’s spot trading options, while only select verified institutional clients will have access to its derivatives trading. 



OKX’s Australia venture marks a win for the exchange, particularly following the regulatory uncertainty it has faced in other regions.



OKX Taps Out of Crypto Markets 



In March 2024, the exchange announced its exit from the Indian market, citing mounting local regulatory hurdles as the key reason behind the decision. 




OKX mandated Indian users to close their accounts and redeem funds, setting an April 30 deadline for the complete shutdown of its services within the region. The exchange’s decision was fueled by its inability to reach an agreement with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which commenced a regulatory crackdown earlier in the year.



India was not the only region the exchange withdrew from. On May 3, OKX dropped support for Nigeria’s local currency, the Naira. This move came amid the country’s broader tussle with crypto service providers, imposing sanctions and restrictions on their services.



Citing “a change in local market requirements,” the exchange emphasized that the Naira peer-to-peer option will no longer be available, and its official website remains inaccessible to local investors.

Market Preps for ETF Bummer | Bankless


Bracing for denial? ETH’s relative value to BTC has been walloped throughout the month of May. Why can’t Ether catch a bid, and what impact could the looming spot ETH ETF final decision next week have on your bags?The likelihood of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot ETH ETF by the end of May has doubled from last week, rising from 7% to 14%, but this probability has steadily declined throughout 2024 and remains at dismal levels compared to the peak of 76% seen at the beginning of the year.Prediction market speculators were emboldened by news last Friday that Ark Invest had removed staking from its spot ETH ETF application, seemingly suggesting that approval of non-staking applications is imminent, yet participants in more liquid spot markets appear to be operating on the assumption that this announcement was a nothing burger.While the prediction market-implied odds of approval have ticked up slightly, the ETH/BTC ratio fell an additional 2% this weekend, compounding on losses accrued throughout May; it currently rests beneath the key 0.05 level and is pressed into 2024 lows.Source: TradingViewAccording to a Fortune report from March, the SEC began subpoenaing crypto companies for information about their dealings with the Ethereum Foundation shortly after the network’s transition to proof-of-stake in September 2022 with the hopes of classifying the asset as a security.Yesterday, Van Buren Capital's Scott Johnsson highlighted that documents released by the SEC note the agency “is providing notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration.”While this provision was included in every spot ETH ETF request for comment, it was notably absent from all spot BTC ETF filings, suggesting that the SEC may deny spot ETH ETFs on the grounds that they are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares as they actually hold securities, a point potentially proven by information received from subpoenas.
Despite the SEC's apparent efforts to classify Ether as a security, it's important to note that the regulator approved ETH commodity futures-based ETFs last October.This decision came after Ethereum’s transition to PoS, indicating that the SEC has already ceded jurisdiction of the asset and solidified its status as a commodity, as the instruments would be illegal (and therefore not trading) if the underlying asset was a security.Market participants are overwhelmingly anticipating denial for spot ETH ETFs come the SEC’s first final decision deadline for VanEck's application on May 23; however, given the agency’s prior approval of commodity futures ETFs, it is difficult to see how the SEC could justify not listing these products in the absence of new information generated from their subpoenas.

BREAKING: Coinbase Adds a New Altcoin to Its Roadmap to List - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to the latest development, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has added the Drift Protocol (DRIFT) altcoin to its roadmap to list it.
According to the official statement made by Coinbase, DRIFT will be supported on the Solana network if listed.


Coinbase's roadmap also currently includes the QCAD (QCAD) altcoin on the Ethereum network.
Although adding an asset to this roadmap is not a guarantee of listing, so far being added to Coinbase's list has always resulted in being listed on the exchange.





The DRIFT token is currently unlisted and will launch with an airdrop on May 16 at 15:00 Turkish time. Therefore, those who claim to sell DRIFT tokens these days are likely to be fraudsters and users should be careful.
According to its tokenomics, DRIFT will initially distribute 10% of its total supply as an airdrop.

                        Crypto markets were in a sea of red on Tuesday in the wake of US PPI inflation data and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with investors struggling to pick which crypto to buy now.The only top 100 crypto in the green in the past 24 hours is Pepe, which just hit record highs.Iconic GameStop investor Roaring Kitty, a key figure in the 2021 meme stock craze, returned to social media on Monday.And his return triggered a spike in speculative trading activity, with the likes of GME, AMC and meme coins pumping.Aside from Pepe, that pump has now reversed for most meme coins.Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) were last down 3-5% in 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.Bitcoin (BTC), meanwhile, was last down around 2% in the mid-$61,000s.Spikes in meme coin risk appetite are often viewed as a short-term bearish sign for the broader market.Incoming Spike in Inflation Expectations
Macro strategist Otavio Costa pointed out that the latest spike in GameStop could indicate an impending spike in inflation expectations.A spike in inflation expectations would presumably force the Fed to raise interest rates, as happened in 2021/2022.That said, Fed’s Powell reiterated on Tuesday that he doesn’t expect the Fed’s next move to be a rate hike.He added that he expected inflation to move lower again but isn’t as confident about inflation as before.His remarks come after the release of hotter-than-expected PPI data and one day ahead of the release of CPI data.Powell’s remarks and the latest PPI data appear to have weighed on sentiment in the broader market.Bitcoin is still trading well within recent ranges, while Ether (ETH) is threatening a break below $2,850 support.With so many cryptos in the red, investors might be struggling to find the best crypto to buy today. Here are a few candidates that analysts at Cryptonews are big fans of.Best Crypto to Buy TodaySlothana (SLOTH)A new Solana meme coin, Slothana (SLOTH), has witnessed a major surge in price since its launch earlier this month.

The Crypto Industry’s Influence on U.S. Elections is Bigger Than Ever, Industry Insiders Say

"It’s a much more sophisticated operation," Smith said. "I feel like I used to walk around Washington, and people would say ‘Oh, there’s Kristin, she works for that little blockchain industry thing.’ Now it’s like, ‘Oh wow, that’s the powerful crypto industry and they’re here to influence Washington and are pulling out all the tools to do it."

There is a New Development in the $9.2 Billion Mt. Gox Earthquake in Bitcoin - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to recent updates shared on Reddit, Mt. Gox is preparing to distribute its assets of 142,000 Bitcoin (BTC), 143,000 Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and 69 billion yen to its creditors.
In the latest development, MtGox's Kraken BTC and Bitcoin Cash payment API interfaces have been updated to say “payment is now being prepared.” The update in question was made yesterday.


Distribution is expected to occur before October 31, 2024.
The Tokyo-based exchange, which was hacked in 2011 and declared bankruptcy in 2014, has been under the spotlight since US prosecutors last year accused two Russian citizens of making secret plans to hack into the exchange's servers.






According to Arkham Intelligence, the bankrupt platform currently holds 137,892 BTC worth approximately $9.2 billion. Previous documents had revealed that Mt Gox also held Bitcoin Cash and fiat, some of which were returned to creditors.
The trustee overseeing the liquidation process stated that creditors should expect to receive basic, interim and early lump sum payments by October 31. However, a key question remains: will creditors sell their crypto, putting potential pressure on Bitcoin's market value?

Storm Trade Leverages TON Blockchain and Telegram Integration to Attract Millions of DeFi Users



                    

Storm Trade, a decentralized derivatives trading platform built on the TON blockchain, is set to launch its native utility token, $STORM, in May or June of this year. The platform, which boasts direct integration with Telegram, aims to attract the next 10 million DeFi users by offering a user-friendly and highly accessible trading experience. 



With a leverage of up to x50, Storm Trade offers a diverse range of synthetic assets, including popular cryptocurrencies, FOREX, equity, and precious metals. The platform has witnessed a remarkable trading volume of $8,749,409 in the last 24 hours.




The $STORM token launch is highly anticipated, with only approximately 4% of the total supply of 1B being made available for sale. Holders of the platform’s Market Makers NFT, which currently has a floor price of around $1,600, will have the opportunity to purchase the token first at a fixed minimum price. 



The token offers significant utility, with staking and liquidity buffering. The total value locked (TVL) in the platform currently stands at $11,198,846.



A standout feature of Storm Trade is its direct integration with Telegram, making it the first perpetual decentralized exchange accessible within the popular messaging app. Users can trade a diverse range of assets including cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and commodities while receiving real-time updates, all without leaving Telegram. The platform prioritizes user safety through a non-custodial model and isolated margin trading to limit potential losses. Additionally, Storm Trade incorporates gamification elements like NFTs, avatars, and trading competitions to enhance the user experience.




Storm Trade has formed partnerships with notable organizations such as Gotbit, Cointelegraph, and ToncoinFund, further strengthening its position in the DeFi space. The project has also attracted significant interest from investors, with investment rounds being oversubscribed three times. 



The platform’s long-term vision includes becoming the most widely adopted decentralized leveraged trading platform, governed by the $STORM token and generating revenue for distribution through a staking pool.



The seamless integration with Telegram sets Storm Trade apart from traditional on-chain platforms, offering users real-time notifications, direct access to the Telegram wallet, and rewards for traders and liquidity providers. 



Token distribution:





IDO: 4,2%



Community & Ecosystem: 30%



Investors: 17,9%



Advisors: 5%



Liquidity: 10%



Team: 15%



Airdrop: 3,5%



Treasury: 14,4%




Storm Trade’s launch plan consists of four phases, with the public testnet and open beta phases already completed or in progress. The Market Makers NFT phase is currently underway, offering users the chance to acquire unique NFTs that grant whitelist access for the token launch. The final phase, the Token Generation Event (TGE), is estimated to take place in June 2024, with the token being launched on several leading launchpad platforms.



With its innovative approach to derivatives trading, strong partnerships, and a utility-focused token, Storm Trade is well-positioned to make a significant impact in the DeFi space. As the platform continues to grow and attract users, the upcoming $STORM token launch presents a unique opportunity for investors and traders alike.

State of Wisconsin reports $164M investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs

The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) reported investments in spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds offered by Grayscale and BlackRock.In a May 14 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the government entity responsible for managing Wisconsin state trust funds disclosed it held more than 2.4 million shares in the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and more than a million shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), worth roughly $100 million and $64 million, respectively. The filing suggested that the Wisconsin Retirement System could have exposure to crypto investments through the two asset management firms.The SWIB reported that it managed more than $156 billion in assets as of December 2023, with roughly 48% going into public equity investments. Other investments included shares of stock in Coinbase, MicroStrategy and Cleanspark. The SEC added that observers should not assume that the information provided by the state entity was “accurate and complete.”“Normally you don’t get these big fish institutions in the 13Fs for a year or so (when the ETF gets more liquidity) but as we’ve seen these are no ordinary launches,” said Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas in a May 14 X post. “Good sign, expect more, as institutions tend to move in herds.”Related: Bitcoin returns “too significant to ignore” for world’s retirement plansThe SEC filing followed similar reports from major banks, including Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, who disclosed less than $1 million combined in spot BTC ETFs. Susquehanna International Group reported it purchased more than $1 billion worth of shares of the spot crypto ETFs in the first quarter of 2024. The investments were comprised of shares of GBTC, IBIT, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.The SEC approved the listing and trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs on U.S. exchanges in January. Many experts expect the commission to decide whether to approve a spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund by May 23, when the final deadline for an application from asset manager VanEck approaches.Magazine: Get Bitcoin or die tryin’: Why hip hop stars love crypto

Ethereum Co-Founder Joe Lubin: US Crypto Hostility Goes Beyond Biden, Gensler - Decrypt

In recent months, anger at the U.S. government’s increasing hostility to crypto has—perhaps unsurprisingly—taken on a partisan flavor, with many industry leaders laying blame at the feet of individual Democrats, including President Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. But Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin sees things differently. To him, the root cause of crypto’s crisis in America may not be the fault of any individual political actor—or even one political party. “It might go beyond that,” Lubin said in an exclusive interview with Decrypt. “There may be some entity—related, perhaps, to the banking lobby—that is behind this.”Lubin believes that crypto and decentralization pose an existential threat to the global influence long enjoyed by the American state in cooperation with traditional finance. Thus, he figures, some nonpartisan element representing long-term American global interests may be behind the country’s accelerating crypto resistance. The idea has echoes of what some prominent people in the crypto industry describe as “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” popularized by Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter. The theory goes that there exists a coordinated effort at the federal level, and perhaps beyond, to make it very difficult for crypto companies to do business. The speculative agenda borrows its name from the very real “Operation Choke Point” the Department of Justice ran from 2013 to 2017 that sought to unlawfully cut off payday lenders and firearms dealers from banking services. Is the same thing happening now with crypto? Lubin says it may be bigger than even that.“It's pretty obvious that the United States likes to operate top-down, to control as much of the world as it can—through, especially, financial intermediaries,” Lubin said. “This technology doesn't make guarantees that the bank holding companies will maintain their edge long-term.”“So maybe it goes deeper,” he added.As Lubin sees it, a so-called “clash of civilizations” between decentralization advocates like himself and the entrenched American establishment has always been something of an inevitability. In that light, he said, the SEC’s current assault on the crypto industry isn’t much of a surprise or aberration. Last month, Consensys, the Ethereum software company founded by Lubin, filed a preemptive lawsuit against the SEC, challenging the regulator’s reported position that the buying and selling of ETH constitutes an illegal unregistered securities offering. Lubin has previously said that an SEC victory in the case would “spell the end of the Ethereum blockchain in the United States.” (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.)As far as Lubin’s theory about Wall Street’s secret hand in crypto’s current woes goes, there are a couple of caveats. For one, he says, it’s just speculation. And second, it’s not like traditional finance has been wholly opposed to blockchain innovation: Most major banks embraced spot Bitcoin ETFs, and still more are lining up to list spot Ethereum ETFs. But, Lubin says, profiting off crypto ETFs is a far cry from endorsing genuine decentralization. Wall Street firms could easily enrich themselves on Bitcoin ETFs while, at the same time, fighting to prevent companies like Consensys from building a decentralized future.“All of them can do well on this technology,” he said. “That doesn't mean they don't want to just perpetuate the system for as long as they can.”Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Threatens DOGE Flip: Who’s Got the Edge? - DailyCoin


        
Shiba Inu flipped AVAX, TRON, and DOT amid an impressive March 2024 rally.



Both canine coins are over 70% down from their all-time heights in 2021.



The distance between SHIB & DOGE market capitalization is over $8B.
Meme coins are at the center of attention as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have outperformed the largest digital assets since last week. As Shiba Inu embarked on a mini rally to restore support at $0.000024, DOGE inked 6.3% gains over the past 24 hours to trade above $0.15.Based on the global market cap, DOGE is the top dog at $21.82 billion, while SHIB has a market capitalization of $12.96 billion.These Key Metrics Are Paving the Way for SHIBWhen considering if Shiba Inu can overtake Dogecoin by global market cap, large holder netflow is valuable insight. By definition, a large holder is someone who has at least 0.1% of the circulating coin supply. While SHIB’s large holder netflow increased by 124% over the past seven days, the 574% upswing in a 90-day timeframe proves that SHIB capitalized on March’s meme coin rally in more ways than DOGE.
In contrast, DOGE’s large holder netflow has slumped by 42% over the past three months despite a hefty increase in long-term investors. The long-term holder metric is not as favorable for SHIB, as the token had seen a 5.69% monthly increase in cruisers and traders who hold the token between 1 and 12 months.A lower price correlation with Bitcoin (BTC) helped SHIB stay slightly in the green over the past seven days, in contrast to Dogecoin’s 3% weekly price drop. Equipped with a 0.89 price correlation with BTC, the leading asset’s plunge below $62,000 support has fiercely trimmed some of Dogecoin’s recent gains.According to Bollinger Bands, a roller coaster for Shiba Inu and Dogecoin is expected to occur soon. This aligns with the widening range of the Bollinger Bands for both canine coins in the 4-hour charts, with both tokens sporting a similar Relative Strength Index (RSI).On the Flipside
Social dominance, celebrity endorsements, and new blockchain adoption cases can also play pivotal roles in Shiba Inu and Dogecoin prices.



According to data from Santiment, the Shiba Inu coin’s social dominance metric was 0.55, while DOGE witnessed less social action with 0.52.
Why This MattersMeme coins offer a light-hearted approach to blockchain technology, building a strong narrative alongside artificial intelligence (AI) and real-world asset tokenization (RWAs).

Google I/O: The biggest new features announced for Gemini AI

Google’s best new Android feature in years is Circle to Search, which is why it took center stage at today’s Google I/O opening keynote. Google announced new updates to Gemini, the AI that powers the Android operating system. Most of the new features sound helpful, though they might seem more subtle than you were expecting.Own GameStop or AMC stock? Sell now, says strategist Google says it will reveal more about Android on Wednesday, May 15, on the second day of its developer conference. Stay tuned for those announcements.   Circle to Search your homeworkThe first big Gemini update is now available through the Circle to Search gesture. Starting today, you can use the long-press shortcut to look up answers to various physics and math word questions. Google Search will return step-by-step instructions upon query. Note that you’ll have to opt-in for help with math and word problems from the Search Labs menu for the feature to work. Google lauds in its blog that this is all possible with its LearnLM, its “new family of models fine-tuned for learning.” Honestly, my elder millennial self is jealous you kids have help like this these days. Google plans to release more STEM homework help later in the year, including the ability to identify graphs and diagrams. Gemini gains more contextDrag and drop generative images between Gemini and other apps. Image: GoogleIf it’s more context that you wanted for Google Gemini, it’s getting even more of it this year. Google announced at I/O that in an upcoming update, you will call Gemini to interact with the app you’re using. For instance, you can drag and drop a Gemini-generated image into another app like Messages or go deeper on a YouTube video without navigating away. Gemini Advanced subscribers will also have the option to query a PDF for a quick summary. This particular update will roll out “over the next few months.”Gemini Nano goes multimodal on deviceAn example of a dialog window that Gemini will pop up when it suspects a scam call is in progress. Image: GoogleGemini Nano—the smallest model in Google’s Gemini family and the one that runs on-device the Pixel hardware—will also see an update on compatible Pixel devices later this year. First, Gemini Nano will become multimodal. The AI will finally be able to process text input and audio or video simultaneously. It will benefit Android features like TalkBack, where Nano can generate descriptions for images and interface elements that don’t offer details.Gemini Nano is also powering the scam detection feature in the Phone app that Google announced during the keynote. This feature scans the conversation on-device to determine if there’s a scam happening in real-time. Google says the conversation is processed on the hardware side and doesn’t go to a server. Instead, Nano listens for trigger words and phrases and then provides feedback that you may be involved in a scam. Gemini for developersSteve Ballmer of Microsoft fame said it first: the developer conference is all about the developers, developers, developers! Google reminded its developers that Gemini is available for use in Android Studio. Developers get early access to Gemini 1.5 Pro, which can help with coding and compiling.

From ‘This is AGI’ to ‘I'm the Same’: OpenAI GPT-4o Reveal Meets Mixed Reactions - Decrypt

Before OpenAI’s tight, half-hour unveiling of its new GPT-4o AI model, rumors ran rampant about what could be announced, prompting company CEO Sam Altman to manage expectations, saying that it’s “not a search engine” but that they’ll announce “some new stuff we think people will love.” After the presentation, AI enthusiasts and the tech press were both amazed and disappointed.The release of GPT-4o—not GPT-5, as some people expected—represented a solid but incremental upgrade to GPT-4.5 Turbo. The “omnimodel” works across text, audio, and images, and offers enhanced coding skills, an emotive female voice, and faster generation times. Reactions to the news put GPT-4o and OpenAI on top of the global Twitter trends list for more than a day.The event drew immediate comparisons to Google’s Gemini Ultra, released in February. While many AI enthusiasts raved about OpenAI’s new model, some AI experts were less than impressed.Emad Mostaque, former CEO of Stability AI, shared a meme that summarized the reaction to OpenAI across IQ scores. Most of the buzz peaked around debate over whether artificial general intelligence (AGI) is imminent, but the long tail at both ends appears obsessed with “AI waifus”—virtual companions for lonely nerds.The irony was palpable, as Stability AI's Stable Diffusion model is a favored tool for creating such companions.OpenAI was especially proud of the life-like characteristics of the voice they gave to ChatGPT, which even Altman joked was similar to the virtual companion in the sci-fi film ”Her.” OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy made the same connection."The killer app of LLMs is Scarlett Johansson. You all thought it was math or something," he tweeted.Elon Musk, the mastermind behind Grok, the competing AI chatbot famous for its “fun mode,” was less subtle in sharing his review. “Demo made me cringe,” he wrote, responding to a Twitter user who said GPT-4o would only worsen a “post-truth era.”Critics honed in on the presentation's lack of a single groundbreaking feature, which largely demonstrated things that could already be done with current AI tools."I'm the same, but 20% faster," Julien Chaumond, cofounder of Hugging Face, tweeted. Meta’s chief AI researcher Yan LeCun didn’t reveal his feelings about OpenAI’s event, but did post a laughing emoji in response to Chaumond’s post.Andrew Ng, co-founder of Coursera, praised the efficiency boost: "When an agentic job that used to take 10 minutes now takes 5 minutes just by switching APIs, that's great progress," he said.Others celebrated the potential practical applications of such a powerful model, which could be tested immediately in other forms. Imran Chaudhri, the builder of the Humane AI pin, demonstrated his device using GPT-4o to play a game, highlighting the model's vision capabilities—although latency still appears to be an issue.YouTuber Arun Maini meanwhile praised GPT-4o's smooth handling of translation tasks.But some enthusiasts, like fiction writer Ewan Morrison, saw signs of a slowdown in AI development."It's evidence that the plateau for LLMs has been reached already,” he tweeted. “Open AI are doing a smoke and mirrors show to try to prevent capital flight from investors." He said he was mystified why OpenAI didn’t deliver GPT-5, which was rumored to be released this year.Digging deeper, Bindu Reddi, CEO of Abacus AI, posted results of a benchmark test indicating that GPT-4o performs worse than GPT-4.5 Turbo when prompted with long, complex coding tasks, possibly due to its multimodality.Tim Simmons from the YouTube channel Theoretically Media summed up the middle ground, saying, "I'm both overwhelmed and underwhelmed." While GPT-4o has impressive capabilities, it underwhelms in its lack of truly novel features, he said, the leap from GPT-4 being less significant than the previous jump from GPT-3.5.Despite the mixed reactions, nearly all quarters drew comparisons between GPT-4o and famous assistants like "Her" or "Jarvis" from the Marvel superhero universe. Deconstructing a summary of its language capabilities as more than “real-time voice translation,” Karpathy highlighted the significance of OpenAI releasing a natively multimodal LLM instead of linking among separate models.Tanishq Mathew Abraham, research director at Stability AI, said the live demo didn’t fully explain what was special about GPT-4o."The livestream demo is not the only cool part about GPT-4o,” he wrote. “No one is reading the GPT-4o blog post, which highlights so many other cool features," like visual text generation, visual consistency, text-to-3D capabilities, and video summarization.As for the AGI question, we’re not even close, noted NVIDIA senior research manager Jim Fan. But a new, more powerful GPT-5 may be: using the reported codename for the pending project, AI leaker Jimmy Apples suggested that GPT-4o “feels to be Gobi, or in essence Gobi,” and hinted that there would be more announcements from OpenAI in the near future.Overwhelming or underwhelming, the launch of GPT-4o has stirred the pot and has intensified the community’s attention on today’s Google I/O keynote in the hopes of seeing a strong response from a top competitor.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Crypto Analyst Predicts Sudden Bounce for Bitcoin (BTC), Updates Outlook on XRP - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader believes Bitcoin (BTC) is gearing up for a big bounce.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Credible Crypto tells his 393,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could reclaim the $68,000 level within days.










“Not much has changed here folks, but lots of alts are now hitting my downside targets/bounce zones so things are starting to line up here. Won’t rule out one more spike down into local demand and then expect that relief/reversal to the upside that we have been looking for. Let’s get it.”
Source: Credible Crypto/X
Looking at his chart, the trader suggests Bitcoin will witness one more move below $60,000 before a steep bounce toward resistance at $68,000.
Bitcoin is trading for $62,613 at time of writing, up 2.19% in the last 24 hours.
Next up, the trader says that the cross-border payments network XRP may also see rallies alongside Bitcoin.
“We held the lower trendline from my last tweet but price action is still corrective. As I think we may see some relief across the board, I want to see XRP outperform BTC on this potential move to the upside. If we can get back above $0.64 on a potential BTC relief leg to $69,000-$70,000, then there is a chance that our low at $0.43 (lower trendline) holds on a subsequent leg back down on BTC. 
Long story short, if BTC bounces soon as expected, let’s see how strong the reaction on XRP is. If it’s strong enough to get us back above $0.64, then that is a very good sign.”

XRP is trading for $0.504 at time of writing, up over 1% in the last 24 hours.

Shiba Inu Volume Flips Dogecoin, Will SHIB Price Flip DOGE If This Analyst’s Prediction Comes True?


																Shiba Inu is up by 7% in the past 24 hours amidst an uptick in the meme coin market, coming ahead of Dogecoin at this time. The meme coin niche has witnessed a strong resurgence in the past day, with the entire niche up by 7.82%. Shiba Inu has particularly done well and witnessed a strong volume of interest amidst this uptick. Interestingly, this uptick in volume for SHIB has surpassed DOGE, with on-chain data suggesting SHIB could do better in the short term. At the same time, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has revealed a phenomenon that could lead to a 20% upswing for SHIB.
Shiba Inu Volume Flips Dogecoin
Data from Coinmarketcap shows that Shiba Inu has witnessed a trading volume increase of 320% in the past 24 hours. The metric, on Dogecoin’s side, was an increase of 160%. The crypto, which has been trading inside a descending channel for a while, is now appearing to make a push above. 
Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Solana’s 1,100% Move Reveals Where The Altcoin Is Headed Next
Although current data from analytics platform IntoTheBlock (ITB) suggests DOGE is still holding on for a longer-term overperformance over SHIB, SHIB is starting to position itself to outperform DOGE in the short term on a cost basis. According to ITB’s holding by time metric, DOGE has seen a 1.86% increase in the number of holders in the past 30 days, compared to a 0.43% increase for SHIB. ITB terms holders as passive investors that have held the asset for more than one year. 
However, the number of cruisers (investors holding between 1 to 12 months) flips the short-term interest in the favor of SHIB. As of this writing, SHIB’s cruisers have increased by +5.69% in a 30-day timeframe. The metric, on DOGE’s side, shows a 2.44% decrease.

SHIB To Breakout Of Parallel Channel
The recent increase in volume and short-term activity suggests that SHIB is ready to break out of a descending parallel channel of lower highs. As pointed out on social media by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, SHIB has been trading in a descending parallel channel since the last week of April. Current price action shows SHIB is now at the upper end of the descending and is at a critical junction for a breakout or reversal. 
Related Reading: Analyst Points Out Level To Beat If Bitcoin Is To Reach $76,000
According to the analyst, a breakout from this channel at $0.00002444 could lead to another 20% upswing to $0.00002954. The price target serves as the highest point of the descending channel under consideration. A further surge could see SHIB returning back to the $0.00003 price territory. 

At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.0000236. Failure to break above $0.00002444 could send the cryptocurrency back down as far as $0.0000211.

Shiba Inu Latest Major Listing Launches It Into E-Commerce Spotlight: Book AirBnBs, Shop Online, And More | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu (SHIB) has expanded into the e-commerce market, scoring another major listing from the cryptocurrency payment platform, CoinGate. The payment company disclosed that it had boosted its cryptocurrency offerings with the doggy-themed cryptocurrency, allowing users to purchase traditional products like sports gear, gift cards and more. 
Shiba Inu New Listing
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, CoinGate announced that it had officially integrated Shiba Inu into its list of cryptocurrency payments. The popular blockchain payment processor not only listed Shiba Inu but extended its support for Polygon (MATIC) and Binance Chain (BNB). 

As a payment gateway for web-based crypto payments, CoinGate offers a variety of cryptocurrency options, including USDT, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, Tron and now Shiba Inu. On this platform, cryptocurrencies are used to buy gift cards like Amazon, Xbox, eBay and many more. 
Additionally, CoinGate acts as a gateway between the cryptocurrency industry and traditional finance, enabling the modern trade of products and services in exchange for cryptocurrencies. 
The blockchain payment processor revealed in its post that users now have the capability of using Shiba Inu tokens for a myriad of transactions, including booking Airbnb accommodations, acquiring the latest games from gaming providers like Steam and PS5, and refreshing their wardrobes with purchases from renowned brands like Nike and Zalando.  
Amidst the present soaring demand for Shiba Inu, this new listing stands as further evidence to its popularity in the cryptocurrency and financial landscape. Numerous crypto payment platforms and exchanges have added the popular meme coin to their crypto offerings this year alone. A prime example is Shiba Inu’s recent addition to Binance’s Japan listing which has exposed the cryptocurrency to Japanese markets. 
SHIB To See Major Adoption?
As a Lithuanian-based company in Europe, CoinGate opens more doors for Shiba Inu, expanding its reach to European customers in a population with millions of people. 
The integration of Shiba Inu into the e-commerce landscape also marks a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency, positioning it for widespread adoption and establishing it as a viable financial solution for facilitating international payments. 
This move not only expands the token’s already robust utility but also enhances its appeal to global audiences. As a meme coin boasting the second largest market capitalization, exceeding $14 billion, Shiba Inu has steadily gained influence, securing over 50 listings from top cryptocurrency payment providers. 

The cryptocurrency has also seen its price surge following the announcement of the new listing. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.000023, marking a 6.35% increase over the past 24 hours. 
Just a day ago, the price of the doggy-themed meme coin hovered around $0.000022. However, as investors and traders have begun showing increasing interest in Shiba Inu, the cryptocurrency experienced a remarkable 313.5% surge in its daily trading volume, surpassing $979 million.

                        One of the largest pension funds in the United States disclosed on Tuesday a $162 million allocation to the nation’s leading Bitcoin spot ETF products launched earlier this year.Per a 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) held $99 million in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of March 31.Major Pension Fund Buys Bitcoin
It also held $63 million in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is BlackRock’s largest competitor in terms of size but also charges a much heftier 1.5% annual management fee.The allocation marks a major step for Bitcoin’s adoption as a global store of value. The asset’s most fervent bulls have long wished to see it graduate from being a speculative vehicle for retail and hedge fund traders into a treasury reserve asset for corporations and governments.“Normally you don’t get these big fish institutions in the 13Fs for a year or so (when the ETF gets more liquidity),” tweeted Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchuas regarding the SWIB disclosure. “Expect more, as institutions tend to move in herds.”The reported total value of SWIB’s securities portfolio was $37.8 billion, making its Bitcoin position a mere 0.4% allocation. As of December 31, 2023, SWIB controlled $155 billion in total assets, comprising 85% of the entire Wisconsin retirement system.Who Else Is Buying Bitcoin?
While SWIB is the first pension fund to disclose Bitcoin holdings publicly, political efforts are underway to see other states buy shares of the new Bitcoin ETFs as well.Late last month, Ohio state Rep. Steve Demetriou introduced pro-crypto legislation that would, among other things, require the state’s retirement systems to evaluate Bitcoin ETFs.Aside from pension funds, major banks, including Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, hold Bitcoin ETF allocations. Experts have noted that these firms likely own shares of the funds as part of their duties as authorized participants rather than for investment purposes, however.“In a policy statement in January 2023, the Fed prohibited these banks from outright owning “crypto-assets” on their balance sheets,” added Swan Bitcoin analyst Sam Callahan on Twitter. “This whole idea of large banks owning Bitcoin ETFs because they are suddenly bullish on it is nonsense.

Claim: There is Secret Evidence That Ethereum Spot ETFs Will Be Rejected - Bitcoin Sistemi


Financial lawyer Scott Johnsson has expressed concern about the potential rejection of Ethereum Spot ETFs, which will be decided on May 23. Johnsson found evidence that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering the security issue for Ethereum (ETH) in this upcoming spot ETF decision.
“I realize this is already considered a high probability, but this is the SEC's official notification that it is considering the security question for ETH in the upcoming spot ETF order,” Johnsson said. said. Johnsson also noted that this question was never asked regarding the spot/futures Bitcoin (BTC) ETF product.


According to the SEC's requirements under 15 USC 78s(b)(2)(B), included in the published document, the SEC is required to “advise the grounds for disapproval under consideration.” Johnsson pointed out that this question was asked in Requests for Comments (RFCs) for all Ethereum applications, but he thinks it was never asked for Bitcoin applications.

Johnsson suggests that the purpose of these questions is to potentially reject applications on the basis that these spot applications are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and are ineligible if they hold a security. “Again, this is widely predicted, but I'm not sure many are aware of it,” he added.





This information was included in a request for comment following the second postponement of the commencement of proceedings. Johnsson accused the SEC of “trying to hide the ball” and admitted he missed that detail the first time.

Peter Brandt's Cryptic Message on Cardano Stirs Market Anxiety ⋆ ZyCrypto


            
            
Advertisement

&nbsp

&nbsp
Amidst a broader crypto market pullback spearheaded by Bitcoin’s wavering momentum, Cardano (ADA) is showcasing signs of vulnerability, sparking apprehension among investors.



Since reaching a peak of $0.80 in mid-March, ADA has experienced a significant decline of approximately 45%, sliding into a consolidation phase over the past four weeks. Despite steadfast support from bulls, hovering around the $0.44-$0.45 mark, indications suggest the potential for further downward movement.



Market sentiment was notably stirred by a cryptic tweet from seasoned analyst Peter Brandt on Sunday. While refraining from commenting, Brandt shared a chart depicting ADA’s previous support breach in late April, following a prolonged period above the $0.56 support level. 



Brandt’s analysis highlighted looming selling pressure, with ADA now teetering near critical support thresholds at around $0.45. A breach below the latter could signal a deeper descent, echoing Brandt’s cautionary tone.







Echoing Brandt’s concerns, other analysts pointed out bearish indicators, with one trader citing a potential breakdown if ADA fails to rectify a bearish RSI divergence and reclaim key levels.

Conversely, some maintain an optimistic outlook, drawing parallels between Cardano’s trajectory and that of Ethereum in previous cycles. Analyst Dan Gambardello, commenting on Saturday, drew comparisons between Cardano’s current downturn and Ethereum’s past performance, suggesting a cyclical pattern that could lead to future resurgence.



Analyst Javon Marks also expressed bullish sentiments, buoyed by ADA’s recent price surge. Marks projected potential gains of up to 15X, underlining ADA’s substantial progress since breaking through resistance levels.



“Prices of ADA have demonstrated significant advancement, surging by approximately +222% towards its initial target at $2.7709,” Marks told his 38,000 followers on X.



He further speculated that the recent pullback might fortify ADA’s position for further upward movement. Marks elaborated on the potential: “With this breakout holding, another +462% upside could be in the cards to reach this target. However, based on the precedent set by previous breakouts, prices could potentially soar even higher. The $7.80 level could become a reality, marking an over 1,500% increase from current levels.”







Similarly, analyst Ali Martinz recently offered a historical perspective, drawing parallels between Cardano’s current trajectory and past bullish cycles. Martinz’s analysis suggested that ADA’s recent price correction may be a precursor to a parabolic bull run, hinting at substantial upside potential.



ADA was trading at $0.43 at press time, reflecting a 2.32% drop over the past 24 hours.

Why SEC's "Remarkable Admission" Has Coinbase CLO Up in Arms - DailyCoin


        

The SEC case against DEBT Box is back in focus.



A statement in a recent SEC filing in the case has drawn the ire of Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal.



Grewal’s observations have cast doubt on whether the SEC follows due processes in crypto enforcement actions.




For crypto proponents, the SEC case against DEBT Box is the case that keeps giving.



The case has seen the federal agency slammed and sanctioned by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Shelby for “materially false and misleading representations” in attempts to prove its case that the firm defrauded investors of over $50 million. At the same time, the agency’s efforts to dismiss the case without prejudice, which could see it go after the firm again, have also failed, with DEBT Box on its part seeking a dismissal with prejudice. 




On Monday, May 13, the SEC filed to resist DEBT Box’s hunt for a case dismissal with prejudice. However, a line in this filing has drawn fire from Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal. He alleges that the statement suggests that the agency has failed to follow due process in its enforcement actions against crypto firms and is attempting to lie about it. Is the SEC failing to follow due process in crypto enforcement actions?



SEC Wells Process Questioned



Responding to a DEBT Box claim that “the SEC must provide ‘its entire investigative file’ to parties when it provides a Wells notice,” the agency, in its Monday filing, asserted that its staff “typically provides a thorough explanation of the evidence” used to prove potential charges against an entity. However, according to Grewal, who described the statement as a “remarkable admission,” this was not the case with Coinbase.



"We received no 'thorough explanation' of the evidence of what assets supposedly gave rise to securities transactions.  We weren't told what assets were at issue at all.  Why would the government not follow its 'typical' process in our case, and what does that say about its claims?" He wrote in a May 14 X post.



Grewal further implied that this issue was not limited to Coinbase alone, tagging several other crypto firms that have come into the SEC’s crosshairs.



“What about you @RobinhoodApp, [sic] did you get a ‘thorough explanation’ in your Wells process?  How about you @Ripple?  @Uniswap? @krakenfx? @BinanceUS ?  Anyone else?  




This is straight up [sic] gaslighting before Judge Shelby and the United States District Court. It should not stand,” he submitted in a rallying cry to the industry.



Unsurprisingly, Grewal’s statements have sparked a flurry of criticisms against the SEC for allegedly acting in bad faith in crypto enforcement actions. But, according to former SEC Regional Director Marc Fagel, these views may be misguided.



A Case By Case Issue



According to Fagel, the information shared in a Wells Notice depends on the case and who handles it.



"'Typically' is doing a lot of work for the SEC here. There is a wide range of practices regarding how much or how little information to share with proposed defendants during Wells discussions. Depends on the nature of the case and (unfortunately) on the particular SEC staff," he wrote in response to Grewal.



Responding to whether Grewal’s observations could be used against the SEC in the Coinbase case, he noted that they were “irrelevant” to the case.



"it's irrelevant to the lawsuit. There is no legal requirement for the SEC to share a particular amount of information (or any, for that matter) with a defendant before filing suit."



In June 2023, the SEC sued Coinbase for allegedly facilitating the trading of several unregistered securities in line with the agency’s view under Chair Gary Gensler that most crypto assets are unregistered securities. Coinbase has refuted the SEC’s classification of digital assets on the exchange, accusing the agency of trying to expand the definition of an investment contract without formal rulemaking.



On the Flipside 




The SEC has claimed that its shortcomings in the DEBT Box case resulted from negligence rather than malice.



Coinbase failed to toss the SEC case against it, with the judge siding with the agency in all but one claim.




Why This Matters



Despite calls for regulatory clarity, the SEC has continued to carry out enforcement actions against crypto firms, asserting that traditional securities laws are sufficient to guide the industry. This approach has led many to believe that the regulator is not acting in good faith with the industry. Grewal’s recent rallying cries questioning the SEC’s Wells notice process in actions against crypto firms further fuels the narrative. However, judging from Fagel’s statements, the latest claims of unfair treatment may be misguided.

Three Whales Became Active in the Last Hours: They Made Big Trades in Three Altcoins, Two of Them Memecoin - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to data provided by cryptocurrency analysis company Lookonchain, crypto whales continue to be active in recent hours.
Dogwifhat (WIF), one of the popular altcoins of late but seems to have lost the spotlight to other memecoins in recent weeks, has witnessed some whale activity. According to Onchain data, a giant whale sold $1.3 million worth of WIF tokens at $2.92.


WIF is trading at $2.83 at the time of this writing. Although it is a memecoin that has emerged in recent months, WIF has a market value even greater than Arbitrum as a cryptocurrency with a usage area.
When other whales are examined, it is observed that speculative whales are again turning to other memecoins. According to data, a cryptocurrency whale bought 195 billion PEPE 12 hours ago by spending $1.86 million USDC. According to the data, this whale has now made an unrealized profit of 236 thousand dollars.






The third and last whale is a wallet that had to close its trade with a loss. According to the data, this whale transferred the entire $ 3.33 million Worldcoin (WLD) altcoin he collected in the last month to Binance. The total loss of the whale appears to be 50 thousand dollars. He collected these whale tokens at an average price of $5.42. At the time of this writing, WLD is trading at $4.66.
After the sale of the whale, WLD continued to decline.

Google's new Gemini AI can remember your license plate number

Google CEO Sundar Pichai delivers keynote address during Google I/O 2024.Photo: GoogleGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai on Tuesday announced an AI tool that could very well quell the pleas of every young person who’s watched a parent scroll through photos on their smartphone for long minutes in search of “that one time when…”Own GameStop or AMC stock? Sell now, says strategistThe new Gemini feature, Ask Photos, allows users to task their AI assistant with finding photos. Prompts might include “Show me the best photo from each national park I’ve visited,” or “What themes have we had for Lena’s birthday parties?” In response, the chatbot will chat back with relevant photos, “saving you from all that scrolling,” the company said in its announcement during its annual Google I/O developer conference.Pichai demonstrated how customers can also use Ask Photos to retrieve specific information from within their photos. For example, he displayed, a user can ask the chabot to remind them of their license plate number; the AI will analyze pictures of their car within their camera roll to generate a response. “It knows the cars that appear often, it triangulates which one is yours, and just tells you the license plate number,” Pichai said.So how secure is an AI that sifts through our photos? Google addressed  “[W]hile Ask Photos is experimental and will not get everything right, we employ layers of safeguards and AI models to help ensure responses are safe and appropriate,” Google wrote in its online announcement of the product. But it also added that the tool will remember conversations, using corrections or extra information you provide to train itself for the future. Google plans to roll out the feature this summer “with more capabilities to come,” said Pichai. The Google chief also made several other announcements of new Google AI features, including the official rollout of AI overviews in Google Search, a new image generator Imagen 3, and a new AI chip called Trillium. It also demoed an AI assistant that can chat through a user’s phone or smart glasses.

Inflation Data Means 'If You Are Bullish, Buy Bitcoin, Bearish, Short Ethereum': 10x Research - Benzinga

This week’s inflation data releases could trigger a volatile few days for Bitcoin BTC/USD, according to a new report by 10x Research, a firm specializing in institutional crypto research.What Happened: “Traders expect a +/-6% move for Bitcoin by the end of this week,” says the report’s author, Markus Thielen.However, Thielen suggests a significant price swing may not be inevitable. “Implied volatility is not expensive,” he notes, meaning investors aren’t pricing in a dramatic move based on inflation figures.Technically, Bitcoin is currently hovering around the $60,800 to $61,400 support level. “A break below this level could trigger lower prices,” warns Thielen. He adds that the average entry price for Bitcoin ETFs sits at around $57,000, so a drop below $60,000 “could cause anxiety for those investors.”The report highlights a potential correlation between Bitcoin price movements and recent inflation data. “Bitcoin sold off after each of the last two CPI/PPI data points,” Thielen observes. These sell-offs were around 12-14% each, but ultimately halted by dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.Also Read: Wisconsin Invests Nearly $100M In BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETFWhy It Matters: While 10x Research’s inflation model predicts a slightly lower CPI number for Wednesday, it also suggests inflation will remain elevated in the near future.“Wall Street estimates are at +0.3% MoM and +3.6% YoY (vs. 3.5% previously),” the report states.“Our model leads by two months, and it appears that the model got the turning points right in the past year,” Thielen continues. “However, the data point we are receiving on Wednesday is only a tiny bit lower than the previous month, which is why there are shallow expectations that Bitcoin would make a significant move up or down based on this number.”The report downplays the possibility of a major rally even if inflation comes in lower than expected. “We doubt that lower-than-expected inflation would set off a big rally,” they write. Their model suggests CPI will stay high for a few more months before dipping towards 3%.“This would imply that Bitcoin could make a sizeable up-move on the back of lower-than-expected inflation by August, with the Fed then shifting back to verbally confirming rate cuts,” the report predicts. “Hence, we are still expecting a meaningful rally later in the year. Patience is the name of the game right now.”In the immediate future, the report acknowledges headwinds for Bitcoin. “The market structure still appears to be a roadblock for any Bitcoin rally,” they write. Additionally, the SEC’s decision on a potential Ethereum ETH/USD ETF next week could further influence market sentiment.“The best way to trade this week’s inflation data remains: if you are bullish, buy Bitcoin, bearish, short Ethereum,” concludes the report. “This week’s inflation print will likely not change this. We believe Bitcoin might see $52,000/$55,000 before a more meaningful rebound occurs.”Looking For Deeper Insights Into The Future Of Digital Assets?

                        Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal strongly criticized the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 14 regarding the Debt Box case. He also called on other crypto exchanges to query the SEC’s previous actions, considering the far-reaching implications for the sector.Coinbase Legal Officer Questions SEC “Wells Notice” Strategy
In a thread on X, the Coinbase legal officer stated that the SEC had deviated from its typical Wells Notice process in its case against Debt Box, a cryptocurrency company it sued in 2023.A Wells Notice is a formal notice from the SEC sent to a respondent informing them of the substance of the charges the regulator intends to bring against them.According to Grewal, the Wells process is meant to aid the charging decision for a potential defendant, but Coinbase did not receive such a thorough explanation in its ongoing case with the SEC. The departure from the usual procedure raised questions about the validity of the SEC’s claims.Given his strong criticism, Grewal called on other popular crypto exchanges that received Wells notices from the SEC –Ripple, Binance, Kraken, Robinhood, and Uniswap – to stand against what he called “gaslighting.”He criticized the SEC for its lack of clarity and insufficient explanation of charges against these exchanges, suggesting that the regulator’s actions may be inconsistent and arbitrary.The SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase in June 2023, alleging the company engaged in the unregistered offering and sale of securities since 2019. The legal dispute is ongoing, with the SEC recently requesting the court reject Coinbase’s appeal against the agency’s lawsuit.US Court and Financial Actors Slams SEC’s Abuse Of Power
Judge Robert Shelby of the federal district court of Utah reportedly condemned the SEC for what he called a “gross abuse” of power in accusing Debt Box of defrauding investors of over $49 million.The Judge also remarked that the SEC’s case against Debt Box was “marred by false statements and misrepresentations.” This resulted in the resignation of two SEC attorneys, as they admitted to errors but urged the judge to avoid formal punishment.These events have sparked discussions about the SEC’s alleged overreach in its enforcement actions against crypto companies. When trading app Robinhood received a Wells notice from the SEC earlier this month for alleged securities violations, Jake Chervinsk, Variant Fund’s Chief Legal Officer, pointed out that the US regulatory agency is abusing the Wells process as a “scare tactic.”Similarly, Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, another entity that recently received a Wells notice from the SEC, criticized the agency for targeting “good actors” instead of providing clearer regulations for the crypto industry.

Bitcoin L2 protocol bridge Alex suffers $4.3M in losses after suspicious upgrades - Crypto Briefing




The Alex protocol bridge on the BNB network has experienced $4.3 million in suspicious withdrawals following a sudden contract upgrade, according to a report from blockchain security platform CertiK on May 14.The incident, which CertiK labeled as “a possible private key compromise,” has raised concerns about the security of the Bitcoin layer-2 protocol’s bridges. At the time of writing, the team from Alex has yet to confirm the exploit.Data from BscScan indicates that the Alex deployer initiated five upgrades to the platform’s Bridge Endpoint contract on the BNB Smart Chain. Following these upgrades, approximately $4.3 million worth of Binance-Pegged Bitcoin (BTC), USD Coin (USDC), and Sugar Kingdom Odyssey (SKO) were removed from the BNB Smart Chain side of the bridge.The upgrade transaction call effectively changed the implementation address to unverified bytecode, rendering the change inconspicuous to human language.Further investigation into the 05ed account revealed that it had created one unverified contract on May 10 and two more on May 14, despite having no prior activity. This suspicious behavior suggests that the account may be controlled by a malicious actor attempting to exploit the Alex protocol across multiple networks.In less than an hour after the upgrades were initiated, the proxy address for the bridge contract called an unverified function on another address, transferring 16 BTC ($983,000), 2.7 million SKO ($75,000), and $3.3 million worth of USDC. Shortly after, an account ending in 05ed, which had no transaction history before May 10, attempted to make two withdrawals from the “team address.” However, these withdrawal attempts failed, triggering a “not owner” error message.According to CertiK, it is possible that the attacker may have also attempted to drain funds from other networks, given how similar upgrades for the Alex protocol were also seen on Ethereum right after its initial changes.

Jim Cramer Backs Bitcoin, Warns Against MicroStrategy Stock - DailyCoin


        

Mad Money TV host Jim Cramer advised direct Bitcoin purchases.



Cramer scolds MicroStrategy’s shares despite an 87% YTD return.



MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor’s BTC stash soared past $13B.




The controversial financial analyst Jim Cramer has dropped another bomb on his audience by claiming that Bitcoin (BTC) is a better investment than MicroStrategy stock (MSTR). In the latest episode of Mad Money hosted on CNBC, Cramer advised his audience, “If you want exposure to Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin directly,” firing shots at Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy Inc., as the large institutional enterprise is known for hefty BTC investments.




Cramer is known for his frequently incorrect remarks, sometimes even sparking rallies for Bitcoin or the alternative cryptocurrencies he advised against. This time, the urge to avoid MicroStrategy shares comes despite MSTR’s 87% year-to-date run, with the asset performing below Bitcoin’s 130% year-to-date profit. As of press time, MSTR trades at $1,270.







Meanwhile, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor’s cryptocurrency wallet holds a whopping $13,300,507,953.60, now 75.33% up since its creation.



MicroStrategy Maintains Bullish Stance on Bitcoin



Paying $821 million for ₿12,000 at $68,477, the famed Bitcoin Maxi continued to acquire BTC after it claimed a new all-time peak at $73,737. However, Bitcoin’s journey since its all-time high has been challenged by inconsistent action in Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



The largest Bitcoin ETF management enterprise, Grayscale, has witnessed a flood of exiting positions due to BTC ETF fees, while the recently introduced Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong have incurred more redemptions than deposits for three days in a row. 519.5 Bitcoins were redeemed on May 13, 2024, leaving the total Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF count at 3,560.







Previously, Cramer had a backward effect on Bitcoin’s movement and even launched an Inverse Cramer ETF to capitalize on the opposite outcome. If the Inverse Cramer theory still holds, recommending buying BTC directly could impose an extra challenge for the leading digital asset. As of press time, BTC trades at $61,828, with a 1.8% drop over the past 24 hours.



On the Flipside




Alongside Tuesday’s stagnant Bitcoin (BTC) price movement, the drawdown below $62,000 comes with substantial sell pressure on Spot markets.



Over the past 24 hours, there have been $5.67 billion in sales in BTC, in comparison to $1.32 billion in BTC bids, according to CoinPaprika data.

Ethereum Spot ETF Hurdles: Expert Raises Concerns Over US SEC's ETH Security Review | Bitcoinist.com


								As the cryptocurrency world anxiously awaits the decision regarding Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), much has been said about the variables that could influence the Commission’s ruling. 
Author and finance lawyer Scott Johnsson enters the discussion and highlights an important point: the SEC might consider Ethereum’s security status when deciding on the exchange products in the upcoming days, particularly on May 31.
Ethereum Security Question Poises Approval Hurdles
In an X post, Scott Johnsson shared a few screenshots that highlight the question of whether the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq” or “Exchange”) has properly filed its proposal to list and trade Shares of the iShares Ethereum Trust under Nasdaq Rule 5711(d), Commodity-Based Trust Shares, given the nature of the underlying assets held by the trust. 
With the Commodity-Based Trust Shares being defined as a security, the question suggests that the SEC might be classifying ETH as a security, which poses a potential setback to the spot ETH ETFs.

While Johnsson thinks this is a possibility being discussed publicly, he believes it is official proof that the SEC is considering the security question for ETH in the impending spot ETF verdict. This is because this question was never raised when considering the same products for the largest cryptocurrency asset, Bitcoin.
The Post read:
I’m aware this is widely considered a possibility, but this is your official notice that the SEC is considering the security question for ETH in this upcoming spot ETF order. Note that this question was never (AFAICT) asked regarding a spot/futures BTC ETF product.
According to the lawyer, 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B) mandates that the SEC give notice of the grounds for rejection under consideration. Although the question above was never asked or observed for a Bitcoin spot ETF filing, it was raised for every ETH spot ETF filing in their Request For Comments (RFCs).
The evident goal why the SEC brought up this question according to Johnsson is to maybe reject Ethereum spot ETFs on the grounds that the filings do not qualify if they are holding securities and were filed incorrectly as commodity-based trust shares. 
Johnsson states that the broader crypto space considers his insights a potential reason behind the SEC’s action, but there could be more to the development than the community knows.
Final Reviewable Agency Action
Before the May 31 deadline, Johnsson claims the SEC will most likely provide at least 30 pages of analysis addressing whether or not it believes an Ethereum spot ETF complies with Exchange Act regulations. Thus, it will be the last agency action that can be reviewed before the deadline.

Furthermore, they will have to go beyond the framework they established to approve Bitcoin futures and spot products under the Securities Act of 1933 and the restrictions imposed on them after the GBTC verdict by the DC Circuit. 
Johnsson believes there are several options available to the regulatory watchdog, and each will have far-reaching consequences.

Intro to GPT-4o | Bankless


This week, OpenAI introduced its new state-of-the-art AI model: GPT-4o.It’s a beast—preliminary tests show it blowing other major models out of the water when it comes to basic and complex prompt requests. via William FedusThe “o” in GPT-4o stands for omni, as it was designed from the start to support real-time inputs and outputs via audio, text, and visuals or any combo thereof. This approach is optimized over regular ChatGPT-4, which is still powerful, though mainly centered around text-based interactions. In contrast, GPT-4o is streamlined to understand and generate content from text, images, and sounds, making it a versatile tool for all sorts of applications. Additionally, GPT-4o is faster at voice responses, more accurate in non-English languages, and 50% more efficient than its predecessor model. These improvements make GPT-4o more practical for everyday use cases, with basically endless personal and professional possibilities. via OpenAIFor example, imagine generating a script, visual storyboard, and audio cues for a VR experience all within the same platform. Or creating a metaversal art installation that can respond to visual and audio inputs from viewers through the GPT-4o API.Of course, one of the most exciting things GPT-4o is that, for the first time, a major breakthrough AI model like this is available for free to try by anyone, with no premium subscription to ChatGPT required. As OpenAI noted in their announcement yesterday:“GPT-4o’s text and image capabilities are starting to roll out today in ChatGPT. We are making GPT-4o available in the free tier, and to Plus users with up to 5x higher message limits. We'll roll out a new version of Voice Mode with GPT-4o in alpha within ChatGPT Plus in the coming weeks.”That said, if you’re interested in trying the new GPT-4o model, head over to chatgpt.com, sign in or create an account, and then check and see if it’s already available to you in the “Models” dropdown menu like so:via ChatGPTRemember that the full voice and video capabilities of GPT-4o aren’t rolled out to everyone yet, but these will be coming in the near future. In the meantime, get to prompting and experimenting as a free or premium user, as you’ll want to see this kind of power for yourself. Also, be sure to check out some of the new demo videos to get a better feel for what this impressive model has to offer going forward:

XRP Price Prediction with Binance Futures Halting XRP as Margin Asset – Time to Sell XRP? / Source: TradingView
                        The XRP (XRP) price continues to languish to the south of its 21DMA near $0.50, not helped by the news that Binance will discontinue support for the use of XRP as a margin asset for trading, with traders asking whether now might be the time to sell XRP.Binance users will now no longer be able to use XRP in as margin in the Multi-Assets Mode.The stablecoin TUSD was also discontinued as a margin asset. Binance didn’t give any explanation as to why they removed these assets.But when the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange and trading venue removes support for a crypto as a margin asset, that’s a blow to its utility.The XRP price was flat on the day, suggesting traders don’t seem overly concerned.But Binance’s move could reinforce the cryptocurrency’s bearish trend that has been in play since March highs.Near-term XRP price predictions remain bearish. Here’s why some chart analysts think it might be time to sell XRP.
XRP Price Prediction – Time to Sell XRP?
The XRP price has been consolidating between the upper-$0.40s and $0.56 level in recent weeks.$0.56 is a key resistance zone, where support from March/early-April, the 50 and 100DMA and previously also the downtrend from the March highs all coincided.XRP’s two failures to break above $0.56 in recent weeks is a sign bears remain in control of the market.Chart analysis suggests a retest of April lows around $0.4250 is likely.The XRP price has been in a downtrend since its March highs and could soon retest April lows. Source: TradingViewThat could mean a short-term 15% drop for XRP. Investors would be forgiven for considering selling their holdings.And now might be a good time to do so. XRP has long been an underperformer versus crypto assets with a better adoption outlook like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH).XRP is only 74% up versus its recent bear market lows, and remains 84% down versus all-time highs (ATHs).Ether is up 230% versus its 2022 lows and is down only 40% versus 2021 ATHs.Bitcoin, meanwhile, is up nearly 300% from its 2021 lows and is only down 17% from this year’s ATHs.XRP may be winning its lawsuit versus the SEC, but it lacks a major adoption narrative.Bitcoin, Ether, and many other major cryptocurrencies have a much better outlook this bull market. It may be time to sell XRP.Instead of piling all of these funds into BTC, traders looking to add some upside risk should consider meme coins.Major meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) are a good bet for potential 5x gains.For meme coin investors looking for higher upside potential, they will need to look for smaller, lesser-known meme coins.One new crypto that the team at Cryptonews are a big fan of is fun new Sausage-dog themed meme coin Wiener AI (WAI).
XRP Alternative to Consider – Wiener AI (WAI)Wiener AI comes with a suite of exciting AI trading capabilities and is currently available in presale.As hype rapidly builds for the token’s launch, the presale has already raked in over $1.8 million.Interested investors considering joining the “Sausage army”, Wiener AI’s community, need to move quickly.That’s because the WAI price will rise when the presale reaches $2.15 million.Currently priced at $0.000707, investors are buying WAI at a market cap of under $50 million.20% of the supply has been allocated to staking rewards.As a result, presale investors are currently earning a massive 538% APY, as per the project’s official website.Wiener AI has all the makings of a coin that could reach hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.WAI presale investors could be set to lock in 10x or more gains.Visit Wiener AI Here

Solana's $107M Inflow from Other Chains Reveals Curious Truth - DailyCoin


        

Over $107 million was bridged to Solana from multiple blockchains in early May.



The figure shows the extent of cross-chain transfers. 



Cross-chain transfers facilitated by Wormhole and deBridge Finance.




Solana, known for its high throughput capabilities, has recently been the center of substantial financial activity. In the first two weeks of May, over $107 million was moved to Solana from various other chains, including Ethereum. 



This movement was enabled by bridging technologies such as Wormhole and deBridge Finance, which are pivotal in facilitating these transfers. However, the figure only shows one part of the picture. 



Solana Sees Spike in Cross-Chain Activity



In the first two weeks of May, Solana saw increased cross-chain activity. Notably, the network saw a total inflow of $107 million from various chains, including Ethereum, Base, and others. This traffic was facilitated by cross-chain platforms Wormhole and deBridge Finance. 




According to the data from these platforms, most inflows to Solana came from Ethereum. On Wormhole, Ethereum inflows accounted for $36 million, while those on Wormhole were at $26 million for the same period.  







A significant inflow came from Base, Coinbase’s native network, Arbitrum, Sui Network, and Aptos. However, Solana also experienced significant outflows to these networks. These amounted to $96 million across Wormhole and deBridge Finance. This leaves Solana with a net inflow of $11 million over that period. 



Despite the relatively modest net inflows, the figures reveal the extent of cross-chain activity in most major chains. Traders, rather than staying on one network, often move their assets to different chains, either to convert their assets or seek opportunities where they present themselves.



Solana Memecoins Attract Traders From Other Chains



Solana has recently attracted traders from other chains, thanks to the surging interest in memecoins. Specifically, traders appreciate Solana’s low fees and high speeds, making it ideal for small purchases. These features also attract high-frequency traders, including bots, further boosting Solana’s traffic. 




However, having made their profits, many traders opt to convert their assets to other cryptos, including those on chains like Ethereum. On the other hand, some use their profits to invest in opportunities in other chains, including Base and Sui.  



This cross-chain activity underscores the substantial role interoperability protocols like Wormhole and deBridge Finance play in the blockchain. These platforms allow seamless transfers between disparate blockchains, boosting their liquidity. 



On the Flipside




A high degree of interoperability will make keeping users on their platforms difficult for any specific chain. If traders can seamlessly move assets across chains, user retention will become an issue. 



Solana has been battling with network congestion issues, leading to a high degree of transaction failures. Despite emerging over a month ago, these issues have still not been resolved. 




Why This Matters



The substantial volume of inflows to Solana demonstrates significant inter-network activity. It points to the growing importance of multi-chain solutions for the future.

The Hard Truths and Worrying Consequences of the Tornado Cash Verdict

Indeed, part of Pertsev’s defense was acknowledging that, even if money laundering was happening, because the protocol operated like a robot on a blockchain and users always maintained "exclusive control” over their funds, if anyone is to blame it is the users themselves. This is to say nothing that Tornado’s devs did maintain a frontend, through which 90+% of users went through.

Alex bridge on BNB Smart Chain drained of $4.3M after suspicious upgrade - CertiK

According to a May 14 report from blockchain security platform CertiK, the Alex protocol bridge on the BNB Smart Chain network suffered $4.3 million in suspicious withdrawals just after its contract was suddenly upgraded.Alex is a Bitcoin layer-2 protocol. According to its official website, it provides decentralized finance applications on Bitcoin. Its bridges are used to transfer assets from other networks, such as BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum, to its own network.Blockchain data confirms that the Alex deployer account performed five identical upgrades to the “Bridge Endpoint” contract on BNB Smart Chain beginning at 3:56 pm UTC. Approximately $4.3 million worth of Binance-Pegged Bitcoin (BTC), USD Coin (USDC), and Sugar Kingdom Odyssey (SKO) were subsequently removed from the BNB Smart Chain side of the bridge.Because the upgrade was performed by the protocol’s deployer account, CertiK labeled the event “a possible private key compromise.” Source: CertiKThe upgrade transaction changed the implementation address to one ending in 7058. The new implementation is unverified bytecode, making it unreadable to human beings.About 48 minutes after these upgrades began, the proxy address for the bridge contract called an unverified function on an address ending in 4848E. This resulted in 16 BTC ($983,000 at current prices), 2.7 million SKO ($75,000) and $3.3 million worth of USDC at 4:44 pm, being moved into the address at 484E.The attacker may also be attempting to drain funds on other networks. At 5:41 pm, just minutes after the suspicious upgrade on BNB Smart Chain, a similar series of Alex upgrades occurred on Ethereum. In this case, the deployer upgraded the “artist address” to an unverified contract. Immediately afterward, an account ending in 05ed attempted to make two withdrawals from the “team address.” These withdrawals failed, producing a “not owner” error. The 05ed account had no history before May 10. It created one unverified contract on May 10 and two more on May 14, indicating that it may be under the control of a malicious user.At the time of publication, the Alex team has not confirmed the exploit or commented on the incident.The Alex bridge wasn’t the only protocol to face a potential exploit in May. On May 13, decentralized exchange Equalizer announced that it had lost more than 2,000 of its own tokens from an attacker who siphoned them away in small increments over several days. The Gnus.ai hack on May 6 also resulted in $1.27 million worth of losses.Related: CertiK discovered $5M security flaw in Wormhole bridge on Aptos

How Will Tomorrow's US CPI Data Affect Bitcoin? Analyst Reveals BTC Price Prediction for Both Scenarios - Bitcoin Sistemi

Investors are waiting for the April consumer price data to be announced. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), an important indicator of inflation, is expected to show an improvement compared to March.
However, if the data reveals unexpected shocks, the price of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, could fall as much as 13% to $53,000, according to a report by digital asset trading firm Zerocap.


CPI data in the USA will be published tomorrow at 15:30 Türkiye time (UTC+3).
“An unexpectedly high CPI could trigger a media frenzy and lead to short-term declines in risk assets given current concerns about stagflation,” Zerocap warned in its report on Monday. Zerocap added that, on the other hand, it could push Bitcoin back to $65,000 if data shows hopeful signs that inflation is cooling.





Crypto enthusiasts are expected to examine CPI data for any indication that inflation is continuing or decreasing. According to analysts, a decline in inflation could prompt the Fed to lower interest rates, which could benefit riskier assets such as Bitcoin by lowering the cost of borrowing and therefore investment.

Markets are expecting a rate cut in September after employment and wages in the US were lower than expected the previous month, investment giant BlackRock said in its market report on Monday.


Despite short-term uncertainties, the long-term outlook for the U.S. economy remains positive, according to David Brickell, head of international distribution at FRNT Financial, and Chris Mill, a former forex trader. “Given the emerging macro dynamic, it is not a question of if we will make new highs for Bitcoin, but when,” he wrote in the “Connecting the Dots” newsletter. they wrote.

Bitcoin price loses steam, but futures markets forecast upside above $70K

Bitcoin (BTC) dropped 3.3% on May 14, retesting the $61,000 support level, which was quickly defended. More importantly, this correction marked the second failed attempt within a week to surpass $63,500. Despite the less-than-optimal price action, Bitcoin bulls remain confident, as shown by BTC derivatives metrics.Although the current Bitcoin price trend appears bearish, some analysts believe it still has a good chance to revisit prices above $70,000.Source: CryptotoadTrader and analyst Cryptotoad was impressed by how long the $60,500 support level has held. However, he asserts that a higher high, likely a daily close above $67,000, is needed to break the current bearish pattern. While this analysis does not rule out a potential price recovery, it clearly indicates that the trend points to prices below $57,000 in May.U.S. inflation data puts short-term pressure on Bitcoin priceInvestor disappointment on May 14 stemmed partly from the United States Producer Price Index (PPI) data for April, which showed a 0.5% month-over-month increase. The market interpreted the wholesale inflationary pressure as confirmation that the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) will keep interest rates higher for longer, which is detrimental to risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies and growth stocks.Some argue that inflation is inherently positive for Bitcoin’s performance due to its strict monetary policy. However, during initial phases of fear and uncertainty, investors tend to seek cash and short-term bonds. Yields on 2-year U.S. Treasury notes dropped to 4.84% on May 14 from 5.03% on May 1, indicating that traders are paying a higher price for these fixed-income instruments.It might seem counterintuitive to seek protection from an economic recession in U.S. Treasurys, but these assets are considered the safest as they are directly backed by the government, unlike money market funds managed by financial institutions. Therefore, while higher-than-anticipated inflation data should have triggered negative sentiment for Bitcoin, this was not reflected in derivatives data.Bitcoin derivatives show resilience despite lackluster BTC price actionTo analyze if professional traders have become more pessimistic about Bitcoin following its drop to $61,000, one should examine BTC monthly futures contracts. In neutral markets, these contracts typically trade at a 5% to 10% premium relative to BTC spot markets to account for the longer settlement period.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chData indicates that the annualized BTC futures premium was largely unaffected by the worsening macroeconomic conditions and Bitcoin’s repeated failure to sustain prices above $63,500 over the past week. The current 8% premium stands right in the middle of the neutral market, leaving a decent margin for negative surprises.Related: Bitcoin hash rate dips as miners turn off unprofitable ASICs post-halvingOne should proceed by examining the Bitcoin options market to determine if the demand for hedges increased after the most recent price correction. Typically, if market makers and whales expect a Bitcoin price drop, the BTC options skew metric will exceed 7%, whereas periods of enthusiasm often show a skew below -7%.Bitcoin 1-month options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas.chThe BTC options 25% delta skew has remained in a neutral range since May 8, meaning market participants have priced call (buy) and put (sell) instruments similarly. According to this metric, the weakness in Bitcoin’s price did not impact how these professional traders assess risks for downside swings.Bitcoin bears got what they wanted by displaying strength, as the last daily close above $65,000 happened three weeks ago, on April 23. However, bulls did not seem to be impacted by the lack of momentum, which appears mostly driven by investors’ temporary shift toward cash positions. If the inflationary issue in the U.S. persists, market participants may be forced to look for alternatives, so Bitcoin’s path to $70,000 for 2024 remains well in play.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Lightspeed Newsletter: Solana caught the layer-2 bug - Blockworks


Hiya!
Markets may be down slightly, but that’s not the main thing bumming me out today. Last night, I took a train all the way up to Queens just to see the Mets blow a 9th-inning lead. What even is a “Phillie?”
Anyways, let’s talk Solana.

Pandora’s Box of L2s
Solana’s lack of layer-2s has long been a point of pride for some Solana supporters. 
Rather than relying on a fragmented and expanding network of blockchains to scale à la Ethereum, why not just move to a blockchain fast and cheap enough to keep everyone in the same building?
But since fast things can always be faster, and cheap things cheaper, the layer-2 bug appears to be coming for Solana. 
Zeta Markets announced a $5 million raise Tuesday, partially to build a DeFi layer-2 on Solana. Electric Capital led the round, which added to the $8.5 million Zeta Markets raised in a 2021 seed round led by Jump Capital. 
Zeta Markets currently runs a regular derivatives DEX — the fifth-largest on Solana, according to DefiLlama. By adding a layer-2 to the mix, it wants to make its DEX as fast as a CEX.
Zeta Markets founder Tristan Frizza told me that he’s always been a “monolithic chain maxi,” but when you’re letting traders take big leverage on derivatives, market makers want to see some really low latency.
“Solana does what, 400 millisecond block times? But these guys are used to like 10 milliseconds on Binance,” Frizza said.
Off-chain centralized exchanges can basically figure out the price of assets faster than decentralized exchanges, which are slowed down by the underlying blockchain’s throughput. In some cases, savvy arbitrageurs can exploit the momentary differences in price — to the detriment of DEX liquidity providers. 
So, there are justifiable reasons beyond snake oil sales for why Solana would want to build layer-2s. Still, it bears notice that Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko — who invested in this Zeta Markets round — appeared on Lightspeed in August asserting that having too many layer-2s can create massive composability and user experience problems. Other notable Solana ecosystem angel investors also took part in Zeta’s round.
Perhaps this signals that Solana’s thought leaders are softening toward rollups. 
Zeta’s layer-2 is set to launch in the first quarter 2025, The Block reported. By then, I wouldn’t be surprised to see other Solana projects following suit.

Zero In

Solana’s fee generation looks to be rapidly closing the gap with Uniswap. Over the past year, Uniswap’s fees stand at $751.193 million, while Solana’s reach $185.173 million; that’s about $14.446 million and $3.562 million per week, respectively. 
However, Solana’s fees have risen sharply over the past week to $10.078 million, nearly matching Uniswap’s $12.260 million. Interest in the Solana network continues to increase, thanks at least in part to Solana’s high network uptime, low transaction fees, and ever-increasing user adoption in the DeFi and NFT segments. 
If this trend continues, Solana could soon surpass Uniswap in fee generation. This rise suggests growing network usage and transaction volume, which — while positive for Solana’s ecosystem — could also mean higher costs for users​.

The Pulse
If you’ve ever spent time exploring Solanaland, you’ve probably come across the term OPOS — Only Possible on Solana. And while this may sound exaggerated to the uninitiated, it is true that certain innovations are indeed only achievable within the Solana ecosystem. Well, for the most part… kind of… at least for now.
The idea isn’t so much that other blockchains can’t do what Solana is capable of, full stop. It’s more that there are a lot of things that other chains just can’t do quite so well. 
For instance, Solana’s state compression technology drastically reduces the cost of storing data on-chain. That makes large-scale transactions far more feasible, and is why projects like Drip Haus are able to affordably distribute millions of NFTs to users across the ecosystem. Other blockchains, which famously struggle with scalability and high fees, would have a tough time developing similar projects.
Projects like Hivemapper and Helium also benefit from Solana’s high throughput and low costs in support of their decentralized mapping and community-powered 5G services. This is yet another area where transaction speeds and costs hinder the practical implementation of such large-scale decentralized applications for most other chains.
But while Solana holds the advantage in these areas for now, there is little reason to believe it will stay that way forever. Competing networks are assuredly taking notes on what is and isn’t working across Web3, and may soon develop similar or even superior capabilities. So the question is: Will Solana be able to keep up with these challenges over the long term? Anything is possible.

Bitcoin Likely To Remain Stuck Between $55k-$75k - Crypto Billionaire Mike Novogratz ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Mike Novogratz, one of the first crypto billionaires and founder of financial services company Galaxy Digital, predicted that Bitcoin would likely remain within the $55k-$75k price range for now. Novogratz is known for his long-term bullish position on Bitcoin, but he believes that crypto’s penetration in conventional finance will take time. His company has benefitted from the massive price gains made by Bitcoin in the first two quarters of 2024.



Novogratz Reveals Massive Quarterly Figures for Galaxy Digital



Novogratz was speaking at a conference call as his company unveiled its first performance of the first quarter; net income has surged 300% to a massive $421 million. He said:



“We are in the consolidation phase in crypto. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and everything else Solana will consolidate; what does that mean? It means probably somewhere between $55,000 and $75,000 until the next set of circumstances, the next set of market events bring us higher,”



The crypto market, especially BTC itself, has remained stagnant for several weeks as the hype around the spot Bitcoin ETFs and the Bitcoin Halving cooled off. This is happening after a record pre-halving run by the premier digital currency. It has risen around 78% since the turn of the year, one of the biggest surprises in the crypto market’s history.



Bitcoin is starting to consolidate, Novogratz argues, and the recent one-month price movement supports his claim:

The premier crypto asset has been trading between the relatively narrow $60k-$67k trading range for much of the last 30 days, apart from a brief drop to $57k at the start of this month. According to Novogratz, his proposed $55k-$75k trading range will be the status quo, at least for this quarter and probably the next one. Novogratz is known to make accurate predictions, just like he did with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in December.



What Could be the Next Bullish Signal for the Crypto Market?



The cryptocurrency markets are looking for a new external stimulus to kickstart the next stage of the 2024-2025 bull market. Novogratz believes it can be either a successful general election that brings regulatory clarity to crypto or a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve.



The US election is in November, while a rate cut remains elusive because of the current economic situation. So, the two probable stimuli proposed by the first crypto billionaire Reserve are unlikely to present themselves shortly, thus prolonging the current consolidation phase.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana: Galaxy Digital CEO Predicts Next Market Movements


																Mike Novogratz, the CEO and founder of Galaxy Digital, shared his insights on the current state of the cryptocurrency market. According to Bloomberg, Novogratz predicts that Bitcoin (BTC) will likely remain within a relatively narrow trading range for the current quarter as the adoption of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance continues to evolve.
Stagnant Crypto Market
Per the report, Novogratz described the current phase in the crypto market as a consolidation period. He emphasized that Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), are expected to consolidate. 
This consolidation phase suggests that the Bitcoin price will likely trade within a range of approximately $55,000 to $75,000 until significant market events drive prices higher.

	Related Reading



The crypto market has experienced a period of stagnation following the historic bull run witnessed in the past two quarters. This surge was fueled by the launch of spot US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the Bitcoin Halving, which reduced the supply of new BTC. 
However, Bitcoin’s price trend reversed due to diminishing optimism surrounding interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed), amid consistently strong economic indicators.
According to Novogratz’s analysis, if his predictions hold, Solana could continue to consolidate within its current trading range of $120 to $150. This consolidation has been observed over the past month, indicating a period of stability for the cryptocurrency.
Similarly, Ethereum’s price has closely mirrored Bitcoin’s movements and has traded between the $2,870 and $3,200 levels. 
Ethereum recently failed to consolidate above the significant $4,000 mark reached in mid-March. As a result, Ethereum has experienced a period of price consolidation within the range above.
Bitcoin Volatility Persists
Novogratz acknowledged the tailwinds that propelled the market during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. 
Galaxy’s CEO believes that these tailwinds will likely persist throughout the current quarter and possibly the next unless there are significant developments, such as the Fed initiating rate cuts due to an economic slowdown or until the regulatory landscape becomes clearer after the upcoming election.
Moreover, Novogratz noted a significant shift in counterparties’ willingness to lend crypto for extended periods without collateral, a trend that was not prevalent just six months ago. He emphasized that engagement in the crypto space has reached a new level, with growing interest from individuals and institutions alike.

On Tuesday, Bitcoin experienced a 2.7% decline, trading at $61,400. Since achieving a record high of $73,700 on March 14, the largest cryptocurrency in the market has undergone a 16% decline. Despite this, Galaxy Digital reported notable first-quarter results, with net income more than tripling to $421.7 million.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin is currently trading at $61,500, with a 24-hour trading volume of $28.28 billion. The cryptocurrency has dropped about 2.25% in the past day. Ranked first on Cryptonews, Bitcoin boasts a market cap of $1.21 trillion, with a circulating supply of 19,698,325 BTC and a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC.The U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF market has seen a significant $66 million inflow, marking a reversal from the outflow trend observed over the past two days. This surge is led by Fidelity’s FBTC, highlighting renewed investor interest in cryptocurrency-backed exchange-traded funds. Additionally, this influx coincides with a recovery in Bitcoin’s price.Fidelity’s FBTC Leads Bitcoin Inflow Surge
Bitcoin ETFs saw a significant turnaround, with a $66 million net inflow after two days of outflows, according to Farside Investors. Leading this recovery is Fidelity’s FBTC, which attracted $38.6 million in inflows, followed by Bitwise Bitcoin ETF BITB with $20.3 million.This influx demonstrates renewed trader confidence in Bitcoin ETFs, coinciding with Bitcoin’s recent surge past the $63,000 mark. The rise in inflows also suggests a growing appetite for cryptocurrency investments amid overall market volatility.Key Points:
Net inflow of $66 million on May 13, reversing two days of outflows.
Fidelity’s FBTC led with $38.6 million, followed by Bitwise Bitcoin ETF BITB with $20.3 million.
No outflows were reported, but seven out of ten US Bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscale and BlackRock, reported zero flows.
Over the last 30 trading days, the ten Bitcoin ETFs experienced a net outflow of $297 million, with outflows on 17 of those days. The recent $66 million inflow signals renewed bullish sentiment, particularly with Fidelity’s FBTC capturing the majority of the new investments.This trend highlights the ongoing interest in Bitcoin ETFs, reflecting investors’ shifting strategies and confidence levels.Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin‘s 4-hour chart shows that BTC is hovering around a pivot point of $61,450, signaling slightly bullish Bitcoin price prediction. This level is crucial as it may determine the next major price movement. The symmetrical triangle pattern around this pivot point indicates potential volatility, suggesting that Bitcoin could break out in either direction.On the downside, immediate support is found at $60,185. Should Bitcoin break below this level, it could target the next support levels at $58,550 and $56,645, indicating areas where buyers might step in to halt further declines.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 47, indicating neutral momentum in the market. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $61,975, which currently exerts slight downward pressure on the price.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewConclusion: Bitcoin remains cautiously bullish above the $61,450 pivot point. If it breaks below this level, it could lead to a sharp decline towards $60,185, $58,550, and possibly $56,645.Conversely, a breakout above $63,250 could drive the price towards $65,500 and $67,222.

Google Pushes Gemini AI Upgrades Into Everything, Steamrolling OpenAI's ChatGPT - Decrypt

The day after OpenAI's much-hyped announcement of GPT-4o, its improved “omnimodal” large language model, Google fired back with a barrage of upgrades to its Gemini AI offerings, flexing its technological prowess, leaning into its live search advantages, and solidifying its standing against mindshare leader ChatGPT.Building upon its strengths, Google is infusing generative AI into its search experience, enabling users to interact naturally with its search engine rather than relying on keyword-based queries. The keynote included a demonstration of a Google search query about removing a coffee stain. Instead of merely displaying links to webpages with instructions, the search engine immediately provided a comprehensive answer generated by AI.These AI-generated results, designed to address user queries directly and efficiently, will be displayed above search results.Throughout the presentation, Google made clear that its dominance in web search translated into a key advantage for its AI initiatives, showing off how various features could tap into current information rather than relying on a dated snapshot like other large-language models (LLM).One of the standout features announced is ”Ask Photos,” which allows users to have natural conversations with Gemini to search for information in their gallery. While Google Photos has long allowed people to search their image library for specific people, objects, or words, the AI-infused update supports open-ended, natural-language queries.For example, a Google user asked Gemini what his car’s license plate number was. Gemini scoured through all of his photos, evaluated them, and provided the correct answer.Another upgrade would be familiar to users of a litany of AI meeting assistants, including those built into online conference platforms like Zoom. In Google Meet, Gemini can now analyze meetings, summarize them, and generate responses to questions in the chat. After a meeting, Gemini provides a list of action items and task assignments.The biggest news involved upgrades under the hood. Google today announced the release of Gemini 1.5 Pro, boasting a staggering context window of 1 million multimodal tokens. That capacity dwarfs GPT-4's 128,000-token limit and is already available for both developers and consumers in Gemini Advanced—the tech giant’s paid AI services tier.Image: GoogleGoogle says it plans to expand its token handling capacity even further later this year, potentially reaching up to 2 million tokens for developers and a tenfold increase over that of GPT-4o.Thanks to its massively increased capacity, Google also showed off Gemini’s impressive retrieval capabilities. This is a key feature, because until now, powerful LLMs like Claude or GPT-4 show a performance degradation—“forgetting” information previously discussed—when prompted with huge amounts of data.Besides its top of the line models, Google launched Gemini 1.5 Flash, a compact multimodal LLM designed to compete against Claude 3 Haiku and GPT-3.5 in providing quick answers. However, its 1 million token handling capacity positions it as the most powerful "light" model available to date.Probably the most interesting announcement was Google’s Project Astra, a universal AI agent that can be personalized and tailored to each user's needs. Google pointed out that the Astra presentation was recorded in real-time, likely in response to OpenAI’s live GPT-4o demo yesterday. The interaction seemed more capable and less clunky than GPT-4o, albeit with more concrete and less human-like responses.While Gemini's voice is also broadly natural, it lacks the emotional—or even “flirty”—quality of OpenAI's new ChatGPT voice. Google’s priority appears to be functionality, versus OpenAI’s emphasis on more human-like interactions.Going beyond traditional language models, Google introduced cross-platform customizable AI agents that it says are capable of reasoning, planning, and memorizing. These abilities allow Gemini to behave like a group of specialized AIs working together.These API-based connections, which Google described as "Gems," seem to be a response to OpenAI’s customizable GPTs. Gems integrate seamlessly with Google's ecosystem, offering features like real-time language translation, contextual search, and personalized recommendations. Users can shape Gems to focus on specific tasks or topic areas, or use a specific tone.Image: GoogleGoogle also announced new generative AI models for images, videos, and music. Imagen 3, Google's new image generator, provides highly realistic and detailed images, contrasting with OpenAI's cartoonish look. They also claim it excels at generating text, a feature OpenAI also claims to have improved.They also launched an upgraded version of MusicLM for generative music enthusiasts.The icing on the cake was Veo, a Generative Video model, announced ahead of the release of OpenAI’s much touted but yet unreleased Sora video tool. The unedited raw output suggests a quality level comparable to the forthcoming OpenAI entry. Google says it will make Veo available in a few weeks—a timeline that could beat Sora to market.Toward the end of its two-hour-plus keynote, Google also showed some love to the open-source community, unveiling Pali Gemma, an open-source vision model. The company also promised to launch Gemma 2—the next iteration of its open-source large language model—in June. The new model will have an extended token context window and will be more powerful and accurate.Finally, Google announced that it was first releasing its suite of Gemini-powered features on its Android mobile operating system. It follows OpenAI’s apparent favoritism for Apple’s MacOS and iOS platforms, where it was releasing its latest updates before doing so on Windows, created by top investor Microsoft.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Hong Kong Crypto ETFs Witness Record $40 Million in Outflows ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Hong Kong’s recently launched Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) witnessed considerable outflows on Monday. Despite these ETFs experiencing two weeks of consecutive inflows, one bad day at the start of this week virtually wiped out the gains made in the last two weeks.



How Did Hong Kong ETFs Fare?



The newly launched crypto ETFs witnessed the largest outflow since their listing in the Asian market. This is despite the American ETFs recording a net inflow of $66 million on the same day.



Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs include AMC, Harvest, and Bosera. They reported outflows of $15.5 million, $9.8 million, and $7.4 million, respectively. Ethereum ETFs include exchange offerings by the same three companies, and they reported outflows of $3 million, $3 million, and $0.6 million, respectively.



Many investors viewed Hong Kong’s listing of Bitcoin and ETH ETFs favorably. For crypto enthusiasts, it meant that the digital currency was going further mainstream and could attract investments from this side of the world as well.



Further emphasis was placed on Hong Kong’s interesting political situation, which could pour billions into the crypto scene. Many of these funds don’t have access to crypto investments because they are from mainland China, where holding, buying, and selling crypto is banned entirely.

&nbsp



Are the Hong Kong Crypto ETFs in Trouble?



Hong Kong is a global financial capital that attracts billions of dollars in investments. The country is governed by the One Country, Two Systems model. It was once part of the British Empire but was returned to China under an agreement. Hong Kong remained a free market despite being handed over to mainland China under the said agreement.



Asians, including Chinese, have a higher rate of crypto adoption than many other ethnicities. This is despite facing massive regulatory challenges in their home countries. China has banned crypto entirely, while countries like South Korea and Japan regulate it extensively. 



However, this hasn’t stopped tech-savvy investors from acquiring scarce digital assets, especially the top ones like Bitcoin and ETH. 



But why aren’t they interested in ETFs?



First of all, the Hong Kong crypto ETFs are still in their nascent stage, and it would be unwise to rule them out right now. Second, the listing of these ETFs has come at a time when the digital currency’s price index is quite stagnant overall, and no major price pump has occurred in several weeks, resulting in poor performance of ETFs overall, not just those listed on the Hong Kong exchanges.



Still, it is a cause of concern for these new ETF funds. They need to start doing better soon to be taken as a legitimate investment tool like their American counterparts.

Big Airdrop Will Finally Be Distributed On Wednesday: Here are the Expectations and Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Drift Protocol is preparing to distribute airdrops two days later, on May 16 at 15:00 Turkey time (UTC+3), according to the official blog post.
DRIFT was added to the listing roadmap by Coinbase today and can be listed on this exchange immediately after launch.


The introduction of the new token follows a three-month points program that has attracted traders, borrowers, lenders and airdrop farmers to Drift. The platform is considered one of the largest venues for continuous trading in Solana's DeFi ecosystem. However, protocol contributors have noted that most of the 100 million tokens initially allocated for this airdrop will be allocated to long-term Drift users.
12% of the airdrop, which corresponds to a total of 120 million tokens, will be distributed to eligible Drift users. Distribution will be made according to users' activities on the platform.






Holders of this token will have the power to vote on important decisions such as which tokens will be listed on the exchange or when the software will be updated. In the first wave airdrop, ten percent of DRIFT's total supply will be allocated to its users.
Venture supporters will receive a significant 22% share of DRIFT. A group of angel investors, including leading cryptocurrency venture capital firms Polychain Capital and Multicoin Capital and Solana founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, have invested over $25 million in the development of the protocol since 2021.


A significant 43% of the tokens will be directed towards “ecosystem development”, which could include trading rewards, liquidity incentives and future airdrops. Additionally, as stated on Drift's website, 25% of the tokens are reserved for “protocol development” payments to Drift contributors.

Will Ethereum Be Declared a Security By the SEC Next Week? - Decrypt

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may soon assert that Ethereum is a security in its expected rejections of several spot Ethereum ETF applications, a lawyer who specializes in digital assets warned Tuesday.The regulator is due to decide on VanEck’s application for such a product on May 23, followed by a final decision deadline for ARK Invest/21Shares’ application the next day. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale also have applications on the SEC’s desk.In March, the SEC put forth potential “grounds for [the] disapproval” of BlackRock’s application and Nasdaq’s proposal to list BlackRock’s product. One question the SEC posed in its notice is whether Nasdaq “properly filed its proposal” under the exchange’s rules for so-called Commodity-Based Trust Shares.Requiring that trusts hold a “specified commodity,” Scott Johnson, a general partner at Van Buren Capital, described the question’s inclusion as telling. “The obvious purpose is to potentially deny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they are holding a security,” he wrote on Twitter.Rather than indirectly excluding the digital asset as a commodity, the SEC could explicitly assert that Ethereum is a regulated security in its expected ETF denials. But that’s “highly unlikely,” Terrence Yang, a managing director at Swan Bitcoin told Decrypt.“Gensler and his team, they’re political animals,” he said, arguing that the political backdrop surrounding crypto has grown too tense for a move that would likely spark backlash from crypto-friendly politicians, including Former President Donald Trump.Following the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, hopes that spot Ethereum ETFs will get the same treatment have plummeted. On the blockchain-based prediction platform Polymarket, traders penciled in a pessimistic 16% chance that ETFs are approved this month, as of this writing.Even though SEC Chair Gary Gensler has publicly affirmed that Bitcoin is a commodity, the Wall-Street cop has been tight-lipped when it comes to Ethereum, refusing to answer questions about the cryptocurrency’s regulatory status as recently as March.Last month, a lawsuit filed by the Ethereum software company Consensys alleged that the SEC has internally viewed Ethereum as a security for over a year. Among other requests, the firm asked a federal judge in Texas to declare Ethereum is a commodity.Prior to its approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, the SEC denied similar applications for a decade, citing concerns of fraud and market manipulation in Bitcoin’s spot market. So-called surveillance agreements monitoring the Bitcoin futures market for ETFs that were already approved wouldn’t be sufficient, the SEC said.Eventually, a federal appellate court found that logic faulty, ordering the SEC to vacate its previous rejection of Grayscale’s application to convert its flagship trust into an ETF. Given the SEC approved Ethereum futures ETFs last October, Yang said a similar headache for the regulator could follow if it points to market manipulation again.“They can do it, but they should expect to get sued, and I think they'll get attacked politically through the heavy lobbying that the well-funded crypto industry has,” he said.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

SEC tries again for Debt Box suit dismissal with option to refile

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made another move in its attempt to have its case against cryptocurrency mining software firm Digital Licensing, doing business as Debt Box, dismissed. The agency filed a reply to its motion for the court to dismiss the case without prejudice, which would allow the agency to sue Debt Box again. The U.S. District Court for Utah Northern Division sanctioned the SEC for “gross abuse of power” and dismissed its first attempt to have the case dismissed without prejudice. It also ordered that Debt Box should receive reimbursement of legal fees. Debt Box asked the court not to dismiss the case without prejudice, calling the move a ploy to avoid permanent dismissal. The SEC reply in support of its motion to dismiss the Debt Box case without prejudice. Source: PACERThe SEC argued that the ability to refile an action was in the interests of Debt Box investors, and precedent showed that the court “normally should grant” a plaintiff’s request for dismissal without prejudice. It stated:“The SEC seeks dismissal without prejudice to allow the new team of attorneys assigned to the case to analyze the case file and take additional investigative steps before determining whether or not to proceed with a new complaint.” The SEC’s lead attorneys in the case resigned after the agency was sanctioned by the court. Related: US senators call SEC actions in Debt Box case ‘unconscionable’If a dismissal were granted without prejudice, Debt Box sought to impose 11 conditions on the SEC if it refiled a case. The SEC agreed in whole or in part to most of those conditions. One condition was the use of a Wells notice—a warning from the SEC that intends to bring charges—and the completion of investigation files. The SEC sought to limit the material it would provide with the notice. Source: paulgrewal.ethThe SEC opposed a condition requiring it to provide Debt Box with all material it subpoenaed in the case and to have a representative present at non-subpoenaed interviews in the investigation. Finally, it opposed a condition to produce potentially exculpatory information—information that would be favorable to the defendant—from its investigation. Debt Box is accused of defrauding investors of $50 million and selling unregistered securities in the form of licenses to use their software to mine digital assets. The SEC temporarily froze the company’s assets in August. This decision led to the agency being sanctioned when the court found that it had used a “false narrative” relating to the company’s purported plans to relocate outside the United States to justify it. The SEC expressed its “deep regrets” over that action. Magazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?

Crypto investment funds intake $130M, while filings reveal new spot BTC ETF purchasers

Cryptocurrency investment products saw inflows totaling $130 million in the week ending May 6, reversing a five-week streak of outflows, according to CoinShares. According to CoinShares’ “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly” report published on May 13, institutional investors increased their exposure to digital assets, with crypto investment products seeing total inflows of $130 million this past week.Once again, the lion’s share of movement was attributed to Bitcoin (BTC) investment funds, which received $144 million in inflows.Capital flows for crypto investment products.

Normally, you don't get these big fish institutions in the 13Fs for a year or so (when the ETF gets more liquidity), but as we've seen, these are no ordinary launches.”Balchunas believes this is a good sign for the market, adding, “Expect more, as institutions tend to move in herds.”The disclosure signifies a significant move by SWIB into the digital asset market by the Wisconsin Investment Committee. Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer investors exposure to Bitcoin without needing to own the cryptocurrency directly. This move by the Wisconsin Investment Committee could potentially signal a growing adoption of crypto investment products among traditional finance firms.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Insider at Solana's (SOL) Cypher Protocol Admits to Stealing $300K

Hoak's admission comes one day after Cypher's founder Barrett accused him of systematically draining troves of valuable cryptos from the protocol's redemption contract over multiple months, beginning in December. Citing on-chain data, Barrett said Hoak ultimately sent assets worth around $300,000 (at current market prices) to Binance, presumably to cash them out.

Filing suggests SEC is exploring grounds to deny spot Ether ETFs

Analysts have unearthed details from a March filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that suggest the regulator may consider labeling Ether (ETH) a security.In a May 13 X post, Davis Polk and Wardwell Associate Scott Johnsson reviewed a March 4 filing from BlackRock over its application to list and trade a spot Ether exchange-traded fund on the Nasdaq. The filing delayed the deadline for the commission to decide on a spot Ether ETF from BlackRock until June but also called for public feedback on whether the investment vehicle could be filed as a commodity.“The obvious purpose is to potentially deny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they are holding a security,” said Johnsson.Source: SECAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the SEC filing was “buried 50 feet deep in a pile of legalese,” but this did not change his speculation the regulator’s odds of signing off on a spot Ether ETF were “slim to none.” The SEC must decide whether to approve or deny VanEck’s spot Ether ETF by May 23 — the first in several applications waiting in the pipeline.Related: Traders rush to short Ether as Grayscale pulls its futures ETF planShould the SEC deny VanEck’s application, the commission could turn down spot Ether ETFs from ARK 21Shares, Hashdex, Invesco Galaxy, BlackRock and Fidelity. Grayscale withdrew its spot Ether ETF application on May 7 without explanation. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck reportedly doubted that the SEC would approve his company’s offering in May. Central to the SEC’s decision is whether the commission considers ETH a security or commodity. Despite many previous public statements from Chair Gary Gensler declaring ETH was not a security, reports suggest that the commission has launched a probe into Ether. Gensler will speak at the Investment Company Institute summit in Washington, D.C., on May 23.Magazine: SEC, Ripple case nears conclusion, Grayscale withdraws ETF filing, and more: Hodler’s Digest, May 5-11

Here Are The Meme Coins To Buy For Dogecoin-Like Gains If There Is A Repeat Of The 2021 Mania | Bitcoinist.com


								The return of Keith Gill (also known as “Roaring Kitty”), the man who largely contributed to the GameStop short squeeze in 2021, and the Dogecoin run, has led to talks about another imminent meme coin mania. If so, some meme coins are worth watching, as they could be the biggest beneficiaries of such development. 
Pepe (PEPE) And Dogwifhat (WIF) Could Lead The Way For Meme Coins
PEPE and WIF look set to lead the way if there is another meme coin mania due to Gill’s return. Gill was at the helm of the GameStop saga in 2021 when a group of Reddit traders staged a financial revolution against hedge fund managers who had been shorting the retail company’s stock. This led to GameStop’s stock rising from under $3 to $483 in under a month.

This event is believed to have paved the way for the meme coin frenzy, which began afterwards as many retail investors came into crypto following that event. This led to a parabolic rally in the prices of different meme coins, including the foremost ones, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. However, with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu looking to have lost most of their bullish momentum, newer meme coins like Pepe, WIF, and even Bonk could lead the way this time around. 
These newer meme coins have recorded significant gains in the last 24 hours since Gill made his first X (formerly Twitter) post announcing his return. Specifically, Pepe has been the largest gainer among the top-ranked meme coins, posting a price gain of over 25%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. WIF and BONK have also recorded price increases of 11% and 9%, respectively. 
Dogecoin and Shiba Inu also recorded significant price gains. However, in the long run, Pepe, WIF, and BONK are expected to outshine the two largest meme coins by market cap since they have more room to make parabolic moves to the upside. 
Meanwhile, Gill’s return can also be considered timely since meme coins were already projected to be one of the leading narratives for this bull run. As such, this can further ignite a notable surge in the meme coin market. 
The Event That Leads To Mainstream Adoption
Crypto expert Scott Melker predicted that mainstream crypto adoption would return when Dogecoin hits a new all-time high (ATH). However, Gill’s return could very well be the event that marks the return of retail investors into the crypto space. Moreover, what happened following his return makes a strong case for why crypto is the future of finance. 

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was reported to have halted the trading of GameStop’s stock due to its volatility following Gill’s numerous X posts. Such an occurrence is impossible on-chain, which could further convince traditional finance (TradFi) traders that using decentralized protocols is a better option. 
Unlike the NYSE, these decentralized exchanges didn’t halt trading despite the GameStop (GME) meme coin, which isn’t affiliated with the retail company, soaring by over 3000% in a single day.

Out of Danger? Bitcoin Price Could Soon Enter Parabolic Phase, Analyst Says | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin has recently recovered from a drop to a low under the $57,000 mark to now trade above the $62,000 mark, with one analyst suggesting BTC needs to remain above the $60,000 level to soon enter a parabolic phase.



According to popular cryptocurrency analyst Rekt Capital, who shared his thoughts on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) with their over 460,000 followers, Bitcoin’s price post-halving is officially out of the “danger zone,” and the cryptocurrency’s price celebrated with a good bounce from the Re-Accumulation Range Low support.”







The analyst, as reported, has revealed that Bitcoin’s price goes through three phases at each halving event, with the first phase being a pre-halving retrace that includes a price drop, which in this cycle was of over 23%, which is critical to set the stage for the next stage, the re-accumulation phase.



This phase, the analyst defends, establishes  the foundation for subsequent price movements. During this phase, Bitcoin’s price consolidates within a defined range, characterized by pullbacks and sideways movements—a reflection of normal range-bound behavior as the market tempers the preceding rally.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

While the re-accumulation phase can last months, it leads to the parabolic uptrend phase, in which Bitcoin’s price enters a period of accelerated growth.



Rekt Capital noted that this month and the next may be “unremarkable for Bitcoin,” but added that we’re “running out of unremarkable months” before BTC enters the parabolic phase.







As CryptoGlobe reported, Wall Street behemoth Susquehanna International Group, known for its vast trading volume across global financial products, has significantly increased its exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin, amassing a $1.2 billion position on it in Q1 2024.



According to a recent 13-HR filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Susquehanna International now holds a massive17,271,326 shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), valued at roughly $1.09 billion as of March 31, as well as 1,349,414 shares of Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), valued at approximately $83.74 million.

Lucky GameStop, AMC Traders ‘Turned Thousands into Millions’ - Decrypt

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsTraders who were fortunate enough to have bought in early on the latest meme stock craze are making away with huge gains. Unusual Whales, which tracks trading data, posted on Twitter the activity of one trader who invested $27,000 in call contracts on April 24 when they were priced at $0.21 a pop. The contracts then peaked at $13.63, meaning the investment would have reaped gains of 6,400%—turning $27,000 into $2 million, according to the firm. In another post, the data platform showed the trading movements of someone who exited after gains of 4,000% gains following a $32,000 buy-in of AMC Entertainment (AMC) stock options nine days before Roaring Kitty’s Twitter account sprang back to life on Sunday.Call contracts give buyers the right to buy a stock at a specified price and date—but not the obligation. It’s unclear how investors who held onto GME through the 2021 boom and bust have fared versus newcomers in the latest hype cycle. Unusual Whales did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.Meme stock mania returned to markets Monday after an internet figure who inspired the 2021 GameStop rally posted online for the first time in years. Over the past five days, GME stock is now up over 200%. Roaring Kitty (whose real name is Keith Gill) helped fuel the 2021 rally via Reddit posts and livestreams. On Sunday night, his first tweet in nearly three years inspired traders to snap up meme stocks and meme digital coins and tokens.Back in 2021, shares in dying companies like GameStop became popular on internet forums after amateur traders started pumping them. This led to chaos on Wall Street—and government intervention—after hedge funds that had shorted the stocks lost out after they suddenly went up in value. Cryptocurrencies experienced a boom at the time too, with meme coins and tokens in particular going up in value. They have since experienced a resurgence and some now make up the top digital assets by market cap. The virtual assets—which are based on Internet jokes and are usually extremely volatile—have this week shot up in value along with traditional stocks.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

                        A recent influx of investor disclosures has Bitwise, one of the United States’ leading Bitcoin ETF providers, “incredibly bullish” on BTC.The Top Institutional Bitcoin ETF Owners
In a recent memo, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan reviewed some of the newly uncovered Bitcoin ETF buyers, who have revealed their allocations as part of mandatory 13F filings with regulators in recent weeks.A 13F filing is a form required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of all investors with $100 million in assets under management, disclosing their entire ownership of publicly traded securities. Thousands of investors have now filed their Q1 2024 reports – the first reporting period during which Bitcoin spot ETFs have been live.“A lot of professional investors own bitcoin ETFs.” Hougan wrote, taking note of iconic asset managers like Hightower Advisors, which owns $68 million in the new funds. Another includes Bracebridge Capital, a Boston-based hedge fund holding a much larger $434 million in Bitcoin.Based on all filings submitted by May 9, a total of 563 professional investment firms were identified as having bought the ETFs, with allocations worth $3.5 billion in total. That doesn’t include those filing between then and May 15, such as the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB), which reported a $162 million allocation to Bitcoin on Tuesday.Why Bitwise Is Bullish On Bitcoin ETFs
According to Hougan, it’s very uncommon for ETFs to attract so many 13F filers in their first few months live. “From a breadth of ownership perspective, the bitcoin ETFs are a historic success,” he wrote.But that doesn’t mean Bitcoin ETF buyers have dried up already. Based on the data, it seems the vast majority of buyers until now have been retail-based, with professional investors only starting to dip their toes in.“Most professional investors take 6-12 months to evaluate crypto,” Hougan said, noting that allocations to crypto after one client meeting are “extremely rare.”Next, those investors usually make personal allocations to test the water, before making isolated allocations on behalf of their more pro-crypto clients later on.Finally, after about 6 months, those firms will start making “platform-wide allocations” with their whole client book, comprising 1% to 5% of their entire portfolio. For context, current allocations made by investors like HighTower comprise just 0.05% of their portfolios.“A 1% allocation of their portfolio to bitcoin would equate to $1.2 billion—all from a single firm,” Hougan wrote. “Multiply that by the growing number of professional investors participating in the space, and you can begin to see what’s behind my enthusiasm.”

MAGA Shiba Inu (MAGASHIB) to Skyrocket 13,000% Before MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

MAGA Shiba Inu (MAGASHIB) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



MAGA Shiba Inu (MAGASHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because MAGASHIB has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC – one of the largest exchanges in the world.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, MAGA Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and MAGA Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin.



MAGA Shiba Inu launched with over $7,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy MAGA Shiba Inu on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for MAGA Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 73mqxPkM9P59GeudJ2DT8i2v94QfLkfVVbfQnU2DTP5r – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MAGASHIB.

Ripple, the company holding the largest reserves of XRP, has sold 150 million tokens on May 13 in a $75 million sale that represents around 0.25% of XRP’s total market capitalization, currently around $28 billion.



The sale comes after Ripple released 1 billion XRP in the beginning of the month, with these tokens originally being locked in monthly escrows until 2027. Ripple allocated 200 million to its treasury account and placed the remaining 800 million in new escrows.



The sale was executed through Ripple’s treasury account, labeled “Ripple (1),” on the XRP Ledger explorer XRPScan, as first reported by Finbold, which transferred tokens to an unlabeled account, “rP4X2…sKxv3.”



This process effectively introduced new XRP into circulation, potentially adding inflationary pressure and adding to XRP’s annual inflation rate above the 4% mark. After Ripple’s release the destination account kept 50 million XRP and sent 100 million tokens to an address associated with its sales on the market.



If this pattern holds true, the additional 150 million XRP could create downward pressure on the price of XRP in the spot market. XRP is at the time of writing trading at $0.5 per token after dropping around 5% over the past week amid a wider cryptocurrency market correction.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

As CryptoGlobe reported  a cryptocurrency analyst has recently suggested the cryptocurrency’s price could be set for a significant upswing, pointing to  a symmetrical triangle on the cryptocurrency’s weekly chart, from which XRP could soon break out of.



The price of XRP has been trapped within this triangle for several years, reflecting a potential tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. A successful breakout, Carter said, would see XRP move upward significantly.



Should a breakout from the symmetrical triangle materialize, Carter projects an initial surge towards $0.93, a level XRP briefly touched in July 2023 following a positive development in the ongoing legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



However, Carter believes XRP will surpass this resistance level and reach a more ambitious mid-term target of $1.68, representing a staggering increase of over 200% from its current price level.

UK closes ‘trust me bro’ crypto firm that gave horrible advice to clients

United Kingdom authorities have officially shut down a crypto academy, claiming the founder used it to “recklessly persuade” people to partake in loss-making investment schemes, including an alleged $1.7 billion crypto “Ponzi.”According to the United Kingdom government agency The Insolvency Service, Amey Finance Academy offered advice to people looking to invest in various cryptocurrency schemes. However, some customers lost their entire investments based on misleading promises made by the firm’s sole director and shareholder.In WhatsApp messages seen by investigators, Amey allegedly told one customer that their investments were a “100 certy” and to “trust me bro.”Amey allegedly told another customer that their investment wouldn’t fall below 90% — but they ended up losing everything.“Desmond Amey used Amey Finance Academy to recklessly persuade individuals to invest in cryptocurrency schemes and mislead them about the risks of doing so,” said Mark George, chief investigator at the Insolvency Service. Source: Insolvency ServiceIt comes two weeks after the Insolvency Service secured a winding-up order against Amey’s firm in the U.K. High Court on April 30.One of the cryptocurrency schemes promoted by the firm was HyperFund — later known as HyperVerse — an alleged Ponzi scheme that went unchecked by Australian authorities for nearly two years.Two of the lead operators behind HyperVerse have since been charged by the United States securities regulator, which claims the firm ran a $1.7 billion fraud scheme.Related: OneCoin’s legal boss gets 4 years jail for massive $4B crypto scamHowever, Amey’s failure to provide up-to-date accounting records meant the Insolvency Service couldn’t establish the true relationship between Amey Finance Academy and HyperVerse. This lack of transparency left the Insolvency Service with no option but to seek a wind-up order, George explained.“The public deserve protection from companies trading in an opaque and objectionable manner which is why we applied to have Amey Finance Academy shut down.”About $6.3 million (5 million Great Britain pounds) passed through Amey Finance Academy’s bank account between October 2019 and March 2022, but the firm’s assets and liabilities weren’t able to be ascertained.Amey’s firm launched in December 2018, claiming to be “an established and successful independent consultancy providing a plethora of financial services.”Cointelegraph reached out to Desmond Amey for comment.Magazine: Ethereum’s ERC-20 design flaws are a crypto scammer’s best friend

Why Conviction of Tornado Cash Dev Has Sparked Outrage - DailyCoin


        

A Dutch court has found Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev guilty of money laundering.



Outrage has trailed the court decision.



The outrage comes as many worry about the precedent the ruling sets for crypto and technological development in general.




After nearly two years, the trial of Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev has come to a head.



The developer was charged with money laundering in the Netherlands in November 2022, as authorities sought to hold him responsible for criminal elements, including North Korean hackers, using the privacy protocol to launder stolen cryptocurrency worth billions of dollars. 




On Tuesday, May 14, a ruling was finally issued in the case, setting what many have described as a horrible precedent for the industry.



Pertsev Conviction Sparks Outrage 



On Tuesday, May 14, a Dutch court found Pertsev guilty of laundering $1.2 billion on Tornado Cash and sentenced the developer to 64 months or five years and four months in prison.



According to a translated summary of the ruling, the court found that the developer’s failure to implement controls to prevent abuse of the protocol, even after discovering that criminal elements were using it, made him responsible for the abuse. The ruling, however, has sparked outrage within the crypto community.



Former KPMG France Blockchain and Crypto Director Alexandre Stachtchenko asserted:




"This has gone too far. It is time to end this KYC and surveillance mess before it eats democracy itself."



Independent crypto journalist Lola L33tz described the ruling as “insane,” adding that it practically outlawed building any privacy service.







ConsenSys lawyer Bill Hughes described the ruling as “among the most chilling lines” crypto industry participants will ever read.



These views go beyond privacy concerns; many worry about the precedent it sets for crypto and technological development in general.



An Affront on The Freedom of Expression?



For many, the Tornado Cash case raises the question of whether developers should be held responsible for how their code is used.



“We don’t hold Microsoft responsible when drug gangs use Excel to keep track of their profits. 



We don’t arrest Apple executives when criminals plot crimes using FaceTime.  We don’t prosecute the NYSE because people can use it for insider trading,” Morrison Cohen Partner Jason Gottlieb stressed while explaining that code should not be illegal even though the abuse of it may be.



Gottlieb argued that code, like speech, was a form of expression protected by the First Amendment.



"We should not abuse fundamental rights to pursue even terrible criminals," he wrote.



Beyond the Pertsev case in the Netherlands, two other Tornado Cash developers, Roman Storm, and Roman Semenov, face similar money laundering charges in the U.S. The trial is set to begin on September 23.



While some experts have argued that the Netherlands case is not indicative of what could happen in the U.S., in 2023, a U.S. court rejected a Coinbase-backed effort to overturn the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) sanction on Tornado Cash. The judge found that the protocol and its DAO operated as a corporation as opposed to claims that it was just a piece of code.



On the Flipside 




Pertsev has 14 days to appeal his conviction.



Semenov remains at large.



Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has recently endorsed Railgun, a Tornado Cash alternative that implements “privacy pools” to make it difficult for bad actors to use the tool.




Why This Matters 



The conviction of Tornado Cash’s Alexey Pertsev sets a powerful precedent for crypto and technology development, raising questions about the extent to which developers can be blamed for how their software is used.

Here’s why US debt is out of control - and Japanese debt isn’t

On the face of it, the United States' debt to GDP ratio doesn’t seem that bad on a global scale. In 2023, it was lower than the average for G7 nations — at 123% — and roughly half of the most indebted country in the world, Japan, where debt stood at a whopping 255% of GDP in 2023.Looking at the numbers alone, it would be easy to brush this off as a non-issue. After all, Japan has managed to navigate its growing debt pile relatively well over the years. Its economy remains stable, while the Nikkei 225 index is up around 31% over the last year (as of May 10), outperforming the S&P 500. In reality, though, the economic situations in the two countries couldn’t be more different, which means that what works for Japan is unlikely to work for the U.S.The glaring difference between the two is the composition of their debt ownership. In Japan, nearly 90% of debt is owned domestically by its citizens and institutions. By contrast, roughly a quarter of U.S. debt is held by international debt buyers. And so needs to ensure that its debt remains attractive to them by paying a high enough yield versus its global competitors — especially as this debt rises to higher and higher percentages of GDP, meaning that it becomes riskier to lend to the government.Related: Jerome Powell’s pivot heralds a boring summer for BitcoinIndeed, last year Fitch Ratings already downgraded U.S. government debt from AAA to AA+. At the time, this news was brushed off by U.S. officials as “arbitrary and based on outdated data.” Later in the year, Moody’s downgraded its U.S. debt outlook to negative, which was also largely ignored by markets. But investors should be paying more attention because the U.S. won’t be able to sit back and let its debt soar to the levels seen in Japan. For one thing, Japan’s net debt is much lower than its gross debt-to-GDP ratio, meaning it holds more foreign assets than it owes to other countries — the exact opposite of the US. This makes it easier for Japan to manage its growing debt pile. Map of debt-to-GDP ratios around the world as of 2022. (Dark green signifies a higher ratio, while orange signifies a ratio of less than 25%.) Source: International Monetary FundJapan also hasn’t struggled with inflation nearly to the same extent as the United States. Its inflation rate sits at 2.7% after peaking at just 4.3% in January 2023. That's a far cry from the 9.1% the U.S. reached in June 2022. The Federal Reserve is still struggling to bring sticky inflation under control, which makes the soaring debt levels particularly dangerous as this can add fuel to the fire.The answer to inflation, as we all know, is restrictive monetary policy. But higher interest rates mean higher debt repayments, unhappy consumers, and — eventually — a slowing economy. Indeed, the Fed is already facing all of these problems. Consumer confidence is beginning to falter, debt repayments topped $1 trillion last year and first-quarter growth this year came in much lower than anyone anticipated. So much so that we’re now hearing whispers of stagflation — a particularly undesirable economic situation, where inflation continues to rise while economic growth stagnates. Here, higher debt also creates a problem, since it limits the government’s ability to use its fiscal powers to mitigate a slowing economy. So the Federal Reserve finds itself in a bit of a catch-22 situation, especially considering that it has all but promised a rate cut next.Related: The next ICO boom is coming — and it will be better than 2018In an election year, keeping interest rates high for too long could also spell an unhappy electorate. However, so far, both Democrat and Republican candidates appear to be entirely ignoring the elephant in the room that is the growing U.S. debt pile. Neither side has proposed any meaningful policies to address this issue. But, with the debt-to-GDP ratio now at well over 100% and projected to keep rising quickly over the coming decades, the government will have to face the music sooner or later. So what does this mean for crypto? Paradoxically, all this may be a net benefit for assets like Bitcoin, which could become a safe haven as worries over soaring U.S. debt intensify. Typically, rising debt levels also lead to currency devaluation. And while, like Japan, the U.S. may be able to avoid some of this due to the global reliance on the U.S. dollar, the high proportion of foreign debt ownership also makes the greenback particularly vulnerable. Coupled with the expectations of interest rate cuts later this year, there is little chance that the dollar will maintain its current strength for too long. This, of course, will be a boon for Bitcoin (BTC), which is widely seen as a hedge against dollar weakness. So this predicament the U.S. finds itself in isn’t necessarily bad news for cryptocurrency markets, depending on quite how badly out of hand things get. If the U.S. were to default on its debt, for example — which, of course, it won’t. This would be disastrous for all markets, including digital assets. A weaker dollar and some loss of confidence in the U.S., however, could be just what the doctor ordered for the next leg of the crypto rally.

Trader Predicts 1,660% Rally for Under-the-Radar Altcoin, Updates Outlook on Shiba Inu and Chainlink - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist believes that astronomical gains are on the horizon for an altcoin initially built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.
Analyst Ali Martinez tells his 62,100 followers on the social media platform X that the native asset of a supply-chain management project VeChain (VET) appears to be mirroring its previous cycle’s market structure.










If VET continues to follow the script, Martinez predicts that the altcoin will print staggering gains of more than 1,660% before the year expires.
“Fractals indicate that VeChain (VET) is set for a rebound this summer, with a potentially explosive growth in the fall.” 
Source: Ali Martinez/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that VET will rally to as high as $0.60 toward the end of 2024. At time of writing, VET is worth $0.0339.
Next up, Martinez says that memecoin Shiba Inu (SHIB) looks poised for a breakout rally.
“If Shiba Inu breaks the upper boundary of this descending parallel channel at $0.00002444, SHIB could witness a 20% upswing to $0.00002954!” 
Source: Ali Martinez/X
A descending parallel channel is typically a bearish structure indicating that an asset is in a downtrend. At time of writing, SHIB is worth $0.0000233.
The last altcoin on Martinez’s radar is the decentralized oracle network Chainlink (LINK). According to the trader, the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator has flipped bullish for LINK.
Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles.
Says Martinez,
“The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the Chainlink weekly chart, indicating that LINK could experience an upswing lasting one to four weeks.”

At time of writing, LINK is trading at $13.43.

More Pain For Ethereum? Analyst Predicts "Washout" To $2,700 Amid Regulatory Pressure


								Ethereum remains under immense selling pressure, shaving over 30% from March 2024 highs. With prices recently dropping below $3,000 and sellers doubling down, there could be no reprieve for optimistic buyers in the sessions to come. 
Analyst Expects One More “Washout” To $2,700
Taking to X, one analyst notes that the coin is still bearish and moving inside a falling wedge. The trader predicts that ETH will continue dropping below immediate support levels.

In a post, the trader predicts a potential “washout” for ETH that would likely see the coin fall below $2,700. The analyst added that despite the prevailing fear, the overall structure of Ethereum price action remains unchanged. 

The Ethereum candlestick arrangement in the daily chart shows that Ethereum prices are within a bearish breakout formation. Following the sharp losses in mid-April, buyers have yet to unwind losses.

Accordingly, unless there is no strong push above $3,300 and the descending wedge, the odds of sellers further pressing on remain high. In the current formation, Ethereum has strong support at $2,800. If there is a “washout,” as the analyst says, ETH may fall below $2,700 towards $2,600 and $2,200, two of the immediate support levels.
Prospects Of Spot Ethereum ETFs Dimming
 
Adding fuel to the bearish fire are growing odds that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might reject the approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this month. This speculation stems from analysts pointing to the commission potentially classifying Ethereum as a security, derailing ETF approval.
A finance lawyer on X confirmed that the United States SEC is considering classifying ETH as a security in their upcoming spot ETF decisions. Unlike Bitcoin, whose spot and futures ETFs were approved without such scrutiny, ETH faces this additional hurdle. 

Should the Gary Gensler-led commission deem ETH security, dire consequences would exist. While all spot ETF applications could be denied, there would be more. As part of Grayscale’s Ethereum trusts, ETHE, terms and conditions, if the United States SEC classifies ETH as a security, all ETHE will be liquidated, and the trust closed. 
In late April, Consensys, led by Ethereum’s co-founder Joseph Lubin, said they are suing the United States SEC to protect the broader crypto ecosystem. By threatening to classify ETH as a security, ConsenSys said the regulator “would jeopardize the United States’ ability to use Ethereum and similar blockchain technology.”

Solana Dev Confesses to Stealing, Gambling Away Cypher User Funds - Decrypt

Cypher protocol contributor “Hoak” confessed to stealing nearly half a million dollars in community funds to feed a growing gambling habit in a public statement on Twitter on Tuesday.“I know likely nothing I say or do will make things better—perhaps other than rotting in jail,” the pseudonymous developer wrote. “To address the elephant in the room, the allegations are true, I took the funds and gambled them away. I didn’t run away with it, nor did anyone else.”According to figures shared by Cypher Protocol core contributor “Barrett,” the stolen funds included $314,674 in USDT, USDC, and Solana (SOL) that were sent to Binance by a wallet associated with Hoak. In addition, the same wallet amassed over $184,077 in ETH, RLB, ORCA, RAY, USDT, USDC,  BONK, JitoSOL, mSOL, and WSOL.Hoak’s public confession appears to have been triggered by a simmering investigation that began on the Cypher Protocol Discord server. Cypher Protocol is a cross-margin decentralized exchange on the Solana blockchain.“First and foremost I would like to deeply apologize to all affected parties, I know at this point nothing is going to take back my actions, and I have to face the consequences, [and] I am also in no way, shape, or form attempting to victimize myself,” Hoak wrote. “But this is the culmination of what snowballed into a crippling gambling addiction and probably multiple other psychological factors that went by unchecked for too long.”In the confession, Hoak said the situation that led to the Cypher Protocol theft dates back to an unexplained event at the first Solana Breakpoint conference in November 2021.“The victims were my brother and Max from Mango DAO,” Hoak wrote. “Coincidentally, what someone else did to me and my brother was the same thing I ended up doing to Max.”The October 2022 Mango Markets hack allowed thieves to make off with $100 million in funds.According to Hoak, after an unnamed previous project failed to get off the ground, he began working with Cypher Protocol, which offers access to margined spot and derivatives markets and borrowing and lending services.“I’d found my footing with Cypher,” he recalled. “These guys became family to me, I loved them and the mission we had, I worked and worked, I tried to innovate within the DEX design space, I failed, I worked some more, and I broke.”Cypher Protocol core contributor Barrett subsequently posted details of the theft on Twitter, including Hoak’s wallet address, alleging that the theft happened via 36 withdrawal transactions over months.“This is incredibly saddening to me,” Barrett wrote. “I never thought this would be a possibility, having a core contributor who stayed on after the [Mango] exploit to try and rebuild the project be the one who rugged funds from the redemption contract.”As Barrett explained, the theft was first detected when a member of the Cypher Protocol Discord server reported that they were unable to withdraw funds, which Hoak said he would resolve. However, the user reported they could not withdraw after the deadline Hoak provided.“I have reached out to law enforcement with the information in the below document,” Barrett said, posting a link to a Google Docs document containing extensive details about the theft.Taking to Twitter, Internet Sleuth ZachXBT said he knew Hoak, adding that he helped the Cypher Protocol team with an exploit in 2023. As a result of that collaboration, ZachXBT said he had Hoak’s personal information.When Decrypt inquired about whether ZachXBT intended to share that information with law enforcement, he replied, “As needed yes.”“I currently have no energy left whatsoever and considering no one is going to want anything to do with me after all this, I believe there’s no way forward, and it’s actually over for me,” Hoak wrote. “Whatever comes next is in God’s hands.”“I’m sorry I fucked up,” his Twitter thread concluded.Hoak and Barrett did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin Echoes 2016 Trends, Predictions Suggest Surge to $350,000 in Current Cycle



                    

Bitcoin‘s trajectory is mirroring its post-2016 halving event, with current analyses suggesting a potential local bottom and future peaks reaching up to $350,000 in this cycle, as observed by cryptocurrency traders.



Rekt Capital, a pseudonymous crypto trader, noted in a May 11 post on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin’s pattern closely follows its 2016 behavior. 




“Bitcoin has repeated 2016 history perfectly, offering a downside wick below the bottom of its current re-accumulation range within a three-week window after the Halving,” Rekt Capital stated. 



At this stage in the cycle, the reaccumulation range is defined as any price under $61,081. Presently, Bitcoin’s trading price slightly lags this benchmark at $60,901, based on CoinMarketCap data.



Rekt also pointed out that Bitcoin is in the last “pre-halving retrace” phase, which in 2016 led to a significant 48% price increase six months later, reaching $973 by December 30.




Despite the current prices, Timothy Peterson, founder and investment manager at Cane Island Alternative Advisors, sees a promising outlook based on the price drawdown from the all-time high (ATH) chart. 



This chart tracks the decline from Bitcoin’s highest price point to its lowest within a certain period. 



Peterson stated, “Based on adoption and prior drawdowns, we can guesstimate that the peak value of this cycle would be between $175,000 – $350,000 in the next 9 months.” 



He anticipates the bull market concluding by January 2025.

Additionally, another indicator, the daily 100 moving average, is being closely watched by analysts. 



This average, which forecasts long-term Bitcoin price trends, is calculated by summing up the last 100 days’ prices and dividing by 100. 



According to Daan Crypto traders, this indicates that Bitcoin might be near its local bottom. 



In their May 11 post, they drew comparisons to a similar trend observed following the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January. 



A subsequent 32% price rise to $51,730 by February 25 supported their analysis.



Daan Crypto traders concluded with a cautious optimism: “Support until it isn’t, but bulls need to put in some work.” 



This sentiment underscores the dynamic and speculative nature of Bitcoin’s market movements, hinging on both historical patterns and evolving market conditions.

The rules stipulate that donations to the value of just over $200 “must only be made by bank transfer,” and would be subject to cross-checking.“All” crypto donations, even contributions worth less than $200, remain banned. The TSE first explicitly banned crypto as a donations tool in December 2019.It has subsequently updated its guidelines on several occasions. In each case, it has explicitly banned crypto donations.Crypto community members had been hoping for a change, considering the phenomenal rate of adoption in Brazil and the wider LATAM region.Regulator Orders Candidates to Abide by Rules
The TSE also instructed all candidates to detail their expenses and donated income in mandatory financial statements.The body warned that those who fail to adhere to its rules could face censure from the Public Prosecutor’s Office and its own court system.Last month, Nubank, the country’s biggest neobank and the third-largest company in Brazil by market cap, announced it would begin allowing its customers to make Bitcoin and Ethereum withdrawals from its banking app.

Roaring Kitty/meme stock-themed meme coins were the top crypto gainers today / Source: Cryptonews
                        Trading conditions were broadly bearish on Tuesday as traders focused on a hotter-than-expected US PPI report and commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with traders having to turn to the on-chain meme coin markets in the hunt for top crypto gainers today.Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) were both down around 2% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.Focus in the market has now mostly shifted to Wednesday’s release of US CPI and Retail Sales data.This could be a major market catalyst depending on how it impacts Fed rate cut bets.One reason why Bitcoin and Ether, last at $61,500 and $2,880 respectively, are down substantially from earlier yearly highs is that the US economy has remained hotter than expected this year.Traders will be hoping for evidence that the rise in price pressures seen in recent months is beginning to reverse.That could come as a relief to the market. But even if a bounce is incoming, major cryptos mostly remain tightly locked within recent ranges.Big moves are unlikely to come in anytime soon. The same can not be said for the highly illiquid on-chain crypto markets.Indeed, these markets were set alight this week by GameStop icon Roaring Kitty’s abrupt return.Meme coins in honour of the 2021 meme stock craze leader have been spring up left, right and center.Here are some top crypto gainers today as per Decentralized Exchange (DEX) analytics tool DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayRoaring Kitty Wif Hat (RWIF)A recently launched Solana meme coin called Roaring Kitty Wif Hat (RWIF), a combination of popular meme coin dogwifhat and Roaring Kitty, is ripping higher since its launch.As per DEXScreener, it was last up 95,000% in the past 24 hours. RWIF now has a market cap of $2.7 million.Little more than 12 hours old, RWIF has 1,300 holders and over 250 Telegram members.Before getting too excited, traders should remember that nearly all newly launched coins are scams or pump-and-dumps. Hardly any end up having any long-term value.DUMB MONEY (DUMB)Another just launched Solana meme coin called DUMB MONEY (DUMB) is also pumping.As per DEXScreener, it was last up 36,000% in 24 hours with a market cap nearing $900,000.DUMB MONEY is likely a play on the joke that the retail investors behind the meme stock/meme coin pump are considered “dumb money”, as opposed to “smart money” hedge funds or institutional investors.https://twitter.com/Dumb_Money_Sol/status/1790428817539895663But the meme stock craze of 2021 is widely hailed as an instance when Dumb Money won.DUMB has just over $100,000 in locked liquidity, but could easily just be a pump-and-dump scheme.GameStop (GME)BNB traders are getting in on the action, with just launched meme coin named GameStop (GME).That is, of course, borrowing its name directly from the legendary meme stock.Up 8,900% in 24 hours as per DEXScreener, GME’s market cap was last $4.4 million.The token has close to $1 million in unlocked liquidity, with over 1,500 unique wallets having traded it.Again, traders must do their own due diligence and keep in mind that most newly issued tokens are scams.Better Alternative to Consider
Investing on newly launched meme coins is fraught with risk.Yes, some of these coins might 100x. But the vast majority will fall flat, and investors might never be able to find the liquidity to sell.Their fast price action tends to trigger FOMO in traders, who neglect to do the required due diligence.A potentially better alternative to investing in just-launched meme coins is to invest in presales.Here, traders have more time to research a project and see if it is a good fit for them.Indeed, if a trader can reliably identify projects that end up gaining tract, they can make big gains.Analysts at Cryptonews keep a close eye on the presale market. Here are some of their top presales for 2024.20 Best Crypto Presales to Invest In Now

How Far Can Roaring Kitty’s Return Really Carry GameStop? - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsMeme stock fever is back, with GameStop, AMC, and other companies from the 2021 hype cycle seeing surging share prices in recent days amid the apparent return of Roaring Kitty, a key figure behind the 2021 craze. But with the trader and influencer primarily posting rousing movie clips so far, how long will the hype sustain a meme stock revival?Roaring Kitty is the alias of Keith Gill, a financial advisor turned content creator and stock trader who commanded attention when he made enthusiastic bets on the price of GameStop shares in early 2021. The video game retailer’s share price sank over the previous few years as the firm struggled to adapt to industry changes.His livestreams and bullish Reddit posts under the name DeepFuckingValue helped inspire many other everyday traders to buy into GME, pushing the price from around $5 to a high of nearly $500 per share. A resulting short squeeze led to billions of dollars’ worth of losses for firms that were betting against GameStop’s revival, and caused broader market chaos.Roaring Kitty disappeared from social media in June 2021, months after testifying before Congress on the matter. But his Sunday tweet, showing a man holding a controller and snapping to attention, helped rile up a revival in trading for GameStop, movie theater chain AMC, and other meme stocks, along with meme cryptocurrencies as well.At a closing price of $48.75, GME shares are up nearly 203% over the past five days, while AMC is up 117% during the same span to $6.85. That’s huge. But both stocks lost considerable ground over the course of Tuesday’s trading, amid questions of whether Roaring Kitty plans to do more than just tweet out video clips.GME opened the day just below $65 per share before dipping nearly 25% by the close, while AMC had a sharper 42% dip from the $11.88 start to the close.Both stocks are ticking up after hours, however, and we saw a sizable jump from the end of business on Monday to the markets opening on Tuesday. Could it repeat again? Anything’s possible with meme stocks, just like meme coins. They’re famously volatile and often based on social media sentiment.But it’s unclear how much Roaring Kitty plans to increase his online presence—and whatever his plans, can it really drive another large-scale meme stock revival? Roaring Kitty has yet to resume his livestreams and Reddit bull-posting from 2021; so far, it’s just been a steady stream of tweets featuring meme-ified movie and music video clips.That’s been enough to pump GameStop and AMC shares, along with various meme coins. But if that’s all we get from Roaring Kitty, will this revival ultimately be more than a blip on the radar—a short-lived blast of nostalgia? Traders eagerly await the answer.Editor’s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

OKX Ventures Invests in Blade of God X, Introducing 'Play to Train' AI Feature in Blockchain-Powered RPG



                    

OKX Ventures, a Crypto and Web3 investment fund, recently backed the action role-playing game Blade of God X, developed by Void Labs. 



The game, which is still in early access, introduces a novel “play to train” feature. 




This feature enables gamers to influence the training of an artificial intelligence (AI) model through their gameplay. 



In a press release, OKX Ventures described this innovative concept as a fusion of “advanced AI agents with blockchain technology,” allowing players to directly train their AI agents as they play the game.



However, specifics about the AI models and the exact mechanisms by which gameplay aids in their training remain vague. 




Inquiries made by Cointelegraph to OKX Ventures and Void Labs regarding these details have not yet been answered.



Blade of God X aligns itself with the “Souls-like” genre, recognized for its intricate action sequences, and is currently available for download on the Epic Game Store. 



While the game itself is free, engaging with its blockchain components may necessitate payments or wallet interactions. 



These blockchain features include functionalities that integrate with Immutable X and Ethereum Virtual Machine chains, as noted in the Epic Games Store’s FAQ section.

Players interested in the game’s Web3 aspects can utilize tools like MetaMask, GameStop, Venly, Coinbase Wallet, Magic Link, or Immutable Passport to trade and customize their gaming experience.



According to the press release, the Blade of God series has amassed over six million downloads to date, with Blade of God X itself securing $6 million in funding. 



The game’s partnership network includes notable investors such as Delphi Ventures, BreederDAO, and Eden Holdings among others.



Tnise, the founder of Void Labs, expressed gratitude for the support from OKX Ventures, noting, “This partnership will provide us with the necessary resources and guidance to continue innovating, broaden our horizons and deliver exceptional gaming experiences to players worldwide.”



Blade of God X represents a blending of traditional gaming with the emerging technologies of AI and blockchain, offering players both a rich gaming experience and an opportunity to partake in the development of AI through interactive gameplay.

Cypher core contributor admits to stealing $260K and gambling it away

An anonymous core contributor to the Solana exchange Cypher Protocol has confessed to stealing and gambling away around $260,000 worth of the project’s cryptocurrency recovered from a $1 million exploit last year.“The allegations are true, I took the funds and gambled them away. I didn’t run away with it, nor did anyone else,” the contributor, who goes by “hoak” wrote in a public statement they shared in a May 14 X post.Anonymous Cypher contributor “Barrett” had earlier posted a document to X alleging that a wallet owned by hoak made 36 transactions withdrawing various amounts of Ether (ETH), Bonk (BONK), Wrapped Solana (wSOL) and other cryptocurrencies from Cypher’s redemption contract — totaling around $260,000.“I never thought this would be a possibility, having a core contributor who stayed on after the exploit to try and rebuild the project be the one who rugged funds from the redemption contract,” Barrett wrote on X.They added they notified law enforcement of hoak’s alleged actions.Source: BarrettIn hoak’s statement, they wrote that “likely nothing I say or do will make things better — perhaps other than rotting in jail.”Hoak said their actions were “the culmination of what snowballed into a crippling gambling addiction” along with “multiple other psychological factors that went by unchecked for too long.”They said after a string of personal and career issues they found footing with Cypher but claimed they failed “to innovate within the DEX design space.”Source: Hoak“I worked and worked,” hoak wrote. “I failed, I worked some more and I broke.”Related: WBTC thief returns $71 million worth of stolen fundsHoak said they “let too many things pile up in my head for too long, I let them consume me.”“I completely lost it late last year and earlier this year to the point where simply trying to hold it together was impacting everything else in my life, distancing myself from long-time friends, family, not being able to meet the deadlines I set for myself, having erratic behaviours, you name it,” they wrote.In August 2023, an exploiter pilfered Cypher Protocol for — at the time — $1 million worth of Solana (SOL) and USD Coin (USDC).The protocol managed to freeze $600,000 worth of the stolen crypto, it later created the redemption contract and a recovery plan to pay back users for their stolen funds.

Bitcoin Price Linked To Binance Vs Coinbase Battle, Quant Reveals


																A quant has explained how there appears to be a relationship between Coinbase’s spot volume dominance vs. Binance’s and the Bitcoin price.
Bitcoin Has Been Reacting To Binance/Coinbase Volume Changes
In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the dynamics in the cryptocurrency market that arise out of the battle happening between Binance and Coinbase for spot volume dominance.

The quant shared a chart below that shows how this war for dominance has played out over the past decade.

As the graph shows, Binance has been the much more dominant of the two platforms when considering the spot volume. The exchange is hosting five times as much volume as Coinbase.
The analyst notes that the difference between the two would be even higher when considering the BTC-FDUSD pair, which isn’t included in the data depicted in the above chart.
Despite the much lower spot volume, Coinbase still hasn’t been irrelevant in the market. For example, the platform is the custodian for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like BlackRock’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC.
There also appears to be an interesting pattern between the dominance of the American exchange and the Bitcoin spot price. The quant has highlighted this trend in the graph.
There have been a few instances where a rise in the spot trading volume of Coinbase against Binance has preceded surges in the value of cryptocurrency. Similarly, declines in the platform’s dominance have seemingly led to drawdowns in the Bitcoin price.
The analyst has also discussed the trend in the volumes of the two exchanges more closely, using the spot volume ratio for them, as shown below.
The value of the metric seems to have been relatively low in recent months | Source: CryptoQuant
The chart shows that the spot volume ratio between Binance and Coinbase had spiked to very high levels in 2023, with the former’s volume being 53 times the latter’s. The reason behind this was the zero-fee scheme that Binance had introduced for the Bitcoin trading pairs.
However, Coinbase’s volume has recently risen, although the ratio remains notably in favor of Binance. This shift in the market emerged as the Bitcoin spot ETF-related news started to intensify.

The quant concludes:


The dynamics between these exchanges are complex, but the graphs show that each exchange’s dominance at specific times has a direct impact on the price of Bitcoin. It’s a true battle between the market’s biggest players, where competition is constant, and the outcome is reflected in cryptocurrency movements.


BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $61,800, down 3% over the past week.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Token Holder Swaps $23000 Into Mollars ICO - DCA’ing, King Shrimp Passed Whales


                        
                            Shiba Inu (SHIB) Token Holder Swaps $23000 Into Mollars ICO — DCA’ing, King Shrimp Passed Whales                        
                        

                         A crypto shrimp, perhaps better called the King shrimp, who was earlier tracked by Crypto.News has upped the holdings of his Mollars token presale ‘bag.’   Buying frequently or dollar cost averaging into the presale,  the traders frequent buys have made them what’s believed to be the biggest holder of Ethereum blockchain’s coming store-of-value token.The buyer’s wallet transaction address is public [see here] and was last active 11 days ago.Investor has a successful track record with Memecoins
The trader appears to be savvy in memecoin ICO investing as they have transactions with Shiba Inu (SHIB), Volt Inu (VOLT), and Robo Inu (ROBO).  The regular purchases of Mollars tops all other investments this year, but this holder is believed to be a major holder of Shiba Inu tokens.    Possibly a holder from the SHIB token’s golden era.Investments in the Mollars token presale would not have caught the eye of anyone watching the presale’s transaction addresses.   The biggest single purchase by this ‘King Shrimp’ was for 1.06 ETH, which is far from the biggest single buy from an investor.  However,  when making 12 purchases of such a magnitude,  the numbers add up quickly.DCA: Made 12 Mollars Token Presale PurchasesThe total value of the 12 purchases, in Ethereum coin, is 7.974272038 ETH.  The purchase has a value of roughly $23080.73 at the time of writing this article.The amount of Mollars tokens purchased with this $23K investment is estimated to be around 57,700.  Investments are believed to be made between 1st and 3rd round of the ICO, averaging around $0.40 [cents] per token.Mollars token is already slated to be listed on at least 2 crypto exchanges on or around June 1st — Bitmart and LBank.  If the Initial Coin Offering reaches its max hard cap, the listing day price of the token will be $0.62 [cents] per token.How Listing Day Could Yield Investor $12.6k Profit
The listing day of 62-cents means this ‘King Shrimp’ will see their investment rise in value from $23,080.70 to $35,775.09 on June 2nd,  if hard cap’s met.The value of the token is projected to continue to rise from there however, with some token predictions suggesting the $MOLLARS token could reach ~$15 [dollars] before the year’s end; higher possible if popularity continues growing at a similar pace as today, after listing day.The “King Shrimp” appears to have made a valuable decision with a $12695 profit close to materializing.The hard cap of the Mollars ICO is 4-million tokens.  The total token supply of the cryptocurrency, ever to be minted, is 10-million tokens.   Just 40% of the total token supply for the cryptocurrency was designated for the presale, from which much will be used to fund the project’s development and critical growth in branding value.Investor Choosing SHIB Signals Higher Expectations For MollarsThe “King Shrimp” appears to be migrating a sizable amount of his funds from Shiba Inu to Mollars.  This is  possibly a signal that the veteran investor believes the $MOLLARS token will see a substantially higher growth than $SHIB in 2024.Mollars token presale has raised $1.31-million-dollars in funding thus far.   This holder with $23,000 is believed to be the biggest holder of the new store-of-value token pre-listing.For the year, Shiba Inu token has yielded investors a +168% gain but most holders are still under water [losing] in 2024.The last months’ gains were only +6.6%, which  is less than the expected listing day yields for Mollars.   Migratory traders see the writing on the wall for the new store-of-value token, set to rival Bitcoin;  It’s likely going to produce far more gains than Shiba Inu (SHIB) any time soon.

Bitcoin will stay in $55K to $75K zone for now: Novogratz

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price will continue to range between $55,000 and $75,000 over the next month, potentially bouncing higher toward the end of Q2, according to Mike Novogratz, the founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital. Speaking on Galaxy Digital’s Q1 earnings call, during which the firm reported record quarterly revenue, Novogratz said crypto markets are currently in a “consolidation phase” and predicted that prices will bounce higher towards the end of the current quarter. “Bitcoin, Ethereum, and everything else, Solana will consolidate. What does that mean? It means probably somewhere between 55 and 75 until the next set of circumstances, the next set of market events brings us higher,” he said. Spot Bitcoin ETFs initially debuted with ravenous demand from institutional investors — generating more than $13.9 billion in volume in their first work — but inflows have waned significantly in recent months amid a wider tumble in price for the underlying asset.According to TradingView data, Bitcoin is down 16.5% from its new all-time high of $73,700, which it notched on March 13. Bitcoin remains up 45.7% from the start of the year. Source: TradingViewNovogratz said he wasn’t too worried by the dwindling inflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs nor did he seem concerned by Bitcoin’s recent downward slide, noting a broader trend of adoption among traditional financial institutions. Galaxy Digital and pattern firm Invesco, issue their own spot Bitcoin ETF which sports the ticker BTCO. Since inception, the fund has attracted just $268 million in inflows — the second lowest total inflows of all funds excluding Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. “We continue to see adoption growing [...] big players are just now starting to put it through their system,” he said. “That whole process of wealth managers selling it to their clients isn’t an overnight process.”Related: Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital raising $100M to fund crypto startups: ReportNotably, Novogratz said many of the tailwinds that drove price action at the start of this year will continue to stick around for the next few months and looked to several catalysts for crypto market price action moving forward. He said crypto asset prices could begin to pick up when the United States Federal Reserve eventually begins cutting rates “because the economy finally slows” or alternatively we see a favorable outcome from the upcoming U.S. presidential election.“We get through the election and I think the election will bring clarity, one way or the other, to the crypto regulatory landscape,” Novogratz said. Galaxy Digital posted a net income of $421.7 million for the first quarter, climbing 40% from the last quarter of 2023. Income was buoyed by record revenue from mining operations and management fees.Web3 Gamer: Web3 gaming won’t exist in 5 years, $656K for best crypto game pitch

Wisconsin Invests $99 Million in BlackRock Bitcoin ETF


The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) has made a significant move in the cryptocurrency market by purchasing $99 million worth of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). 
This acquisition, disclosed in a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), highlights the growing trend of institutional investment in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Wisconsin’s Strategic Move
The financial markets have been buzzing since spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January. These investment vehicles have quickly gained traction among institutional investors. For instance, notable financial entities such as Wells Fargo and JPMorgan have already disclosed their holdings in Bitcoin ETFs.

SWIB, responsible for managing assets within various state trust funds, including the Wisconsin Retirement System and the State Investment Fund, now has strategically positioned itself in the growing ETF market. By investing nearly $100 million in BlackRock’s offering, Wisconsin joins a growing list of institutional investors betting on the future of crypto.

“Normally you don’t get these big fish institutions in the 13Fs for a year or so (when the ETF gets more liquidity) but as we’ve seen these are no ordinary launches. Good sign, expect more, as institutions tend to move in herds,” Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said.


The investments towards these new financial vehicles show no signs of slowing down. Over the last 24 hours, nearly $66 million in net inflows were recorded, bringing the total inflows to almost $11.75 billion. Among the notable gainers were FBTC, which received $39 million in inflows; BITB, which received $20 million; and HODL, which received $7 million.

Other financial giants have similarly ramped up their investments. Bracebridge Capital has invested $363 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs, while Bank of Montreal has also disclosed owning Bitcoin ETFs in a recent SEC filing. Additionally, UBS Group AG, a Switzerland-based investment bank, invested $145,692 in IBIT.
The influx of institutional investments into its ETFs signifies a pivotal shift in the financial sector. It points to a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class, paving the way for broader adoption and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance.

Why Floki Inu Wants to Burn 15.2 Billion Tokens


The Floki Inu community proposed to burn 15,246,000,000 FLOKI, which are currently worth $2.8 million.
The community explained that these actions intend to remove the tokens from blacklisted wallets.
15.2 Billion FLOKI Burn
Floki Inu detailed that the burning of 15,246,000,000 FLOKI is supported by a 2022 vote, where the community agreed to burn the excess recovered tokens. The community has emphasized that when wallets are blacklisted, nothing can be done with the tokens apart from sending them to the Floki multisig. 
In other words, the community sees it as right to remove these tokens from the market permanently.


“As such, we feel it is only fair to burn the returned token to permanently remove it from circulation, in line with the expectations the community has about these tokens,” Floki Inu community explained.

Floki DAO even promised those who voted to send 1% of the value of the returned tokens, around 154 million FLOKI, to those affected as a “goodwill gesture.” This could encourage more wallets to send their excess tokens to burn. Regardless, the proposal has received 232 votes. 
It is not the first time the community has voted to burn FLOKI tokens. In February, they voted to burn 190.9 billion tokens recovered from the multi-chain bridge.

“In each of these cases, the decision of the Floki DAO was swiftly executed, making it clear that Floki is a completely decentralized cryptocurrency and the Floki DAO ultimately determines the direction of the project,” the Floki Inu community said.

Following the announcement, FLOKI rose more than 11%, going from $0.0001872 to $0.0002025. Meanwhile, its trading volume rose 235.29% in the last 24 hours.

Investors Buy $4.2 Billion in Bitcoin Before US Inflation Data


In anticipation of the upcoming US inflation report, savvy investors have purchased 70,000 Bitcoin (BTC), signaling a strategic pivot towards cryptocurrency as a hedge against potential economic volatility. 
This massive acquisition follows a significant 1 million BTC sell-off at the close of 2023, underscoring renewed confidence among long-term holders in BTC’s value.
Investors Return to Buy 70,000 BTC Ahead of CPI Report 
Recent worries about inflation and the decreasing worth of fiat currencies have sparked renewed interest in alternative stores of value. 
Indeed, on-chain data from Glassnode reveals investors are strategically accumulating more Bitcoin. Their actions suggest a belief in BTC’s enduring value, particularly as it stabilizes above $60,000.

The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.4% in March and reached 3.5% over the past year. This number remains historically high and has significantly changed the value of a dollar compared to a decade ago when the inflation rate was just 0.8%. 
The upcoming US inflation report on May 15 also has investors on edge as the Federal Reserve remains unlikely to cut rates this year. For this reason, Neil Bergquist, CEO of Coinme, emphasizes Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value. 
He points out that, unlike bank-held dollars, Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million BTC presents an inflation-resistant alternative. 


“There’ll never be more than 21 million bitcoin ever. It has a fixed supply, unlike fiat currencies, and no one can change that. No one can come in with a new policy, no one can get elected with a new idea and change that. It’s hard-coded into the bitcoin blockchain,” Bergquist explained.

Core inflation, which excludes the more volatile costs of food and gas, will likely remain persistently high due to increased costs of shelter and core services such as insurance and medical care. According to Bank of America, higher energy prices, driven by increased gas prices, are expected to contribute to a “relatively firmer headline CPI print.”
As a result, Bitcoin may be able to establish itself as a decentralized resource, solidifying its standing as a hedge to traditional financial systems. 

“If you hold dollars in your bank account over a period of rising inflation, then your balance has less purchasing power than if you were to store your value in Bitcoin,” Bergquist concluded.

Bitcoin miners start to sell: Will BTC crash again, sooner than you think? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin miners might sell as decreased mining rewards and transaction fees lower revenues.
A potential sell-off by miners could dramatically impact the cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin [BTC] continues to hold significant value, trading above $60,000 despite a 2.3% decrease over the past day. 
This resilience in price comes amid a challenging period for Bitcoin miners, whose revenues have plummeted following the most recent halving event, according to data from Kaiko.
Pressures on Bitcoin miners intensify
Bitcoin miners are facing increasing pressure to sell their holdings as a result of diminishing revenues.
 The recent halving, which reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, has significantly impacted their income. 
This drop in revenue is compounded by falling transaction fees, which have not recovered since the initial surge following the halving.
Source: Kaiko
Kaiko’s report highlights that miners’ dual income streams—mining rewards and transaction fees—are yielding lower returns. 
This is forcing miners to consider offloading their BTC to cover operational costs. Kaiko analysts noted, 
“The halving has typically been a selling event for Bitcoin miners as the process of creating new blocks incurs significant costs, forcing miners to sell to cover costs.”
Source: Kaiko
The potential for a Bitcoin sell-off by miners could have profound effects on the cryptocurrency market, especially given the current low liquidity. 
Mining giants like Marathon Digital, which holds over $1.1 billion in Bitcoin, could trigger significant market movements if they decide to sell even a small portion of their holdings.
Kaiko’s report explains.
“Bitcoin miners typically classify their BTC holdings as current assets due to their ability to liquidate these holdings to fund operating expenses.”
 With major players like Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin, any forced sales could lead to notable market impacts.
Bitcoin’s network activity declines
Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s network activity is showing signs of slowing down. 
Glassnode’s data reveals that the number of active Bitcoin addresses (7d EMA)  has fallen from over 800,000 to below 700,000 in recent weeks. 
Source: Glassnode
Similarly, the number of new addresses (7d EMA) has decreased from around 388,158 to 267,925, indicating a possible decline in user engagement and interest.
Source: Glassnode
Short-term technical analysis suggested that Bitcoin took out liquidity on the 30-minute chart on the 14th of May. 
This suggested that the asset might continue to retract towards the $60,000 range—a swing low—before any significant upward movement occurs.

The potential decline, coupled with pressures on miners, could set the stage for a volatile period in the Bitcoin market.

Meanwhile, AMBCrytpo has recently reported that crypto analyst Ali Martinez has projected that if Bitcoin can reclaim $64,290 as a support level, there could be a pathway to a bullish rise toward $76,610.

The NTS and its regional affiliates have been cracking down on tax dodgers who use crypto investments to hide their income in recent years.These crackdowns have yielded great success for the NTS and local tax bodies. They have seized and forcibly liquidated coins belonging to thousands of crypto holders nationwide.The NTS showcased its results over the past five years, explaining it had enacted “forced collections” for “641 high-value and habitual delinquents.”A National Tax Service office in Seoul.The tax body said that, as of 2021, it had frozen over $79 million worth of coins from tax dodgers.These tax dodgers have since paid the NTS over $69 million in fines and outstanding tax bills to unfreeze their tokens.The NTS said that it has “directly” sold $800,000 worth of coins from people who failed to pay their fines and outstanding bills.That would suggest that the tax body is currently holding coins worth over $9 million. Should tax evaders fail to pay their bills, the NTS would likely liquidate the entire $9 million.Yang Dong-hoon, the head of the NTS’ Tax Collection and Legal Department, said:“The National Tax Service will achieve tax justice. We will do so by tracking the assets of high-value and habitual tax delinquents. Right to the very end.”Tax Dodgers ‘Living Lives of Luxury’
The NTS also gave details about the other types of assets it had seized, and in some instances, sold off.These included valuable works of art, as well as undeclared inheritances. The haul also included luxury cars and prepaid golf course memberships.The tax body said that in many cases, tax delinquents were “living lives of luxury” in “expensive houses.”In March, tax authorities in the city of Hwaseong said they had confiscated crypto worth over $768,500 from tax offenders.This figure involved a confiscation worth around $567,000 from a single individual.

UK Crypto Firm Shut Down After £5M Losses In Investors Money


								The UK government’s Insolvency Service has shut down a crypto advisory firm for accounting negligence and the loss of investors’ money. The firm seemingly claimed to help users with investments while promoting crypto schemes that resulted in millions lost.

False Crypto Expert Company Shut Down
On Monday, The UK’s government published a press release unveiling a web of lies weaved by Amey Finance Academy Ltd. Amey Finance was “an established and successful independent consultancy providing a plethora of financial services.”
The crypto advice company claimed to run an “industry-leading education academy” that guides customers through investment opportunities and teaches them about crypto.
Instead, the company promoted scheme projects, resulting in the loss of investors’ money. On April 30, the UK’s Insolvency Services obtained a winding-up order from the High Court in London.
In 2018, Desmond Amey created Amey Finance Academy to “offer financial advice and education on cryptocurrencies.” Amey was the London-based company’s sole director and shareholder and considered himself a “wealth creation expert.”
The director assured customers that their crypto investments “were solid.” However, investors informed authorities that they lost money in the opportunities offered by the firm.
Despite claiming to have the required licensing from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), it was revealed that the company was operating without authorization. In 2022, the FCA informed investors that Amey Finance Academy offered financial services and products as an unregistered company.
According to Mark George, the Insolvency Service’s Chief Investigator, Amey used the company “to recklessly persuade individuals to invest in cryptocurrency schemes and mislead them about the risks of doing so.”
The Chief Investigator revealed that the firm failed to deliver up-to-date accounts during the investigation. As a result, the Insolvency Services couldn’t establish the full extent of Amey Finance’s activities.
Despite the lack of transparency, the agency determined that at least £5 million passed through the company’s bank accounts between 2019 and 2022:

The failure to deliver adequate accounting records and a general lack of transparency shown has prevented the Insolvency Service from establishing the true extent of the company’s activities, its assets and liabilities, or the use of £5 million which passed through the company’s bank account between October 2019 and March 2022.

‘Trust Me Bro’ Director Promotes Schemes
According to the press release, Amey misrepresented the investment opportunities he offered. He assured customers their investments would not “drop below 90%” before losing all their money.
The investigation revealed that Amey Finance promoted crypto schemes run by other companies. Among these schemes, the firm endorsed companies like HyperFund, which raised $1.7 billion worldwide.
HyperFund raised the alarm of regulatory entities in the UK and New Zealand, who issued customer warnings against the company. The US Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the company, ultimately charging its founder with fraud in January 2024.
The director’s contradictory statements prevent Insolvency Services from unveiling the true relationship between Amey Finance and HyperFund. However, Amey claimed he only used his firm’s bank account to “help people buy cryptocurrency via a separate company called Bleuguava.”
During the investigation, the Insolvency Services had access to some messages from the director. Amey had told customers that the crypto investments were “100 certy” and asked investors to “trust me bro.”
Further investigations showed that the director’s email signature stated he was the Managing Director of Amey Commercial Finance Ltd, a company dissolved in 2017. In 2023, he had been evicted from the company’s address in London despite claiming to still have a presence there.
Ultimately, Amey’s web of lies resulted in the loss of millions for the investors and his company’s shutdown and future liquidation.

Layer-3 network Degen Chain hasn’t produced a block in 53 hours

Ethereum layer 3 blockchain Degen Chain has failed to validate a transaction or produce a new block in over 53 hours rendering the network and its applications completely unusable. Degen Chain stalled at 8:15 pm UTC on May 12 — the last time the network produced a new block, according to its block explorer.It is one of a few layer 3 blockchains that settle transactions on a layer-2 network. It uses the Ethereum layer 2 chain Base for settlement and the AnyTrust protocol for data availability functions.Degen Chain hasn’t produced a new block in over 50 hours. Source: Degen ChainIn a May 14 X post, the official Degen Chain account said it was working to resolve the downtime alongside its development partner — rollup infrastructure platform Conduit. Conduit said the downtime could be traced back to an issue stemming from a “custom config change” that saw Degen Chain and gaming network Apex stop block production. Source: Degen ChainIt added nodes for Degen Chain are resynchronizing from its genesis block, the first block on the network.“We’re working with both teams and Offchain Labs to restore service and minimize impact to users,” Conduit wrote on X.Degen Chain said current estimates see the network resuming functionality sometime after the “resync” is conducted, currently slated for 1:00 pm UTC on May 15 (6:00 am PST on May 15).Degen Chain — originally developed for its native memecoin Degen (DEGEN) — also hosts a range of decentralized applications including DegenSwap, Mint Club and bridging service Relay bridge, all currently inoperable during the blockchain’s downtime. The network’s native DEGEN token has fallen 24% from its seven-day top of $0.02 on May 13 to $0.015, per CoinGecko data. DEGEN’s seven-day chart shows a price drop since Degen Chain’s block stall.

Shiba Inu’s Adoption Soars: Meme Coin Now Accepted at Major Retailers with CoinGate Integration | Cryptoglobe


                                
The popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has recently taken a new step towards broader adoption after its integration with CoinGate, a Lithuanian blockchain payment processor, added support for it on Polygon and the BNB Chain.



According to a post from CoinGate on social media, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency can now be used as a payment method at major retailers including Steam, Nike, Spotify, and Airbnb.







CoinGate acts as a bridge between the cryptocurrency world and traditional finance. By integrating SHIB with Polygon and BNB Chain, CoinGate facilitates transactions using SHIB for everyday purchases.



The news comes at a time in which the price of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency has been surging, with SHIB moving up over 10.5% over the last 30 days and more than 120% year-to-date.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Notably, earlier this month a major anonymous Shiba Inu whale wallet executed a series of large transactions on the popular Robinhood exchange, accumulating a staggering 1.75 trillion $SHIB tokens, valued at roughly $40 million.



The whale’s accumulation was first spotted by whale monitoring service Whale Alert, which pointed on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to two massive SHIB transactions off of Robinhood’s wallets to unknown wallets. Both transactions were of 875 billion SHIB, worth nearly $20 million.



This whale activity coincides with a potential bullish signal for SHIB. According to a recent post by Ali Martinez, a prominent cryptocurrency trader, Shiba Inu’s daily chart appears to be forming a “bull flag,” a technical indicator suggesting an imminent price surge.







Anticipating this breakout, Martinez revealed plans to place buy orders around the $0.000018343 mark, aiming to capitalize on a potential rise in SHIB’s price.

Is The Crypto Market Headed For A $100 Trillion Boom? This Expert Thinks So


								Raoul Pal, a well-known figure in the financial sector, provided a striking forecast for the future of cryptocurrencies.
His analysis suggests a potential rise in the market’s total capitalization to $100 trillion, spurred by global liquidity trends and technological adoption.
The Mechanics Behind The Prediction
Pal’s insights are rooted in his observation of the global liquidity cycle, which has been shaping macroeconomic trends since 2008. He notes that this cycle has played a crucial role in driving asset growth, particularly in the technology and crypto sectors.

In addition, Pal noted that the depreciation of fiat currencies, necessitated by the need to service growing global debt, is pushing asset prices higher.
This, combined with the rapid adoption rate of cryptocurrencies—reminiscent of the internet’s exponential growth—sets the stage for a monumental increase in market capitalization.

Pal’s view is supported by Chris Burniske, the former head of cryptocurrencies at ARK Invest, who concurs with the bullish outlook. Burniske envisions the digital currency market reaching $10 trillion soon and potentially soaring to $100 trillion.
Broader Crypto Market Perspectives
This optimistic forecast is not isolated. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, also projected significant growth for the crypto market, predicting it could reach $5 trillion by the end of 2024.
Garlinghouse’s comments, made in interviews with CNBC and Fox, emphasize the influence of macroeconomic factors like spot ETFs in attracting institutional money into the market. He suggested that decreasing supply and increasing demand could even mean his prediction might be conservative.
Further supporting the bullish sentiment, Bernstein, a financial services firm, issued an “outperform” rating on Robinhood, anticipating a near tripling of its cryptocurrency revenue by 2025.
In doing that. Bernstein’s analysis predicts the total market value of cryptocurrencies could hit $7.5 trillion by 2025, driven by a massive market expansion.
Despite these optimistic projections, the cryptocurrency market currently stands at $2.36 trillion, experiencing a slight downturn of 1.5% over the past 24 hours.

This decline is mirrored in the performances of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which saw reductions of 1.8% and 2.1%, respectively.
Notably, Dan Tapiero, the cofounder of Gold Bullion International and 10T Holdings, has recently expressed an extremely positive outlook on Bitcoin’s future based on current chart patterns.

In a recent tweet, Tapiero highlighted two charts that indicate a very promising trend for Bitcoin. He predicts that the leading crypto will soon surpass the $65,000 mark, followed by a climb to $90,000, with the potential for even further gains.

Signs of an altcoin season - Why we aren't in one yet? - AMBCrypto



Altcoins have performed well in a six-month window, but it does not signal an altcoin season.
The Bitcoin dominance chart could see accelerated gains for altcoin market capitalization.

Bitcoin [BTC] could not shake off its halving blues even though nearly a month had elapsed since the event. Market participants eagerly await a bull run, for both BTC and altcoins.
The altcoin season started in September 2023 and saw a pullback in the past six weeks.
There is plenty more in store for altcoins, but they have already witnessed a decent return in that six-month window. How crazy could the altcoin season get once Bitcoin is well on its way to this cycle’s top?
Replicating the past cycle’s performance
Source: TOTAL3 on TradingView
During the 2020 cycle, the altcoin market capitalization went from $51.2 billion in May 2020 to $1.13 trillion in November 2021.
This was a 21.6x gain, and a similar result during this cycle could put the market cap at $6 trillion.
That sounds like a mind-blowing number compared to $640 billion at press time, but crypto cycles do have a way of ripping up expectations.
Even though altcoins have performed well in recent months, they have competed with Bitcoin for a share of the capital inflows.
This could change once investors are willing to embrace more risk, confident of extended crypto gains, and look to expand their altcoin holdings.
Bitcoin dominance might hold the key
Source: BTC.D on TradingView
The altcoin winds might become dramatically more bullish once the Bitcoin dominance begins to shed. This chart maps what percentage of the total crypto market capitalization Bitcoin has captured.
Once it begins an earnest downtrend, it would indicate participants were more eager to buy altcoins than Bitcoin.
In the past 13 months, Bitcoin’s dominance has slowly climbed higher. This is typical of bear markets and persists till late into the bull run.
The few months when this metric is in a free fall is when the altcoin season truly begins.

Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025

Comparing the altcoin market cap chart with the BTC.D chart, we can see that the greatest altcoin gains were made once Bitcoin dominance was in a downtrend.
Therefore, market participants waiting for an altcoin season this cycle could watch out for a fall in Bitcoin’s dominance.

Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s clients also recently invested $731,246 in spot Bitcoin ETFs, as revealed on the 14th of May.
Additionally, U.S. banking giant Wells Fargo entered the fray, holding 2,245 shares of GBTC valued at $121,207, and the list goes on.

Furthermore, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has reached a significant milestone, surpassing its competitors in corporate holder count.
Since its inception till date, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has attracted 250 corporate holders.
Amidst the burgeoning investor interest, discussions have been widespread within the cryptocurrency community.

According to the on-chain metric analysis The Block, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust saw $171.1 million outflows last week, contrasting with $63 million inflows on the 3rd of May.
Fidelity’s FBTC led with $111.3 million inflows, followed by ARKB with $82.8 million. BlackRock’s IBIT had $48.1 million in inflows, marking a slowdown from peak inflows in March.
Hold your horses 
However, amidst such massive inflows, strangely Hong Kong ETFs experienced significant outflows on the 13th of May.
Data from Farside Investors indicates that spot bitcoin ETFs offered by ChinaAMC, Harvest Global, Bosera, and Hashkey collectively saw outflows totaling $32.7 million.

Additionally, despite a reversal in flows, trading volume for U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs declined to $7.4 billion last week, compared to the previous week’s $11 billion, as reported by The Block’s data dashboard.

This decrease in volume was also reflected in the global crypto exchange-traded product market, which fell to $8 billion from an April weekly average of $17 billion.
Lastly, daily trading volume notably declined after hitting a record high of $9.9 billion on March 5, coinciding with bitcoin’s surge past its previous cycle peak of around $69,000.
Thus, as things evolve, the question remains unanswered — Could the increased institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs reshape how people enter Bitcoin?

Ethereum Price Anticipates Upside Break To Shift Sentiment Towards Bullish


																Ethereum price is eyeing an upside break above the $2,900 level. ETH must settle above $2,900 and $2,940 to continue higher in the near term.

Ethereum is forming a base above the $2,860 support zone.
The price is trading below $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,905 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).
The pair could start a decent increase if there is a close above the $2,940 and $2,950 resistance levels.

Ethereum Price Eyes Fresh Increase
Ethereum price struggled to settle above the $3,000 level and started another decline, like Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $2,950 and $2,940 support levels.
The price even traded below $2,900. However, the bulls were again active near the $2,860 support zone. A low was formed at $2,860 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is slowly moving higher above the $2,885 level.
Ethereum is now trading below $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $2,900 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,905 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,992 swing high to the $2,860 low.
An upside break above the trend line might send the price toward the $2,925 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The first major resistance is near the $2,940 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,992 swing high to the $2,860 low.

The next key resistance sits at $2,950, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,000 level. If there is a clear move above the $3,000 level, the price might rise and test the $3,050 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,150 resistance zone.
Another Drop In ETH?
If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,925 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,880 level.
The first major support is near the $2,860 zone. The next support is near the $2,810 level. A clear move below the $2,810 support might push the price toward $2,740. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,650 level in the near term.

                        BlackRock’s former global head of iShares and index investments, Salim Ramji, is joining Vanguard as its new CEO and board of directors from July 8.In an announcement, Vanguard said Ramji will take over from the current CEO Tim Buckley, who announced he would retire and step down from the firm in February this year.Ramji departed from his position at BlackRock in January 2024 where he was responsible for managing the majority of the firm’s client assets and overseeing the iShares platform. He joined BlackRock over a decade ago and under his tenure, the asset management firm launched the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund for retail investors.Vanguard is the second largest asset management firm after BlackRock.BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF ‘IBIT’
Commenting on Ramji’s appointment, Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the former BlackRock executive oversaw the filing and logistics of the IBIT ETF and he is known to have an interest in the digital assets space. Vanguard on the other hand is anti-crypto.Before joining BlackRock Ramji held the position of senior partner at McKinsey and was responsible for the firm’s asset and wealth management practice. Ramji started his career as a lawyer at Clifford Chance in London and Hong Kong.“He [Ramji] cares about advancing the interests of individual investors, has a strong fiduciary ethos, and thinks strategically about solutions,” said Buckley, in a press release.  “Salim understands our organization’s deep sense of purpose and commitment to put clients first, which is a hallmark of Vanguard’s leadership team and culture,” added Buckley.“The current investor landscape is changing, and that presents opportunities for Vanguard to further its mission of giving people the best chance for investment success, which is more relevant today than at any time in the firm’s five-decade history,” said Ramji.Vanguard’s Anti Crypto Stance 
In January, Vanguard said it had no immediate plans to add spot Bitcoin ETF to its platforms despite the introduction of such ETFs generating headlines and buzz in the industry.“Given the current state of crypto as an asset class, Vanguard does not have plans to launch its own bitcoin ETF or any crypto-related products. When deciding what investment products to offer, we consider a range of factors, including whether we believe they have enduring investment merit and meet our client’s needs,” wrote Janel Jackson, Vanguard’s head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker and Index Relations in a note.“While the discussion about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, has increased recently, we do not currently believe that there is an appropriate role for them to play in long-term portfolios,” adds Jackson.

The Gaming Revolution - Why On-Chain Purchases Are the Future - The Daily Hodl


								
 
‘Fortnite’ skins and PokéCoins may not seem more like a fun gimmick than an in-game necessity, but these kinds of in-game purchases make up an enormous $70 billion-plus market.
In-game purchases have been around for a minute. The first microtransaction sold by a major publisher was in 2006 when Bethesda sold horse armor in ‘The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion’ for $2.50.
Since then, the latter has exploded in popularity across different game universes. But therein lies the caveat.
In-game purchases like skins (i.e., digital assets) are by and large limited to the respective game ecosystems in which they are bought.
For example, the aforementioned Fortnite skins can only be used or displayed on Fortnite.
In addition to this, very few of these assets are tradable or monetizable by their owners in any shape or form.
This siloed approach to in-game purchases is not only frustrating for players, but it’s also a missed opportunity for developers.
By keeping these digital assets locked within their own ecosystems, they’re limiting the potential for cross-platform collaborations and missing out on the chance to create a thriving secondary market for digital goods.
Now, if you’re reading this, it should come as no surprise to suggest Web 3.0 as a solution to the problem.
Migrating in-game assets to on-chain networks like Ethereum’s allows players to have a wider range of control and true ownership of their assets.
By storing in-game assets on-chain, players will be able to easily sell, trade and effectively monetize their assets.
Let’s dive into how this works, and why it’s only the tip of the spear.
What do in-game purchases look like on-chain
Layer-two scaling solutions like Immutable have worked to provide NFT (non-fungible token) infrastructure on the Ethereum blockchain to reduce the cost of NFT minting.
The NFTs are, of course, representative of the in-game assets being purchased.
By selling assets as NFTs, Web 3.0 gamers have the ability to easily trade and transfer their in-game assets to different wallets.
Additionally, NFT assets give the game absolute ownership of their purchased goods.
While some argue that the first order of business is to simply prioritize using Web 3.0 as a way to store and transact purchasable game assets, others believe we should move the entire experience on-chain.
By creating a decentralized ecosystem for in-game assets, we can foster a new level of trust and transparency between players and developers.
Bad actors or game developers would be unable to manipulate prices and prevent gamers from being subject or entire games leaving the market (along with your in-game purchases).
With blockchain, everything is out in the open, verifiable and transferable.
Imagine being able to flaunt your hard-earned Fortnite skin in ‘Call of Duty’ or trading your ‘World of Warcraft’ sword for a rare Pokémon.
The future of gaming
So, what does the future of gaming look like with on-chain purchases?
For starters, we can expect to see a lot more cross-platform collaborations and integrations.
Developers will be incentivized to create assets that can be used across multiple games, creating a more interconnected gaming ecosystem.
We can also expect to see a rise in player-driven economies, where gamers have more control over the value of their digital assets.
With the ability to trade and sell items on secondary markets, players will be able to make real money from their gaming habits – something that’s already happening in the world of esports.
But perhaps the most exciting prospect is the potential for new types of gaming experiences that were never possible before.
Imagine a game where your actions and choices have real-world consequences, thanks to the use of smart contracts and decentralized governance.
Games could also improve on the largely flawed play-to-earn model, allowing you to earn cryptocurrency by completing quests and challenges.
Of course, the path to on-chain gaming is not without its challenges.
There are technical hurdles to overcome, such as scalability and interoperability between different blockchain networks.
There are also legal and regulatory issues to navigate – particularly when it comes to gambling and the use of tokens.
But perhaps the biggest challenge is convincing gamers and developers to embrace this new paradigm.
Change is never easy, and there will undoubtedly be resistance from those who are comfortable with the status quo.
But as more and more players experience the benefits of on-chain gaming, we can expect to see a gradual shift in attitudes.
Takeaways
Put simply, on-chain gaming in the near future isn’t just some Web 3.0 pipe dream – the possibility of a world where your skins, coins, loot boxes and others aren’t just meaningless pixels anymore is just around the bend.
In-game purchases will become valuable assets that you can trade and sell or even use across different games.
Sure, there are still some kinks to work out – like figuring out how to make everything play nicely together and convincing the bigwigs in the gaming industry to get on board.
However, once people start seeing the benefits of on-chain gaming, there’ll be no going back.

Bitcoin's Volatility Drops Below Major Tech Stocks, Signaling Maturity and Stability as an Asset Class



                    

Bitcoin‘s annual volatility has recently dipped below that of top tech stocks like Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia, positioning it closer to a more mature and stable asset class.



As of May 11, the 1-year realized volatility of Bitcoin was approximately 44.88%, which is lower than the over 50% seen in these major tech stocks. 




This marks a significant shift from Bitcoin’s earlier days when its volatility exceeded 200%, reflecting the usual traits of a new asset class experiencing high capital inflows.



The decreasing volatility signifies Bitcoin’s evolution, as Fidelity Investments reports. 



Notably, Bitcoin showed lower volatility compared to 33 out of approximately 500 S&P 500 index companies. 




A pivotal observation made in October 2023 highlighted that “Bitcoin was actually less volatile than 92 of the S&P 500 stocks in October of 2023 when using the 90-day realized historical volatility figures. 



Some of these names are also large-cap and mega-cap stocks.” This suggests a growing stability relative to significant market players.



Bitcoin’s stability trajectory mirrors that of gold in its early years, which initially faced high volatility followed by gradual stabilization. 



Gold, after its decoupling from the U.S. dollar in 1971, saw its volatility soar above 80 in the 1970s, nearly double that of Bitcoin’s in April 2024. 




However, as gold settled into an established asset class, its volatility lessened, paralleling Bitcoin’s current path toward integration into the broader financial landscape.

Recent comparisons further underscore Bitcoin’s maturation. 



Its current volatility is around 44% at price levels above $60,000, significantly lower than the 80% noted three years prior when prices were similar. 



Fidelity researcher Zack Wainwright explains the implications, stating, “Bitcoin was nearly half as volatile in 2024 at $60,000 when compared with 2021. 



When putting this all together, a thesis pointing toward a growing acceptance of Bitcoin due to potential maturation begins to emerge.”



The reduction in volatility has often preceded substantial price surges, indicating an increase in investor confidence and accumulation behavior. 



This pattern was observed in December 2023, when Bitcoin’s reduced volatility of about 43% was followed by a 75% price increase, driven by demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which had attracted $11.68 billion by May 11.



Looking ahead, significant investment inflows are expected from major institutional players, including sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, engaging with Bitcoin ETFs. 



BlackRock’s Robert Mitchnick and independent market analyst Scott Melker suggest that the growing institutional involvement, driven by Bitcoin’s newfound stability, could propel its price to between $100,000 and $150,000. 



Melker emphasizes the importance of patience, noting, “The massive institutional flood of money that will drive bitcoin to all-time highs.”

Vanguard names Bitcoin-friendly former BlackRock exec as new CEO

Asset management giant Vanguard has named Bitcoin-friendly former Blackrock executive Salim Ramji as its new CEO.With Ramji overseeing the approval and launch of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund earlier this year, his May 14 appointment to Vanguard has industry pundits wondering whether he will try to change the firm’s long-held opposition to Bitcoin (BTC), or even spark a late filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF. In a May 15 post to X, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said he doesn’t believe that Ramji would be able to see Vanguard launch its own spot Bitcoin ETF product. However, Seyffart does think Ramji could reverse Vanguard’s position on not allowing its clients to buy spot Bitcoin ETFs on its brokerage platform.Fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas shared a similar opinion but noted Ramji had spoken highly of Bitcoin and blockchain technology in the past:“Who knows... Door much more open now IMO.”Balchunas described Vanguard’s decision as a “semi-shock,” as it is the first time the firm has hired an outsider as its CEO.Source: Eric BalchunasRamji will replace Tim Buckley — a long-time Bitcoin critic — as Vanguard’s CEO starting July 8.Vanguard had been on the lookout for a new boss since late February this year when Buckley first announced his plans to retire.Ramji said he left BlackRock to “seek a new leadership or entrepreneurial opportunity” outside of BlackRock four days after he helped the firm launch its iShares Bitcoin Trust on Jan. 11, 2024. He served as BlackRock’s Global Head of iShares and Index Investments and was one of the firm’s Global Executive Committee members.Related: Vanguard among MicroStrategy’s largest shareholders, indirectly exposed to BitcoinSome of Vanguard’s long-time customers threatened to close their accounts in January when the investing firm decided not to offer the spot Bitcoin ETFs on its brokerage platform.The decision was made at a time when Vanguard offered the “Inverse Jim Cramer ETF.”Vanguard doubled down on its call not to offer a spot Bitcoin product, asserting that Bitcoin simply isn’t in line with the firm’s investment philosophy.“Our perspective is that these products do not align with our offer focused on asset classes such as equities, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio.”Magazine: Bitcoin ETFs make Coinbase a ‘honeypot’ for hackers and governments: Trezor CEO

Ethereum Spot ETF Approval Odds Decrease For Later This Month As Analyst Points Out SEC 'Considering the Security Question for the Asset' - Benzinga

Ethereum ETH/USD proponents might still be optimistic about a spot ETF approval but analysts tracking the developments increased the odds of a rejection by the SEC.What Happened: Analyzing a March filing submitted by BlackRock Inc. to the SEC over its ETF application, finance lawyer Scott Johnson discovered “official” signals of the regulator viewing Ethereum as a security.The SEC while delaying the approval, also sought public feedback on whether the applicant properly filed its ETF listing proposal as a commodity.Johnson noted that this question was asked for all the ETF filings and never for any Bitcoin BTC/USD spot/futures ETF product. "The obvious purpose is to potentially deny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they are holding a security," he added.Responding to his findings, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart increased the likelihood of a spot ETH ETF rejection, convinced that the regulator was considering the security question for ETH. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas entered the discussion as well, emphasizing, "Our odds of approval remain the same: slim to none."Why It Matters: The SEC is due to decide on VanEck's spot Ether ETF by May 23 – the final deadline for the first batch of proposals enabling investors to bet on the spot price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum’s status has become the major sticking point, with the SEC allegedly launching a covert operation to brand the cryptocurrency as a security. A rejection might pose further pain for the asset, already hampered by a sluggish market in recent weeks.Price Action: At the time of writing, ETH was exchanging hands at $2,888.08, following a 2.16% drop in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Dip As Wholesale Prices Breach Estimates: Analyst Explores Possibilities Of A Bitcoin Jump To $68K

Degens pumped GameStop memecoins because they're ‘bored’ - Traders

The price of unofficial GameStop memecoins have spiked alongside the rise of Gamestop’s (GME) share price due to a general sense of sluggishness in the market, say several crypto traders.“People are bored and are taking any little sign of hope they can,” pseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades told Cointelegraph.“The excitement generated around GameStop memecoins demonstrates there’s capital out there that’s not being allocated,” Tyr Capital chief investment officer Ed Hindi told Cointelegraph.The Solana-based memecoin GameStop (GME) — which has no affiliation to the official company — rose by 2,727% in the last two days, alongside Gamestop’s stock price experiencing a 204.50% increase during the same time frame, according to CoinMarketCap and Google Finance data.GME has risen 65.68% over the past 24-hours alone. Source: CoinMarketCapIt came after well-known GameStop stock trader Keith Gill posted from his “Roaring Kitty” X account on May 12 for the first time in nearly three years. Gill went dark on social media on June 19, 2021, but returned after an extended hiatus, posting a typically cryptic meme of a gamer sitting up in their chair to announce his comeback. Meanwhile, among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, PEPE (PEPE) and Floki (FLOKI) were the only tokens to sustain significant gains during the same timeframe, rising by 35.73% and 11.27% respectively. DOGE (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIBA) experienced spikes on May 12 but have since retraced by 1.76% and 1.39% over the past 24 hours.This signals that traders are chasing specific short-term narratives rather than having overall confidence in the entire market.“Investors are overreacting to short-term trends like the GameStop event precisely because the market is quiet at the moment. We need a new narrative in the crypto markets,” Hindi declared.Alongside this, the overall market sentiment has decreased over the past 30 days according to the Fear and Greed Index, falling by around 10 points to a "Greed" score of 64 as of May 15.Related: Bitcoin traders expect Fed Chair Powell to ‘pump our bags’ and BTC to target $80K+Daan believes that the GameStop price surge in the stock market reassured crypto traders that related memecoins in the crypto market would follow suit.“If the price moves up and people don't know why, they will think of narratives to support and explain why the price is doing what it does,” Daan explained, adding that the 2021 GameStop “saga is still on a lot of people's minds.”“I don't think anything but price going up needs to happen. I am always of the belief that price precedes narrative. So projects can have great fundamentals but if price doesn't move people don't care,” they added.On the contrary, Dynamo DeFi founder Patrick Scott believes “there’s no shortage of narratives” in the crypto market.“Tokenized real-world assets have grown from being practically nonexistent to billions of dollars in the past few years,” he told Cointelegraph and pointed to the trends currently emerging on the Solana and DePIN network:“Solana on-chain activity now rivals Ethereum, and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are bringing non-speculative revenue into crypto.”Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Controversial Social Media Personality Andrew Tate Dumps Bitcoin to Jin Meme Stock War on Hedge Funds | Cryptoglobe


                                
Andrew Tate, a former kickboxer known for his controversial online presence, has said on social media he sold $500,000 worth of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) to join the current meme stock trend and invest in GameStop (GME) in a bid to cripple a hedge fund manager betting against it.



In a series of videos on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Tate said that there’s a “hedge fund manager out there who’s going to lose $13 billion – his entire hedge fund – if the GameStop price opens at the current price.”



Tate’s motivations appear to be tied to a meme stock trading frenzy recently ignited that’s seemingly looking to mirror the 2021 meme stock frenzy that saw a $13 billion hedge fund, Melvin Capital, close its position on GME and accept significant losses on it.







The recent meme stock trading frenzy started after a trader central to the 2021 movement, Keith Gill, known on X as RoaringKitty and DFV on Reddit, after he returned to social media from a three-year hiatus that ended after his testimony in Congress.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

In a series of videos on social media, Tate noted that he is “going all-n, maximum leverage, all-in on all these stocks,” adding “we are taking down Wall Street, we’re going to take them down ourselves.”



Tate maintained that financial gain is secondary, prioritizing the downfall of the unnamed hedge fund manager. This renewed interest in GameStop stock has sent its value skyrocketing, with the company’s stock price surging more than 200% over the last few days to now trade close to the $50 mark.



AMC, another meme stock, saw its value surge nearly 120% over the same period. The meme stock frenzy extends beyond traditional markets, however, as an unofficial Solana-based mem coin inspired by GameStop has witnessed even more dramatic gains.



In a follow-up video, Tate doubled down and said he is cashing in $6 million worth of cryptocurrencies in a bid to take on Wall Street hedge funds and said he is “prepared to lose everything.”

Sonne Finance, BlockTower Capital Hit by Cyber Attacks


Sonne Finance, a decentralized liquidity market protocol operating on Optimism and Base, has been struck by a significant cyber attack.
Blockchain security firm Cyvers detected the attack on May 15 in the early morning of Asia.
Sonne Finance’s Optimism Market Suspended Following the Incident
Initially, Cyvers reported that $3 million had been stolen from Sonne’s USD Coin (USDC) and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) contracts on its Optimism chain. However, the situation quickly worsened. Within 30 minutes, Cyvers updated the loss estimate to $20 million.

“Sonne Finance, please take immediate action,” Cyvers warned.

About one hour after the warning, Sonne Finance addressed the incident on X (Twitter). The team also promised to provide more information later.

“All markets on Optimism have been paused. Markets on Base are safe,” it stated.

Following the incident, BeInCrypto discovered that scammers were attempting to exploit the situation. A fake X account, mimicking Sonne Finance, urged users to revoke all approvals to prevent loss.

It shared a suspicious link to “check exposure to the exploit” and revoke approvals. However, the tweet was later deleted.

BlockTower Capital, a crypto investment firm, also experienced a cyber attack in a separate development. Bloomberg cited undisclosed sources saying fraudsters partially drained BlockTower Capital’s main hedge fund. The funds are still missing, and the hacker remains at large.
Furthermore, the source said the firm hired blockchain forensics analysts to track the stolen money. They also recently updated their limited partners about the heist. As of now, BlockTower Capital has not made any official statements about the incident.
Indeed, hacking incidents continue to trouble the crypto space. BeInCrypto had previously reported a reduction in hacking incident frequency by over 65% as of April 2024.
Yet, the loss amounts remain significant. According to the SlowMist Weekly Security Report from April 28 to May 4, 2024, the total losses from crypto-related security incidents reached $71.39 million.
This attack on Sonne Finance highlights the vulnerabilities in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. It also shows the need for strong security measures to protect digital assets.

BlockTower has responded, hiring blockchain forensics analysts to investigate the theft.

Hackers remain a major threat to the crypto industry, even though they stole less money in total during 2023 compared to 2022.

In 2022, there were 219 hacks, while in 2023 that number rose to 231.Still, the total value stolen dropped by a significant 54.3%, reaching $1.7b in 2023. This decrease was mainly due to a decline in DeFi hacks. Hackers managed to steal $1.1b from DeFi platforms in 2023, a steep drop from the $3.1b they took in 2022.Meanwhile, Web3 users lost $336m to hackers and scams in the first three months of 2024. A significant chunk, nearly half, was stolen in January. Despite the concerning losses, this actually represents a 23% improvement compared to the same period in 2023.

This Public Japanese Firm Has Added Bitcoin as Its Reserve Asset


																Bitcoin has continued to gain mainstream adoption, with major corporations and top industry dogs incorporating the digital asset into their long-term financial strategies.
Metaplanet, a Japanese investment and consulting company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, is the most recent firm to make such a remarkable move.
Metaplanet Makes Bitcoin Reserve Asset
According to an official release, Metaplanet has adopted Bitcoin in its treasury management strategy, making the cryptocurrency its reserve asset. The company will prioritize a Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only approach, utilizing long-dated Japanese yen (JPY) liabilities and periodic share issuances as financial options to continually purchase more BTC.
“Metaplanet views bitcoin as fundamentally superior to any and all other forms of political currency, traditional stores of value and investment, and all other crypto-assets/securities. Bitcoin is an absolutely scarce digital synthetic monetary commodity, with no central issue,” the company said.
Metaplanet’s announcement comes roughly a month after the firm invested one billion JPY ($6.5 million) into BTC, marking its transition to the leading crypto asset.
The investment and consulting firm said the move is a response to the economic pressures on Japan, the weak yen, long periods of negative interest rates, and high government debt levels. Metaplanet’s new approach will increase on a BTC per share basis, enhancing shareholder value in the long term.




Struggles of the Japanese Yen
Japan’s challenging economic landscape saw the yen fall to 34-year lows a few weeks ago, amounting to a 50% depreciation against the USD in the past decade. Metaplanet explained that the country’s unsustainable financial trajectory suggests an increasing rate of monetary devaluation in the future.
Additionally, Metaplanet revealed that Japan’s debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is 261%, the highest in the developed world. The Bank of Japan implemented a negative interest rate policy in 2016 and artificially suppressed borrowing costs by printing the yen to purchase government bonds.
“This weakness is evident to all market participants and is only temporarily masked by sporadic interventions from the BoJ in both the government bond and foreign exchange markets,” the company added.
Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy would fortify its balance sheet against further devaluation of the yen and position the company as a BTC-focused investment vehicle.

PEPE Explodes To All-Time Highs - Leaves Dogecoin, Solana Trailing In the Dust - Benzinga

Frog-themed meme coin Pepe PEPE/USD stormed to an all-time high Tuesday, rendering all of its holders in profit at one point in the day.What Happened: The coin became the largest gainer in the memecoin market in the last 24 hours, and one of the largest in the broader market, with gains of more than 10%, according to data from Benzinga Pro. About 98% of its holders were making money at the time of publication, according to IntoTheBlock data, with the figure hitting 100% earlier in the day.The meme token pipped large-cap cryptocurrencies like Solana SOL/USD, BNB BNB/USD, and Dogecoin DOGE/USD in 24-hour trading volume, totaling $3.8 billion.The upsurge caught the eye of investors, leading some to fill their bags with PEPE. A trader withdrew more than 407 billion tokens, worth $4.4 million at prevailing market prices, according to Spotonchain. The big grab indicated expectations of PEPE's value rising further in the days to come.Why It Matters: Pepe was likely benefiting from the frenzy caused by the return of retail trader "Roaring Kitty," a catalyst that also sent other meme tokens flying. The surge also signaled the start of the second meme coin bull market of the year, the first of which in March offered enthusiasts of this class of cryptocurrencies enormous profits.In fact, one cryptocurrency trader underlined how it was the meme coins that were netting solid returns, while fundamental and utility tokens were letting them down.Price Action: At the time of writing, PEPE was exchanging hands at $$0.00001106, following a 10% jump in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Image Via ShutterstockRead Next: Ethereum Spot ETF Approval Odds Decrease For Later This Month As Analyst Points Out SEC ‘Considering the Security Question for the Asset’

Bitcoin could top $100K but only if 'high-yield rate' falls below 7% - Analyst

Only one main indicator is necessary to predict whether or not Bitcoin (BTC) can surpass its all-time high of $73,700 later this year, and it all rests on the shoulders of the United States Federal Reserve, says one analyst. “The U.S. high yield rate is a great indicator and it really needs to drop below 6 or 7% for a sustainable all-time high,” Timothy Peterson — Cane Island Alternative Advisors founder and investment manager — told Cointelegraph, explaining that the primary measure he looks to for Bitcoin's price action is interest rate movement.At the time of publication, the U.S. high yield rate — which represents the rate of high-yield corporate bonds because of their higher risk of default — is 7.54%, as per YCharts data.Peterson predicted that if yield rates fall within the “6 or 7%” range, Bitcoin could see the much anticipated $100,000 price tag by the fourth quarter of 2024, or at the latest second quarter of 2025.The US High Yield B Effective Yield is currently 7.54%. Source: YChartsTypically, the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates leads to the high-yield rate following suit, something that nearly two-thirds of economists surveyed predict will happen in September this year, per a recent survey conducted by Reuters.Interest rates are perceived as an important indicator for crypto traders, as lowering rates typically leads to less yield for investors in safe-haven securities such as bonds and term deposits. As a result, more investors turn to riskier assets such as Bitcoin to achieve better returns on investment.Bitcoin is currently trading at $61,871, down 5.08% over past 30-days. Source: CoinMarketCapPeterson argued that overall markets are generally “flat and volatile” between September and October.“Not always, but many times,” he commented, but with the upcoming U.S. election later this year, he claimed the “uncertainty will be higher through October,” ahead of the election day currently slated for November 4.Related: Bitcoin traders expect Fed Chair Powell to ‘pump our bags’ and BTC to target $80K+Meanwhile, crypto analyst Scott Melker, also known as "The Wolf of All Streets," declared that the Fed cutting interest rates isn't always favorable for assets outside of fixed-income investments.“There is a wildly popular theory that a Fed pivot is good for markets,” he stated in a May 14 post on X.“Rate cuts generally precede major dips,” he commented on the wider overall market.Magazine: Buy altcoins now, but sell before ‘mid-2025’: Charles Edwards, X Hall of FlameThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This Billionaire Predicted Bitcoin to Consolidate in Q2 2024


Michael Novogratz, the esteemed founder of Galaxy Digital Holdings, recently declared that Bitcoin might consolidate within a specific price range in the near future. 
During a conference call following his company’s first-quarter financial disclosure, he provided insights into the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. 
What can Cause a Bitcoin Breakout From the Consolidation?
Novogratz highlighted the integration of cryptocurrency into traditional finance as a pivotal factor in maintaining Bitcoin’s price within this range.

“We are in the consolidation phase in crypto. Bitcoin, Ethereum and everything else will consolidate, what does that mean? It means probably somewhere between $55,000 and $75,000 until the next set of circumstances, the next set of market events bring us higher,” Novogratz said on a conference call


This anticipated stabilization comes after a remarkable bull run driven by significant market catalysts such as the launch of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the halving event. The latter is a code update that reduces the issuance of new Bitcoin, historically serving as a bullish catalyst.
Following these events, the market has seen a period of stagnation. This is largely due to diminished optimism about potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, influenced by strong economic indicators. Since late February, Bitcoin’s price has fluctuated between $56,500 and $73,700.

“We had a lot of tailwinds in Q4 and Q1. I think that is probably where we are certainly for this quarter, maybe next quarter until either A, the Fed starts cutting rates because the economy finally slows or B, we get through the election and I think the election will bring clarity one way or the other to the crypto regulatory landscape,” Novogratz said.

Furthermore, the political environment could influence the market. Analyst Geoffrey Kendrick from Standard Chartered remarked that a potential re-election of Donald Trump could lead to less stringent crypto regulations compared to those under President Joe Biden. Such a policy shift might encourage global treasury holders to explore alternative financial assets like Bitcoin, potentially propelling its value upwards.
In March, Trump himself hinted at a softer regulatory approach toward cryptocurrencies, diverging from his prior preference for traditional currency. Despite never purchasing Bitcoin himself, Trump recognized its growing role in commerce. 


“There has been a lot of use of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and I’m not sure I want to take them away at this point,” he commented. 

Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital reported a robust first quarter, with net income soaring to $421.7 million, marking a significant increase from the previous period. The company’s mining operations also grew substantially, generating a record $31.5 million in revenue.

This reflects a 69% rise from the previous quarter, fueled by an expansion in mining capacity. Galaxy’s trading revenue surged to $66 million, up 78%, driven largely by gains from derivatives and positive asset price movements.

Ethereum supply up by 100,000: What about ETH's 'deflationary status'? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum loses ultrasound money status.
Total supply has increased by over 100,000.

Ethereum [ETH] has transitioned from being labeled “ultrasound money” due to the EIP-1559 upgrade, which has altered its deflationary characteristics. 
This upgrade reduced Ethereum’s burn rate, leading to a slowdown in the rate at which Ether is removed from circulation. 
The total supply of ETH has increased, and there has been a recent rise in the supply of ETH on exchanges. How does the supply on exchanges compare to the total supply?
Ethereum total supply and fees burnt display contrasting trends
The analysis of Ethereum’s supply metric on CryptoQuant reveals notable fluctuations in total supply dynamics over recent months. 
From November 2023 to early April 2024, there was a discernible decrease in ETH’s total supply, dropping from over 120.2 million to approximately 120.06 million, marking a reduction of over 100,000 Ether.
Source: CryptoQuant
However, beginning from the 19th of April, Ethereum’s total supply started to ascend, reaching around 120.1 million at the time of this analysis. 
This recent increase in total supply is attributed to a decline in the fees burnt, which commenced following the Dencum upgrade.
An examination of the fees burnt metric illustrates a significant decrease, starting around March. 
During this period, fees burnt were approximately 6,000 Ether, contrasting sharply with the current value of around 890 ETH at the time of this analysis. 
This significant reduction in fees burnt accounts for the observed uptick in Ethereum’s total supply, indicating a shift in its deflationary dynamics. 
Also, the decline in fees burn is due to the decline in fees on the network.
Source: CryptoQuant
Ethereum sees a decline in overall fees 
The recent Ethereum upgrade has led to a reduction in transaction fees, both on the main network and its Layer 2 solutions. 
Data from Coin98 Analytics indicated that Ethereum transaction fees has reached a yearly low, averaging 0.00017E, which translates to approximately $0.5 per transaction.
 This fees marks a significant decrease compared to levels observed around February.
Furthermore, analysis of the overall fees generated on the Ethereum network revealed a noticeable decline in recent times. 
As of this writing, the total fees were around $3.6 million, contrasting sharply with the peak recorded in March, which stood at approximately $7.8 million. 
This downward trend in fees commenced about a month ago.
Ethereum supply on exchanges climbs
Analysis of the Ethereum exchange supply indicates a notable upward trend, albeit with some interesting nuances. 
The increase in exchange supply began before the total supply started to rise, with the growth, observed between March and press time, amounting to over 3 million Ether.
 As of this writing, the total exchange supply was over 16.8 million.
Source: Santiment
Despite this significant growth, the exchange supply remained relatively low compared to the total supply of Ethereum. This suggests that Ethereum is facing a manageable risk of oversupply.
 Furthermore, the proportionately low exchange supply indicates that the current price of Ethereum is not under immediate threat from inflationary pressures.
ETH continues to trend below $3,000
Analysis of the Ethereum price trend on the daily timeframe is reflecting a challenging period. Following its drop below the $3,000 price level in the previous week, ETH has struggled to regain its footing. 
As of this writing, it was trading at around $2,900, experiencing a decline of approximately 1.5%.

Both the Stochastic indicator and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) were signaling a negative price trend. The RSI, in particular, indicated a bearish trend as it remained below the neutral line. 
However, the current position of these indicators suggested a potential price reversal in the near future, with ETH poised for a possible uptick.

Who's Buying The Bitcoin ETFs? Bitwise CIO Shares Insights


								In a new memo, Matt Hougan, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan offered a detailed analysis of the early adopters of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) based on 13F filings with the SEC. His insights underscore a significant embrace of Bitcoin ETFs by professional investment firms, heralding a potential shift in the landscape of BTC investments.
Since their launch on January 11, Bitcoin ETFs have captured an impressive $11.7 billion in assets, making them the most successful ETF launch in the annals of financial products. This explosive start has sparked widespread interest in the identities of the investors—whether they are predominantly retail or professional.
Who Is Buying The Spot Bitcoin ETFs?
Hougan’s memo provides a clear answer. “A lot of professional investors own bitcoin ETFs,” he stated. These aren’t just any investors; they are some of the most respected and substantial asset managers in the industry. For instance, Hightower Advisors, ranked as the #2 RIA firm in the US by Barron’s and managing $122 billion in assets, now holds $68 million in Bitcoin ETFs. Similarly, Bracebridge Capital, a prominent Boston-based hedge fund that manages endowment funds for institutions like Yale and Princeton, has invested a hefty $434 million.

Other significant stakeholders include Cambridge Investment Research with $40 million, Sequoia Financial Advisors at $12 million, Integrated Advisors holding $11 million, and Brown Advisory with $4 million in Bitcoin ETF holdings. Altogether, as of the latest data from last Thursday, 563 professional investment firms have reported owning a combined $3.5 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs. Hougan anticipates that by the May 15 filing deadline, these numbers could grow to over 700 firms with total assets under management nearing $5 billion.
“This is absolutely massive,” Hougan explained. “For any financial advisor, family office, or institution wondering if they were the only ones considering Bitcoin exposure, the answer is clear: You are not alone.”
From a historical perspective, the scale of professional investor ownership has been described as unprecedented. Eric Balchunas, a senior Bloomberg ETF analyst, referred to the number of large-scale investors involved in the Bitcoin ETFs as “bonkers.” By comparison, when gold ETFs launched in late 2004—a launch previously regarded as the most successful of all time—they attracted more than $1 billion in just five days. However, their first 13F filings showed only 95 professional firms investing. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have dramatically exceeded this mark right from their initial filings.

Despite this surge in professional interest, Hougan’s memo cautions that the total $50 billion assets under management in Bitcoin ETFs still have a substantial portion owned by retail investors. He estimates that professional investors currently account for only 7-10% of all assets. However, he suggested that media portrayal of these ETFs as “retail-driven” funds might overlook a critical emerging trend.
“Most investors follow a familiar pattern,” Hougan stated, describing a typical four-step investment trajectory observed among institutions. Initially, there is a period of due diligence lasting 6-12 months. Following this, professionals might make a small personal allocation to test the waters before recommending broader allocations to their clients. Eventually, this leads to more substantial, platform-wide allocations across their entire book of clients, typically ranging from 1-5% of the portfolio.
Given these insights, Hougan remains “incredibly” bullish about the future of Bitcoin ETFs. He concluded, “The allocations we see in recent 13F filings are just a down payment.” He highlighted that firms like Hightower Advisors, with a current 0.05% allocation, could potentially increase their investments substantially. “Multiply that by the growing number of professional investors participating in the space, and you can begin to see what’s behind my enthusiasm.”
Remarkably, yesterday, after Hougan released the memo, there was probably the most important 13F disclosure for Bitcoin to date. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board reported buying $99,167,688 (2,450,400 shares) of BlackRock’s IBIT and $63,687,310 (1,013,000 shares) of Grayscale’s GBTC.
At press time, the BTC price stood at $61,940.

Former FTX Exec Ryan Salame Asks for 18 Months in Prison

In filings, his attorneys argue that Salame’s role at the shuttered companies was less central to the fraud and more operational. They also cite cooperation with authorities, genuine remorse, efforts to address his substance abuse issues, and the significant personal and financial losses he has already suffered as a result of the exchange’s collapse.

                        Stablecoin issuer Circle plans to relocate its legal base from the Republic of Ireland to the US.Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that the company recently filed court paperwork to re-domicile. This follows Circle submitting plans for an initial public offering to the US securities regulator in January.“The initial public offering is expected to take place after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions,” Circle said at the time.Circle Heads for US Shores, Leaving Ireland’s Tax Perks Behind
Choosing the US as its new home could mean Circle faces a higher tax burden, according to Bloomberg. Companies would generally do the opposite, flocking to Ireland for its business-friendly environment and low tax rate.The country’s 12.5% rate pales in comparison to many other European nations. This makes Ireland a magnet for international firms looking to keep taxes down.IPO Awaits SEC Nod and Market Conditions
Launched in 2013, Circle has carved a niche in the crypto industry. It is best known for issuing USDC, a stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. As of May 2024, USDC boasts a market cap exceeding $32b, solidifying its place as a major player.Circle’s core business focuses on issuing and managing USDC. Stablecoins are generally said to provide stability for transactions in the often-turbulent cryptocurrency market.Further, Circle’s plan to go public through a traditional IPO follows a failed 2021 attempt via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger. The IPO will proceed after SEC approval, but remains subject to market conditions and other factors.In January, Circle revealed plans to introduce USDC on the Celo network. Celo is a Layer-1 blockchain evolving into an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling network. This collaboration seeks to capitalize on Celo’s mobile-centric user community in areas with the highest blockchain adoption rates.

                        El Salvador, which became the first nation to use Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender, could easily hold 5,750 Bitcoins, per “Bitcoin Office” report. The national Bitcoin Office is a government entity aimed at managing all projects related to the cryptocurrency.Per a Reuters report, the nation mined nearly 474 Bitcoins since 2021 using geothermal power fueled from the Tecapa volcano.The power plant’s official data released Tuesday, noted that the government holdings accounts to over $354 million at current prices. With the BTC wealth pool, the nation launched a Website on Tuesday for tracking its Bitcoin Treasury.The nation’s current Bitcoin holdings and the launch of a memepool website, signifies that El Salvador might eventually become one of the wealthiest countries in the world.Interestingly, President Bukele also stated that he has no plans to sell the country’s vast Bitcoin holdings. Bukele’s administration has installed 300 processors to mine Bitcoins from the volcano, the report added.El Salvador’s Bitcoin Mining From Geothermal Power
The geothermal state-owned power plant devotes 1.5 megawatts (MW) to cryptocurrency mining, out of its 102 MW produced.“We don’t spend resources that contaminate the environment, we don’t depend on oil, we don’t depend on natural gas, on any resource that isn’t renewable,” Daniel Álvarez, president of the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Executive Commission, which oversees the plant, told AP News back in 2021.Bitcoin mining in El Salvador would appear to have a supportive government in Bukele. However, when it comes to cheap electricity, the nation imports about one-fifth to one-quarter of its electricity. The rest of the electricity production is divided among hydroelectric, geothermal and plants fired by fossil fuels.Among those, geothermal accounts for about a quarter of the country’s energy, given that El Salvador has 20 active volcanoes.According to a 2021 report, the energy produced from the geothermal turbines source about 300 computers. Bitcoins are “mined” using computers that solve complex mathematical problems and require a large amount of electricity to operate.In an industry that still relies heavily on polluting coal-fired power plants, the Salvadoran government is touting the use of clean energy for local mining.

BlockTower Capital Drained by Fraudsters


According to a Wednesday report by Bloomberg, the main hedge fund of cryptocurrency investment firm BlockTower Capital has fallen victim to a hacking incident.The stolen money has not been recovered yet. BlockTower Capital is currently working with blockchain sleuths in order to figure out how the hacking incident took place. The report has not specified what amount of assets has been stolen.BlockTower Capital was co-founded back in 2017 by former university endowment manager Ari Paul and former investment banker Matthew Goetz. In 2021, it acquired rival Gamma Point Capital to launch its market-neutral fund. However, the fund was shut down last year due to the lack of investment opportunities. BlockTower officially rolled out its $150 million venture capital fund in October 2022.The crypto investment firm has been impacted by hacking incidents before. In February 2023, BlockTower Capital was affected by the $1.5 million hack of decentralized exchange aggregator Dexible. BlockTower Capital suffered another setback due to its exposure to Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank, two cryptocurrency-friendly banks that went underwater last March. Crypto hacks plaguing the industry Cryptocurrency hacks remain a major issue for the nascent cryptocurrency industry. In 2022, hackers stole a whopping $4 billion. Last year, the amount of stolen funds reached $2 billion. Some of the most notable cryptocurrency victims of 2023 include Mixin Network, Euler Finance, Multichain, Atomic Wallet, and Poloniex. Meanwhile, according to UN experts, North Korea managed to launder nearly $150 million worth of stolen crypto this March alone.

LayerZero Sybil Bounty Event Will Be Launched With 15% Allocation For Fraudulent Addresses - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The LayerZero sybil bounty event starts May 18, and users who report fraudulent addresses will be rewarded by May 31.



Self-reporting sybil addresses, by May 17, receive 15% of their token allocation, while identified sybils get nothing.



Data from over 100,000 self-reported sybils will help LayerZero and Nansen train AI to detect fraud, benefiting future projects like zkSync.




LayerZero has announced the commencement of the LayerZero sybil bounty event, which aims to identify and penalize fraudulent actors in the crypto community.





LayerZero Sybil Bounty Event Will Be Launched on May 18



The LayerZero sybil bounty event starts at 02:00 UTC on May 18, with bounty reports closing at 23:59 UTC on May 31. Participants in the bounty program are required to submit reports that detail clear methods for at least 20 suspect addresses.



Bounty hunters who successfully identify a “sybil” (a fraudulent address) will receive 10% of the sybil’s expected token distribution, while the identified witch will receive no distribution. Addresses that self-report their fraudulent behavior by May 17 at 23:59 UTC will receive 15% of their intended allocation. Those who fail to self-report and are later identified by LayerZero or through the bounty hunt will not receive any tokens.



LayerZero CEO Bryan Pellegrino previously disclosed on the X platform that up to 100,000 addresses had voluntarily reported themselves as sybils to secure 15% of the initial airdrop tokens. Pellegrino emphasized the value of collecting data on these sybil wallets, which will help identify similar fraudulent activities in future projects.




Utilizing AI to Combat Sybil Attacks



LayerZero has also opened a public disclosure portal for users to confess their sybil behavior. The project will subsequently release a list of identified sybil addresses and initiate the bounty program to encourage community-driven reporting of sybil activities.



This initiative is part of LayerZero’s strategy to curb sybil attacks, where individuals create multiple accounts to maximize token airdrop benefits. LayerZero and Nansen, a blockchain analytics firm, will use a dataset of over 100,000 samples to train AI systems to detect sybil patterns, potentially benefiting future airdrops in other projects.



There are indications that zkSync might utilize Nansen’s AI to verify sybil wallet addresses for its upcoming airdrop, highlighting the broader impact of LayerZero’s efforts on the crypto ecosystem.



LayerZero has implemented snapshots as of May 1, giving users until May 18 to self-report their sybil behavior before the LayerZero sybil bounty event launches.

Layer-2 SocialFi Lens Network Based On zkSync Technology Launched - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Lens, the on-chain social network, is transitioning to its new home, the SocialFi Lens Network, built on zkSync’s ZK Stack hyperchains.



Developed by Lens Lab under Avara, Lens Protocol is moving to Layer-2 development, integrating Matter Labs’ ZK Stack for high throughput and cost-effective transactions.



Lens Network emphasizes data ownership and privacy, setting a new standard in social network construction while encouraging the migration of applications from Momoka to Lens Network.




Lens, the on-chain social network infrastructure, is undergoing a significant transition with the launch of its new home, the SocialFi Lens Network.





Lens Protocol Evolves: Introducing the SocialFi Lens Network



The move marks a pivotal moment for Lens, as it builds upon the foundation laid by the original Lens Protocol within zkSync’s ZK Stack hyperchains.



Originally developed by Lens Lab under the umbrella of Avara, the team behind the renowned DeFi giant Aave, Lens Protocol ventured into Layer-2 development with the vision of fostering a network of SocialFi applications. Currently operational on the Polygon Proof-of-Stake chain since May 2022, Lens is now poised to elevate its capabilities with the launch of Lens Network.



Matter Labs Collaboration Sets New Standard for Social Network Construction



The new protocol, leveraging Matter Labs’ modular ZK Stack infrastructure, will integrate a hybrid validium and volition Layer-2 solution. This integration aims to seamlessly interface with both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and non-EVM compatible blockchains, facilitating developers in building applications on Lens Network. Moreover, Lens Network will prioritize high transaction throughput for mainstream consumer applications while ensuring cost-effective transactions.




One of the notable features of SocialFi Lens Network is its utilization of account abstraction, enabling gas-free and no-login transactions for users. While Momoka, a Layer-3 Optimism solution launched by Lens in April 2023, will continue to operate, Lens encourages applications to migrate to Lens Network as it plans to discontinue Momoka.



Alex Gluchowski, co-founder and CEO of Matter Labs, commends Lens Network for setting a new standard in social network construction, addressing users’ concerns regarding data ownership, censorship resistance, and privacy seamlessly. Lens celebrated its permissionless launch in late February, witnessing a significant surge in daily activity and maintaining a steady active user count.

Dan Tapiero Says Bitcoin Turning ‘Scary Bullish,’ Unveils BTC Price Target After Clear Break of This Level - The Daily Hodl


								Macro investor and fund manager Dan Tapiero believes Bitcoin (BTC) is gearing up to print fresh all-time highs (ATHs).
The CEO of investment firm 10T Holdings tells his 115,600 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could soar more than 45% from its current value if it crosses $65,000 again.










“Starting to look scary bullish for Bitcoin. Break of $65,000 goes right to $90,000, and then more. Very clear sideways overlapping flag type consolidation nearly done. Markets always surprise. Specific catalyst unclear but it doesn’t matter.”
Source: Dan Tapiero/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests that Bitcoin is on the verge of completing a bull flag pattern, which in technical analysis is defined as a long upward trend, followed by a short period of downward consolidation before an upward breakout.
Tapiero believes that the Fed will cut interest rates this year due to commercial real estate weakness. He also predicts an even larger growth rate is coming to the ecosystem of digital assets.
“Fed is killing commercial real estate. No inflation here. Rates need to move lower pronto. Still expect 3%. Super bullish gold, Bitcoin, Ethereum. And ‘on-chain’ spring is upon us. Digital asset ecosystem growth is spectacular. Hypergrowth phase coming now.” 
Tapiero recently said that crypto assets are growing exponentially against traditional financial world assets and that an increasing number of investors will start moving over to digital assets to benefit from the larger returns.
Bitcoin is trading for $61,920 at time of writing, down nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.

Shiba Inu's Rocky Road to 2.5 Cents: Analysts Predict Long-Term Surge Despite Current Market Challenges



                    

The journey for the cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) towards a potential price of 2.5 cents has been filled with challenges and fluctuations. 



Recently, the crypto market experienced a surge of enthusiasm that temporarily boosted several tokens, including Shiba Inu. 




However, this optimism quickly waned as the market downturn took over, leading to a significant decrease in SHIB’s value.



Currently, Shiba Inu is priced at $0.00002259, reflecting an 8.14% drop over the past week and a stark 32% decline from its price 60 days ago. 



Despite the enthusiasm of SHIB supporters for a substantial increase to $0.025, the path to reaching such a milestone appears increasingly difficult.




Amidst these market uncertainties, the analytics platform Telegaon has provided some insights into SHIB’s future price movements. 



According to their analysis, Shiba Inu might achieve the $0.025 mark between the years 2035 and 2040. 



Starting from its current price, SHIB would need to undergo a massive rally of 110,568% to reach this target.



This ambitious growth forecast is not unfounded considering Shiba Inu’s historical performance.

In January 2021, SHIB was trading at a mere $0.00000001, as per data from CoinMarketCap. 



By October of the same year, the cryptocurrency had surged to its all-time high of $0.00008845, marking an impressive 884,400% increase. 



This historical precedent suggests that a 110,568% rally is within the realm of possibility for Shiba Inu.



In their forecast, Telegaon anticipates that SHIB will eliminate three leading zeros from its price to hit the $0.025 mark in about 16 years. 



This view is corroborated by analysts at the cryptocurrency exchange Changelly, who also support a 2040 timeline for Shiba Inu to reach this price threshold.



As the crypto community watches these developments, the potential for Shiba Inu to replicate its past explosive growth remains a topic of keen interest and speculation. 



The consensus among experts seems to lean towards a long-term horizon for SHIB to achieve these ambitious goals.

BlockTower Capital Faces Security Breach, Loses Funds


							

BlockTower Capital has suffered significant losses in a recent hack, according to people familiar with the matter.



The hacker and the stolen amount are yet to be identified, and the firm has appointed a team to investigate.



Last year, the firm shut down its “market neutral” crypto fund, which once boasted over $100 million.




The institutional investment firm BlockTower Capital has reportedly suffered significant losses from a recent exploitation. A recent Bloomberg report stated that the company’s total loss in the hack remains undisclosed, and the hackers are yet to be identified.



BlockTower was founded in 2017 and has offices in Miami and New York. The firm has invested in various institutions, including the NFT developer Dapper Labs, the blockchain platform Terraform Labs, and the gaming studio Sky Mavis. While the firm raised a $150 million venture fund in 2022, BlockTower boasts around $1.7 billion in assets under management (AuM).



According to the Bloomberg report, the undisclosed fund is still missing. To identify the exploiter and recover the funds, BlockTower has appointed blockchain forensics analysts. The team is supposed to study the hack and find out the exact amount stolen.









In February 2023, decentralized exchange aggregator Dexible reported about a hacker who drained funds from many wallets. While the losses faced by these “few whales” accounted for 85% of the total loss, BlockTower was identified as one of the large victims. Though BlockTower declined to comment then, reports stated that the hacker stole about $1.5 million worth of TRU tokens from a wallet linked to BlockTower.



The report further shed light on the company’s last year setback. BlockTower shut down its “market neutral” crypto fund, which once boasted over $100 million.



Crypto hacks are one of the major threats in the industry that prevent new users from entering the market. Rosco Kalis, founder of Revoke.cash, stated that the users should be adequately educated on crypto to prevent these security threats.

Robinhood enables Solana staking for customers in Europe - Blockworks


Robinhood’s European crypto branch launched Solana staking.
The feature will offer roughly 5% APY at launch, though that could vary as staking rewards change, Robinhood Crypto general manager Johann Kerbrat told Blockworks in an interview. 
This puts Robinhood Crypto a tick below Coinbase, which offers an estimated reward of 5.42% for Solana stakers. The Phantom wallet offers Solana staking with an APY as high as 7.58%.
The firm chose Solana for its first staking product because SOL’s one of the most popular tokens among its EU customers, and staking on Solana is simpler than on Ethereum, Kerbrat said.

(Bitcoin is the most-held crypto among EU customers, Robinhood said in a press release.)
Kerbrat mentioned that the company was drawn to Solana’s shorter bonding period — the amount of time it takes before newly-staked assets begin earning yield. Solana’s bonding period is roughly two days, while Ethereum’s varies from a few days to a few weeks.
When asked if Robinhood Crypto would add staking for additional assets — like Ethereum — in the future, Kerbrat said “we are definitely thinking about it,” but declined to go into specifics. 
Robinhood Crypto launched in December as a crypto trading app in the European Union. The entity is registered and regulated in Lithuania, according to a Robinhood blog post. The company’s crypto arm noted that its app is highly downloaded by users in Poland, Italy and Lithuania.

Robinhood Crypto lists 33 tokens, as opposed to Robinhood’s US trading app, which only offers 15 crypto assets — even fewer in New York and Texas. 
SOL and Solana memecoins including BONK and DogWifHat are available in the EU but not the US.
Robinhood’s US arm delisted Solana — among other cryptocurrencies alleged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to be unregistered securities — in June of last year after the agency filed lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance.
Robinhood’s crypto efforts in Europe are perhaps overshadowed by the company receiving a Wells Notice from the US SEC for its crypto listings last week.

Robinhood and Robinhood’s EU crypto branch are “completely separate entities with different business models and different structures, and so at this point, the business in Europe is completely isolated from what’s happening in the US,” Kerbrat said.

                        The cryptocurrency market has witnessed the launch of over 1 million new tokens since the beginning of April.Ethereum and Solana, in particular, have been at the forefront of this token frenzy, with Ethereum hosting over 370,000 new tokens and Solana boasting an impressive 640,000 new tokens, mostly consisting of memecoins, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard.On the Ethereum network, a staggering 372,642 new tokens have emerged since April 1.Coinbase’s Base Attracts Majority of New Tokens
It’s worth noting that 88% of these tokens, amounting to 327,553, were launched on Coinbase‘s layer-2 blockchain Base.The surge in activity on the layer-2 network can be attributed to the growing interest in memecoins, as users are drawn to the low-cost environment for creating these types of tokens.In fact, Coinbase director Conor Grogan highlighted that the number of tokens created on Base within this short timeframe is double the total tokens created on Ethereum between 2015 and 2023.Simultaneously, Solana has seen a significant influx of new tokens, with an astounding 643,227 tokens created since April.Among these, approximately 466,914 tokens were memecoins, according to data from Step Finance.The popularity of memecoins on Solana is evident, as a dedicated dashboard tracking the number of new tokens launched on the Solana-based memecoin platform pump.fun confirms the trend.The rise of memecoins has sparked mixed reactions within the crypto community.Some argue that the proliferation of memecoins has had a negative impact on the industry, leading to an increase in scams and rug pulls.Critics view the abundance of memecoins as a diversion of funds from more legitimate projects. They argue that scammers now hold real money that could have been invested in projects with genuine potential.The surge in new memecoins has also raised concerns about spam and the use of sniper bots.These automated bots, designed to swiftly acquire new memecoins in hopes of profiting from a potential breakout, have been seen as a hindrance to the ecosystem.They contribute to the perception of memecoins as a speculative and volatile segment of the market.Despite the criticisms and concerns surrounding memecoins, they have proved to be a profitable narrative in the first quarter of the year.Solana Meme Coin Season Presales Amass $150 Million
The surge in Solana meme coin presale scams comes as these events have amassed a staggering $150 million in SOL from only 33 presales.Despite the allure of quick gains, analysts have emphasized that many of these projects, often promoted by smaller accounts, are either dubious or outright scams.Moreover, the lack of transparency and accountability within the meme coin space on Solana heightens the risk for investors owing to the prevalence of rug pulls and disappearing funds.Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner at DWF Labs, has also recently cautioned against such token presales.“This ‘send coins to this address for presale’ reminds me 2017 ICO boom,” he wrote on X.“It happens always when a lot of people become rich accidentally. It’d FOMO until money change their owners. Remember, you made money because someone made wrong decisions.”

GameStop Might Have Outperformed Bitcoin's Yearly Returns In A Single Day But Here's Why King Crypto Evokes More Optimism - GameStop (NYSE:GME) - Benzinga

Shares of video game retailer GameStop Corp. GME have lifted exponentially this week, trumping the world’s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin's BTC/USD yearly gains in a single day. What Happened: GameStop shares rallied 190% since the week began, according to data from Benzinga Pro, pumped by retail traders' excitement over the return of Keith Gill, aka "Roaring Kitty", a central character in the previous rally of shares in January 2021. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has risen 125% over the past year, paling in comparison to the GameStop whirlwind. That said, on a larger timeframe, the King Crypto's trajectory evoked more optimism. Since the last meme stock mania in Jan. 2021, Bitcoin has gained 91%, even breaching its previous peak earlier this year. GameStop, on the other hand, entered a multi-year decline and was unable to break through its prior highs. It was still trading 38% lower than its peak. Why It Matters: GameStop’s trajectory displayed brief, sharp surges brought on by social media events, but Bitcoin exhibited consistency over the years, bolstering its use case as a store of value asset.While the sustainability of GameStop's surge will be evident in the next few days, Bitcoin's growing mainstream penetration spurred by the launch of spot ETFs would mean a more stable ascent, away from wild fluctuations.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $61,908.40, following a 1.14% drop in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: DOGE Is The First Crypto GME Folks Are Likely To Buy,’ Touts Trader That Turned 5 Figures Into 8 Figures With Meme Coins
