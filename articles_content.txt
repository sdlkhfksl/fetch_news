Small creditors put at risk by latest FTX bankruptcy development

A significant claim against FTX EU — previously known as K-DNA Financial Services —has been transferred to FTXcreditor in the latest development in the FTX bankruptcy case. The transfer has the potential to accelerate all further proceedings but also presents risks to smaller creditors.According to the documents filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on May 15, the claim is part of the ongoing Chapter 11 proceedings previously held against FTX EU. The transfer was conducted under the rules required by the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, particularly Rule 3001(e)(2), which deals with claims transfers:"Seller hereby waives any notice or hearing requirements imposed by Rule 3001 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, and stipulates that an order may be entered recognizing this Evidence of Transfer of Claim as an unconditional assignment and Buyer as the valid owner of the claim.”The move is a strategic attempt to simplify the administrative processes of the bankruptcy case by consolidating all claims under a single creditor. Though this has the potential to expedite the case toward a conclusion, it does present a risk to smaller creditors. Due to the single-point of entry to claims through the company, smaller creditors could be overshadowed in favor of larger creditors — receiving less or less favorable terms.The new single claim holder, FTXcreditor, is represented by Michael Bottjer; however, the transferor’s identity remains confidential at this time.“To protect the identity of the Transferor, Transferee has not disclosed the Transferor’s name or address, and has not attached the signed Evidence of Transfer to this Notice of Transfer of Claim.”The lack of transparency could raise questions about the handling of the bankruptcy process amid this consolidatory process — exposing risks for manipulation where claim transfer identities remain shrouded behind anonymity.Related: Post-FTX crypto industry needs education before regulation: Former Biden advisor After filing for bankruptcy in November 2022, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX faced sudden financial downturns, which have had lasting consequences for all affected creditors. Since then, regulations — particularly in the U.S. — have honed in on cryptocurrencies in an attempt to assert more controls and ensure investor safety. This latest development in the case follows a recent development from FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who maintained his innocence after his 25-year jail sentence. In an interview on May 9, Bankman-Fried described his experience, explaining that he had been living on beans and rice — the latter becoming what he called “one of the currencies of the realm inside.”Related: Circle shifts legal home to US ahead of IPO

FLOKI Follows PEPE, Gains 18% on Binance Listing in Thailand - DailyCoin


        
Binance Thailand lists FLOKI, igniting a double-digit bull breakout.



Thailand made it to the Top 10 list through national crypto adoption.



Analysts find key similarities in FLOKI & PEPE’s performance.
The Viking-themed meme coin Floki (FLOKI) expands its audience to Thailand. The crypto-friendly country bolsters clear regulation and a 12% adoption rate, according to the 2023 Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Index, calculated by Chainalysis.
The move by Binance’s subsidiary in Thailand opens the door for FLOKI crypto to a 69 million audience, 10 million of whom already employ blockchain for their everyday deeds. Binance Thailand is regulated by the Ministry of Finance and supervised by Thailand’s Office of Securities and Exchange Commission.As Thai people are known to use cryptocurrency payments for everyday transactions, FLOKI crypto joins a list of popular altcoins like Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Ether (ETH) to trade against the Thai Baht (THB). Following the news, FLOKI picked up 13.3% daily gains, proceeding the weekly bull run to an 18% 7-day profit.FLOKI Following PEPE’s Path to Glory?Among Floki’s crypto meme coin’s meme coin peers, PEPE recently stood out as the biggest gainer, claiming $4.8 billion in market capitalization. While Floki’s historical price movements correlate highly with Pepe, Floki’s global market cap is over two times smaller, currently at $1,955,788,722.Many crypto analysts believe a lower market cap gives FLOKI more room to grow. For instance, crypto trader Rise To The Moon forecasts a $20 billion market cap for FLOKI sometime in the next bull run. In such a case, FLOKI crypto could throw the gauntlet to Dogecoin (DOGE) for the top dog’s status.As of press time, FLOKI is exchanging hands at $0.0002172, according to CoinGecko. Knocking on the doors of crypto’s TOP 50 by global market cap, Floki is now 39% up monthly, while the yearly return skyrocketed to 508.2%. Meanwhile, PEPE soared by 545.8% during the same time frame.On the Flipside
One key difference between the competing meme coins, FLOKI and PEPE, is the market depth and on-chain liquidity.



According to the combined liquidity books, Pepe’s daily trading volume was five times larger than Floki’s, encompassing $2.7B and $574M, respectively.
Why This MattersThe meme coin season is witnessing a comeback after GameStop’s rejuvenated stocks emerged on Wall Street, serving a double-digit boost for the meme sector.

Roaring Kitty crypto, AMC rally amid GameStop buzz: 'Sell, sell, sell' - AMBCrypto



Roaring Kitty crypto and AMC surged amid the market downturn.
Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton questions ethics of market manipulation via social media.

On the 14th of May, while Bitcoin [BTC] and other leading cryptocurrencies were bleeding, shares of GameStop [GME] and AMC Entertainment Holdings [AMC] were surging.
Reportedly, GME and AMC skyrocketed by 75% and 89%, respectively. 
This dramatic shift also triggered a meme coin frenzy, with several meme coins showing substantial gains. 
For instance, Roaring Kitty [ROAR] jumped by 175%, and the Wall Street Bets token surged by an astonishing 1,121% against the U.S. dollar. 
Execs weighs in 
Strangely, Jim Cramer, host of the CNBC television show “Mad Money” had quite a unique perspective on the situation.
Known for his aggressive investment strategies, Cramer in a recent stream at CNBC said, 
“I can’t see Gamestop, $GME, trading at $64 or even $44 and so, the responsible move is to sell, sell, sell.”  
Well, he didn’t stop there and while quoting AMC he noted, 
“$AMC is like a dead man walking.” 
The surge in GME and AMC shares began with Roaring Kitty’s return on social media on the 13th of May and has persisted with minimal pullback. 
This highlights the power of social media and the strong influence of key figures in the online trading community.
The role of social media
This scenario mirrors instances where Elon Musk influenced Dogecoin’s price through his public statements in the past.
All this brings us to a question — should such market manipulation be considered legal? 
Expressing disappointment on the same, Former SEC Chair, Jay Clayton in a recent conversation with CNBC said, 
“It bothers me on many levels— It’s a lot closer to gambling than trading and it is certainly not investing.” 
Questioning the entire situation at play, Clayton added, 
“Is a Tweet really investment advice? We’ve learned over the last five years that a Tweet is not investment advice.”
Good day for Solana meme coins 
Despite such criticism, Solana [SOL] meme coins have experienced a significant surge.
Notably, Dogwifhat [WIF], Bonk [BONK], and Popcat [POPCAT] have benefited from the positive trends currently observed in SOL meme coins.
As we move forward into the week, it will be interesting to see how things unfold and what the future holds for the meme coin industry.

Here's Why Polkadot's (DOT) Recent Price Crash Could be Good News: Analyst


																TL;DR

Despite recent price declines, analysts predict a potential rally for Polkadot (DOT), with some suggesting it could reach significant highs in the near future.
Key crypto figures remain optimistic about the token’s long-term growth, endorsing the strategy of accumulating during dips for substantial future gains.


Where is DOT Headed?
The price of Polkadot (DOT) has been on a downfall in the past weeks, plunging by 8% on a monthly scale and currently trading at around $6.50 (per CoinGecko’s data).

DOT Price, Source: CoinGecko

Despite the negative trends as of late, some analysts believe a resurgence is in the cards. The X user with over 100,000 followers – FLASH – thinks the recent price retreat could be “a textbook correction” that will eventually be replaced by a rally towards the $20 mark. “$5 level during summer hole bleedout could be attractive,” they assumed.
For their part, Crypto Thanos highlighted DOT’s potential to enter into a bull mode soon. The analyst suggested that the asset’s descending parallel channel is about to breakout, asking investors if they have already bought the dip.
Crypto Tony chipped in, too, envisioning a rally once DOT reclaims the critical resistance level of $7.50. He also advised investors to jump on the bandwagon as soon as the asset reaches that mark. 




Previous Forecasts
Michael van de Poppe and CRYPTOWZRD are among the numerous additional analysts who outlined DOT price predictions. The former presented himself as a huge fan of Polkadot, praised the protocol’s “fundamental progress “ over the years, and jumped on the bandwagon as an investor. CRYPTOWZRD claimed the asset is poised for a “volcanic eruption brewing“ should it surpass the important resistance zone of $9.60.
Most recently, the X user Dippy.eth described DOT as “the sleeping giant“ which is ready to skyrocket by 60% in the short run and much more substantially in the long term:
“For price targets short term min 60% higher. But for bull run targets they are much higher (couple of Xs). Accumulating on dips is a good strategy as DOT could be seeing new highs when the altseason fully commences.”

GameStop Crashed 30%. Is the Roaring Kitty Rally Over? - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsAfter two surreal days of spectacular gains, it looks like GameStop is finally crashing back down to reality.On Wednesday, GameStop stock (GME) crashed some 30% in the market’s opening minutes, to $34.12 as of this writing.That slippage wiped away a major chunk of the remarkable rally enjoyed by the stock this week, which began on Sunday when Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty—the meme stock influencer who architected GME’s Reddit-fueled short squeeze in 2021—appeared to return online after years of silence.Still, today’s crash has yet to wipe out the full extent of GME’s recent gains. The Nasdaq has already been automatically halted GME trading six times before 11 a.m. EST, according to NasdaqTrader.Before Roaring Kitty’s apparent return, on Friday, GameStop closed at $17.39. The influencer’s resurfacing brought the stock as high as $64.83 yesterday—an almost 4x increase from last week’s close. It’s not an unheard of gain in crypto, but it’s highly unusual on Wall Street.Some lucky traders may have walked away with millions thanks to GME’s roller coaster ride—assuming they stayed in long enough and got out in time. One trader who invested $27,000 in GME call contracts on April 24 that expire Friday, would have made $2 million off the trade.Roaring Kitty’s supposed return (the influencer has only posted GIFs and memes to Gill’s Twitter account, and hasn’t otherwise verified his identity) has also lifted other assets related to his former exploits—though those charms appear to be wearing off as well.AMC, another meme stock once favored by the influencer, is also down 30% today, to $4.82 at writing (the stock hit $11.90 at one point on Tuesday). And GME, a Solana meme coin inspired by the GameStop short squeeze saga, is down 23.9% in the last 24 hours, after surging yesterday to an all-time high.Today it's Floki Inu (FLOKI) that's been leading the meme coin pack. Earlier today the token, inspired by Elon Musk's pet Shiba Inu dog, was showing 24-hour gains of 17%, according to CoinGecko data. It's an interesting outcome because some of the messages sent by Gill in the past couple days included a video that says “the dog days are over.”Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

                        Game and 3D world builder Crucible has announced the Emergence Marketplace, set for launch this Summer.According to the press release shared with Cryptonews, the novel 3D on-chain marketplace will be unique in the industry – it will focus on interoperable assets with high utility.“This means that players will be able to use what they purchase across games and worlds,” it said.Users can already sign up for early access and allow lists.Once launched, the marketplace users will be able to own, transport, share, create, trade, and sell their assets while maintaining full control over them.Emergence Marketplace is ‘Culmination of Extensive Development’
Emergence Marketplace is developed as a product of the Open Meta Association, a community of creators, game developers, and players focused on constructing and advancing the Open Metaverse.The Association was formed in collaboration with Crucible Networks to build the Open Meta DAO and the Emergence protocol.Meanwhile, Crucible itself was founded in 2018, aiming to create the tools, marketplaces, and interfaces to facilitate an Open Metaverse.Its Emergence SDK (software development kit) for game developers for popular game engines Unreal and Unity has been downloaded over 55,000 times.“Emergence Marketplace represents the culmination of extensive research and development and builds upon the success of the Emergence SDK,” the team said.Source: CrucibleNow, the new marketplace will provide creators with tools to show their work and will extend tools for developers.Furthermore, both creators and developers will gain new opportunities, channels for engaging communities, and “ways of working,” the team said.Fully Native On-Chain 3D Marketplace
Emergence has proven to be a success, said the announcement.Providing a comprehensive ‘full stack’ of developer tools that work in game engines, Emergence is “quickly growing to become the “hub” that brings together players, creators, collectors, and developers.”The addition of the Marketplace will also provide a hub for players and collectors.Furthermore, it will provide utility and rewards to its members for contributing to the open future by playing, creating, or developing.According to Ryan Gill, Founder and CEO of Crucible, “the gaming industry has established a solid, sustainable business model with 3D assets,” but “almost none of them are on-chain.”Additionally, there has been innovation over the past few years in NFT marketplaces, but these haven’t made much progress with 3D.“Now, with Emergence, we’re bridging that gap, by building a fully native 3D marketplace that’s on-chain,” Gill said.Source: CrucibleAs noted, the marketplace will focus on interoperable assets with high utility.Open Meta’s Aleissia Laidacker (who previously led the Technology, Gameplay, and AI Direction on some large game franchises such as Assassin’s Creed at Ubisoft) commented that interoperability and utility are buzzwords and may sound technical.However, they refer to player choice, she said. Interoperability, coupled with the blockchain, “means that players truly have the right to own their assets instead of just ‘renting’ them from some big platform.”

CryptoQuant Analyst Announces the Altcoin to Follow in the Bull Market: "It Left Bitcoin and Its Rivals Behind!" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin surged after the SEC approved spot ETFs in January.
However, there are some altcoins that have surpassed even BTC with their rise. One of these altcoins was Toncoin (TON).


Analyzing Toncoin's performance, CryptoQuant analyst said that TON has outperformed Bitcoin by 118% since the beginning of 2024, outperforming other popular layer one chains (L1).
Stating that TON and BNB, two of the popular layer 1 blockchains, are two altcoins that managed to significantly outperform Bitcoin in 2024, the analyst said that TON is a cryptocurrency worth watching in the bull cycle.





Stating that behind this tremendous performance of TON is an active and strong community with the support of Telegram, the analyst said that TON is in an upward trend against both USD and BTC:

“Since the beginning of 2024, TON has outperformed Bitcoin by 118%, while other popular layer-one chains have struggled to find strength.
One of my favorite ways to invest in altcoins is to identify which projects have a positive trend against both USD and bitcoin values.
Of the main layer 1 blockchains, TON and BNB are the only assets that have managed to meaningfully outperform Bitcoin this year.
In my opinion, TON's relative strength against Bitcoin combined with Telegram's network effect makes it a cryptocurrency worth watching this bull run. “

Samson Mow Slams Ripple for Spreading FUD About Bitcoin and Tether, Ripple Files Motion to Seal Documents, Here's Why Ethereum ETF Could Be Denied: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


Don’t miss anything in the world of crypto with U.Today’s top three crypto news stories over the past day.Bitcoiner Samson Mow slams Ripple for spreading FUD about Bitcoin and TetherFollowing the confrontation that unfolded between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, Samson Mow, head of Jan3, took to social media to share his view on the situation. In his X post, Mow sided with Ardoino, writing that Ripple is now “actively spreading FUD about Tether” in order to “try and get traction on their own stablecoin.” The Jan3 CEO added that such a turn of events is not surprising for him at all, as a similar situation happened in 2022; back then, Ripple (particularly its cofounder Chris Larsen) paid $5 million to Greenpeace to start a campaign against Bitcoin, which aimed to force the change of BTC's proof-of-work consensus algorithm to a proof-of-stake one.SEC v. Ripple: Defendant files motion to seal documentsAccording to a recent update on the Ripple-SEC legal battle provided by defense lawyer James K. Filan, Ripple has filed a motion to seal or narrowly tailor some of its documents in connection with the SEC's motion for judgment and remedies. As stated by Ripple, if these confidential documents were made public, its business interests would suffer "significant harm." The company wants to seal or redact highly confidential information concerning its earnings, revenues expenses and so on. Additionally, Ripple requests to keep its contractual agreements with thirty-party business partners undisclosed; even though the company acknowledges the relevance of the fact that it provided institutional XRP buyers with discounts, it is unwilling to reveal the specific financial and pricing details. Besides, Ripple wishes to protect the identities of certain nonparty financial institutions - customers as well as employees.Here's why Ethereum ETF could be deniedIn a recent X post, James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, stated that the SEC's decision to deny numerous Ethereum ETF applications this May by stating that Ethereum is a security is becoming increasingly likely. “Not a guarantee that they will do this but I think this almost guarantees that the SEC is at least considering it,” Seyffart added. The analyst's post comes as a response to finance lawyer Scott Johnsson, who claimed that the SEC is considering the security question for Ethereum in its next spot ETF order. Per Johnsson, the regulator is supposed to provide a "notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration." The SEC argues that since the underlying asset is a security, it was improper to offer commodity-based trust shares. Interestingly, Bitcoin ETFs did not have to deal with this issue. As a reminder, on May 23 and 24, the SEC is expected to make its final decision about VanEck and ARK's Ethereum ETF filings, respectively.

Bitcoin (BTC) Gains 4% on Easing US Inflation Data - DailyCoin


        

The Bitcoin price has climbed in hopes of a relaxed monetary policy.



Lower-than-expected inflation figures have triggered optimism in the crypto market.



The possibility of a Fed rate cut this summer has been put back on the table.




Cryptocurrency markets reacted positively to signs of slowing inflation in the United States on Wednesday. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surged over 4% to $64,500 following the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed a slight decrease in inflation compared to March.



Lower-Than-Expected Inflation Bumps Bitcoin



This news offered a glimmer of hope for cryptocurrency investors who had been bracing for a prolonged period of high interest rates. Throughout 2023, inflation consistently dipped, leading many, including the Federal Reserve, to anticipate a more relaxed monetary policy in 2024. However, inflation has unexpectedly risen slightly this year, dampening hopes for immediate rate cuts.




The Wednesday CPI report indicated a 0.3% monthly increase in inflation, lower than the 0.4% recorded in March and economist predictions. Year-over-year inflation also showed a slight decline, reaching 3.4% compared to March’s 3.5%. Core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, followed a similar trend with a 0.3% monthly increase and a year-over-year rise of 3.6%.



These figures, while still concerning, were enough to trigger a positive response in the crypto market. Bitcoin, which had been under pressure due to the prospect of sustained high interest rates, saw a significant price jump. The spot Bitcoin ETF, a potential catalyst for further growth, has been sidelined recently due to slowed or even reversed inflows.



Fed Rate Cut Back on the Table?



Before the CPI report, the possibility of a Fed rate cut this summer was considered unlikely, with traders only pricing in a 50% chance of a move by September. However, the easing inflation data could shift this outlook, potentially leading to a more accommodative monetary policy in the latter half of the year.



The positive reaction extended beyond the crypto market. Traditional markets also responded favorably to the softer inflation and economic data. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%, and the 10-year Treasury yield dropped to 4.37%. The U.S. dollar index weakened by 0.5%, and gold prices gained 0.7%.




While the long-term trajectory of inflation and interest rates remains uncertain, the latest data provides a welcome respite for cryptocurrency investors. The easing of inflation concerns could pave the way for a more bullish crypto market in the coming months.



On the Flipside




While the monthly inflation decrease is positive, year-over-year inflation is still at 3.4%, exceeding the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%.



The 10-year Treasury yield dropped slightly, indicating that a short-term trend might not convince investors to expect future inflation adjustments.



Core CPI, excluding volatile items, remains at 3.6%, which might be a more relevant indicator for long-term inflation expectations.




Why This Matters



This dip in inflation offers a potential turning point for the crypto market. A shift towards a more relaxed Federal Reserve policy, with lower interest rates on the horizon, could significantly improve investor sentiment and lead to a broader market rally. This could breathe new life into stalled projects and potentially attract new capital to the cryptocurrency space.

Bitcoin Miners Are Selling Again, Can BTC Price Hold $60,000? | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin is still holding steady above the $60,000 price mark, but recent actions by miners could disturb this stability very soon. The recent halving cut the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, meaning miners now receive half as much for verifying transactions and mining new blocks. As noted in a recent report by Kaiko, miner revenues have plummeted since the halving, and miners are beginning to feel the pressure. 
Bitcoin Under Increased Pressure
Bitcoin miners largely rely on two revenue streams to keep operating: the mining reward and transaction fees. The Bitcoin market is cyclical and each halving has historically led to an increase in selling pressure from the miners. Data shows that the recent April halving has led to a fall in the Bitcoin hash rate with mining profitability now at its lowest point in three years.

For miners with high operating costs, this drastic mining pay cut means they have to find other ways to generate income and fund their business. For many, the only option is to sell some of the BTC they hold. According to findings, Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms, two of the biggest Bitcoin miners, currently hold BTC worth over $1.6 billion between them.
Interestingly, the spike in Bitcoin network fees before and after the halving has mostly offset operational costs and compelled the need to sell. According to Kaiko, network fees accounted for 16% of BTC earned by Marathon Digital in April, a jump from 4.5% in March. 
However, the recent trading activity and volume decline in the past few days means revenue from the network fees is dropping and the likelihood of miners selling their holdings is increasing. 
Source: Kaiko
What’s Next For BTC?
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $61,888 and is on a 1.20% decrease in the past 24 hours. The next three to six months will be crucial in determining how much the halving and miner selling impacts the Bitcoin price. If demand remains strong and most large miners can weather the revenue drop without selling too many of their holdings, the price could hold steady and even start to climb.

Fortunately, there are still a lot of catalysts for price surges that could offset the looming selloff from miners. Hence, Bitcoin has a good chance of defending the $60,000 price level. An example is the mainstream adoption of BTC through Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Some Bitcoin whales are also taking advantage of the price consolidation to top up their holdings. On-chain data shows that short-term holder whales are now accumulating around 200,000 BTC per week.

It’s time for Congress to protect the crypto henhouse - Blockworks


We find ourselves in a strange interregnum for crypto policy in the United States. 
On one side, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler is ramping up an all-out war against the crypto industry, accelerating enforcement actions and saber-rattling, perhaps in anticipation of being replaced after November’s elections. The aim seems straightforward: Let’s do as much damage to crypto while we have the chance. 
On the other side, a growing bipartisan group in Congress is working, ploddingly, towards new crypto-focused legislation in an acknowledgment that the current status quo is untenable. 
The slow and steady legislative pace gives Chair Gensler the chance to be the fox in the crypto henhouse while our lawmakers are occupied with other jobs on the farm. 
The insatiable campaign against crypto undermines the work that Congress has done so far to address crypto’s long-standing regulatory quagmire. It’s time the farmers regain control and flush the fox out.
Indeed, Congress has made notable progress towards addressing key regulatory issues, even if their efforts remain imperfect and incomplete. Some of the pieces of draft legislation could prove a net positive for the crypto ecosystem with considered revisions. Rep. Patrick McHenry and Rep. Maxine Waters’ yet-to-be-released stablecoin bill has garnered decent bipartisan support and could reach a House floor vote this session. McHenry’s FIT21 bill on crypto market structure is headed for a full-House vote at the end of May.  
Just last week, a bipartisan House coalition repealed the SEC’s punitive SAB 121 accounting rules for crypto — a clear rebuke of Gensler’s aggressive tactics, and a sign there is Congressional appetite to move quicker than the typical glacial speed they are accustomed to with core crypto issues. 
These moves demonstrate that lawmakers at least seem to grasp that if they don’t act soon to rein in Gensler’s crusade, they may end up protecting just a rump of what was once a vibrant American crypto industry.
What is to be done? Congress faces two key constraints: It’s an election year when major legislative lifts are difficult, and they must consolidate enough bipartisan consensus to push comprehensive crypto legislation over the finish line.
Fortunately, new polling indicates growing public engagement on the crypto issue which could provide productive tailwinds. 
According to a recent Harris Poll, most voters don’t trust elected officials to understand innovative technologies like crypto, and over half are concerned about policymakers stifling innovation through heavy-handed regulation. Those sentiments are warning lights for the SEC and are opportunities for members of Congress. Former President Trump’s recent overtures embracing crypto and courting crypto-aligned voters should also add impetus for Congressional action.
Read more from our opinion section: No, ETH isn’t suddenly a security now
Ultimately, lawmakers must recognize that an overzealous regulator is attempting to unilaterally decide the fate of an ecosystem that is vitally important to America’s future economic competitiveness and technological leadership. This circumvents the proper role of Congress in setting foundational rules, and our elected officials should reassert their prerogative rather than ceding that power to crypto’s most fervent detractors.
The clock is ticking. As election day approaches, the impetus for Chair Gensler to gobble up even more crypto hens will grow stronger. Our nation’s legislative farmers must return to the crucial task of protecting and catalyzing the homegrown crypto ecosystem. They’re close to drafting fit-for-purpose rules that would clarify how the government understands and regulates crypto, though much more work needs to be done. 
If they don’t move quickly, they may find the hen house empty and wonder why they didn’t act sooner.

Grok Army Suggests Potential Reason for OpenAI Cofounder's Resignation, But There's a Catch


An insider from the Dogecoin and X teams who calls himself “DogeDesigner” (@cb_doge) has caught the attention of the community of Grok supporters with his tweet about the top executives who suddenly began resigning from xAI’s main rival, OpenAI.Earlier, the news of the company’s cofounder, Ilya Sutskever, made waves in the tech community. Later, it became known that another high-ranking team member of OpenAI sent in his resignation.The community and Dogecoin founder suggested a reason why this may be happening. While Billy Markus expressed hope, the rest of the Grok community seemed to be just making fun of the situation.Here's hypothetical reason why "everyone leaving OpenAI"@cb_doge tweeted a rhetorical question: “Why is everyone leaving OpenAI?” By this he meant not only cofounder Ilya Sutskever but also Jan Leike, co-leading "superalignment" at the same company.Earlier today, Leike tweeted that he has called it quits with OpenAI after Sutskever’s announcement on X. The Grok community began suggesting to @cb_doge reasons as to why these resignations are taking place all of a sudden. The main reason that they jokingly suggested was “because of Grok.” One of the Dogecoin cofounders, Billy Markus, tweeted that he hopes Ilya Sutskever will decide to join the xAI team after leaving OpenAI.DOGE cofounder criticizes ChatGPT-4oAs reported earlier, Markus, known on the X platform as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, shared his disappointment at the most recent upgrade made by OpenAI to its ChatGPT product. The company recently rolled out GPT-4o. The creator of the original meme cryptocurrency, DOGE, tested the updated product and shared the results of his experiments.Markus set ChatGPT-4o the task of creating a funny meme, and then making it “even funnier,” then 10x funnier and so on. The result proved to be discouraging for him as he tweeted that none of those images made him laugh.The Dogecoin creator is known as a fan of xAI’s Grok AI and of Elon Musk, the owner of the X platform. Frequently, he comments on Musk’s tweets, providing support to the innovative tech entrepreneur.

China busts $2 billion USDT money laundering operation


Police in China have announced the dismantling of a large underground banking gang accused of facilitating illegal transactions with almost $2 billion worth of tether (USDT).
Sichuan and Chongqing authorities said on Tuesday that 193 suspects across 26 Chinese provinces have been arrested as a result of the operation. 
According to local media, the gang allegedly used USDT to evade China’s foreign exchange regulations and provide a means for criminals to send their funds overseas, transacting 13.8 billion yuan ($1.9 billion).

Two ‘dens’ in Fujian and Hunan belonging to the gang were reportedly destroyed by authorities in 2023 and 149 million yuan ($20.6 million) of funds linked to the gang were frozen as part of the case. 
The gang’s illegal foreign exchange reportedly committed “financial fraud, job-related crimes, obstruction of drug management, smuggling of goods prohibited by the state…. obstruction of credit card management, defrauding export tax refunds and other criminal activities.”
USDT has also been used to pay gold smugglers in Nepal shifting 33kg of the precious metal into the country before returning to Tibet with sacks of cash, musk, and medicinal caterpillar fungus called yarsagumba.
Additionally, the United Nations claims that USDT is at the heart of a ‘parallel banking system’ created by organized crime in Southeast Asia. It said in a report, “Online gambling platforms, and especially those that are operating illegally, have emerged as among the most popular vehicles for cryptocurrency-based money launderers, particularly for those using Tether or USDT on the TRON25 blockchain.”

Bitcoin Boom Sparks Surge In Crypto Wallet Recovery Services: 'It's Just Pure Economics' - Benzinga

As the Bitcoin BTC/USD price continues to surge, investors who have lost access to their accounts are turning to crypto wallet recovery firms in droves.What Happened: The increase in bitcoin prices has led to a spike in calls to wallet recovery services, Reuters reported on Wednesday. These calls are primarily from retail investors who have lost access to their digital wallets where their cryptocurrencies are stored. This loss of access is often due to forgotten passwords or loss of access to two-factor authentication devices.Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers., said, “What would be driving this trend is the fact that bitcoin prices are at $60,000, not $30,000… it’s just pure economics.”A Swiss firm that uses Nvidia’s graphic processing unit cards to run AI models to access stranded wallets saw a tenfold increase in requests in the first quarter, compared to the same period last year. Similarly, Germany-based ReWallet reported a 334% increase in requests in the previous quarter. These services are not cheap, with firms charging a 20% fee on the wallets’ contents, payable only upon successful retrieval. However, the high price of bitcoin seems to be incentivizing investors to recover their lost access.See Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Under Pressure From Macro Data: ‘Healthy Corrections Are Part Of The Game,’ Says TraderWhy It Matters: The recent surge in Bitcoin prices can be attributed to a number of factors. Bitcoin has been maintaining the $60,000 support level, a stability that has been sustained since early May. This stability, coupled with the reimbursement of customers by FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, has likely boosted investor confidence. However, the recent slide in cryptocurrency markets following the release of April’s Producer Price Inflation (PPI) data serves as a reminder of the volatility of the sector.Price Action: At the time of writing the article, Bitcoin was trading 3.48% higher at $63,783.18 on Wednesday, according to Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Price And Sentiment Up, As Banks Disclose BTC Holdings: A ‘GME Moment’ ComingImage via Shutterstock

Forget memecoins, Bitcoin is driving the bull run - NBX Warsaw

Bitcoin, not memecoins, will continue to be a pivotal driving force in this bull run courtesy of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the influence of the halving. This was a key takeaway from day one of the Next Block Expo in Warsaw as prominent industry insiders unpacking major trends of the current market cycle. Bitcoin (BTC) remains a clear focal point and driver of sentiment midway through 2024, as four experts told Cointelegraph on stage.Cointelegraph's Gareth Jenkinson moderating the panel at Next Block Expo in Warsaw. Source: Simply StakingAdrian Zduńczyk, founder of the trading education platform The Birb Nest, said that historical data around previous halvings suggests significant upside for BTC into 2025.“From 2011 through to the peak of 2013, we observed a 9,000% growth in the price appreciation,” Zduńczyk said. Related: Bitcoin could top $100K but only if ‘high-yield rate’ falls below 7% — AnalystHighlighting that Bitcoin bullruns in 2017 and 2021 produced 3,000% and 700% gains respectively in the value of BTC, Zduńczyk said Bitcoin remains a core indicator of market performance:“Those are the facts. There's no way to refute that. Bitcoin halving history has brought a massive price rise. Hence relying on the facts, the data is very favorable.”Ben Yorke, ecosystem vice president at exchange platform WooX, also highlighted that there was no longer regulatory ambiguity around Bitcoin. Related: Bitcoin bottomed at $56K?

Regulatory green light is good for BitcoinCriticisms of Bitcoin’s utility are also being nullified as the proliferation of the Lightning network and other functionalities that allow a user to maintain full custody of their BTC. Yorke said that adoption of Bitcoin services like Lightning will ultimately quash these arguments.“For the last ten years, we've been building a lot of infrastructure with applications like Lightning. Once these applications take off, the utility naysayers will have very few places to hide.”Miko Matsumura, general partner of cryptocurrency asset fund Gumi Crypto, echoed these sentiments, suggesting that the development of infrastructure to improve the ability to use Bitcoin for payments would be an additional driver of capital into the ecosystem.Zduńczyk added that the timing of regulatory greenlights of Bitcoin ETFs reflected the seasonality of investment cycles, with summer months often driving market performance of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq:“The ETFs nicely aligned because there was demand from the institutions and there was a legal infrastructure. All those big pension funds, all the central banks that are actually entering the space from 2025 onward.”Zduńczyk also highlighted historical trends around U.S. presidential elections driving up performance of traditional markets spilling over into Bitcoin in years past. Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

Stablecoin Market Cools in May as Bulls Seek Signs of Revival - DailyCoin


        

The cryptocurrency market has been subdued in May. Bitcoin has failed to capitalize on halving hype so far.



Analysts have been divided on whether there will be a summer slump or a bullish resurgence.



Stablecoin activity has revealed reduced investor confidence, but a recent influx has sparked hope.




The cryptocurrency market has experienced a subdued May so far, with Bitcoin (BTC) failing to capitalize on the momentum of the earlier halving event. While some analysts predict a summer of consolidation, others remain cautiously optimistic, looking for indicators of a potential bullish resurgence.




This month, Bitcoin faced downward pressure, with altcoins mirroring the trend. Memecoins, known for their volatility and community-driven hype, were a rare exception, managing some gains. However, the broader market sentiment leaned bearish.



Stablecoins Offer Clues to Investor Behavior



Analysts turned to stablecoin activity to gauge investor sentiment. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, are often used as a safe haven during market downturns. Examining on-chain data from CryptoQuant, the focus was placed on two key metrics: active addresses and exchange reserves.



Chart Showing the Total Number of Unique Active Addresses. Source: CryptoQuant.



The number of unique active stablecoin addresses, which tracks both sending and receiving activity, has been trending downward since mid-April. This mirrors a similar pattern observed in February and March when a surge in active addresses coincided with a strong market rally that saw Bitcoin break the $70,000 barrier. 



The recent decline suggests reduced trading activity, potentially indicating a lack of bullish conviction among investors. Exchange reserves, representing stablecoins held on exchanges, offer another glimpse into investor behavior. 



While these reserves have mostly consolidated throughout 2024, a sharp drop from late April to mid-May highlighted a decline in buying power. This implies that stablecoin holders were less inclined to convert their holdings into other crypto assets during this period.



Chart Showing All Stablecoin Reserves on Exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant.



However, a recent influx of stablecoins onto exchanges on May 13 offered a potential sign of renewed buying interest. If this trend continues, it could be seen as a positive development for bulls.



Tether Dominance: A Signal for Bulls or Bears?



The dominance of Tether (USDT), the leading stablecoin, offers another data point. The Tether Dominance chart tracks USDT’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. An upward trend in this metric indicates a preference for holding stablecoins, which can be interpreted as investors staying on the sidelines. 



Conversely, a downtrend often accompanies market rallies. Currently, Tether Dominance is positioned above a key support level. While a move toward the resistance level is anticipated, a drop below this support could be a bullish signal. 



However, thorough technical and fundamental analysis of individual crypto assets remains crucial for informed investment decisions beyond relying solely on Tether Dominance. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the direction of the cryptocurrency market. 



On the Flipside




Stablecoin data only reflects a portion of investor sentiment. It doesn’t account for investors holding other assets.



The gains seen in memecoins might be temporary and unrelated to the broader market trend. They can be highly susceptible to social media hype and unpredictable swings.




Why This Matters



This article offers valuable insight into investor sentiment by analyzing stablecoin activity and Tether dominance. A resurgence in stablecoin trading and a drop in Tether dominance could signal a return of bullish momentum in the broader cryptocurrency market, potentially leading to a breakout from the current subdued phase.

Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Form Capitulation Signal: What It Means


																On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons have recently gone through a crossover. Here’s what it could mean for the cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Suggest Miner Capitulation Is On
As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a Quicktake post, miners are capitulating right now if the Hash Ribbons indicator is to be believed. This on-chain metric is generally used to determine whether miners are in distress.
BTC runs on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism where miners play the role of validators and compete against each other using computing power to get a chance to add the next block to the chain.
This computing power, when measured across the network, can provide insight into the health of the miners as a whole. Due to this reason, the Hash Ribbons indicator makes use of this total Bitcoin “Hashrate” to judge the situation of the miners.

	Related Reading



Naturally, a rise in the Hashrate suggests the network is attracting miners right now, while a decline could imply low profitability is making some of these validators pull out from BTC.
The Hash Ribbons indicator uses two moving averages (MA) of the Hashrate, 30-day and 60-day, to represent whether these behaviors are particularly intense or not at the moment. When the 30-day ribbon moves under the 60-day one, it suggests that miners are mass capitulating. On the other hand, the opposite cross suggests network is observing growth again.
Now, what relevance do these trends have for Bitcoin? According to Charles Edwards, the creator of the Hash Ribbons, the miners have historically been quite resilient, and they only quit when things get especially bad for the cryptocurrency. As such, the market may be more likely to approach a bottom whenever these chain validators show capitulation.
Below is a chart that shows how the miners’ behaviour has looked recently according to this indicator:
Looks like the two ribbons have gone through a cross recently | Source: CryptoQuant
As Maartunn has highlighted in the graph, the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons have seen a crossover recently. More specifically, the cross has involved the 30-day moving under the 60-day, implying that the miners are capitulating.
Miner profits come down to three factors: BTC spot price, transaction fees, and electricity costs in the area that they are located in. Historically, the fees has been quite low in comparison to the block rewards, so miner financials have been dependent on the price (as the block rewards only have this variable attached to them) and electricity prices.
Recently, the BTC price has been stuck in consolidation while the block rewards have been slashed in half in the latest Halving event. This has led to tightening revenues for these chain validators, so it’s not surprising to see that the miners with the least efficient machines have already started ditching the network in hordes.

In the chart, past instances of miner capitulation are shown with the green lines. It’s visible that while miner capitulation has generally indeed occurred near profitable buying points into the asset, these bottoms haven’t immediately appeared after the crossovers have occurred. As the analyst notes, “It unfolds in the subsequent days and weeks after less efficient miners throw in the towel.”

Bitcoin’s price touched the $65,000 barrier, trading at $64,961.60 as of 11:38 AM ET on May 15, 2024, representing a over 5% increase over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s upward trajectory follows softer-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, signaling a positive market reaction to the latest inflation news. This surge has propelled Bitcoin to its highest levels since March 2024, when it achieved record highs surpassing $73,000.



CPI Data Eases Inflation Fears, Blosters Market Sentiment for Bitcoin



The release of the CPI data, which indicated a more stable inflationary environment, has bolstered market sentiment and contributed to Bitcoin’s recent price surge. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s suggestion that interest rates will not increase further has also provided a more favorable backdrop for Bitcoin investments. However, the cryptocurrency has faced downward pressure from regulatory threats and a decline in capital inflows into crypto investment products. Additionally, Bitcoin’s recent halving event, which reduced the per-block coin emission to 3.125 BTC, has influenced miner profitability and overall market dynamics.





CPI In Line with Expectations in April



The CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) rose by 0.3% in April 2024, a slight decrease from the 0.4% increase recorded in March. Year-over-year, the all-items index increased by 3.4%, aligning with economists’ expectations and marginally lower than the 3.5% rise seen in March. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, increased by 0.3% in April, consistent with forecasts but down from the 0.4% increase in March. The indexes for shelter and gasoline were the primary drivers of the monthly CPI increase, collectively accounting for more than 70% of the overall rise. 



The CPI is a crucial indicator of inflation, reflecting the cost of living and influencing the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. Stable or lower-than-expected CPI figures can alleviate market concerns about aggressive interest rate hikes, which typically hurt investment assets like Bitcoin. The April CPI data has raised hopes for potential Fed rate cuts, although current inflation levels and economic growth still warrant caution. Moreover, CPI data affects consumer confidence and spending patterns, which are critical for economic health and investment climates.



The Relationship Between Bitcoin and Inflation Data



Bitcoin’s price often responds to inflation data and monetary policy signals, as some investors perceive it as a hedge against inflation. Positive CPI data can lead to a stronger dollar and higher interest rates, potentially reducing Bitcoin’s appeal as an alternative investment. Conversely, softer inflation data, as observed in April 2024, can boost Bitcoin prices by lowering expectations of aggressive rate hikes, thus maintaining a more favorable investment environment.



In addition to CPI data, Bitcoin’s market behavior is influenced by broader economic indicators, such as retail sales and the Producer Price Index (PPI), which can provide early signals of inflation trends. Furthermore, regulatory developments and capital flows into cryptocurrency products further intertwine Bitcoin’s performance with inflation and economic policies.

Analyst Drops Bomb: Bitcoin Is A Better Investment Than MicroStrategy Stock


								Jim Cramer, the outspoken host of CNBC’s Mad Money, has caused a stir in the financial sector by endorsing Bitcoin (BTC) over MicroStrategy stock (MSTR). This recommendation follows despite MSTR’s notable year-to-date performance of 85%, compared to Bitcoin’s 125% gain.

Cramer’s endorsement, however, is met with a dose of skepticism. The financial guru is known for his sometimes-inaccurate predictions, with some even claiming his recommendations have the opposite effect – a phenomenon known as the “Inverse Cramer” theory.
MicroStrategy Doubles Down On Bitcoin
While Cramer throws shade at MicroStrategy, the company remains a staunch Bitcoin advocate. CEO Michael Saylor is a vocal “Bitcoin Maxi,” holding a significant personal stake in the cryptocurrency and spearheading the company’s hefty BTC acquisitions. This unwavering commitment stands in stark contrast to Cramer’s sudden shift.


Bitcoin ETF Outflows Cast A Shadow
Cramer’s advice also coincides with a period of uncertainty for Bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale, the largest Bitcoin ETF management company, has seen a recent exodus of investors due to fees associated with their product. Additionally, newly launched Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong have experienced more redemptions than deposits for several days, indicating a cautious investor sentiment.

Sell Pressure Dampens Bitcoin’s Momentum
Adding fuel to the fire, the Bitcoin market itself is facing headwinds. A recent price drop below $62,000 is accompanied by substantial sell pressure on spot markets, raising concerns about a potential downward trend.
Is The ‘Inverse Cramer’ Curse Upon Us?
With Cramer’s past record and the “Inverse Cramer” theory swirling, some investors might be hesitant to follow his current Bitcoin recommendation. If history repeats itself, his endorsement could unintentionally trigger a sell-off.

Cramer’s Comments: A Double-Edged Sword For Crypto Awareness
Despite the uncertainty surrounding his call, Cramer’s foray into the Bitcoin conversation has a silver lining. Discussions about cryptocurrency by prominent figures like Cramer can raise public awareness about blockchain technology, potentially attracting new investors to the digital asset space.

The Verdict: A Gamble In A Murky Market
Cramer’s sudden shift in stance towards Bitcoin leaves investors in a quandary. While Bitcoin offers higher potential returns than MicroStrategy stock, recent market trends and Cramer’s own track record suggest a degree of risk. Ultimately, the decision to invest in Bitcoin directly or through MicroStrategy remains a gamble in a currently murky market.

                        Wednesday, May 15, 2024 – Solana meme coin Slothana ($SLOTH) has been making new all-time highs as it pulls in buyers eager to take pole position for even bigger gains to come.Currently priced at $0.035, $SLOTH was trading as high as $0.0565 at the beginning of the week.Now bulls are targeting $0.10 for upside of 185% in the near term.If word on the crypto grapevine is correct, $SLOTH could easily surpass that price target, with meme coins continuing to outperform the rest of the crypto market – and Solana-based tokens are leading the way.Rumors of a top 10 centralized exchange listing is set to add to the momentum created by a token burn mechanism that has seen bulls charge into the $SLOTH market.The most recent $1 million burn led to a price pump shortly after the event news was posted on X.There are now more than 36,700 token holders of $SLOTH in self-custody wallets, not to mention a growing band of centralized exchanges (CEXs) clamoring to list the coin.Slothana burns $1m worth of Slothana when the price appreciates an additional cent, as set out in an X post on the 10th May, that has so far had 219k views as the excitement spreads.More whales poised to dive into the Slothana market as CEX listings grow
With early presale buyers sitting on gains of 3x, there has been predictable profit-taking by savvy buyers looking to book ROI.At the same time, the latest meme coin theme to sweep the market – the reignition of the meme stock craze – has seen some attention pulled away from other areas of the market.GME, KITTY and AMC have all seen stellar gains in recent days.However, the start of the European session has seen the first signs that this latest fad may be waning, which will likely help to refocus market participants’ interest on other areas of the meme coin space.Meme stock diversion notwithstanding, Slothana has still been a persistent trender in the hot top 10 pairs on Dextools and other trading sites.$SLOTH’s recent price momentum combined with what could be price-moving news flow around CEX listings means it is likely to see a new influx of whale traders imminently.This whale bought $47k (332 SOL) worth of $SLOTH earlier today – expect more of the same in the coming hours as the rumor mill takes hold:https://solscan.io/tx/3sJxTbLcqXCZMGrLbdhKdVCvjW5czdKfA1vhKrMSG1Du9LGwBByZRMyYU1wPXc4K5UTu82bjESDbiiqQizhAB62uPerhaps helping to spur listing rumors has been the organic listings that $SLOTH has been attracting as it broke through the $100 million market capitalization mark on Monday.Poloniex, XT.com and Bitrue centralized exchanges have all added the token to their trading venues in the past couple of days, turning on the taps for more volume to enter the SLOTH/SOL trading pair.$SLOTH trading at an inviting price for new money – don’t miss the next pump
Although $SLOTH is trading 28% lower today, as news of impending major listings start to swirl and, presumably, an announcement from the team is forthcoming, the price is set to rocket again. Take the current pullback as a breather and opportunity to either add to an existing position or open a new one.Trading volume is an exceedingly healthy $25 million at the time of writing.Meanwhile, volatility is increasing, providing even more opportunity for day traders, but also for those with the patience to allow the price to come to them rather than trying to catch a falling knife.Putting that another way, $SLOTH buy orders between today’s low of $0.026 and the current price around the $0.035 level, will likely be a good region to take advantage of a CEX-induced price acceleration to $0.10.Taking a position in the $0.030 area delivers a handsome risk-reward ratio of 5 if the price, as postulated here, reaches 0.01 in the near term (measured from a stop-loss of $0.016), defined as the next week or so, depending on CEX news flow timings.The DEXTools link can be found here.$SLOTH the next $WIF is in the vanguard of the Solana meme coin wave
In a measure of the interest in the project, Slothana raised $15 million in its recent presale, as the frenzy around SOL meme coins remains unabated.Tokens such as DogWifHat ($WIF), Bonk ($BONK), Book of Meme ($BOME) and Popcat ($POPCAT) have all done spectacularly well, and $SLOTH is on the cusp of joining their ranks.Ongoing presales for Dogeverse and Sealana are a further indication of the red-hot nature of the SOL meme coin marketplace.Slothana is in the vanguard of this movement and today’s price could well be the lowest crypto traders are ever likely to see.Keep up with the latest burns and other developments on Slothana’s X account and Telegram group.Buy SLOTH Here

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $100 billion market cap in the first half of 2024


Bitcoin (BTC) recent surge to a record high of $73,750, followed by a pullback to $61,000, has set the stage for what many in the cryptocurrency sector believe could be the onset of an altcoin season. Analysts’ diverse predictions hint at a massive upswing in altcoin valuations.
This ongoing bullish sentiment particularly benefits several cryptocurrencies on the verge of significant market cap milestones, notably the $100 billion mark. 
Consequently, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies likely to surpass this threshold.


BNB Chain (BNB)
BNB, the native token of Binance, is showing robust potential to reach and potentially exceed a $100 billion market cap. This potential is anchored in Binance’s continuous strategic expansions and innovative developments within its ecosystem.
Currently holding the fourth position in the crypto market by market cap, BNB boasts a valuation of approximately $85.6 billion and trades at $580.28, marking a 2% increase in the last 24 hours.

During this period, BNB has seen a trading volume exceeding $1.95 billion, a 12% increase, signaling renewed investor interest and confidence in its growth prospects.
Recent price fluctuations have led to a surge in liquidations across the BNB network. Over the past few days, positions worth over $20 million have been liquidated, with more than $1.15 million liquidated on May 14th alone. 
Despite these losses, traders remain optimistic about BNB’s long-term potential, as evidenced by the increasing number of long positions.
The BNB Chain ecosystem continues to grow, integrating 35 new decentralized applications (dApps) into its Web3 Wallet. This integration enhances BNB’s utility and demand, covering various sectors, including gaming, finance, and trading, thus increasing user engagement.
With a year-to-date price increase of 86% and a current market cap of approximately $85.5 billion, BNB requires a 14% increase to surpass the $100 billion threshold. Given the ongoing market growth and further platform expansions, this goal appears within reach.
Solana (SOL)
Solana (SOL), currently the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, stands at $68,472,570,217 and is backed by strong investor confidence. 
The Solana ecosystem has been vibrant, particularly with SOL-based meme coins like the WIF token and BONK seeing significant trading volume increases. These trends highlight growing investor interest and positively impact Solana’s market value.

Despite experiencing network outages, Solana maintains a solid market presence and trades above crucial support levels. The ecosystem is thriving, with a marked increase in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes and new projects enhancing its utility. 
Continuous network stability and scalability improvements are essential for maintaining investor confidence and supporting market cap growth.
Recently, Solana has outpaced Ethereum (ETH) in daily trading volumes, raising discussions about its potential to challenge Ethereum’s dominance. 
On May 12, Solana generated more transaction fees and Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) than Ethereum for the first time, although Ethereum’s total transaction fees remained higher at $1.82 million compared to Solana’s $1.19 million,
Solana needs a 41% increase to achieve a $100 billion market cap. Supported by strong fundamentals and the bullish market conditions following the Bitcoin halving, Solana’s trajectory looks promising. 
As of now, Solana is valued at $153.05, showing daily gains of nearly 6.6%
With a year-to-date price increase of 50.53%, Solana is on a robust growth path, driven by its technological advancements and expanding ecosystem.
Both BNB and Solana are strategically positioned to potentially achieve the $100 billion market cap milestone, driven by their ecosystem developments, technological enhancements, and the prevailing bullish sentiment in the market. 
However, the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market necessitates cautious investment. Investors should continuously monitor market trends and individual asset performance to capitalize on these opportunities effectively.

Bitcoin's Prospects Brighten Despite Recent Price Volatility After April's Halving

However, the retreat likely stemmed from macro factors, specifically hawkish comments by the Federal Reserve. These ignited a "risk-off" mentality as an interest rate cut became more unlikely in 2024, with a hike becoming possible. Since then, economic data has been weaker than expected, making a hike very unlikely for now. This shift has put the risk trade back on, setting an immediate floor in BTC prices, which have since recovered above $60,000. It also suggests a shift back to supply and demand factors for bitcoin, which appear favorable for higher prices.

Exploring Ethereum's Staking Expansion: Potential for Growth and Innovation

The next Ethereum upgrade, Pectra, will likely take place by the end of 2024, or in early 2025. One of the key proposals, EIP 7251, can provide a better UX for validators to earn staking yield. This proposal will increase the max effective balance of validators from 32 to 2048. Leading staking service providers, like Coinbase, are managing more than 130,000 validators already. The lift in maximum effective balance allows these providers to consolidate the number of validators and ultimately increase efficiency and lower the cost of operation.

Robinhood Rolls Out Solana Staking in Europe, Offering 5% APY


							

Robinhood Crypto introduces Solana staking in Europe with around 5% APY.



The feature is Robinhood’s first staking product, which chose Solana for its EU popularity.



Robinhood’s expansion of crypto services in Europe comes amid its U.S. regulatory scrutiny.




Prominent American trading platform Robinhood Crypto has launched Solana (SOL) staking for its European customers. Robinhood announced this development in a press statement dated Wednesday, May 15.



Emphatically, European users of Robinhood Crypto can now stake their Solana holdings directly through the app starting today. This development marks Robinhood’s first foray into crypto-staking products exclusively available to its European customers.



The decision to select Solana for Robinhood’s inaugural staking product was influenced by the token’s popularity among its EU customer base. Besides, Johann Kerbrat, the general manager of Robinhood Crypto, highlighted the simplicity of staking on the Solana network compared to Ethereum. 



Kerbrat cited Solana’s shorter bonding period of approximately two days, unlike Ethereum’s variable period, which can extend from several days to weeks.



Meanwhile, Kerbrat noted the new feature will offer an approximate annual percentage yield (APY) of 5% at launch. While the initial APY is subject to change based on the fluctuating nature of staking rewards, Robinhood’s offering is shy of Coinbase’s estimated 5.42% reward for Solana stakers. 









Notably, Robinhood Crypto debuted in the European Union in December as a dedicated crypto trading application. Registered and regulated in Lithuania, the app has seen significant downloads, particularly in Poland, Italy, and Lithuania. 



The EU version of the app lists 33 tokens, surpassing the 15 crypto assets available on Robinhood’s U.S. trading platform. Notably, SOL and Solana-based memecoins like BONK and Dogwifhat (WIF) are accessible in the EU but not in the U.S.



Robinhood’s expansion of crypto services in Europe comes as its U.S. counterpart faces regulatory scrutiny. Recently, Robinhood received a Wells Notice from the SEC concerning its crypto listings. 



Kerbrat emphasized that Robinhood and its EU crypto branch operate as separate business entities. As such, the European operations remain unaffected by the ongoing developments in the US.

Interactive Brokers Rolls Out Bitcoin, Ethereum and Other Crypto Trading Services in UK | Coinspeaker



Interactive Brokers, one of the leading global electronic brokers based in the United States, is expanding its presence in the crypto industry with the rollout of digital asset trading services to British customers through its UK unit.

In an official press release on Wednesday, May 15, the company announced that it has added support for buying and selling various cryptocurrencies to expand its business offerings. Investors in the region can now trade Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (Ether), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) along with other traditional investment products offered by the firm.
Interactive Brokers Extends Crypto Trading to UK Customers
The move comes five months after the company teamed up with OSL Digital Securities (OSL) to introduce crypto trading services to retail customers in Hong Kong in November last year.




The company started its crypto journey in July 2021 with a focus on retail investors. However, a few months after the initial launch, Interactive Brokers opened trading for institutional customers in the country.
Now, the company is extending its crypto services to UK customers, allowing them to participate in the emerging economy. The new service is available to both retail and institutional customers of Interactive Brokers (U.K.) Limited (IBUK).
“Introducing cryptocurrency trading gives UK clients enhanced flexibility to invest across markets and asset classes while also adding exposure to digital assets,” said Gerald Perez, CEO of Interactive Brokers.
The company said that eligible customers of IBUK can seamlessly manage both their traditional securities and digital assets accounts opened at Paxos Trust Company through a single “unified platform”.
This means that users can access their crypto holdings together with other traditional assets such as stocks, derivatives, commodities, and foreign exchange products in one account through the unified platform.
The platform is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of users’ accounts, including their holdings and transaction history, without having to open numerous accounts on various platforms.
Low Commission Rates for British Customers
The company stated that British customers, including financial advisors, will enjoy low commission rates for digital asset trading on the unified platform.
The fee ranges from 0.12% to 0.18% of the trade value, with a minimum fee of USD 1.75 per order with no added spreads, markups, or custody fees.
The move aims to provide transparent and cost-effective trading options for users in the region.
On the Interactive Brokers platform, cryptocurrencies are priced in USD. This means that during trading, users will have to convert their GBP or other currencies to USD with tight spreads, ensuring efficient currency exchange.
However, when trading products denominated in a different currency than the one in the user’s account, users can incur potential conversion fees.
Meanwhile, Interactive Brokers Limited is regulated in the UK by the country’s market watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
The company registered with the agency as a crypto assets firm in compliance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds Acts of 2017.

UK cannabis millionaire’s legal ‘deals on wheels’ via crypto


            
Financial failure does not phase medical marijuana millionaire and entrepreneur Maximillian White. 



Europe’s wealthiest legal cannabis tycoon has seen misfortune quite a bit, twice in his own career and once in his father’s. However, his personal reaction when his business lost $29 million in the Cypriot banking collapse in 2012 was a little unusual.



Instead of eking out his remaining money, he blew it on buying a Rolls Royce that he drove about in public.



“I’m a proud man. I didn’t want people to think I was lost,” he says. “I may also be a poser.” In reality, he is a hard worker who isn’t afraid of failing.



Like many of his generation, White is now embracing blockchain — with a unique use case for NFTs — as part of his business.He says the whole is better than the sum of the parts, like a cocktail.




“For example, a Manhattan cocktail is a blended mix of whiskey, sweet vermouth and bitters. It’s the combination that makes it great. For me, it’s the combination of cannabis, blockchain and crypto – you can’t go wrong.”




Who is Maximillian White? 



White’s first career was in music production, including working on a track with Drake that resulted in the hit “One Dance.” He also built and sold a music streaming service called Beatport, which made him millions.



Maxmillian White (Jordan Bareham)



His love affair with Portugal saw him create a beach club called Blanco Beach, which was frequented by Rio Ferdinand and featured top performances from Tyga, Tory Lanez, Roger Sanchez, Rick Ross and French Montana. It has since closed.White also has ADHD, which he reckons allows him to have an eclectic taste in music, from classical to U.K. funk and hip hop.



He says he knew he was going to be a business builder while still in primary school. When asked to dress up as the man he was going to be, he did not arrive at his classroom as a fireman or a policeman. Instead, he opted to dress up like an entrepreneur, wearing a sheepskin jacket and carrying a classic cloth swag bag.



He attributes his work ethic to his early life, singing as a chorister in Durham Cathedral and never having a day off, including singing on Christmas Day. 



He made most of his fortune selling medicinal marijuana to wholesalers around the world and setting up Europe’s largest plantation in Portugal, a massive 40-hectare farm. He somehow managed to secure multiple government partnerships in territories previously untapped.



He expanded into property in Dubai, Majorca and Eastern Europe and says his interest was sparked by the loss of the family home as a child. His father lost everything, and they had to move to a council home. He has since experienced even greater personal tragedy in the full glare of the public eye when his brother died in a violent altercation at a Dubai nightclub in 2022.






Legal marijuana and crypto



Many people who grew up with restrictive marijuana laws may be uncomfortable with legalized weed, but in recent years, the laws around the world have become increasingly liberal.

Medical marijuana is now legal in more than 50 countries, and nine countries have legalized recreational marijuana use, including Canada, Germany, South Africa and Thailand. Ironically, despite the Netherlands’ reputation, weed is not strictly legal there, though it is tolerated.



Back in 2021, White told Ladbible about plans to develop a cannabis industry cryptocurrency called MEDI. That token never launched — he got caught up building his medical marijuana business instead — but three years on, he’s revised and revamped the plans into something new.



LadBible’s report on his previous crypto project. (Ladbible)



Aided by digital marketeer Ricardo Capone, an old friend now serving as his chief technology officer, White has teamed his cannabis product with NFTs to provide a traceability engine on the blockchain for his plants.



White says that when he first came across NFTs, he didn’t see them as valuable art pieces. Even though Beeple’s $69 million NFT sale dominated the news, White was not excited about artist sales or royalties.




“However, I instantly got smart contracts, that’s what excited me. I could see the future business use which would decrease the need for lawyers. People could buy cars or property using smart contracts, or you could sell a business with full transparency. Smart contracts made me delve further into the space.”




NFTs representing a business



However, White is not so sure about whether the term has a good reputation any more. Given he’s already selling recreational cannabis, he is slightly wary about doubling down by pairing it with the term “NFTs”.



Dr Green NFTs represent a share of a business (Dr Green)



“People lost a lot of money investing in NFTs, typically digital art, but the technology is what excites me. So, I think the onus is on us to educate people about this real-world asset, or digital asset, and what it can do. It’s not just about flipping art. 



“Again, I bring it back for business use,” he says, explaining how NFTs — which are unique tokens — can represent a fractional share of a real-world property. “For example, maybe people purchase properties today, using NFTs as a means of showing ownership. If you can’t afford the entire house, maybe you could buy a portion, and in the future, you could even sell that NFT, earn profit and put it into your next house.”



His latest crypto-related project is called Dr Green, with NFTs being used as part of the distribution business or what he calls “unique business passes for people.” A total of 5,145 unique NFTs provide holders with access to the Dr Green DApp so they can build a community to sell cannabis. There are also plans to release Platinum NFTs linked to cannabis-loving celebs who’ll create their own strains.



The DApp requires KYCing customers to ensure the product is only sold in regions where this is legal. Payments are taken in fiat or crypto, with the sellers’ markup paid out in Ethereum.DrGreen then ships the products out.



Maxmillian White and Ricardo Capone, the chief technology officer of Dr Green (Jordan Bareham)



Supply chain tracking of weed on blockchain



White says the blockchain traceability proves the quality of the product and says he spent millions investing in the “cannabis farm, processing plant and R&D facility.” 




“We have put significant money into developing one of the most sophisticated medical cannabis businesses. By putting our recreational business on the blockchain, we are using technology to track everything, ensure we are compliant with all laws, and it also allows us to function as a hub for distributed entrepreneurs.”




In short, the NFTs are a bit like a license to operate a business hooked into his distribution network and can be traded on to others if necessary. The value of the NFT rises based on how many customers it represents. Some will see this as a savvy business move blending technology and entrepreneurship, while others will no doubt see it as morally bankrupt and corrupting our youth. But times are changing.






“Our NFTs are acting like a digital key or real-world asset, where you can plug into the systems of a company that is already up and running.”



Interested, but still cautious about crypto



Despite his interest in blockchain, he is cautious about the hype around cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument and believes there is an inherent flaw in the way cryptocurrencies are valued against the dollar. 



“If the price of crypto is always going to be valued in real-world money, then how can it be decentralized? The dollar will never be decentralized, and I think that is a dangerous precedent.”

Solana Game 'Nyan Heroes' Reveals Token Launch Amid Play-to-Airdrop Push - Decrypt

Cat-themed shooter Nyan Heroes has confirmed that it will launch its NYAN token on the Solana blockchain next week.The Overwatch and Titanfall inspired mech shooter has been in pre-alpha since March, reportedly breaking into the top 30 titles on the Epic Games Store with over 200,000 downloads.On Tuesday, May 21, the official Nyan Heroes token NYAN will be launched on the centralized exchange Bybit. In addition to this launch, the announcement hints that details regarding the long-awaited NYAN airdrop are coming soon.NYAN tokens will be airdropped to players who participated in the game’s play-to-airdrop campaigns. Players are able to earn MEOW and CATNIP points by playing the game or engaging on social media, and these points will earn players an allocation of NYAN once the token has launched. It appears with the announcement that NYAN is coming next week, details on how to claim this airdrop are also just around the corner.Developed by Singapore-based game studio 9 Lives Interactive, the game received $3 million in funding to support the launch of the game. This led to a successful pre-alpha launch on the Epic Games Store, bringing in over 100,000 players in its first week and a half.Currently the game has no NFT integration as the developers are focusing on gameplay first. For this reason, the game can be played entirely without touching crypto or even having a wallet. Even with the token launch, this is going to stay the same.9 Lives Interactive Creative Director and CEO Max Fu told Decrypt that there will be an in-game premium currency for purchasing “Web2” items. There will also be special items marked as “awakened” that are tokenized and can be traded, but engaging with the crypto side of the game is completely optional.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari Makes Critical Bitcoin (BTC) and Economic Statements - Bitcoin Sistemi


Minneapolis FED President Neel Kashkari shared his views on various aspects of the US economy in a recent statement. Kashkari said the FED is focusing on underlying demand in the economy to control inflation.
Kashkari expressed surprise at the resistance of American consumers and said, “Americans are spending more than I expected.” Kashkari also noted the robustness of the housing market, which exceeded his expectations.


The FED's current policy stance has also been a matter of debate. “The biggest question mark right now is how restrictive the policy is now,” Kashkari asked, suggesting that it may be necessary to maintain the current stance for a while to determine the future direction of inflation.

Kashkari also touched on the issue of US government debt. With rising debt, higher borrowing costs may be needed in the near term to meet the 2% inflation target, he said.





Regarding cryptocurrencies, Kashkari reiterated his skepticism about Bitcoin. “Bitcoin has very few practical uses, it is not an investment instrument or currency,” he said. He also reiterated his doubts about the value of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).

Sam Altman's Worldcoin project is taking a tumble.
                        Worldcoin ($WLD), the blockchain project helmed by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, has fallen nearly 20% in the last two weeks and 6.4% overnight despite other leading cryptocurrencies posting green candles.The WLD token currently trades for $4.83.That’s 59% short of its all-time high (ATH) of $11.74, posted on March 10 this year just as the entire market was rallying in line with Bitcoin, which posted its own ATH of $73,737.94 four days later.Since then, fortune hasn’t favored Worldcoin. The token tumbled down to lows of $4, where it has found consistent support but it has faced strong resistance on the way to the $7 mark.WLD’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 37 which indicates some recent selling has contributed to the downturn.In the short-term, there is still some space for further losses, but the bulk of the downward price pressure should be relieved by tomorrow.OpenAI’s Worldcoin: Will $WLD Bank The Unbanked?
Worldcoin was a controversial launch last year due to its premise: anyone wanting some $WLD has to visit a biometric eyeball scanner called the ”Orb” and submit a snapshot of their eyeballs.They’re found in Berlin, Dubai, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, San Francisco, Seoul, and Tokyo.This data is then used alongside verification of government-issued ID to confirm a user’s personhood before distributing coins to them.OpenAI says Worldcoin is building blockchain infrastructure to bank the world’s unbanked, enabling everyone “to broadly share the coming technological prosperity ” according to its website. “Privacy first. Owned by everyone.” reads the slogan.But many are skeptical, including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin who wrote a blog post listing his concerns of the protocol’s privacy, accessibility, centralization and security and said it could take years for it to work.Lawmakers around the world are also monitoring the protocol, with press reports suggesting authorities in Mexico, Malaysia and Argentina have all aired similar concerns recently.This year the project hit a new high back in January when it welcomed 16,000 Orb signups in a single day after surpassing the 5 million mark the preceding month.From Eyeballs to Wieners, New AI Meme Coin WienerAI Raises $1.9 Million in ICO.
The recent volatility of Worldcoin’s $WLD reflects a token that consumers are still unsure about. Sure, Worldcoin has an intriguing premise, but in a world of constant data breaches, biometric information can seem like to0 high a price to pay to get crypto.Thankfully, a new generation of meme coins is cropping up which brings bundles of non-invasive utility along with some laughs to boot.Leading this new generation of coins are projects like the blockchain security guard dog Scotty the AI, which raised $10 million at presale, and crypto’s trading companion WienerAI, an enticing new presale that has already lapped up $2 million in a month.$WAI is a brand new meme token and AI companion that may yield potentially eye-watering rallies once word gets out about its core offering.Touted as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner”, WienerAI ($WAI) is a digital companion that gives its owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees.Around 20% of $WAI’s supply is for staking.WienerAI’s website offers buyers the ability to stake during the presale, in order to take advantage of the lucrative yield, which is currently 525% APY.Furthermore, WienerAI is transparent.

                        Chinese police in Sichuan province apprehended some suspects of an underground banking scheme on May 15 for allegedly facilitating illicit foreign exchange transactions involving about $2 billion worth of Tether’s USDT.According to a report from Baijiahao.baidu, the Sichuan police arrested the suspects for allegedly using USDT to evade national foreign exchange supervision while providing illegal settlement channels.Tether’s USDT Used to Evade National Foreign Exchange Supervision
The operation resulted in the shutdown of a major underground banking scheme involved in smuggling operations worth 13.8 billion Chinese yuan, equivalent to about $1.9 billion. USDT was revealed to have been the conduit for the illicit transactions.The scheme spanned 26 provinces across China, including municipalities and autonomous regions. The police arrested over 90 suspects associated with the scheme.Stablecoins like USDT are often exploited to bypass foreign exchange supervision due to their price stability and anonymity of cryptocurrency, making them suitable for storing and transferring funds without the risk of price fluctuations.This latest arrest of suspects using illicit foreign exchange transactions follows a similar event in the arrest of Cartier’s heir, Maximilien de Hoop Cartier, by the US Department of Justice (DoJ).The DoJ’s indictment revealed that Hoop Cartier allegedly collaborated with a Colombian drug cartel to import 100 kilos of cocaine and laundered hundreds of millions of dollars, primarily through over-the-counter (OTC) USDT stablecoin trades.Is The Regulation of Tether’s USDT Imminent?
This is not the first time malicious entities have been linked to using USDT to launder money.A United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report highlighted the USDT as a key tool used by money launderers and fraudsters.Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse further fueled speculation by suggesting that the US government is targeting Tether in an interview on the World Class podcast.VIDEOGarlinghouse admitted uncertainty about the company’s potential regulatory fallout, however, despite its big influence in the cryptocurrency market.These comments elicited a strong response from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, who fired back at Garlinghouse, labeling him an “uninformed CEO” and highlighting Tether’s proactive collaboration with global law enforcement agencies to combat illicit activities.Ardoino said that Tether has partnered with 24 agencies in over 40 countries, successfully blocking wallets in response to 198 requests in the last year and 339 requests in the last three years.Despite these developments, the US government’s anticipated regulatory scrutiny of Tether may be unfounded.Earlier this week, on May 14, Tether froze $5.2 million worth of USDT due to its association with phishing scams. Additionally, Tether has partnered with Chainalysis to develop monitoring and analysis tools to identify wallets associated with illicit or sanctioned addresses.

$1 Billion Bitcoin Leaves Coinbase: Who Is Buying?


								On-chain data shows the Coinbase exchange has just seen a massive Bitcoin outflow, a sign that some large-scale buying might be going on.
Over 16,000 BTC Left The Coinbase Platform In The Past Day
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, Coinbase has observed a huge outflow for the seventh time this year. The on-chain metric of interest here is the “exchange outflow,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin leaving the wallets attached to a centralized exchange.
When the value of this metric is high, it means that the investors are currently withdrawing large amounts from the platform in question. Generally, holders take their coins out of the custody of these central entities whenever they plan to hold onto them for extended periods.

Additionally, the trend can also be a sign that these coins coming out are fresh buys, so exchange outflows can have an overall bullish effect on the cryptocurrency’s price.
On the other hand, the indicator having a low value may imply that there isn’t much interest in buying the asset right now. Depending on the trend in the opposite metric, the exchange inflow, such a value may either be bearish or neutral for the coin.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange outflow specifically for the Coinbase Advanced platform:

As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange outflow for Coinbase has registered a huge spike in the past day. In total, 16,021 BTC, worth nearly a billion US dollars at the current exchange rate, has left the platform with this outflow. Given the massive scale, a large entity has to be involved here.
Coinbase, in particular, is known to be the preferred exchange for American institutional investors, so this accumulation may have come from one such trader. A more zoomed out view of the chart of the same indicator shows this certainly isn’t the first time such a withdrawal has occurred on the platform.

Looks like the metric has registered several spikes over the past few months | Source: CryptoQuant
As the quant has highlighted in the graph, Coinbase has seen Bitcoin outflows of similar scale seven times in the year 2024 so far. Some of these buys preceded surges in the price, so it’s possible they were at least partially the instigator for them.
However, the more recent spikes have failed to produce any bullish effects on the cryptocurrency, so it’s hard to say whether the latest outflow would lead to any rally at all.

“There is a high probability that this transaction is a institutional purchase,” the analyst notes. “But on the flip side, it could also be an internal transfer by Coinbase.”
Naturally, if the latter is the reason for this apparent outflow, then the transaction wouldn’t really be relevant for the market.
Bitcoin Price
Bitcoin has seen a small jump of 1% over the past 24 hours that has taken its price back to $62,400.

Ethereum Bull Flag Breakout: ATH On The Horizon As Major Metrics Turn Bullish


																Crypto analyst Javon Marks has highlighted several metrics that have turned bullish for Ethereum (ETH). The analyst noted that one of these metrics suggests an all-time high (ATH) for the second-largest crypto token. 
Bullish Metrics For Ethereum
Marks remarked in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the bull flag-like price structure has formed on the Ethereum chart. He added that higher lows are forming in Ethereum’s price action, which is also a bullish signal as it suggests a strong resistance to downward trends. Meanwhile, the analyst claims lower lows in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicate a hidden bullish divergence with Ethereum’s price.

Marks then raised the possibility of Ethereum hitting a new ATH, stating that the “bull flag breakout might lead into new all-time highs and be of major service in many Altcoin progressions.” Before then, he claimed that Ethereum could soon experience a larger price breakout, making the crypto token experience a 63% upside to $4,811.
Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe also recently suggested that Ethereum could make a major move soon enough and lead altcoins to make new highs. According to him, this will be triggered by the news surrounding the Ethereum ETF, as he expects that to be the “rotation for the Altcoins.”

However, Ethereum also risks experiencing a significant decline, considering reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might reject the Ethereum ETF applications. Crypto analyst James Van Straten stated that a rejection of the Spot ETF “sends the ETHBTC ratio lower 0.047 to 0.03 as a long-term projection.”
This was one of the reasons why the analyst stated that “Ethereum looks like it’s going to the grave.” He also alluded to the fact that ETH has become inflationary with the Decun upgrade reducing transaction fees, which has ultimately reduced ETH’s burn rate.

Things Aren’t Looking Good For ETH
Crypto analyst Derek recently mentioned that “Ethereum dominance and recent performance are heading toward their worst ever.” He noted that attention has turned to Bitcoin due to the reports about a potential rejection of the Ethereum ETF and securities status, which has put pressure on investment sentiment. According to him, this has caused the “imbalance in dominance” to reach its worst point.

Derek further noted that Ethereum’s unimpressive price action is affecting other altcoins, as their prices are “depressed.” He also claimed that the prices of layer two coins “continued to be under pressure.” The analyst suggested that things could get worse, as the ETH/BTC chart shows a downward wedge pattern in progress. He claims that altcoins can only “breathe” if Ethereum can escape this pattern quickly.
At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2906, down in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Robinhood rolls out SOL staking to European markets

Trading platform Robinhood is targeting European users to expand its crypto services as legal challenges loom in the United States. On May 15, the company announced its first crypto-staking product, exclusively for European customers.According to an announcement, Robinhood customers can now stake Solana (SOL) and receive a 5% yield through the app. Competitors offering SOL staking, including Kraken and Binance, advertise yields of up to 5% and 8%, respectively.Stakers receive passive rewards from their holdings in exchange for supporting the network. When staking, users lock up their tokens to validate transactions and secure the network operations. Rewards from staking can change over time due to several factors, such as network inflation, the amount of SOL staked, validators’ commission rates, and market conditions. Along with SOL staking, the company introduced local-language versions of its crypto services for users in Italy, Poland and Lithuania, along with educational content focusing on Bitcoin (BTC), USD Coin (USDC), and Avalanche (AVAX). “Our customers in Europe have told us loud and clear that they want an app that provides local language support and products that help them earn additional passive income,” said Johann Kerbrat, general manager of Robinhood Crypto.Source: SolanaRobinhood has seen a surge in crypto trading activity in the first quarter of 2024. The firm posted a 224% increase in crypto trading volumes to $36 billion. Approximately 40% of its transaction-based revenue was generated by crypto-related services, resulting in the firm’s second straight profitable quarter with a $157 million net income.Despite the growing market demand, Robinhood’s crypto business still faces many challenges. On May 6, the company received a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), indicating an incoming enforcement action against its crypto arm. According to the filing, the SEC investigated Robinhood’s cryptocurrency listings and crypto custodian operations for alleged securities violations. As a precaution against possible securities violations, the company does not offer stake services in the United States, nor does it list some crypto tokens or provide lending services.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

CFTC Warns Public of ‘Money Mule’ Scams Involving Crypto Disguised As Work-From-Home Opportunities - The Daily Hodl


								Students and job seekers should be wary of a specific type of crypto scam falsely promising work-from-home opportunities, warns the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
“Money mule” scams involve criminals tricking people into sending and receiving money into their bank accounts, digital wallets, or spot-market crypto trading accounts as part of their supposed job responsibilities.










Melanie Devoe, director of the CFTC’s Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO), warns that even unwitting participants in money laundering can be charged criminally.
“Young people looking for summer jobs may be just looking for part-time income and could be attracted to offers that require being online a few hours a day. Unfortunately, they could become unwitting accomplices to money laundering or what the criminals call ‘money mules,’ and that association could land them in jail.”
The CFTC notes that victims might be directed to use Bitcoin (BTC) kiosks or other on-ramps to move cash into digital assets on a blockchain. They might also receive a large payment to a single crypto wallet and then be directed to split that payment and send it in smaller portions to a list of other addresses.
The regulator also warns the public to look out for “pig butchering” romance scams.
In a pig butchering scam, bad actors form a relationship with a victim online to gain their trust and convince the victim to invest in cryptocurrency platforms that the scammers control. Once the victim has invested a significant amount of money, the con artist disappears with the funds.
The fraudsters refer to their victims as “pigs” because they use elaborate storylines to “fatten up” the victim into believing they are in a close relationship.

Bitcoin Price Pumps 5% to $65K As CPI Data – Can BTC Break Out of Its Current Range? / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Bitcoin (BTC) price surged more than 5% back to the $65,000 level on Wednesday in wake of US CPI inflation data that showed moderating price pressures in April, supporting bets that the Fed will be able to ease interest rates a few times before the end of 2024.The rise in the Bitcoin price came alongside a 0.9% jump to new all-time highs for the S&P 500.Meanwhile, US bond yields and the US Dollar Index slumped to one-month lows.Traders are currently the most confident that there will be at least one cut by September in around one month.That’s according to CME data, which shows a 71% money market implied probability of at least one cut by September.One day ago, the money market implied probability of at least one cut by September was around 65%.Bitcoin now faces a crucial technical barrier in the form of its 50DMA at $65,166.If the Bitcoin price can break above here and its May highs around $65,500, further short-term upside could follow.The next level to watch would be the late-April highs around $67,000.Beyond that, a retest of yearly highs in the $73,000 area would be the next target.The Bitcoin price could soon surge back to yearly highs if it can break above these key levels. Source: TradingViewCan the Bitcoin Price Break Out of Its Multi-Month Range?
Fears about a gradual rise in inflation in Q1 2024 has been a major headwind to Bitcoin in recent months.Sticky inflation at the start of 2024 forced markets to price out aggressive Fed rate cuts.That’s probably the single biggest reason why Bitcoin stalled after hitting new record highs near $74,000 ahead of the halving.It has since been locked within a consolidation range, trading mostly between $60,000 and $70,000.But the latest inflation report, while not a game-changer itself, shows signs the Q1 inflation bump won’t last.If concerns about inflation are set to ease from here on out, macro could be about to flip to a medium-term tailwind for Bitcoin, rather than being a headwind.So can the Bitcoin price break out of its multi-month range?Well, in recent years, May hasn’t been a good month for Bitcoin.As per bitcoinmonthlyreturn.com, Bitcoin fell 35% in 2021, 15.5% in 2022 and 7% in 2023.As per Steno Research, over the past 5 years, Bitcoin hasn’t performed well during the middle months of the year.And post-halving rallies don’t typically get going until 4-6 months after the halving. That would suggest no major push higher until after August.But 2024 could be different as it’s an election year.Markets tend to rally into elections, breaking them out of their normal bearish summer conditions.Long-term Bitcoin price risks remain strongly tilted to the upside.Rate cuts, the halving, continued government spending and demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs could vault BTC above $100,000 in 2024 or 2025.

Two brothers manipulated Ethereum protocols to steal $25M - Justice Dept

Authorities with the United States Department of Justice have unsealed an indictment alleging that two individuals stole $25 million in cryptocurrency in a scheme that “exploit[ed] the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain.”In a May 15 notice, the Justice Department charged brothers Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. According to U.S. officials, the brothers fraudulently obtained $25 million worth of crypto “within approximately 12 seconds” using a scheme that “calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question.”“These brothers allegedly committed a first-of-its-kind manipulation of the Ethereum blockchain by fraudulently gaining access to pending transactions, altering the movement of the electronic currency, and ultimately stealing $25 million in cryptocurrency from their victims,” said Thomas Fattorusso, a special agent with the IRS Criminal Investigation’s New York Field Office.U.S. authorities said the brothers rejected requests to return the stolen funds and hid the assets using shell companies and foreign crypto exchanges, transferring them to several wallets. They could face up to 20 years in prison for each count if convicted.This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

Circle to move legal headquarters to U.S. ahead of IPO | Cryptopolitan

Circle, a key player in the stablecoin market, is packing up its legal base in Ireland and heading to the United States, eyeing a major step forward with its upcoming IPO.The decision, officially lodged in court documents, aims to plant Circle’s corporate roots deeper into U.S. soil, getting ready for a public offering that could shake up the crypto and traditional finance industry alike.Circle’s transition is targeted at U.S. investorsReports confirmed that Circle indeed has intentions to make the U.S. its new legal domicile, a change brought on as the company prepares to list its shares publicly.This transition isn’t just about geography, though. It is a strategic alignment to leverage the strong U.S. market framework and Wall Street as it steps into the IPO spotlight.Despite the excitement, a spokesperson kept the cards close to the chest, offering no specific reasons for this strategic decision.January was when Circle had its formal engagement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that revealed its serious IPO intentions.Circle has been recovering and expandingThe crypto market has been relatively favorable lately, with $USDC, Circle’s flagship $33 billion stablecoin, regaining its stride.From a dip to $24 billion market cap earlier in the year, $USDC has seen a notable market recovery, thanks in part to the general crypto market’s rally and high expectations of a bull run.This rebound is particularly impressive considering last year’s crises, which saw $USDC’s reserves hit hard by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.But Circle isn’t in this alone. Heavy hitters like Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and Fidelity back it, not to mention crypto-centric giants like Coinbase.Speaking of Coinbase, Anthony Bassili, head of tokenization there, recently highlighted their deep involvement with over $28 billion of assets in Circle, emphasizing their capability to also mint $USDC.Coinbase is betting big on expanding $USDC’s utility across its Base platform, aiming to set a precedent for others in the industry.The platform’s infrastructure, including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and integration of $USDC, promises enhanced security and broader adoption.Giving users the opportunity to trade diverse assets directly, without converting them to dollars, is one of their missions, according to Bassili.However, he notes that big developments in regulatory frameworks and product design are necessary to realize these goals.Since its launch, Coinbase’s Base, an Ethereum layer-2 chain, has not only doubled Ethereum’s transaction volume but also attracted an explosion in developer interest, boasting an 800% increase in activity.This surge has contributed massively to Circle’s 30% market capitalization boost in the first quarter of 2024 alone, paralleling a 15% rise in stablecoin revenue as part of Coinbase’s overall revenue increase by a third.

DOJ charges 2 brothers tied to $25M attack on MEV bots last year - Blockworks


Two brothers accused of orchestrating an attack last year on Ethereum trading bots have been indicted by the US government. 
The Department of Justice unsealed charges against Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno on Wednesday.
The pair are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering after the brothers allegedly tried to “exploit the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain to fraudulently obtain approximately $25 million worth of cryptocurrency within approximately 12 seconds.”
Both were arrested on Tuesday and will face judges in Massachusetts and New York. 
The April 2023 exploit targeted bots that seek profit by essentially trying to front-run transactions on the network. Maximum extractable value, or MEV, referring to the maximum value that can be obtained during transaction block production beyond rewards and fees.

The Peraire-Bueno brothers sought to “lure” MEV bots from the traders they allegedly targeted by “proposing at least eight specific transactions that…the defendants knew would cause the” targeted bots to include the lure transactions in the bundles, the indictment said. The exploit took advantage of a since-patched code vulnerability in the MEV-Boost software. 
“In each of these eight bundles, the victim traders effectively bought substantial amounts of particularly illiquid cryptocurrencies…for approximately $25 million of various stablecoins.” 
“Through the Exploit, which is believed to be the very first of its kind, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno manipulated and tampered with the process and protocols by which transactions are validated and added to the Ethereum blockchain. In doing so, they fraudulently gained access to pending private transactions and used that access to alter certain transactions and obtain their victims’ cryptocurrency,” a DOJ press release said. 
To avoid detection, the two tried to conceal their identities through shell companies and private crypto addresses. 
Following the attack, the brothers even “transferred the stolen cryptocurrency through a series of transactions designed to conceal the source and ownership of the stolen funds.”
They researched know-your-customer (KYC) procedures online, per the indictment, to learn the KYC standards and extradition procedures. They allegedly also researched the crimes they’d end up being charged with.
“As alleged in today’s indictment, the Peraire-Bueno brothers stole $25 million in Ethereum cryptocurrency through a technologically sophisticated, cutting-edge scheme they plotted for months and executed in seconds,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.

Why ‘multimodal' AI is taking over tech products

OpenAI and Google showcased their latest and greatest AI technology this week. For the last two years, tech companies have raced to make AI models smarter, but now a new focus has emerged: make them multimodal. OpenAI and Google are zeroing in on AI that can seamlessly switch between its robotic mouth, eyes, and ears.Why Nvidia needs to deliver on Q1 earnings“Multimodal” is the biggest buzzword as tech companies place bets on the most enticing form of their AI models in your everyday life. AI chatbots have lost their luster since ChatGPT’s launch in 2022. So companies are hoping that talking to and visually sharing things with an AI assistant feels more natural than typing. When you see multimodal AI done well, it feels like science fiction come to life.On Monday, OpenAI showed off GPT-4 Omni, which was oddly reminiscent of the dystopian movie about lost human connection Her. Omni stands for “omnichannel,” and OpenAI touted the model’s ability to process video alongside audio. The demo showed ChatGPT looking at a math problem through a phone camera, as an OpenAI staff member verbally asked the chatbot to walk them through it. OpenAI says it’s rolling out now to Premium users.The next day, Google unveiled Project Astra, which promised to do roughly the same thing. Gizmodo’s Florence Ion used multimodal AI to identify what faux flowers she was looking at, which it correctly identified as tulips. However, Project Astra seemed a little slower than GPT-4o, and the voice was far more robotic. More Siri than Her, but I’ll let you decide whether that’s a good thing. Google says this is in the early stages, however, and even notes some current challenges that OpenAI has overcome.“While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge,” said Google in a blog post.Now you might remember Google’s Gemini demo video from Dec. 2023 that turned out to be highly manipulated. Six months later, Google still isn’t ready to release what it showed in that video, but OpenAI is speeding ahead with GPT-4o. Multimodal AI represents the next big race in AI development, and OpenAI seems to be winning.A key difference maker for GPT-4o is that the single AI model can natively process audio, video, and text. Previously, OpenAI needed separate AI models to translate speech and video into text so that the underlying GPT-4, which is language-based, could understand these different mediums. It seems like Google may still be using multiple AI models to perform these tasks, given the slower response times.We’ve also seen a wider adoption of AI wearables as tech companies embrace multimodal AI. The Humane AI Pin, Rabbit R1, and Meta Ray-Bans are all examples of AI-enabled devices that utilize these various mediums. These devices promise to make us less dependent on smartphones, though it’s possible that Siri and Google Assistant will also be empowered with multimodal AI soon enough.Multimodal AI is likely something you’ll hear a lot more about in the months and years to come. Its development and integration into products could make AI significantly more useful. The technology ultimately takes the weight off of you to transcribe the world to an LLM and allows the AI to “see” and “hear” the world for itself.This story originally appeared on Gizmodo.

Black Donald Trump Rallies 600% Before Consolidating, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP), a Solana memecoin that was launched yesterday, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Black Donald Trump presents a similar opportunity.



BLATRUMP rallied over 600% in the first few hours after its launch, before consolidating as some early buyers cashed out their profits.



However, most investors are still holding their tokens, as they are waiting for BLATRUMP to be listed on ByBit later this week, as this listing will cause the coin’s price to skyrocket.




Its current price presents a great opportunity for new investors to buy the dip before the next rally. 



BLATRUMP has a market cap below $30,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of around $500,000-$1,000,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-3,000% in a matter of days or hours. 



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally another 12,000% in the coming two days, and Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, BLATRUMP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for BLATRUMP by entering its contract address – 29BiHVTBEo7RnbtwqwTmV3Hy6nDTadcCgopM6HUyjGRK –  in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BLATRUMP.

Binance Launches Arbitrage Bot and Expands Spot Copy Trading



On Wednesday, May 15, Binance introduced the Funding Rate Arbitrage Bot, an automated tool for spot and futures arbitrage strategies. This bot allows users to earn funding fees by automating the opening of a perpetual futures position and simultaneously hedging it with an opposite position in the spot market.




The hedging makes the strategy less risky than just investing in futures. While traders could execute this strategy manually, it requires significant work and expertise. The bot effectively cuts out that work, enabling regular traders to execute this strategy. 



According to Rohit Wad, Chief Technology Officer of Binance, the feature’s introduction was a result of user feedback. He highlighted the Spot Copy Trading feature’s positive reception, which has attracted over 700 Lead Traders since its initial launch.



Bots, Copy Trading Make Crypto More Accessible



The Funding Rate Arbitrage Bot is just one of many bots on the Binance bot marketplace. Currently, the company states that there are more than 120,000 strategies for automated trading for players to choose from. This aligns with a broader trend towards automated trading in crypto. 




Binance has also expanded its spot copy trading platform to fit this trend. Initially launched for select traders in late April 2024, the feature is now fully available to all eligible users as of Wednesday, May 15. 



Binance boasts that since its launch, over 70% of active Lead Traders on its copy trading have achieved positive P&L. This is even though the overall crypto market cap fell by 11% in April. With both bots and copy trading features, Binance aims to enable all traders to benefit from advanced trading strategies. 



On the Flipside




While automating trading strategies offers significant advantages, it is not without risks. To use these tools effectively, traders must understand their parameters and limitations.



Copying successful traders does not guarantee profits, as market conditions can change rapidly. At the same time, copy traders do not receive the same profits as traders they are copying.  




Why This Matters



The introduction of automated trading tools democratizes access to complex trading strategies. By simplifying trading, Binance enables a broader base to participate in the crypto market.

Is Starbucks (SBUX) a Buying Opportunity After Earnings or a Stock in Decline - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Since the start of the year, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has lost $23.2 billion in market value. The coffeehouse chain’s stock suffered a particularly steep drop on April 30th after the release of Q2 2024 earnings. 



This period contributed most to Starbucks’s value drain, accounting for a $14.3 billion reduction in market cap. With a year-to-date performance of negative 19%, would that make Starbucks stock an opportunity or a precursor to greater losses?



But before looking at the broader landscape in which Starbucks operates, what did the earnings report say?



Starbucks’ Downturn in Sales



Ending March 31st, 2024, Starbucks reported a 4% decline in global comparable store sales. Consolidated net revenue dropped to $8.6 billion, a 2% decrease from the year-ago quarter. Starbucks chief financial officer Rachel Ruggeri attributes this to a “complex and dynamic environment.”



In North America alone, operating income dropped 6% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, while overall net earnings decreased to $772.4 million from $908.3 million in Q2 2023. It also bears noting that Starbucks spent more than double on stock buybacks from that quarter, at $1.26 billion vs $479.3 million, respectively.



This figure aligns with the cash dividends paid of $1.29 billion. As we’ve seen with the recent record-breaking Apple example, once-controversial stock buybacks are a common tactic to retain investor confidence. 



When it comes to forecast expectations, Q2 was Starbucks’ second consecutive quarter, since beating estimates in Q3 ’23, to fail earnings per share consensus. And at a surprise of -13.92% ($0.68 reported vs $0.79 forecasted), it was a much greater failure than the one in Q4 ‘23 of -2.17%.





Are Starbucks Fundamentals Sound?



As a service provider, Starbucks is on the lower end of people’s priorities for needs. Considering this, the company relies on branding and in-store experience to leverage social capital, similar to Apple.



In other words, people who don’t care for Starbucks’ in-store experience would be much better off going to Costco with its frequent discounts to boot. This is why Costco (NASDAQ: COST) was recommended in January, with its stock price increasing from $657 to $787 per share since then.



During that same period, SBUX shares dropped from $93 to $75 per share. Inflation pressures have made people more mindful of their spending habits. The San Francisco Federal Reserve recently reported a complete depletion of cumulative pandemic-era excess savings.



At their peak in August 2021, they accounted for $2.1 trillion, having since drained to negative $72 billion by March 2024. Moreover, it is still unclear if the US hasn’t unofficially entered a recession. So far, updated mid-April, the Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI) is pointing toward a recovery.



While the growth is still negative year-over-year (YoY), it appears that recession has been avoided. Image credit: The Conference Board


However, coming into the election season, economic data should be taken with a grain of salt. After all, even the Fed Governor Christopher Waller complained that frequent economic data revisions make it difficult to deliver informed monetary policy decisions. 







What About Starbucks’ Flexibility?



Given the uncertainty of the “complex operating environment” mentioned in Starbucks’s earnings report, is it amenable to changing course?



Regarding pricing, it appears that it is off the coffee table. The company has been offloading inflation to its customers by increasing product prices, not lowering them. Moreover, Starbucks has to comply with mandatory minimum wage increases, which occasionally pop up across states.



This puts additional pressure on retailers to increase prices, which in turn increases customers’ pressure to ditch the brand. In contrast, utility companies that everyone needs can afford to tweak their pricing schemes accordingly. Investors should ask themselves if Starbucks has the capacity for that kind of flexibility.



To counter these pressures, Starbucks is focusing on boosting the attraction of Rewards memberships. In February, the company linked accounts with Bank of America for 2% cashback. However, even former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is warning that this may not be enough. 



In a LinkedIn post, he noted there are no quick fixes. In particular, “the stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience, through the eyes of a merchant. The answer does not lie in data, but in the stores.”



While the macro environment remains unpredictable, Starbucks forecasted to “return $20 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2025” via dividends and stock buybacks. At the same time, this trend has been heading against the ongoing unionization of the Starbucks workforce. That this represents a clear threat to the company’s bottom line was acknowledged in the November 2021 filing. 




“…labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs,”




While fast-food chains are steadily rolling out automated kiosks to cut costs, Starbucks has yet to shift in this direction, which would erode its very branding.




“…our labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other requirements and expectations that could increase our costs,”




Where Does Analyst Forecasting Stand on SBUX Stock?



At the present price level of $75.63, SBUX shares are very close to their 52-week low of $71.80 per share. For the last 52 weeks, the average SBUX price has been holding at $95. According to analyst forecasting pulled by Nasdaq, this is a buy-on weakness opportunity.



The lowest estimate is aligned with the present price at $75, while the average SBUX price target is $88.48 per share. WSJ’s estimate is even more optimistic, with a low target of $77, while the average target is $87.90 per share. 



It remains to be seen if Starbucks brand loyalty will materialize these targets, aided by further stock buybacks.

Buy signal? XRP whales stack $55 million in two weeks


XRP whales embraced the opportunity to accumulate more tokens as the cryptocurrency market experiences a mostly neutral sentiment. Traders wonder whether this is a buy signal for the token amid developments related to Ripple, XRP’s largest holder.
In particular, the well-known trader and on-chain analyst Ali Martinez posted Santiment‘s data on X on May 15. Martinez highlighted a notable accumulation from whale addresses with a balance between 1 million and 10 million in the past 15 days.
These XRP whales have increased their total stash by 110 million XRP, from 3.60 billion to 3.72 billion. Notably, this investor’s category has been accumulating more tokens in an uptrend since March, making higher lows and higher highs.


Moreover, today’s data shows a yearly high for the amount of XRP supply in the hands of ‘1M-10M’ whales. This also indicates a bullish divergence, considering the price has been dropping ever since—in the opposite direction.

XRP social volume as whales accumulate
Looking for further insights, Finbold retrieved data from Santiment’s data, crossing XRP’s social volume with whale accumulation.
Interestingly, social interest and mentions for the token have been falling since a peak in March. This is another indicator of a social divergence, where whales seem bullish while the crowd has lost interest.
Usually, this asymmetry indicates a future rise in prices and a buy signal for savvy traders and investors.

Ripple dumps 150 million as XRP whales accumulate 110 million
Conversely, Ripple started its monthly dumps in May by selling 150 million XRP at an approximate value of $75 million. The sell-off is part of the company’s revenue model, releasing locked tokens from the genesis block and making them circulate—essentially inflating XRP supply.
Ripple unlocks 1 billion XRP on the first day of every month and sends 200 million to its treasury reserves. This activity pressures the cryptocurrency price, considering that new XRP tokens are available for whales to purchase.
For example, the company’s recent supply increase overwhelmed the recent 110 million whale demand. Meanwhile, investors actively look for further developments in the market to understand when is the best time to make a purchase, or exit a position, according to the asset’s economic dynamics.

El Salvador: Bitcoin mining with geothermal volcanic energy

El Salvador has made global headlines for its innovative initiatives in the field of cryptocurrencies, particularly for the use of geothermal volcanic energy in Bitcoin mining. 
This small Central American nation has accumulated a total of 5,750 Bitcoin, worth 354 million dollars, over a period of three years. 
Among these, 474 Bitcoins, worth about 29 million dollars, have been mined using volcanic geothermal energy since 2021.

The context of Bitcoin mining in El Salvador
In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, alongside the US dollar. This historic step was part of a broader strategy to promote financial inclusion, attract foreign investments, and reduce remittance costs. However, the implementation of Bitcoin as legal tender has sparked numerous debates and controversies at both national and international levels.
El Salvador is located in an active volcanic region, which gives it a significant potential for geothermal energy production. The Tecapa volcano, in particular, has been used to power Bitcoin mining operations. 
The state power plant has produced 102 megawatts (MW) of energy, of which 1.5 MW were specifically allocated to cryptocurrency mining. This facility uses around 300 mining processors to extract Bitcoin, a process known for its high energy consumption.
Bitcoin mining is a process that involves solving complex mathematical problems to verify transactions on the Bitcoin network. This requires a large amount of computing power and, consequently, a significant amount of energy. 
By using geothermal energy, El Salvador has managed to make the mining process more sustainable and environmentally friendly, reducing dependence on non-renewable energy sources.
The use of geothermal energy for Bitcoin mining has several advantages. First of all, it reduces operating costs, as geothermal energy is generally less expensive than conventional energy sources. Furthermore, geothermal energy is a renewable and clean energy source, which helps to reduce the environmental impact associated with cryptocurrency mining.
Challenges and Controversies
In a global context where climate change is a growing concern, El Salvador’s approach represents a positive example of how emerging technologies can be integrated with sustainable solutions. This model could be replicated in other regions with similar geothermal resources, promoting a greener cryptocurrency mining industry.
Despite the benefits, El Salvador’s initiative is not without challenges. The adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender has been met with skepticism by international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has expressed concerns about economic stability and the risks associated with cryptocurrencies.
Furthermore, there have also been internal disorders, with a part of the population protesting against the adoption of Bitcoin, citing concerns about the volatility of the cryptocurrency and the lack of adequate infrastructure for its widespread use.
Despite the controversies, the Salvadoran government, led by President Nayib Bukele, remains firm in its commitment to Bitcoin. The extraction of 474 Bitcoin using volcanic energy is just an initial step in a broader strategy to leverage the country’s natural resources for economic growth and technological innovation.
The government is also exploring further uses of geothermal energy for other technological and industrial projects, aiming to transform El Salvador into a hub for innovation and technology in Latin America.
Conclusion
The initiative of El Salvador to use volcanic geothermal energy for Bitcoin mining represents a significant breakthrough in the global cryptocurrency landscape. Although not without challenges, this strategy demonstrates how natural resources and emerging technologies can be integrated to promote sustainable economic development.
With its pioneering approach, El Salvador is charting a new course that could be followed by other countries looking for innovative and sustainable solutions in the world of cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin Rises on CPI Inflation Data As Experts Predict Miners Send BTC Parabolic - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin (BTC) has printed a sudden 7% bounce following data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealing that inflation data cooled in April.
According to the BLS, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services, increased by 0.3%, slightly less than what was forecasted.










Both Bitcoin and stock markets responded well to the data, with the S&P500 reaching new all-time highs above the 5,300 level, and BTC rebounding to $65,152.
With Bitcoin’s halving now in the rearview, analysts are waiting to see how the BTC mining ecosystem will react to its rewards being cut in half, and the effect it could have on the leading crypto asset by market cap.
Quant analyst PlanB says that based on the historical correlation between miner revenue and price action, BTC should go “vertical” later in 2024 as the industry’s revenue recovers from the halving.
“Historically, bitcoin miner revenue recovers 2-5 months after a halving, and after that Bitcoin price goes vertical.”
Source: PlanB/X
On-chain analyst Willy Woo says that the mining industry could consolidate to fewer, stronger miners who are less likely to sell due to having larger margins and more efficient business models, thus easing sell pressure on Bitcoin.
“Thesis:
Inefficient miners get culled at the halving.
They dump their BTC before dying.
Only the strong ones survive.
They operate on fatter margins so don’t need to sell.
Miner sell pressure gone.
Takes 2-5 months for the new supply/demand to reflect in price.”
Fundstrat’s Tom Lee is also optimistic about Bitcoin miners, saying that miners have the “leverage” to pump the price of BTC further.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $64,980.

Ethereum ETFs in Doubt: BlackRock Filing Details SEC's Play - DailyCoin


        

The SEC has not yet decided on the first Ether ETF as an old filing has raised questions about Ether’s classification.



Analysts believe the SEC may reject applications due to how Ether will be categorized.



The fate of several other Ether ETF applications hinges on the SEC’s upcoming verdict.




The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to deliver a verdict on the first spot Ether ETF application by May 23, but a recent filing has cast doubt on the entire class of Ether ETFs. The filing, unearthed by legal experts, hints at the SEC potentially classifying Ether (ETH) as a security, a move that could significantly impact the cryptocurrency market.



SEC Roadblock for Spot Ether ETFs?



The unearthed details come from a March filing by BlackRock, which sought to list a spot Ether ETF on the Nasdaq. While the filing delayed the SEC’s decision on BlackRock’s ETF until June, it also raised a critical question: can Ether be classified as a commodity to qualify for a commodity-based ETF structure?




Analysts believe this could be a strategy by the SEC to reject spot Ether ETF applications. “The filing suggests they might deny these applications on the grounds that they’re improperly filed as commodity-based trusts holding a security,” explains Scott Johnsson, an Associate at Davis Polk and Wardwell.







This aligns with the current skepticism surrounding spot Ether ETF approvals. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes the SEC’s chances of approving these ETFs are “slim to none.”



Will SEC Approve VanEck’s Offering?



The fate of several spot Ether ETF applications hinges on the SEC’s decision on VanEck’s offering, which is the first in line. If rejected, ARK 21Shares, Hashdex, Invesco Galaxy, BlackRock, and Fidelity applications could all face similar denials. Notably, Grayscale also withdrew its spot Ether ETF application earlier in May, further adding to the uncertainty.



The core of the issue lies in how the SEC classifies Ether. While SEC Chair Gary Gensler previously stated Ether wasn’t a security, reports suggest an ongoing SEC investigation into the cryptocurrency. This investigation and the recent filing create confusion for the industry.




All eyes will be on the SEC as they decide on VanEck’s application on May 23. Additionally, Chair Gensler’s speech at the Investment Company Institute summit on the same day may shed light on the SEC’s stance towards Ether and spot Ether ETFs.



On the Flipside




The industry could challenge Ether’s security classification in court, delaying any final decision on spot Ether ETFs.



Grayscale withdrawing its application could indicate a shift in its strategy, not necessarily a reflection on the overall viability of spot Ether ETFs.



Even if the SEC rejects VanEck’s application, it doesn’t necessarily mean all future applications will be denied.




Why This Matters



The SEC’s decision on the first spot Ether ETF application could set a precedent for the entire class, potentially derailing efforts to bring these investment vehicles to market and impacting how investors access and trade Ether, a major cryptocurrency with significant influence on the broader market.

Shiba Inu Burn Rate Suffers Scathing 91.94% Crash, What’s Happening? | Bitcoinist.com


								As the bearish pressures of the crypto market catches up to Shiba Inu, it has begun to manifest in other metrics of the meme coin. The most prominent in recent times is the SHIB burn rate, which has taken a significant nosedive during this time.
Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes 91.94%
In a surprising turn of events, the Shiba Inu burn rate has seen a significant decline of 91.94%. This drop comes in the last 24 hours, underscoring the lack of attention to this metric, as well as the conservative stance that investors have taken during this time.

According to the Shiba Inu burn tracking website, Shibburn, there were only 2.367 million SHIB tokens burned in the last day. This is in stark contrast to the 29.5 million that were burned the prior day. Also, looking at the burn rates from this week, it shows that this lack of interest is very recent and may have to do with the Bitcoin price crashing below $62,000.
Source: Shibburn
For example, on May 13, Shibburn reported that over 20.2 million tokens were burned, which was a 94.7% increase at the time. What followed this was the 29.5 million that was recorded on May 14, and at the time, it was an over 110% increase in the burn rate.
The lack of interest is also reflected in the number of burn transactions recorded in the 24-hour period. So far, only four burn transactions have been recorded in the last day, with the largest transaction carrying around 1.5 million SHIB. Furthermore, the last burn transaction was recorded 16 hours ago, as at the time of writing.
This decline in the daily burn rate has also impacted the weekly burn rate. Shibburn’s report show a 143.35 million token burn rate in the last week, which is only a meager 3.59% increase from the figures recorded in the prior week.


SHIB Investors Are Still Holding
Usually, when Shiba Inu burn rate declines, it often points to investors choosing to hold on to their tokens, and this is often reflected in their selling rate. According to data from Santiment, this trend has held as SHIB investors have refrained from sending their tokens to exchanges, leading to a significant drop in active SHIB deposits.

Source: Glassnode
This is bullish for the meme coin because when investors choose to send their tokens to exchanges, it means that they are looking to sell. In the present case of Shiba Inu, investors are choosing to hold on to their tokens rather than send them to exchanges, which means that they are not willing to sell.
An unwillingness to sell will crash the selling pressure and once demand surpasses the supply, then prices will have to recover. If Shiba Inu investors continue this trend, and the crypto market recovers once more, then the meme coin may be poised to rally from here.

Bitcoin and Dogecoin didn't join the meme stock party. Here's why

This week, meme stocks came back into the limelight after Roaring Kitty, the investor behind the GameStop saga in 2021, made a comeback on social media and sparked a renewed frenzy, lifting other meme stocks. Why Nvidia needs to deliver on Q1 earningsHowever, the price of Bitcoin and memecoins, such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, did not rise significantly. On Wednesday afternoon, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu both were up 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively, while the top cryptocurrency Bitcoin was up over 5%.During GameStop’s hike on Monday, Doge and Shiba jumped nearly 6% and 5%, respectively, but this is not extraordinary given how memecoins have rallied in the past after the meteoric rise of meme stocks.  The GameStop saga contributed greatly to Doge’s success in 2021. Dogecoin caught the attention of investors who were looking for a cryptocurrency equivalent to meme stock GameStop. Just as GameStop reached its peak, Dogecoin started to gain traction, peaking in May 2021 at $0.74 per coin.But this time, nothing like that happened. When meme stocks returned to action earlier this week, memecoins like Floki and Popcat experienced double-digit gains, but they don’t have the same market share and popularity as Doge and Shiba. To everyone’s surprise, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remained unfazed by the meme stock craze as if they had no relationship to it.That’s because crypto has evolved and become more macro, said Pat Doyle, a blockchain researcher at Amberdata, in an email. The recent meme stock rally wasn’t expected to last long the way it did in 2021, as mentioned by some experts. Doyle echoed the same sentiment by saying that 2021 had many catalysts, including covid, remote work, online time being increased, and stimulus checks being issued, among others, and none of them are happening in 2024.However, this doesn’t mean that these trends don’t affect crypto at all, as different pockets of crypto will react differently to equity market movements, he clarified.“One memecoin called GME (no relation to the stock) saw insane returns after Roaring Kitty returned to Twitter. However, the rest of the crypto assets in DeFi segments remained stable,” he wrote.“While the crypto space has grown and seen more adoption and maturity, the cost of deploying a memecoin is relatively low, which is why we are seeing such growth in this segment.”Cryptocurrency has become more mainstream this year as the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed the spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. This resulted in financial giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity jumping into the blockchain and crypto world and sending crypto to new heights.

Bitcoin is up $3,000 as U.S. CPI data reveals slower inflation in April


Bitcoin’s (BTC) price surged by $3,000 following the latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for April, which indicated a slowdown in inflation, boosting investor sentiment towards risk assets.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a rise in consumer prices by 3.4% in April year-over-year, a decrease from March’s 3.7%. 
This slower inflation rate has influenced a positive shift in market dynamics, with major stock indices reaching new highs and cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), seeing significant upticks.


  U.S. CPI chart. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics
This data, provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, indicates a moderation in inflation, which is a positive signal for markets sensitive to interest rate changes. Month-on-month, the CPI rose by 0.3%, slightly below the expected 0.4%.
In this regard, data provided by capital market commentary platform The Kobeissi Letter, in an X post on May 15, pointed out that while the latest CPI data shows the first decline in inflation in three months, the PPI data reveals a third consecutive monthly increase.

Given these conflicting trends, the Federal Reserve is expected to adopt a “wait and see” approach regarding future monetary policy decisions.
U.S. CPI data and its Impact
Following the CPI release, major U.S. stock indices responded with significant gains. The S&P 500 rose by 0.48%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index (NASX) increased by 0.7%, both setting new records. 
The tech sector, in particular, showed robust performance with the NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index climbing by 0.72%. These gains reflect growing confidence among investors that the Federal Reserve may adopt a more accommodative monetary policy in the near future.
The bond market reacted to the CPI data with a decrease in yields for both 2-year and 10-year U.S. government bonds, with the 10-year Treasury yield sliding seven basis points to 4.37%. 
Additionally the U.S. dollar index (DXY) dropped 0.5%, and gold added 0.7%
BTC price analysis
BTC USD 1 day price chart. Source: TradingView
BTC is now trading at $64,884.00, with a 1-day rise of around 6%. Analysts note that Bitcoin now faces a crucial technical barrier in the form of its 50-day moving average (DMA) at $65,166. 
If Bitcoin’s price can break above this level and its May highs around $65,500, further short-term upside could follow. The next levels to watch would be the late-April highs around $67,000, with a retest of yearly highs in the $73,000 area as the subsequent target.
The latest U.S. CPI data has significantly impacted the market, with Bitcoin experiencing a notable price surge. Investors are optimistic about potential shifts in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, contributing to gains in both the stock and cryptocurrency markets.
As Bitcoin approaches critical technical levels, its performance in the coming days will be crucial for determining its short-term trajectory.

Crypto Traders As Socially Valuable As Escorts To Brits, Study Finds - Benzinga

A study by researchers Gemma Newlands and Christoph Lutz found that Brits perceive cryptocurrency traders to be about as socially valuable as escorts.What’s Next: The study, titled “Occupational Prestige and Occupational Social Value in the United Kingdom,” highlights the evolving nature of occupational prestige and social value, offering a comprehensive analysis of 576 occupations.One of the most striking findings of the study is the low social value assigned to digital economy occupations.Cryptocurrency traders, in particular, were ranked near escorts in terms of their perceived usefulness to society.The study’s findings are based on a survey of 2,429 respondents, who were asked to rate the prestige and social value of various occupations on a scale of 0 to 100. Healthcare occupations, such as cardiologists and ambulance paramedics, topped the rankings for both prestige and social value. Conversely, illicit and stigmatized occupations, including human traffickers and online scammers, were rated lowest in both categories.“This highlights a significant disconnect between the economic impact of these professions and public perception,” said Dr. Newlands. “Despite the growing influence of digital finance, many people still view these roles with skepticism.”Also Read: How You Can Make ‘Serious’ Money In Bitcoin This Year: 10x ResearchWhy It Matters: The study underscores the distinct evaluation axes of occupational prestige and occupational social value.While prestige often correlates with education and income, social value is linked to an occupation’s perceived contribution to societal well-being. Dr. Lutz elaborated, “Occupational prestige and social value, although correlated, are distinct constructs. Our findings show that many high-prestige occupations do not necessarily have high social value, and vice versa.”For instance, footballers and investment bankers, who enjoy high prestige, scored significantly lower in social value. On the other hand, roles such as street cleaners and refuse collectors, though low in prestige, were deemed highly valuable for their societal contributions. “This divergence points to the complex ways in which we evaluate work and its impact,” Dr. Lutz noted.The implications of these findings extend beyond academic interest, touching on broader societal issues. The study encourages policymakers and employers to consider how occupational roles are valued and to address the perceived deficits in social value, especially in emerging fields. “There is a need to bridge the gap between public perception and the actual contributions of digital economy professions,” suggested Dr. Newlands.What’s Next: Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 provides a timely opportunity to discuss these findings and explore ways to enhance the societal value of digital economy occupations.

Opinion: Roaring Kitty looks to have returned as a pump-and-dumper


There was something different about the way that Keith Gill (aka RoaringKitty on YouTube or DeepFuckingValue on Reddit) used to shill GameStop. He’d do in-depth, long, and extensive live streams and videos sharing his thesis, always instructed that people should reflect on their personal financial situation before buying or selling shares, and generally told followers to take profit when they wanted to.
Gill was also quite active on YouTube and Reddit, where he’d show his own portfolio so people knew whether or not he was adding to or subtracting from positions.
But since he’s returned from his social media hiatus, which started with a meme about AMC stock that well-known pump and dumper Zack Morris had used a few days before, the public has witnessed a huge departure from this approach.
This time, Roaring Kitty isn’t sharing his theses or his portfolio positions, nor is he explaining why he likes certain stocks or live streaming for five hours at a time. Instead, he’s shitposting memes, clearly advocating for GameStop as a great buy (despite his previous thesis failing miserably), and basically pumping a stock for no clear reason.
RoaringKitty is no longer a thesis-driven trader — he’s another average pump-and-dumper with a large audience.

Read more: Andrew Tate seems confused as he dumps bitcoin to buy GameStop
Disappointing Kitty
There are any number of reasons that Gill could give to justify his posting of dozens of vague memes posted from his X (formerly Twitter) account, now boasting over a million followers.
For instance, it’s fair to say that since 2021, when meme stocks first became a concept and Gabe Plotkin blew up his fund, Melvin Capital, very little has changed in the finance world — particularly in regard to the issues that caused RobinHood to shutter all buying of certain stocks and the complexities of capital requirements.
Unfortunately, there is no Gabe Plotkin, Steve Cohen, Vlad Tenev, or Ken Griffin to frame up as the stereotypical villain. No evil VCs or hedgies are openly discussing shorting GameStop, short interest is nowhere near levels seen in 2021, and GameStop is little more than a company walking the thin line between failing business and bankruptcy protection.
Revisiting old Gill live streams and videos, you can listen to his thesis: GameStop will be the Amazon of gaming, it’s apparently going to build a massive digital marketplace, NFTs will play an important role, and locations are important so gamers can trade in old games and buy physical copies.
Needless to say, none of these theories panned out. Indeed, GameStop has closed 200+ stores in three years, it’s not making money, and Cohen has been a terrible CEO.
A new beginning for Roaring Kitty
Am I surprised that Roaring Kitty’s valiant return is to shitpost and pump and dump? Of course not. I imagine that the desire to take the easy road is almost impossible to resist when you know that one single tweet can move a stock 50%+.
I’m not sure how many individuals could stop themselves from doing so, especially if a win was almost guaranteed. But it is disappointing to see someone who spent years proudly shilling his investment the right way to turn around and immediately give in to his every whim.
I don’t know what’s next for Keith Gill, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Gary Gensler ask him more questions and scour his tweets for any possible way in which he broke rules and regulations.
I’m not sure what happened to Gill but he’s certainly not the same. Not only that, the new version of him isn’t as interesting, doesn’t have nearly as much to say, and, let’s face it, is a shadow of the hopeful figure he once presented for retail traders.

Crypto trader turns $155,000 to $1.16 million in two days


A cryptocurrency trader has turned an initial investment of $155,000 into a $1.16 million portfolio in two days. The trades occurred on Solana (SOL), speculating on the meme coins AMC and GME amid Roaring Kitty’s return.
Lookonchain reported the anonymous trader’s nearly 650% gains in a post on X on May 15. The crypto trader allocated $61,000 to buy 27.58 million AMC and $94,000 for 30.78 million GME. Currently, their combined value is now $1.16 million.

These meme coins play off the popularity of AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) and GameStop (NYSE: GME) stocks, now back on speculators’ radar after their success during the 2021 GameStop short squeeze.


Roaring Kitty’s come-back
Meme coins have seen a resurgence in the cryptocurrency market after a period of low activity. This renewed interest emerged following the return of the famous meme trader Keith Gill on social platforms on May 13. Gill, known as Roaring Kitty, became known for inspiring the GME short squeeze in 2021.
Roaring Kitty has been actively posting videos on X, hinting at the next meme asset he intends to boost. This wave of activity has ignited interest among traders, prompting many to follow his speculative moves closely.

Crypto traders lost ‘tens of thousands of dollars’ trading GME
However, some traders experienced significant losses trading GME, despite the success of a few. Another Lookonchain post highlighted that not everyone profited from the meme coin. 
“These three guys lost tens of thousands of dollars by buying GME with FOMO and panic selling after the price dropped!” the post stated. Lookonchain emphasized the importance of not buying with fears of missing out (FOMO) when prices are soaring, nor panic selling when they decline.

Previously, Finbold reported the story of a meme coin trader on Solana who lost $37,000 in 17 minutes due to the same combination of FOMO and panic selling. An issue that is common in the meme coin crypto casino, mainly among beginners trying to make “easy money.”
These incidents underscore the volatility and high-risk nature of cryptocurrencies, especially with meme coins. It also highlights the impact of influential figures like Roaring Kitty on trading behaviors. With meme coins back in the spotlight, traders are both eager and cautious, wary of repeating past mistakes while hoping for substantial gains.

Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) to Explode 17,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 17,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




DIAPAWS will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Diamond Paws.



Currently, Diamond Paws can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DIAPAWS on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Diamond Paws by entering its contract address – HCEn3J1sKqMqPxrQDE33rGhJvyXh4r3YgyzD2wiAm3ga – in the receiving field.




DIAPAWS currently has a market cap of just under $16,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

SHIB Makes Use of Falling Wedge as Exchange Reserves Plummet - DailyCoin


        

Shiba Inu cryptocurrency exchange reserves dropped to early 2022 levels.



Falling wedge pattern on SHIB’s daily charts marks a likely inflection point.



Contrarily, one crypto brokerage firm pours 144B SHIB coins into Coinbase.




According to the latest on-chain data from CryptoQuant, the second largest meme coin asset, Shiba Inu (SHIB), is becoming scarce on cryptocurrency exchanges. SHIB reserves have plunged by a whopping 95 trillion since June 26, 2021, when they were at an all-time peak of 246 trillion tokens.



Are Slimming SHIB Exchange Reserves Bullish?



Moreover, Shiba Inu’s reserves have dramatically plunged this year, starting in late February 2024. The notable decrease can be ascribed to the rising demand for meme coins. March 2024 has gone down in crypto’s history books as the most successful month for meme coins, with the cycle peak topping $56 billion at one point.







Depicted in blue, the shrinking exchange reserves now consist of approximately 151T. Large holders moved another 5T SHIB off exchanges from March 31, confirming the large holder sentiment surrounding the canine token. Shiba Inu’s transfers to self-custodial wallets indicate SHIB as a long-term investment and means of storage.



Falling Wedge Pattern Hints at Another Leg?



Meanwhile, Shiba Inu’s price performance produced a falling wedge pattern on the 1-day technical charts. Dami Defi on X spotted this and forecasted a 50% run potential if SHIB broke out. The sloping-down pattern depicted below can signal a positive price trend switch.







Usually developed over several months, falling wedges in crypto culminate in a bullish breakout when the crypto price convincingly exceeds the upper resistance line, supported by a strong increase in trading volume. Shiba Inu is trying to put the falling wedge pattern in effect with a slight increase of 1.5% to trade at $0.00002398.



Zooming out of the daily charts, the #12 seated Shiba Inu embarked on a 14.7% run over the past two weeks, bringing a 169% yearly return. For the falling wedge pattern to inspire another leg, Shiba Inu’s daily close is above $0.000024, as this narrow resistance line with 10.15T SHIB in 27.5K addresses presents a favorable setup due to fewer traders liable to sell their SHIB tokens.



On the Flipside




While a tendency to withdraw SHIB from exchanges persists, some large holders are also doing the opposite.



For instance, on May 15, 2024, cryptocurrency brokerage firm Cumberland deposited 144 billion SHIB tokens worth $3.3 million.



Earlier, the crypto fund also deposited 50.36B SHIB coins into OKX, leaving just $45K worth of SHIB on balance.




Why This Matters



Besides estimating demand, exchange reserves can indicate whether holders of a cryptocurrency are seeking to trade the crypto or keep it as a long-term investment.

Crypto Markets Bounce Back as Core U.S Inflation Hits 3-Year Low - The Defiant

Bitcoin surged 6% to $65,000, with Ether and Solana rallying 3% and 7%, respectively. Crypto markets rallied on Wednesday morning after the latest U.S. inflation figures came in under economists’ expectations.The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in April, falling short of the Dow Jones estimate of 0.4%. On an annualized basis, the CPI increased by 3.4%, in line with expectations but down from 3.7% in March.The CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services. It impacts crypto markets by influencing investor sentiment and economic forecasts; lower-than-expected CPI can boost confidence in risk assets like cryptocurrencies, while higher CPI can trigger fears of inflation and potentially more restrictive policy measures from the Federal Reserve.Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $65,000, marking a 6% increase in the last 24 hours. Ether (ETH) ticked up by more than 3%, while Solana (SOL) soared by nearly 8%, according to CoinGecko data.BTC PriceAmong meme coins, FLOKI (FLOKI) tops the charts with a 13% gain. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) also posted increases of between 2% and 4%.Crypto analyst Justin Bennett said, “BTC is hanging by a thread. The $61k support area is holding, but the longer Bitcoin trades below $65k on the weekly and monthly time frames, the worse this looks.”Michael Van de Poppe, CEO of MN Trading, told The Defiant that Ethereum is in the final stages of its correction. “Around 10% more to decline before hitting a higher timeframe support level. The good times are just a few weeks away,” he said.Meanwhile, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board disclosed in a May 14 filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had purchased approximately $100 million worth of the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and $64 million in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).AMC and GameStop tankAMC Entertainment and GameStop shares dropped in early morning trading as the momentum from the meme stock craze — rekindled on Monday by the social media return of "Roaring Kitty" — started to wane. AMC fell by 30% on Wednesday morning, while GameStop shares plummeted by 35%.However, broader U.S. stock markets posted gains following the inflation report. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite hit all-time highs on Wednesday.The S&P 500 increased by 1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose by 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8%.

This Trader Sees A 'Barbell Portfolio Of BTC And Memes' As Most Profitable Trading Strategy - Benzinga

Crypto trader Cred sees the polarizing sentiment in the current market as a consequence of the disparities in opinions to unevenly distributed returns and the absence of traditional cycle indicators.What Happened: The trader took to his X account to point out that the usual “risk curve” strategy—from BTC to Ethereum ETH/USD, then to large caps, mid-caps, and finally meme coins—has proven unprofitable this cycle. Instead, a barbell portfolio of BTC and memes has outperformed other strategies.Cred notes that ETH/BTC has shown unusual weakness, whereas it typically thrives in a risk-on environment. This weakness extends to ETH Layer-1 (L1) and Layer-2 (L2) trades, with meme coins on Solana SOL/USD outperforming NFTs on Ethereum, marking a shift in the "crypto as a casino" thesis.Also Read: Why This Crypto Market Is ‘A Bear Trap’ And Which Coins This Trader Is BackingMeme Coins Surging: End Of Cycle?Cred points out that meme coins have consistently led the market. Unlike in previous cycles, rotating out of meme coins has been costly, challenging the common belief that a surge in meme coin prices signals the end of a cycle.Bitcoin has deviated from its traditional bull market behavior by not experiencing the standard 30-40% pullbacks. This anomaly has sidelined many traders and given rise to various theories, including shorter cycle and super cycle narratives.The proliferation of tokens, amplified by meme coins, means that the "crypto bull market" no longer implies that all listed assets will rise. Instead, there are distinct winners and losers, with clear leaders like Solana outperforming stagnant sectors like the ETH ecosystem.Diverse traders, Diverse strategiesCred acknowledges the resulting diverse experiences and perspectives among traders. "It's entirely plausible that you have Trader A who rode Bitcoin, Solana, and memes and feels like stuff is hot and needs to cool off, whereas Trader B has barely made any money and feels like stuff hasn't even picked up yet," he notes.He emphasizes that different portfolios, trading styles, time horizons, and risk appetites contribute to the varied outlooks. Despite the disparities, Cred encourages the crypto community to stay calm and kind, as most traders believe in the long-term upward trajectory of the market.In response to Cred’s thesis, macro trader Alex Krüger said that the super cycle implies there are no more 85% drawdowns, but recurrent 20%-40% corrections, with regular ETF inflows and bitcoin partially dragged up by equities. He agrees that there may be a “supercycle,” but only for Bitcoin and not for altcoins.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Bitcoin Boom Sparks Surge In Crypto Wallet Recovery Services: ‘It’s Just Pure Economics’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

                        Meme coin markets are in overdrive, and Floki Inu is on the climb, with FLOKI bulls now targeting a new all-time high after an aggressive upside move triggered by Revolut.It’s no secret that dog-coins are here to stay. In fact, the unique staying power of Dog-themed cryptocurrencies is deserving of a focused study by academics.As an icon in the meme coin market since 2021, Floki Inu is once again leading the charge.The latest upside move appears to have been fuelled by a bullish listing for Floki Inu on Revolut Business, enabling European commercial accounts to invest in the FLOKI asset.FLOKI Price Prediction: Floki Inu Climbs +10.8% Bringing Week-On-Week Gains to +28%
As price actions hold strong in bullish form, Floki Inu is currently trading at a market price of $0.00022 (Representing a 24-hour change of +17%).The upside move, which was fuelled by a positive fundamental shift in the winds from Revolut, provided FLOKI with the perfect bullish third bounce off lower trendline support earlier this week.With a triple re-test of support for the bullish trading channel, it seems probable that there is now sufficient confidence in FLOKI’s technical structure to mount a higher push.This is contingent on FLOKI smashing up through a local layer of upside resistance around $0.00025.However, if bulls can fuel a price move above these levels, then FLOKI is left targeting a move up that will see price action attempt a new all-time high (with $0.00035 forming a strategic goal).Meanwhile, the upside movement could demand a brief stop-off ahead of its next push as the RSI shifts to a moderate bearish divergence at 67.32, although with sufficient momentum, an upside move could extend the RSI’s bearish signals as high as 85.Overall, with impressive technical form stemming from FLOKI’s triple-tested lower trendline, strong fundamental news, and capacity remaining on the RSI, upside moves are likely in the week ahead.To the upside, FLOKI targets a break above the ATH to hit $0.00035 in May (a potential +57%).Meanwhile, the downside risk could be that FLOKI returns to lower support at $0.00015 (a possible -32%).This leaves the FLOKI price prediction suggesting a risk: reward of 1.79 in the weeks to come—a bullish entry with moderate gains to be secured.But for some investors, 0.5x returns aren’t the reason they got into crypto, and to those investors – look no further than the latest Dog Coin craze: Dogeverse – the 1st multichain DOGE.Discover DOGEVERSE as Presale Slams Impressive $15m Raised Ahead of Explosive Multi-chain Launch

How Many Bitcoins El Salvador Extracted With Volcano Energy, In Which It Invested Millions Of Dollars? - Bitcoin Sistemi


El Salvador, a small Central American country, continues to make a splash in the world of global finance. According to Reuters, the country has successfully mined approximately 474 Bitcoins since 2021, thanks to a unique geothermal power plant originating from a volcano. This initiative significantly increased the government's total BTC portfolio, which stands at a staggering $354 million at current prices.
The “Bitcoin Office”, an official government organization of the country, reported that there are currently 5,750 bitcoins in the state coffers. The newly added 473.5 bitcoins worth approximately $29 million have been mined since September 2021. These Bitcoins were produced using small amounts of geothermal energy from the country's majestic Tecapa volcano.



The administration of President Nayib Bukele, who was re-elected for a second term earlier this year and is known as a Bitcoin enthusiast, has installed 300 mining devices to “mine” bitcoin from the volcano. Of the 102 megawatts (MW) produced by the state-owned power plant, 1.5 MW was devoted to cryptocurrency mining.
Cryptocurrency miners around the world have come under increased scrutiny recently due to their electricity-consuming operations and the impact their activities have on power grids and carbon emissions. But El Salvador's geothermal-powered mining operation offers a more sustainable alternative.

Crypto Giant Offloads Shiba Inu Worth $4.5 Million


								Cumberland, an institutional digital asset trading firm, has transferred a substantial quantity of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens, valued at approximately $4.5 million, to various cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase and OKX. This move comes amidst a noticeable slowdown in the market for SHIB.
Cumberland Offloads Almost All Shiba Inu Tokens
Over the past 24 hours, Cumberland executed significant transfers involving more than 210 billion SHIB tokens, according to on-chain data provider The Data Nerd (@OnchainDataNerd). The major portion of these tokens, approximately 144 billion SHIB, valued at roughly $3.46 million, was moved to the US-based crypto exchange, Coinbase. This transaction occurred within the last 12 hours, aligning with SHIB’s market price of $0.000024.
An earlier transaction within the same 24-hour period involved Cumberland transferring 50.36 billion SHIB worth $1.17 million to OKX as well as another 1.69 billion SHIB ($45,000) to an unnamed destination. These transfers combined have reduced Cumberland’s holdings in SHIB to just about 2 billion SHIB tokens, which currently value around $48,642, according to Arkham Intelligence data.


These transactions appear to follow a recent pattern of behavior from Cumberland. The firm’s transaction history over the past several days reveals a trend of more withdrawals than deposits, particularly involving the SHIB token.

The timing of Cumberland’s transactions correlates with a period of stagnation in the broader SHIB market. After breaking out to the downside from a bull pennant pattern in mid-April, the price of SHIB has since entered a consolidation phase, oscillating within a narrow range. The daily chart indicates that SHIB is currently trading between $0.00002058 and $0.00002750, showing a sideways movement that suggests a period of indecision in the market.
Market analysts often view such significant transfers of “whales” to exchanges as a bearish signal, hinting at potential selling pressure. The motivations behind Cumberland’s current strategy are not publicly known, but the scale of these transactions and the choice of exchanges are critical for market observers.

The ongoing developments have prompted varied speculations about the future movements of SHIB’s price, especially considering the token’s recent lackluster performance in the crypto market.
Currently, the Shiba Inu price is positioned between two key moving averages: the 100-day EMA, currently at $0.00002211, and the 50-day EMA, at $0.00002408. A daily close above or below either of these averages is likely to dictate the short-term trajectory of SHIB’s price.
Should this occur, the focus will shift to the previously mentioned trading range, specifically its resistance at $0.00002750 and support at $0.00002058, as these levels are expected to play a crucial role in the next phase of SHIB’s market activity.
At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00002404.

Bitcoin: Will Prices Easily "Explode" Past $74,000 Or Dump Due To Miner Capitulation?


																Bitcoin prices have been trending lower in the past couple of weeks and generally remain within a bearish formation. Although momentum appears to be picking up, bulls are not out of the woods just yet. 
Analysts are not losing hope and remain overly upbeat, expecting a surge that would take the world’s most valuable coin to new levels.
Bitcoin Forms A “Cup And Handle” Formation In The Weekly Chart
In a post on X, one of them, MikybullCrypto, said Bitcoin has formed a “cup and handle” reversal pattern, suggesting an imminent surge towards new all-time highs. This formation is a glimmer of hope for optimistic traders, especially now that prices have been moving lower and sideways, erasing gains posted in March.
BTC forms a cup and handle pattern | Source: @MikybullCrypto via X
The “cup and handle” formation is a technical pattern chartists use to identify potential reversals and confirm trend continuations. In the current setup, as identified by the trader on the weekly chart, the “handle” was formed after the recent price drop from all-time highs. The “cup” follows the price decline in 2022 and the subsequent recovery in 2023.

	Related Reading



Historically, if there is a breakout above the handle and the rim of the cup, prices tend to rally to new levels. For this reason, the analyst says that if buyers press on from spot rates, the breakout above the current range and all-time highs of $73,800 will be “explosive.”

For now, prices remain in a descending channel with clear resistance levels marked out in the immediate term at around $66,000 and $72,000. A breakout, reading from the candlestick formation in the daily chart, above these liquidation levels could spark demand, lifting the coin to new levels. 
Will Miners Dump BTC And Force Prices Lower?
However, lurking beneath the optimistic outlook is a potential storm cloud: declining on-chain activity. After the brief spike in on-chain activity on Halving Day due to the launch of the Runes protocol, transaction fees have been declining. 

According to YCharts, it is currently at $3.206, down from over $128 on April 20. This contraction means miners are getting less revenue, heaping more pressure now that there is more pressure on margins post-Halving.

	Related Reading



Now that miners are feeling the pinch of slashed block rewards and declining transaction fees, it is likely that they might liquidate some of their BTC to stay afloat. Their participation, especially in the secondary market, would heap more pressure on BTC, forcing prices lower.

ShibaSwap 2.0 Goes Live On Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 Blockchain


																The Shiba Inu ecosystem is migrating its native decentralized exchange to Shibarium in the form of ShibaSwap 2.0.

The DEX will now be usable on both Ethereum and Shibarium – the layer 2 blockchain of the SHIB ecosystem focused on scalable, fast, and cheap transactions.
Per a press release shared with CryptoPotato, ShibaSwap 2.0 will include new features like improved user processes for adding and reducing liquidity, staking and trend analysis.
It will also feature discovery charts for new and trending tokens, and foster onboarding for new tokens into the ShibaSwap market.
Transaction fees will be partially paid out to liquidity providers, enhancing the value of their LP tokens used in swap transactions.

“[ShibaSwap 2.0] “is the redesigned beating heart of a freshly forked Shibarium, where community tokens can flourish,” said Shiba Inu Lead Developer Shytoshi Kusama in a statement. “ This new UX is still an early Shibaswap version, with more updates in the pipeline for the product.”

Total transactions on the Shibarium network have now surpassed over 400 million. Last month, developers introduced Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to the SHIB blockchain ecosystem – a technology for improving user privacy.
The price of SHIB rose 3% on Wednesday, alongside Bitcoin (BTC). Meanwhile, BONE – the governance token of the ShibaSwap exchange – pumped by 7.6%.

DOJ charges brothers for stealing $25 million in crypto in 12 seconds

Image: LightRocket (Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Justice has arrested two brothers for attacking the Ethereum blockchain and stealing $25 million worth of cryptocurrency within 12 seconds, it said in an unsealed indictment on Wednesday. Why Nvidia needs to deliver on Q1 earningsThe indictment is charging Anton Peraire-Bueno, 24, of Boston, and James Pepaire-Bueno, 28, of New York, with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, the agency said. The DOJ said the duo allegedly committed a “first-of-its-kind manipulation” of the Ethereum blockchain. In doing so, they were able to redirect pending transactions to ultimately steal $25 million in cryptocurrency. “As we allege, the defendants’ scheme calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question,”  said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. The DOJ said that because the Peraire-Bueno brothers studied computer science and math at “one of the most prestigious universities in the world,” their education could have helped them carry out the scheme. If convicted, the Peraire-Bueno brothers each face a maximum of 20 years in prison for each of three counts they are being charged with, the DOJ said. Charges against the brothers come also come amid deliberations of whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will move to approve an Ethereum exchange-traded-fund (ETFs). The ruling, scheduled for later this year, would let investors gain exposure to ether tokens without directly owning the cryptocurrency.

Crypto Brokerage Firm Falcon Labs Set To Pay Over $1,768,000 in Settlement With CFTC - The Daily Hodl


								The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is ordering the Seychelles-registered cryptocurrency brokerage firm Falcon Labs to pay nearly $2 million to settle regulatory violations.
CFTC says that Falcon Labs failed to properly register with the regulator and will consequently pay a total of $1,768,512 in the regulator’s first action against an unregistered futures commission merchant (FCM).










“Falcon Labs is ordered to cease and desist from acting as an unregistered FCM by providing U.S. persons access to digital asset derivatives trading platforms. The order also requires Falcon Labs to pay $1,179,008 in disgorgement and a $589,504 civil monetary penalty.”
According to the CFTC, the crypto brokerage firm “solicited or accepted orders” from US-based customers from around October 2021 to at least March 27th of 2023.
“Throughout this period, Falcon Labs functioned as an intermediary facilitating customer trading on various digital asset exchanges, including institutional customers located in the U.S. Falcon Labs provided its customers with direct access to exchanges by first creating a main account in its own name and then creating associated sub-accounts. The exchanges generally did not require, and Falcon Labs generally did not provide, customer-identifying information for the sub-account holders.”
Falcon Labs’ settlement comes a little over a week since the chair of the CFTC, Rostin Behnam, warned that the cryptocurrency industry will “probably see in the next six to 18 months or six to 24 months another cycle of enforcement actions”.

GameStop Frenzy Paves Way for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Prices to Skyrocket, Analysts Argue ⋆ ZyCrypto


            
            
Advertisement

&nbsp

&nbsp
The cryptocurrency and stock markets are abuzz with speculation of a memecoin and meme stock revival, fueled by the surprise return of renowned trader Keith Gill alias “Roaring Kitty”, who ignited the infamous GameStop frenzy in 2021.



On Monday, Gill posted a cryptic meme on X (similar to Twitter), sending shockwaves through the stock market world. The post, depicting a gamer leaning intently into a controller, was interpreted by many as a bullish signal for meme stocks and crypto assets.



This sentiment translated into immediate action. GameStop (GME) shares skyrocketed by over 100% at one point, triggering multiple trading halts on the Nasdaq due to overwhelming demand. Notably, in 2021, Gill’s social media activity spurred a legion of retail investors into GameStop, causing its stock price to surge over 1,000% in a single month.



The ripple effects extended to the memecoin space. Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 5.2%, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) also saw a 5.5% increase. Notably, Dogecoin skyrocketed roughly 8,000% in early 2021 following the GME rally before retracing.



Following GME’s latest spike, analysts are divided on whether a full-blown memecoin resurgence is imminent. Some, like Josh Gilbert a analyst for eToro, believe the current economic climate, with rising interest rates and global inflation, is vastly different from the loose monetary policies of 2021 that fueled the initial meme frenzy.

&nbsp



However, others remain optimistic. Chris, a WEB3 Content Creator and head of Marketing at BTCFrontierFund, points to the potential for a “meme coin supercycle” fueled by nostalgia and the ease of access provided by platforms like Robinhood, which recently integrated with decentralized exchange Uniswap.



“Will GME Lead the Memecoin Supercycle? The legend himself has returned. While GameStop was his focus, this led to a cultural meme movement. This was the time we ACTUALLY saw crypto onboarding. DOGE did a 100x in 3 months. We’ve already seen millionaires made overnight last night,” Chris stated, “but there’s so much more opportunity out there.”



Elsewhere Trader OSF, followed by 193,000 Twitter users, added fuel to the speculation, tweeting, “Study the banana zone of $DOGE in Q1 2021 right after the GME mania as ‘meme power’ continued into crypto. If GME is sustained then odds are we are on the precipice of another big memecoin frenzy in crypto. The two are not unrelated.”



That said, GME continued to remain a focal point for traders. The stock surging on Tuesday reached as high as $65 before retracing to approximately $48 on the closing bell. Elsewhere, DOGE and SHIB, the predominant meme tokens based on market capitalization, exhibited resilience, with each experiencing increases of 1.01% and 1.82%, respectively, over the past 24 hours.

Crypto Rallies Off Inflation | Bankless


Cooling Inflation. Crypto assets popped this morning off of key inflation signals from April. What did the data say, and why have markets interpreted it as a sign to buy?Although Tuesday’s producer price index (PPI) release showed inflation running slightly hotter than expected during the month prior, today’s CPI statistics released came in-line with analyst expectations.Inflation remains sticky and is still running above the Federal Reserve’s long-term 2% target, but this was the first time the CPI decreased in the past three months; meanwhile, retail sales are showing increasing signs of stagnation.Despite month-to-month fluctuations in inflation data coming with a fair amount of noise, it is clear to see deflation continues to set in as higher prices have come to weigh on the demand component of the economy.
After the data release, markets began pricing in the increased likelihood of interest rate cuts to combat the declining economic situation, sending yields on US Treasuries retracing back to their March highs and indicating that traders are, in fact, gearing up for these inevitable rate cuts.Disinflation may be present, but it has not yet reached concerning territory, allowing market participants to operate on assumptions that future rate cuts are unequivocally bullish, as their decline decreases the risk-free rate and theoretically bolsters the relative attractiveness of risk assets.With further confirmation that the future path of interest rates is downwards, market participants slammed the bid on crypto assets, causing the price of Bitcoin to jump 5% on the day; BTC managed to break the downtrend that had encumbered price since April, but was unable to reclaim $65k and remains suppressed by weekly resistance at this level.Source: TradingViewUnlike range-bound crypto assets, traditional equities have climbed steadily for the past two and a half weeks, allowing today’s CPI print to provide the fuel needed for stock indexes to achieve new all-time highs!Both the broad market S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 gapped through their prior ATHs set in March on the open of US cash markets and proceeded to run throughout the morning alongside other risk assets.America’s Federal Reserve can exert massive amounts of pressure on the short end of the interest rate curve, but fundamentally, these rates are priced from a combination of future growth and inflation expectations.While the prevailing wisdom adopted by many market participants leads them to believe that lower interest rates are bullish for risk assets, they are only one factor in the broader economic equation, and it remains highly doubtful that cuts will be potent enough to stimulate faltering growth, considering the lowest interest rate levels have coincided with peak recessionary conditions in past cycles.In the absence of clear growth catalysts, monetary and fiscal policymakers may yet again resort to currency debasement, and even though the real economic impact of such actions are uncertain, they would be nearly guaranteed to increase the dollar-value prices of hard assets insulated from inflationary fiat schemes, like Bitcoin and gold.

Is GameStop Trader Roaring Kitty Actually Back-Or Are We Being Punked? - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsAfter years of silence, the apparent return online this week of meme stock influencer Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, has sent stocks and crypto assets affiliated with the streamer’s past exploits soaring—creating millions of dollars in profit for lucky traders out of thin air. But is Roaring Kitty actually back? So far, only Gill’s Twitter account has reactivated since Sunday, posting scores of movie clips re-subtitled with finance-related captions—vintage Roaring Kitty. Before this week, the account had not posted since 2021, the same year that Gill became a global sensation for architecting the Reddit-fueled short squeeze of GameStop stock (GME). Roaring Kitty’s Twitter account has not, however, posted any recents photos or videos of Gill himself, who once regularly filmed himself talking about meme stocks for hours at a time. The influencer’s YouTube and Reddit accounts, once staples of his non-stop posting operation, also remain dormant. They have also not seen any activity since 2021. Decrypt reached out to Gill via multiple channels, but did not receive a response.Despite the lack of clarity surrounding Gill’s apparent resurfacing, tweets from the Roaring Kitty Twitter account have sparked a stock market and crypto phenomenon. GME stock nearly quadrupled in value within a period of two days, before falling back to earth this morning. AMC, another popular meme stock, followed roughly the same trajectory. A Solana meme coin called GME, meanwhile, surged to all-time highs yesterday on the development, before slipping today. Those moves have collectively generated several billions of dollars worth of value. But the lack of verification surrounding Roaring Kitty’s return has also created opportunities for confusion. Shl0ms, a digital artist who has previously incorporated misinformation in his works, posted an image on Monday purporting to reveal that he purchased Roaring Kitty’s Twitter account from the influencer in late April. Some Twitter users appeared to take the post seriously; others played it off as a meta joke, which it almost certainly is. After all, the pseudonymous artist famously "hoaxed the world" earlier this year, convincing large swaths of the internet that Google was set to kill off its Gmail service.But the fact that Keith Gill hasn't actually uttered a single word in public in three years, nor reactivated any of his social media accounts other than Twitter, leaves room for doubt—and room for pranksters to have a little fun.When Decrypt asked Shl0ms whether he actually controls the Roaring Kitty Twitter account, or is pretending to in order to generate meta commentary, as he’s done before, the artist replied: “Both.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Tokenized Treasuries Will Bring TradFi On-Chain: S&P Global - DailyCoin


        

S&P Global Ratings bets on tokenized treasuries.



Cites Blackrock’s BUIDL fund as proof of the trend. 



Tokenized treasuries use public blockchains like Ethereum.




Crypto supporters have long anticipated the integration of traditional finance and blockchain. According to the financial analytics firm S&P Global, this may soon become a reality. 



The firm has recently highlighted the growing importance of asset tokenization, tokenized treasuries in particular. These digital tokens, backed by U.S. government obligations, are gaining traction among institutional investors.



Tokenized Treasuries Are Gaining Traction: S&P Global



On Tuesday, May 14, financial analytics firm S&P Global published a report on Tokenized Treasuries, focusing on their potential to transform financial markets. Tokenized Treasuries are digital tokens created on blockchains like Ethereum but also backed by U.S. government obligations. 




The firm claims significant momentum is behind Tokenized Treasuries, which so far amassed over $1 billion in outstanding value. For instance, Blackrock’s BUIDL fund, introduced in March this year, attracted over $240 million in investments within the same week. 



Blackrock’s BUIDL fund currently stands at $381 million. It works on the Ethereum blockchain and allows investors to redeem their shares for USDC stablecoin without intermediaries. Similarly, Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX fund has enabled peer-to-peer transfers of tokens on Stellar and Polygon blockchains. 



These developments show that mainstream financial institutions are starting to understand the benefits of tokenized assets, especially treasuries. 



What Are the Benefits of Tokenized Treasuries 



According to S&P Global, tokenized treasuries offer several benefits compared to traditional treasuries. These mainly center around greater liquidity, especially during market volatility. In particular, when many investors seek to redeem their shares simultaneously, they expose the fund to liquidity risks. 




In contrast, Tokenized Treasuries, such as Blackrock’s BUIDL fund, provide investors with continuous access to liquidity on-chain. Moreover, investors can use their Tokenized Treasuries as collateral rather than redeeming their shares, reducing the risk of a fund run.



Another benefit of tokenized treasuries for traditional investors is faster settlement and easier international fund transfers. Investors can easily convert these treasuries to digital assets on public blockchains and send them across the globe faster and with less oversight than traditional finance.   



However, S&P Global also foresees some challenges with tokenized treasuries. For one, interoperability is a major concern, as investors may need to transfer their funds from one chain to another. Similarly, regulatory issues, particularly with stablecoins, remain a major potential roadblock for further adoption. 



On the Flipside




Back in July 2023, investors had already poured $600 million into tokenized treasuries. 



Various blockchains are competing for the tokenized treasury market. For instance, Switzerland-based Backed Finance recently expanded its tokenized US treasury offering to Base. 




Why This Matters



Tokenized treasuries showcase the use cases of blockchain in traditional finance. Critically, they use public blockchains like Ethereum and Base rather than private blockchains managed directly by banks.

The Protocol: Lido Backers vs EigenLayer

MEME RUSH! An industry source told me over margaritas a few weeks ago, "You're starting to hear venture capital firms make the argument that meme coins are becoming an investable asset class." What's undeniable is that meme coins are popping, and there does appear to be a thriving industry in promoting them. In April alone, CoinMarketCap added 138 meme coins to its listings, versus 18 in the same month a year earlier, bringing the total to 2,229, with a market capitalization of more than $50 billion, as reported by our Omkar Godbole. Last week, VanEck, a crypto-friendly institutional investment firm, started a new Meme Coin Index, tracking prices of doggy-themed tokens dogecoin (DOGE) and dogwifhat (WIF) as well as other ridiculousness like BONK. Another dog token, FLOKI, shared the title sponsorship for a cricket series between Pakistan and Ireland. Crypto analysts are talking up the election-related meme coins TRUMP and BODEN, and tokens associated with the X-Men character Wolverine flooded several blockchains after TheRoaringKitty, the personality behind the GameStop meme stock frenzy, posted a related video on X. Even independent Bitcoin programmer Jimmy Song, often a vocal critic of non-Bitcoin token creation, wrote in a Substack post that he appreciated the "honesty" of the movement: "Meme coins obsoleted the VCs and ultimately brought some more honesty to the Nietzschean will-to-power games that were always being played." Speaking of Bitcoin, the OG blockchain now has meme coins too, many of them created with the Runes protocol launched last month. Sovryn, a decentralized trading platform with Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and secured by Bitcoin through merge-mining on the Rootstock sidechain, announced Wednesday that it has created a fully-premined rune called POWA, airdropped the tokens to users and established pools for trading them. "Runes provide a way for projects to create and distribute tokens natively on the Bitcoin blockchain for memes," Sovryn said in a press release.

US indicts Ethereum validators for exploiting MEV trader


Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno, two brothers who operate Ethereum validators, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
The charges related to a scheme that has been described as exploiting the ‘very integrity of the Ethereum Blockchain to fraudulently obtain approximately $25 million.’
The brothers allegedly worked together on a complex exploit that allowed them to take advantage of traders searching for ‘maximum extractable value’ (MEV) on Ethereum. 
By operating multiple Ethereum validators, the brothers were allegedly able to submit blocks that included exploited transactions.
Allegedly, once the brothers were aware that their validators would soon have opportunities to submit blocks, they would create ‘bait’ transactions that seemed to have significant upside for the MEV traders and wait for those traders to attempt to ‘sandwich’ their trades.
These sandwich bots will often look for transactions with the potential for arbitrage and place transactions that buy shortly before and sell shortly after.
When the traders were baited into submitting these ‘bundles’ of transactions, the brothers allegedly submitted a fake signature to MEV-Boost Relay, which at the time resulted in the relays prematurely releasing the whole proposed block.
They then allegedly took advantage of the fact that they were operating validators to disassemble the block and allow the traders to still front-run. However, instead of buying the asset the MEV trader believes they are interested in, they actually sold that asset at the higher price.

This technique did potentially put their validators at risk of slashing, but the $25 million they were able to take outweighed the economic costs.
The indictment additionally details some of the steps the brothers allegedly took to plan for the exploit and to launder the funds once received. This allegedly included creating an ‘exploit plan’ that broke down the exploit into four steps:

The bait
Unblinding the block
The search
The propagation

After the exploit, the brothers turned to internet searches to manage the risk of their decisions, allegedly searching for:

‘Top crypto lawyers’
‘How long is US statute of limitations’
‘Wire fraud statute/wire fraud statute of limitations’
‘Money laundering statute of limitations’
‘Computer fraud abuse act’
‘Does the United States extradite to’

In order to help clean the funds they received from this exploit, the brothers allegedly transferred some to a ‘second-layer exploit address,’ which was subsequently frozen. Much of the remainder, totaling approximately $22 million, was converted to Dai, a stablecoin.
After going through a lending protocol, this Dai was allegedly exchanged for Circle’s stablecoin USDC. These funds were then allegedly transferred to an exchange account controlled by Pine Needle Inc., the company set up by the brothers, before being transferred again to a bank account associated with their business.
This indictment represents the first time that anybody has been indicted in the United States on fraud charges related to changing the expected ordering of transactions on Ethereum.

Huobi HK pulls its HTX Hong Kong License application, raising questions about the company's future in the region.
                        Huobi Global (HGBL) Hong Kong Limited, a subsidiary of HTX, withdrew its application for a cryptocurrency trading license from Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) for the second time on May 14.HTX’s Huobi HK Withdraws Hong Kong License Bid Again
Huobi HK is no longer on the SFC’s list of virtual asset trading platform applicants, indicating it has withdrawn its application again. This decision came just two months after Huobi HK had re-submitted its application on February 26, following an initial withdrawal three days prior.Hong Kong had released a regulatory deadline that required crypto exchanges to obtain a license or cease operations in the region by the end of May if they failed to apply by February 29.Hong Kong has been actively fostering its reputation as a crypto hub since June 2022 by permitting licensed exchanges to offer retail trading services. To date, only two platforms, HashKey and OSL, have secured licenses from Hong Kong regulators. The SFC has also issued warnings against websites falsely claiming to be regulated exchanges.The SFC’s website indicates that numerous major global crypto exchanges, including OKX, Bybit, Bullish, and Crypto.com, are still undergoing the licensing process. The SFC is currently reviewing 20 such applications.Despite Hong Kong’s apparent attractiveness, some crypto firms have abandoned the market. Huobi HK’s recent withdrawal marks the second time the company has pulled its application.The SFC has not offered an explanation for these repeated withdrawals. This lack of clarity further fuels doubts about the exchange’s ability to operate successfully in Hong Kong.Huobi HK’s actions mirror a similar move by crypto platform HKVAEX, which ceased operations on May 1 after withdrawing its license bid in March. HKVAEX was reportedly linked to Binance.Setback for Huobi’s Global Expansion
The withdrawal of Huobi HK’s HTX Hong Kong License application presents a significant obstacle for Huobi Global (HTX), a major crypto exchange that ranks among the top five globally by 24-hour trading volume, according to CoinGecko data.In early 2023, HTX advisor and crypto influencer Justin Sun announced the company’s plan to launch a new Hong Kong-based exchange, Huobi Hong Kong, to meet the city’s updated crypto regulations. In February 2024, an HTX representative clarified that Huobi HK operates independently from its parent company.Huobi HK’s late February resubmission was reportedly an attempt to avoid shutting down operations on June 1, as stipulated by the new virtual asset regulatory regime implemented in 2022.Although only a few international crypto companies met the application deadline, the Hong Kong market was seen as a desirable location for firms with Chinese roots that relocated abroad following Beijing’s industry crackdown.

Major Development: Giant Company Reports $5.2 Billion Bitcoin Spot ETF Purchase to SEC - Bitcoin Sistemi

Boothbay Fund Management, a well-known and respected investment firm based in New York, announced its significant investments in Bitcoin ETFs. The disclosure came in the form of a 13F filing, a three-month requirement by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in eligible assets.
The filing revealed that Boothbay has made significant investments in several Bitcoin ETFs. The assets owned by the company are as follows:


BlackRock Bitcoin ETF: $149,803,752 (3,701,600 shares)
Fidelity Bitcoin ETF: $105,502,000 (1,700,000 shares)





Grayscale BTC: $69,487,000 (1,100,000 shares)
Bitwise Bitcoin ETF: $52,258,500 (1,350,000 shares)



The total value of all reported 13F positions is a staggering $5.2 billion. With these investments, Boothbay emerged as the reported largest shareholder of BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise ETFs.
13F filing is a very important requirement for large investment firms. This mandate requires them to disclose their holdings in U.S.-traded stocks, options and now BTC ETFs as of the last day of the quarter. This obligation ensures transparency in financial markets and allows investors to follow the investment activities of large institutional investors.

FLOKI Price Explodes: Here Are 4 Reasons Why


																TL;DR

Floki Inu (FLOKI) has experienced a significant price increase recently, coinciding with the general upswing in the meme coin market.
A proposal from the Floki DAO to burn over 15 billion tokens aims to increase scarcity and potentially boost the value of the asset.


What’s Fueling FLOKI’s Ascent?
The popular meme coin – Floki Inu (FLOKI) – recently experienced a substantial price increase, spiking by 17% on a 24-hour scale and 32% weekly. Currently, it trades at around $0.0002222 (per CoinGecko’s data), a figure last observed at the start of April.

FLOKI Price, Source: CoinGecko
One factor possibly contributing to FLOKI’s rally is the overall resurgence of the meme coin sector. As CryptoPotato reported, PEPE hit a new all-time high today (May 15), while Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk Inu (BONK), and many others are well in the green.
The next element worth mentioning is the rising adoption of FLOKI. The global neobank and financial technology company – Revolut – added the asset to its business program, while Binance Thailand also allowed trading services with it.
“This listing will significantly enhance accessibility to FLOKI in Thailand and help accelerate its vision of being the world’s most known and most used cryptocurrency,” the team behind the meme coin argued.
Last but not least, the Floki DAO introduced a proposal on whether or not to burn over 15 billion tokens. Removing a substantial amount of assets from circulation will make FLOKI scarcer and potentially more valuable in time (assuming demand stays the same or increases). Another meme coin that has adopted a similar burning mechanism is the second-largest by market capitalization – Shiba Inu (SHIB).




Is There More Room for Growth?
Despite the recent price surge, multiple analysts believe FLOKI is just gearing up for a real bull run. The X user Nite thinks the asset’s chart has flashed a “buy signal” for the first time since February. Another member of the social media platform described the breakout as “expected,” envisioning additional pump to as high as $0.00065.
FLOKI is currently the fifth-biggest meme coin, with a market cap of over $2 billion. The ones leading the pack are Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and dogwifhat (WIF).

Solana Value Spikes 5.46% to $149: What Happened Behind the Scene


							

For the first time, Solana outpaced the Ethereum network regarding profitability.



Solana’s economic value exceeded $2.2 million, while that of Ethereum was low at $1.98 million.



Following the news, SOL saw an upsurge to $149 from the earlier low of $141.




Solana (SOL) blockchain has, for the first time, outpaced the Ethereum network in terms of profitability, causing SOL’s value to surge. On-chain analyst Dan Smith brought attention to this significant event in a recent post on X. He noted that Solana’s economic value has exceeded $2.2 million. In comparison, Ethereum’s economic value sits at around $1.98 million.







The chart accompanying the update shows the economic value generated by both Solana and Ethereum from February 14 to May 12, 2024. This value is calculated based on transaction fees and miner extractable value (MEV). 



Ethereum’s economic value reached a high of $40 million in late February but experienced a decline, eventually stabilizing between $10 million and $15 million in April. By May 12, it had dipped to just under $2 million.



In contrast, Solana’s economic value started significantly lower than Ethereum — its values were around $1 million. However, it registered a steady increase through March and surpassed Ethereum by the end of the observed period, closing at approximately $2.25 million on May 12.









The crypto industry has reacted to these developments with various insights. Toghrul Maharramov from Scroll ZKP pointed out that Ethereum’s MEV remained relatively stable. However, transaction fees dropped following the EIP-4844 implementation, which impacted Ethereum’s economic value. 



While Solana has overtaken Ethereum’s mainchain in profitability, analysts argue that it does not take into account Ethereum’s role as fuel across its various Layer 2 networks.



SOL 24-hour chart | CoinMarketCap



Remarkably, the news of this historic milestone for Solana impacted SOL’s market value. Solana had been languishing with bearish performance over the last 24 hours. However, it registered a swift and pronounced uptick in the last few hours, putting its intraday peak at $149.15. The trajectory reflects a 5.46% upsurge, considering SOL traded at a low of $141.42 earlier.

U.S. House's McHenry Says Senate May Be Swayed if Many Democrats Back Crypto Bill

The thing to watch, he suggested, is if a lot of Democrats show up to support the bill.

McHenry, who is set to retire at the end of the year, has made digital assets legislation a top priority for the end of his time on Capitol Hill. To that end, the House has recorded a number of recent cryptocurrency successes, from the passage of several relevant bills through McHenry's committee to the advancement of a congressional effort to overturn Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crypto accounting policies.

But chief among the House's digital assets endeavors is the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, which is heading toward a long-awaited vote for final approval in the House of Representatives in the coming days. That's the most comprehensive U.S. crypto bill to move this far through Congress and, if it's approved in a bipartisan vote in the House, will represent a high-water mark for the industry's efforts in Washington.

Crypto Token Tsunami: 1M New Projects Added in April - DailyCoin


        

Almost 1 million new crypto tokens were created last month.



This rate of growth far exceeds anything seen before in the industry.



There are doubts about the usefulness and quality of new projects.   




As a niche offering, cryptocurrency has long suffered from an image of breeding scams, illicit financing, and speculative excess. However, despite these challenges, the industry has defied skeptics and grown into a multi-trillion-dollar market in 15 years. With legacy finance cautiously embracing digital assets, the path to mainstream acceptance and further growth looks assured. 




As a demonstration of the industry’s remarkable growth trajectory, the number of new crypto tokens released in April topped almost one million, exhibiting the innovative spirit and entrepreneurial drive fueling the industry’s development.



New Crypto Tokens Explode in April



The number of newly created crypto tokens in April topped nearly 1 million, signaling an unprecedented surge in growth for the digital asset industry. Coinbase director Conor Grogan highlighted the scale of this growth, stating that the number of new crypto tokens created last month was twice that launched on the Ethereum blockchain between 2015 and 2023.







Grogan attached a chart from Dune Analytics illustrating the magnitude of the increase in new token offerings. It focused on Ethereum and several of its layer 2s only, with Base contributing the largest portion of new token additions by a considerable margin.



The growth of the cryptocurrency market can be attributed to increasing investor interest, both from retail and institutional players, as well as a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as alternative assets.



According to CoinMarketCap, there are now over 2.4 million crypto projects in existence, a remarkable feat considering the industry’s relatively short lifespan. However, despite the sheer quantity of crypto projects on the market, there is overwhelming doubt about the quality and utility of most of these tokens.



Quality Over Quantity



Chiming in on the matter, X influencer DonAlt expressed his doubts about the quality of tokens on the market, stating that 99.99% are doomed to fail. Echoing this sentiment, trader Dead Cat Bounce singled out the plethora of Solana-based “sh*tcoins,” criticizing them as existing primarily to scam investors and enrich the founders of these projects.




Two years ago, when the number of crypto tokens on the market stood at around 19,000, Ripple boss Brad Garlinghouse drew attention to the excessiveness of the situation, pointing out that there are only 180 fiat currencies worldwide.



With the current number of crypto tokens exceeding 2.4 million, over 120 times the figure from two years ago, it is fair to say that most of these tokens are simply cluttering cyberspace.



On the Flipside




Off-the-shelf solutions to create crypto tokens exist, lowering the barrier to entry and contributing to token proliferation.



As the industry matures, token projects with strong fundamentals and real-world use cases will rise to the top over the long term.




Why This Matters



The influx of one million new crypto tokens last month is a double-edged sword for the industry. On one hand, it signifies the immense interest and potential for innovation in the digital asset space. However, it also raises questions about the quality and utility of these tokens, the risk of market manipulation, and regulatory gaps.

Bitcoin: This Signal Turns Bullish After 3 Months, Will BTC Shake Off Weakness And Roar?


								Bitcoin prices are firm, steady above $60,000 despite the ultra-high selling pressure that saw it dump double digits from all-time highs. Despite the current development, one analyst, @el_crypto_prof, is bullish, predicting a welcomed price surge based on the BBWP indicator’s development. 
Signal Flashes Blue, Time To Buy Bitcoin?
Taking to X, the analyst noted that the BBWP indicator had printed a “blue bar” on the daily chart. Looking back, this suggests that prices could be preparing for a strong run in the weeks ahead. 
BTC uptrend remains | Source: @el_crypto_prof via X
Confidence is high because prices spiked higher the last time a “blue bar” was printed. This signal has been printed two times before. The first time was in October 2023 and January 2024. The last leg signal printed in January was the basis of BTC soaring above 2021 highs of around $70,000. As mentioned earlier, BTC prices spiked by roughly 80% in both instances.

Beyond this, the analyst also observed that the bullish trend line remains intact, further bolstering the bullish outlook. For this reason, the trader remains upbeat, saying there is a probability of BTC soaring above the immediate liquidation levels to $100,000. 
Still, BTC is not guaranteed to rally, aligning with historical performances. Technical indicators like the BBWP tend to lag, depending on “past” price actions to print signals. In the BBWP’s case, volatility is derived from past price action generated by the popular Bollinger Bands (BB). 
BTC bulls have failed to take over, pushing prices higher, as in Q1 2024. Market-wide factors have been considered, such as slowing down the upside momentum. 
CEO Expects BTC To Range, Vanguard Hires New Executive
Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, is not bullish. Speaking on Galaxy Digital’s Q1 2024 earnings call, the CEO believes prices will continue consolidating, ranging between $55,000 and $75,000 in the next few weeks. By Novogratz’s estimation, BTC might post a conclusive break higher by June 2023–or the end of Q2 2024.

The CEO also added that dwindling inflows via spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) shouldn’t be a concern. Overall, there appears to be broader adoption among institutions, a massive endorsement for the coin and the sector.
Comments came with news that Vanguard, an asset manager, appointed Salim Ramji, a former BlackRock executive. The community says Ramji is Bitcoin-friendly and oversaw the launch of BlackRock’s IBIT earlier this year.

Ramji replaces Tim Buckley, a BTC critic. Still, whether Vanguard will reconsider its position on BTC and even initiate plans to issue spot Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock or Fidelity remains to be seen.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Buy The Blood, Snatch Up 70,000 BTC


																Glassnode data has revealed that Bitcoin long-term holders are taking advantage of the cryptocurrency’s lower price to significantly increase their holdings. This accumulation further strengthens the belief that this group of Bitcoin investors anticipate a potential upside for Bitcoin despite its recent volatility. 
Long-Term Holders Pay $4.3 Billion For 70,000 BTC
According to Glassnode, long-term Bitcoin holders who had previously sold 1 billion BTC in the latter part of 2023 are accumulating once again. This buying activity could be interpreted as a potential bullish signal for Bitcoin. 

	Related Reading



Traditionally, Bitcoin long-term holders sell their holdings during peak prices and buy new tokens during periods of correction or substantial declines. When these seasoned investors buy cryptocurrencies during market lows, it usually indicates their expectations of a potential rebound, leading to profits. 
On the other hand, short-term holders are known to buy cryptocurrencies during sporadic price surges, often signaling that a cryptocurrency is nearing its peak. 
With Bitcoin presently stabilizing above $61,000, long-term Bitcoin holders probably see the cryptocurrency’s value as a prime buying opportunity. They have recently added a staggering 70,000 BTC valued at over $4.3 billion to their holdings.  
Source: Glassnode
This sentiment for Bitcoin’s potential rally is also shared by a few crypto analysts who have predicted that the cryptocurrency would surge to new all-time highs during the approaching bull market. Earlier in March, before Bitcoin’s halving event, the cryptocurrency skyrocketed above $73,000, marking a new historic all-time high. 
With the bull market still on the way, Bitcoin could see further upsides as market conditions improve and investor demand rises. This could potentially lead to profits for long term holders who had purchased the cryptocurrency earlier. 
Moreover, the upcoming United States inflation report, set for release on May 15, could also be another primary factor driving long-term investors’ substantial BTC accumulation. With the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) remaining historically high, and the Federal Reserve (FED) unchanged rates, Bitcoin is seen as a possible hedge against inflationary pressures, protecting investors’ wealth against decline.  
Bitcoin Whales Display Opposite Trend
Reports from blockchain analytics platform Santiment reveal that Bitcoin whales are showing an opposite trend from long-term holders. 
The analytics platform noted that Bitcoin whales appear to be taking a break from accumulating BTC, as the number of large-scale transactions has been decreasing significantly. 

	Related Reading



This trend coincides with the cryptocurrency’s reduced on-chain activities and its declining value over the past few weeks.
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has also shared a similar report, emphasizing that Bitcoin’s accumulation trend score is currently displaying a value closer to zero, indicating that larger investors were distributing their holdings rather than buying. 
Despite the downtrend, Martinez has disclosed that Bitcoin’s current TD sequential is signaling a buying opportunity and the cryptocurrency was poised for a rebound soon. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency’s price is trading below $62,000, receiving a decrease of about 6.38% in the last month, according to CoinMarketCap.

Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Calls Out SEC for ‘Gaslighting’ Crypto Project, Says Practice Should Not Stand - The Daily Hodl


								Coinbase’s chief legal officer thinks the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is “gaslighting” the US courts and the crypto sector.
Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal calls attention to the SEC’s case against Digital Licensing Inc., a Utah-based company that was doing business under the name “DEBT Box.”










“In a brief to avoid dismissal of its case against Debt Box with prejudice, the SEC includes a remarkable admission that it did not follow its own typical Wells process when it refused to tell us what assets would be charged as securities: ‘The Wells process is designed to aid the charging decision for a specific potential defendant. The SEC staff typically provides a thorough explanation of the evidence it would use to prove potential charges against a particular person or entity.'” 
A Wells notice is a warning issued by the SEC that indicates the regulator is planning to pursue legal action against a company. Coinbase received one in March 2023, a few months before the regulator launched a lawsuit against the exchange for allegedly violating securities laws.
Grewal argues that Coinbase’s Wells notice didn’t include an explanation of what crypto assets were linked to securities transactions.
“We weren’t told what assets were at issue at all. Why would the government not follow its ‘typical’ process in our case, and what does that say about its claims?”
The SEC sent a Wells notice to Robinhood’s crypto trading arm earlier this month and Uniswap Labs in April. The regulator has also launched lawsuits against Binance and Kraken, accusing both exchanges of violating securities laws.

Mastercard, Standard Chartered test tokenized deposit transaction

Mastercard and Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong (SCBHK) have completed the first live test of Mastercard’s Multi-Token Network (MTN). They ran a proof-of-concept pilot that tokenized carbon credits within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Fintech Supervisory Sandbox.In the project, a client of SCBHK’s virtual bank, Mox Bank, deposited funds into Mox and requested to buy a carbon credit. Mox requested that SCBHK tokenize the carbon credit through tokenization service provider Libeara, launched in Standard Chartered’s venture arm SC Ventures. MTN tokenized the deposit, and an atomic swap — a real-time swap that takes place across different blockchains — of the two tokens was performed. Related: Hong Kong regulator issues tokenized investments requirements amid demandMastercard launched the MTN in June 2023. It was built on Mastercard’s private blockchain.

Ethereum, Solana and One More ETH-Rival Will Benefit From Rise of Artificial Intelligence: Real Vision Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts believes Bitcoin (BTC) and a certain breed of altcoins will be beneficiaries of artificial intelligence’s (AI) rise to prominence.
The former Bloomberg analyst tells his 16,200 followers on the social media platform X that AI will need a money system, and that BTC may be the best available form.










However, Coutts says that stablecoins and the native tokens of smart contract platforms, such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and NEAR, are also well-suited.
“AI needs a money.
Bitcoin is the best form factor, but it won’t be the only one. Stablecoins and native tokens for smart contract platforms will also see widespread use.
SOL ETH NEAR.”
Coutts recently said that artificial intelligence (AI) technology could send the total market cap of the layer-1 crypto sector soaring from the current $1.9 trillion valuation to as high as $25 trillion by 2030.
The analyst shares an excerpt from his firm’s Pro-Crypto November 2023 report that suggests AI will increase the demand for on-chain verification and authentication services.
The report also says that human-directed or autonomous AI agents could make use of smart contract platforms to exchange value, significantly increasing the growth rate.
“By incorporating an ‘AI growth factor’ starting in 2026, which adds 10% to the annual growth rate, we can begin to gauge this impact. Initially, the effect is modest, but by 2030, AI agents could comprise over 40% of total daily active users (DAU). This obviously creates some rather astronomical valuations for the blockchain assets, which will benefit from the transaction fees generated by an increasing number of AI agents.”

Why Did Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally Today? What Can Happen Next? Here's What Analysts Say - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bitcoin experienced its most significant increase since March after the April consumer price index (CPI) was announced, which showed that the inflation rate in the United States had decreased. BTC price increased significantly along with US stocks today.
The consumer price index (CPI), a comprehensive measure of the cost of goods and services at the point of sale, rose 0.3% from March, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. This figure was slightly below Dow Jones' estimate of 0.4%. Despite this, consumer prices continue to increase by 3.4% on an annual basis.


Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau stated that the CPI being slightly lower than expected increases the possibility of an interest rate cut. He noted that interest rate cuts continue to have a strong impact on Bitcoin's price. “After ETFs and the halving, the next big catalyst is a rate cut. Until we see a clearer path for a rate cut, Bitcoin is likely to stick with macro data points and trade alongside them,” he said.

According to analysts, the decline in core CPI in the US for the first time in six months may lead to a revival in investors' appetite for riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies. This could lead to an increase in flows into Bitcoin spot ETFs, which have been particularly inactive over the past week, according to 21Shares analyst Leena ElDeeb.





However, ElDeeb added a note of caution, saying the recovery could be slow due to ongoing uncertainty regarding interest rate cuts. “Generally, higher interest rates make risky assets such as technology stocks and Bitcoin less attractive, as investors can earn significant returns from safer options such as U.S. bonds,” ElDeeb said.

Two brothers, Anton Pepaire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno, were arrested for allegedly stealing $25 million in crypto through a sophisticated arbitrage bot exploit on Ethereum.What’s the scoop?The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges Anton and James manipulated MEV-boost, a software used by Ethereum validators, to steal $25M. Today, a federal court unsealed indictments charging the brothers with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.They allegedly targeted maximal extractable value (MEV) bots in a sophisticated 12-second transaction tampering attack that drained $25M in stablecoins and other tokens from a series of liquidity pools. Bankless take:This case is unprecedented in the U.S., as it’s the first time a federal court has handled an incident involving MEV manipulation on Ethereum. Most people in crypto don’t even understand MEV, so it will be key to watch how the U.S. government navigates this complex frontier topic and if similar cases will be forthcoming.Also, this case has notably sparked debate in the crypto community, with some finding it hypocritical that MEV traders can legally launch front-running sandwich attacks while the DOJ has seemingly charged the Peraire-Bueno brothers for front-running sandwich attackers.The distinction lies in the fact that regular MEV users operate within the confines of publicly available information and are bound by various rules. In contrast, the Peraire-Bueno brothers exploited a previously unknown vulnerability in MEV-boost, surpassing these rules and enforcing massive losses rather than less-than-satisfactory trades on other traders.

Humanity Protocol raises $30M for palm-based digital identity - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Humanity Protocol has secured $30M for its palm scan identity verification project.
Palm scan tech offers secure, decentralized identity verification, disrupting traditional methods.
Competition intensifies in the digital identity space as Worldcoin and Humanity Protocol go head-to-head.

Humanity Protocol, a web3 digital identity startup, has secured $30 million in funding, catapulting its valuation to $1 billion.
Utilizing palm scans for online identity verification, digital identity startup aims to revolutionize digital identity management.
Palm scan technology in digital identity verification
Humanity Protocol’s unique approach to digital identity verification involves the use of palm scans.
Unlike traditional methods that rely on usernames and passwords, palm scans utilize infrared cameras to capture the unique vein patterns in an individual’s palm.
This biometric data is then stored using decentralized technology and zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring the security and privacy of users’ information.
Humanity Protocol’s founder, Terence Kwok, emphasized the importance of this approach, stating that palm scans offer a more secure and reliable means of identity verification.
With plans to launch its own cryptocurrency, Humanity Protocol aims to leverage its palm scan technology to streamline know-your-customer (KYC) processes and other identity verification procedures.
Humanity Protocol challenging Worldcoin in digital identity space
Humanity Protocol’s funding success comes amidst increasing competition in the digital identity space.
Projects like Worldcoin, co-founded by Sam Altman, have also sought to revolutionize identity verification using innovative technologies.
However, Worldcoin has faced criticism for its iris-scanning technology and business model targeting users in the Global South.
In response to these concerns, Worldcoin announced that it has established new standards for data protection and has deleted previous iris-scanning data.
Despite these challenges, the growing interest in digital identity solutions underscores the importance of projects like Humanity Protocol in addressing the evolving needs of the digital economy.

USDC issuer Circle plans US move ahead of IPO


Circle Internet Financial Ltd., the entity behind the stablecoin USDC, is set to move its legal headquarters from Ireland to the United States. 



This is aimed at aligning with U.S. financial regulations as the company prepares for an anticipated initial public offering (IPO). 



Circle filed for the IPO in January. The process is subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) review and prevailing market conditions. 



The decision to move Circle’s legal base to the U.S. is made in the context of a complex regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins within the nation. 

	
	
	
	


Circle previously attempted to go public through a US$ 9 billion special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal, a plan that was abandoned in December 2022.



Circle’s USDC has a market capitalization of US$33 billion, second only to Tether’s USDT in stablecoin rankings.



It is also the sixth-largest cryptocurrency in the world, according to CoinGecko data.

GameFi studios are booming once again as crypto prices recover

GameFi projects, the darling of the crypto industry that captivated investors’ attention during the bull run of 2020 to 2022, have made a much-anticipated comeback as Bitcoin (BTC) eyes all-time highs. On May 15, Ethereum Web3 gaming studio Immutable announced the release of its flagship title, Guild of Guardians (GOG), on Google Play and the Apple App Store. Guild of Guardians sees players venture into Elderym, a world on the brink of destruction at the hands of the Dread. To save the world, players assemble a team of Guardians to embark on an adventure fighting through dungeons and bosses while earning GOG token rewards. According to Immutable Games director Chris Clay, the team is planning to showcase the Immutable Passport and Immutable zkEVM. "The past fifteen months of development have been a whirlwind of laying the foundation for a game and universe we’ve only just begun building upon,” he said. As part of the game’s debut, developers have allocated $1 million in GOG tokens and various hero nonfungible tokens (NFTs) as additional rewards. Immutable's Guild of Guardians gameplay: Source: YouTubeElsewhere, Animoca Brands Japan announced on April 22 that the firm would partner with Square Enix, creator of the Final Fantasy series, to develop the latter’s nonfungible token (NFT) hero game Symbiogenesis. “Animoca Brands Japan will support Symbiogenesis by providing its expertise in the overseas expansion of Japanese projects, global NFT sales and marketing activities, and by promoting collaboration opportunities to Animoca Brands' large network of portfolio companies and partners," the company wrote. In Symbiogenesis, players will descend into a devastated high fantasy world and try to solve riddles through missions designed around the theme of monopoly and distribution. The game is playable through any of its 10,000 NFT characters, which also serve the dual purpose of being personal profile pictures. On April 19, Cointelegraph reported that the ARPG classic dark fantasy game Seraph: In the Darkness, built on Arbitrum and developed by Seraph Studio, recently surpassed sales of over 11,000 Ether through multiple in-game NFT sales consisting of heroes, in-game equipment, priority passes, and others. The game is undergoing continuous development and is currently in the preseason phase. Seraph: In the Darkness gameplay. Source: SteamLikewise, on May 13, Pixels, a casual Web3 game that offers an open-ended world of farming and exploration, surpassed 1 million daily active players. It has generated $4.4 million in token revenue over the past month from VIP subscriptions and in-game transactions. In February, the Pixels game surpassed a valuation of $2.7 billion after migration to gaming blockchain Ronin and its token listing on crypto exchange Binance. New projects have dominated the novel and ongoing crypto bull market, as opposed to ones from the previous cycle. Two years prior, fantasy monster battle NFT game Axie Infinity accounted for nearly two-thirds of all blockchain GameFi NFT transactions. At that time, Axie Infinity players amounted to around 2.7 million per month, which has since fallen to 342,353. Related: How AI could ruin gaming, The Voice, addictive Axies game

How Do Utility Tokens Differ to Cryptocurrencies?



                    

Utility tokens are not as good as cryptocurrencies; we will start by saying that. And we are also not saying they are terrible – they definitely have their perks. What we mean is that cryptocurrencies are the real deal. That is where all the real-life applications are.



But do you know the other differences between the two? Read on to find out.




What Are Utility Tokens?



Utility tokens are digital tokens created to generate income for the company and can be used to buy goods or services within a particular network or platform. There are hundreds of utility tokens coming from hundreds of cryptocurrency companies.



Unlike cryptocurrencies – which are general-purpose monies – utility tokens confer ownership rights over a product or service but are often not intended as investments. For example, a utility token might provide access to a cloud storage system or a gaming experience based on blockchains acting as coupons or tickets within specific ecosystems. These tokens may be vital to decentralised applications (dApps) because they facilitate interactions and transactions within the blockchain framework supporting them.



What Are Cryptocurrencies?



Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that utilise cryptography for security purposes and run on decentralised blockchain systems. As of March 2024, there were 13,217 different cryptocurrencies in circulation and over 420 million worldwide crypto users.




In essence, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum were invented as alternatives to traditional fiat currencies and seek to function as a medium of exchange and value stores. They work just like money does. Holders can buy goods or services using them or hold them, expecting their values to increase with time since they are investments. And, beyond their economic application, they provide philosophical benefits like independence from governments’ rules or banks, potentially making money democratically accessible to everyone.



Where Are Utility Tokens and Cryptocurrencies Used?



Cryptocurrencies are generally used in the same way as fiat currencies – to purchase goods and services. Utility tokens, as we’ve seen, are usually more restricted to use within a certain project.



Here are a few examples of how the two are used:



Utility Tokens and Cryptocurrencies in iGaming



Both utility tokens and cryptocurrencies are redefining player experiences and business models in the iGaming industry. Gamers can use utility coins and cryptocurrencies to deposit money and buy in-game perks on most casinos like Crypto Casino (available at https://cryptocasino.ltd/).




What makes them increasingly popular? They provide a universal means of payment on platforms like a crypto poker casino, making depositing and withdrawing across borders simpler and offering extra security and anonymity features. If anything, utility tokens have more use in iGaming than anywhere else.



Utility vs. Cryptos in E-Commerce



As an example in e-commerce, cryptocurrencies are becoming widely accepted as a mode of payment that allows for faster transactions without necessarily requiring traditional banking methods. One study scored e-commerce as the top industry using cryptocurrency. Why? They reduce transaction charges and eliminate geographical boundaries. Who would not want that?



On the other hand, utility tokens can make e-commerce exciting by giving consumers rewards or discounts when they use the platform. The result? More brand loyalty, marketing for the utility coin, etc.



The difference is that people can pay using cryptocurrencies; they would not with utility coins.



What Are The Differences?



The essential disparity between utility tokens and cryptocurrencies lies in how they should be employed and what tasks they can do. Cryptocurrencies aim to replace national currencies in digital form without interference from politics, hence, their decentralised nature makes them secure. But – anyone who knows anything about cryptocurrency will know politics ended up having a lot of influence over the market. Utility tokens do not have even half of the influence on financial markets as cryptocurrencies do.



Utility tokens are usually confined to a specific company or application and can be used for storing value, voting rights, and buying goods or services from the project, but not in any other place as general currency. That is the main difference. And they are distributed through initial coin offerings.



What Are the Similarities?



Utility tokens and cryptocurrencies use the same secure, decentralised network. They share some key features of blockchain technology, like reduced exposure to fraud risks and lower transaction costs compared to traditional financial systems.



Together – these attributes highlight how blockchain could radically alter many sectors by creating more secure, transparent, and efficient means of doing business.



Other than that, they do not actually share too many similarities, but they are used across numerous industries.



Do you understand utility tokens now? They are slightly different to cryptocurrencies but similar. For a lot of traders, they are more relatable. These digital assets are heading for new forms of interaction within our digital age, whether integrating into the world of games or improving online shopping experiences.

Bitcoin Price Taps $65K As Analyst Who Nailed Pre-Halving All-Time High Says $95,000 Is ‘Quite Obvious’ ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
The price of Bitcoin (BTC) today soared past the $65,000 mark for the first time since May 6. The climb came after U.S. data showed that the monthly pace of inflation was softer than expected in April. This development could spur the Fed’s willingness to begin rate cuts.



Meanwhile, BitQuant, who correctly called the Bitcoin lifetime high before the April halving event, sees Bitcoin hitting $95,000 “in just one move.”



Bitcoin Price Leaps Over $65K



Bitcoin rebounded strongly immediately after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its new Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI report comes after a slew of higher-than-expected inflation readings, dampening traders’ hopes about when rate cuts might commence this year.



The BTC price now hovers at $66,034, CoinGecko data shows. That’s a 7.29% increase over the last 24-hour trading period. And Ether (ETH), the industry’s second-biggest crypto asset by market cap, was changing hands for $3,007.94 — a 3.9% gain compared to yesterday’s. Over the same period, Solana (SOL) jumped 7.6% to around $154.91.



Bitcoin set a new all-time high in March, nearing breaching the $74,000 level. This was a widely celebrated Bitcoin bull rally that some said showed unique strength despite coming before the long-awaited April halving. But the premier crypto soon fluttered downward, a trend attributed to headwinds ranging from depressing U.S. economic metrics to growing political unrest in the Middle East.

&nbsp



Was the halving priced in, or is a new all-time high for this cycle on the horizon? Analyst BitQuant believes a new peak is imminent.



Bitcoin’s Looming Explosive Price Move To $95,000



Bitcoin is gearing up to continue upward and should advance to an eye-popping $95,000. As per BitQuant, such sky-high BTC price heights are a matter of time.



“$95K will be achieved in just one move, and that is quite obvious,” he postulated on X. “Will that move start today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow? I don’t think anyone knows.”



BitQuant was reacting to commentary from fellow crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto, who noted a “cup and handle” formation on Bitcoin’s weekly chart.



The setup comprises a consolidation phase following a run-up, a correction, and an ensuing move higher. In Mikybull Crypto’s view, this results in an astronomical flight to new highs. “The breakout will be explosive and will send it to a cycle top,” he observed in an X post. 



Meanwhile, the nearly a dozen new U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen billions of dollars in inflows so far, which has not only helped re-legitimize crypto given the involvement of trustworthy Wall Street titans such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and JPMorgan but also put considerable buying pressure on Bitcoin.

Will Vanguard's Pro-Crypto CEO Break Its "No Bitcoin" Hold? - DailyCoin


        

Vanguard has maintained an anti-Bitcoin policy.



The appointment of a new CEO gives hope of a reversal in policy.



New CEO Salim Ramji has signaled a pro-Bitcoin stance in the past.




US spot Bitcoin ETFs went live in January, fostering massive hype as crypto products were now available via the stock market. Against the tide of enthusiasm, Vanguard’s former CEO Tim Buckley held firm, stating Bitcoin did not belong in “a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio.” The crypto community warned that the company risked falling behind more open-minded investment firms. 



Buckley’s abrupt retirement in late February fueled speculation that Vanguard’s board was seeking fresh leadership more in tune with the changing times. Those whispers grew louder on Tuesday following the appointment of former BlackRock executive Salim Ramji, who managed BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF application.



Is Vanguard About to Turn?



Vanguard announced on Tuesday that Salim Ramji would be succeeding Buckley as CEO, stirring hope of a U-turn on the company’s Bitcoin policy. Ramji, who previously headed BlackRock’s ETF division and oversaw the launch of its spot Bitcoin ETF, is regarded as a crypto proponent




In his first public remarks since the appointment, Ramji spoke broadly about the “changing investing landscape,” presenting Vanguard with opportunities to serve customers better. “My focus will be to mobilize Vanguard to meet the moment while staying true to that core purpose,” he stated. However, Ramji stopped short of directly addressing the Bitcoin question.



Vanguard had drawn heavy criticism from the crypto community over its refusal to offer Bitcoin products, with some investors even threatening to close retirement accounts over the company’s position. At the time, former Inside Bitcoin host Neil Jacobs blasted the move as a “Terrible business decision by Vanguard.” The pushback highlighted how the investment giant risked alienating a rapidly growing base of crypto-friendly clients.



Commenting on Ramji’s new appointment, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the move was unexpected, given that Vanguard typically promotes CEOs from within the company. On whether Ramji’s appointment would bring an end to Vanguard’s anti-Bitcoin stance, Balchunas stated that he isn’t 100% convinced that would be the case, even despite having publicly praised BTC in the past.



Salim Ramji is a Bitcoin Fan



Following submitting BlackRock’s spot BTC ETF application in June 2023, Ramji publicly praised Bitcoin during a Bloomberg interview. Ramji stated that he was “incredibly excited” about the cryptocurrency’s ability to “remove frictions across the ecosystem,” such as by making custody, trading, and settlement times more efficient.




Ramji also framed BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF as an avenue to give investors access to markets previously obstructed by factors such as difficulty, cost, or lack of transparency. 



During his decade-long tenure at BlackRock, Ramji ended his stint as the head of iShares and index investments, where he oversaw massive growth for the company’s ETF products. 



Ramji’s past pro-Bitcoin rhetoric has stoked optimism that, under his stewardship, Vanguard may finally join the digital asset revolution.



On the Flipside




BlackRock’s spot BTC ETF was the fastest to reach $10 billion AUM in history.



Vanguard’s focus has traditionally been on low-cost, passive index funds rather than “cutting-edge” trends, making its Bitcoin hold-out an unsurprising development.




Why This Matters



The cryptocurrency world will be watching Vanguard’s next moves closely. A reversal of its Bitcoin policy would signal another domino falling on the path to mass adoption. However, whether the company will reverse course on this matter remains unclear.

ETH’s DeFi Scene Eyes Solana | Bankless


Solana solidified its status as a top-tier blockchain after emerging like a phoenix from the ashes of the FTX/Alameda collapse.In the community-led renaissance that followed, it was the sweat of Solana-native teams that greased the wheels of progress, but following a steady build of SOL prices and DeFi metrics, non-native protocols are ready to pounce on the opportunity 👀 🛣️ Solana Natives Pave the WaySOL's epic run off of its December 2022 $8 lows to hitting $210 just two months ago has been one of crypto's most notable comebacks this cycle but the ecosystem's wealth creation hasn't been confined to its native token holders.Developers have been delivering on the hype, starting with the PYTH airdrop in November, which allocated tokens on Solana to addresses that had interacted with Pyth oracles across 27 networks (including Ethereum and its L2s) and marked a turning point that gave users from other ecosystems a direct financial incentive to test out Solana.
Shortly afterward, Solana-native liquid staking protocol Jito Labs conducted its own airdrop, rewarding qualifying wallets that had earned over 100 points with a bare minimum five-figure token allocation for the simple action of holding jitoSOL deposit receipts.The eye-watering distributions received by Jito users transformed Solana into the premier destination for airdrop hunting, catalyzing mass adoption of points-based incentive systems by the chain’s fledgling protocols that have proven highly successful in attracting both users and their capital.🧨 Changing DynamicsWhile it was native protocols that laid the foundation for Solana mainstream crypto acceptance, the ecosystem has increasingly found itself playing host to Ethereum developers.The migration may be taking place at a snail’s pace, but is no doubt occurring as more projects come to realize the massive amounts of onchain activity within Solana and eagerly seek to create a deployment to capitalize on the opportunity.Decentralized compute sharing network Render went all-in on the Solana vision early on, choosing to migrate its token to the SPL standard back in November.Although MetaMask is often considered a laggard when it comes to improving user experience, the Project was among the first Ethereum-native applications to introduce Solana compatibility with the launch of “Snaps” last September, which enabled users to opt into external applications directly from their wallets. To date, the Snaps integration for Solana-native wallet Solflare has onboarded over 500k users!
Numerous money markets exist on Solana, but none come with the same level of time-tested security as Ethereum’s premier blue chip lending destination: Aave.In hopes of leveraging its brand as a competitive advantage on Solana, the Aave DAO approved a January temperature check with 83% consensus to deploy a minimally viable version of its V3 isolated money market through the Neon EVM, a fully compatible Ethereum development environment built on the Solana blockchain.Last Wednesday, a community-generated proposal hit the governance forum of the popular EVM-based perpetuals trading platform GMX, seeking to establish an independent deployment of the exchange to Solana called GMSOL.The GMSOL implementation would exclusively utilize the GMX token for all value measurements and storage while implementing a GMX buyback mechanism and distributing a significant percentage of fees back to the GMX treasury to establish a GMSOL treasury.In exchange for the gift of this new Solana-native deployment, the GMX DAO is expected to cover all costs associated with the Protocol’s audit and grant a license for the replication and usage of its frontend code.
Further, there has been widespread speculation that both Ethena and Pendle, two leading Ethereum projects that have thrived in recent months thanks to an elevated crypto interest rate environment, will be deploying to Solana in the near future.🚀 Long-Term TrajectoryApplications serve users, not blockchains, and although there should be a high bar for many bluechip protocols when considering a new deployment, they would be foolish not to flock to environments where users and activity exist.On networks where a protocol is absent, users will inevitably seek out replacements, putting the market share dominance of existing applications at risk – especially when their chain begins bleeding its market share to competitors.Ethereum and Solana have taken drastically different approaches to scaling, with the former opting for network fragmentation to make operating a validator accessible to all and the latter favoring a unified state that concentrates usage to a single layer. While greater decentralization at the validator level helps in maintaining the Ethereum network’s integrity, it certainly comes with drawbacks that make Solana’s alternative vision of the blockchain highly attractive in certain aspects.At this moment in time, crypto remains very much in the experimentation phase, meaning we truly have no idea what our nascent industry will look like in 10 years, but just as investors can undertake prudent portfolio diversification to mitigate risks, applications can diversify the chains on which they are deployed to safeguard their market share.Developers aiming for maximal success must accept that there is no inevitable hub for the future of finance, and they should deploy their applications accordingly, whether that is Ethereum, Solana, or even the EVM frankenchain Monad or the banker-operated Regulated Settlement Network!The crypto industry must hurdle a massive chasm of uncertainty to progress from infancy into an end-state where true adoption is achieved and trillions upon trillions of dollars in traditional assets make their way onchain. Until then, application developers succumbing to blind chain loyalty are leaving money and market share on the table.

1.9 Billion Dollar Cryptocurrency Operation in China - Bitcoin Sistemi


Police in Sichuan, once known as the center of Bitcoin mining in China, have made significant progress in their investigation of economic crime. Police uncover a massive underground banking case involving more than $1.9 billion.
The suspects allegedly used the stablecoin USDT to smuggle medicines and cosmetics and carry out overseas asset purchases for clients. A total of 193 suspects were arrested in connection with this case.



The operation was carried out with the support of the Anti-Money Laundering Department of the People's Bank of China Sichuan Branch and the Sichuan Branch of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.
Recently, US President Joe Biden ordered a Chinese cryptocurrency mining company and its partners to sell land they own near a US nuclear missile base, citing espionage concerns. The land is less than a mile (1.6 km) from an air force base in Wyoming where intercontinental ballistic missiles are stored.





Currently, all cryptocurrency activities are banned in China and miners had to leave the country years ago.

Vitalik Wants an Ethereum Gas Overhaul: Here's the Catch - DailyCoin


        

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a significant change to the network’s gas model.



The most recent proposal builds on changes made with the introduction of blobs.



Users have questioned whether the proposal will solve network congestion concerns.




Ethereum‘s gas fee model may be set to undergo another overhaul.



On May 9, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin argued that the network’s fee model could be more efficient by adopting a multidimensional gas approach that more accurately reflects the different types of effort required to process transactions. In line with this argument, the developer has submitted a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal, EIP-7706, to introduce a gas category for calldata, which is a feature that allows users to send data or messages with transactions.




In response to the proposal, the biggest question has been whether this gas model overhaul can tackle Ethereum’s network congestion concerns.



What You Need to Know About EIP-7706



As highlighted in Buterin’s May 9 post, Ethereum already operates a multidimensional gas system thanks to the Dencun upgrade, which introduced a separate fee market for blobs containing Layer 2 data. Proposed on Tuesday, May 14, EIP-7706 intends to introduce a third fee market for calldata.



Like the other gas categories, the calldata gas fee market will include a base fee representing the computational effort to process the data and a priority fee to incentivize nodes.



Buterin contended that introducing the third gas fee market would boost network efficiency by allowing developers to significantly decrease the theoretical calldata size per block, potentially leading to marginally faster and cheaper transactions overall. 




“The theoretical max calldata size of a block would be greatly reduced, while basic economic analysis suggests that on average, calldata would become considerably cheaper,” he wrote.



A Salve for Ethereum’s Congestion Concerns?



High gas fees have remained a hurdle for Ethereum’s scalability. Over the years, the network has been known to become unusable during periods of peak demand as everyone’s fees skyrocket.



While Buterin’s most recent proposal aims to optimize these fees, it is not likely to prevent spikes during times of high activity as fees will still be influenced by market forces of demand and supply.



At the time of writing, Ethereum’s comprehensive solution to scaling concerns still lies in its danksharding roadmap—a plan to bolster the network’s throughput by breaking down transaction data and the required computational effort into smaller, more manageable shards. The network took the first step towards danksharding with the introduction of proto-danksharding with the Dencun upgrade in March 2024.



On the Flipside




EIP-7706 is still in the draft phase, meaning it can undergo several changes.



Ethereum fees have plummeted to yearly lows over the past month as activity has shifted to Layer 2 chains following the Dencun upgrade.




Why This Matters



Buterin’s most recent proposal promises to bring greater efficiency to the Ethereum network, which could lead to a noticeably improved user experience with faster and cheaper transactions. Despite these benefits, there is no clear indication that it would solve congestion challenges faced during periods of high activity.

                        The recent two-day outage of the Degen Chain proved to be more than a minor inconvenience. It caused severe disruption as the network failed to produce a block for over 53 hours. This disruption had a cascading effect, rendering the network and its associated applications unusable.According to its block explorer, the network stalled at 8:15 p.m. UTC on May 12, marking the time of the last produced block.Degen Chain Stalled Due to Configuration Error
Degen Chain is among the few layer-3 blockchains that settle transactions on a layer-2 network. It explicitly uses the Ethereum layer-2 chain, Base, for settlement and the AnyTrust protocol for data availability functions.In a May 14 post on X, Degen Chain said it collaborated closely with its development partner, Conduit, a rollup infrastructure platform.Conduit was instrumental in tracing the issue to a “custom config change” that affected both Degen Chain and the gaming network Apex, halting block production.Restoration Efforts and Community Impact
Currently, nodes for the Degen Chain are resynchronizing from the genesis block, the network’s first block, as part of the restoration process. Conduit stated, “We’re working with both teams and Offchain Labs to restore service and minimize impact to users.”Degen Chain projects that the network will resume functionality after the resynchronization process, which is expected to be completed by 1:00 p.m. UTC on May 15 (6:00 a.m. PST on May 15).Downtime for Degen Chain, a layer-3 blockchain initially developed for its native meme coin, Degen (DEGEN), directly affected various decentralized applications hosted by the blockchain.Applications like DegenSwap, Mint Club, and the bridging service Relay Bridge were all inoperable during this period. Consequently, the native DEGEN token experienced a notable decline of 24% from its seven-day high of $0.02 on May 13 to $0.015, according to CoinGecko data.Debate Reignited: The Role of Layer-3 Networks
This incident has rekindled discussions in the crypto community regarding the viability and value of L3 networks. Polygon CEO Marc Boiron has previously argued that these networks “exist only to take value away from Ethereum and onto the [layer-2s] on which the L3s are built.”He criticized Ethereum Layer 3 (L3) networks, arguing they are unnecessary for scaling and divert value from the mainnet.He stated that L3s only transfer value to the Layer 2 (L2) networks they are built on, potentially compromising Ethereum’s security. “I disagree that L2 value is Ethereum value. Just take this to the extreme. If all L3s settled to one L2, Ethereum would capture basically no value and, thus, Ethereum security would be at risk.”Boiron emphasized that Polygon focuses on scaling Ethereum and ensuring fair value distribution between Polygon and Ethereum.On the other hand, proponents of layer-3 solutions, such as Arbitrum Foundation researcher Patrick McCorry, argue that they are beneficial as they use layer-2 networks as settlement layers, making transactions cheaper.Degen Chain experienced a recent increase in activity a few days ago, with nearly $100 million in transaction volume. Since its inception, it has recorded over 272,000 unique transactions and created over 7,500 contracts and 2,300 tokens. However, many of these tokens have been linked to rug pulls and scams.

Arcblock crypto jumps 64% in one month: Is $4.12 next? - AMBCrypto



Arcblock crypto’s price has increased by 64% in the last 30 days.
Bullish pressure is significant in the token’s market.

ABT, the native token of Arcblock crypto, a platform designed to simplify the development of decentralized applications (DApps), is poised to extend its double-digit rally as bullish pressure gains momentum.
At press time, the altcoin exchanged hands at $3.76, witnessing a 20% price rally in the last 24 hours. In the last month, ABT’s price has surged by 64%, according to CoinMarketCap’s data. 
ABT’s path to glory
AMBCrypto’s assessment of ABT’s price movements on a daily chart confirmed the possibility of a sustained price rally in the short to mid-term. 
At press time, the token’s key momentum indicators rested above their respective center lines, suggesting significant buying activity. 
For example, ABT’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 68.97, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) rested in the overbought zone to return 89.75.
At these values, these indicators signaled a preference for ABT accumulation over its distribution by market participants.
Similarly, its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was 0.22. This indicator, which tracks the flow of money into and out of ABT, suggested that the market was flush with the liquidity necessary to sustain the current price rally.
Confirming the current bullish trend, the dots that make up ABT’s Parabolic SAR rested below the coin’s price at press time.
This indicator is used to identify potential trend direction and reversals. When its dotted lines are placed under an asset’s price, it confirms that the market is in an uptrend. 
Traders interpret it as a sign that the asset’s price has been rising and may continue. 
Lending credence to this was ABT’s Elder-Ray Index. It has returned only positive values since 30 April. 
The indicator measures the relationship between the strength of ABT buyers and sellers in the market. When its value is positive, it means that bull power dominates the market.

ABT’s next bus stop
Regarding where ABT’s price might be headed next, if bullish momentum is sustained, the token may rally to exchange hands above $4 at $4.12.

However, if this projection is invalidated and profit-taking activity spikes, the bears might push the token’s price toward $3.4 or trade at $3.1.

Is Ripple Dumping XRP Again? Here’s What We Know | Bitcoinist.com


								Ripple, a cryptocurrency payments company and the largest holder of XRP, has initiated another large-scale transaction that has caught the attention of the crypto market. The payment protocol and exchange network has dumped 150 million XRP, representing approximately 0.25% of the cryptocurrency’s current market capitalization. 
Ripple’s Large-Scale Transfer
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post on Wednesday, May 13, blockchain tracker and analytics system, Whale Alert disclosed that Ripple had sold 150 million XRP tokens valued at over $75.7 million. The recipient of the substantial XRP transfer was an anonymous crypto wallet address identified as “rP4X2hTa7A,” which was activated by Ripple. 

The transfer occurred in two separate transactions, with a one-hour time difference. Whale Alert revealed that 100 million XRP worth approximately $55,776,737 was transferred into ‘rP4X2hTa7A’ from another anonymous wallet address ‘rhWt2bhRq.’
The second transaction saw the rest of the XRP being moved to ‘rP4X2hTa7A,’ recording a 50 million XRP transfer worth about $27.8 million. 
According to data from XRP Ledger (XRPL) explorer, Bithomp, Ripple has consistently maintained a relationship with the wallet address, rP4X2hTa7A. Earlier on April 24, the crypto payments company transferred a whopping 100 million XRP to the above wallet address. After which, portions of the cryptocurrencies were distributed from the wallet to several external addresses.
It’s also worth mentioning that Ripple initiated its 150 million XRP transaction after releasing 1 billion XRP tokens on May 1 from its regular monthly escrow unlock. Following the XRP release, Ripple distributed the cryptocurrency, transferring 200 million XRP to its personal treasury account and allocating the rest of the tokens to new escrows.
XRPScan data also revealed that after receiving the XRP escrow deposit, Ripple’s treasury account identified as ‘Ripple (1)’ had sent the tokens to the aforementioned wallet address, effectively increasing XRP’s supply inflation by introducing new tokens into the market that were previously never in circulation. 
Following the XRP transfer to rP4X2hTa7A, the anonymous wallet address kept 50 million XRP and moved the remaining 100 million XRP to another unknown wallet. If this distribution pattern continues, a sell-off could occur, potentially impacting the price of XRP, which has been consolidating around the $0.5 price mark. 
XRP Price Analysis
Although Ripple’s 150 million XRP dump is not its first transfer this year, a potential sell-off could have a drastic effect on XRP. Historically, XRP’s value tends to experience slight declines after Ripple sells its tokens.

Following this trend, Ripple’s recent XRP transfer has potentially led to a dramatic decline in the price of the cryptocurrency. Just a few days ago XRP’s price was trading around $0.5. However, at the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.49, having declined by 1.37% over the past 24 hours and 4.03% in the previous week, according to CoinMarketCap.

Ethereum Price Prediction as Mysterious Wallet Buys Up 29,000 ETH – Bullish Signal? / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Ethereum (ETH) price is picking up on Wednesday amid a broader rally across crypto and traditional asset markets following US CPI data, with some traders focusing on a mysterious wallet that just scooped up 29,000 ETH, and some are interpreting as a bullish signal.According to various blockchain trackers, a new wallet has accumulated almost 29,000 ETH in the last 24 hours.Traders closely monitor activity amongst crypto whales, because these big market players are often viewed as smart money.That is to say, it is assumed that the sophisticated players moving big funds may have a market edge.Traders will thus be hoping that this most recent accumulation by a mysterious new wallet could be a bottom signal.The Ethereum price had been probing multi-month low support un the $2,800s in recent days.A break below this key support zone could have opened the door to a run lower towards $2,700 and below.But the mysterious new ETH whale maybe have timed the market perfectly.The Ethereum price is up close to 5% and back above $3,000 on Wednesday as traders digest US CPI data.After inflation worried investors after rising in the first quarter of 2024, the latest data has eased fears that the Fed won’t be able to cut interest rates in 2024.If data in the coming weeks continues to point towards renewed disinflation, macro could now be a tailwind.That could suggest that the recent Ethereum price bottom under $3,000 could be a local low.Ethereum Price Prediction – Where is ETH Headed Next
Its too early for the Ethereum bulls to start celebrating.That’s because technical analysis suggests that the bulls are yet to regain control of the market.The Ethereum price remains lodged below its 21DMA near $3,050, as well as its 50 and 100DMAs.It also remains stuck within the confines of a downward trend channel.A convincing push above $3,200 will be needed to send a bullish medium-term price signal.The Ethereum price may have bounced, but will need to clear these resistance levels to re-assert a bullish trend. Source: TradingViewBut Ether’s long-term prospects look strong. Yes, it faces regulatory uncertainty in the USA, with the SEC seemingly pushing to classify it as a security.But its election year, and a new President could mean a new SEC/regulatory approach.Moreover, the Ethereum blockchain is improving. The recent Dencun upgrade appears to have axed gas fees by as much as 4x.High transaction fees were a key factor in diverting network activity to rival chains like Solana.But Ethereum appears to be on the path of re-asserting its spot as the number one web3 chain.As Fed rate cuts, spot ETF demand and post-halving tailwinds vault BTC above $100,000 in 2025, Ether could push on above $5,000.

Research Firm Reveals the Event That Could Have a Bullish Effect on Cryptocurrencies in the Coming Period - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a recent report, digital asset brokerage firm K33 suggested that refunds from bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX could have bullish effects on the crypto market.
The report states, “While the repayments of Mt. Gox and Gemini creditors will have a downward effect on the market, FTX's cash repayment may have an upward effect.”


Unlike Mt Gox and Gemini, which would repay creditors in the form of assets of the same nature, FTX sold assets to pay creditors in cash. K33 believes this could lead to an equilibrium in the market. “On net, buying pressure from cash buyers can neutralize selling pressure from redemptions of the same asset type,” P33 said.
However, K33 also noted that the timing of refunds could still impact the crypto market. While Gemini's $1.7 billion repayment is expected to be made in early June, Mt. Gox's $8.9 billion repayment is expected to be made by October 2024.






The report also said, “If the court approves FTX's restructuring plan, FTX plans to repay creditors within two months. While it remains unclear when or whether the plan will be approved, buyers are preparing for repayments to be made in the late 4th quarter of 2024.”
K33 concluded by stating that the different timing of these repayments could indicate a slow summer in the market and a strong end to the year.

Humanity Protocol Secures $30 Million for Identity Verification


Humanity Protocol, a pioneer in digital identity verification, recently raised $30 million and achieved unicorn status. 
This milestone comes less than a year after the company’s inception. It leverages blockchain technology to authenticate online identities.
Innovative Identity Verification Technology

Humanity Protocol’s solution addresses the challenge of verifying online identities in an era dominated by artificial intelligence and deepfake technology. The company’s utilizes palm scans, which are considered more secure and less invasive than traditional biometric methods. 
By analyzing the unique vein patterns in individuals’ palms, Humanity Protocol ensures high accuracy and security. Indeed, founder Terence Kwok emphasized the increasing importance of robust identity verification systems.

“The whole concept of identity is becoming more important. We look at artificial intelligence. We look at all the deep fake videos that are coming on,” Kwok said.

The recent funding round was led by Kingsway Capital, with additional investments from notable entities such as Animoca Brands, Blockchain.com, and Shima Capital. Earlier this year, the startup also secured $1.5 million from influential figures within the cryptocurrency community.
With the fresh capital, Humanity Protocol plans to expand its 20-person team and forge new partnerships. The company aims to launch its testnet in the second quarter, with a waitlist of approximately 500,000 users. It will initially feature a mobile app capable of scanning palm prints to confirm identities.

In addition to its biometric verification services, Humanity Protocol plans to launch a cryptocurrency token to facilitate the payment of verification fees. The company’s recent funding rounds were conducted through Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs), a common mechanism in the cryptocurrency industry.

Mastercard and Standard Chartered complete first live test of Multi-Token Network - Crypto Briefing




Mastercard and Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong (SCBHK) have successfully completed the first live test of Mastercard’s Multi-Token Network (MTN) within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Fintech Supervisory Sandbox.The proof-of-concept pilot involved tokenizing carbon credits and performing an atomic swap between the tokenized deposit and carbon credit. According to Helena Chen, Mastercard’s managing director for HK & Macau, the project will “reshape how consumers and businesses connect, interact, and transact.”The pilot project was initiated when a client of SCBHK’s virtual bank, Mox Bank, requested to purchase a carbon credit using deposited funds. Mox then requested SCBHK to tokenize the carbon credit through Libeara, a tokenization service provider launched by Standard Chartered’s venture arm, SC Ventures.“The tokenization of real-world assets and the potential use of different forms of tokenized currency is integral to the future of the financial industry,” shares Mary Huen, CEO of Standard Chartered Hong Kong.Mastercard’s MTN facilitated the tokenization of the deposit, enabling the real-time swap across different blockchains. Mastercard launched the MTN on its private blockchain in June last year. Prior to this live test, the network had undergone trial runs in collaboration with the Reserve Bank of Australia using wrapped central bank digital currency (CBDC) and the HKMA using its e-HKD CBDC, although neither of these CBDCs is currently live.The HKMA has been actively promoting Hong Kong as a leading digital assets hub, reportedly pressuring local banks, including SCBHK, to improve their services for crypto exchanges. SCBHK is involved in several HKMA initiatives, such as Project Ensemble, the e-HKD pilot program, and the multinational Project mBridge.In November, HSBC bank and China’s Ant Group also tested tokenized deposit transactions using Ant Group’s blockchain within an HKMA sandbox, while HSBC offers Bitcoin and Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund trading in Hong Kong.

FTX is facing controversy over its proposed repayment plan for creditors.
                        The cryptocurrency exchange FTX went bankrupt in November 2022 after a fraud-fueled collapse, leaving its users unable to access the cryptocurrency they held. FTX announced on May 7 that customers would be repaid their holdings plus interest two years after the initial collapse, but the proposed repayment plan has sparked a backlash among creditors.FTX’s plan involves raising between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion from selling off assets to repay creditors. Under this plan, creditors will receive $11.2 billion, resulting in a payout of up to 118% of the value of their FTX accounts as of November 2022, to compensate for the time value of their investments.The funds to repay users will come from monetizing a collection of assets, including cryptocurrency held by the platform, proprietary investments held by Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, and litigation claims. These assets include FTX’s 8% stake in AI startup Anthropic, which was sold to institutional investors for $884 million in March.Creditors Furious Despite FTX Repayment Plan
FTX expects to collect enough cash to pay users 100% of what they’re owed, plus interest, but there’s a catch: they’re not getting their crypto back. Instead, they’ll receive US dollars based on the value of their accounts at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy in November 2022.The cryptocurrency market experienced a crash in the immediate aftermath of the FTX bankruptcy, leaving it crippled. However, the market has since staged a substantial surge, with Bitcoin more than tripling in value from $17,000 to over $64,000.This means that creditors will not benefit from Bitcoin’s higher prices, instead receiving a 9% interest rate. The backlash stems from the perception that this interest rate does not adequately compensate for the true value of the assets lost.A Bloomberg report highlighted the plight of Arush Sehgal and Acaena Amoros Romero, whose life savings were tied up in FTX, standing to recoup only about $1 million, a quarter of what their account would be worth today.Sehgal, a former member of the FTX creditor committee, has been critical of the restructuring advisors’ handling of the case. “A hundred cents on the dollar doesn’t really mean much to me,” he said, underscoring the frustration among creditors.When Will Repayments Be Issued?
While FTX has indicated that repayments could be issued later this year, resistance from creditors may impede the process.Over 80 creditors have filed letters with the bankruptcy court, criticizing decisions made by FTX CEO John Ray, particularly the methodology used to determine account values.Sehgal estimates that over 1,500 creditors share his views, as evidenced by the response on FTX.vote, a platform he created to mobilize opposition to the plan.In January, a group of creditors sued FTX in bankruptcy court, arguing that their crypto was not a property that FTX could sell.The judge overseeing the FTX Chapter 11 case will likely need to resolve this lawsuit before any payouts can be made to customers. The outcome of this legal battle will determine the fate of the FTX repayment plan and the financial recovery for its former customers.The plan’s success in satisfying creditors ultimately hinges on resolving this legal dispute and the overall direction of the cryptocurrency industry.

Subsquid to Launch SQD Token for Enhanced Blockchain Indexing


Subsquid is gearing up to launch its native token, SQD, on May 17, responding to the growing demand for crypto indexing services. 
The token aims to enhance the functionality and reach of Subsquid’s decentralized indexing solutions across various blockchains.
SQD’s Role in Improving Blockchain Accessibility

Starting with Polkadot, Subsquid expanded to Ethereum and recently introduced a Solana beta. Venture capitalists have invested over $17 million in the project, and several cryptocurrency exchanges could soon list the SQD token.
It will be deployed on the Ethereum mainnet and then bridged to Arbitrum One. SQD aims to keep the blockchain reliable and impartial, strengthening Subsquid’s network by empowering node operators to organize on-chain data efficiently. This allows developers to effectively monitor and interact with blockchain ecosystems, enhancing data access. 
The token’s utility includes curating network participants via a delegation system to select trustworthy operators. By locking SQD tokens, users can access better data rates from the decentralized data lake, ensuring fair resource consumption.

“It’s vital to encourage community engagement and enhance our indexing capabilities,” Marcel Fohrmann, co-founder of Subsquid, said.

Subsquid has focused on making blockchain data more coherent and accessible. It also offers customizable frontends, allowing developers to tailor data presentations to their specific needs.

 “Our platform provides a solid foundation that lets developers focus on innovation while we handle data management challenges,” mitry Zhelezov, CEO of Subsquid, explained.

Therefore, the introduction of the SQD token aims to significantly simplify how developers integrate blockchain technology into their projects.

First US Presidential debate planned for June 27 - Will crypto be on the agenda?

Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the presumptive candidates for U.S. President in 2024, will face off against each other for the first time in four years in a June debate.In a May 15 X post, President Biden said he had received and accepted an invitation from CNN for a presidential debate on June 27, challenging Trump to respond. The former U.S. President reportedly accepted the date for the event in a statement to Fox News, saying he was “ready and willing” to debate President Biden in an earlier post to his social media platform Truth Social. Trump has been required to appear in a New York courtroom as a defendant in a criminal trial involving hush money payments to an adult film star and falsification of business related to the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, but the presiding judge attends to other matters on Wednesdays. It’s unclear whether his other pending criminal cases in the District of Columbia, Florida and Georgia could conflict with the June debate.If confirmed, the debate would be held before either Trump or President Biden officially accepted their party’s nomination for U.S. President. The Democratic National Convention and Republican National Convention are expected to occur in August and July, respectively. Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., trailing President Biden and Trump in the polls, claimed he was “excluded” from the debate. During their runs to become the Republican Party nominee for president, candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis often discussed crypto-related issues and central bank digital currencies. As recently as May 8, during a dinner for supporters who purchased his nonfungible tokens, Trump said he was “good with” crypto in the United States. However, the former president has previously referred to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as a scam.Related: Neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump are crypto championsMany lawmakers and industry leaders seemingly supportive of President Biden have called on him to consider how crypto-focused people will vote in 2024. Some have pointed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing several enforcement actions against crypto firms under the Biden administration and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren attacking digital assets through legislation and public statements. Source: Tyler WinklevossThough President Biden rarely speaks on digital assets personally, he has used his position to oppose legislation and policies that many in the space reject. On May 8, as the House of Representatives was considering passing a joint resolution that would overturn an SEC policy on banks holding crypto, President Biden said he would veto the measure. The resolution passed the House with support from 21 Democratic lawmakers and is headed to the Senate.The last time President Biden and Trump faced off in person was in September 2020 for the first U.S. Presidential debate at Case Western Reserve University. Trump’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, later claimed in his book that the former president had been diagnosed with COVID-19 days before the debate but hid the results. Neither then-candidate Biden nor Trump discussed cryptocurrency or blockchain during the two debates. At the time of publication, President Biden’s campaign website did not have an ‘issues’ page for his policy positions, while Trump’s website included his stance on the economy. Neither website specifically mentioned digital assets.“Many crypto owners are single issue voters and we risk losing them in this presidential election,” said Democratic Representative Wiley Nickel in a May 11 X post. With neither major U.S. Presidential candidate having precise positions on crypto at any given moment, it’s unclear whether the technology will be a subject during the June 27 debate or the second one scheduled on Sept. 10.

Shiba Inu Burn Rate Explodes Over 4000%, Igniting Optimism for $0.001 SHIB Price Target ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Shiba Inu, a well-known meme coin in the cryptocurrency world, has once again caught the attention of investors. The coin experienced a remarkable 4000% increase in its burn rate in May, fueling optimism about its future path to a $0.001 SHIB Price.



Despite facing a downward trend in its price over the past month, SHIB has shown resilience against bearish market conditions. The coin has undergone several upgrades, enhancing its cryptographic capabilities and positioning it for future growth.



In light of the recent surge in its burn rate and positive market trends, Shiba Inu is currently mainly trading in the green, reflecting growing confidence among investors.



Data from the Shiba Inu burn tracker, Shibburn, reveals a remarkable increase in the burn rate, reaching 4,085.94% over the past 24 hours. This surge in burning activity has resulted in the incineration of over 182,349,898 SHIB tokens, marking a significant milestone in SHIB’s deflationary journey.



SHIB Token Burn Impact



Every SHIB token sent to the burn address reduces the overall supply in circulation, a key objective of the burn mechanism. With the latest burn, the total number of SHIB tokens taken out of circulation has reached 410,726,404,777,297, leaving approximately 589,273,595,222,702 SHIB tokens still in circulation.

&nbsp



Shiba Inu’s lackluster market performance is mainly due to its high market supply. However, as recent developments highlight, the Shiba Inu community’s token burn mechanism aims to reduce this supply.



This development has sparked optimism regarding Shiba Inu’s future price movements. By reducing the supply of SHIB tokens, the burn mechanism could eventually increase demand and, consequently, the token’s price, following the basic economic principle of supply and demand.



With the increased burn rate, SHIB has shown positive trading activity, which is further supported by recent developments in the project.



As the Shiba Inu project progresses towards its long-term goals, the core team, under Shytoshi Kusama’s leadership, is gearing up to introduce innovative utilities aimed at boosting demand for the token. Among these initiatives is the upcoming Shibarium hard fork, which promises to enhance protocol versatility and drive adoption within the ecosystem.



SHIB Price and Market Outlook



The price of SHIB has increased slightly by 3.17% over the past 24 hours, reaching $0.00002413. The surge in burning activity and the community’s optimism could pave the way for the coveted $0.001 price appreciation as SHIB continues its deflationary trajectory.

Bitcoin Dominance Suppresses Altcoin Gains: Will AI Ignite a Rally?


																AI and big data crypto projects and tokens are suffering losses, reflecting a market lacking a clear direction. As a result, the broader altcoin sector is in turmoil as traders eagerly await signals from Bitcoin.
A new analysis suggests that the dominance of the world’s largest cryptocurrency is increasing, which is holding back altcoin profits. A decrease in its dominance may come as a huge relief for the alts.
Altcoin Rally Ahead?
Glassnode founders ‘Negentropic’ observed that Bitcoin’s dominance in the market is currently rising, which has been suppressing the gains of altcoins.
However, a potential decline in Bitcoin’s dominance could trigger significant rallies among altcoins. Notably, POWR, FTT, and NMR have emerged as top performers among the lot. Bitcoin’s recent surge from a horizontal support level has further boosted momentum in the market.
“Will AI super-boost AI Altcoins? BTC dominance is on the rise, suppressing altcoin gains. A decline in BTC dominance could ignite significant altcoin rallies.”
Looking ahead, AI altcoins are expected to be in the spotlight over the coming month, driven by key events such as NVIDIA’s earnings report on May 22, Apple’s WWDC on June 10, the potential launch of ChatGPT 5, the emergence of a GPT-based search engine, and Google’s I/O event, which just took place.




These catalysts could significantly influence market sentiment and drive interest and investment in AI-focused cryptocurrencies.
At its annual I/O developer conference earlier this week, Google released Project Astra, which is capable of providing real-time responses to user queries using text, audio, or video inputs. With this, the tech giant’s move aims to solidify its dominance over the recent surge in generative AI technologies.
Despite Google’s new introduction, AI tokens have failed to rally. Data compiled by CoinGecko shows major AI tokens’ lackluster performance throughout the week, with only a handful of them in the green.
VC Investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Web3 and Artificial Intelligence (AI) became leading investment areas in blockchain startups in 2023, securing over 11% of total VC funding in the sector.
This is evident in Stan Miroshnik’s report at TenSquared (10SQ), which revealed that VC investments in Web3 and AI startups exceeded $637 million last year.

Market Expert Who Predicted Bitcoin’s Rise above $69,000 Unveils New Target


																The Bitcoin rise above $69,000 before the fourth halving to reach a new all-time high of $73,000 in 2024 took many by surprise. However, crypto analyst BitQuant was not one of those people. In 2023, the analyst had correctly predicted that the BTC price would reach a new all-time high before the halving was completed. After the successful completion of his prediction, the crypto analyst has once again predicted where the Bitcoin price is headed, and how high it will go.
Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $95,000
BitQuant has unveiled his latest prediction for the Bitcoin price, and the target being displayed will please many who continue to be bullish. Amid the choppy headwinds that have dominated the market, the analyst believes that the Bitcoin price will surge and reach $95,000.

	Related Reading



Interestingly, the analyst does not expect the campaign to $95,000 to be a long, drawn-out move. Rather, BitQuant explains that the Bitcoin price can complete this target in a single move. Such a move would mean a 50% increase in price from its current level of around $62,000 and will no doubt trigger a ripple effect that will be evident in the market.
The post read:

$95K will be achieved in just one move, and that is quite obvious. Will that move start today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow? I don’t think anyone knows. If you can’t relax now and wait for #Bitcoin to perform as expected, then it’s better to leave the market to avoid the torture. Because in the coming months, there will be a lot of pain for those with weak nerves.

BitQuant’s prediction was in response to another crypto analyst, Mikybull, who identified the formation of a ‘cup and handle’ pattern on the Bitcoin crash. The analyst believes that this formation will precede a massive breakout that will send it to a “cycle top.”

Is $250,000 Still In Play?
Back in 2023, when BitQuant made the initial prediction that Bitcoin would reach a new all-time high before the halving, he had set out a price target for the cryptocurrency. As the crypto analyst explained at the time, reaching a new all-time high before the halving, although it has never happened before, does not mean that it will peak by then.

	Related Reading



Rather, the analyst expects the bull rally to continue well after the halving, which is when the price will peak. BitQuant’s target at the time was the price peaking at $250,000 at the top of the cycle. However, this target has not made an appearance in his analyses in recent times.
The most recent predictions circle around the $95,000 target and the analyst expects it to hit this price in May. In a prediction from April, BitQuant expects that the price will first go to $49,000, before recovering to $75,000, and then surge to $95,000.

In a startling development in Hong Kong's crypto sector, a scam involving "hell banknotes" has led to the arrest of three employees from a crypto exchange shop located in Tsim Sha Tsui.


								In a startling development in Hong Kong’s crypto sector, a scam involving “hell banknotes” has led to the arrest of three employees from a crypto exchange shop in Tsim Sha Tsui.
The suspects allegedly deceived a customer into transferring HK$1 million (approximately $127,500) worth of Tether (USDT) in exchange for counterfeit currency traditionally used in Chinese rituals. This incident marks a concerning trend in misusing digital currencies for fraudulent schemes.

Crypto Scam: The Arrest And Police Investigation
The scam was exposed when a 35-year-old man reported to the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) that he could not receive any real currency after attempting to convert his cryptocurrency at the shop.
He was shown stacks of what appeared to be cash but were actually ‘hell banknotes’—paper money intended as offerings to the deceased, not legal tender. The revelation of this deception prompted immediate police action.
The HKPF’s technology crime division moved quickly to detain the three men, aged 31 to 34, involved in the scam operation.
During the probe, police confiscated 3,000 hell banknotes, a safe, and a note-counting machine, indicating the deliberate nature of the scam. The suspects had convinced the victim to transfer his USDT to their wallet, only to provide worthless paper in return and then flee the scene.
Notably, this fraudulent act could lead to severe legal consequences for the perpetrators. Hong Kong law stipulates up to 14 years in prison for fraud. The suspects are also potentially liable for acquiring property by deception, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years.
Preventive Measures And Broader Implications
In response to this and similar incidents, the HKPF has issued an advisory urging the public to use only ‘licensed and authorized cryptocurrency exchanges.”
According to the report, they emphasized the importance of “inspecting banknotes” and being “vigilant about the authenticity” of currency received in transactions.
Furthermore, this incident is part of the region’s larger pattern of crypto-related scams. Last month, Hong Kong customs officials arrested three individuals linked to a HK$1.8 billion ($228 million) money-laundering operation using a crypto platform and bank accounts associated with shell companies.
These operations highlight criminals’ sophisticated methods to exploit the digital finance ecosystem.
Florence Yeung Yee-tak, commander of the Financial Investigation Division of the Customs Department, noted the difficulties in investigating these crimes due to cryptocurrencies’ inherent “anonymity” and the lack of “jurisdictional boundaries.”

According to Yeung Tak, the department relies heavily on intelligence, capital flow analysis, and comprehensive financial investigations to combat these kinds of illegal crypto activities.

What Does It Mean for Companies to Buy Billions of Dollars of Bitcoin Recently? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Matt Hougan, CIO of spot Bitcoin ETF issuer Bitwise, says the Bitcoin ETF allocations included in recent 13F filings are just the beginning. Institutional investors' recently disclosed Bitcoin allocations from first-quarter 13F filings were merely a “down payment,” according to the CIO.
Hougan explains that it takes most professional investors between six and twelve months to evaluate cryptocurrency investments. This process typically follows a pattern of due diligence, personal allocation, individual customer allocations and finally platform-wide allocation.


“About six months after the initial distribution, many firms begin to distribute across their entire client books, with allocations ranging from 1-5% of the portfolio,” Hougan wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.
Highlighting the potential of Bitcoin ETFs, Bitwise CIO said, “The great promise of Bitcoin ETFs is that they can open the door for professional investors to purchase BTC en masse, significantly increasing the pool of capital invested in the asset.”





13F filings are quarterly reports filed with the SEC by institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in stock assets under management. These filings provide a snapshot of a manager's stock holdings at the end of each quarter.

Hougan highlighted several firms with significant Bitcoin ETF holdings. The firm Hightower Advisors, the second largest registered investment advisor, owns $68 million worth of spot bitcoin ETFs. Other notable firms include Cambridge Investment Research, Sequoia Financial Advisors, Integrated Advisors and Brown Advisory, with shares worth $40 million, $12 million, $11 million and $4 million, respectively.


A total of 563 professional investment firms reported holding $3.5 billion worth of bitcoin ETFs as of last Thursday. Hougan predicts we could see over 700 professional firms reporting total assets under management approaching $5 billion by the May 15 (today) filing deadline. The ownership scale for the new ETFs is “unorthodox,” according to Hougan.
While individual investors still dominate the ETF market, professional investors account for only 7-10% of ETFs' $50 billion in assets under management so far. However, Hougan argues that this rate will increase significantly given the adoption pattern by institutional investors.





For example, Hightower Advisors' current spot Bitcoin ETF holding amounts to just 0.05% of its assets, according to the CIO. If they follow the typical behavioral pattern Hougan outlines, a 1% allocation over time will equal $1.2 billion from a single firm.

5thScape is a first-of-its-kind crypto-infused VR/AR ecosystem that will be powered by the versatile 5SCAPE token.Huge demand for 5SCAPE in the project’s presale suggests investors are betting heavily that 5thScape will be a market leader.The new VR ICO has already raised close to a whopping $6 million.At the current price of $0.00327, investors are buying into this exciting project at a market cap of under $20 million.They will also be sat on paper gains of over 200% when the token launches at a planned $0.1.If 5thScape starts to gain traction as a market leader, it could easily become a $200+ million market cap coin.That could mean gains of over 10x for presale investors.$5SCAPE token can be bought today with ETH, MATIC, USDT, BNB, or card.80% of the total 5.1 billion token supply is available for purchase in the presale.Buy 5SCAPE Here

The S&P 500 Index (SPX) and the Nasdaq Composite soared to a new lifetime high after the United States Consumer inflation report came in less than expected. That ignited a rally in Bitcoin (BTC), pushing the price above $66,000. The farther Bitcoin moves from $60,000, the less likely a breakdown is. However, that does not guarantee the start of a new uptrend. Galaxy Digital founder and CEO Mike Novogratz said during the firm’s first quarter earnings call that Bitcoin was likely to consolidate between $55,000 and $75,000 before moving higher at the end of the current quarter.The failure of the bears to sink Bitcoin below $60,000 seems to have attracted buyers.

The TON/USDT pair could rally to $9.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down from the current level and plummets below the moving averages.Dogecoin price analysisThe bulls are trying to prevent Dogecoin (DOGE) from slipping below the neckline and completing a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern.DOGE/USDT daily chart.

If the price rises above the 20-day EMA, the DOGE/USDT pair could reach the 50-day SMA ($0.17). This is an essentialt level for the bears to defend because a break above it could clear the path for a rally to $0.21.The bears will seize control if they sink and sustain the price below the neckline of the H&S pattern. That could start a drop to $0.08.Related: Why is Bitcoin price up today?Cardano price analysisThe failure of the bears to maintain Cardano (ADA) below the support line on May 15 attracted solid buying by the bulls.ADA/USDT daily chart.

If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and sustains below the support line, it will signal the start of the next leg of the downtrend. The ADA/USDT pair could descend to $0.35.Instead, if the price continues higher and jumps above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bears are losing their grip. The pair may climb to the 50-day SMA ($0.51) and later to $0.57.Avalanche price analysisAvalanche (AVAX) has been trading below the 20-day EMA ($35) for the past few days, but the bears have failed to pull the price to the support of the range at $29. This suggests that selling dries up at lower levels.AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bulls will try to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, it will suggest that the AVAX/USDT pair could remain range-bound between $40 and $29 for a few more days. A break above $40 could start a rally to $50.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the bears are trying to take charge. The pair may then slump to the strong support at $29. If this level breaks down, it will indicate the start of the next leg of the downtrend. The pair may then decline to the next support at $25.Shiba Inu price analysisThe bulls successfully guarded the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern in Shiba Inu (SHIB) on May 13.SHIB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe flattening 20-day EMA ($0.000023) and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty, hence it is better to wait for the price to rise above or fall below the triangle before placing large bets.If the price breaks above the triangle, it will suggest that the corrective phase may be over. The SHIB/USDT pair could rise to $0.000030 and then to $0.000033. On the contrary, a break below the triangle could open the doors for a fall to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.000017.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

El Salvador has launched tokenized investment offerings on the Liquid network, enabling individuals to invest in projects like a new hotel at El Salvador International Airport.
                        El Salvador took a decisive step into tokenization on Tuesday, unveiling national investment opportunities based on Bitcoin infrastructure.El Salvador Bitcoin: Investing in Development
The nation’s National Bitcoin Office launched its blockchain-based capital raise on the Liquid network.Liquid is a Bitcoin sidechain managed by Blockstream and a federation of 65 Bitcoin-centric companies globally. Utilizing BTC as its native asset, the blockchain facilitates faster, cheaper, and more private transactions than the main Bitcoin blockchain.Beyond BTC, Liquid allows for the issuance of tokens representing diverse assets, including stablecoins like Tether (USDT), meme coins, and real-world assets and securities.One of El Salvador’s token offerings involves investing in constructing the first hotel at El Salvador International Airport. The investment would yield 10% annually over a five-year term, requiring a minimum investment of $1000.“The infrastructure will include 80 rooms, five commercial spaces each measuring 99 square meters, a swimming pool, and various amenities such as restaurants, a gym, gardens, multipurpose rooms, among others,” the offering states on the Inverlag Hotels website.Tokenized Offerings on the Liquid Network
Investors would also secure free nights at the hotel they are helping build. Anyone who invests $1 million gets an all-year-round free stay throughout the bond’s five-year lifespan.“These opportunities are typically unavailable to the general public,” explained Roberto Laguardia, CEO of Inverlag, in an interview. “They are usually reserved for large-scale or institutional investors and private equity firms… However, with a minimum investment of $1000, individuals can access a 10% interest rate, paid bi-annually, over a five-year period.”The tokenized issuance was conducted by El Salvador Bitcoin startup DitoBanx, while the exchange platform used to issue the tokens is Bitfinex. Due to regulations, the investment is not available to U.S. investors.Advantages of Tokenized Investments
El Salvador is the first and only country in the world to treat El Salvador Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. The state regularly invests in BTC and runs a Bitcoin mining operation powered by geothermal energy from the region’s local volcanoes.El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin extends beyond its legal tender status, as these new tokenized investment offerings demonstrate. The Bitcoin Office said this week that the nation has mined 474 BTC since 2021 and now holds 5,750 BTC ($378 million) in total.

KuCoin Latest To Pull Naira P2P in Nigerian War on Exchanges - DailyCoin


        

KuCoin has joined Binance and OKX to pull p2p support in Nigeria.



The KuCoin decision comes as authorities have embarked on a crypto exchange crackdown.



The country’s central bank has also moved to restrict crypto transactions.




“Which exchange is next?”



That’s the question Nigerian crypto market participants have been asking in recent weeks as the government has cast its eye on crypto p2p trading to catch the falling dagger, which is the country’s local currency. According to authorities, bad actors have thwarted monetary policy efforts to stabilize the naira by manipulating its value through alleged pump-and-dump schemes on these crypto p2p platforms.




This belief led to a crackdown on crypto exchanges, which forced Binance and OKX to withdraw support for the naira on their p2p platform. With the Nigerian SEC announcing plans to follow up the recent crackdown with an official crypto p2p ban, KuCoin has followed suit.



A “Temporary Pause?”



On Wednesday, May 15, many Nigerian KuCoin users were met with a shocking realization: they could no longer find the naira on the exchange’s p2p platform.



In an announcement on the same day, KuCoin confirmed it had pulled naira support on its p2p platform, describing the move as a “temporary pause” to ensure compliance.



Without going into details, the firm asserted that it was committed to resolving the situation quickly so it could resume naira p2p services.



A screengrab of KuCoin’s message to Nigerians



The KuCoin decision is the latest salvo in a sequence of events that have marked the rollback of progress made in December 2023, when the country’s central bank removed a two-year embargo on banks that prevented them from facilitating crypto transactions.



Walls Close in on Nigerian Crypto Traders



In the past two weeks, the country’s central bank has instructed financial institutions to freeze and report transactions involving cryptocurrencies.



At the same time, in the past three weeks, Nigeria’s anti-graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, has obtained permission to freeze over 1,000 accounts belonging to crypto traders pending investigations that could lead to prosecutions for money laundering and terrorism financing.



On the Flipside 




In a recent blog post, Binance CEO Richard Teng asserted that efforts to seek practical guidance from the Nigerian SEC on licensing procedures in the past year had been met with no response.



Despite the ongoing crypto crackdown, the naira has depreciated in recent weeks, trading around 1,520 naira per dollar.




Why This Matters



KuCoin’s move to cease naira support on its p2p platform is the latest sign of escalation in Nigeria’s crypto crackdown. With the looming ban, crypto p2p transactions will likely move to encrypted messaging platforms where users will likely face greater risk of scams and exploitative rates.

Bitcoin Mining Stock Bit Digital Jumps On Q1 Earnings: What You Need To Know - Bit Digital (NASDAQ:BTBT) - Benzinga

Shares of Bitcoin BTC/USD miner Bit Digital Inc BTBT are moving higher in Wednesday’s after-hours session after the company reported better-than-expected financial results for the first quarter.What Happened: Bit Digital said first-quarter revenue increased 266% year-over-year to $30 million, which beat the consensus estimate of $27.733 million, according to Benzinga Pro. The company noted that its strong revenue growth was driven by the commencement of its Bit Digital AI business, as well as by higher realized Bitcoin prices.The company reported quarterly earnings of 43 cents per share, which beat analyst estimates of 1 cent per share. Bitcoin mining revenue was up 166% on a year-over-year basis. Bit Digital’s AI business began generating revenue in January, and recognized $8.1 million of revenue during the quarter. The company said it mined 410.7 Bitcoin during the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Bit Digital also noted it earned 111.1 Ethereum ETH/USD in native staking and 1.3 ETH in liquid staking in the first quarter. As of March 31, Bit Digital held 956.4 Bitcoin and 16,031.411 Ethereum.The company’s active hash rate of its Bitcoin mining fleet was approximately 2.76 EH/s as of March 31. Bit Digital noted that it purchased approximately 2,350 Bitcoin mining units during the first quarter.“We were well prepared for the halving which occurred in April 2024. Our balance sheet remains a core strength with over $160 million of total liquidity as of March 31, 2024, zero debt, and a growing revenue stream that is not correlated to the economics of Bitcoin mining,” the company said.“While we continue to evaluate the post-halving bitcoin mining landscape, our goal of reaching 6.0 EH/s this year remains intact. We are actively engaged in discussions for both incremental hosting opportunities and potential acquisitions.”Management will hold a conference call to discuss these results Thursday at 10 a.m. ET.Check This Out: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Spike On Good Macro News: ‘So Far, So Good,’ Says Bullish TraderBTBT Price Action: Bit Digital shares were up 5.06% after hours at $2.49 at the time of publication, according to Benzinga Pro.Photo: Shutterstock.

Bitcoin rallies to $66,000 as inflation pressure eases - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to $66,400 on Wednesday after the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed signs of easing inflation pressures, according to data from CoinGecko.The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a decrease in the CPI to 3.4% year-over-year in April, down from 3.5% in March. Similarly, the core CPI, which omits food and energy prices, fell to 3.6% from the previous 3.8%. Both CPI figures matched market forecasts, with monthly increases of 0.3%.The reading provided some relief after earlier CPI reports suggested more persistent inflation, which dampened expectations for an early Federal Reserve interest rate cut.With inflation seemingly reversing course, investors are now pricing in a 75% probability of a rate cut in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.Bitcoin surged past $63,000 briefly after inflation data was released. The flagship crypto has extended its rally over the past hours. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $65,900, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko’s data.The overall crypto market cap also experienced growth, rising almost 6% to approximately $2.5 trillion. Major altcoins followed suit, with Ethereum (ETH) crossing the $3,000 threshold, up 4%, and Solana (SOL) breaking the $150 level with an 8% gain.Bitcoin may have hit the bottomBitcoin (BTC) may have exited the post-halving “danger zone” – the three-week period following the Bitcoin halving event, said technical analyst Rekt Capital in his recent post. He suggests that Bitcoin has transitioned to the accumulation phase.If historical patterns hold, the next bull market peak could occur between mid-September and mid-October 2025, he noted.“Currently, Bitcoin is accelerating in this cycle by approximately 200 days now,” the analyst stated. “So the longer Bitcoin consolidates after the Halving, the better it will be for resynchronising this current cycle with the traditional Halving cycle.”

Ethereum Layer-2 Network Blast Reveals Airdrop Details - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBlast, a rising Ethereum layer-2 scaling network from the founder of NFT marketplace Blur, has finally announced a launch date for its upcoming BLAST token airdrop: June 26. That’s later than expected.“We know this is past our initial estimate of May and we’re sorry for the delay,” the official network account wrote on Twitter. “The airdrop allocation will be increased to account for this.”According to Blast, the network will hold two more distributions of Blast Gold points before the token launch. Blast Gold works like airdrop points but for creators of decentralized apps (dapps) building on the network. Many dapps have then distributed their awarded gold to users—including Fantasy Top, the viral NFT game based around Crypto Twitter influencers.Half of the token airdrop will be allotted to developers through Blast Gold. The other half will be distributed to early users, including those who bridged funds to the network before the Blast mainnet went live at the end of February. Users had bridged over $2.3 billion worth of crypto in the hopes of earning points toward the upcoming airdrop.And there's a good reason they’re interested, beyond the typical crypto trader search for yield: Blast is aggressively built around user incentives, much like Blur before it, and that has worked out well for both Blur and its users. The NFT marketplace handed out some $818 million worth of tokens to traders in 2023, catapulting Blur above the competition and making it the second most valuable airdrop of last year.Blast has seen rising momentum around some of its early apps, games, and tokens, including the aforementioned Fantasy Top, which has dominated the Crypto Twitter conversation in recent weeks while driving an increase in NFT trading volume. Pacmoon, a meme coin propelled by viral content creation incentives, has also continued to gain, setting a new all-time high price last week.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

It’s time to overturn SAB 121 - Blockworks


Gary Gensler’s Securities and Exchange Commission has made a name for itself with its hostility towards cryptocurrency. Time after time, over the last few years, his agency has repeatedly thrown up roadblocks to the common-sense regulation of digital assets and overstepped its regulatory authority.
One of the SEC’s most detrimental actions on digital assets came in the form of a seemingly innocuous memo known as Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (or SAB 121). SAB 121 is significant because it requires publicly traded banks to place digital assets on their balance sheet. This change contradicts a basic rule of bank custody: that bank custodial assets are always held off-balance sheet. 
As a result, banks are staying on the sidelines. These highly regulated institutions have successfully offered custodial services to the traditional financial system for decades. They are the experts in their field, and keeping them out of this market is making Americans less safe.
The recent approval of the bitcoin ETPs revealed a problem: The bitcoin within these ETPs is not held by banks, and most have the same custodian. 
If Chair Gensler wishes to protect retail investors, he should take this problem seriously. Whether you love crypto or hate crypto, digital assets are here to stay. We need to ensure American investors receive the same protections they would with any other asset class.
The content of the Bulletin is a problem, but the process is arguably even worse. First, Gensler’s SEC issued this bulletin without conferring with the banking regulators — an obvious misstep. Then, they attempted to circumvent the customary regulatory process by issuing a bulletin rather than a rule. Their process foul was so egregious that even the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office threw a flag on it, declaring that SAB 121 is effectively a rule for the purposes of the Congressional Review Act.
Last week, the US House of Representatives had the chance to change the course of federal policy and restore the role of Congress in the administrative rulemaking process. With the support of 207 Republicans and 21 Democrats, the House advanced our bipartisan resolution, H.J. Res. 109, which repeals SAB 121 under the CRA.
Now, the Senate is slated to take up H.J. Res. 109. We’re hopeful that this bipartisan, bicameral resolution will send a message — It’s time to adjust the SEC’s misguided approach to digital assets. 
We need a repeal of SAB 121 for the future of our digital economy, the safe custody of cryptocurrencies and the good of the American investor.

How High Can The XRP Price Go? Crypto Analyst Unveils 6-Month Prediction


																Crypto analysts continue to be super bullish on the future of the XRP price despite its poor performance in the past. However, while some analysts have predicted price targets that, to many, seem unrealistic, others have set more conservative targets. This is the case of crypto analyst Alan Santana, who just unveiled his 6-month prediction for the XRP price.
XRP Price Is Ready For A Bullish Wave
Alan Santana took to the TradingView website to share his latest analysis on the XRP price. This prediction is expected to play out over the next six months as the crypto market heads into what is expected to be an explosive bull rally.

The crypto analyst believes that in this cycle, the altcoin may find its price moving well ahead of other altcoins. “it is likely to be one of the first to move… One of the first to move big!” the analyst said. Santana also gives reasons for this, one of them being that the waiting period between each bullish wave for the XRP price has elapsed.
His analysis showed that the altcoin has usually seen a 6-8-month gap between each bullish wave. However, it had been 308 days since it saw its last bullish wave, which is well over 10 months. This means that the altcoin is more than ready for another bullish wave. He also added, “The fact that XRPUSDT went through a correction and has been consolidating for this long is considered bullish.”

Furthermore, the altcoin has been on a bullish trend, recording higher lows. This is usually bullish for any asset as it suggests better support for the price as it moves upward. “Higher lows means that the bulls have the upper hand when it comes to the long-term trajectory of this chart,” Santana explained.
XRP Can Move 280% In 2024-2025
The crypto analyst expects a rather rapid bullish wave for the XRP price and stated that he expects this to happen sometime in 2024 and 2025. The main reason behind this is that the accumulation phase for the altcoin is finally coming to an end.
This is a sentiment that has also been shared by another crypto analyst known as U-Copy. According to the analyst, the XRP price had been in accumulation for the last seven years, but it has finally come to an end in 2024, and this end in the accumulation phase will lead to a rally.

While U-Copy expects the altcoin to hit a new all-time high price as this accumulation phase comes to an end, which would be an at least 600% move from here, Santana has taken a more conservative stance. The analyst does expect the XRP price to break above $1, but puts the peak around $1.9 and $2. This would mean a 280-300% move from here.
“Once it starts going, it will go really strong and for a very long while… People will be wondering, ‘why didn’t I buy when prices were low?’,” the analyst concluded.

How Did This Crypto Investor Turn $3,000 To $46.3 Million With PEPE? | Bitcoinist.com


								Tales of crypto investors turning a few dollars into millions are not new, but one particular PEPE investor has taken this a step further. This crypto trader was able to turn a $3,000 investment into $46.3 million in the space of a year. Here’s how they did it.
$3,000 In PEPE Turns Into $46.3 Million
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the on-chain data tracking platform Lookonchain revealed exactly how this crypto trader turned the $3,000 investment into tens of millions of dollars. According to the tracker, the trader had bought $3,000 worth of PEPE tokens on April 15, 2023, which is when the coin launched. The trader received a total of 4.9 trillion tokens in return.

The same year, PEPE would go on a legendary rally, going from under a $1 million market cap to over $1 billion after securing listings from major crypto exchanges such as Binance. At this time, the investor’s stash had risen to more than $10 million. However, the crypto trader would continue to hold their stash and only sell a small portion of it.
Fast forward to May 2024 and the PEPE price has hit multiple new all-time highs. The latest happened this week when the meme coin’s price rose above $0.00001 to cross a $4.5 billion market cap. This move catapulted the trader’s holdings to over $40 million.
Following the price reaching a new all-time high, the crypto trader has begun to take some profit. As Lookonchain’s post shows, the investor recently sold 255 billion tokens for a total of $2.3 million. So far, the trader has sold around 1.4 trillion tokens, leaving them with a balance of 3.5 trillion tokens, which is currently worth a whopping $38.9 million.
In total, this investor has seen a 15,718x return or a 157,718% ROI. Their total realized and unrealized profit from this single trade now sits at $46.3 million at the time of writing.

Is This Crypto Investor An Insider?
Given the timing of the crypto investor’s buys into PEPE when it just launched, it has raised questions of whether this particular investor is an ‘insider’. In other words, some have wondered if this is one of the team members behind the meme coin.

However, others have focused on the sheer grit that it has taken the investor to hold their tokens to this point. One X (formerly Twitter) user points out the fact that the reason the investor was able to make such returns was the fact that they were able to hold, and did not sell early.


For now, the investor seems to be holding the majority of their coins to wait for better prices. Given that the bull market is expected to continue to unfold this year, it is possible that the PEPE price will continue to rally and reach new all-time highs, which would mean higher gains for this smart investor.

Bitcoin Price to Explode to $95,000 ‘In Just One Move,’ Says Top Analyst Who Predicted Recent All-Time High | Cryptoglobe


                                
A popular cryptocurrency trader known for accurately predicting Bitcoin’s recent rise to a new all-time high ahead of its halving event has recently  revealed he believes the price of BTC will surge to the $95,000 level “in just one move.”



The analyst, responding to another popular cryptocurrency trader on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), added that the timing of the move is uncertain, but noted that those who can’t “relax now and wait for Bitcoin to perform as expected” could be better of leaving the market “to avoid the torture.”



Per his words, in the coming months “there will be a lot of pain for those with weak nerves.”







These words came in response to trader Milkybulll Crypto, who shared a chart with their over 60,000 followers on the platform pointing to a cup and handle reversal pattern on Bitcoin’s weekly chart, before adding that the “breakout will be explosive and will send it to a cycle top.”



A cup and handle price pattern on an asset’s chart is a technical indicator where a cup is formed in the shape of the letter “u,” with the handle then coming with the price seeing a slight downward movement. The pattern was first defined by American technician William J. O’Neil, according to Investopedia, which notes the pattern is interpreted as a bullish signal.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The price prediction comes at a time in which another popular cryptocurrency analyst, Rekt Capital, said that the price of Bitcoin after the halving is officially out of the “danger zone,” and the cryptocurrency’s price celebrated with a good bounce from the Re-Accumulation Range Low support.”



Rekt Capital noted that this month and the next may be “unremarkable for Bitcoin,” but added that we’re “running out of unremarkable months” before BTC enters the parabolic phase.



Notably institutional investors are slowly moving in, with the U.S. state of Wisconsin recently becoming the first government entity in the country to disclose an investment in the flagship cryptocurrency, having purchased 94,562 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), worth nearly $100 million, in the first quarter of the year.



The move sees the state of Wisconsin join several Wall Street giants, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, in revealing BTC exposure through investment in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to 13F filings.



JPMorgan revealed an investment of $731,246 in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s GBTC, while Wells Fargo disclosed $141,817 in GBTC holdings. BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon have also made similar disclosures.

                        Paul Ryan – the 54th speaker of the United States House of Representatives – has emerged as a major proponent of stablecoins, with a bright outlook on what regulation could bring to the industry.Paul Ryan Bullish On Stablecoins
In an interview with Bloomberg on Friday, Ryan highlighted stablecoins as a potential solution to the looming US sovereign debt crisis. Public data shows that the nation is currently $34.7 trillion in debt, and is making annual interest payments of over $1 trillion.“I think stablecoin legislation would be a step in the right direction,” he said. “That could be done this year, but I don’t see anything other than that on the horizon.”Stablecoins are crypto tokens that are pegged to relatively value-stable assets – mainly the U.S. dollar. Crypto traders often use them for trading, borrowing, and lending in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, while others use them to access the stability of the dollar in countries where dollars are otherwise unobtainable.Stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle mainly back their tokens with short-term US Treasury bills and other dollar equivalent instruments, while profiting on the interest they provide. As such, rising demand for stablecoins directly translates to demand for US government debt, which is imperative when the government needs lenders.At present, the stablecoin market is over $140 billion in size, but remains unregulated. According to Ryan, a bipartisan agreement on stablecoins making its way through the legislative process could help remedy that, currently being negotiated between Patrick McHenry and Maxine Waters of the House Financial Services Committee.“I think there’s a reasonable chance they could get a deal on stablecoin legislation,” Ryan said. “That means you have a legal framework in which you can have stablecoins deployed… you’d go from a couple hundred billion dollars of stablecoins to maybe trillions.”Another Republican Supporting Crypto
The former speaker said that stablecoins adoption could integrate the dollar into the ongoing digitization of currencies, and entrench dollar adoption overall.“That’s one thing you can try and do on the margins to improve demand for bonds and improve dollar adoption,” he concluded.Ryan’s comments echo a common pro-crypto sentiment among Republicans, who have taken up the mantle of supporting the industry in place of their less-than-favorable Democrat counterparts.Former president Donald Trump, who once blasted Bitcoin as a scam, has recently flipped positions with a promise to keep crypto in America.

Pepe Whales Buy Up Nearly 1 Trillion PEPE As 100% Of Holders in Profit ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
PEPE has emerged as a standout performer in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, with its price surging over 100% in just a month.



Behind this meteoric rise lies a fascinating trend: whales, or large investors, have accumulated a staggering 720 billion Pepe tokens. This accumulation frenzy has coincided with a remarkable statistic—100% of Pepe holders are currently in profit.



Lookonchain, an on-chain platform, recently reported a whale purchasing 520 billion Pepe Coins on May 15. This purchase is seen as a speculative move, suggesting a potential upward trend in the price of PEPE. The whale subsequently withdrew PEPE tokens worth $5.28 million from the Binance cryptocurrency exchange.







Unlike typical traders, this whale is known for holding onto investments for extended periods rather than actively trading. The whale has acquired a total of 10 tokens but has never sold any. Despite the size of the investments, the whale has incurred a net loss of $6.1 million. Only 5 of the 10 tokens are profitable, resulting in a win rate of 50%, as per Lookonchain’s analysis.



Furthermore, a wallet address linked to BlockTower Capital acquired 202 billion tokens valued at $2.2 million through the crypto trading firm Cumberland. Simultaneously, BlockTower Capital’s primary hedge fund has suffered a security breach and partial loss due to fraudulent activities.

These large investors have amassed 720 billion Pepe Coin tokens, indicating a strong bullish sentiment toward the digital asset.



Pepe Profit-Taking and Price Correction



Investors showed significant interest in Pepe Coin, driving its price to a new peak. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that all PEPE traders are currently profitable, suggesting a potential sell-off by large holders.



Despite the positive sentiment and price rally, some whales have begun to book profits, leading to a slight correction in PEPE’s price. The token has fallen by 2.93% in the past 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.00001037. This profit-taking behavior is not unexpected, given the significant price increase in a short period.



The whale accumulation of Pepe tokens by whales has played a crucial role in driving the token’s price to new highs. With 100% of Pepe Coin holders currently in profit, the market sentiment remains overwhelmingly positive. However, profit-taking behavior among whales and selling pressure in the derivatives market could lead to short-term price fluctuations.

2 Years Ago Today: Terra (LUNA) Lost 99.999% of Its Value - A Reminder of Risks Associated with Altcoins ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Today is considered one of the darkest days in the history of the crypto assets market. Terra’s LUNA cryptocurrency started to collapse in the second week of May 2022, but by 15 May 2022, the coin had shed a whopping 99.999% of its value, going from $100 just a week prior to less than $0.002 by the end of the day.



Here is what happened in that eventful week:



Image Source: TradingView



The father of all dumps in the crypto market’s history left tens of thousands of investors holding bags of worthless LUNA tokens. Overall, investors are said to have lost more than $7 billion on this coin.



Why did LUNA Collapse?



LUNA’s value was set up in such a way that Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin US Terra (UST)’s fluctuations would be handled by LUNA’s liquidity. In hindsight, it was an absurd model that something as fluctuating as a cryptocurrency with no use case could make a stablecoin “stable”. UST, too, had nothing backing it.



Once UST lost 40% of its value, LUNA nosedived and has yet to recover from it. Some bear market traders were able to make some money from the wild fluctuations of LUNA (now LUNC), but that was it. There were reports of investors losing hundreds of thousands of dollars and their entire life savings on the digital token. It wasn’t a pleasant sight.

What Happened to Terra’s Founder?



Do Kwon, the Korean founder of the Terra project, fled and remained a fugitive for many months before he was finally caught in Montenegro’s international airport, and an extradition battle began. Both South Korea and the United States wanted him on their soil so he could answer for his financial crimes. Eventually, it was decided that he would be sent to the East Asian country, and he is facing a lengthy period behind bars.



Before he was arrested, Do Kwon attempted to conjure up a face-saving for the token project and launched another crypto to compensate the affected people. The resulting coin was also called LUNA, while the previous one was rechristened LUNC. But nothing saved the doomed coin, and both are pretty worthless now.



The Aftermath



The LUNA fiasco highlighted the fragility of the altcoin market. While Bitcoin has remained relatively stable most of the time, altcoins have been a mixed bag overall, with many coins failing. LUNA was overshadowed the same year by an even bigger fraud in the form of the FTX exchange scandal. Do Kwon and former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried remain public enemies no.1 and 2 in crypto circles.



The episode reminds investors to be careful when investing in risky endeavors like many altcoins.

5 Things to Know Ahead of the ‘Notcoin’ Token Launch - Decrypt

The Notcoin token is finally here—well, almost. After a couple of missed deadlines in April, the NOT token on The Open Network (TON) is set to launch in a matter of hours, with exchanges like Binance and OKX set to list the token on May 16.Tens of millions of players will also be able to claim their NOT allocations at the same time, which means Notcoin is poised to be not only one of the biggest gaming token launches of 2024, but possibly one of the biggest overall crypto drops in 2024.If you haven’t been following the latest updates, then there are a few key things that you need to know, whether you’re planning to claim your NOT tokens, purchase them, or perhaps try to earn some through staking campaigns. Here’s a quick, final primer before the Notcoin rollout.1) Staking campaignsWhile there was already a substantial player base, Notcoin also worked with notable crypto exchanges Binance and OKX to seed billions of NOT tokens to their respective customer bases, perhaps opening up a broader audience of NOT holders and traders.But that window is closing fast. Between the two campaigns, more than 4 billion NOT tokens were offered to users who staked other cryptocurrencies. And Binance users jumped hard at the opportunity, staking some $14 billion to grab a share of the rewards.As of this writing, there are only a couple of hours left to secure rewards via Binance, but several hours left to do so through OKX—so act fast if you still can.2) When listing?According to official Notcoin posts on Wednesday, the token will be listed on major exchanges at 12:00 UTC on Thursday—that’s 9am Eastern.Binance, OKX, Bybit, KuCoin, and Bitfinex are among those who have already announced plans to list the token right away. The total supply of NOT is just over 102.7 billion tokens, with about 80.2 billion offered to players via the airdrop claim.3) Claim your coinsIf you mined in-game coins between January and April 1, the end of the mining phase, then you can claim your on-chain NOT tokens. Some 35 million total players hopped into the Telegram-based clicker game, and NOT tokens are being awarded at a 1,000-to-1 conversation rate. So if you mined 100,000 in-game coins, you’ll have 100 NOT to claim.Notcoin opened up the in-game claim process to all players on Tuesday, beginning with the ability to either transfer the tokens to a centralized exchange account or stake them for future rewards and access—more on that in a moment. On Thursday, once the token has been listed, Notcoin will add the ability to withdraw any earned NOT to a self-custody wallet, as well.4) Should you stake?For some players, the NOT token launch might end their planned journey with Notcoin. Crypto traders “farm” airdrops all the time, and this one was simple and widely known. But Open Builders, the team behind Notcoin, aims to keep some of those millions of users onboard.When you go to claim your NOT tokens, Notcoin will ask whether you want to stake (or lock) your tokens within the game for a period of 30 days—which means you won’t be able to withdraw or sell them during that span.But in doing so, Notcoin says that you’ll be able to “Explore & earn extra rewards” and gain “Exclusive access” to staking pools based on your player level. Keeping your tokens locked up for a month is a risk, as with any crypto decision, but it’s one that could yield future benefits if you’re in no rush to cash out and move on.5) What’s next?Notcoin will bring back its coin-tapping game and launch a new kind of rewards model, but there are grander ambitions ahead, as Open Builders co-founder Sasha Plotvinov has shared with Decrypt’s GG.In the short term, Notcoin will bring back the familiar game with the added ability to earn real NOT tokens instead of more in-game coins. But with all the tokens minted and deployed, there will be a new model. Projects and companies will be able to buy NOT on the market and pay it into the game to fuel play-to-earn rewards, sharing tokens with players who engage with their content.Beyond that, Plotvinov shared that Notcoin aims to become the “Netflix of social, viral games,” serving as a platform for third-party developers to deploy their simple, addictive games that can potentially reach a sizable audience—with token rewards, of course.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Crypto enters the American Presidential Election cycle - Brave New Coin

For the first time, Bitcoin and crypto is set to take center stage in an American Presidential Election cycle. President Trump is positioning himself as the first major party nominee to actively court Bitcoin and crypto holders. 
For the first time, Bitcoin and crypto is set to take center stage in an American Presidential Election cycle. Donald Trump has reversed course on crypto and is now positioning himself as the first major party nominee to actively court Bitcoin and crypto holders.
Addressing crypto enthusiasts at Mar-a-Lago last week, Trump’s message was clear: support him or face the Biden administration’s stringent regulatory measures against the industry. “They are against it,” he declared during an event promoting his own non-fungible token (NFT).
This overt appeal to the crypto faithful marks a significant departure from Trump’s previous criticisms of Bitcoin during his first term, though it is not entirely unexpected. The GOP has increasingly embraced digital assets, contrasting with Democrats who remain divided on granting legitimacy to the industry, with Elizabeth Warren leading an anit-crypto army.
Trump’s direct endorsement signifies a pivotal moment for the American crypto industry, which has intensified lobbying efforts and invested millions to influence the upcoming 2024 elections.

Trump at Mar a Lago with Messari Crypto Advocate Ryan Selkis, via X
The issue has become a fresh line of attack for Trump against Biden. SEC Chair Gary Gensler, appointed by Biden, has pursued aggressive enforcement actions against crypto firms for alleged violations of federal securities laws. Trump criticized the administration’s stance, asserting, “The Democrats are very much against it.”
However, not all Democrats oppose crypto. Despite Biden’s veto threat, twenty-one Democrats joined Republicans in voting to overturn SEC crypto guidance. Yet, Trump’s embrace introduces a new partisan dynamic into the debate over crypto regulation, potentially complicating the industry’s bipartisan outreach efforts.
Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey is working with Donald Trump’s campaign to develop their Bitcoin and cryptocurrency policies. He wrote on X, “For the past month we have been working with the Trump campaign to develop their bitcoin and crypto policy agenda. We proposed a comprehensive executive order for President Trump to sign on day 1. I will be sharing those details soon. This week Trump took the first step, but there is much work to do. We intend to raise a $100m war chest for the campaign to ensure the next President of the United States is pro Bitcoin. If you can help, please reach out.”
Trump told the crowd that President Joe Biden “doesn’t even know” what crypto is. “If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, if you are in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump,” he added.
Trump’s campaign will accept donations in crypto, it’s expected that this will result in a sizable war chest.

U.S. Indicts Brothers for Attack on Ethereum Trading Bots | Cryptopolitan

Two brothers, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno, stand indicted by U.S. authorities for a calculated assault on Ethereum trading bots that shook the core of blockchain security.This sophisticated crime spree unfolded last year, prompting a rigorous investigation that culminated in the unveiling of charges by the Department of Justice on Wednesday.The brothers that laundered money through cryptoThe duo faces allegations of wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. Their operation reportedly compromised the Ethereum blockchain’s integrity, nabbing roughly $25 million in cryptocurrencies—all within a dizzying span of about 12 seconds.Their arrest earlier this week in Massachusetts and New York marks a significant breakthrough in the case.April 2023 saw the execution of their daring exploit. They targeted automated bots designed to capitalize on trading efficiencies—bots that attempt to anticipate and profit from pending transaction orders on the Ethereum network.These bots, driven by a concept known as Maximum Extractable Value (MEV), exploit the lag between transaction announcement and confirmation for profit.The brothers concocted a deceitful lure, initiating at least eight rigged transactions known to attract the bots into a trap, capitalizing on a now-fixed vulnerability in MEV-Boost software.Each trapped transaction coerced the bots into buying large volumes of hardly liquid cryptocurrencies using $25 million in various stablecoins.DOJ accuses them of deception and concealmentTo elude capture, Anton and James masked their identities using shell companies and anonymous cryptocurrency addresses.Post-attack, they meticulously moved the pilfered cryptocurrency through numerous transactions aimed at obscuring its origins and true ownership.Their preparatory work was extensive. They researched know-your-customer (KYC) standards and legal extradition intricacies, evidently planning their steps with meticulous precision. They also delved into potential charges they could face, arming themselves with knowledge to stay ahead of law enforcement.Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco remarked on the case, emphasizing the technological sophistication and unprecedented nature of the scheme—a plot hatched over months and executed in mere seconds.The indictment provides a detailed account of the Ethereum blockchain operation, explaining the role of validators—those who confirm and secure transactions—and the ‘mempool,’ where transactions wait before confirmation.The MEV-boost software in question facilitates the assembly of these transactions into blocks, allowing so-called ‘searchers’ to optimize trading strategies that could potentially undercut standard user profits.The mechanics of their exploitationsThe crux of the brothers’ strategy involved creating 16 Ethereum validators to pinpoint and exploit three specific traders’ bots.They sent out bait transactions to analyze the bots’ trading patterns. Subsequently, they drew these bots to a validator they controlled, which was about to validate a new block.Here, they executed the crux of their strategy: they preempted the bots, tampered with block transactions by swapping in fraudulent digital signatures, and swapped out genuine transactions for deceptive ones.The targeted bots ended up buying worthless cryptocurrencies at high volumes, thinking they were securing valuable assets.This left the victim traders with significant losses, as they were unable to sell the devalued cryptocurrencies, effectively stranding $25 million in more liquid assets like stablecoins, which the brothers then absconded with.Finally, the laundering of these ill-gotten gains was meticulously planned. The brothers converted the stolen cryptocurrencies into DAI and then into USDC, further masking their trail.Special Agent in Charge Thomas Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation New York Field Office highlighted this operation as a novel form of blockchain manipulation, one that involved advanced knowledge of Ethereum’s inner workings and substantial technical expertise.

New Law in Oklahoma Establishes Legal Framework for Blockchain | Cryptopolitan

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt has recently put his signature on a groundbreaking bill that sets up a legal framework specifically for blockchain technology and digital assets.This decisive move aims to position Oklahoma as a hub for digital innovation, ensuring that the state remains at the forefront of technological advancement in the crypto industry.Oklahoma Introduces Legal Protections in CryptoThe newly signed law is a robust step towards integrating blockchain into everyday practices by eliminating restrictive measures on the usage of cryptoassets.Specifically, the law ensures that these assets, when used for legal transactions or held in self-custody, will not be burdened by any additional taxes or fees that aren’t imposed on traditional payment methods.This provision showcases Oklahoma’s commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment that respects the autonomy of digital transactions.Introduced by State Representative Brian Hill in January, this legislation also addresses the specifics of crypto mining. It allows residents to engage in mining operations within residential zones, provided they comply with local noise ordinances.On the other hand, businesses operating in industrial zones will not face any new noise restrictions aside from existing regulations. This balanced approach ensures that the growth of the crypto industry does not disrupt community standards.Oklahoma’s Classification of Blockchain is a WinUnder this new legal structure, blockchain is defined comprehensively. It is described as data shared across a network that creates a ledger of verified transactions.These transactions are maintained through cryptography, which secures the integrity of data exchanges and facilitates updates among network participants. This definition covers not only the technical aspects but also the operational dynamics of blockchain technology.The law further elaborates on several key terms in the blockchain and digital asset ecosystem:Digital Assets: This includes cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other digital-only assets that confer economic or proprietary rights.Digital Asset Mining: Defined as the process of using electricity to power computers or nodes that secure blockchain networks.Node: A computational device that maintains and updates a blockchain copy, ensuring the ledger’s accuracy and up-to-date status.Self-Hosted Wallets and Hardware Wallets: Tools that allow users to securely store and manage their digital assets independently of third-party services.Framework Supports Miners and Node OperatorsSections of the law detail the legalities surrounding digital asset mining and the operation of nodes. For instance, individuals engaged in home mining must adhere to local noise standards but will enjoy the freedom to mine without facing discriminatory regulatory practices.Similarly, crypto mining businesses are allowed to operate within industrially zoned areas without facing additional noise-related restrictions beyond what is already required for other industrial entities.Additionally, the law stipulates that operating a node or engaging in staking—committing digital assets to support a blockchain network—does not require a money transmitter license.This significant ruling opens up the field for more individuals and businesses to participate in blockchain operations without undergoing the cumbersome and often costly licensing processes typically associated with financial services.One of the most crucial aspects of the legislation is the protection it offers to crypto owners. The law explicitly states that neither the state nor local governments can impose taxes or charges on crypto transactions unless similar liabilities exist for transactions conducted with U.S. legal tender.Moreover, any attempts by local governments to rezone areas to disadvantage mining operations can be legally contested, providing a safeguard against discriminatory practices.

Bitcoin Self-Custody Enshrined As a Right In Oklahoma - Decrypt

Oklahoma has become the first U.S. state to pass a law protecting the right to self-custody Bitcoin.The new law says citizens cannot be prevented from holding and controlling digital assets using a hardware wallet. It also says that the state government cannot ban or restrict the use of crypto to purchase legal goods and services.The so-called ‘Bitcoin Rights’ bill—HB3594—was signed into law by Oklahoma’s Republican governor Kevin Stitt Monday, and the non-profit Satoshi Action Fund says more states will follow suit.“I think that at the end of the day, lawmakers across the country are very open to this type of policy,” the fund's CEO and co-founder Dennis Porter told Decrypt.The bill also mentions digital asset mining, allowing ordinary citizens to take part in the industry—within limits.“It shall be legal in the State of Oklahoma to participate in home digital asset mining as long as the person engaging in home digital asset mining complies with all local noise ordinances,” the law reads. Crypto mining involves minting new coins and keeping digital coin networks running. It is an energy-intensive industry that uses large amounts of hardware, space, and resources. Most Bitcoin mining operations today are industrial-scale operations that can generate a lot of noise.The Satoshi Action Fund created the template for the bill, which has been introduced in 15 other states. The Oklahoma Bitcoin Association helped educate lawmakers on the benefits of Bitcoin and played a major part in making Oklahoma the first state to pass the bill into law, Porter said.Crypto has become an increasingly hot political topic, and one evolving along partisan lines. At the national level, at least, Democrats typically focus on the potential threats of the technology, while Republicans oppose regulations that they say hamstring innovation in a globally competitive marketplace.Porter said similar laws are inevitably coming to other states—and that it isn’t a “left versus right” issue.“Elizabeth Warren is a major figure in the Biden administration,” he said, referring to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, an outspoken crypto critic. “It’s really like Elizabeth Warren and her banking henchmen friends that are influencing federal policy.”“As we see the technology growing in attention, and getting more and more scrutiny, we do see folks on the left taking a closer look and not just believing what the mainstream media tells them about this technology,” Porter added.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitcoin Price Could go ‘Vertical’ when BTC Miner Revenue Recovers, Historical Data Shows | Cryptoglobe


                                
Popular cryptocurrency analyst PlanB, who is widely recognized in the crypto community, has suggested that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin could soon go “vertical,” based on historical data.



PlanB, known for his stock-to-flow (S2F) model for predicting Bitcoin’s price, recently shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) that historical data shows Bitcoin miner revenue takes between two and five months to recover after a halving, and that “after that bitcoin price goes vertical.”



PlanB’s analysis aligns with historical trends. Bitcoin miner revenue has demonstrably grown over time, with peaks often occurring in the months following a halving. This rise in revenue often coincides with a high relative strength index (RSI), an indicator of potential buying pressure.







The analyst has, as CryptoGlobe reported, predicted the price of Bitcoin would reach $500,000 this year based on key technical indicators and their past influence on the cryptocurrency price.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

In a video at the time, he noted that Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI), a technical indicator meant to chart the current and historical strength or weakness of an asset‘s recent price changes, appears to be mirroring a historical pattern that in the past indicated major price surges.



PlanB elaborated on his interpretation of the data, stating that as we approach Bitcoin’s halving event, which will cut the supply of newly created tokens in half next year, its RSI is moving up. Per his words we “should be prepared for market volatility,” and a direct ascent is “unlikely.”



The analyst noted that if the pattern holds, he anticipates a bullish surge in 2024 with the RSI hovering around 90, while in 2025 and 2026 he sees the cryptocurrency endure a bearish trend.

OpenAI Loses Two More Leaders-What Does That Mean for AI Safety? - Decrypt

The same week OpenAI commanded global attention for releasing its latest AI model, prominent executives Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike announced that they were leaving the company. Coupled with the February departure of Andrej Karpathy, it appears the people most committed to safe, human-centered AI development have left the company.Has the top name in AI lost its brake pedal in the intense race to dominate the massively disruptive industry?The failed coupIt was early 2023 when Sutskever, co-founder and former chief scientist, was credited with being the mastermind behind a controversial move to oust CEO Sam Altman over alleged concerns that he was cavalier about AI safety protocols. His dramatic removal led to breathless headlines and widespread rumors, but Altman was restored to his post a week later.Sutskever soon issued an apology and resigned from OpenAI's board—and had not made any public statements or appearances since.Indeed, when OpenAI presented its much hyped product update on Monday, Sutskever was notably absent.Sutskever announced his official departure just two days later. His resignation statement was cordial, as was Altman’s public acknowledgement.“After almost a decade, I have made the decision to leave OpenAI,” Sutskever wrote. ”The company’s trajectory has been nothing short of miraculous, and I’m confident that OpenAI will build AGI that is both safe and beneficial under the leadership of (Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and Mira Murati).“It was an honor and a privilege to have worked together, and I will miss everyone dearly,” he continued, adding that he was moving on to focus on a personally meaningful project.“This is very sad to me; Ilya is easily one of the greatest minds of our generation, a guiding light of our field, and a dear friend,” Sam Altman said, “OpenAI would not be what it is without him.” He also replied to Sutskever’s announcement with a nice short messageShortly after, OpenAI announced that Jakub Panochi would be filling Sutskever’s position. Panochi previously served as Director of Research and had a more technical job, focusing mostly on scaling AI.But there may be something more to the changing of the guard. When Sutskever announced his resignation, he only followed a few Twitter accounts, including OpenAI and a dachshund meme account. Someone named Adam Sulik, a self-described “AI centrist,” replied to the announcement, suggesting Sutskever ignore any non-disclosure agreements he may still be subject and share insider information in the name of humanity.Sutskever followed Sulik after his comment... then unfollowed him a few hours later.As it turned out, Sutskever wasn't alone in heading for the exit. Just hours later, Jan Leike—who co-founded OpenAI's "superalignment" team with Sutskever to ensure ethical, long-term AI development—resigned with a frosty tweet simply stating, "I resigned."No pleasantries, no praise for OpenAI, and no reactions from OpenAI execs.Leike had worked at Google’s Deepmind before joining OpenAI. At the latter firm, the superalignment team focused on ensuring that cutting-edge systems in which AI’s are expected to meet or exceed human intelligence remain aligned with human values and intentions.Not much is known about this group of AI safety sentries, however. Besides the two leaders, OpenAI has not provided any additional information about the unit other than the fact that there are other “researchers and engineers from [its] previous alignment team, as well as researchers from other teams across the company.”Sulik also commented on Leike’s resignation, sharing his concern about the time of the events.“Seeing Jan leave right after Ilya doesn’t bode well for humanity’s safe path forward,“ he tweeted.OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.These departures come months after OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy left the company, saying in February that he wanted to pursue personal projects. Karpathy worked as research scientist at OpenAI and was involved in different projects from computer vision applications to AI assistants and key developments during the training of ChatGPT. He took a five-year break from the company between 2017 and 2022 to lead AI development at Tesla.With these three departures, OpenAI is left without some of the most important minds pursuing an ethical approach toward AGI.Decels out, new deals inThere are signs that the failed ouster of Altman removed resistance to more lucrative but ethically cloudy opportunities.Shortly after reinstating Altman, for example, OpenAI loosened restrictions on using its tech for potentially harmful applications like weapons development—guidelines that previously banned such activities outright.In addition to striking the deal with the Pentagon, OpenAI also opened a plugin store enabling anyone to design and share personalized AI assistants, effectively diluting direct oversight. Most recently, the company began “exploring” the creation of adult content.The diminishing strength of ethics advocates and guidelines extends beyond Open AI. Microsoft axed its entire ethics and society team in January, and Google sidelining its Responsible AI taskforce that same month. Meta, meanwhile, disbanding its ethical AI crew. All three tech giants are meanwhile in a mad dash to dominate the AI market.There’s clear reason for concern. AI products are already massively mainstream, a social phenomenon with billions of interactions per day. There appears to be growing potential for unaligned AI to adversely impact the development of future generations in business, political, community, and even family affairs.The rise of philosophical movements like "effective accelerationism"—which values rapid development over ethical worries—exacerbates these concerns.For now, the main remaining bastion of caution appears to be a mix of open source development, voluntary participation in AI safety coalitions—such as the Frontier Model Forum or MLCommons, —and outright regulation by the government, from the AI Act in the UK to the G7’s code of AI conduct.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Bitcoin Surges Past $64,000 as U.S. Core Inflation Hits Three-Year Low



                    

On May 15, Bitcoin soared past $64,000, coinciding with the announcement of lower-than-expected core inflation rates in the United States. 



This significant increase in Bitcoin’s value occurred after the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which reflected a positive outlook for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. 




As a result, Bitcoin reached a local high of $64,700, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.



The CPI report for April indicated a month-on-month increase of 0.3%, which was 0.1% below the anticipated figures. 



This data suggested a decrease in core inflation to its lowest point since 2021, hinting at potential cuts in interest rates. 




However, reactions to these statistics were mixed. 



The Kobeissi Letter expressed caution, noting that while CPI inflation had decreased for the first time in three months, the Producer Price Index (PPI) had risen for the third consecutive month. 



They highlighted that “The Fed will remain in wait and see mode,” acknowledging the complexities of the economic indicators.



Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell maintained a cautiously optimistic tone, despite mixed signals from recent economic reports. 




“I wouldn’t call it hot, I’d call it mixed,” Powell remarked about the PPI data in a statement reported by Reuters.



Despite the positive CPI data, market expectations for immediate rate cuts remained low. 



According to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, the likelihood of a rate cut in June was just 3.1%, with a slightly higher expectation of 28.3% for July.

The cryptocurrency market reacted swiftly to these economic developments. 



CoinGlass reported significant activity in Bitcoin exchanges, where prices surged, breaking past liquidity barriers and forming a new resistance level around $65,000. 



This dynamic shift indicated a strong buy-in from market participants.



Skew, a prominent trader, commented on the situation, emphasizing the need for continued buying pressure to maintain Bitcoin’s momentum. 



He suggested that for Bitcoin to lead the market confidently, it would need to surpass the $65,000 mark to restore market confidence.



In summary, Bitcoin’s price surge on May 15 was closely tied to the latest U.S. economic data, demonstrating the cryptocurrency’s sensitivity to global economic indicators and market sentiments. 



The mixed economic data has left the market in a state of cautious anticipation regarding future Federal Reserve actions.

Analyst Says Ethereum Rival Mirroring Memecoin That Just Printed New All-Time High, Updates Outlook on Altcoins - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto strategist thinks that an Ethereum (ETH) challenger is following in the footsteps of a red-hot memecoin that just hit a fresh record high.
Pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 393,500 followers on the social media platform X that the market structure of layer-1 protocol Near (NEAR) looks similar to Pepe’s (PEPE), a memecoin that printed a new all-time high in the last 24 hours.










“Looks identical to PEPE and with my expectation of some relief across the board here I think dips are for buying, targeting the highs.
I’m long as of last night.” 
Source: Credible/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to be targeting $9 for NEAR with invalidation at $5.72. At time of writing, NEAR is trading for $7.03, suggesting an upside potential of nearly 30% if the altcoin hits Credible’s target.
But while Credible is bullish on NEAR, he says his sentiment does not extend to Pepe and large-cap altcoins. The analyst says that Pepe and major altcoins are inching toward a big corrective move as he believes market participants are rotating their capital to ride the next burst to the upside for Bitcoin (BTC).
“Pepe and major alts = in a ranging environment which I believe is a distribution top ultimately leading to breakdowns.
Bitcoin = in a ranging environment which I believe is a reaccumulation range ultimately leading to a breakout to $100,000.” 
At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $61,655.

Shiba Inu Big Buyers Return: What The 2,300% Spike In Whale Volume Means For Price | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu (SHIB) is again on top as crypto whales return to the meme coin’s ecosystem. On-chain data shows that these high-volume investors have been recently accumulating the meme coin, which could ultimately affect its price. 
Shiba Inu Sees Spike In Whale Transactions
Data from the on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock shows that Shiba Inu saw a 2,300% increase in its daily large transaction volume, amounting to $223 million. This category of transactions exceeds $100,000 and is usually made by traders called “whales.” This development presents a bullish signal for the meme coin, as whales are known to significantly impact a coin’s price discovery. 

Therefore, a surge in Shiba Inu’s price looks inevitable, as whale accumulation usually leads to an upward trend in the token’s price. Meanwhile, other metrics paint a bullish outlook for the meme coin. For instance, there has also been an increase in the daily active addresses and transactions, which suggests that crypto investors are actively trading the meme coin. 
Shiba Inu’s burn rate is also up in the past seven days with over 143 million SHIB tokens burned during that period. Shiba Inu’s fundamentals are also strong. The meme coin recently secured a listing on the cryptocurrency payment platform CoinGate. 
This listing is expected to expand Shiba Inu’s offerings. Users can use the meme coin to process some commercial transactions, including paying for Airbnb accommodations and purchasing from certain brands like Nike and Zalando. 
However, despite such a bullish outlook, the layer-2 network Shibarium is still lagging, which will undoubtedly be a cause for concern for the ecosystem. Data from the Shibariumscan shows that the network has continued to record daily transactions under 10,000. This is a far cry from when Shibarium recorded millions in daily transactions.
SHIB’s Next Move On The Charts
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently provided insights into Shiba Inu’s future trajectory. In an X (formerly Twitter) post, he mentioned that the meme coin could witness a “20% upswing to $0.00002954” if it breaks the upper boundary of this descending parallel channel at $0.00002444. 
Source: X
Crypto analyst DamiDefi also revealed in an X post that Shiba Inu had formed a falling wedge on the daily time frame. He claimed that if the meme coin breaks out from its current price level, Shiba Inu could experience a price pump of over 50%. 
Source: X

Shiba Inu could, however, be held back by Bitcoin’s tepid price action as data from IntoTheBlock shows that the meme coin still has a strong price correlation with the flagship crypto. Shiba Inu recorded a significant rally on May 13 and looked to be experiencing a bullish reversal, but that wasn’t the case as it faced a sharp correction, declining alongside Bitcoin. 
At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00002404, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

GameStop Bull Roaring Kitty Keeps Sharing Movie Memes-What's He Telling Us? - Decrypt

Famed GameStop trader Roaring Kitty’s apparent return to Twitter has rocked the social media and financial landscape. But what on earth is he tweeting about?Rather than returning with his trademark GME YOLO updates or analysis of his darling stock GameStop, he started posting movie memes, with iconic scenes and inspiring monologues cut together and edited by the meme influencer. In turn, people have tried to decipher what he’s trying to say.Keith Gill, best known as Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue, was a key figure in the 2021 GameStop short squeeze. Prior to disappearing in 2021, his Twitter account would often post movie memes similar to what he posts today. But due to his three-year radio silence, the memes now hold more weight—and are driving massive trading action.So, here at Decrypt we’ve gathered the most notable movie mentions and attempted to bleed some meaning out of it."Fine, I'll do it myself"Movies: "Avengers: Age of Ultron" (2015) and "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" (2009)The memer started his movie posting spree with Thanos from “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” shown putting on the Infinity Gauntlet and saying, “Fine, I’ll do it myself.” This told the world that he was going to be hands-on with his return—just like the Marvel villain was with his goal of halving the population of the universe via the powerful Infinity Stones.It then cuts to a scene from “X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” where the titular superhero is being experimented on by scientists. Wolverine grows his adamantium-laced claws and wakes up from the sedation he’s been put under—which appears to be Roaring Kitty basically saying “I’m back and ready to mess the game up.”However, looking deeper into the original scene, the superhero voluntarily went under sedation by the scientists. Does this mean that Twitter’s favorite GameStop influencer was asked to be silent by a group and he agreed? Or are we reading too deep into this comic book movie clip?"It's over"Movie/TV Show: "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986) and "Breaking Bad" S1E1 (2012)In his second movie tweet, the memer references both “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” and “Breaking Bad”—both classics in their own right. It starts with Ferris saying, “You’re still here? It’s over,” and then Walter White responding, “We’re done when I say we’re done.”This is an obvious reference to the “It’s so over” meme that degens spout when their investment isn’t looking too great. Many believed that the GameStop saga was over with the disappearance of Roaring Kitty and GameStop failing with multiple attempts to capitalize on its 2021 fame. But Gill, represented as Walter White, is apparently saying that it’s not over until he says so.Change of directionMovies: "Furious 7" (2015) and "Drive" (2011)Beginning with the iconic scene from “Furious 7,” the “Fast and Furious” film released after Paul Walker’s death, Roaring Kitty is painting the picture that he planned to part ways with meme stock investing. That is, until the middle clip—which isn’t from a movie—shows a driver harshly handbrake-turning, just before a clip from “Drive” shows Ryan Gosling cruising through the streets, carefully watching who is following.This appears to suggest that Roaring Kitty considered leaving the scene forever, but had a sharp change of judgment. What sparked this change? Who knows. But now he’s back, patrolling the financial streets, and watching his back—like the getaway driver from the movie “Drive”—so he doesn’t get screwed like last time."Dog days are over"TV Show and Movie: "Sherlock" S2E1 (2012) and "Remember the Titans" (2000)This appears to be a warning to those investing in dog coins. A scene from BBC’s “Sherlock” series shows Irene Adler about to be executed when the famed detective saves her by telling her to run. This feels like Roaring Kitty is directly speaking to us.After a brief clip from “Remember the Titans” where the cast begins to sing “Ain't No Mountain High Enough” by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, it cuts to the music video for “Dog Days Are Over” by Florence & The Machine.A message to get out of the dog coins? Some speculated that this was a call to invest in cat coins instead, but maybe Gill’s not implying that much.Avengers initiativeMovies: "Iron Man" (2008) and "Avengers: Endgame" (2019)This one’s pretty straightforward: It’s a rallying call. He wants to unite the meme stock scene to take down Thanos, who he previously referred to as himself—but in this context we’ll assume that it’s the hedge funds the scene wanted to pummel the last time around."They found a loophole"Movie: "Old School" (2003)“They found a loophole,” the clip from buddy comedy “Old School” begins. “As stupid as they appear, they’re actually very good at paperwork.”This could be in reference to how many GameStop investors felt screwed over by the traditional finance world. A prime example of this is when Robinhood suspended GameStop trading, which some Reddit traders believed was only legal due to a loophole. As for the second half of the clip, which continues to showcase the frat bros dancing in unison? No clue. But it’s funny!Three years of nightsMovie: "The Batman" (2022)Roaring Kitty apparently paints a picture of what life has been like since he left. It’s been dark, he’s been a nocturnal animal. But now he’s returned, and he’s sending a message to the financial world: Be afraid. Also, maybe he’s Batman?"Requel"Movies: "Scream" (2022)Last year’s film adaptation “Dumb Money” covered the 2021 GameStop short squeeze with Paul Dano starring as Roaring Kitty himself. In this tweet, it appears that the real trader thinks the film itself was kinda dumb, too.He’s come back to release a “requel” of the 2021 short squeeze to make up for the film released last year. What has he noticed? Will the short squeeze be for GameStop?GameStooooooooooooooopMovie: "Braveheart" (1995)He finally said it. Up until this point, none of Roaring Kitty’s tweets had directly mentioned the meme stock that made him famous. Does this mean that everything he’s hinting at in these videos applies to GameStop? Or is it just a nod to his roots?It’s also very powerful to think that GameStop is synonymous with freedom. Power to secondhand video games… and the endless stacks of Funko Pop toys that seem to clog up most of the stores nowadays.Keeping it realTV Show: "Chappelle’s Show" S2E7 (2004)It appears that Roaring Kitty has been pissed off somehow. We’re not sure by who or how he was aggravated, but it seems like something that he’s been holding in for some time. He’s done playing Mr. Nice Guy and is reintroducing himself, no longer taking anyone’s crap.There are threads running through the tweets of Roaring Kitty. There are many rallying cries, including messages to his followers that there is a tough battle ahead, and that it’s time to fight in the financial markets.He hints at possible reasons why he’s been silent during these three years. Perhaps he just hasn't seen any financial opportunities arise; maybe he was silenced, or was just being polite. Whatever the case, he’s changed his mind and is putting pedal to the metal. It appears he’s seen something that will rival the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, something he’s calling a “requel.” It could be GameStop, non-dog meme coins, or maybe there’s something we’ve missed. We don’t know for sure, but until Roaring Kitty posts something more substantial than movie, TV, and music video mash-ups with rousing messages attached, we’ll keep analyzing them for clues.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

                        Two Russian teenagers have been arrested in a crackdown on a suspected crypto-powered “money laundering” ring, a police source claimed on May 14.Per the news agency URA, an unnamed “law enforcement agency” member in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug said the teenage brothers “attracted other teens” in the region to their scheme.Russian Teens Ran ‘Crypto Exchange’ with ‘Organized Crime Gang’
The source claimed that some of the teens’ parents sent a “statement” to law enforcement agencies in the region in April.The parents reportedly told police officers that “an organized crime group” had “involved their children” in what appears to be an illegal crypto exchange operation.Police appear to have been ignorant of the scheme before the tip-off, but launched a probe shortly after.The source claimed that the two brothers offered fellow teens “small financial benefits” for processing crypto-related transactions through their bank accounts.One of the teens transacted almost $22,000 worth of crypto exchange-related funds through their bank account in the space of two months, the source added.This helped the teen earn cash worth around $4,400, which he “hid under his pillow at home,” the source concluded.The Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug on a map of Russia.

The case has reportedly drawn the attention of the federal investigative agency, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation.Committee chief Alexander Bastrykin has also personally “intervened,” the media outlet reported.

USDC Issuer Circle Eyes Setting up Shop in US Ahead of IPO - DailyCoin


        

USDC issuer Circle is relocating from Ireland to the US. 



The company has not disclosed the reason behind its move.



All indications suggest that its potential IPO is a driving factor.




Circle, the issuer of the industry’s second-largest stablecoin, USDC, is planning to shift its legal base to the US from its current home of Ireland. The move will see the company depart from low corporate levies in favor of navigating more onerous taxes and a murky regulatory infrastructure, and here’s why. 



Circle Sets the Stage for an IPO



A company spokesperson confirmed to multiple publications that Circle’s parent company has initiated the necessary paperwork with the High Court of the Republic of Ireland to redomicile its firm, though the specific reason remains undisclosed.




Circle’s decision to relocate to the US could be influenced by its potential initial public offering (IPO), for which the company confidentially filed for its equity securities in January of this year. However, aside from the IPO, the move could appear less appealing due to the US’s complex regulatory landscape and high tax rates, contrasting Ireland’s lucrative corporate tax environment.



Earlier this year, Circle announced that it had submitted a draft registration statement S-1 form to the SEC as part of its efforts to go public. Details regarding share quantity and pricing are yet to be finalized, pending SEC review, and are subject to market and other conditions.



Circle’s decision to redomicile could indicate positive feedback on its IPO application from the SEC, suggesting progress in the company’s journey towards becoming a publicly traded entity and closing the gap on its main competitor. 



Circle to Break Out of Tether’s Shadow?



Circle has long operated in the shadow of its main rival, Tether, which boasts a market capitalization of over $111 billion, far surpassing the former’s $33 billion. 




While USDC has demonstrated exceptional performance over the past year, frequently flipping USDT in monthly transactions, an IPO could propel Circle much closer to Tether. If Circle successfully navigates the intricate process and stringent requirements of becoming a publicly traded company, it could gain favor among institutional investors and become ‘Wall Street’s stablecoin.’ 



This is particularly significant as Tether navigates turbulent waters, after regulators implicated the issuer in numerous money laundering and terror financing instances.



On The Flipside




In 2021, Circle tried to go public through a merger with Concord Acquisition Corp.; however, that arrangement didn’t see the light of day. 



Circle’s biggest competitor, Tether, is based in the British Virgin Islands.




Why This Matters



The United States may not seem the most appealing choice for major crypto companies seeking relocation, especially in light of the regulatory crackdown on the industry. Transitioning from a more crypto-friendly jurisdiction to the US might raise some eyebrows. However, this move holds significant importance for Circle and could position USDC in closer competition with Tether as the latter endeavors to restore its reputation.Franklin Templeton’s Jenny Johnson is astonished by blockchain technology:Franklin Templeton CEO Excited About Future with On-Chain ETFsAre Bitcoin Runes a flop?

DOJ charges 2 people over $25 million ETH theft via MEV exploit

The DOJ arrested and charged two individuals on May 15 over an alleged $25 million MEV exploit that occurred on the Ethereum blockchain.The defendants — brothers Anton and James Pepaire-Bueno — face three charges of conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering, each with a potential 20-year sentence.Line of attackThe defendants’ plan involved several steps focused on Ethereum’s maximal extractable value (MEV) — particularly the MEV-Boost software many Ethereum validators use to optimize transactions as searchers seek profitable arbitration opportunities using MEV bots.First, the defendants allegedly established Ethereum validators and concealed their identities through various tactics. After establishing the network, the defendants supposedly created a series of “bait” or test transactions to study MEV bots’ trading activities.Then, after months of planning, the defendants lured victim traders into performing front-run trades, enticing the victims to purchase illiquid cryptocurrencies that were expected to gain value as a result of the transaction.Later, during transaction ordering, the defendants exploited a vulnerability to replace the lured transactions with tampered transactions, thereby blocking the victims’ final sale. The defendants kept the stablecoins and highly liquid cryptocurrencies that the victims originally spent, thereby finalizing the theft.The defendants then allegedly laundered the funds through various methods.Mixed responseThe case is notable as it concerns a new type of crypto crime.US Attorney of the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said the scheme “has never been charged before” and said it “exploit[ed] the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain.”The case has attracted backlash from individuals who consider highly profitable uses of MEV bots, such as the trades that the defendants allegedly blocked, to be an issue in their own right.AllianceDAO Contributor and VoltCapital Venture Partner Mohamed Fouda said:“When an MEV bot uses $25 [million] of stablecoins to sandwich 8 different transactions of illiquid coins, that is a [completely] honest business. …If you bait this MEV bot, then that’s a crime.”Fouda also asserted that the case improperly portrays the duties of Ethereum relayers. He called it a “trap to pull every operator on Ethereum into a web of legal compliance requirements.”Ryan Sean Adams of Bankless likewise dismissed the distinction between transactions, rhetorically asking:“What’s legal MEV, and what’s illegal MEV that gets you 20 years in jail?”Other commentators opposed the alleged theft. Head of Commercial at Brainbot Loring Harkness said:“Stealing from thieves is still theft.”CEHV partner Adam Cochran called the case a “much more clear case of exploit” than widely reported.Metamask Lead Product Manager/Owner Taylor Monahan said:“Yes, if you steal and launder $25 million dollars you should expect to go to prison for a long time … “The DOJ has yet to prove its case in court.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

FTX repayments could create ‘bullish overhang’ for crypto markets - K33 Research

Slated cash repayments to FTX creditors could create a wave of bullish “buying pressure” in the crypto market, says K33 Research analysts.FTX is set to pay a minimum of $14.5 billion in cash to users who lost funds in the exchange’s bankruptcy. These payouts would likely create a “bullish overhang” for the market, K33 analysts Vetle Lunde and Anders Hesleth said in a May 14 report.“Not all creditor repayments are bearish,” said the analysts, contrasting FTX’s expected cash repayments with the planned crypto-based repayments from Mt. Gox and Gemini — the latter two combined “currently valued at $10.6 billion.” The buying pressure from cash recipients would neutralize the selling pressure from in-kind recipients, Lunde and Hesleth concluded.Not all creditor repayments are bearish. Source: K33 ResearchNoting that it would be “impossible” to determine the net buying or selling pressure from these repayments ahead of time, the analysts said the timing of the payments could form a key element in predicting their impact on the market. Related: Post-FTX crypto industry needs education before regulationGemini’s $1.7 billion in repayments is slated for early June, while Mt. Gox’s $8.9 billion is expected to be repaid by its October 2024 deadline. The analysts noted that there was still some uncertainty around the scheduled repayment date due to the court not yet approving the FTX repayment proposal, but said that most FTX creditors were expecting repayments to be issued later this year. “The different timing of these repayments represents yet another indication of a slow summer in the market and a solid end to the year.” On May 8, FTX said it could repay creditors as much as $16.3 billion with those holding claim amounts below $50,000 being eligible for up to 118% of the recovery — using the price of their crypto in November 2022. Some industry pundits expressed dissatisfaction with the proposal, saying that not all creditors would be receiving repayments equivalent to current market prices. “I understand why the bankruptcy process needs to work this way but let’s not pretend victims are getting their money back,” wrote BitGo CEO Mike Belshe in a May 8 post to X.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

NFT Recession: 95% of Assets Drop to Zero Market Value, Report - DailyCoin


        

The NFT market has hit a recession. 



A recent report reveals harrowing details about the NFT market’s decline since 2021.



Despite a significant slowdown in market growth, a glimmer of hope remains. 




In 2021, NFTs stormed into the crypto industry like a hurricane, transforming into a goldmine for almost everyone who touched it. Minting overnight millionaires with what many called ‘on-chain jpegs, ‘ the speculative frenzy led most to anticipate the asset class exploding much like memecoins today, resulting in its market swelling to billions– but not for long. 



After weathering a tumultuous two-year bear market and with the dust settled, a sobering realization emerges: people are losing interest in NFTs. 



NFT Markets Hits Recession. 



Today’s NFT market starkly contrasts with the feverish frenzy in 2021, as investors and traders now exit the once-booming ecosystem amidst declining sales and waning interest. In a report shared with DailyCoin, Invezz reveals that while the global market cap of NFTs has soared past $190 billion, the industry is traversing a harrowing path. 




After analyzing over 73,000 NFT collections with a combined trading volume of $17 billion, the report reveals a staggering reality: 95% of all NFT projects, totaling over 69,000 collections, held zero market value at press time. 



The decline can be attributed to the NFT market’s dwindling trading volume, which has plummeted 97% since its peak in 2021. Adding to the gloom, the once-thriving market, renowned for generating millions per sale through collections like CryptoPunk and Bored Ape Yacht Club, now struggles to generate even hundreds. 



According to the report, 53.6% of NFT sales were valued at less than $200, while 75% were worth less than $100. The daily number of sales also paints a similarly bleak picture, nosediving from an average of 87,000 in 2021 to around 2000 in 2024. 




Offering a sobering perspective, the market recorded only $11.6 million in sales in Q1 2024, a far cry from the industry’s erstwhile billion-dollar hauls per quarter in 2021. It’s evident that one of the crypto industry’s most lucrative and celebrated sectors now faces a pronounced recession; however, there remains a glimmer of hope for a potential comeback. 



There’s Hope For The NFT Market



The crypto market has been through the wringer, emerging from an enduring bear market worsened by international conflicts and contagion events like the FTX fiasco. Lingering scars from the past two years have yet to heal. 



While the industry has garnered significant favor and attention from institutions, leading to its historic run earlier this year, global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties continue to cast a shadow over investor confidence. 



Many find themselves on the edge of their seats, analyzing each candle, anxiously awaiting the official start of the bull market signaled by the US’ first rate cut in two years. 



While some investors have already plunged into memecoins, reaping astronomical gains amidst the frenzy, the NFT market lies dormant, poised for resurgence once market conditions stabilize.



NFTs are inherently speculative and entail considerable risk. Given the market’s tumultuous performance over the past two years, it’s not an appealing investment choice. However, the market could regain its lost valor once retail investors reenter the fray and reallocate funds from low-risk to high-risk assets. 



On the Flipside




Nascent, overhyped sectors like the NFT industry always face a sharp correction before they resurge. 



While US regulators intensify their campaign against the crypto industry, the NFT industry remains immune to ambiguity. Stakeholders argue that NFT-specific legislation could hinder its growth. 




Why This Matters



The NFT industry is one of the greatest subsectors of the crypto sphere. Its slow decline amidst waning interest and sales is concerning, especially for those who hold NFTs.

Solana’s Cypher Protocol Dev Confesses Stealing $300K


								The Solana-based Cypher Protocol is again in the negative spotlight after one of its core developers admitted to stealing and losing over $300,000 of users’ funds. Another of the project’s developers first unveiled the news and also alerted law enforcement.

Solana-Based Protocol Faces Inside Job
On Monday, Cobra, one of Cypher Protocol’s developers, revealed that a core contributor had stolen funds from the Cypher Redemption Package Contract. The developer, Hoak, had withdrawn funds from the contract for several months unnoticed.
The heist was only caught after a user in the project’s Discord pinged the team about having issues withdrawing funds. Per the post, Hoak claimed he would handle the issue. However, the user contacted the team after the developer’s deadline, stating that the issue persisted.
Consequently, the team investigated the issue and found that, in the last six months, Hoak had taken over $300,000 from the contract via 36 transactions.
During this time, the developer used the deployer wallet to withdraw assets such as Ethereum (ETH), Bonk (BONK), Orca (ORCA), Wrapped SOL (WSOL), Tether (USDT), USDC (USDC), among others.
Per the investigation, Hoak swapped the assets for Solana (SOL), USDT, and USDC before sending the funds to an intermediary wallet. The funds were sent to Binance from this wallet. The developer stole 2,498.8 USDT, 51,785.2 USDC, and 1,830.8 SOL, accounting for approximately $317,000.

Summary of the stolen assets. Source: Cobra
Cobra expressed his disbelief and sadness regarding the situation, stating that he didn’t think it was possible a core contributor, who stayed after last year’s exploit to rebuild the project, could “be the one who rugged funds from the redemption contract.”
As reported by Bitcoinist, the Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol was the victim of a security breach that took $1.03 million from the project. Despite the exploit being a major hit to the protocol, the team was able to freeze over half the stolen funds and offer a redemption plan.
The Redemption Package was based on the “socializing losses” mechanism, which consists of distributing the effects of an unfortunate event, like an exploit, across all users. Users would receive a portion of the remaining assets corresponding to their share or involvement in the protocol.
Developer Gambles Funds Away
On Tuesday, Hoak made a public statement admitting to the allegations against him and apologizing. In the statement, the developer claims to suffer from a crippling gambling addiction which has affected his professional life in several instances.
He explained that the untreated addiction drove him to steal the funds from the Redemption Package. However, he claims not to have run away with the Solana-based protocol funds but instead gambled them away, suggesting there’s little hope of retrieving the misappropriated assets.

He closed his statement by apologizing for his actions and stating, “Whatever comes next is in God’s hands.”
The community had mixed reactions to Hoak’s confession. Some members felt sympathetic towards the developer, as Ludomania is a serious matter that should be treated like any other addiction.
However, others felt that Hoak was “playing the victim” and using gambling as an excuse. Similarly, some considered that even if the reason was the one stated, users remained affected by his actions.
Problem gambling with cryptocurrencies is not a new issue in the community, as a user pointed out. A 2023 YouGov survey revealed that people in the UK “are experiencing harm from investing in cryptocurrencies and other high-risk trading products, experiencing similar difficulties that people report with gambling harms.”
It’s worth noting that cryptocurrencies are not related to or a cause of gambling addictions, but, as the UK’s Gambling Commission stated, “consumers who have a propensity to risk do perceive investing in these products as gambling.”

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin’s price surged by 7.50% to $66,350 amid the latest U.S. inflation data release. The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in April, down from 0.4% in March and February. This lower-than-expected increase suggests inflation is resuming its downward trend, bolstering financial market expectations for a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September.CPI Data and Its Economic Implications
The CPI data is significant as it indicates cooling inflation, which is a positive signal for the economy. The slower increase in consumer prices aligns with other data showing retail sales were flat in April, further suggesting a slowdown in domestic demand. This cooling demand is welcome news for Federal Reserve officials aiming to achieve a “soft landing” for the economy without triggering a recession.Key Inflation Drivers: Shelter and Gasoline CostsShelter costs, including rents, increased by 0.4% for the third consecutive month, and gasoline prices jumped by 2.8%. These two categories accounted for over 70% of the CPI increase. In contrast, food prices remained unchanged, with notable decreases in supermarket prices for items like eggs, which dropped by 7.3%.Year-over-year, the CPI increased by 3.4% in April, down slightly from 3.5% in March. This annual increase has slowed significantly from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Economists had forecast the CPI to rise by 0.4% on the month and 3.4% year-over-year, indicating that inflation is moderating.Dovish FOMC Stance Weakens DXY; Driving Bitcoin Price UpFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that although inflation is going down slowly, he expects it to continue moving downward towards the Fed’s 2% target. Financial markets now see a roughly 73% probability of a rate cut in September, up from 69% before the data release. Some economists even anticipate that the Fed may start lowering borrowing costs as early as July.The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate in the 5.25%–5.50% range since July, following a series of rate hikes totaling 525 basis points since March 2022. The expectation of a rate cut has positively impacted stock markets, with Wall Street trading higher, the dollar weakening against other currencies, and U.S. Treasury prices rising. This economic environment has fueled Bitcoin’s price rally as investors seek alternative assets amidst changing monetary policies.Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin is currently trading at $66,350, up 7.50%, according to a bullish Bitcoin price prediction. The 4-hour chart shows a strong bullish rally, with Bitcoin breaking out of a symmetrical triangle pattern around the $63,300 level.This breakout is confirmed by two significant bullish engulfing candles, indicating robust upward momentum.However, caution is warranted as recent candlestick formations, including Doji and spinning tops around the $66,200 level, suggest potential market indecision. These patterns, coupled with an overbought RSI of 78, could signal a forthcoming bearish correction.Bitcoin Price: Key Trading LevelsKey price levels to watch include the pivot point at $65,150, which serves as a crucial support level. Immediate resistance is found at $67,300, with further resistance at $68,545 and $70,000.On the downside, immediate support is at $63,300, followed by $61,560 and $60,185. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $62,565 also provides critical support, reinforcing the bullish trend.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewIf Bitcoin fails to sustain its upward trajectory, a pullback to the pivot point at $65,150 is likely, with further declines potentially reaching $63,300. The RSI being overbought suggests that a bearish correction may be imminent.Conclusion: The overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish above the $65,150 pivot point. However, a break below this level could trigger a sharp selling trend, targeting immediate support at $63,300.As Bitcoin experiences significant market movements, let’s dive into an exciting new opportunity in the crypto world.Sealana Presale

IOTA Launches New Testnet "IOTA 2.0" and Introduces PoS


Internet of Things blockchain ecosystem IOTA announced the launch of its “IOTA 2.0” testnet, which will improve the scalability and security of its ecosystem. 
IOTA’s new public testnet promises to be environmentally friendly by reducing its environmental impact and energy consumption. In doing so, it aims to attract companies focused on “green solutions.”
IOTA Launches New Testnet “IOTA 2.0”

IOTA announced that “IOTA 2” will enable the migration from Proof of Work (PoW) to a decentralized Proof of Stake (PoS), which will result in increased network scalability and efficiency.
The new testnet eliminated the central entity that previously managed consensus in the network and will now seek to combat the influence of “centralized figures” in the network. IOTA even promises to explore new concepts of efficiency and “genuine decentralization.”

“The new consensus mechanism is designed to improve the security of the network, making it more resistant to attacks and failures. This is crucial to gaining trust and expanding adoption in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and smart cities, where security is paramount,” IOTA said in a statement.

IOTA clarifies that its new restnet is a testbed for developers with no real-world value. It also clarifies that the 2.0 network could be subject to occasional reboots but with a “grace period.”
On social media, developers said the new IOTA testnet marks a milestone because it represents new opportunities for the decentralized finance ecosystem. Others said it has the potential to challenge Ethereum and achieve a market capitalization of $1 billion.

Some developers even commented that IOTA would come very close to solving the blockchain trilemma of scalability, decentralization, and security. Others predicted greater efficiency from the new testnet, as “you don’t do block after block after block.”

                        In a landmark case that has to be the first of its kind, two brothers, both graduates of the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), have been apprehended and charged with exploiting a vulnerability in the Ethereum blockchain. Their alleged actions resulted in a massive $25 million theft in 12 seconds. Anton Peraire-Bueno, 24, and James Peraire-Bueno, 28, face fraud and money laundering charges. A Well-Planned Exploit Of the Ethereum Blockchain By the Two BrothersFederal prosecutors in Manhattan filed the charges, describing the scheme as meticulously planned and executed with the precision of a high-stakes digital heist. “The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialized skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of Ethereum users across the globe,” said Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.The Peraire-Bueno brothers were arrested on Tuesday, with Anton being taken into custody in Boston and James in New York. They are expected to appear in federal court on Wednesday afternoon. The brothers’ lawyers have not yet commented on the charges.According to the US Justice Department, the brothers set up validators on the Ethereum network, which are intended to help order transactions and facilitate profitable trades through bots. However, they allegedly used their validators to deceive traders and secure access to pending transactions. This manipulation allowed them to alter the flow of electronic currency, effectively stealing the crypto. They then moved the stolen funds through complex transactions to obscure their origins.Over several months, the brothers meticulously planned their operation. They studied the trading patterns of Ethereum bots and established shell companies and identified cryptocurrency exchanges with lax ‘know your customer’ (KYC) procedures to launder their illicit gains. Their thoroughness even extended to researching extradition procedures, highlighting the depth of their preparation.Stolen Funds Going Up This Year
The heist is only the tip of the iceberg of ill-gotten crypto in recent years. United Nations sanctions monitors recently reported that North Korea laundered $147.5 million in stolen cryptocurrency through the Tornado Cash platform in March alone. A confidential document submitted to the U.N. Security Council sanctions committee revealed that North Korean suspects have been linked to 97 cyberattacks on crypto firms over the past seven years, amounting to approximately $3.6 billion. According to PeckShield, approximately $100 million of stolen cryptocurrency funds were successfully recovered in March, representing 52.8% of the total hacked amount. Despite initial losses of $187.29 million across over 30 hacking incidents, the Munchables incident was particularly notable. Following negotiations, the hacker returned the stolen funds, significantly contributing to the recovered amount. Meanwhile, a recent $71 million wallet impersonation scam resulted in an investor transferring 97% of their assets to a bait wallet address. The hacker swiftly converted the stolen Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) into approximately 23,000 ETH and began distributing the funds across multiple wallets after six days. In the first quarter of 2024, total losses from hacking and fraudulent activities reached approximately $336.3 million, down from $437.5 million in the same period in 2023. The quarter saw 46 hacking incidents and 15 cases of fraudulent activities. Ethereum was the most targeted blockchain, followed by the BNB Chain, with both networks accounting for 73% of the total losses. Major incidents included the $81.7 million exploit on Orbit Bridge and the $62 million Munchables hack, with a notable recovery of $73.9 million (22%) from seven exploits. Hacking incidents accounted for 95.6% of the losses, while scams and rug pulls comprised 4.4%.

FTX Customers Express Frustration Despite 118% Payouts In Bankruptcy Case-Here's Why | Bitcoinist.com


								Customers of the defunct FTX crypto exchange find themselves at the center of a complex bankruptcy case with potentially promising outcomes. 
While the process has been far from smooth, the recent surge in the crypto market has bolstered the value of FTX’s assets, resulting in the possibility of customers receiving payouts that exceed their initial investments. Still, there’s a catch for customers who have ignited discontent despite the exchange’s announcement of a full refund.
FTX Customers On The Brink Of Recovery
Following FTX’s downfall, affected customers, such as Arush Sehgal and Acaena Amoros Romero, saw their life savings vanish into the void. However, the subsequent rally in the crypto market, with FTX’s asset liquidation efforts and the discovery of scattered cash and crypto holdings, has transformed the bleak prospects into a potential success story. 
FTX’s newly appointed managers, led by Jonh Ray III, have found assets, including selling stakes in companies such as artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic, to make up for losses caused by the mismanagement of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund.

As previously reported, FTX expects to amass a substantial sum, potentially reaching $16.3 billion, after selling off assets. This exceeds the approximately $11 billion owed to customers and other private creditors, leaving most of them in line to receive 118% of their original FTX account value. 
However, government regulators are expected to receive only a fraction of their claims, while shareholders are likely to face complete wipeout, as is standard in bankruptcy proceedings.
The development has drawn attention as payouts surpass outcomes of other bankruptcies within the crypto space and beyond. Typically, creditors receive only a fraction of what they are owed, but FTX’s case is shaping to be an exception. The anticipated payouts, which constitute an unusually swift turnaround, are expected to commence later this year.
Frustrated Customers Rally Against Bankruptcy Plan
Yet, despite the positive outlook, some FTX customers remain dissatisfied with the proposed plan. According to Bloomberg, over 80 individuals have voiced their concerns in letters to the bankruptcy court, criticizing decisions made by FTX CEO John Ray, including the valuation of their accounts. 
Former creditor committee member Arush Sehgal has received support from approximately 1,500 individuals who share similar views, leading to the establishment of FTXvote—an initiative aimed at rallying opposition to the plan.
“A hundred cents on the dollar doesn’t mean much to me,” said Sehgal, a vocal critic of how restructuring advisors have handled the case. Sehgal and Romero say they stand to recoup about $1 million, a quarter of what their account would be worth. 

Nonetheless, the case’s ultimate resolution will depend on the upcoming vote by FTX account holders and US bankruptcy judge John Dorsey’s consideration of creditor comments.
Notwithstanding the discontent among certain customers, the bankruptcy process signifies a significant milestone in terms of the potential recovery for customers, even if not all expectations are met. 
Veno Bojanovsky, an affected customer, expressed skepticism about the outcome but chose to retain his claim rather than sell it off.

SEC custody rule made crypto regulation a ‘political football’ - Rep. Nickel

The United States securities regulator has turned crypto regulation into a “political football,” and its “open hostility” isn’t helping President Joe Biden, says Representative Wiley Nickel.In a May 15 letter to Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, Nickel, a Democrat, claimed the regulator ran contrary to its mission to protect investors and breached its authority in trying to pass the controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, or SAB 121.SAB 121 is a proposed rule mandating that SEC-reporting entities custodying crypto must record those holdings as liabilities on their balance sheets.Nickel claims it would prevent American banks from being able to custody crypto exchange-traded products at scale — which creates a “concentration risk” by handing more control over to non-bank entities, The SEC’s “open hostility” toward the cryptocurrency industry “isn’t serving President Biden’s best interests,” he added.“The SEC is turning cryptocurrency regulation into a political football and forcing President Biden to choose sides on an issue that matters to many Americans,” the North Carolina Representative wrote.Source: Wiley NickelNickel wants Gensler to withdraw SAB 121 but he is confident the Senate in its May 16 vote on the matter will pass a resolution invalidating the SEC’s proposed rule.“I’m hopeful that this bipartisan, bicameral resolution will send a message: it’s time to adjust the SEC’s misguided approach to digital assets.”The House of Representatives voted to pass a bill overturning SAB 121 last week. The last stop for the bill before it could overturn the rule would be on Biden's desk — who has said he would veto the bill should it make it that far.Related: SEC’s Gary Gensler gets irked being asked about cryptoNickel is worried that SAB 121 could result in many U.S. investors seeking offshore custody solutions which could prove “riskier” in the long run.Many Republicans share his position, too, including U.S. Representative Tom Emmer, who said SAB 121 would make U.S. markets “less fair, less orderly and less efficient.”

                        Two South Korean police officers are standing trial over alleged bribery in an increasingly high-profile crypto fraud case.The newspaper Namdo Ilbo reported that on May 14, the Gwangju District Court’s Criminal Division began the trial of a 59-year-old superintendent police officer.The officer is named in reports as “A” for legal reasons. The court is also trying a 57-year-old police lieutenant (“B”) from the same station.
Crypto Fraud Case: South Korean Police Officers Implicated
The case centers around an alleged crypto fraudster surnamed Tak. The latter is accused of orchestrating an art-themed altcoin scam.Police think Tak duped several crypto-keen victims out of about $2.1 million worth of fiat and crypto.They have accused Tak of running a fake Ethereum (ETH) and NFT-related project.Officers think Tak convinced several citizens to invest in a bogus crypto-related company.When police and prosecution officials began investigating Tak, the latter hired a legal “broker” surnamed Seong (aged 62).Mobile police barriers on a South Korean street.Broker Paid Cash Bribes, Prosecutors Claim
Prosecutors told the court that Seong paid the superintendent over $7,300 in cash bribes “on two occasions” to promote B to a higher rank.The court heard that Seong met the superintendent police officer twice at restaurants on February 4 and 15.Both officers have been suspended from their posts for the duration of the trials.B first appeared in court on separate bribery charges, also related to the same case, in January this year.Seong appears to have created and fostered a network of contacts in the local police force, as well as the Gwangju and Mokpo prosecution services.The Mokpo Bridge in Mokpo, South Korea. (Source: Glabb [CC BY-SA 3.0])Tak has confessed to giving Seong money to bribe prosecution officials and police officers to help clear the name of the alleged crypto fraudster.But the plan appears to have unraveled fast. Last month, a Mokpo prosecutor was jailed for a year for accepting a bribe from Seong.The same court found the prosecution official guilty of taking money and favors in exchange for disclosing sensitive information about the case.
Crypto Fraud ‘Bribes’ Case: 18 More People Implicated
Seong has made a statement confessing to putting envelopes full of cash into both police officers’ “coat pockets” as these were hanging on pegs in the restaurant.A’s legal team disputed the allegations. It asked why Seong would make the promotion request in February, the month after the police force typically finalizes its list of promotion candidates.The legal team challenged the accuracy of the account during a witness cross-examination.The defense lawyers also asked Seong if he had explicitly asked the superintendent to promote his subordinate when handing over the alleged bribes.To this, Seong reportedly told the court that he “didn’t remember” much about the events of February 2022.He claimed that he was “in such a hurry” at the time that his recollections had become unclear.The court will reconvene on June 11. But more officers are set to face trial in the weeks and months ahead.The media outlet explained that the prosecution has indicted 18 people in connection with the case.This list “includes former and current prosecutors and police officials,” as well as “another broker,” Namdo Ilbo wrote.

Worldcoin’s Privacy Pivot: Iris Codes Deleted As Part Of Major Security Upgrade


								The Worldcoin Foundation has released a new open-source system to safeguard sensitive information more effectively.
This system, now accessible in a GitHub repository, allows any organization to adopt these advanced data protection measures.
The foundation highlighted that this initiative aims to establish a “new benchmark” in data security, particularly for biometric data.
The transition to this innovative system has led the Worldcoin Foundation to delete the iris codes previously collected during user registration.

Notably, participants in the Worldcoin project initially had their eyeballs scanned by specialized Orb devices to verify their identity and receive WLD tokens, the project’s cryptocurrency. This process was part of the foundation’s effort to create a unique digital identification for each user.
Secure Multi-Party Computation And User Privacy
The foundation’s new system is based on secure multi-party computation (SMPC), a subset of cryptography that enhances data protection by distributing a single secret across multiple parties.
This method increases the security of stored information by ensuring that the complete data set is never held in a single location, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches.
The Worldcoin Foundation, in collaboration with technologists from TACEO and Tools for Humanity, has developed a new implementation of SMPC that addresses previous limitations related to scale and cost.
This development is particularly pertinent as the requirement for individuals to provide biometric data to various organizations becomes more common. The Worldcoin Foundation stressed the growing need to protect users’ data securely against potential threats and misuse.
Meanwhile, prior to this development, Worldcoin was scrutinized by regulatory bodies across several nations, particularly due to concerns over its data collection practices.
For instance, Hong Kong’s Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data took investigative actions against the project earlier in the year, citing privacy concerns. This backdrop makes the foundation’s move to delete iris codes and enhance privacy measures even more noteworthy.
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has previously praised Worldcoin’s efforts to improve privacy. He lauded the project’s “data-minimal” approach and its ability to surpass traditional, centralized authentication solutions in safeguarding user privacy.
Looking Ahead: Worldcoin’s Strategic Expansion
Worldcoin is also preparing for the launch of World Chain, an open-source Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, set to debut in mid-2024. This platform aims to “revolutionize” human authentication by integrating with the Worldcoin protocol and providing a dedicated infrastructure to transition from existing networks.
The protocol has demonstrated significant adoption, with over 5 million people from 160 countries registered and 49 million transactions through verified wallets.
The upcoming World Chain seeks to enhance scalability, support a growing user base, and foster a stronger ecosystem for the project.
This effort includes addressing the challenges posed by automated transactions, which constitute approximately 80% of all blockchain activity and often lead to network congestion.
According to the report, the Worldcoin team is also trying to safely increase the L2 block gas limit, supported by research into performance scenarios to ensure a secure and inclusive ecosystem.

Bitcoin crosses $66K as traders eye 2 key indicators for $70K target

Bitcoin (BTC) jumped 7.54% in the past 24 hours and pushed past $65,000 amid positive United States inflation data with traders now keeping an eye on two key indicators for a potential rise to $70,000.Pseudonymous crypto trader Blockchain Mane told Cointelegraph they are closely observing the Gann Fans model — a key indicator which analyzes the geometric and cyclical movement of the crypto market — to see if Bitcoin can “remain bullish.”“Gann Fans are interesting, almost like a time and price momentum indicator,” they said, explaining it helps to better visualize the market cycles and price action.The Gann square consists of a 5x5 grid, column 1 is the start of the cycle. Source: Blockchain Mane“In terms of Gan timing, we are at a pivot in the market cycle, directly in the center of the current square. if we pivot to the upside, then we can see a markup phase until the end of May,” they explained.However, they warned, “if we lose this break then we will probably see the sideways, downtrend continuation until the end of May.”The pattern has stood out to the Blockchain Mane on the same day that core inflation fell to its lowest levels since 2021, at just 3.6% — potentially strengthening the case for interest rate cuts.Blockchain Mane is now looking for Bitcoin to flip its “previous resistance” price level of $63,000 to become its new support level, claiming this will be a “bullish indicator.”Bitcoin is currently trading at $66,085. Source: CoinMarketCapThey would rather see “sideway price action” here while more narratives build up, otherwise, they claim it may hinder the potential for altcoins to gain.“If BTC pumps here and gets rejected, Alts will probably get hammered as Bitcoin’s dominance continues to rise, Alts are becoming more and more glued to BTC price action.”Bitcoin’s dominance — the ratio of Bitcoin’s market cap compared to the total market cap of all other cryptocurrencies — has risen 2.23% to 55.99% over the past seven days, according to TradingView data.Related: Bitcoin selling pressure to ease? M2 money supply flips positiveMeanwhile, the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern — a bullish indicator signaling the downtrend is easing and buyers are gaining market dominance — is one of the indicators showing that Bitcoin is due “for a bounce,” pseudonymous crypto trader Milkybull Crypto told his X followers on May 15.Source: Milkybull CryptoThe inverse head-and-shoulders pattern forms as a reversal setup and includes an “inverted” head and shoulders, with the left and right shoulders upside down below the neckline. If the pattern continues, Bitcoin’s price could reach its next key price level of $70,000 before potentially breaking its current all-time high price of $74,580, according to Milkybull Crypto.This represents an approximate 12% jump from its current price of $66,085, according to CoinMarketCap data.Magazine: UK cannabis millionaire’s legal ‘deals on wheels’ via cryptoThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Bitcoin ETF 13F filings 'just a down payment' on BTC: Exec - AMBCrypto



So far, professional investment firms own about $3 billion of BTC ETFs.
Bitwise exec term $3B as a ‘down payment’ as allocation will increase in 6 months. 

Despite the discouraging market choppiness, Bitcoin’s [BTC] future seems bright and full of unimaginable potential. 
According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, flows to BTC ETFs could surge as large firms increase their allocation in the next six months. 
Hougan maintained an uber-bullish stance on BTC’s future after many confirmed professional firms held BTC ETFs after recent 13F filings. 
“I find the 13F filings for Bitcoin ETFs extraordinarily bullish for the long-term future of Bitcoin.” 
It has been challenging to know the buyers or sellers of spot BTC ETFs that debuted in January. However, the 13F filings have solved the problem. 
The 13F filings, filed every quarter, are one of the SEC’s requirements for investors holding more than $100 million in AUM (assets under management) to report their holdings publicly. 
For instance, the Boston-based Bracebridge Capital reportedly bought $262 million of Fidelity’s BTC ETF (ARKB) based on the filings. 
Why the 13F filings are a bullish case for Bitcoin
Since their January debut, the spot BTC ETFs have seen $11.8 billion in cumulative net flow and over $50 billion in net assets, per SoSo Value data. 
Based on recent 13F filings as of last Thursday, professional investment firms owned $3.5 billion of spot BTC ETFs, per Bitwise exec. 
Part of Bitwise CIO statement on the filing read, 
“All told, 563 professional investment firms reported owning $3.5 billion worth of bitcoin ETFs as of last Thursday. By the time the May 15 filing deadline arrives, I suspect we may end up with 700+ professional firms and total AUM approaching $5 billion.” 
Bloomberg ETF analyst called the above huge number of BTC large-scale investors ‘bonkers.’
“What is also notable IMO is the sheer number of holders that each has so far.. $IBIT is up to 250. That’s bonkers for the first quarter on mkt.”
According to Huogan, the large-scale professional investment firms holding BTC ETFs were comparable to none, except the gold ETFs in late 2004. 
However, retail investors owned more BTC ETFs than large-scale firms. Hougan noted that the investment firms owned about $3-$5 billion of BTC ETFs, about 7-10% of the ETF’s  $50 billion in total assets. 
But Hougan argued that professional investors could soon eclipse retail investors. Hougan noted that professional investors are testing out things before exposing their clients. 
According to the Bitwise exec, the next step will involve professional investors allocating for a ‘few clients’ before going to a platform-wide allocation ranging from ‘1-5% of the portfolio’ in the next six months. 
It meant the amount declared in the 13F filings could increase in the next six months, making the current declarations a ‘down payment.’
‘This tells me that the allocations we see in recent 13F filings are just a down payment.’
If Hougan’s outline comes true for professional investment firms, we could see an increase in flows from large firms in the second half of 2024. This could potentially bolster BTC prices over the same period.

Vanguard’s new boss says Bitcoin ETF not on the table: Report

The new chief executive of United States investment giant Vanguard has said he won’t reverse the company’s decision to not launch a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund.Vanguard’s new CEO, Salim Ramji — the former head of BlackRock’s global ETF business — told Barron’s in an interview published May 15 that Vanguard stands for consistency and crypto-related investment products do not align with its “investment philosophy.” “I think it’s important for firms to have consistency in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer,” said Ramji. “I have heard [chief investment officer] Greg Davis’ explanation and I think it is entirely consistent with Vanguard’s investment philosophy. It is a logical and consistent point of view.”Ramji oversaw the launch of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF in January, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has amassed $18 billion in assets under management.He has openly expressed his interest in crypto and his move to Vanguard had industry watchers speculating on what changes he would make at the firm.Salim Ramji. Source: VanguardAlongside BlackRock’s ETF launch, its rivals including Fidelity and nine other investment managers also launched spot Bitcoin funds which have together seen over $12 billion in net inflows.Vanguard, with its $8.6 trillion in AUM, opted for a different approach and didn’t launch a Bitcoin ETF — viewing crypto as a speculative investment and an immature asset class.Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in a May 15 X post he doesn’t believe Ramji would usher in a Vanguard spot Bitcoin ETF.Seyffart said, however, that Ramji might reverse the firm’s position to not allow its clients to buy other spot Bitcoin ETFs on its brokerage platform.Vanguard’s outgoing CEO, Tim Buckley, said in March that he didn’t believe a Bitcoin ETF belongs in a long-term portfolio of someone saving for their retirement as it’s a speculative asset.His comments followed pressure from customers after the launch of the Bitcoin ETFs from rival firms.Related: JPMorgan reports holding shares of several spot Bitcoin ETFsIn January, a number of Vanguard clients threatened to close their accounts over the firm blocking access to spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Ethereum Price Recovery Trails Behind Bitcoin's Surge in Crypto Rebound


																Ethereum price recovered above the $2,920 resistance. ETH is trailing Bitcoin and might struggle to continue higher above the $3,050 resistance.

Ethereum started a recovery wave and even climbed above $3,000.
The price is trading above $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).
The pair could now struggle to clear the $3,040 and $3,050 resistance levels.

Ethereum Price Recovers Nearly 5%
Ethereum price remained stable above the $2,860 support zone and started a fresh increase. ETH gained nearly 5% but less than Bitcoin. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.
The bulls pumped the price above the $2,950 and $3,000 levels. A new weekly high was formed at $3,039 and the price is now consolidating gains. It tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $2,860 swing low to the $3,039 high.
Ethereum is still well above $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $3,040 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,050 level.

An upside break above the $3,050 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance sits at $3,150, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,220 level. If there is a clear move above the $3,220 level, the price might rise and test the $3,350 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,500 resistance zone.
Are Dips Supported In ETH?
If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,050 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,000 level. The first major support is near the $2,950 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $2,860 swing low to the $3,039 high.
The next support is near the $2,930 level. A clear move below the $2,930 support might push the price toward $2,900. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,860 level in the near term.
Technical Indicators

Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL) to Skyrocket 13,000% as BitMart Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because DOGESOL has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on BitMart.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Baby Doge on Sol can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Baby Doge on Sol could become the next viral memecoin.



Baby Doge on Sol launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Baby Doge on Sol on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the BitMart listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Baby Doge on Sol by entering its contract address – G5GEMyeea1HqS2KnpazPiMuTy3sqS1UdQegsbNLGpF7U – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGESOL.

Boothbay Bitcoin ETF Investment Now Accounts For The Largest Proportion Of IBIT With $150M - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Boothbay Fund Management disclosed $5.2 billion in Bitcoin ETF holdings, becoming the largest shareholder in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF.



Boothbay Bitcoin ETF investments include $149.8 million in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, $105.5 million in Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF, and $69.5 million in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.



Boothbay’s significant cryptocurrency investments highlight growing institutional adoption and positive market sentiment.




In a recent SEC filing, Boothbay Fund Management, one of the largest US-based fund companies, disclosed substantial investments in several Bitcoin ETFs, emphasizing the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency assets.





Boothbay Bitcoin ETF Investment Overweights BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale Bitcoin ETFs



The 13F form, a quarterly requirement for large investment firms to ensure transparency in financial markets, revealed Boothbay’s significant positions in BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Bitwise Bitcoin ETFs.



Boothbay Bitcoin ETF investment amounts to a staggering $5.2 billion. The firm holds 3,701,600 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF, valued at approximately $149.8 million, making it the largest shareholder in this ETF. Additionally, Boothbay owns 1.7 million shares of Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF, worth about $105.5 million, also positioning it as the top holder.



The firm’s other notable holdings include $69.5 million in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and over $52 million in Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, further solidifying Boothbay’s dominant presence in the Bitcoin ETF market.  Beyond Boothbay Bitcoin ETF investment, the company’s portfolio encompasses diverse ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF. 




Institutional Adoption Drives Positive Market Sentiment



The disclosed positions reflect only a portion of Boothbay’s total Assets Under Management (AUM), indicating that the firm’s actual investments are even more extensive. The detailed SEC filings also revealed Boothbay’s trading activity in shares of companies like Coinbase, MicroStrategy, and Robinhood Markets, illustrating a broader engagement with the cryptocurrency sector.



This substantial investment in Bitcoin ETFs by Boothbay and other major hedge funds underscores a growing trend of institutional adoption of digital assets, contributing to positive market sentiment. The influx of capital into these ETFs is expected to continue driving market momentum in the coming weeks. As Coincu reported, the Wisconsin Investment Council, Bank of Montreal and JPMorgan also recently revealed their Bitcoin ETF investments.

Major institutions like the State of Wisconsin Investment Board and JPMorgan Chase have disclosed significant Bitcoin ETF holdings.



Numerous 13F filings reveal increasing investments in Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting their growing acceptance in traditional finance since January 2024.

Surge in Bitcoin ETF Filings Reflects Growing Financial Sector Interest

Other notable firms, such as Morgan Stanley, Aristeia Capital, Boothbay Fund Management, and Bank of Montreal, have similarly disclosed significant investments in these funds.



Throughout 2024, Bitcoin ETFs have increasingly become a focal point within the financial sector, following their initial approvals in January. This wave of institutional interest highlights the growing acceptance and integration of Bitcoin as a key asset in traditional investment strategies. This trend indicates a robust and sustained institutional confidence in the future of Bitcoin as part of mainstream financial portfolios.

Toncoin beats Bitcoin with stunning 160% gain, but there's a catch - AMBCrypto



TON has gained over 160% more than BTC so far.
TON has also seen more activity in some on-chain metrics.

Toncoin [TON] has emerged as the only Layer 1 Network capable of competing effectively with Bitcoin [BTC] since the beginning of the year. 
TON has outpaced BTC by over 160% and boasts a higher number of active addresses. 
Despite these achievements, traders appear to lack confidence in TON, as sentiment surrounding the coin has turned negative.
Toncoin gains more than 100% over Bitcoin
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Bitcoin and Toncoin’s price trends revealed that Toncoin had outpaced BTC in terms of gains. 
TON, starting the year at around $2.3, has experienced substantial uptrends in recent months, reaching approximately $6.8 at the time of writing. 
Utilizing the price range tool, it was evident that TON had surged by over 200% from the year’s beginning to press time. 
Source: TradingView
Conversely, BTC began the year at approximately $44,220 and had risen to around $62,400. This represented a growth of about 42% during the same period.
 Comparing the charts, Toncoin exhibited nearly 160% more growth than BTC.
Source: TradingView
Furthermore, analysis of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated that BTC was below the neutral line at the time of assessment, suggesting a bear trend. 
In contrast, Toncoin’s RSI was above 60, signaling a strong bull trend.
Toncoin sees more active addresses than Bitcoin
Analysis of Toncoin’s active addresses over the last 30 days has revealed a surge in activity, surpassing that of Bitcoin. 
From March onwards, Toncoin’s active addresses began to climb steadily, peaking in May and maintaining this heightened level. 
Starting from around 1,000 active addresses in March, Toncoin has now surpassed 10,000 active addresses, with over 10,800 recorded at the time of writing.
Source: Santiment
In contrast, Bitcoin’s active addresses metric, while having higher overall numbers, has been on a declining trend.
 On the 15th of April, Bitcoin recorded nearly 16 million active addresses, but this number had decreased to around 12.6 million by press time. 
This comparison highlighted that although Bitcoin has a larger number of active addresses overall, Toncoin was experiencing more activity and growth in relative terms.
Bitcoin edges Toncoin in sentiment
AMBCrypto’s look at Bitcoin’s Funding Rate on Coinglass indicated a positive sentiment at press time. 
Despite a slight decline, it remained around 0.0018%, suggesting that buyers continued to dominate the trend.

Conversely, Toncoin’s Funding Rate revealed a negative sentiment. At the time of writing, the Funding Rate was around -0.047%, indicating a prevalence of sellers in the market. 
These metrics reflected a scenario where more participants were betting on an increase in Bitcoin’s price. At the same time, Toncoin had a higher number of traders taking short positions.

Bitcoin Selling On Coinbase Fizzles: Short-Term Jump Soon?


								Data shows that Bitcoin selling pressure on the crypto exchange Coinbase is decreasing, which could be conducive to a short-term bounce.
Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Is Approaching Neutral Mark Again
As analyst Maartunn explained in a post on X, the Coinbase Premium Gap has risen since plunging into negative territory yesterday. The “Coinbase Premium Gap” here refers to a metric that tracks the difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).
When the value of this indicator is positive, it means the cryptocurrency price listed on Coinbase is greater than on Binance right now. Such a trend implies the buying pressure is higher (or the selling pressure is lower) on the former than on the latter.

On the other hand, a negative value would suggest that the selling pressure on Coinbase may be higher than on Binance, as the asset is trading for a lower value on the exchange.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past few weeks:

The value of the metric seems to have been going up over the past day | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has been negative for the past few days, suggesting Coinbase users have been selling more heavily than Binance ones.
Coinbase is popularly known to be the preferred platform for US-based institutional investors, while Binance hosts global traffic. As such, the premium’s value can tell us about the behavior of American whales.
The recent negative values of the indicator would naturally imply that these large entities have been participating in some selling. From the chart, it’s visible that these investors also showed similar behavior earlier.
When the selling finally dropped off, and the Coinbase Premium Gap flipped, the cryptocurrency’s price rebounded in the short term. Over the past day, the indicator has shown a similar trend, as its value has now approached the neutral mark.
This may imply that the institutional traders could be done with their selling for now. “This could potentially create some short-term upside opportunity,” notes the analyst.

In some other news, the Bitcoin Open Interest, a measure of the total amount of derivatives-related positions currently open for the asset, has seen an alarming spike during the last few hours, as Maartunn has pointed out in another X post.

Looks like the value of the indicator has seen a sharp jump recently | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
Generally, an increase in open interest can lead to higher volatility in Bitcoin prices. This 9% rise has come so suddenly, so a violent liquidation event may be coming for the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin has recovered over the past day as its price has now crossed the $64,800 mark.

XRP is eyeing a steady move above the $0.520 level.
The price is now trading above $0.5120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There was a break above a short-term declining channel with resistance at $0.5025 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair could start another increase if there is a close above the $0.520 resistance.

XRP Price Eyes Breakout
Yesterday, we saw how XRP price started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price was able to settle above the $0.4950 and $0.50 resistance levels.
There was a break above a short-term declining channel with resistance at $0.5025 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even cleared the $0.5150 resistance level and settled above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

Immediate resistance is near the $0.5185 level. The first key resistance is near $0.5200. A close above the $0.5200 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.5220. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.5220 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.5350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.550 resistance.
Another Decline?
If XRP fails to clear the $0.520 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5145 level. The next major support is at $0.5120.
If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5120 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could even drop below the $0.5050 support zone or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4980 swing low to the $0.5195 high.
Technical Indicators

Ripple and Evmos to Build XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain


Ripple announced its collaboration with Cosmos’ Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based protocol, Evmos, to build an XRP Ledger EVM sidechain. In this partnership, they will also collaborate with crypto software company Peersyst.
The XRP Ledger (XRPL) sidechain will be built on the evmOS solution, with which they will seek to prioritize native Web3 enterprise applications and their compatibility with EVM.
Ripple and Evmos to Build XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain

evmOS is a modular, production-ready solution that supports EVM and web3 enterprises. It is built with Cosmos SDK, allowing projects to customize their logic and go beyond standard smart contract platforms.
The sidechain will give Web3 companies access to over 60 Cosmos SDK, Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), CometBFT consensus engine strings, and the DApp Store. Building the sidechain also involved interconnecting the user community, DApps, and a network of more than 90 connected chains.
Read more: How To Buy XRP and Everything You Need To Know
XRPL will be connected to the blockchain through IBC. In addition, XRP users can access DApps such as Orbinal Apes, Forge, Osmosis, and Stride, among others.
Now, the XRPL community will have a “passport” to all the chains, while users can browse any application seamlessly. It is important to note that XRPL has a relatively large user base, which is evident from its native token’s, XRP, market capitalization of $27 billion. 

“Bringing the XRPL EVM sidechain to the interchain with evmOS represents a significant milestone in expanding the XRPL ecosystem. By leveraging evmOS technology we can offer developers unparailleled flavibility and customization options, enabling them to build innovative cross-chain applications that tap into the vast potential of the XRPL and the broader interchain ecosystem,” Jasmine Cooper, Head of DeFi Product at Ripple, explained.

Additionally, Evmos pledges $5 million in grant funding to the XRPL blockchain. To this end, it called on developers “who are aligned with Evmos’ values” to join the ecosystem.


“Thanks to Evmos, the XRP Army joins the open, scalable, and interconnected economy of the future: the interchain. Learn more about Ripple x Evmos and how evmOS leverages Interchain Stack components to unlock a modular-interchain EVM solution,” the Cosmos team commented.

Following JPMorgan & Wells Fargo, $12 Billion Boston Hedge Fund Bets Big on Bitcoin with Spot ETF Investment | Cryptoglobe


                                
Bracebridge Capital, a Boston-based hedge fund managing roughly $12 billion in assets, has revealed a significant investment in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) totaling $363 million across three funds.



According to a recent analysis from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, Bracebridge Capital has added exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin via the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC).







Notably, Bracebridge is known for managing endowment funds for prestigious institutions like Yale and Princeton Universities. The move highlights growing institutional interest in Bitcoin after the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, with major financial institutions investing in these.



The disclosure comes amid several others, with the U.S. state of Wisconsin recently becoming the first local government entity to reveal an investment in Bitcoin after purchasing 94,562 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), worth nearly $100 million, in the first quarter of the year.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The move sees the state of Wisconsin join several Wall Street giants, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, in revealing BTC exposure through investment in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to 13F filings.



JPMorgan revealed an investment of $731,246 in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s GBTC, while Wells Fargo disclosed $141,817 in GBTC holdings. BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon have also made similar disclosures.



BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe whose asset management arm has over $600 billion in assets under management, has gained exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin in the first quarter of the year as well by purchasing shares of IBIT.

This Is How Many New Tokens and Meme Coins Have Emerged on Ethereum and Solana Since Apr 1


																Since the beginning of April, more than a million new tokens have been created, with over 370,000 appearing on Ethereum, owing to activity on Coinbase’s Layer 2 network, Base.
Solana leads with the creation of over 640,000 new tokens, primarily meme coins.
Base Sees Increased User Activity
According to the data shared by Coinbase director Conor Grogan, 372,642 new tokens have been launched on the Ethereum network alone since April 1, with 88% of them on Coinbase’s Layer 2 blockchain, Base.
This surge in activity on the Layer 2 network is driven by users flocking to the low-cost platform to create new meme coins. Interestingly, the number of tokens created on Ethereum in this short period is double the total number launched between 2015 and 2023.
Base experienced a revival in user activity this quarter. This is evident in Franklin Templeton’s recent report which highlighted that the blockchain has gained substantial traction from SocialFi applications like Friend.Tech. It found that several leading crypto-based social applications are being built on the Layer 2 network.




In fact, Base processes around 46% of all SocialFi transactions, making this sector vital for the network’s adoption and growth, according to the asset manager’s statistics.
Data from L2BEAT further revealed that Base is currently positioned as the third largest Ethereum Layer 2 network boasting $5.48 billion in total value locked (TVL).
New users on Base have been consistently increasing since the beginning of the year but gained notable traction after March. Dune Analytics’ data indicated that the daily user count on the network increased from 4.6 million in March to 8.9 million in May, reflecting a 92.86% increase in just two months.
Solana’s Meme Coin Explosion
Meme coins made up the majority of the 643,227 new tokens created on Solana during the same period. Some of them that have posted massive gains are dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk (BONK), and Slerf (SLERF), among others.
Besides spot Bitcoin ETF hype, meme coin mania has played a crucial role in the current market cycle. Many industry players have touted this cycle as “bizarre” as a result. However, most of these tokens have since collapsed or become worthless, with meme coin scams rife not just on Solana but also on Base.
Meanwhile, CryptoQuant co-founder Ki Young Ju recently warned against the meme coin hype, asserting that these assets often overshadow the efforts of dedicated teams working on legitimate products that could propel industry progress.

Q1 Bitcoin ETF holders: 1500 institutes reported, Millennium leads with nearly $2 billion in holdings - Crypto Briefing




Yesterday marked the deadline for investment firms managing over $100 million in Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares to disclose their holdings, and the data shows that these newly launched ETF products are attracting significant interest from institutional players.According to combined data from Fintel, over 1500 investment firms disclosed total ownership of around $10.6 billion in these ETFs. Of the ten spot Bitcoin ETFs, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) are the top choices for professional investors.Hedge fund giant Millennium Management leads the pack with $1.97 billion worth of Bitcoin ETF shares, according to a recent 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The fund’s investment portfolio includes $844 million shares in iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), over $800 million in the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), about $202 million in Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), and close to $45 million each in ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust (BITB).However, the filing reveals that these holdings only account for 3% of Millennium’s $64 billion assets under management.Other top Bitcoin ETF holders in Q1 following Millennium were Susquehanna International Group ($1.1 billion), Bracebridge Capital ($404 million), Boothbay Fund Management ($303 million), and Morgan Stanley ($251 million).Breaking Records for New ETFsAccording to Bitwise’s CIO Matt Hougan, the investment trend in Bitcoin ETFs is gaining momentum. The current level of institutional ownership is unprecedented for a new ETF. Traditionally, most ETFs see minimal participation from large investors in their initial months.For instance, the gold ETF launch in late 2004 was considered wildly successful, amassing over $1 billion in its first five days. However, even at its first 13F filing, only 95 professional firms held positions in the gold ETF. By comparison, Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing a historic surge in terms of the sheer number of institutional investors involved.While professional investors currently hold an estimated 20% of the total Bitcoin ETF assets, retail investors still dominate the landscape. However, Hougan noted that these early institutional allocations could be just the tip of the iceberg as institutional engagement deepens.“…the allocations we see in recent 13F filings are just a down payment. Hightower Advisors may have $68 million allocated to bitcoin ETFs today, for instance, which is great, but it’s just 0.05% of their assets. If they follow the pattern outlined above, that allocation will build over time. And to put it in context, a 1% allocation of their portfolio to bitcoin would equate to $1.2 billion—all from a single firm,” Hougan stated.“Multiply that by the growing number of professional investors participating in the space, and you can begin to see what’s behind my enthusiasm,” he added.

Tether Scandal: Chinese Authorities Uncover Alleged $2B USDT Money Laundering Operation | Bitcoinist.com


								Chinese law enforcement agencies have announced a breakthrough in their fight against illegal financial activities. They have dismantled a large underground banking gang allegedly involved in facilitating illegal transactions using Tether’s USDT stablecoin. 
The operation spans multiple provinces and is believed to have enabled over $2 billion worth of illicit USDT transactions. 
193 Suspects Arrested In Tether-Linked Banking Scandal
According to local media reports, the Chengdu Municipal Public Security Bureau uncovered a significant underground banking case involving a staggering 13.8 billion yuan ($1.9 billion). 
The operation was spread across 26 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. 193 suspects have been arrested nationwide, with public security agencies in each jurisdiction filing 58 cases. Authorities have also frozen 149 million yuan in funds associated with the operation.

The investigation was initiated in November 2022 when the Longquanyi District Branch identified suspicious fund settlements through underground banks, indicating potential engagement in illegal foreign exchange activities. 
The Chengdu Municipal Public Security Bureau reportedly formed a task force of various departments, including economic investigation, cyber security, legal affairs, and technical investigation. 
On June 1, 2023, the task force coordinated arrest operations in Shanghai, Changsha, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Fuzhou, Jinhua, and other locations under the command of the Ministry of Public Security and the Public Security Department. 
As a result, 25 criminal suspects, including Lin, Weng, and Chen, were apprehended, and significant evidence, such as bank cards and payment instruments, was seized.
$1.9 Billion Illegal Scheme Unveiled
The investigation revealed that the criminal gang, led by Lin, Weng, Chen, and others, primarily operated within the import and export business sector. Authorities further claim that they allegedly exploited USDT as a medium to provide illegal services to customers seeking to transfer funds abroad. 
Their activities primarily involved illegal foreign exchange, payment, and settlement businesses, which reportedly facilitated the smuggling of drugs and cosmetics, overseas asset purchases, and fraudulent tax refund schemes. 
According to the report, Tether’s use of stablecoin allegedly allowed it to evade national foreign exchange supervision, posing “substantial risks” to foreign exchange security and financial management.
By reportedly utilizing USDT and collaborating with other companies for fund settlements, the gang engaged in various criminal activities, including financial fraud, job-related crimes, drug management obstruction, smuggling of prohibited goods, credit card fraud, and export tax refund fraud.
Crack Down On Criminal Operations
Tether has swiftly cracked down on criminal operations utilizing its digital currency in response to allegations of its involvement in illicit activities. Paolo Ardoino, the firm’s CEO, has consistently emphasized the company’s commitment to combating illicit activity and has called Tether “the dumbest choice for doing illicit activity.” 

Recently, Tether also took a decisive step to combat illicit activity by freezing approximately $5.2 million USDT. The action was taken in response to crypto tracking and compliance platform MistTrack findings. 
The platform identified 12 Ethereum addresses associated with phishing operations, which threatened users and the integrity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 
Tether has also implemented new security measures aimed at preventing illicit financial activities. In collaboration with Chainalysis, a crypto tracking and compliance platform, the stablecoin issuer has developed a tool specifically designed to monitor secondary markets. This enables Tether to detect and address any suspicious or unauthorized transactions promptly.

Examining how Bitcoin ETFs drove Galaxy Digital's 40% hike - AMBCrypto



Galaxy Digital’s net income jumped 40%, with the same attributed to spot Bitcoin ETFs’ impact
Galaxy Trading also saw a hike in revenue and volumes

Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. has emerged as a significant player in the financial realm after seeing a surge in net income by 40% to $422 million. Interestingly, analysts are attributing this growth to the impact of spot Bitcoin [BTC] Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). 
In fact, the upward trajectory coincided with a notable resurgence in net inflows observed in spot Bitcoin ETFs on 14 May, following four consecutive weeks of outflows. According to reports, there were total inflows of $116.8 million last week, indicating renewed interest among investors.
Good day for Bitcoin 
These inflows might have had an impact on the price action of Bitcoin too. After flashing all reds over the past week, Bitcoin, at press time, was recovering on the charts following a 6% hike in 24 hours. 
The same was confirmed by the Relative Strength Index climbing close to the 50-level on the charts.
Providing further insights into Galaxy Digital’s Q1 results, analyst Joseph Vafi noted, 
“Spot bitcoin ETF approvals have been a major catalyst for the increase in counterparty engagement as some of the more traditional asset managers and hedge funds are entering/reentering the space.” 
According to the firm’s first-quarter report, 
“Trading reported counterparty trading revenue of $66 million in the first quarter, primarily driven by increased revenue from derivatives and favorable asset price movements.” 
Galaxy Digital’s Q1 report 
The report further claimed that counterparty trading volumes appreciated by 78%, compared to the prior quarter. This, while the average loan book size expanded to $664 million. 
This underlines the increasing importance of platforms like Galaxy Trading in facilitating digital asset exchange and investment. 
Additionally, Galaxy posted a record Bitcoin mining revenue of $31.5 million, a 69% hike from the previous quarter.
Source: Alyssa Choo/X
Here, it’s worth noting that the company mined 373 bitcoins at an average cost of less than $19,500 per Bitcoin, highlighting its efficiency in its mining processes.
Remarking on the same, Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd, said, 
“Our first-quarter results underscore the strength and resilience of our business model.” 
In conclusion, while optimism prevails, market uncertainties remain unpredictable. However, the launch of the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, along with two new XTrackers Exchange Traded Commodities in partnership with DWS Group, paints a promising path forward for the firm.

Bitcoin ETF Flows Surge to Two-Week High as BTC Soared Beyond $66,000


																Inflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States soared to $303 million on May 15 amid a big jump in BTC prices.
It is the highest inflow since May 3 as institutional inventors pivoted back to bullish in the wake of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on May 15 which met expectations.
Fidelity led the pack with its FBTC fund seeing $131 million in inflows for the day, its highest inflow since March 26. Bitwise’s BITB fund also had a solid day with an inflow of $86 million, a figure not beaten since March 4.
BlackRock’s IBIT fund saw its third consecutive trading day of zero flows, but experts have previously explained that this is perfectly normal for a fund of this nature.
Spot ETFs Surge
Even Grayscale’s GBTC saw an inflow with $27 million returning to its flagship BTC fund following four months of outflows.


Additionally, the latest US Security and Exchange Commission filings show that one of the world’s largest hedge funds, Millennium Management, holds a whopping $2 billion spot Bitcoin ETF portfolio.
This was commented on by prominent ETF analysts, with James Seyffart quipping, “It’s only retail traders buying the Bitcoin ETFs.”
The portfolio is comprised of $844.2 million in BlackRock’s IBIT, $806.7 million in Fidelity’s FBTC, $202 million in Grayscale’s GBTC, $45.0 million in Ark’s ARKB, and $44.7 million in Bitwise’s BITB.
Millennium is now the largest holder of IBIT and FBTC. The hedge fund led by billionaire Izzy Englander has more than $64 billion in assets under management.


May 15 was the deadline for institutional investment firms to file their quarterly 13F report with the SEC for their positions held as of the end of Q1.
Another major hedge fund, Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital, disclosed a stake of nearly $12 million in IBIT, and Apollo Management Holdings disclosed a stake of $53 million in ARK 21Shares’ ARKB.
BTC Tapped $66,000
The big ETF inflow day came amid big gains for bitcoin’s price. The asset has surged 7% over the past 24 hours, tapping $66,567 during early trading in Asia on Thursday morning.
BTC was changing hands for $65,900 at the time of writing, following a gain of 15% over the past fortnight, bringing it to just 10% from its all-time high.
Crypto markets reacted to the April CPI data in the US, which came in lower than expected at 0.3%.
The report is a key indicator of inflationary trends, and it has increased the likelihood of the Federal Reserve reducing rates and injecting more liquidity into markets, which is good news for high-risk assets such as crypto.

Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) Will Explode 17,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 17,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




DIAPAWS will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Diamond Paws.



Currently, Diamond Paws can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DIAPAWS on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Diamond Paws by entering its contract address – HCEn3J1sKqMqPxrQDE33rGhJvyXh4r3YgyzD2wiAm3ga – in the receiving field.




DIAPAWS currently has a market cap of just under $16,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Futures Exchange Giant CME Plans To Kick Off Bitcoin Trading


According to a Thursday report by the Financial Times, Chicago-based futures exchange CME Group is on track to launch Bitcoin spot trading due to growing demand.  It is unclear when spot Bitcoin trading will become available on the exchange since the plan is yet to be finalized. It is worth noting that CME Group has long been a major player in the crypto market. It initially launched Bitcoin futures in December 2017, a move that coincided with the peak of the bull run. In May 2021, it also launched micro Bitcoin futures, responding to demand for futures contracts of smaller size. According to data provided by CoinGlass, CME is currently in the lead when it comes to Bitcoin futures open interest with $9 billion. It is ahead of such major crypto native players as Binance, OKX, and BitMEX. In early 2020, CME also launched Bitcoin options on its futures contracts. CME comes in second place in terms of options value, significantly lagging behind Deribit. The growing demand for spot trading comes after the launch of several spot ETFs earlier this year. According to the most recent data, spot Bitcoin ETFs managed to attract $303 million worth of inflows on Wednesday.

Millennium Discloses $2 Billion Bitcoin ETF Holdings for Q1 2024


Millennium Management, a global investment firm with over $60 billion in assets, has disclosed its significant Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) holdings for the first quarter of 2024.
According to a recent 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Millennium holds approximately $1.9 billion in various US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs.
Institutional Bitcoin ETF Investments Surge

The firm’s largest holdings include BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). In addition, Millennium holds smaller stakes in the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Specifically, the filing details Millennium’s investments as $844.2 million in IBIT, $806.7 million in FBTC, $202 million in GBTC, $45 million in ARKB, and $44.7 million in BITB.

Other prominent asset managers are also increasing their Bitcoin ETF holdings. Pine Ridge reported $205 million in IBIT, FBTC, and BITB. Meanwhile, Schonfeld Strategic Advisors disclosed $248 million in IBIT and $231.8 million in FBTC, totaling $479 million.
Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, highlighted the significant trend of institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs. According to Hougan, approximately 563 professional investment firms reported owning $3.5 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs last Thursday. By the filing deadline, he anticipates that the market may see over 700 professional firms and total assets under management (AUM) approaching $5 billion.

“This is absolutely massive. For any financial advisor, family office, or institution wondering if they were the only one considering Bitcoin exposure, the answer is clear: You are not alone,” Hougan affirmed.

Hougan compared the interest in Bitcoin ETFs to that of gold ETFs launched in 2004, which were considered highly successful. Gold ETFs attracted over $1 billion in their first five days, with just 95 professional firms invested at the initial 13F filing.


“From a breadth of ownership perspective, the Bitcoin ETFs are a historic success,” he said.

Although most Bitcoin ETF investments are currently from retail investors, Hougan noted a potential for a growing trend among institutions. For instance, Hightower Advisors has $68 million allocated to Bitcoin ETFs, just 0.05% of their assets. Hougan predicts that such allocations will increase over time, potentially reaching significant proportions within institutional portfolios.

“Multiply that by the growing number of professional investors participating in the space, and you can begin to see what’s behind my enthusiasm,” he explained.

Indeed, substantial investments by institutions like Millennium Management underscore the growing integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream financial portfolios. This increased institutional backing signals long-term confidence in digital assets’ potential, potentially paving the way for broader crypto adoption.

Shiba Inu Faces Market Shift: Whale Transactions Decline as Subtle Bullish Signals Emerge



                    

Recent data reveals a 15% decrease in significant transactions involving Shiba Inu, a development that could considerably impact the cryptocurrency’s market dynamics. 



This decline is typically indicative of diminished activity by whales, the large-scale investors whose substantial trades can significantly influence market directions. 




Such a trend might suggest waning confidence among these investors or a pivot towards smaller, more discreet transactions.



In spite of this downturn in large transactions, there are faint signs of bullish sentiment. 



A marginal increase of 0.32% in the creation of new addresses on the SHIB network hints at a growing interest or the arrival of new participants in the market. 




This is generally viewed as a positive indicator, although the minimal rise indicates a lack of strong new momentum. 



Moreover, there’s a slight 0.04% uptick in the concentration of SHIB holdings among top addresses, suggesting that some major holders may be quietly increasing their stakes, or that a smaller number of addresses are accumulating more SHIB.

Currently, SHIB is experiencing a consolidation within a tightening price range, suggesting a potential spike in volatility soon. 




The decline in transactions by major investors could lessen the impact of significant sell-offs or purchases, possibly leading to a temporary stabilization of prices. 



Nevertheless, the ongoing consolidation phase points to a likely breakout, the direction of which will probably be influenced by broader market trends rather than SHIB-specific factors.



The landscape of Shiba Inu’s market is undergoing a complex transformation, highlighted by the reduction in large transactions coupled with modest bullish indicators. 



While the decrease in significant transactions might reflect a lack of confidence among larger investors, the incremental growth in new addresses and the slight increase in holdings by top addresses indicate a burgeoning interest. 



As SHIB navigates through a narrowing price range, an impending volatility spike seems imminent. 



The future trajectory of Shiba Inu will largely hinge on overall market movements, making it a cryptocurrency worth monitoring.

The hedge fund diversified its holdings of spot Bitcoin ETF products across ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC).BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund was Millenium’s largest allocation, with over $844 million invested.

Additionally, the majority — roughly 60% — of new spot Bitcoin ETF buyers were comprised of investment advisory firms while around 25% were hedge funds, Blachunas shared.Source: Eric BalchunasThe recent spate of compulsory 13F filings has shed light on who is buying spot Bitcoin ETFs, something Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan says has made him increasingly “bullish on Bitcoin’s future.”Related: Vanguard’s new boss says Bitcoin ETF not on the table: ReportIn a May 13 memo to investors, Hougan wrote that the quarterly 13F filings have shared important details behind who is actually buying these funds, adding that the outsized scale of institutional interest in these products was a good sign for Bitcoin moving forward.“The big news is: a lot of professional investors own Bitcoin ETFs,” wrote Hougan, drawing special attention to the presence of firms such as Hightower Advisors, Bracebridge Capital, and Cambridge Investment Research as holders of the Bitcoin products. “By the time the May 15 filing deadline arrives, I suspect we may end up with 700+ professional firms and a total AUM approaching $5 billion,” added Hougan.

Coinbase Eyes Australian Pension Market With Bitcoin Service Tailored For Self-Managed Funds - Coinbase Glb (NASDAQ:COIN) - Benzinga

In a strategic move to tap into the burgeoning Australian pension market, Coinbase Global Inc. COIN is developing a service tailored to the self-managed pensions sector in Australia.What Happened: Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., is focusing on the self-managed pensions sector in Australia, a market that constitutes about a quarter of the country’s $2.5 trillion pension system. The sector currently has approximately A$1 billion ($664 million) invested in cryptocurrencies, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.John O'Loghlen, Coinbase’s Managing Director for Asia-Pacific, revealed that the exchange is tailoring a service to cater to these clients, who often make a single allocation and leave it untouched. This move comes as Bitcoin‘s BTC/USD price has surged by around 45% this year following the launch of ETFs."Self-managed super funds might just make a single allocation and set it and forget it," said O'Loghlen. "We are working on an offering to service those clients really well on a one-off basis — to have them trade with us and stay with us."See Also: Pepe Pumps 8% And Millionaire Trader Thinks Will Become ‘So Nutty Soon’ That His $1M Investment Will Outperform All OthersO'Loghlen, a former employee of Ant Group and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., believes that the recent ETF launches in the U.S. have boosted the crypto market, leading to an all-time high for Bitcoin in March. He predicts that Australia will introduce more crypto ETFs by the end of 2024.Why It Matters: The move by Coinbase to target the Australian pension sector comes at a time when institutional investors are increasingly considering cryptocurrencies as a viable investment option. Earlier in March, the world’s largest pension fund, the Government Pension Investment Fund of Japan, expressed interest in diversifying its portfolio with Bitcoin.Australia’s cryptocurrency market has been experiencing significant developments. The Australian Securities Exchange is reportedly set to approve the country’s first spot-Bitcoin ETF before the end of 2024. This move is expected to further fuel the growth of the cryptocurrency market in Australia.Despite the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, there are still concerns about the risks associated with the sector. Financial advisers, such as Michael Houlihan, have cautioned against allocating a significant portion of a portfolio to high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. "You wouldn't want a significant part of a portfolio in something that's such high risk," he said.Read Next: Why This Crypto Market Is ‘A Bear Trap’ And Which Coins This Trader Is BackingImage Via Shutterstock Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh BagalkoteThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

CME Group to Venture into Bitcoin Trading | Coinspeaker



CME Group aims to tap into the growing interest in Bitcoin among major players in the financial sector to establish a regulated marketplace that offers users direct exposure to the kingcoin.

CME Group, a prominent global futures trading company headquartered in the United States, is gearing up to enter the world of cryptocurrency by introducing a dedicated trading platform for Bitcoin (BTC) spot traders.
According to a Financial Times report citing three people familiar with the matter, the company has held a series of meetings with potential customers who would like to purchase the leading crypto asset on a regulated marketplace.




Although the plan is still in the works, its potential implications signify a noteworthy milestone in the widespread acceptance of digital assets in the US, particularly following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the country.
CME Group Target’s Financial Giants
The SEC’s approval of new investment products in January 2024 has opened up new opportunities for established financial institutions to venture into innovative areas within the crypto economy.
Since then, several financial institutions from around the world have already entered the crypto scene, with CME Group being the latest to join the trend with the planned launch of a Bitcoin trading marketplace. The company’s target market includes Wall Street money managers and other corporate investors currently engaging with the emerging economy.
CME Group aims to tap into the growing interest in Bitcoin among major players in the financial sector to establish a regulated marketplace that offers users direct exposure to the kingcoin.
The company already operates a successful futures market for Bitcoin. However, the planned introduction of another marketplace for spot traders allows investors to execute basic trades more efficiently, taking advantage of price differences between the two types of contracts.
The US-based group recently surpassed Binance as the world’s largest Bitcoin futures market, with about 26,000 open positions valued at around $8.5 billion on its Chicago market.
Bitcoin’s Journey from All-Time High to Recovery
Meanwhile, the planned launch of a Bitcoin trading platform by CME Group comes at a time when the crypto market is reeling from the aftereffects of the Bitcoin halving, which took place in April 2024.
The leading crypto asset in the industry is down from its all-time high of over $73,000 in March this year, after recovering from its two-year lows since the 2022 market winter, which saw billions of dollars wiped out from the industry.
The month of April has been a rollercoaster ride for investors in the crypto market as Bitcoin slipped below $57,000 for the first time after reaching its new all-time high in March. This downward trajectory continued into May.
During this volatile period, many investors faced significant losses. On April 19, about $300 million was liquidated from both short and long positions. On May 13, approximately $130 million was wiped out within 24 hours, with Bitcoin and Ethereum bearing the brunt of the impact.
However, as of the time of writing, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have slightly recovered from their previous lows of $60,000 and $2,900, respectively. According to CoinMarketCap data, the two crypto assets are currently trading around $65,958 and $3,016, respectively.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Predictions, and More: Recap May 16


																TL;DR

Bitcoin’s price surged from $61,500 to over $66,500, possibly driven by the release of US CPI data.
Shiba Inu saw a 9% price increase, with analysts predicting further gains of up to 50% based on technical patterns.
PEPE achieved a new all-time high on May 15, becoming the third-largest meme coin by market cap, with all holders realizing paper profits at one point.


BTC Resurgence
After trading sideways in the past several days, the price of the primary cryptocurrency has once again headed north on May 15. It soared from $61,500 to over $66,500 in a matter of hours, currently standing at approximately $66,000 (per CoinGecko’s data).
BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko
The uptick occurred shortly after the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. It showed that the inflation rate in the world’s largest economy clocked in at 3.4%, meeting previous expectations.
The Federal Reserve’s goal is to decrease the annual inflation to 2%. As such, it implemented multiple measures in the past few years, including rate hikes. America’s central bank hinted at a pivot sometime this year which is seen by many industry participants as a bullish factor for Bitcoin and the entire industry.
After all, lowering interest rates makes money borrowing easier, possibly sparking more interest in riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies.




SHIB Forecasts
The popular meme coin has also experienced a substantial uptick, with its price soaring by 9% on a 24-hour scale. 
Several analysts, such as the X users Ali Martinez and Dami-Defi, believe SHIB is yet to witness a bull run. The former envisioned a 20% surge should it break “the upper boundary of this descending parallel channel at $0.00002444.”
Dami-Defi was even more bullish, predicting a 50% increase based on “a falling wedge pattern on the 1D time frame.” They also suggested that the entire meme coin sector will continue to flourish in the following months.
PEPE’s Success
The frog-themed meme coin has outperformed many of the leading cryptocurrencies in the last few days, registering a double-digit price spike. As CryptoPotato reported, it hit a new all-time high on May 15, whereas its market capitalization neared a whopping $5 billion.
PEPE’s price slightly retraced in the past several hours, but it remains the third-biggest asset in the meme coin cohort. The forth-largest – dogwifhat (WIF) – trails behind with a market cap of approximately $3 billion.
Somewhat expectedly, PEPE’s latest revival has benefited investors. According to IntoTheBlock, 100% of the coin’s holders stood at paper profits on May 14.

Chinese police bust $1.9B USDT underground banking racket

Chinese police have unearthed a $1.9 billion underground banking racket involving popular stablecoin Tether (USDT).The underground banking operations operated in the Chinese city of Chengdu and used the USDT stablecoin to exchange foreign currencies. The city police issued a media report highlighting the details of the underground operations and said they had arrested 193 suspects across 26 provinces. The Police report noted that the underground USDT banking operations began in January 2021 and were primarily used to smuggle medicine, cosmetics, and investment assets overseas.The authorities destroyed two underground operations in Fujian and Hunan, and the police also froze 149 million yuan worth $20 million linked to the USDT banking operations.Despite a comprehensive prohibition on crypto-related activities in China, Chinese traders persist in circumventing the national ban and utilizing crypto assets in alternative ways. A report published by Kyros Ventures indicates that Chinese traders are among the largest stablecoin holders worldwide. The report indicates that 33.3% of Chinese investors hold a large number of stablecoins, ranking them second only to Vietnam’s 58.6%, indicating a higher level of risk appetite.Source: Kyros VenturesThe Chinese government has banned the use of cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency exchanges, along with Bitcoin mining operations. However, the local population has found ways to evade such a ban over the years. Related: China’s most valuable company pivoting to AI as gaming profits falterAt the time of the Bitcoin mining ban, China was the largest contributor to the Bitcoin (BTC) network hash rate, which dropped to nearly zero right after the ban. However, within a year, Chinese mining hash rate contribution rose to second place, indicating that individuals continue to defy the ban.Similarly, after the country banned the use of centralized exchanges, Chinese traders turned to decentralized protocols to carry out trade. In the wake of the ban, there was a significant spike in the use of DeFi-based protocols by Chinese traders, while some defied the ban using virtual private networks (VPNs).Magazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market: Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in

                        Coinbase exchange is having big plans in developing services that targets Australia’s $600 billion self-managed pension sector, Bloomberg reported.The largest US crypto exchange is reportedly developing a tailored service to tap the unfilled demand over crypto products, Coinbase’s Asia-Pacific Managing Director John O’Loghlen, confirmed.“Self-managed super funds might just make a single allocation and set it and forget it. We are working on an offering to service those clients really well on a one-off basis — to have them trade with us and stay with us.”According to latest Australian Taxation Office data, self-managed pension portfolios form a quarter of Australia’s $2.5 trillion pension system. These encompass AU$1 billion ($664 million), designated to crypto assets, which is down from a 2021 peak of AU$1.5 billion.The fall could be attributed to some institutional money managers in Australia who refrain from the crypto sector, given its past scandals and high volatility. However, recent changes such as talks to launch a crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Australia, and Bitcoin price increase have significantly increased the cryptos held within these self-managed retirement fund.Aussie’s DIY Pension Sector Lost Millions in Crypto Bets
Besides, Michael Houlihan, head of a private wealth management firm, publicly warned investors to avoid large stake in risky assets.“You wouldn’t want a significant part of a portfolio in something that’s such high risk,” he noted. Investors interested in cryptos are typically in their 40s with low account balances, Houlihan added.This is true in previous cases, for instance, in 2023, thousands of Australians who used do-it-yourself (DIY) pension funds to bet on cryptocurrencies, faced hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.Such risky bets jeopardised their savings in a scheme originally set up to ensure adequate retirement income. Per a Reuters’ analysis last year, these bets fall outside the remit of prudential regulator that oversees professionally managed funds.Elsewhere in the world, freewheeling DIY pension sector comes with some regulation. In the UK, self-managed pension funds cannot directly invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

600 Billion Dollar Move from Bitcoin Exchange Coinbase! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the USA, is planning to expand to Australia.
At this point, Coinbase plans to provide services targeting Australia's $600 billion retirement industry.

Boosting AI: Senators propose $32B investment plan for US tech growth

A bipartisan group of four senators led by United States Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence (AI) and establish safeguards around it.The roadmap is another effort by the U.S. government to regulate and promote AI development. It comes six days after legislators in the U.S. unveiled a bipartisan bill to aid President Joe Biden’s administration in imposing export controls on top AI models created in the country. After months of meetings with industry experts and AI critics, the bipartisan working group identified the importance of AI investments to keep the U.S. competitive with its rivals abroad and improve Americans’ quality of life — supporting technology that could help cure some cancers or chronic illnesses.While the roadmap doesn’t constitute a concrete bill or policy proposal, it provides a glimpse into the scope and magnitude of what lawmakers and relevant parties envision for future AI legislation, setting the stage for more comprehensive and detailed policies to come.The senators’ proposal also calls for enforcing “existing laws for AI,” including addressing any gaps or unintended harmful bias, prioritizing the development of standards for testing to understand potential AI harms, and developing use case-specific requirements for AI transparency and explainability.The group also recommended new requirements for transparency as AI products are rolled out and that studies be conducted into the potential impact of AI on jobs and the U.S. workforce.Related: OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist departs AI firmThe AI Working Group is not pioneering the effort to regulate the rapid progress of generative AI (genAI) and general AI development and adoption. In February, the National Institute of Standards and Technology formed the AI Safety Institute Consortium, which brought together over 200 organizations to establish safety guidelines for AI systems.According to experts, the U.S. is lagging behind several other countries, including the European Union, which has taken a significant lead in regulating AI. In March, the EU established a comprehensive new law governing AI across its 27 member states, putting pressure on the U.S. to catch up.The law created safeguards for general-purpose AI, limited law enforcement’s use of biometric identification systems, banned online social scoring and AI manipulation or exploiting user vulnerabilities, and gave consumers the right to launch complaints and get “meaningful explanations” from AI providers.

Bitcoin Self-Custody and Home Mining Made Legal Rights in Oklahoma After Passage Of Landmark Bill - Benzinga

In a landmark development, Oklahoma became the first state in the U.S. to declare self-custody of Bitcoin BTC/USD and other cryptocurrencies a fundamental right.What Happened: The bill proposed by Rep. Brian Hill (R) was signed into law by Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt (R), paving the way for greater autonomy for citizens regarding their cryptocurrency usage.The bill mandated a legal right to use digital assets for purchasing goods and services, self-custody of digital assets using a self-hosted wallet or a hardware wallet, and even mining digital assets from home. The bill also stipulated that no additional taxes would be levied on digital asset payments, treating them the same as traditional forms of payment. The bill would be effective from Nov.1 this year.Why It Matters: The new legislation comes at a time when the country is becoming increasingly polarized over cryptocurrencies and their increased oversight.Last week, the House voted in favor of a resolution against the SEC's controversial directive that restricted credible financial institutions from holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. President Joe Biden had threatened to veto the legislation if it reached him. On the other hand, former President Donald Trump has stepped up his pro-crypto stance in the election campaigns, promising to make the atmosphere more conducive so as to stop cryptocurrency companies from moving out of the country. He even said, "If you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump."Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $65,837.53, rising 6.41% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Photo Courtesy: Shutterstock.comRead Next: Robinhood Launches Its First Crypto Staking Offering For Solana But Feature Limited To Europe

Swiss leaders plan to enforce global crypto reporting framework

The highest authority in Switzerland issued a public consultation for its plans to adopt global standards for crypto tax reporting to “ensure equal treatment” as traditional assets.The Federal Council — a group of seven members that collectively head the Swiss government — intends to implement the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) to improve tax transparency. On May 15, the Federal Council launched a consultation paper to gauge public sentiment around joining the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI), a cooperation between international tax administrations to fight tax evasion. Switzerland’s extension into the AEOI is currently slated for Jan. 1, 2026.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established AEOI and other initiatives for the Group of 20 (G20) nations, which were later extended to include other nations.Switzerland previously adopted the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (CRS) in 2014, but it left out CARF, which regulates the handling of crypto assets and their providers. Planning to change that reality, the Federal Council said:“Implementation of the CARF will expand Switzerland’s progressive crypto market regulation and help to maintain the credibility and reputation of the Swiss financial center.”However, the CARF implementation will require parliamentary approval and cannot be based solely on the responses to the consultation paper.By 2027, nearly 50 countries are expected to fully adopt the CARF regulations to mutually help fight money laundering.The Swiss federal authority intends to “close gaps in the tax transparency mechanism and ensure equal treatment with respect to traditional assets and financial institutions.”The consultation will run for over three months and end on Sept. 6.Related: G20 moves forward with international crypto frameworkIn April 2024, Canada’s annual budget suggested that the country will implement the CARF for taxation by 2026 as well.The CARF would impose new reporting requirements on crypto asset service providers, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto-asset brokers and dealers and crypto-asset automated teller machine operators. When the regulation sets in, Canadian individuals and businesses will be required to report transactions between crypto assets and fiat and crypto assets for other crypto assets to the Canada Revenue Agency.Magazine: UK cannabis millionaire’s legal ‘deals on wheels’ via crypto

An ascending triangle typically forms when an area of horizontal resistance is continually tested while higher lows are consecutively being formed. A bullish ascending triangle is confirmed when a breakout above the horizontal resistance occurs.
In response to a post by the pseudonymous quant analyst PlanB that the price of Bitcoin appreciates drastically between two to five months following the halving, Woo says that the four-year event triggers a reorganization among BTC miners leaving only the fittest to survive. The fourth Bitcoin halving took place on April 19th.
“Inefficient miners get culled at the halving.
They dump their BTC before dying. 
Only the strong ones survive.
They operate on fatter margins so don’t need to sell.
Miner sell pressure gone.
Takes two to five months for the new supply/demand to reflect in price.”
According to PlanB,
“Historically, Bitcoin miner revenue recovers two to five months after a halving, and after that Bitcoin price goes vertical.”

Bitcoin is trading at $62,373 at time of writing, about 15% below the all-time high reached in March.

El Salvador Mines $29 Million in Bitcoin Using Volcanic Energy Amid Global Scrutiny and Environmental Debate



                    

Since 2021, El Salvador has successfully mined 474 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $29 million, using the renewable geothermal energy harnessed from its Tecapa volcano. 



The mining operation involves 300 processors and draws 1.5 megawatts from the 102 MW generated by a state-owned plant, as reported by Reuters.




El Salvador has taken significant strides in the cryptocurrency realm, especially in integrating renewable energy for Bitcoin (BTC) mining—a sector often criticized for its substantial energy consumption and reliance on fossil fuels. 



This initiative places El Salvador at the forefront of sustainable BTC mining practices.



In a historic move in 2021, El Salvador became the first country to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, on par with the U.S. dollar. 




This decision was part of a broader strategy that included the development of a geothermal plant specifically for mining BTC. 



Presently, El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserves amount to about 5,750 BTC, worth around $354 million.



However, the adoption of Bitcoin has not been without controversy. 



Since its decision, El Salvador has faced intense criticism from global entities like the World Bank, mainly due to concerns about the implications of embracing a digital currency.




The skepticism intensified during the cryptocurrency bear market from 2022 to 2023, putting additional pressure on President Nayib Bukele’s pro-Bitcoin policies. 



Despite this, Bukele reaffirmed his commitment to the cryptocurrency by promising the daily purchase of one BTC, a move that seemed to garner domestic approval as evidenced by his decisive victory in the 2024 presidential election.



The debate over Bitcoin’s environmental toll is ongoing within the broader crypto industry.

Advocacy groups like the Ripple-backed Greenpeace have been pushing for Bitcoin to transition from the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) framework. 



This environmental concern led to legislative action, such as New York becoming the first U.S. state to enact a two-year moratorium on PoW mining, signed into law by Governor Kathy Hochul on November 22, 2023.



Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, briefly considered Bitcoin as a payment method for Tesla vehicles after purchasing $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. 



However, Musk rescinded this decision, citing environmental concerns associated with Bitcoin mining. 



He stated that he would reconsider only if the mining process became predominantly renewable, noting that recent reports indicate over 60% of BTC mining now utilizes green energy. 



Despite these developments, Musk has not confirmed the reintroduction of Bitcoin payments. Meanwhile, Tesla is currently dealing with a lawsuit alleging violations of the Clean Air Act at its Fremont factory.

Millennium Leads Wall Street Charge into Bitcoin ETFs


							

Industry giant Millennium Management LLC holds nearly $2 billion across various spot Bitcoin ETFs launched earlier this year.



Bitwise CIO, Matt Hougan, predicts the investor base for these ETFs could reach 700, a significant increase compared to typical launches.



Hougan described the level of institutional interest as “unprecedented,” highlighting the growing acceptance of Bitcoin within traditional financial markets.




A surge of hedge funds and asset managers, including industry giant Millennium Management LLC, have poured in significant capital into the spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) approved in the United States earlier this year. The move underscores growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency, a once-niche asset class.











According to regulatory filings analyzed by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, New York-based Millennium Management disclosed holdings of nearly $2 billion across various Bitcoin ETFs as of March 31. These investments spanned:



BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust



The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust



Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund



Bitwise Bitcoin ETF



ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF



Boston-based Bracebridge Capital, which manages investments for prestigious institutions like Yale and Princeton Universities, also entered the fray. They revealed ownership of $262 million in shares of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and $81 million in the BlackRock product.



Even the Wisconsin Investment Board, overseeing assets for the state’s retirement system, joined the wave. They purchased over $99 million in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and hold more than $63 million in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.









Balchunas’ analysis of 13F filings for the first quarter suggests a staggering number of investors – over 500 – have flocked to the spot BTC ETFs. This represents more than 200 times the average number of investors for a newly launched exchange-traded fund. Notably, 60% of these holders are investment advisors, while hedge funds comprise 25%.



In a client memo posted on Bitwise’s platform, Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan predicted the investor base could swell to 700, with total Assets Under Management (AUM) reaching $5 billion. Hougan described this level of investment as “unprecedented.”

Bitcoin ETF Deadline Ends With A Bang: Institutions Buy Big


								The curtain fell on the first-quarter 13F filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, and the reports revealed a seismic shift in institutional investment patterns toward spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with Millennium Management emerging as a frontrunner in this new asset class.
Millennium Becomes The King Of Bitcoin ETFs
Millennium Management, helmed by billionaire Izzy Englander and overseeing assets worth over $64 billion, reported an unprecedented $2 billion investment distributed among several Bitcoin ETFs. This mammoth investment has not only positioned Millennium at the zenith of Bitcoin ETF ownership but also signals a broader acceptance and validation within traditional investment frameworks.
The detailed disclosure showed Millennium’s investments spread across five major funds: $844,181,820 in BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) which represents 20,859,447 shares, $806,640,303 in Fidelity’s Wise Origin BTC Fund (FBTC) encompassing 12,997,749 shares, $202,029,915 in Grayscale’s BTC Trust (GBTC) holding 3,198,194 shares, $45,001,320 in ARK’s BTC ETF (ARKB) for 634,000 shares, and $44,737,805 in Bitwise’s BTC ETF (BITB) with 1,155,717 shares.

Renowned crypto analyst MacroScope remarked via X, “Major filing after the market closed today. Next to Wisconsin’s yesterday, certainly one of the most important BTC disclosures to date and it will get huge attention from asset managers.” On Tuesday, the State of Wisconsin disclosed a $161 million allocation in BlackRock’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC.
According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, this level of diversified investment across all Bitcoin ETFs is unprecedented. But “Millennium is king of the Bitcoin ETF holders with about $2 billion across four ETFs, out of over 500 holders. This is approximately 200 times the average for new ETFs,” Balchunas explained.
He further noted the majority of these investments came from investment advisors (60%) and a significant portion from hedge funds (25%). Balchunas also highlighted the rapid accumulation of liquidity and a diverse institutional footprint in IBIT, which is atypical for a newly launched ETF.


“You normally don’t see such a diverse range of holder types until years after an ETF’s launch,” he added, indicating the robust market confidence in Bitcoin’s potential as an investment asset.

The sector’s growth was further underscored by additional disclosures from other major financial entities. Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital disclosed an investment of nearly $12 million in BlackRock’s IBIT as of the end of the quarter, while Apollo Management Holdings reported a $53.2 million stake in ARK/21’s ARKB.
The wave of investment did not end with hedge funds and asset managers. Other notable entities such as Aristeia Capital and Hudson Bay Capital also revealed significant stakes in Bitcoin ETFs, contributing to the combined assets under management of all 10 available spot Bitcoin ETFs, which now stand at cumulative inflows of $12.1 billion.
As the deadline closed, the filings painted a picture of a rapidly maturing market where Bitcoin is no longer seen as just an alternative or speculative asset but as a viable part of diversified investment portfolios, attracting interest across the spectrum of financial institutions.
At press time, BTC traded at $65,771.

Worldcoin Foundation unveils new SMPC system, deletes old iris codes | Cryptopolitan

Just recently, the Worldcoin foundation, alongside TACEO, applied new secure multi-party computation (SMPC) for Machine Learning to Iris codes. The latest developments allow Worldcoin to establish an individual’s uniqueness. The foundation unveiled a new open-source system that reportedly handles biometric information more safely and securely.Considering the sensitivity around biometric data and personal data in general, Worldcoin has been compelled to continue building new technologies that align with stringent data protection measures.The new open-source software is currently available in the Github repository for interested developers to use and improve.The foundation, together with TACEO, aims to establish a new standard for data security, necessitating the development of this new technology.As a result, the Foundation successfully deleted iris codes previously collected while retaining the ability to establish uniqueness among individuals.Worldcoin Foundation applies SMPCThe SMPC stands for Secure Multi-Party Computation. The protocol itself is accessible on the GitHub repository. The Foundation decided to apply SMPC concurrently with Worldcoin’s existing Iris codes to ascertain their reliability.Also Read: Worldcoin Aims For Tech Partnerships Despite Regulatory StrugglesThe change to the new SMPC system requires 1152 cores and 3.6TB memory, and it uses 5 Gbps bandwidth across all parties. Despite the bump in system requirements, the new technology realizes faster implementation times, achieving up to 10,000X more.Why SMPC?Earlier attempts to use the SMPC technology have proven significantly challenging, considering the highly intensive computations required.The heavy system requirements have stifled its use, especially in biometric template protection. An excerpt from an International Red Cross research paper on SMPC reads“While SMC-Janus [an SMPC solution] offers the strongest data protection, its cost makes it unsuitable for large aid distribution projects.”Also Read: WORLDCOIN PRICE PREDICTION 2024 – 2033: HOW HIGH WILL WLD GO?The Foundation has reportedly considered several solutions available for biometric template protection. Nearly all of them fell short of the requirements, leaving only two options on the table. The homomorphic encryption also known and HE and SMPC.Both have been reported to provide sufficient privacy, security, and accuracy; however, according to the Foundation, SMPC offers a slightly better technology for uniqueness verification.The adjustments administered by the foundation also improve the overall performance of the SMPC, enhancing its performance to exceptional levels.  Cryptopolitan reporting by Collins J.

Andrew Tate plans a huge investment in Bitcoin

Andrew Tate, former kickboxer and American entrepreneur, known online as “Top G”, has announced his intention to convert over 100 million dollars into Bitcoin (BTC), completely abandoning fiat currency. 
This announcement coincides with a period of significant growth for Bitcoin, which has seen a 7% increase in the last 24 hours, surpassing the resistance level of $66,000.

Criticism of the Traditional Banking System
In a series of posts on social media “X”, previously known as Twitter, Tate expressed his disillusionment towards the traditional banking system, stating:

Bitcoin on the rise
The recent increase in Bitcoin price has caught the attention of industry experts.
The co-founders of the on-chain analysis company – Glassnode have observed and stated that this breakout was long awaited. According to them, recent data on inflation in the United States, lower than expected, and weaker retail sales could lead the Federal Reserve to a more “dovish” monetary policy. 
These factors have helped strengthen confidence in the cryptocurrency market. 
The co-founders of Glassnode also predict that Bitcoin could reach $66,000, then $69,000, and finally reach $84,000.
Bitcoin and the Legal Challenges for Andrew Tate
Actually for Tate this is a really critical private moment, in fact the former kickboxer seems to be involved in serious legal proceedings in Romania.
The charges are very serious: human trafficking and rape. 
The authorities, in this regard, have already seized various assets of Tate, including about 21 Bitcoins worth $560,000, along with luxury cars and real estate worth millions of dollars.
Despite his legal controversies, Tate still continues to have a sort of influence in the world of cryptocurrencies, remaining known especially for his provocative opinions and lavish lifestyle.

Wisconsin State BTC Investment Could Cause Chain Reaction From Other States


																In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) reported investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Grayscale.
According to SWIBs Form 13F for Q1 2024, the $156 billion pension fund purchased $64 million worth of Grayscale’s GBTC, and $99.2 million worth of BlackRock’s IBIT, with a total Bitcoin investment of just over $163 million.
The filing suggested that the crypto investment could be used for the Wisconsin Retirement System.
Other States to Follow?
On May 15, macroeconomics analyst “Macro Scope” suggested that other states would start to follow suit now that BTC investments can be easily accessed through regulatory-approved spot ETFs.
“Every state is doing this math right now. And the disclosure yesterday by Wisconsin will now become part of those conversations.”






The comments come in response to member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Keith Ammon, extolling the virtues of Bitcoin investments earlier this week.
On May 13, Ammon asked, “Should the State of New Hampshire investigate allocating a small percentage of its reserves into a Bitcoin ETF?”
He added that hindsight was a great thing, but had the State of New Hampshire put just 5% of its 2016 “rainy day fund” into Bitcoin and held it, “that amount of BTC today would be worth nearly half a billion dollars, a 10,000% ROI.”
Ammon, who commented on dollar devaluation on May 16, continued to say that New Hampshire has outstanding liabilities to the state pension system of $1.25 billion, asking how they could climb out of that hole.
“The answer may be staring us in the face, and it’s worthy of further investigation.”


Big Banks, Funds Buying BTC
In a separate post to X, Macro Scope said that Wisconsin’s disclosure was getting highlighted in industry publications before adding, “This will be widely discussed in the public and private investment sectors in coming weeks and months.”
On May 15, crypto industry observer “Marty Party” commented:
“Don’t underestimate this State of Wisconsin Investment Board buying Bitcoin ETFs. This will start a chain reaction,”
The Wisconsin SEC filing followed similar filings from major banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, disclosing around $760,000 and  $143,000 invested respectively in spot Bitcoin ETFs.
On May 15, one of the world’s largest hedge funds, Millennium Management, revealed a whopping $2 billion in holdings in spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Unknown Trader Nets $46 Million from Pepe Memecoin Amidst Resurgent GameStop Hype



                    

In a remarkable financial feat, an anonymous trader garnered over $46 million in profits from trading the Pepe memecoin, achieving a staggering 15,718 times return on their initial $3,000 investment. 



This individual initially purchased 4.9 trillion PEPE tokens on April 15, and by May 15, the value of these tokens had surged to more than $56 million. 




The trader has already cashed out 1.41 trillion PEPE for $7.4 million and still holds 3.5 trillion PEPE, currently valued at $38.9 million.



Pepe memecoin, with a market capitalization of $4.5 billion, is now the third largest behind giants like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, reflecting a 40% increase in value over just the past week. 



The resurgence in memecoins like Pepe is partly due to the same cultural disillusionment that propelled punk rock to prominence after initial skepticism. 




Hao Yang, head of financial products at Bybit exchange, compared the phenomenon to punk rock, telling Cointelegraph, 



“The success of memecoins can be seen, like punk rock, as a symptom of disillusioned young investors who have seen the opportunities afforded to their parents disappear.” 



Yang further critiqued the broader financial system, noting, “By printing tokens out of thin air and pumping them to billion-dollar valuations, these creators are showing the absurdity of our current fiat system.”



The recent spike in Pepe’s price appears linked to the renewed excitement around GameStop’s stock, which surged following Keith Gill’s return to social media after nearly three years. 




Gill’s comeback coincided with Pepe reaching new all-time highs and GameStop stock experiencing a dramatic 111% increase within 24 hours, surpassing Bitcoin’s annual returns.

Xiaohan Zhu, CEO of Meter, believes the GameStop saga played a crucial role in Pepe’s recent momentum. Zhu explained to Cointelegraph, 



“The GME saga may be one of the factors contributing to PEPE’s momentum.”



While it’s challenging to predict a broad memecoin rally, some speculate that the profits from the GameStop event might flow into other cryptocurrencies, similar to the 2021 bull market. 



However, not all memecoins will likely benefit from this trend, but Pepe, with its deep cultural resonance, seems well-positioned for further gains. 



Aleksandra Artamonovskaja, head of art at TriliTech, Tezos, emphasized Pepe’s unique cultural position, telling Cointelegraph, 



“Beyond being the most recognized meme on the internet, Pepe is a culture of its own and symbol against the establishment, symbol of freedom and hope – a relatable narrative of the GME saga.”

Crypto Markets Add $150B Daily as Bitcoin (BTC) Skyrocketed to 3-Week High (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price actions were quite underwhelming for days but the substantial ETF flows as well as the positive US CPI numbers resulted in massive gains that propelled the cryptocurrency to a 3-week peak of over $66,000.
The landscape with the altcoins is quite similar, with most turning green on a daily scale. ETH is above $3,000, while SOL and NEAR have soared by double digits.
Bitcoin Skyrockets Above $66K
The primary digital asset slumped hard last Friday to just over $61,000 after failing to overcome the $64,000 level. It used the relatively quiet weekend to regain some traction and remained around $61,000.
The bulls initiated a notable price surge on Monday that drove bitcoin to just over $63,000. Although it failed to conquer that line at first, it went on the offensive once again yesterday after the US CPI numbers for April came out.
The fact that they met the expectations of 3.4% resulted in a jump toward $64,000. The positive inflows in spot BTC ETFs in the States started another rally that pushed the cryptocurrency to a 3-week high of around $66,500.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


Despite losing some ground since then, bitcoin still trades above $66,000 now. Its market cap has soared past $1.3 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is close to 52%.

Shiba Inu, Avalanche, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, and Cardano have surged by somewhere between 6-8%. However, the most impressive gains come from Solana and NEAR Protocol’s native token.
SOL is up by 13% and stands well above $160, while NEAR has skyrocketed by 17% and trades north of $8.1.
TON and PEPE are the only larger-cap alts with notable price declines on a daily scale now.
The total crypto market cap has added roughly $150 billion since yesterday’s low and is now above $2.5 trillion.

Wall Street's Crypto Gateway: CME Considers Bitcoin Spot Trading


							

CME mulls Bitcoin spot trading to meet Wall Street’s crypto demand.



Easier access to “basis trading” is a potential benefit.



CME’s Bitcoin expansion could fuel regulated crypto market growth




The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a leading global derivatives marketplace, is exploring the possibility of launching Bitcoin spot trading. This move comes amid growing demand from Wall Street money managers seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency market through a regulated environment.



While a final decision has not been made, CME has reportedly held discussions with traders who expressed interest in a regulated platform for Bitcoin spot trading. Sources familiar with the discussions suggest that the new product, if approved, would provide Wall Street with a more direct route to participate in the cryptocurrency market.



CME already offers Bitcoin futures trading, but investors are eyeing the potential benefits of spot trading. If implemented,  investors would gain easier access to “basis trading,” a common strategy employed by both professional Bitcoin traders and the U.S. Treasury market. Notably, CME dominates the Treasury basis trading space.









CME has demonstrably profited from the recent surge in institutional interest in Bitcoin. The platform surpassed Binance to become the world’s largest Bitcoin futures market, currently holding approximately 26,000 open positions valued at roughly $8.5 billion.



However, some skepticism surrounds the potential approval of the proposal and CME’s future in the Bitcoin spot trading arena. A cryptocurrency trader expressed concerns about CME’s ability to capture a significant market share if its Bitcoin trading operates across two separate platforms: CME in Chicago and EBS in Switzerland. The trader questioned, “I struggle to see how they would get all the efficiencies available to them.”

Popular Memecoin Has Made an Update to Its Blockchain Network! Price is on the Rise! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Shiba Inu (SHIB) enthusiasts are on the rise today as ShibaSwap, the decentralized exchange (DEX) associated with the SHIB cryptocurrency, announced that it has expanded to the Shibarium blockchain, an Ethereum layer 2 solution developed by the SHIB token team.
SHIB Becomes More Scarce as Shibarium Blockchain Expands
The developers behind this move emphasized that increased use of the Shibarium blockchain for transactions will result in a faster burn rate for the SHIB token, ultimately reducing its circulating supply.


As a result of this announcement, the SHIB price has increased by 8.8% over the last 24 hours, aligning with a broader market rally.
With ShibaSwap, launched on Shibarium, users create new liquidity pools (LPs), allowing investors to swap tokens on the network and receive a share of transaction fees by providing liquidity.






According to the latest data, ShibaSwap has over $25 million in tokens locked as of today, with a total transaction volume of $1.7 million in the last 24 hours.
“The more transactions occur on the Shibarium blockchain, the more base gas fees the protocol will burn, which will affect the overall burn rate of SHIB,” said the developers, underlining the importance of increased activity on the blockchain.


Burning, a term that refers to the permanent removal of tokens from the circulating supply by sending them to an uncontrolled address, plays a crucial role in regulating token scarcity and therefore affecting market dynamics.
At the time of writing this article, SHIB token was traded at $0.0000256.

'You Are Still Early:' Bitcoin's Global Adoption Rate Hits 4.7%, Echoes Internet's Early Growth Phase, Says Analyst - Benzinga

The world's largest digital asset Bitcoin BTC/USD has the same number of users as the Internet had in early 1999, reflecting the cryptocurrency's immense scope for future growth.What Happened: Bitcoin's world adoption hit 4.7%, according to popular cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo, reminiscent of the Internet's growth curve in January 1999. The trajectory prompted Woo to say, "You are still early… and that’s backed by the best data available," referring to the present holders of the cryptocurrency.Bitcoin's user base was around 430 million as of this writing. The analyst last month, extrapolating multiple independent studies, had predicted that Bitcoin's total user base would swell to 500 million by October, and nearly a billion by the end of 2025.  Why It Matters: Bitcoin's fast pursuit of the Internet adoption curve raised optimism among proponents that the digital currency would eventually mimic the parabolic rise of the World Wide Web.The Internet frenzy took off at the turn of the millennium, ushering in an astronomical jump in the number of users. As of April 2024, there were 5.44 billion internet users worldwide, constituting 67% of the global population, according to Statista. The better part of the story is that Bitcoin was expanding faster than the Internet, as popular Bitcoin expert Vivek recently claimed. Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $65,837.53, rising 6.41% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The King Crypto was up 57% year-to-date, and nearly 150% since the same time last year.Read Next: Bitcoin Self-Custody and Home Mining Made Legal Rights in Oklahoma After Passage Of Landmark BillMohamed Hassan from Pixabay

Andrew Tate to dump fiat and buy $100M worth of Bitcoin


Not long after he touted Bitcoin (BTC) as the only acceptable monetary and investment choice, social media personality and former professional kickboxer Andrew Tate announced he would completely abandon fiat money and purchase more than $100 million worth of the maiden cryptocurrency.
Specifically, Tate voiced his disillusionment with traditional banks, their financial practices, and what he perceives as fraudulent schemes, announcing his intention to transition entirely from fiat currency to Bitcoin and plans to invest over $100 million into BTC, as shared in his X post on May 15.

As the popular influencer further explained, he hasn’t done this yet because he actually had “more crypto than fiat” in his possession, but added that “I think I’ll just leave fiat completely,” which he earlier referred to as a “fiat ponzi scam cash that you self enslave to earn.”


Andrew Tate Twitter lessons
Indeed, many know Tate as a big fan of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, having declared in late April the end of the United States dollar, along with real estate and many other investments, which the government might take away from their holders, leaving Bitcoin as the only option.
On top of that, he had indicated plans to buy $10 million worth of Bitcoin, adding up to the ‘Top G’s’ estimated net wealth in the range between $4 million and $12 million, most of which comes from the cars that he owns together with his brother Tristan Tate, as Finbold reported on April 3.
Additionally, the former kickboxer has claimed to have earned around $85 million from “Defi land” during the previous bull run, as well as stated that he purchased his first Bitcoin in 2018 and has been buying some “every single week without fail” ever since (which means even when he was in jail in Romania).
Meanwhile, the price of the largest asset in the crypto market at press time stood at $66,179, marking a recovery in the amount of 6.43% in the last 24 hours, adding up to the weekly advance of 8.27% and accumulating a 4% increase on its monthly chart, as per data on May 16.

Donald Trump Is 'First Crypto President': Former CFTC Regulator

                        Former President Donald Trump has been dubbed “America’s first crypto president” ever since his first year in office in 2017, according to Chris Giancarlo, a former CFTC regulator. This designation came about when his administration approved the introduction of Bitcoin futures contracts, he said.Giancarlo, speaking at a Washington DC crypto policy event on Wednesday, highlighted Trump’s supposedly long-standing reputation in the crypto industry, FFox Business reported. The ex-official’s comments come after Trump last week pledged to end cryptocurrency hostility if re-elected.“In addition to announcing he’s now ‘good with it’ — crypto, that is — Trump may justifiably claim to be ‘America’s first crypto president,’” Giancarlo said. “That is because of the launch of regulation Bitcoin futures in the first year of the Trump presidency.”“The enduring success of that regulated futures marketplace has helped ensure that the world’s first digital commodity — Bitcoin — is priced in US dollars,” he added.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launched its Bitcoin futures trading in 2017, joining CBOE among the first exchanges to offer this new financial instrument.Crypto’s Political Trajectory in US Elections
Trump’s time as the 45th US president commenced with his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017, and concluded on Jan. 20, 2021. According to Giancarlo, cryptocurrency was not a politicized issue in 2017. At the time, he along with fellow CFTC commissioners were “unified in support of regulatory innovation.”But now, seven years down the line, crypto is on the brink of becoming a political focal point for the first time in a presidential election.Donald Trump’s Changing Views on Crypto
Before becoming a crypto advocate, Trump voiced strong criticism in July 2019. He labeled them “not money” and slammed their volatility and lack of inherent value. Additionally, he raised concerns about their potential use in criminal activities such as drug trafficking.Some in the industry worry about Biden’s stance on crypto, while others hope for favorable legislation under his administration. Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, criticized Biden for hindering the crypto industry, citing regulatory uncertainties. On the contrary, Kyle Bligen from the Chamber of Progress sees potential for positive crypto laws if Biden is re-elected.Under Biden, the SEC and the CFTC have fought over crypto industry jurisdiction. Congress struggles with bipartisan legislation to resolve the issue. Meanwhile, courts grapple with whether digital assets should be commodities or securities.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Creator Breaks Silence on Ethereum ETF


In a recent social media discussion, Dogecoin co-author Billy Markus gave his opinion on the upcoming SEC decision regarding Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds. Responding to a skeptical post about the fate of ETH ETFs, Markus expressed an equally pessimistic stance, implying that the current "compromised" state of the regulator holds little good for potential approval. This statement from Markus comes amid heightened expectations surrounding Ethereum's legal position as part of the SEC's ETF discussions. Financial lawyer Scott Johnsson recently opined that Ethereum's legal classification will figure prominently in the upcoming ETF decisions. He noted the regulator's reluctance to approve commodity trust shares for Ethereum, citing concerns about its securities-like nature, something Bitcoin ETFs have not faced.Current situation for Ethereum ETFsThe imminent decision dates for VanEck and ARK Invest's applications for Ethereum ETFs, set for May 23 and May 24, respectively, which is already a week away, has intensified speculation in the crypto industry. Despite expectations of a rejection due to Ethereum's alleged regulatory failure, the exact basis for the SEC's potential rejection remains unclear.Markus's remarks add to the skepticism surrounding the prospects of Ethereum ETFs, reflecting the broader sentiment in the cryptocurrency community regarding regulatory obstacles.There are still unanswered questions about the extent to which regulatory barriers will prevent the mass adoption of Ethereum and altcoins, and whether there will be alternative investment opportunities. There are also ongoing debates about the effectiveness and fairness of the regulatory framework, with supporters arguing for clearer guidelines and opponents criticizing excessive regulatory overreach.

                        Crypto custody firm Bakkt expects a significant increase in the involvement of institutional investors in the cryptocurrency trading market.The driving force behind this mainstream adoption, according to Bakkt, is the recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The firm made the prediction on Wednesday when announcing its latest quarterly results, according to a report from PYMNTS.Bakkt Sees Surge in Crypto Trading Volume
In the first quarter ending on March 31, Bakkt witnessed a remarkable 324% surge in crypto trading volume compared to the previous quarter, primarily fueled by robust client trading activity.The positive trend indicates a growing demand environment, with increased industry activity, higher coin prices, and overall elevated retail trading volume, as stated by Andy Main, President and CEO of Bakkt, during the company’s quarterly earnings call.The existing crypto trading market was primarily tailored for retail investors, utilizing a central limit order book trading structure.However, institutional investors seeking to offer Bitcoin ETFs have found that this structure fails to meet their large-scale requirements.Recognizing this need, Bakkt plans to seize the opportunity by developing BakktX, an electronic communication network (ECN) designed as a purpose-built crypto trading venue for institutions.BakktX aims to provide high performance, low latency, and cost-effective solutions.BakktX to Facilitate Real-Time Execution
The proposed BakktX trading venue will facilitate real-time execution of trades, leveraging Bakkt’s extensive network of liquidity relationships.It will also feature a low fee structure, incentivizing trading volumes and catering to the demands of institutional investors.The company believes that this enhancement in trading technology will strengthen existing relationships and attract new clients who prioritize top-tier infrastructure providers.In addition to the launch of BakktX, the company plans to expand its product offerings and solutions while focusing on broadening its client network, deepening existing relationships, and continuously improving its cost structure throughout 2024.To streamline operations and drive profitability, Bakkt recently implemented a restructuring initiative, reducing its headcount by 20%.This strategic move is expected to result in $7 million in cash savings for 2024 and $13 million in annualized cash savings.The decisions made by Bakkt reflect its determination to navigate the challenging landscape and reallocate resources to growth areas.By capitalizing on the increasing interest of institutional investors and delivering a purpose-built trading platform, Bakkt aims to solidify its position as a key player in the evolving crypto trading market.As reported, trading volume on major cryptocurrency exchanges has experienced a significant decline in April, coinciding with Bitcoin’s retreat from its all-time high.Additionally, derivatives trading volume saw its first decrease in seven months, falling by 26.1% to $4.57 trillion.The decline came as major CEXs like Binance experienced a large surge in trading volumes between October 2023 and March 2024.

Hedera (HBAR) New Account Creation Booms, Token Gets Boosted | Cryptopolitan

Hedera (HBAR) is rising after a spike in new account creation. The overall market recovery lifted HBAR, but the asset also reflects the organic growth of the Hedera project. The Hedera network is growing its transaction count and active addresses. The growth is long term and mostly driven by DeFi. However, in the short term, Hedera users also noted a sudden spike in new address generation.  Active wallets on the Hedera network grew mainly because of DeFi projects, and there was also some growth from NFT owners in the past two quarters. Hedera’s new address creation is a somewhat involved process, where enterprises can create up to 100 wallets in a batch using BitGo. Hedera Expands with DeFi AdditionsIn the past few months, alternative platforms, and blockchains benefitted the most from the return of DeFi. Hedera hosts several decentralized markets and lending protocols, including those that expanded to multiple chains, such as Pangolin DEX. Hedera still has limited value locked to DeFi, but growth happened just about six months ago. Decentralized trading and liquidity mining are among the factors that put the project in the spotlight, unlike its long-term goals and ambitions for global influence in payment systems and finance. Recently, Hedera announced a partnership with like-minded projects that plan to disrupt finance. Hedera will work with Algorand, Ripple, XRPL Labs, Constellation, and Casper to create the Decentralized Recovery Alliance (DeRec).Hedera Aims to Grow Real-world ApplicationsHedera undeniably benefitted from the return of DeFi and the 2024 bull market. However, the project has long-term goals and tries to aggressively grow its use cases. One tool for applying Hedera technology is a new Beta program for app developers. Recently, Hedera approved a new batch of projects, including Vayana Official, Inveniam, and FreshSupply. The selected projects will boost the adoption of blockchain-based finance. All projects work on the intersection of traditional payments and tokenization. Hedera’s other development direction is the Internet of Things (IoT). In the crypto space, IoT projects have been considered mostly vaporware. Hedera has the technology to carry a high load of microtransactions and is designed similarly to IOTA and other graph-based networks. Hedera also mentioned the Neuron World Beta program, where developers can create and try out sensors for everyday objects. Neuron World is an open-source project, seeking teams to apply physical IoT infrastructure. With this new source of data and micro-transactions, Hedera has a claim on DePIN status, as well as real-world microtransactions. The Hedera network now has 32 known nodes, which stake 22B HBAR tokens during predetermined periods. The network distributes worldwide, but many of the nodes, including the node run by BitGo and Chainlink, have their base in the USA. Is HBAR Heading for a Longer Price Rally?Hedera has always attempted to boost its community and remain highly visible. The growth of DeFi on the network helped HBAR move up from its bear market lows. HBAR traded at $0.11, bouncing from lows of $0.09, but still far from the monthly peak at $0.17. HBAR is relatively volatile and may touch the lower monthly range again, but traders are expecting the next breakout. HBAR is still under its 200-day moving average, but traders suggest the token may have reached its low point in the short term. HBAR trades on low volumes of just under $100M per day, but activity has expanded to $3.5B daily during active trading. The expectations are that Hedera will line up among blue-chip projects during this market cycle. HBAR is already more visible in the top 30 coins and tokens and may break out higher up the charts. HBAR also showed signs of accumulation in the past weeks, and is considered a token with a significant upside, to potentially achieve 10X growth in the event of a new altcoin bull rally.Cryptopolitan reporting by Hristina Vasileva

XRP Investors Beware: SEC Appeal Threatens Post-Court Victory


							

XRP’s gains trail behind broader market rally amidst looming Ripple lawsuit.



Court to determine penalty for Ripple’s alleged violation as SEC seeks fines.



Potential SEC appeal could restrict XRP sales to institutions.




The XRP market is currently experiencing a holding pattern, balancing recent gains with the looming uncertainty of the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple. While XRP managed a 3.63% gain on Wednesday, May 15th, it lagged behind the broader crypto market’s impressive 6.38% surge, which was driven by positive US economic data.



The lack of updates on Ripple’s Motion to Seal case documents was not unexpected, but the real tension lies0 in what comes next. The court will soon deliberate on the penalty for Ripple’s alleged securities violation and decide on a potential sales ban on XRP. This ban, coupled with the hefty $2 billion penalty the SEC, has the investors on edge. 







SourceL TradingView



Technically, XRP’s price action indicates it is currently stagnant. Key technical indicators suggest range-bound trading, with a potential breakout or breakdown dependent on upcoming events.



However, the most significant factor influencing XRP’s future remains the SEC lawsuit. Upcoming U.S. economic data and Federal Open Market Committee announcements will also play a crucial role. Investors are keenly awaiting any developments in the Ripple case, particularly regarding the court’s ruling and the potential SEC appeal.









Popular crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto, known for his XRP insights, recently shared a forecast regarding XRP’s “Super Guppy Cycle Top” expected in September 2024. EGRAG’s analysis compares the current cycle to past patterns, offering projections and potential insights into XRP’s trajectory over the coming months. The Super Guppy indicator is a group of Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) that signal changes in price action.

That's 8.3% higher than it was this time last week. The past day has seen $82 billion worth of BTC change hands, according to Coinglass.Bitcoin has been helped along by signs that inflation in the U.S. has started to wane. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released new data showing that consumer prices had fallen for the first time in six months. That's good news for risk-on investors who trade cryptocurrency and stocks.

Bitcoin (BTC) Prices Could Hit Highs of $74K as Selling Pressure Eases, Traders Say

A breakout in bitcoin comes after weeks of low volatility. Since March, the market has been range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000, with the halving event in April not providing the expected boost due to a general lack of market catalysts, traders have previously said.

NFT Market Crashes: 95% Of Assets Become Worthless


								The once-feverish NFT marketplace, where digital art and collectibles commanded millions, now resembles a deserted online bazaar. A new report paints a stark picture – a 97% plunge in trading volume since 2021 and a staggering 95% of NFT projects holding zero market value.
This dramatic decline begs the question: is the NFT market headed for extinction, or is this just a temporary hiccup?

From Jpeg Millionaires To Tumbleweed Sales
Just two years ago, NFTs were the new gold rush. Beeple’s $69 million digital collage sale became a cultural phenomenon, and stories of overnight millionaires from “on-chain jpegs” fueled a speculative frenzy. However, that frenzy seems to have fizzled out.
Today, the average NFT sale struggles to break the $200 mark, a far cry from the seven-figure sums of yesteryear. Daily sales have nosedived from a bustling 87,000 in 2021 to a mere 2,000 in 2024.

Crypto Winter And Beyond: A Cocktail Of Challenges
The blame for this downturn falls on several factors. The broader crypto market slump, often referred to as the “crypto winter,” has undoubtedly played a role. Economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions haven’t helped either, dampening investor confidence.
However, the NFT market’s woes may run deeper. Critics point to a saturation of low-quality projects and a lack of utility for many NFTs beyond bragging rights. The multi-million dollar sales of 2021 might have been outliers, fueled by hype rather than genuine value.

A Glimmer Of Hope? Retail Investors Hold The Key
Despite the bleak landscape, the report suggests a potential comeback. The authors point to historical trends in the crypto market, where periods of decline have often been followed by resurgence.
A return of retail investors, those willing to take on higher risk for potentially high rewards, could breathe new life into the market. This hinges on a recovery in the broader market and a renewed sense of optimism among investors.
Total crypto market cap currently at $2.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView
Regulation: A Looming Cloud
The future of NFTs isn’t without its hurdles. Regulatory scrutiny from the US government casts a long shadow. While some argue that clear regulations could bring stability and legitimacy to the market, others fear it could stifle innovation. Finding the right balance between protecting investors and fostering growth will be crucial for the NFT market’s future.

The Verdict: A Time Of Reckoning
We can view the current status of the NFT market as a reckoning era. The gaudy dreams of 2021 have made way for a more grounded reality. It will be interesting to watch if NFTs develop into a strong asset class with practical applications or if they become just another digital memory.

Shiba Inu Soars: ShibaSwap Launch on Shibarium Boosts EcosystemWriter: Anisha Pandey


							

Shiba Inu ecosystem expands with ShibaSwap launch on Shibarium, its Layer-2 solution



Shiba Inu token poised for potential growth



Shibarium emerges as a DeFi contender




Shiba Inu (SHIB) enthusiasts are celebrating the launch of ShibaSwap on Shibarium, the project’s much-anticipated Layer-2 scaling solution. This marks a significant milestone for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, unlocking new functionalities and potentially boosting the value of the SHIB token.







ShibaSwap’s migration to Shibarium news signifies a major step forward for Shiba Inu. It expands the project’s reach beyond the Ethereum network, establishing Shibarium as a key player in the DeFi landscape. Notably, ShibaSwap becomes the first major decentralized application (dApp) built on Shibarium, serving as a flagship platform to demonstrate the network’s capabilities.



Through ShibaSwap, users gain access to a wider range of features. This includes creating liquidity pools (LPs) directly on Shibarium, enabling seamless token swaps between the Layer-2 network and Ethereum. Additionally, users can stake their SHIB tokens on ShibaSwap, providing crucial support for the overall Shiba Inu ecosystem.



The integration of ShibaSwap with Shibarium is expected to fuel a rise in network transactions. This, in turn, could accelerate the rate of SHIB token burning. According to data from Shibburn, the burn rate for SHIB skyrocketed by 306% within a 24-hour period ending at 11:57 p.m. ET on Wednesday.









SHIB, the native token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, is poised to benefit considerably from this development. Increased staking opportunities with associated rewards are expected to drive demand for SHIB, potentially creating a positive feedback loop that fuels token burning and potentially increases its value.Data from CoinMarketCap indicates a near 10% surge in SHIB’s price, currently sitting at $0.00002518 with a corresponding 24.85% increase in trading volume. The market capitalization of the meme coin now stands at $14.84 billion.

Binance develops ‘antidote’ to address poisoning scams after $68M exploit

Binance’s security experts developed an “antidote” against the growing instances of address poisoning scams, that trick investors into willingly sending funds to a fraudulent address.The security team of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange developed an algorithm that detected millions of poisoned crypto addresses, according to a report shared with Cointelegraph:“We have developed a unique method of identifying poisoned addresses, which helps us to alert users before they send money to criminals and was instrumental in identifying and flagging more than 13.4 million spoofed addresses on BNB Smart Chain and 1.68 million on Ethereum.”Address poisoning, or address spoofing, is a deception trick where scammers send a small amount of digital assets to a wallet that closely resembles the potential victim’s address, to make it part of the wallet’s transaction history — hoping that the victim will accidentally copy and send funds to their address.Binance’s algorithm detects spoofed addresses by first identifying suspicious transfers, such as those with near zero value or unknown tokens, pairing them with potential victim addresses, and timestamping malicious transactions to find the potential point of poisoning.The spoofed addresses are registered in the database of Web3 security firm HashDit, Binance’s security partner, which will help protect the wider crypto industry from poisoning scams, according to Binance’s report.“Many cryptocurrency service providers use HashDit’s API to boost their defenses against a variety of scams. One of them, for example, is Trust Wallet, which uses the database of poisoned addresses to alert users when they are about to transfer funds to a spoofed recipient.”The algorithm will also help flag spoofed addresses on HashDit’s user-facing products, web browser extensions, and MetaMask Snaps.Related: Post-FTX crypto industry needs education before regulation — Former Biden adviserAddress poisoning is a growing concern following $68 million scamThe necessity for a preventive algorithm became apparent two weeks ago, after an unknown trader lost $68 million to an address-poisoning scam. They accidentally sent $68 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) in a single transaction to a spoofed address on May 3.In a fortunate but mysterious turn of events, the thief returned the $68 million on May 13, after numerous on-chain investigators started shedding light on his potential Hong Kong-based IP addresses. This suggests that the scammer wasn’t a white hat hacker, but a thief that became scared of the public attention following the scam.Address poisoning scams may seem easily avoidable, but most traders only verify the first and last digits of the wallet’s 42 alphanumeric characters, as most protocols only display the first and last digits.Making matters more difficult, scammers rely on vanity address generators to customize their addresses to seem less random or more similar to a given address, according to Binance.“An authentic Ethereum address like 0x19x30f…62657 could be spoofed using a similar-looking 0x19x30t…72657, which can be totally different in the middle while maintaining the first and last few characters.”VIDEOScammers, WATCH OUT!

Market expert sets Bitcoin price for August 2024


Bitcoin (BTC) is once again flirting with the possibility of reclaiming a new record after successfully breaching the $65,000 resistance mark.
As the maiden cryptocurrency seemingly benefits from the euphoria around the latest United States inflation data, technical indicators suggest that a new record high for Bitcoin is on the horizon.
Particularly, in a TradingView post on May 16, crypto trading expert TradingShot suggested that Bitcoin might be in line to clinch the $150,000 target by August 2024. 


The analyst pointed out that Bitcoin has shown signs of resurgence, buoyed by a recent 25% correction which the expert deemed as normal within bull cycles. 
TradingShot also observed that Bitcoin had closed above the one-day moving average 50 (MA50) after two consecutive rejections, indicating that Bitcoin’s upward trajectory seems promising.

The trading expert also reviewed Bitcoin’s long-term chart, particularly the one-week timeframe, where the crypto appears to be at a cyclical stage. Historically, during similar cycles, Bitcoin has embarked on its most aggressive rallies. 
Technical levels to watch out for 
Therefore, TradingShot stated that Bitcoin’s recent bounce on the exponential moving average (EMA) ribbon, coupled with its recovery of the mayer multiple SD1, indicates positive momentum.  
Drawing from these indicators, the analysts suggested that Bitcoin’s next target could be $150,000 by August. 

“As you can see, BTC rebounded on the EMA Ribbon, after making a new All Time High (ATH) while also recovering the Mayer Multiple SD1 from above. When those parameters got met in the past, Bitcoin always touched at least the MMB SD2 from above. Based on that, the next Target on this run is $150,000,” the expert said. 

Bitcoin’s breakout inevitable 
On the other hand, another crypto expert, Michaël van de Poppe, suggested in a May 16 post on X (formerly Twitter) that an upwards trajectory for Bitcoin was inevitable based on its recent recovery.
He noted that Bitcoin’s steady rise would instill renewed confidence in the cryptocurrency markets. As Bitcoin continues its ascent, Poppe suggested that attention is shifting to altcoins, which are expected to benefit significantly from this positive market sentiment.

It’s worth noting that renewed interest in BTC comes after the latest inflation figures were released. According to the data, the core inflation rate fell to 3.8% year-on-year, its lowest level in three years.
These figures have ignited speculation that the Federal Reserve might finally enact an interest rate cut, with some market participants projecting that the cut might come as early as July.
In the meantime, the flagship digital asset continues to be buoyed by several bullish elements likely to sustain its momentum. For instance, CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, is reportedly planning to unveil Bitcoin trading to capitalize on the growing interest in the asset by Wall Street.
Bitcoin price analysis
By press time, Bitcoin price today is trading at $66,270 with daily gains of almost 6%. On the weekly timeframe, BTC is up 8%.

Having breached the $65,000 resistance, Bitcoin is well-positioned to reach the $70,000 mark en route to a new all-time high. This trajectory will be aided if the historical post-halving rally kicks in.

Swiss Federal Council seeks public input on global crypto tax standards

The Swiss Federal Council has recently urged a public consultation to bring into effect international reporting conduct for crypto tax and ensure equal treatment of crypto assets, which is generally at par with traditional financial assets. The Federal Council’s proposal implies the introduction of a Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) to ensure tax transparency in Switzerland.Swiss Federal Council pushes for crypto tax rulesThe Federal Government Council, or the Swiss government, which has 7 members, released a consultation paper on May 15 to discover the private will that Switzerland can actively take part in the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI). AEOI is adopted by member countries as a measure of collaboration among tax administrations to curb tax evasion. Instead of Switzerland’s entry into AEOI planned for January, 1st, 2026 is the country’s extension up to the date. This step is subsequent to the fact that Switzerland accessed the OECD’s standard CRS(Common Reporting Standard) in 2014, which excluded CARF at the initial stage.The introduction of CARF will enhance Swiss comprehensive crypto sympathetic market regulation and contribute to maintaining country’s financial establishment dignity. Nevertheless, the Parliament will have to be involved, and the CARF adoption must include more than just the answers to the suggested criteria in the consultation paper. This development is just one of the many different things Switzerland is doing in order to improve tax transparency and make sure all the financial assets are treated in the same fairway.CARF guidelines to shape Swiss regulationThe OECD launched the AEOI and other initiatives, which were later completed for the G20 countries, who now joined other countries in it. In 2027, 49 countries are estimated to have fully implemented the CARF rules to put a pre-emptive measure in place for fraud and increase fiscal transparency. The fact that this collaboration requires the use of the same reporting standards for crypto assets and the traditional types of financial assets is proof that there is a need for standardization.The Swiss federal authority tries to level financial institutions and overcome the transparency gaps related to both traditional assets and financial professionals. This consultation period extends till September 6 and aims to get the opinions of all the major stakeholders, including the financial institutions, the crypto asset service platforms, and everybody else. The result of this conversation will be a guideline for the crypto asset regulation in Switzerland as well as its adherence to international standards.Canada and Switzerland to adopt CARFThe introduction of CARF will introduce new reporting requirements that will be obligatory to the service providers of crypto assets. Those service providers will be for example crypto-exchange platforms, brokerage firms or automated teller machine operators. Due to the necessity of reporting the activity on crypto assets along with fiat currency, they will account for any transactions between different cryptos. In turn, these increased level of reporting aims to introduce transparency to the sector and to steer tax evasion and money laundering away.In April 2024, the budget for the Canadian Year asking the country to create CarF for taxing by 2026. This goes onto show that the increased adoption of this reporting framework is actually a footprint in the pathway to standardisation of reporting for crypto assets among the nations. Countries like Canada and Switzerland are aiming for the implementation of CARF, thus, bringing about a globalized platform of deployment regulatory issue comparisons and a more transparent cryptocurrency asset regulation.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin rebounded strongly, surpassing $65,930 and reaching a peak of $66,591 on Thursday. Softer-than-anticipated U.S. inflation data fueled this rally by increasing the likelihood of interest rate cuts and boosting investor confidence across the crypto market.As Bitcoin climbed, it catalyzed gains across other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Ripple, pushing the global cryptocurrency market cap to $2.39 trillion, a 24-hour surge of more than 5%.Adding to the positive market dynamics, Millennium Management, a prominent hedge fund, has significantly invested in Bitcoin ETFs, holding nearly $2 billion in assets, underscoring strong institutional support for Bitcoin.Millennium Management Leads in Bitcoin ETF Investments with Nearly $2 Billion Holdings
Millennium Management, an international hedge fund, has made a substantial investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs, holding nearly $2 billion as of the first quarter of 2024. According to their latest 13F filing with the SEC, Millennium’s investment spread across five prominent ETFs totaled approximately $1.94 billion by March 31.These investments were diversified among several key products, including the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, iShares Bitcoin Trust, and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF.
Largest Holdings: BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund, with over $844 million, and Fidelity’s fund, closely following at just over $806 million.
Market Impact: Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas highlighted Millennium as having 200 times the exposure of typical new ETF investors.
The significant engagement of professional investors like Millennium suggests a robust institutional interest in Bitcoin, reinforcing a positive outlook for its future. Matt Hougan of Bitwise has expressed optimism, noting that the scale of professional investment might lead to a combined AUM nearing $5 billion. This trend underscores the growing acceptance of Bitcoin among seasoned investors, enhancing its profile in the investment community.BTC Rises Above $66,000 Amid Expectations of Potential Rate Cuts on Softer US Inflation Data
Bitcoin surged above $66,000 yesterday, achieving its highest single-day gain in nearly two months. The most recent US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which showed a slower inflation rate of 0.3% month-over-month for April, below the anticipated 0.4%, was the driving force behind this significant uptrend. This unexpected slowdown heightened investor expectations for potential rate cuts. Meanwhile, Retail Sales for the same period remained stagnant, further underscoring economic softness and bolstering the case for monetary easing.
Core PPI rose by 0.5% month-over-month, surpassing expectations.
Softer CPI and stalled retail sales have increased optimism for potential rate cuts.
This amalgam of economic indicators has sparked a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, as softer inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy sooner.Bitcoin ETFs See Record Inflows, Driving BTC Price Surge to $66,000
On May 15, Bitcoin ETFs in the United States experienced a significant boost in inflows, totaling $303 million, the largest since early March. This influx was led by Fidelity’s FBTC fund, which attracted $131 million, and Bitwise’s BITB fund, receiving $86 million. Notably, Millennium Management is the largest institutional holder in this space with an investment totaling $2 billion across various Bitcoin ETFs.
Top Fund Inflows: Fidelity’s FBTC ($131 million) and Bitwise’s BITB ($86 million).
Key Driver: Bitcoin’s 7% price increase to $66,000, spurred by US inflation data suggesting potential rate cuts.
This remarkable inflow into Bitcoin ETFs, combined with favorable economic indicators, has significantly bolstered Bitcoin’s market value, pushing its price to $66,000. This trend underscores the growing investor confidence in cryptocurrencies as a viable investment amid shifting economic conditions.
Bitcoin Price Prediction

With a bearish Bitcoin price prediction, BTC is experiencing a slight downturn, trading at $65,930, marking a 0.44% decrease. The cryptocurrency is hovering just below its pivotal point of $66,260, a critical juncture that could determine the next directional move. 
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is elevated at 74, indicating that BTC is possibly overbought, which might precede a pullback if bullish momentum does not sustain.
Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: Tradingview
Immediate support and resistance levels are crucial to watch. The first significant resistance lies at $67,820, with subsequent barriers at $69,084 and $70,643. A push above these levels could signal a strong bullish continuation. Conversely, support levels are set at $64,732, followed by $63,438 and $61,438. A breach below these could confirm a bearish trend, especially if the price falls beneath the pivot point.
The 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $62,687, further supporting the idea that the mid-term trend has been bullish, but caution is warranted given the current RSI levels.
Current Trend: Cautiously bearish unless BTC decisively clears the $66,260 pivot point.

Deere & Co. Q2 Earnings Top Forecasts, But Shares Dip on Lowered Outlook - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Deere & Co. (NYSE: DE), a leading agricultural equipment manufacturer, reported strong second-quarter earnings on Thursday, May 16, 2024. The company’s earnings per share (EPS) and revenue surpassed analyst expectations. However, it lowered its full-year net income forecast due to declining crop prices and reduced demand for its products.



Deere & Co. Tops EPS and Revenue Forecasts in Q1, Lowers 2024 Outlook



Deere & Co. reported Q2 EPS of $8.53, beating the analyst estimate of $7.87 by $0.66. The company’s revenue for the quarter reached $15.24 billion, exceeding the consensus estimate of $13.3 billion. Despite the strong quarterly performance, Deere revised its full-year net income forecast downward to approximately $7.0 billion, from the previous forecast of $7.5 to $7.75 billion.



The company attributed the revised outlook to declining crop prices and reduced demand for tractors and combine harvesters. The U.S. Department of Agriculture projected a 25.5% decline in net farm income to $116.1 billion for the year, driven by a drop in corn and soybean prices to over three-year lows. Higher interest rates have also pressured farmers, leading to increased inventories of agricultural equipment and forcing Deere and other manufacturers to cut production. As a result, Deere expects sales of large agricultural equipment to decline between 20% and 25% this year, an adjustment from the earlier expectation of a roughly 20% fall.





Deere & Co. Shares Drop on Lowered 2024 Outlook



Deere & Co. closed at $414.02 on May 15, 2024, reflecting a slight increase of 0.30%. However, in pre-market trading today, the stock was down 6.50%, trading at $387.10 at the time of writing.The 52-week range for Deere’s stock was $321.85 to $446.76, and the company’s market cap stood at $115.25 billion as of the latest close.



The company’s trailing P/E ratio is 12.07, with a forward P/E ratio of 15.53. Key profitability metrics include a profit margin of 16.39%, return on assets (ROA) of 9.90%, and return on equity (ROE) of 45.61%. Deere’s total revenue (ttm) was $60.76 billion, with net income attributable to common shareholders at $9.96 billion, and diluted EPS (ttm) at $34.32.



Deere’s total cash (mrq) was $3.83 billion, and the company’s total debt/equity ratio was 289.24%. Analyst price targets for Deere’s stock range from a low of $365.00 to a high of $495.00.

FTX Bankruptcy Update: Major Claim Transferred to Single Creditor, Simplifying Case but Risking Smaller Parties



                    

In the latest twist in the FTX bankruptcy saga, a significant claim previously held against FTX EU—renamed from K-DNA Financial Services—has been assigned to a single creditor, named FTXcreditor, according to court documents from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware dated May 15. 



This move forms part of the ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings involving FTX and could potentially streamline the process, albeit introducing new risks for smaller creditors involved.




The transfer adheres to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, specifically Rule 3001(e)(2). 



This rule pertains to the transfer of claims, and in this context, the documents state: “Seller hereby waives any notice or hearing requirements imposed by Rule 3001 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, and stipulates that an order may be entered recognizing this Evidence of Transfer of Claim as an unconditional assignment and Buyer as the valid owner of the claim.” 



This statement underscores the legal basis for the transfer and the elimination of typical procedural requirements to expedite the process.




This strategic consolidation aims to reduce the administrative burden of managing multiple claims by channeling them through a single creditor. 



While this could speed up the resolution of the case, it also poses significant concerns for smaller creditors.

With all claims funneled through one entity, there is a risk that these smaller parties may be marginalized, potentially receiving lesser or less favorable settlements compared to larger creditors.




The identity of the transferring party remains undisclosed, adding a layer of opacity to the proceedings. 



The official statement regarding this anonymity notes, “To protect the identity of the Transferor, Transferee has not disclosed the Transferor’s name or address, and has not attached the signed Evidence of Transfer to this Notice of Transfer of Claim.” 



This lack of transparency could lead to speculation and concerns about the fairness and integrity of the bankruptcy process, especially in terms of potential for manipulation.



The backdrop to these developments is the dramatic downfall of FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 after a sudden financial collapse. 



The fallout continues to affect numerous creditors and has prompted tighter regulatory scrutiny over the cryptocurrency industry in the United States, aiming to enhance investor protection.



Adding to the ongoing drama, FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried recently reiterated his innocence following a 25-year prison sentence. 



In a May 9 interview, he shared insights into his prison life, focusing on his basic diet and mentioning that rice had become “one of the currencies of the realm inside,” illustrating the stark change in his circumstances.

Shiba Inu: ShibaSwap Debuts On Shibarium, Features Revealed


								ShibaSwap, the native decentralized exchange (DEX) of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has officially launched on Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 scaling solution. This strategic move was announced via X, signifying a major step forward in leveraging the scalability and cost-efficiency of Shibarium while maintaining the security features of the Ethereum blockchain.
The SHIB army received this news with the following statement from the Shiba Inu team via X: “ShibArmy the wait is finally over — ShibaSwap is coming home to Shibarium! ShibaSwap is more than just an exchange; it’s where our community’s spirit meets innovation, where your community tokens not only exist but thrive.”
Shiba Inu’s DeFi Ecosystem Makes A Giant Leap Forward
The integration of ShibaSwap onto Shibarium is not just a mere transition; it is a transformative shift that establishes ShibaSwap as a multi-chain DEX now operating on both Ethereum and Shibarium, according to the latest issue of SHIB Magazine. This dual-chain approach optimizes user benefits by combining the robust security of Ethereum with the enhanced scalability and reduced transaction costs offered by Shibarium.

A central feature of this integration is the enhanced ability for users to directly influence the exchange’s ecosystem by creating new liquidity pools for their preferred tokens. This move significantly enhances the decentralized nature of the platform, allowing for greater community participation and influence in shaping the ecosystem’s growth.
“Adding liquidity to ShibaSwap’s pools empowers you to participate in decentralized trading while earning fees with ease. While setting up a liquidity pool on Ethereum can cost around $100 or more, doing so on Shibarium typically costs less than $1, making it an attractive option for users seeking to participate in DeFi without breaking the bank,” the SHIB team explained.
In addition to technical upgrades, ShibaSwap has introduced substantial improvements to its user interface and overall user experience. The redesigned dashboard and simplified user interface are aimed at enhancing the trading and yield farming experience for all users, regardless of their level of expertise in the DeFi space. This redesign makes navigation and operation within ShibaSwap more intuitive, facilitating smoother interactions with the platform’s various features.

The platform now includes advanced features such as trend analysis charts, which allow users to spot trending tokens by volume and trading activities. The newly integrated analytics display provides users with real-time data on ShibaSwap’s total value locked (TVL) and trading volume, enhancing their ability to make informed trading decisions.
The increased transaction volume on Shibarium not only promises more fees for liquidity providers and stakers but also supports a higher burn rate of the SHIB token through the burning of base gas fees. This dynamic serves a dual purpose: rewarding users for their participation and investment in the ecosystem and simultaneously reducing the overall supply of SHIB, potentially increasing its scarcity and value.
Commenting on the future of ShibSwap in the SHIB Magazine, the dev team revealed that the DEX “is poised for even greater advancements with the upcoming V2 and V3 releases,” which will introduce a range of new features designed to further enhance user experience. These include extended user interfaces, more concentrated liquidity management tools, and customizable price ranges.
All enhancements aim to improve rewards for liquidity providers, enhance portfolio management, and optimize overall liquidity performance.
At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00002550.

Fraud and Money Laundering: Canadian Crypto King and Associate Charged


							

Aiden Pleterski and aide Colin Murphy charged with money laundering



The charges followed a joint investigation by Canada’s DRPS and OSC.



OSC advises the public to scrutinize individuals offering investment advice




Canadian authorities have charged Aiden Pleterski, a self-proclaimed “Crypto King” residing in Whitby, Ontario, and his associate, Colin Murphy of Oshawa, Ontario, with fraud and money laundering offenses. The charges stem from a joint investigation – Project Swan – conducted by the Durham Regional Police Service (DRPS) and the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC).



Pleterski faces the most serious allegations, including violating a court order (pursuant to subsection 517(1) of the Criminal Code) issued on May 14, 2024. He is also charged with one count of fraud exceeding $5,000 (Section 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code) and one count of laundering proceeds of crime (Section 462.31(1)(a) of the Criminal Code). Pleterski remains in custody pending a bail hearing.









Murphy, the second suspect, is charged with a single count of fraud exceeding $5,000. Unlike Pleterski, he was released after signing an undertaking, a legal promise to appear in court.  The OSC issued a public advisory urging investors solicited by the suspects to contact the commission. The regulator expressed gratitude to those who have already provided information to aid the ongoing investigation.The OSC’s Enforcement Branch and the DRPS Financial Crimes Unit led the investigation, with assistance from the Toronto Police Service, York Regional Police, and FINTRAC. Both the OSC and DRPS emphasized investor protection. They advise the public to exercise caution when approached with investment opportunities or financial advice. The authorities recommend using the  “Check Before You Invest” and “Registered crypto asset trading platforms” pages of their websites to verify the registration status of investment vendors.

South Korean Crypto Market Soars to $32.4B as Bitcoin Recovers to $66,000 | Coinspeaker



In addition to the increased daily trading activities in South Korea, local crypto exchanges also experienced growth in user base well ahead of the global crypto surge that pushed prices to unprecedented levels in early 2024.

The South Korean crypto market has experienced significant growth over the past year, reaching a new  height of  $32.4 billion. The surge was driven by increased interest in the digital asset industry, particularly Bitcoin (BTC), which reached $73,000 in March following a two-year rebound.
Despite the crypto asset dipping below $57,000 in April and now climbing back to $66,000, it did not deter investors from engaging with the emerging economy.




South Korean Crypto Market Hits New Milestone
According to reports citing an annual survey detailing the state of the virtual asset market during the latter half of 2023, the market capitalization of South Korean virtual assets sector surged by an astonishing 43.6 trillion won ($32.4 billion).
However, this figure was only generated from licenced exchanges in the country such as Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit and Gopax. In the last six months of 2023 alone, these companies recorded a 53% increase in market capitalization equivalent to $11.2 billion, compared to the first half of the year.
The survey findings was released on May 16 by the South Korean Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU), a division of the Financial Services Commission. The data were collected from 22 local exchanges and 7 wallet and custodial service providers in the country.
The study found that between July and December last year, the country’s crypto sector gained massive traction from traders looking to explore the market. The surveyed exchanges saw increased in trading volumes, daily activities and other areas of their business operations.
“Trading volume, market capitalization, operating income of exchanges, deposits in Korean won all increased compared to the first half due to the rise in crypto prices and recovery of investor sentiment. The number of crypto trading users rebounded from the first half of 2023,” said KoFIU.
Daily Trading Volume
The daily trading volume of domestic virtual assets during the latter part of 2023 reached 3.6 trillion won ( $2.6 billion). The figure represents a 24% surge compared to the first half.
In the KRW market, the average daily trading volume saw a 24% increase to $2.6 billion. Despite this increase, the coin market experienced a decline of 44% to $30,000.
The coin market refers to crypto-to-crypto transactions where traders exchange their digital asset holdings for other types of cryptocurrencies without involving national currencies like dollars or Korean won.
Individual Investors Lead Surge in Registered Users
In addition to the increased daily trading activities in South Korea, local crypto exchanges also experienced growth in user base well ahead of the global crypto surge that pushed prices to unprecedented levels in early 2024. According to the survey, active users of registered exchanges in the country soared by 390,000 to reach 6.45 million by the close of 2023.
This surge in users, accounting for over 10% of the nation’s total population, was predominantly driven by individual investors trading Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (Ether), and other altcoins.
This group of investors made up 99% of the total number of active registered users, with nearly 60% of them falling within the age range of 30s and 40s.

Why Is the Crypto Market Up Today?


The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) shot up above $2.3 trillion as the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading came in cooler than expectations. The headline CPI April came in at 3.4% year on year against the expectations of 3.6% from March’s 3.8%.
Along with this Bitcoin price too surged and so did the altcoins with Fantom leading the pack with a 24% rise.
In the news today:-

Ripple joins hands with Cosmos’ Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based protocol Evmos to build an XRP Ledger sidechain. This chain will be designed to be EVM-compatible.
IOTA launched its “Testnet 2.0” which will enable the migration of the chain from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). The aim is to improve the scalability and efficiency of the network.


TOTAL Breaks Out
The total market cap broke out of the symmetrical triangle it was in for the past month on the back of softening inflation. This brought the total value of all crypto assets to $2.32 trillion, adding nearly $140 billion in the span of a single day.
If the support at $2.3 is secured, the crypto market cap could continue rising gradually.

However, losing the same support could result in a fall back towards $2.25 trillion or lower.

Bitcoin Price Breaches $65,000
Bitcoin’s price too rallied along with the rest of the altcoins as the biggest crypto asset in the world crossed the $65,000 mark. BTC can be seen trading at $65,800 at the time of writing, after closing above $66,000 yesterday.
The flag pattern suggests a 45% uptick is on the cards but the practical outlook would be a breach of $68,500 in the coming days.

On the other hand, this rise might also trigger corrections at the hands of investors should they move to book profits.

Fantom Surprises the Market
Among all the top altcoins, Fantom’s price rise placed it at the top of the best-performing asset list. The altcoin increased by more than 24% to breach the $8 barrier at the moment. FTM has entered the resistance box between $0.80 and $0.88.
This range has been tested as support and resistance, making it a crucial area to breach above. Flipping it into support could trigger a major rally for the cryptocurrency.

However, the altcoin has failed a breach in the past. If the same occurs this time as well, Fantom’s price could drop back down to $7. Further drawdown will bring it to $6.3 support floor.

First Bitcoin Statement from Vanguard's New CEO! - Bitcoin Sistemi

US-based investment company Vanguard, which has a negative perspective on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, recently introduced its new CEO.
Vanguard, which manages $7.2 trillion in assets, has named Salim Ramji, the former head of BlackRock's global ETF division, as its new CEO.


It was wondered whether there would be a change in Vanguard's decision regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs regarding the transfer of Salim Ramji, an important name in the launch of BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF, to Vanguard.
Unlike global giants such as BlackRock, Vanguard's new CEO Salim Ramji, who has a negative attitude towards cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, gave his first interview and announced that the BTC ETF decision will not be reversed.





Speaking to Barron's, Ramji said that Vanguard has not changed its mind about Bitcoin and that the company will not reverse its decision not to launch spot Bitcoin.
In his statement, Ramji stated that his new company, Vanguard, represents consistency and that crypto-related investment products do not align with the “company's investment philosophy.”



“I think it's important for companies to be consistent in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer.
I heard the statement from the company's CIO, Greg Davis, and I think it is entirely consistent with Vanguard's investment philosophy. “It's a logical and consistent point of view.”

Vanguard views Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a speculative and immature asset class.

Crypto casinos can onboard millions of users into Web3 - MyPrize CEO

Over the long course of human history, one activity that has followed humanity practically everywhere is gambling. The earliest evidence of human gambling dates back to the Paleolithic era, and it has been present in every major civilization and society since then.As technology has evolved, so have the ways people gamble. While major gambling hubs such as Las Vegas and Macau still dominate with brick-and-mortar casinos and entertainment, online casinos have exploded in recent years — and many of these websites use cryptocurrency to power their platforms. The largest, Stake, reportedly generated a whopping $2.6 billion in gross revenue in 2022 alone.On episode 14 of The Agenda podcast, hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond spoke with Zach Bruch, founder and CEO of MyPrize — a crypto casino that recently emerged from stealth and is now open for early access — to better understand how crypto casinos work, where they fit into the broader crypto ecosystem, and how they might be silently onboarding millions of people into Web3.Crypto and gambling: a match made in heaven?Bruch argued that the biggest use case for crypto in 2024 is still speculation, and this is playing out via the memecoin craze, which The Agenda recently discussed in depth in episode 34 with Andreas Brekken of SideShift.ai. According to Bruch, memecoins are so popular “because people love to speculate. People are having fun with their friends. They’re participating as a group. They’re rallying around something, and they’re speculating together.”“Gambling has been around since the very first day of human life. People love taking risk. Crypto is the epitome of that.” Bruch sees crypto casinos as fun places where people can come together as friends to engage in risk-taking and speculative behavior in a fun environment where — at least for MyPrize — the minimum bets can be as low as $0.01.But operating an online crypto casino is not without its challenges. For one, it must comply with the regulatory requirements of each country it operates in, which is why many online casinos — MyPrize included — have separate websites with different functionalities for United States-based customers.The security concerns also differ, as crypto casinos have to make sure their code and smart contracts are bulletproof. In September 2023, Stake was hacked for a reported $41 million. According to Bruch, operating a crypto casino is more akin to operating a crypto exchange: “You’re building user accounts. You’re thinking about AML, KYC, fraud, chargeback risk, asset security, all those different types of things. And all of that comes into play for an online casino as well, right?”Gambling as a path toward mass adoptionBruch told The Agenda that online casinos offer significant on-ramps into the crypto ecosystem. “Most people don’t even recognize this, but some of the largest applications for crypto today are on-ramping into the casino space,” he said, offering the opportunity to then funnel these customers into the broader crypto ecosystem. Bruch said that this is made easier because gambling already has a long history of having a great product-market fit.“You have all these traditional folks that aren’t actually active members of the crypto ecosystem or the crypto ecosystem that we know it, but are active gamers and gamblers in online casinos, and they are buying crypto to go play in these sites.”This is the long-term vision of MyPrize: users will on-ramp into crypto through the casino and then remain in Web3. “We’re starting by creating a killer application that will onboard millions of users, and then we’ll funnel those millions of users into a much broader decentralized ecosystem,” Bruch said.To hear more from Bruch’s conversation with The Agenda — including the future of “GambleFi,” whether there will be casinos in the metaverse and more — listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Arbitrum Reaches All-Time High for Newly Created Addresses | Cryptopolitan

Arbitrum (ARB) addresses reached an all-time high in May after new users flowed into the platform to make use of its DeFi and NFT offers. The peak activity news also helped ARB recover faster during the latest rally. The Arbitrum network is now ranked among top Layer 2 solutions for Ethereum, and offers faster and clearer smart contracts for messages and activities between L1 and L2 addresses. The address peak in Arbitrum was also sudden, with unique active wallets now close to 900,000. The generation of new wallets started the growth trend in March, and went vertical in the past two weeks. One of the reasons for the growth of Arbitrum is the direct targeting of developers. New teams have started using Arbitrum as a basis for their decentralized apps. Source: NansenThe other reason for the growth of Aave is the optimization of gas fees, which have fallen since the end of March, while transaction counts expanded. Arbitrum already carries some leading multi-chain apps, including Uniswap, Sushi Swap, OKX DEX, Trader Joe, and Aave. Web3 gaming is also experiencing an active period, this time choosing Arbitrum’s tech for new competitive experiences. The Arbitrum DAO is currently voting to add more projects as Orbit Chains, with opportunities to connect to other L1 or L2 networks.Arbitrum Introduces Orbit Chains for Easier Infrastructure CreationArbitrum aims to grow more sustainably by drawing on crypto startups. One of the main tools are the Orbit Chains, which offers a fast creation of new layers. New projects can now spend a minimal time to build the desired features, setting up their mainnets without delay. In a market where new tokens arrive every minute, projects choose Arbitrum for the immediate creation of new features. Orbit Chains allow Arbitrum to become a hub for projects, making it similar to other platforms. Offering easier chain creation and connectivity was the main point behind Polkadot, Cosmos, and even Avalanche with its subnet creation. DeFi Grows with ARB Connections to Other ChainsArbitrum also offers a cross-chain bridge, which is highly liquid and has a daily turnover above $5M even on a slow day. The Arbitrum bridge is widely used for wrapped Ethereum and various stablecoins. The bridge is part of the DeFi ecosystem, where Arbitrum has grown its locked value to $2.76M. The performance of DeFi on Arbitrum is an exception, as its biggest growth phase happened in late 2023. Unlike other networks, Arbitrum did not peak in 2021-2022, and instead is waiting for more sustainable growth. Arbitrum recently started hosting liquid restaking, a tool to tap the value of locked ETH tokens. The Renzo multi-chain project increased its holdings on Arbitrum by 25% in a month, locking in more than $324M in notional value.Bitcoin DeFi Starts to Spread to ArbitrumArbitrum’s growth may also be tied to attempts to use Bitcoin and tap its value in new decentralized tools. Wrapped BTC coins are not new and have been used as collateral in various projects. But now, platforms are competing again to integrate Bitcoin into decentralized finance. Projects on Arbitrum create gamified solutions for Bitcoin DeFi, combined with NFT collections. There is still no clear-cut way to bring BTC products on Arbitrum, as most of the offers will come from independent builders. ARB Token Recovers Close to $1Despite the growth of use cases, the ARB token is near its lower trading range at $0.99. The asset peaked above $2.20 in early 2024, and has returned to its baseline price. ARB is now in a period of re-accumulation, though some traders expect a new downturn to the $0.80 range. However, during a period of increasing usage, ARB sets the expectations for a new rally. The token has traded for over a year, and has positioned itself successfully among leading L2 solutions. Cryptopolitan reporting by Hristina Vasileva

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Tops $66K as Interest-Rate Cuts Loom

Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) plans to offer spot bitcoin trading in response to demand from clients, according to the Financial Times. Already the top bitcoin futures exchange, CME is aiming to take on the likes of Binance and Coinbase, who dominate the spot market. “Crypto exchanges might lose some business with the potential debut of a bitcoin spot market on the CME, a global derivatives giant, as the present bull run is particularly driven by institutions, who prefer to trade on regulated avenues," Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said. The spot trading business could be run through the EBC currency trading venue in Switzerland, the report added.

Shiba Inu Team Member Declares Altcoin Season A Time For Shibarium To Shine | Bitcoinist.com


								As the cryptocurrency industry moves toward a thriving altcoin Season, popular Shiba Inu team member and marketing lead Lucie has proclaimed the season is the perfect time to showcase the potential of Shibarium, the project’s layer 2 blockchain solution, to the larger cryptocurrency community. In this statement, Lucie positions Shibarium as a major participant in the altcoin boom by highlighting its distinct benefits and technological advancements.
Altcoin Season: A Golden Opportunity For Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Capabilities
On Wednesday, Shiba Inu marketing head Lucie shared her insights on the much-anticipated altcoin season and its impact on the project’s ecosystem. According to Lucie, Altcoin season is a thrilling time when altcoins frequently perform better than Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency asset, which presents a fantastic opportunity for Shibarium and the ShibArmy.
The post read:
Altcoin season is an exciting period when alternative crypto often outperforms Bitcoin. For Shibarium and the ShibArmy, it is a fantastic opportunity.
During altcoin season, Lucie pointed out that funds tend to move from Bitcoin to altcoins such as SHIB, SHEB, BONE, LEASH, and other Shibarium tokens. This shift in investment will potentially trigger the value of these altcoins considerably. Thus Shibarium may become more widely used and benefit the ecology, due to its distinct qualities.

Another aspect highlighted by Lucie to be triggered by the altcoin season is Shiba Inu’s community power. In the course of the period, the fervor of the ShibArmy may fuel more visibility and appeal of Shibarium tokens.
The altcoin season will also cause an increase in trading volume and liquidity, according to the marketing head. “Higher trading volume means more liquidity, making it easier to trade Shibarium tokens,” she stated.
Lastly, Lucie advocates the growth of the layer 2 solution during the altcoin season, as the excitement may encourage Shibarium’s growth and innovation, which would benefit the entire crypto community.
As a result, the Shiba Inu team member believes that making money during the altcoin season is not all to consider but also an opportunity to establish Shibarium‘s reputation in the cryptocurrency space and highlight its potential.
How To Determine Altcoin Season
Lucie has also identified several factors to observe in order to determine when an altcoin season begins. The first aspect to watch out for is the investors’ interest in Bitcoin and the optimism around its price when the bull cycle starts.

When Bitcoin appreciates, it attracts all of the attention and capital for a period. After experiencing significant increases, investors sell some Bitcoin to lock in profits, thereby looking for the next big investment, turning their attention towards altcoins, triggering an altcoin season.
With more investors shifting their investments towards the altcoin market, prices will increase significantly, surpassing Bitcoin’s performance in the period. “So, a bull run starts with Bitcoin, then money flows into altcoins, creating altcoin season where altcoins surge in value,” she added.

How Humanity Protocol CEO drove his previous firm to insolvency


The CEO of Humanity Protocol, a reported $1 billion ‘Worldcoin rival’ that’s raised $30 million, almost bankrupted his $1.5 billion smartphone firm, burning through $170 million in investor funds.
Terence Kwok founded Hong Kong-based Tink Labs in 2012. The Unicorn company raised millions in funding to provide hotels with smartphones for guests to use during their stay. 
His goal was to give guests an alternative to roaming charges, improve their hotel experience, and sell gathered data on customer preferences.
However, the Financial Times (FT) reports that his firm began to operate at a loss of £9.06 million in 2017. This was reportedly due to multiple factors, including his policy of aggressive expansion, roaming charges becoming cheaper and more accessible, and hotels not wanting to pay for the phones he had given out.
Terence Kwok’s Tink Labs liquidated 
According to a former employee, Tink Labs investor SoftBank forced it to abruptly stop a major project over concerns the firm was “funnelling money from the joint venture in Japan to stay afloat in other regions.”
Kwok reportedly struggled to pay employees and contractors and eventually ordered mass layoffs before closing Tink Labs on August 1. Laid-off employees reportedly “smeared cake all over the walls and floor,” as they left the firm’s Oxford offices. 
Tink Labs’ European arm began winding up in January 2020 before undergoing insolvency proceedings. The former head of various Tink Labs human resource operations told FT, “I never thought it would last but I didn’t think it would close so quickly.” She also told the FT that Kwok only cared about “making money.”
Terence Kwok CEO of human palm ID crypto firm
Last year, Kwok launched Humanity Protocol, a blockchain-based identity firm that relies on scanning the palms of people’s hands as a means of identification.
The firm reportedly raised $30 million in funding from Kingsway Capital, Animoca Brands, Blockchain.com, and Shima Capital, and has already reached Unicorn status. 

Kwok told Bloomberg that Humanity Protocol will use its own crypto token to pay for verification fees. The funding round reportedly ensures investors’ future tokens through a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT). 
A test network will reportedly be launched in the second quarter and an infrared camera is being worked on that will allow your phone to scan your veins as an extra layer of security. He claims to have a waitlist of 500,000 people for the project.

Coindesk dubbed Humanity Protocol a ‘Worldcoin rival.’ Indeed, it’s similar to Worldcoin’s ‘proof of personhood’ system. Kwok calls his concept ‘Proof of Humanity,’ and told Bloomberg that unlike Worldcoin or Face ID, “It’s not your face and it’s also not your eyeballs. It’s much less dystopian.”

The top SHIB developer specified that the new version of ShibaSwap’s main focus will be on the discovery of new meme coins – “so all the creative geniuses meme away,” he said encouragingly.Dhairya also promised that the SHIB team will continue to push out updates and upgrades regularly going forward, since SHIB, Shibarium and everything about them is “not a race, it’s a marathon.” Now, the ShibaSwap DEX will be operating on both the Ethereum and Shibarium blockchains, with a firm bridge between them to allow moving assets from one to the other and back, thus expanding opportunities for the SHIB army and adding adoption and utility to Shibarium tokens.Shiba Inu price skyrockets on newsFueled by the news of ShibaSwap launching on Shibarium, the price of the native SHIB meme coin has soared. Over the past 24 hours, Shiba Inu has printed a massive 12% increase, soaring from $0.00002293 to the $0.00002577 level.A tiny pullback followed that astounding increase as SHIB stepped back by a marginal 2%.As the price soared overnight, an anonymous meme coin holder transferred a jaw-dropping amount of three trillion Shiba Inu from an unregistered wallet to the popular trading platform Robinhood in the last 24 hours. This amount of Shiba Inu is evaluated at more than $74 million in fiat.

                        Launched in January 2023, the Ordinals Protocol opened the Bitcoin ecosystem up to the craziness of NFTs, enabling users to inscribe data – images, art, videos, and more – to individual Bitcoin denominations known as satoshis.The idea of bringing NFTs to the Bitcoin network might have seemed frivolous to some.Others, though, recognized the significance and heralded Ordinals as a shot in the arm for the Proof-of-Work blockchain.Strong as it was, the digital gold narrative would now be supported by another compelling use-case as bitcoin became more than a deflationary digital currency: now it could double as a non-fungible piece of digital art or a piece of music.Ordinals: From Inscriptions to Infinity
The arrival of Ordinals effectively enabled the minting of NFTs directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain for the first time. The idea is credited to ex-Bitcoin Core contributor and Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor.Ordinals represents a system wherein serial numbers are assigned to satoshis, giving each a unique identifier which can be tracked across transactions and enabling users to attach supplementary data to them (inscriptions).Mere months after the arrival of Ordinals, an anonymous developer pioneered BRC-20, a token standard that extended Bitcoin functionality by supporting the minting and transfer of fungible tokens via a protocol.The experimental standard – which utilizes Ordinal inscriptions to embed token data directly on the blockchain – has been a revelation: less than a year after the launch of Ordinals, moonshot BRC-20 meme coin ORDI surpassed $1 billion in market cap.As for Ordinals, around 66.5 million inscriptions have been made on satoshis according to Dune Analytics.Given there are 100 million satoshis per bitcoin, we have some way to go before inscriptions equate to a whole coin. The dollar amount generated by Ordinals fees, meanwhile, exceeds $417 million.In less than 18 months since Ordinals officially launched, there have been many meaningful milestones, from the debut of the first Ordinals Collection (Bitcoin Shrooms) to the arrival of the first-ever inscription service (OrdinalsBot) and the aforementioned success of ORDI.Among the biggest milestones was the opening of a Bitcoin NFT marketplace on Magic Eden, which set the scene for frantic trading of Bitcoin-based BRC-20 NFTs, akin to the Ethereum NFT boom of 2021.How Do Bitcoin Ordinals Compare to Ethereum NFTs?
So, how do the bitcoin-based NFTs conceived compare to the more long-established equivalents on Ethereum?The major difference worth noting is that Ethereum NFTs are created using smart contracts based on standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155.This actually means that NFT data can be stored on different layers of the Ethereum blockchain or even on the InterPlanetary File System, with NFTs benefitting from greater functionality. By contrast, bitcoin NFTs are recorded directly on the eponymous blockchain.Another point of divergence relates to transaction fees. Because Ordinals are stored on-chain, transaction fees are higher. Ethereum NFTs, by contrast, can be stored off-chain and thus benefit from lower fees.Because NFT royalties work via smart contracts, and Bitcoin is not a smart contract network, Ordinals do not entitle creators to royalty revenue on re-sales of their work.That said, there are initiatives which seek to bring smart contract capability to Bitcoin, covenants being one example.Although maligned by some for bringing DeFi degeneracy to Bitcoin (not to mention driving up network fees), Ordinals and BRC-20 have been praised by the likes of Vitalik Buterin, who hailed the “organic return of builder culture” to the PoW network last summer.It is a culture that has collided with Ethereum’s in the form of the BRC-721 token standard which enables the bridging of ERC-721 NFTs from Ethereum to Bitcoin.Interestingly, Ordinals can be leveraged for purposes beyond inscribing a message onto a satoshi: a recent initiative by major BTC hodler MicroStrategy sees the protocol utilized to enable the creation of trustless, tamper-proof decentralized identifiers (DIDs).There is an argument to be made that Ordinals has learned lessons from the previous NFT boom and, since inscriptions cannot be modified post-creation and bitcoin NFTs are inherently scarcer, they are better at preserving their value. Time will tell.The Blooming of Bitcoin Layer-2sThe success of Ordinals is inextricably linked with the rise of Bitcoin Layer-2s, secondary protocols built on top of Bitcoin and intended to address the network’s scalability challenges while enhancing its utility.In a sense, this evolution of the Bitcoin network is following a similar trend to Ethereum, which spawned its own multitude of Layer-2s during the last major DeFi boom.One such Layer-2 is Merlin Chain, which leverages ZK-Rollup technology to compress transaction data and therefore enable faster and cheaper transactions.Other distinguishing features of the L2 include its decentralized oracle network, on-chain BTC fraud-proof modules, and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.Despite only launching earlier this year, Merlin has become by far the biggest Bitcoin sidechain, its $1 billion + TVL vastly exceeding that of Rootstock, Stacks and other Bitcoin L2s.The team behind Merlin Chain previously developed BRC-420, a standard that transforms Ordinals inscriptions into assets that can interact with each other – known as recursive inscriptions.Notably, BRC-420 introduces a royalty standard, entitling developers to revenues from usage of their creations, with the team committed to unleashing the potential of Bitcoin’s native assets, protocols like Ordinals, and attendant products.With the market cap of Bitcoin L2 solutions now exceeding $4.3 billion less than 18 months after the launch of Ordinals, Casey Rodarmor has a lot to be proud of.Not that the developer has rested on his laurels: in April he launched Runes, a protocol for fungible tokens that leverages Bitcoin.

Youthful Demography Fuels South Korea's Crypto Boom


							

Retail investors drive South Korea’s rise in global crypto market



A young demography reshaping South Korea’s crypto landscape



Upcoming regulations signal proactive approach to crypto oversight




In a recent Bloomberg Crypto report, South Korean retail investors are credited with fueling the surge in local digital asset exchanges, predating the global crypto boom that pushed prices to record highs earlier in 2024. 



The Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KOFIU) revealed a significant uptick in crypto participation, with active users on registered exchanges surging by 390,000 to 6.45 million by year-end 2023.







This surge in activity is particularly noteworthy, representing over 10% of the country’s total population, according to reports. The majority of these investors, categorized as “individual” investors, fall within the 30-40 age range, comprising nearly 60%.



Daily average crypto trading volume in South Korea also witnessed a substantial increase of 24%, reaching 3.6 trillion won ($2.6 billion) during the same period. This trading activity surge paralleled a remarkable 53% increase in the total value of crypto held by registered exchanges, reaching 43.6 trillion won.



These figures underscore South Korea’s growing importance in the global crypto landscape. The South Korean Won (KRW) emerged as the most-used currency for crypto trading in the first quarter of 2024, surpassing even the US dollar. Upbit, the biggest exchange in the country, is often in the top five global trading exchanges.









KOFIU attributed the surge in various metrics, including trading volume, market capitalization, exchange operating income, and Korean won deposits, to the rise in crypto prices and a rebound in investor sentiment.



Despite the recent collapse of TerraUSD, a stablecoin developed by South Korean native Do Kwon, the country’s crypto enthusiasm remains resilient. This resilience is further evidenced by a major political party’s campaign pledge to grant Koreans access to US Bitcoin ETFs during the recent parliamentary election.



Looking ahead, South Korea is poised to implement the Virtual Asset User Protection Act in July, introducing stricter regulations for exchanges and harsher penalties for wrongdoing in the sector.

Ethereum Flashing Bearish Signal, According to Crypto Analyst Benjamin Cowen - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								Widely followed cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that the price of Ethereum (ETH) could depreciate drastically.
Cowen tells his 801,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum has fallen below the Bull Market Support Band (BMSB), an indicator consisting of a 20-week simple moving average and a 20-week exponential moving average used to determine whether the price of an asset is in bullish or bearish territory.










“The last time that Ethereum fell below its Bull Market Support Band was actually about 30 weeks ago. Or the last time it was below its 20-week simple moving average was about 30 weeks ago. So it’s been quite a while and now we have closed below it once again.”
According to Cowen, the price of Ethereum fell drastically during two previous times that closely resemble the current moment when the second-largest crypto asset closed below the BMSB.
“In both cases, after it fell below the Bull Mark Support Band, Ethereum/US dollar then fell about another 50%…
…50% from here [around $2,970] puts ETH all the way back down at around $1,400.”
Ethereum is trading at $2,902 at time of writing.
The widely followed analyst says that he foresees the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair bottoming out over the coming weeks though the Ethereum/US dollar (ETH/USD) pair could take longer to form a bottom.

ETP: 21Shares analyzes the impact of the Pectra update on Ethereum

Recently 21Shares, a leading company in the issuance of ETPs linked to crypto, analyzed the impact of the technical improvements that will be made by the upcoming Pectra update to the Ethereum blockchain, scheduled for Q4 2024/Q1 2025.
On paper, Pectra should bring greater efficiency to the capital locked in staking and greater flexibility in terms of transaction management.
In particular, the EIP-7702, recently proposed by Vitalik Buterin, if included in Pectra (replacing EIP 3074) could provide new smart contract functionalities to users’ EOA wallets adding very interesting features.Let’s see what it’s all about.

21Shares: the largest ETP manager studies the improvements that will be made to the Ethereum blockchain thanks to Pectra
According to Adrian Fritz, Head of Research at the largest crypto ETP issuer 21Shares, the impact of the upcoming Pectra update on the Ethereum blockchain could be crucial for the future cryptographic ecosystem.
Pectra, arrives after the recent implementation of Dencun, and will be a combination of the two upgrades Electra and Prague, respectively aimed at changing the consensus level and the execution level of the network.
According to the schedule set by the Ethereum Foundation and its team of developers, the update and the next hard fork of the network will arrive between the end of 2024 and the beginning of 2025.
The Nethermind client has already revealed to the public that the implementation on the testnet was successful and now the next appointment is with pectra-devnet-0.

Pectra represents a response to the evolution of the environment surrounding the Ethereum blockchain, with numerous improvements that will be made thanks to the 6 EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) that will be included within it:
EIP-6110: Provide validator deposits on the chain
EIP-7002: execution-level activatable outputs
EIP-7549: Moving the committee index outside the attestation
EIP-2537: precompilation for operations on the BLS12-381 curve
EIP-3074: AUTH and AUTHCALL opcodes
EIP-7251: Increase MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE
As the famous ETP issuer 21Shares analyzes, the Pectra update as a whole will help strengthen network stability and enhance user experience.
In particular, one of the main focuses of the update is aimed at increasing the stake quota to participate in consensus from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, avoiding the fragmentation of capital by large validators who currently have to use a multitude of different wallets to manage the stake on the Beacon chain.
It is worth mentioning the EIP 3074, which aims to bring significant improvements to the management of resources in a wallet, including smart contract functionalities to EOA accounts.
Simplifying, we can summarize the effects in the introduction of the so-called “sponsored transactions” that will allow the use of the Ethereum network even in the absence of ETH to pay the gas.
The same EIP also wants to introduce the possibility of performing multiple actions in a single transaction and at the same time adding a social recovery solution for all inactive wallets after one year.

21Shares reminds us that Pectra will also solve the problem of so-called “empty accounts“, that is, those users with assets or funds invested equal to zero, by excluding them from the network.
This is how you should free up network space, which will lead to a general lightening of the system and, consequently, to a simpler and faster processing of transactions.
Vitalik’s EIP-7702 could replace EIP-3047: debates among Ethereum community experts begin
Until a few days ago it was clear that EIP-3047 would be included in the Pectra hard fork, now it is no longer so obvious after Vitalik Buterin proposed the new EIP-7702 which could replace the first one by addressing some critical issues.
As stated by the ETP crypto issuer 21Shares, this proposal, similar to EIP 3047, aims to transform users’ EOA portfolios into more sophisticated accounts, but with a more streamlined modus operandi.

While the EIP-3074 proposed by developers Ayush Bherwani and 0xDanki aims to implement the ability for EOA wallets to authorize smart contracts and perform transactions on their behalf, Vitalik’s EIP 7702 allows the same wallets to temporarily become accounts authorized to sign smart contracts during a transaction, reverting back afterwards.
This is a subtle difference but with very visible effects because in the first approach it is necessary to introduce new operating codes (auth and authcall) in addition to the implementation of invoker contracts that would complicate the work of the Ethereum network.
Vitalik’s EIP-7702 compared to the first one turns out to be more flexible (although technically more complex to implement) but at the same time guarantees full compatibility with account abstraction and with the ERC-4337 standard.
It is worth noting how EIP-3047 entails risks associated with the authorization of smart contracts, adding the possibility of emptying a complete address with a single signature (as it happens on Solana), while currently “n” signatures are required, where “n” is the number of assets owned by an EOA.
At the moment this EIP, as described in the previous paragraph, has already been included in Pectra’s implementation program, but after Vitalik’s intervention it may be replaced.
The debates of the community and industry experts continue unabated to understand which will be the best solution to adopt.

According to Adrian Fritz’s comment, 21Shares is in favor of Vitalik’s proposal as it expands the functionalities and potential of cryptographic wallets, while maintaining the security component intact. Here are his words:
“At 21Shares, we look favorably upon EIP 7702, which also reflects our thesis that cryptocurrencies will never be able to onboard millions more people without providing them with an intuitive interface that resembles the user-friendly experience they are familiar with on Web2 applications.”
The wish for Ethereum blockchain is that these improvement proposals will be successfully implemented following the established timeline and that they can bring improvements on the same level as what was done with Dencun, which significantly reduced the cost of fees on the network’s layer-2.

ShibaSwap Moves to Shibarium: Lower Fees, Faster Transactions, and Enhanced Utility | Cryptoglobe


                                
Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a decentralized cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator or group of creators known as Ryoshi. It is an Ethereum-based altcoin that features the Shiba Inu dog breed as its mascot. SHIB is often labeled as a “meme coin” or parody cryptocurrency, akin to Dogecoin, which it aims to rival or even surpass as a “Dogecoin killer.”



The Shiba Inu ecosystem is built around the concept of being a community-driven project, with its principles detailed in a “woof paper.” This project began from the ground up, without any pre-existing community or team, emphasizing the power of collective decentralization to create something unique and impactful. The ecosystem comprises tokens such as $SHIB, $LEASH, and $BONE, along with native SHIBOSHIs and SHEboshi NFTs.



ShibaSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that serves as the cornerstone of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It enables users to trade, farm, and stake SHIB and other tokens within the ecosystem, such as BONE and LEASH. ShibaSwap operates on the Ethereum network and uses its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, providing a platform for secure and efficient transactions.



In January 2023, Shibarium was introduced as a layer-two blockchain designed to run on top of the Ethereum network. Shibarium aims to alleviate congestion, introduce staking capabilities, lower gas fees, and offer a framework for decentralized applications (DApps) and Web3 expansion within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It went live in August 2023.



On 16 May 2024, the Shiba Inu ecosystem announced a significant update to its decentralized finance (DeFi) offerings. The decentralized exchange (DEX) ShibaSwap has now been ported to the Shibarium blockchain. This move marks a crucial upgrade, allowing ShibaSwap to operate on both the Ethereum and Shibarium networks. This dual functionality aims to empower creators, foster connections, and drive innovation within the Shiba Inu ecosystem.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The transition to Shibarium introduces a variety of new utilities for ShibaSwap, enhancing its capabilities as a DEX and decentralized application (DApp) platform. Key improvements include a new and enhanced dashboard, streamlined user processes for adding and withdrawing liquidity, staking, and trend analysis. Additionally, the platform now features discovery charts for new and trending tokens, helping traders navigate market volatility. The onboarding process for new tokens onto ShibaSwap has also been simplified.



The Shiba Inu community is encouraged to utilize ShibaSwap on the Shibarium blockchain. A portion of transaction fees will be used to enhance the value of the liquidity provider (LP) tokens used in swap transactions. This increase in LP token value is expected to benefit yield farmers within the community.



Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, commented on the update, stating that the new ShibaSwap offers a transformative experience for DeFi innovators on Shibarium. The redesigned platform aims to support community tokens and invites current Shibarium tokens to port over easily. Kusama emphasized that this is an early version of ShibaSwap, with more updates planned for the future.



Shibarium is designed to facilitate high-speed transactions with minimal gas fees, transforming the user experience in the blockchain space. Built on a community-first and environmentally friendly consensus mechanism, Shibarium enables the development of cost-effective protocols. This expansion enriches the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which includes the $SHIB and $LEASH tokens, SHEboshis DN-404 tokens, SHIB The Metaverse, the ShibaSwap DEX, and the Shiba Eternity game.

Bitcoin price: Here’s why QCP Capital expects BTC run to $74k - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Bitcoin surges past $66k after US CPI data triggers buyside pressure
Here’s why QCP Capital analysts say BTC could run to $74k

Bitcoin price surged past the $66,000 mark on Thursday to hit highs last seen in April amid a fresh dose of bullish sentiment.
BTC price reached $66,699 on US-based crypto exchange Coinbase, extending gains seen when markets soared on softer-than-expected US inflation data released on Wednesday.
Bitcoin price outlook: QCP Capital says bulls can reclaim the ATH
According to analysts at QCP Capital, the bullish momentum currently surrounding Bitcoin could see prices run to highs of $74,000.
The market reaction to the US Consumer Prices Index (CPI) data release, as well as the broader traction for spot Bitcoin ETFs, are potential catalysts.
“US CPI numbers triggered a break out of the range across risk assets. BTC has since traded back above 66k. ⁠We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of 74k. The desk saw sizable buyers of 100-120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot,” the Singapore-based platform said in a note on Thursday.
The analysts also pointed to the increased institutional demand for the flagship cryptocurrency. The last few days have seen large asset managers file their 13Fs, disclosing huge positions in spot Bitcoin ETFs.
For instance, Susquehanna, Morgan Stanley and the State of Wisconsin Investment Board have disclosed huge holdings of BTC ETFs. Asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld have invested roughly 3% and 2% of their assets under management (AUM) respectively into spot Bitcoin ETFs.
“The stars seem to be aligning on this breakout with significant sovereign and institutional adoption, abating inflation and upcoming US elections. Is this the resumption of the bull market?” the QCP traders pondered.
At the time of writing, the benchmark cryptocurrency was up more than 5% in 24 hours, with trading volume at over $37.8 billion and showcasing a 24-hour increase of 93%.
BTC price reached its all-time high of $73,737 on March 14.

Cryptocurrency Bill is Being Submitted to Parliament! Here is the Time! - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to NTV's news, the bill on the definition of cryptocurrencies will be presented to the Turkish Grand National Assembly today.
In the news, it was stated that AK Party Group Chairman Abdullah Güler will announce the details regarding the “Proposal Law on Amendments to the Capital Markets Law” at the press conference he will hold in the Turkish Grand National Assembly at 15.30 today.


The news also stated that the proposal will define crypto assets for the first time and transactions will be legally regulated.

In his previous statements, Minister of Treasury and Finance Mehmet Şimşek said that the legal definition of cryptocurrency assets will be made for the first time in the said bill.





The enactment of this proposal is of particular importance for Turkey to be removed from the FATF gray list.
FATF, which determines the compliance of world economies in the fight against financial crimes, included Turkey on the so-called gray list in 2021 because it fell behind in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. While Türkiye is found to be compatible with 39 of 40 standards, it aims to eliminate the last deficiency in this field with its crypto regulation.


Minister Şimşek said in a statement: “Fighting against financial crimes is among our main priorities. According to the report shared by FATF, our country is in compliance with 39 of 40 FATF standards. Within the scope of technical compliance, the only issue that continues to be prepared is the work on cryptocurrencies. Our necessary work on this issue has reached the final stage.” “As such, Turkey has become one of the most successful countries in technical harmonization. We are determined to continue our work in this context by increasing the efficiency we will provide in practice. We are making efforts to remove our country from the gray list.” said.

Bitcoin Nears All-Time High on Renewed Institutional Demand


							

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows surge to 2-week high of $303 million.



Bitcoin price jumps 7% to $66,567, near all-time high.



Hedge funds join the rally, with Millennium holding $2 billion in Bitcoin ETFs.




Bitcoin prices rallied into bullish territory fueled by a surge in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and a 7% price increase over the past day. This positive movement comes on the heels of key US inflation data meeting expectations, easing investor concerns.







On May 15th, spot Bitcoin ETF inflows in the US skyrocketed to a two-week high of $303 million. This significant inflow reflects renewed institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency, mirroring the positive sentiment in the market.



Fidelity’s FBTC fund led the charge, attracting a record-breaking $131 million on the day, its highest since March 26th. Bitwise’s BITB fund wasn’t far behind, experiencing a solid day with an inflow of $86 million, its highest since early March. Even Grayscale’s GBTC, which had seen outflows for the past four months, witnessed a reversal with a $27 million inflow.



This renewed institutional interest extends beyond traditional investment firms. Regulatory filings revealed that hedge fund giant Millennium Management holds a staggering $2 billion Bitcoin ETF portfolio. Millennium Management is now the largest holder of specific Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. Other notable hedge funds like Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital and Apollo Management Holdings also disclosed holdings in Bitcoin ETFs, further solidifying the institutional appetite for the digital asset.









The surge in ETF inflows coincided with a significant jump in Bitcoin’s price. On May 15th, Bitcoin surged 7%, reaching a high of $66,567 during early Asian trading. This brings Bitcoin within 10% of its all-time high, a milestone last achieved in December 2021.



The positive market sentiment can be partly attributed to the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on May 15th. The data met expectations, easing concerns about inflation, a key factor influencing Federal Reserve’ decisions on interest rates. Lower interest rates tend to be positive for riskier assets like Bitcoin, as they increase investor appetite for higher-yielding alternatives.

                        Roaring Kitty is back, igniting excitement across the meme coin markets. Wall Street Pepe was leading the pack but in a dramatic collapse, the price has now crashed.This article will provide an analysis of WSP’s current price trends and look to see whether an innovative new meme coin, Dogeverse, represents a more compelling investment opportunity at this time.Wall Street Pepe’s dramatic rise has been fuelled by the spill-over from Roaring Kitty’s return, and has been egged on by a community sharing ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ inspired Pepe memes.WSP Price Analysis: As Wall Street Pepe Falls in Spectacular Rug-Pull – Is This The New Norm for GME Linked Tokens?
As price action slams down into true capitulation, Wall Street Pepe is currently trading at a market price of $0.0001315 (representing a 24-hour change of -98.85%).This comes after WSP price shocked retail markets Yesterday, mounting an incredible +14,400% rally to hit an all-time high at $0.01875.However, despite efforts by holders to consolidate these major gains above higher support at $0.01255, all was too good to be true – with a major dump engulfing the chart around 21:45PM UTC.In classic rug-pull form, as the dust settles, WSP price has been left in the dirt following a -98.5% bleed-out.Now, with a market cap of just $13,000 – it seems likely that WSP is finished, and set to join the ranks of countless GME-linked meme coins that have pumped and dumped since the return of Roaring Kitty.But WSP is not a unique instance; traders across the market have suffered the scourge of naughty blockchain developers deploying quickfire scams on DEX markets.From GME to KITTY to GameStop token; all have rugged – this is normal and to be expected with too good to be true meme coins.However, it doesn’t have to be that way, some meme coin projects have committed development teams on a mission to create lasting projects with strong staying power (think Dogcoins like DOGE or SHIB).Discover DOGEVERSE: Could Presales Offer Better Meme Coin Play?
While SOL presents a market-leading opportunity, the most significant gains are often found in presale investments, which allow investors to get in early and potentially secure the majority of a project’s growth.Just imagine investing in WSP before it hit the market and skyrocketed 14,000%.VIDEOOne such opportunity in the SOL ecosystem is the DOGEVERSE presale – which has unlocked viral success over the last month to hit $15M raised in the ongoing presale.Aiming to be the first multi-chain incarnation of DOGE, DOGEVERSE is positioned to grow rapidly as market participants race to grab a piece of the pie.DOGEVERSE is still raising funds at the presale stage and will start preparing for exchange listings very soon.Buy DOGEVERSE Here
