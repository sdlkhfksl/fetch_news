                        Over the last seven days, popular ERC-20 meme coin Floki ($FLOKI) outpaced crypto’s favorite doggy meme coins and rallied a blistering 23.7% to trade at $0.0002138.Floki’s rally comes as a sea of green candles across most leading cryptocurrencies makes for an emerald market.Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) is the usual pacesetter, and in the last seven days, it appreciated by 8.4% to trade at $66,293 as of this writing.The token underpinning DeFi’s busiest blockchain, Ethereum ($ETH), barely grew in price at all. It’s still trading at around $3,000 as it did this time last Thursday.That means Floki outpaced both the market leaders and the three biggest canine meme coins this week. In comparison, Dogecoin ($DOGE) only grew 6.5%, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) added 11.7%, DogWifHat ($WIF) grew 4.5% and Bonk ($BONK) climbed 9%.Floki is also one of the few leading cryptocurrencies that depreciated in the last 24 hours. It’s now down 2.9% from yesterday. The only other popular meme coin that fell overnight is Pepe Coin ($PEPE). The viral frog meme coin shed 5.7% overnight but led meme coin gains over the last seven days with a meaty rally of 29%.Over on FLOKI’s trading chart we can see the token has come down from a mid-March peak to lows of almost $0.0001, although its support level has since been climbing higher.Since coming down from $0.00022 in mid-April, the token has found stiff resistance at $0.0002, but today’s price represents a potential breakout.Source: TradingViewRelative strength index (RSI) signals are promising.

Floki is a meme coin named after Elon Musk’s dog. It’s also one of not two, not three, but five meme coins based on viral shiba inus, all of which are top ten meme coins.Before FLOKI, there was Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, after it there was Bonk and DogWifHat, with little to differentiate each from the other except novelty, tech specs, and/or blockchains.However, for those who believe in crypto’s longevity, a new generation of meme coins is cropping up which brings bundles of utility along with the laughs.Leading this new generation of coins is WienerAI.$WAI is a brand new meme token and AI companion that may yield potentially eye-watering rallies once word gets out about its core offering.The presale is only a month old, and it has already attracted close $1.9 million in investments.Touted as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner”, WienerAI ($WAI) is a digital companion that gives its owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees.The WienerAI smart contract was audited by Coinsult, a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms.Around 20% of $WAI’s supply is for staking.WienerAI’s website offers buyers the ability to stake during the presale, in order to take advantage of the lucrative yield, which is currently 508% APY.Stay on top of WienerAI news over on X and Telegram.Join the presale now over on the WienerAI website.

Before You Trust Another Crypto Guru, Read This Study's Results - Benzinga

A fresh study has provided a detailed analysis of the influence of crypto influencers on Twitter, with findings that carry significant implications for investors.The study by scholars from Indiana University, Harvard Business School, and Texas A&M University meticulously examined approximately 36,000 tweets from 180 prominent crypto-influencers over two years, shedding light on how these social media figures impact cryptocurrency prices.The study reveals that tweets from crypto-influencers are initially associated with positive returns. “The mean one-day return for crypto-influencer tweets is 1.83%,” the paper states, adding that “the return rate for small-cap tokens after one day is a notable 3.86%.” This initial surge in price highlights the significant short-term impact these influencers can have on the market.However, the research also points to a sobering reality for investors looking for long-term gains. “These tweets are followed by significant negative longer-horizon returns,” the authors report. Specifically, the study found that the average cumulative returns after 10 days were -2.24%, and this trend worsened over time, reaching -6.53% after 30 days.Also Read: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Pocket $303M Net Inflows On Wednesday: ‘Stars Seem To Be Aligning On This Breakout,’ Analytics Firm WritesWhy It Matters: The paper emphasizes, “Our results indicate that crypto-influencers’ tweets generate minimal long-term investment value.”The scholars highlight that these effects are particularly pronounced for influencers who proclaim themselves as “crypto experts” and have a substantial follower base.The study underscores the potential for conflicts of interest, with influencers possibly promoting cryptocurrencies for personal gain. “Our evidence supports ongoing regulatory concerns regarding investors being misled by social media influencers,” the authors caution.In their analysis, the researchers utilized machine-learning methods to classify tweets and found that the pattern of results was stronger when the tweets had a more positive sentiment or were retweeted extensively. This reinforces the idea that the influence of social media on cryptocurrency markets is both powerful and complex. However, the study did not look at individual cryptocurrencies. Particularly meme coins, such as Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD and their copycats are What’s Next: The findings of this study are especially relevant as the industry looks forward to Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on November 19.This event will provide a platform to discuss the evolving landscape of digital assets, the role of social media influencers, and the regulatory challenges that come with it.

ShibaSwap 2.0 on Shibarium Boosts SHIB and Burn Rate


Shiba Inu’s native decentralized exchange (DEX) platform, ShibaSwap, has officially launched on Shibarium. 
The DEX will be available on both Ethereum and Shibarium, the project’s Layer-2 scaling solution focused on fast and cheap transactions.
ShibaSwap on Shibarium: Uncovering New Functionalities

ShibaSwap’s migration to Shibarium brings several new features. Users now can create new liquidity pools, swap tokens on the network, and earn fees for providing liquidity. Other notable changes include discovery charts for new and trending tokens, and onboarding of new assets into the ShibaSwap.
The SHIB team asserts that the new strategy will enhance the value of LP tokens, benefiting the entire yield farming community. Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, encouraged users to try out the new swap and seamlessly port existing Shibarium tokens over to it. 
Kusama described ShibaSwap 2.0 as “redesigned beating heart of a freshly forked Shibarium,” highlighting its role in enabling community tokens to flourish.

“Rest assured, this new user experience is still an early version of Shibaswap, with more updates on the way,” he added.

With ShibaSwap on Shibarium, transactions will increase on the Layer-2 network. This heightened activity will accelerate the token burn rate, reducing the circulating supply of SHIB and potentially increasing its price. The protocol has explored various methods to boost the burn rate, and ShibaSwap’s integration might significantly impact this aspect.

The Shiba Inu community remains optimistic about these developments. SHIB price increased by 2.8% in the last 24 hours, while BONE — the governance token of the ShibaSwap — gained 4.7%.

How and when to sell your crypto - a simple guide

Missing out on a crypto bull market is tough, but what’s worse is watching your crypto wealth skyrocket only to crash before you can take profits.In the latest Cointelegraph video, we explain how to build your crypto exit strategy in a few simple steps.Taking profit means turning your digital gains into real money. There are two main ways to cash out in crypto: convert your assets into stablecoins and transfer them to your crypto wallet, or sell your crypto for fiat and transfer the money to your bank account.Deciding when to sell, which crypto to sell, and how much to sell depends on your financial situation, life stage, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Avoid trying to time the market perfectly. Instead, set clear price targets for selling your crypto and determine the percentage to sell at each target. For example, if you invested $25,000 in a particular coin, you might sell 20% when your portfolio reaches $50,000, 30% when it reaches $75,000, and so on.A popular strategy is the “house money” approach: when your investment significantly increases, cash out your initial investment and let the profits ride. This minimizes emotional stress, as you've already secured your initial funds.Remember, transaction fees and taxes can impact your net gains, so account for these costs. Ultimately, while holding crypto is beneficial, the goal is to use the profits to improve your life. Developing a disciplined exit strategy is key to achieving this balance.To find out more about how to best take profit out of crypto, check out the full video on our YouTube channel and don’t forget to subscribe! VIDEO

M2 money supply ‘holds the key’ for Bitcoin’s next move - Market analyst

The growing money supply in the United States could be the key to unlocking more upward momentum for Bitcoin (BTC), according to market analysts and historical chart patterns.M2 money supply growth could catalyze the next bull runThe M2 money supply estimates all cash and short-term bank deposits across the United States, and its growth has historically been correlated with previous Bitcoin bull runs.The growth of the money supply could hold the key for the next leg up for the Bitcoin cycle, according to Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Realvision, who wrote in a May 16 X post:“This is due to a high correlation with $BTC bull cycles. Of the big 3 I track in my Bitcoin/Liquidity framework, Global M2 appears to capture the most of the moves.”However, the changes in the money supply seem more important for Bitcoin price than the nominal value, according to Coutts:“The rate of change in money supply is more important than the nominal value.

Why CZ, Former Binance CEO Sentenced to Four Months in Prison, Still Hasn't Been Jailed? Here's Why and What Will Happen - Bitcoin Sistemi


Although Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, was sentenced to four months in prison, he is not yet in prison due to formalities in the criminal justice system, a world-class team of lawyers, and the right to a fair trial protections in the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution.
According to the judge's signed decision, Zhao “was to surrender to serve his sentence as notified by the Probation and Pretrial Services Office.” However, these offices have not yet notified Zhao that he must report to prison in California.


According to Federal Law 18, a criminal's sentence begins when that person is 'detained or voluntarily surrendered while awaiting transfer to an official detention facility where the sentence will be carried out.' Although this sentence can begin immediately on the day of sentencing, there are three possibilities for delay.
A judge may first force the defendant to surrender to the U.S. Marshals Department, which may then escort the defendant or physically notify him when to report to prison.






The judge may authorize the Office of Probation and Pretrial Services to notify the defendant of the prison entry date.
The judge may allow the defendant to go to prison voluntarily. Judges generally reserve this option for defendants who receive the shortest sentences or are least likely to escape.


Zhao made the second type of decision. Authorities did not immediately detain Zhao because he was not sentenced to a multi-year prison sentence. Instead, the judge gave Zhao the second-most lenient method. He is awaiting notification by the Office of Parole or Pretrial Services.

Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Competitor To Rip Higher, Predicts Outlook on Dogecoin and One More ETH Rival - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst predicts one Ethereum (ETH) competitor is about to have a massive breakout against Bitcoin (BTC).
Pseudonymous trader Kaleo tells his 638,000 followers on the social media platform X that the smart contract platform Avalanche (AVAX) could soar against BTC by more than 84% from its current value.










“AVAX/BTC: I might be crazy bros, but I still believe AVAX rips higher from here.”
Source: Kaleo/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests that AVAX/BTC is printing a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart and could soon reach 0.000950 BTC ($62.13).
AVAX/BTC is trading for .000515 BTC ($33.89) at time of writing, down more than 3% in the last 24 hours.
Next, the analyst predicts ETH competitor Solana is about to soar against Bitcoin (SOL/BTC) after printing a bullish pattern on the daily chart of higher high prices and higher low prices.
He believes SOL/BTC could soon cross the 0.0032 BTC ($209) level.
 “SOL/BTC: Solana is still one of the biggest no brainer long plays out there. Don’t fight strength.”
Source: Kaleo/X
SOL/BTC is trading for 0.00243 BTC ($160) at time of writing, up more than 3% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, the analyst predicts that Dogecoin (DOGE) will breakout based on a 2021 pattern when the memecoin rallied after the soaring meme stock GameStop (GME) hit a market top. GME had a massive rally this week but has since retraced.
“I’m going to make this simple for you. Here’s a chart of Dogecoin versus GME. You may not remember this, but it was GameStop that led the way back in early 2021. It wasn’t until after it topped that DOGE started sending. Dogecoin is overdue for a good pump. It’s almost time.”

DOGE is trading for $0.15 at time of writing, up slightly in the last 24 hours.

US Senate votes to overturn SEC rule, allowing regulated firms to hold Bitcoin - CoinJournal



                    

                    
60-38 in the Senate voted in favour of overturning the SEC rule.
Bipartisan support signals a potential shift in crypto regulation.
Presidential veto possible.

In a landmark decision, the US Senate has voted to overturn a key Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule that barred regulated financial firms from holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
The legislation, known as H.J. Res. 109, previously passed in the US House with bipartisan support and the Senate’s support signals a potential shift in the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States.
Bipartisan support for H.J. Res. 109 reversal
The decision to overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121 garnered significant bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate.
The rule, which had been in effect for two years, prohibited regulated financial institutions from holding cryptocurrencies.
However, lawmakers have moved to invalidate this restrictive regulation with a vote of 60-38 in the Senate and a 228–182 vote in the House.
Supporters of the legislation argue that allowing regulated firms to hold cryptocurrencies will provide consumers with more options and opportunities in the rapidly evolving digital asset market. They contend that regulated institutions are well-equipped to handle the risks associated with cryptocurrency custody, given their existing compliance frameworks and security protocols.
Potential presidential veto
After the overwhelming support for overturning the SEC rule in Congress, the legislation now faces its final test on the desk of US President Joe Biden.
While the White House has indicated that the measure may be vetoed, citing concerns about disrupting the SEC’s work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets, proponents remain hopeful that Biden will recognize the importance of allowing regulated firms to engage in cryptocurrency custody.
Critics of the SEC’s rule argue that it stifles innovation and hampers the ability of financial institutions to meet the growing demand for cryptocurrency services. They point to the recent approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) by the SEC as evidence of the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies and the need for regulatory flexibility in this rapidly evolving space.
Senate decision met with enthusiasm
The decision to overturn the SEC rule has been met with enthusiasm by industry stakeholders, who see it as a positive step towards greater institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Many believe that allowing regulated financial firms to hold cryptocurrencies will help to legitimize the asset class and attract more institutional investors.
However, some industry experts caution that regulatory clarity is still needed to ensure the long-term stability and growth of the cryptocurrency market. They emphasize the importance of striking a balance between innovation and investor protection to foster a healthy and sustainable ecosystem for digital assets.

Bitcoin to $66,000 - Is this why CME Group is planning to launch BTC trading? - AMBCrypto



CME’s Bitcoin trading plan signals Wall Street’s acceptance of crypto
Surge in institutional investments highlights Bitcoin’s mainstream growth

It has been a good day for Bitcoin [BTC] after the cryptocurrency climbed as high as $66,333 on the charts after weeks of trading between $58k and $63k. In fact, at the time of writing, the cryptocurrency was up by 5.78% in the last 24 hours alone.
That’s not all as according to TradingView, Bitcoin currently accounts for approximately 56% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization.
Source: TradingView
CME Group turns to Bitcoin 
In response to the hike in Bitcoin’s dominance, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, the world’s largest Futures exchange, may soon reveal its plans to launch Bitcoin trading.
This move will be part of the firm’s strategy to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency sector and capitalize on the increasing demand from Wall Street money managers in 2024.
This is a welcome development for many in the crypto-space, with Alessandro Ottaviani, Co-Host @StoreofBitcoin, claiming,
“The ‘bending the knee to Bitcoin’ process is continuing.”
How can CME benefit from this move? 
Though the plans are still uncertain, CME Group’s initiative to introduce spot Bitcoin trading marks a pivotal step for Wall Street’s involvement in the cryptocurrency space. Coupled with the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs, it all signals growing regulatory acceptance.
Interestingly, with this move, CME could streamline basis trades by integrating spot Bitcoin trading with its established Bitcoin Futures market. This strategic move would enhance trading efficiency and reinforce the CME’s position in the cryptocurrency market.
This update comes within days of Michael Saylor, former CEO of MicroStrategy, commenting,
“There are thousands of pension funds in the United States managing ~$27 trillion in assets. They are all going to need some #Bitcoin.”
It also underlines Bitcoin’s evolving role from a niche digital asset to a mainstream financial instrument with significant institutional and regulatory support.
Not everyone is happy!
That being said, there are others who feel otherwise too. According to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, for instance,
“Crypto exchanges might lose some business with the potential debut of a bitcoin spot market on the CME, a global derivatives giant, as the present bull run is particularly driven by institutions, who prefer to trade on regulated avenues.”
If this were true, however, then major hedge funds like Bracebridge Capital and pension funds such as the Wisconsin Investment Board wouldn’t have contributed over $10 billion into investment vehicles managed by firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark.
The future looks bright though 
Hence, despite BTC falling by over 20% from its March peak of over $73,000, Bitcoin ETFs have rapidly become the fastest-growing ETFs in history.
Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, put it best when he said,
“Bitcoin is a great potential, long-term store of value.”

Crypto analyst touts U.S. money supply boost could propel Bitcoin

Analysts are eyeing a less conventional indicator to predict Bitcoin’s trajectory: the M2 money supply, where M2 corresponds to the total number of different currency and commercial paper units in circulation. This metric, the sum of all the marketable US cash and short-term money in circulation, has a trend similar to Bitcoin’s bullish cycles, thus creating doubt about its future role as an influencer in the market.Also read: Bitcoin bullish trendHistorical correlation of US money supply and  Bitcoin’s rallyAs with the markets and considering their historical data, the growth of M2 money supply may be a tool for boosting BTC’s rally. In referring to his recent analysis, Jamie Coutts, a crypto analyst, explains why strength in the US dollar is strongly correlated with weakness in cryptocurrencies. Among the multiple parameters Coutts mentions in his Bitcoin/Liquidity framework, M2 – a measure of the aggregate money supply in circulation globally—is the index globally showing the strongest association with Bitcoin’s bull cycleImportance of money supply rate change to BitcoinThe amount of money required will not be the most crucial point to this change, but the rate at which the amount is set. Coutts underlines that the speed of the M2 volume variations and Bitcoin price interrelations are the most significant factors here rather than absolute quantities.The central banks view a rise in this reading as a positive signal of a potential improvement in conditions. Developments related to the M2 money supply have become so significant that even investors cannot resist paying attention. By the end of May 2033, M2 money stock exhibited a positive increase in annual comparisons for the first time since November 2023. This turnaround hints at a possible channel control change as investors are convinced to invest less in assets like Bitcoin due to inflation.Source:ycharts Dollar dynamics and Bitcoin In addition to the M2 amount, which analysts watch for signs of a market catalyst, they also pay attention to the USD behavior, which is prone to have a big effect on the Bitcoin price dynamics. Also read: US dollar weakensCoutts mentioned that the dollar’s movement determines the direction of Bitcoin’s growth or fall, explaining that the slump below the 101 barrier will strengthen the upward trend.

                        The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to decide on spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On May 16, Billy Markus, co-founder of Dogecoin, voiced his doubts about their approval, saying that the SEC is “compromised” and may not approve the ETFs.Markus made his skeptical comment in response to an X post discussing the importance of the approval of spot Ether ETFs for the ecosystem and the potential impact of a negative decision on Ethereum. He tweeted a response that “nothing good will come out” of the spot ETH ETF application.Spot Ether ETF Approval “Not Important” to Drive Ethereum
Markus’ comment reflects a broader pessimism about the SEC’s ability to make fair and unbiased decisions regarding Ethereum and cryptocurrency.Given this, Markus believes the regulator’s decision on spot Ether ETFs won’t negatively impact Ethereum’s trajectory or the cryptocurrency market as a whole. The Dogecoin creator’s views also echo the prevalent skepticism surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs.Recently, finance lawyer Scott Johnsson suggested that Ethereum’s legal classification will play an important role in the upcoming ETF decisions.Johnsson’s view shows a key distinction in the SEC’s approach to Bitcoin and Ethereum.Ethereum’s classification is receiving more regulatory scrutiny than Bitcoin, where its security status wasn’t a major focus during spot ETF filings. This shows a shift in focus between the two cryptocurrencies, suggesting a changing regulatory process for digital assets.US SEC Previously Acknowledged Ethereum’s Non-Security Status
The upcoming decision dates for VanEck and ARK Invest’s applications for Ethereum ETFs, scheduled for May 23 and May 24, respectively, have sparked intense speculation within the crypto industry.The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs is not just about price movements; it also carries symbolic importance, solidifying crypto’s legitimacy as an asset class and reaffirming its role in the evolving financial industry.The trend toward regulatory clarity is evident, as seen in the SEC’s recognition of Ethereum’s non-security status through the approval of an Ethereum futures ETF for trading in October 2023. Thus, the SEC established a clear precedent for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.Experts believe any deviation from this path would create regulatory uncertainty and weaken market confidence.Hong Kong’s approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, as well as their trading, demonstrate the increasing global acceptance and recognition of the potential of Ethereum-based financial instruments.

Early Shiba Inu Investors Move Funds to New Token, Seeking 987% Profits / Source: Cryptonews
                        As Shiba Inu (SHIB) eyes a potential push higher following a recent bullish pattern breakout and amid positive news for its DeFi ecosystem, early investors are moving funds to a new token called 99Bitcoins (99BTC) as they seek 987% profits.SHIB was last trading down 3.3% on Thursday around $0.00002450, having earlier pushed towards $0.000026.The meme coin, the second largest by market cap after Dogecoin, broke out of a multi-week pennant pattern on Wednesday.Technical analysis suggests risks are tilted towards a retest of late-March highs.As SHIB eyes a possible near-term rally, a new token is attracting attention. Source: TradingViewAnd news that ShibaSwap has finally migrated to Shibarium could help ignite fresh bullish sentiment.Shiba Inu developers launched Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain designed to be the home of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, last year.But so far, it’s largely been a dud, with barely over $2 million in TVL as per DeFi Llama.ShibaSwap, Shiba Inu’s previously Ethereum-based DEX, has been more successful.The DEX routinely logs daily trading volumes in the millions of dollars, CoinGecko data shows.ShibaSwap’s expansion to Shibarium should bring some much-needed liquidity to the struggling blockchain.Not only is that a boost to the Shiba Inu web3 ecosystem, but should also lift the SHIB burn rate.Investors Move Funds to New Token 99Bitcoins (99BTC) – Here’s Why
SHIB could see near-term upside, but a new token in the learn-to-earn (L2E) niche is attracting a lot of hype.Well-established crypto education platform 99Bitcoins is launching a new token that will reward users for learning about crypto.And investors are flooding in to get in on the presale before it sells out.99Bitcoins’ has over 700,000 YouTube subscribers, over 100,000 enrolled students and a huge 2.5 million mailing list.That positions it to immediately become a leader in the L2E space.The new token will initially launch on Ethereum, but eventually, as BRC-20 to pioneer L2E on the Bitcoin blockchain.Investors have already piled nearly $1.3 million into the presale. And potential investors better move quickly, as when $2 million is hit, the 99BTC price will rise.99BTC will power 99Bitcoins’ L2E platform, whilst offering investors a healthy staking yield.As per the official website, this yield was last around 1,333%, though will drop quickly as the presale progresses.99Bitcoins is also running a whopping $99,999 BTC airdrop.Should new token 99BTC become a market leader, presale investors could easily be looking at 10x or 987% gains. This one is not to be missed.Buy 99BTC Here

DePIN is a lifeline for Bitcoin miners, says Livepeer CEO - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Bitcoin (BTC) miners might turn to the DePIN ecosystem to turn mining facilities profitable after the latest halving cut block rewards to 3.125 BTC, shared Livepeer CEO Doug Petkanics with Crypto Briefing. DePIN is short for decentralized physical infrastructure network, a blockchain industry sector that brings transparency and decentralization to the real world.Petkanics highlights that this movement to DePIN, where the business model is usually providing computing power through GPUs to artificial intelligence-focused companies, is met with good and bad news for Bitcoin miners.“The hardware that they’ve bought and deployed and paid for Bitcoin mining are really specific to Bitcoin. Their ASICs, they can only mine Bitcoin. They can only do that specific cash function. They really can’t be redeployed into other networks. I think that’s the bad news. But that’s not surprising. That’s what they knew their investment was and they knew they were optimizing for.”On the opposite side, the expertise and surrounding infrastructure that the facilities built up around mining crypto are really efficient when it comes to energy usage, bandwidth, and operational management, Petkanics points out. This characteristics can be proven useful when managing aThe expectation after the April 20 halving is that electricity and overall production costs will nearly double, according to a report by asset management firm CoinShares. The report also sheds light on that mining companies like BitDigital, Hive, and Hut 8 are already generating income from artificial intelligence (AI).“All that expertise and resources absolutely can be repurposed into one of the sort of biggest opportunities of this point in time that we’re in right now, due to the just massive amount of computing resources that are going to be required when it comes to this paradigm shift of artificial intelligence models being this new technology that’s changing everything about how people interact with technology.”Fostering developmentAccording to Livepeer CEO, decentralized computing power networks offer benefits in different layers. The first is related to how the GPU market is organized, where tech firms must buy large batches of graphic chips to achieve a cheaper acquisition price.However, these companies usually don’t have immediate usage for all the GPU acquired, and that’s where DePIN shows its potential by letting computing power be lent.“I think that actually fits really neatly into this notion that decentralized networks can let anyone who’s paid for that capacity, but has it sitting idle, make it available to developers that want to use it temporarily via open marketplaces.”Moreover, the necessity to buy large batches of GPU is also a threshold to companies such as data centers and infrastructure providers. This is also another issue that can be solved by DePIN, as these smaller companies can tap into the dormant capacities of these idle graphic chips via an open marketplace, Petkanics underscored.“You don’t have the overhead or the bureaucracy of needing contracts and customer relationships and sales and the stuff that adds a lot of cost on top of just sort of connecting directly to the computing power.”

PEPE Price Cooling Down From Highs: Is a Correction Coming?


PEPE price emerged as one of the most impressive tokens this bull run as the meme coin hit a new all-time high this week.
The meme coin craze, however, will result in profit-taking, which could lead to a considerable drawdown.
PEPE Investors Look to Sell

PEPE price breached the key resistance of $0.00001007, which enabled the meme coin to hit a new all-time high. However, this has also set the meme coin enthusiasts up for selling. This is because the investors are seeing solid gains at the moment.
According to the realized profits, PEPE holders note the highest gains recorded on the network in almost two months. Spikes in this metric are a sign of profit-taking, and this sentiment could extend to other investors as well.

This sentiment can already be observed taking over the investors upon distributing active addresses by profitability. Currently, over 40% of the investors participating on the network are witnessing gains.

This is the most profit-bearing PEPE holders have been active, dominating the active addresses. This translates to selling since these investors are looking to secure their gains.

Consequently, the PEPE price would take a major hit as selling ensues.
PEPE Price Prediction: A Downfall on the Cards?
PEPE price can be seen trading at $0.00001020 after forming the new ATH at $0.00001161. The meme coin is holding above the support at $0.00001007. Falling through this support will likely send PEPE down to $0.00000900.

If profit-taking intensifies, a drop to $0.00000750 is also likely.

However, if the PEPE holders decide not to sell but to HODL for further gains, the meme coin would have a shot at recovery. Bouncing off $0.00001007 would enable the PEPE price to climb to the new ATH again, invalidating the bearish thesis.

US Senators Propose $32 Billion Investment Plan to Boost AI and Tech Growth

                        A bipartisan group of four senators urged Congress to take bold, decisive action to secure American leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector on May 15.The senators’ AI investment plan, led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, is pushing for $32 billion in funding over the next three years to develop AI in the country.US Senators’ AI Investment Proposal Integrates Strategic Roadmap
In a 31-page document titled “Driving U.S. Innovation in Artificial Intelligence,” the group of two Democrats and Republican senators outlined a roadmap that would see the US take proactive steps to “harness the opportunities and address the risks” of the rapidly developing technology.The proposed funding would primarily cover non-defense applications of AI, though the senators are also considering a major allocation for defense-related AI projects. Additionally, they proposed funding for cross-government AI research and development, including initiatives for AI-ready data and government AI testing and evaluation infrastructure.“If China is going to invest $50 billion, and we’re going to invest in nothing, they’ll inevitably get ahead of us. So that’s why even these investments are so important,” Schumer stated.Many commentators believe the senator’s AI investment plan could help the country address increasing concerns about China’s advancement in the sector. Washington fears that Beijing could use AI for malicious purposes, such as meddling in the Presidential elections or launching cyberattacks.Additionally, the US lawmakers recommended the creation of a federal data privacy law and expressed support for legislation to prevent the use of “deepfake technology in election campaigns.” They also called for regulatory measures to address issues such as health and financial discrimination, job displacement, and copyright violations caused by AI.Commenting on the latest senator’s AI investment proposal, Amy Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota, expressed support for the recommended framework for AI, particularly in Journalism, where copyright infringement has been an issue.Lawmakers Express Concerns on AI Threat to Election
Meanwhile, US Senators are sounding the alarm about AI’s threat to elections, specifically its potential to deceive voters.To this end, the Senate Rules Committee advanced three bills on May 15 to combat this issue – the Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act, the AI Transparency in Elections Act, and the Preparing Election Administrators for AI Act.The Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act, introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar and co-sponsored by Senator Josh Hawley, would prohibit using AI video or audio related to federal candidates.The AI Transparency in Elections Act would require AI disclosures in political ads, while the Preparing Election Administrators for AI Act would develop guidelines to counter external AI threats, especially from foreign adversaries.Recent incidents underscore the importance of these bills. In February, a robocall impersonating President Joe Biden and a video from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ campaign last June using AI-generated images of former President Donald Trump have exposed the dangers of AI in elections.These incidents highlight the urgent need for measures to protect the integrity of democratic processes from AI-based deception, which the EU has also been working on.Recall that the EU set a precedent by passing the AI Regulation Act in March 2024 and has gone grill Big Tech on AI risks to elections.

                        JASMY has jumped by 12% today, with the Jasmy Coin price scaling to $0.02051 and outperforming the market as a whole, which is up by 5% in 24 hours.This price also means that JASMY has gained by 14% in a week, 24% in a fortnight and 17% in the past month, with the utility token outperforming other comparable coins over these timeframes.And with Jasmy as a platform continuing to grow steadily and welcome new partnerships and launches, the JASMY price could continue to rise consistently in the coming weeks.Jasmy Coin Price Prediction as JASMY Rockets Up 12% – Are Whales Buying?
JASMY has had a strong couple of days, with its indicators now showing plenty of momentum that could continue until the end of the week.In particular, its 30-day average (orange) jumped over its 200-day (blue) yesterday and is racing ahead, a sign of a breakout.Source: TradingViewJASMY’s relative strength index (purple) is also looking promising, having recovered from lower levels last weekend and hitting 80 yesterday.While it has dipped a little since then, it remains above 60 and could stay high for the next few days, as the coin’s price pushes up some more.It’s also highly encouraging the JASMY’s trading volume has risen to $100 million, which may be low in view of bigger tokens but is actually JASMY’s highest level in a month.The expectation is that JASMY will see continued gains in the near term, while its long-term picture also looks very bullish.This is because it’s the native token of Jasmy, a layer-one blockchain platform that has been gaining traction in recent months.Most famously, it announced a partnership in March with major electronics manufacturer Panasonic, with which it will be developing an Internet-of-Things platform.And with partnerships with other recognized names such as Nippon Travel Agency, such developments are likely to help Jasmy grow in stature and importance within the cryptocurrency sector.JASMY is therefore in line to benefit from its platform’s recent growth, while it will also benefit from the ongoing recovery and growth of the wider cryptocurrency market.It’s possible that the market could see another bull run in the next few months, particularly if the Federal Reserve announces rate cuts.Based on this, the Jasmy Coin price could hit $0.03 in the next few weeks and $0.1 towards the end of the year.Diversification with High-Potential Meme Tokens
Traders should be aware that JASMY isn’t the only low-cap alt in the market with promise, with a variety of newer meme tokens also looking ready to surge.While meme coins can be very hit and miss, one new example with strong fundamentals is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE).DOGEVERSE is a multi-chain meme coin that has raised over $15 million in its token offering, which is in its final phase before the token lists.Source: DogeverseWhat’s special about Dogeverse is that it’s the first ever Doge-themed multi-chain cryptocurrency.Accordingly, it will operate not only on Ethereum, but also on Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.This gives it some very strong potential, in that it could enter multiple ecosystems and gain usage on many more apps and trading platforms than it would have otherwise.As a token, it will have a hard cap of 120 million, which stands in contrast to tokens such as Dogecoin, which is infinitely inflationary.And when combined with a generous staking system, DOGEVERSE could become deflationary very quickly.VIDEONew investors can get involved in its presale via the official Dogeverse website, where 1 DOGEVERSE is selling at its final presale price of $0.00031.Once its sale ends, buyers will receive their tokens through Dogeverse’s airdrop, at which point they will be able to sell their coins (or hold) and potentially make a big profit.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Bitcoin ‘could’ consolidate for ‘4 or 5 months,’ but big cup and handle looks promising - Analyst

According to Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards, stock and crypto market seasonality, along with Bitcoin on-chain data, suggest that BTC price could consolidate for 4 to 5 months. In a new report, Edwards said that Bitcoin continues to oscillate within the cycle range highs in the $58,000-65,000 region, with continuous weekly closes above the $58,000 “supportive of the long-term trend continuation.”Likening BTC’s price action to gold, which formed a “massive cup and handle” pattern over the last 13 years, with the “cup” lasting four years, Edwards noted how Bitcoin appears to show the same chart pattern.Edwards noted that given the similarities between Bitcoin and gold, there is a possibility that BTC could spend “up to 9 months in the range high forming a cup before a measured move up.”Edwards said,“The technical picture remains bullish, provided the price holds above $58K. The longer we spend in the range highs, the more likely this structure will merge into a classic ‘cup and handle’ pattern, which would typically see strong price appreciation following.”BTC/USD weekly chart. Source: TradingViewDespite the promise of the cup and handle pattern, Edwards observed that Bitcoin’s Supply Delta and 90-Day Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metrics had formed rounded tops. Edwards explained that Capriole Investments uses each to identify cycle tops and that “we are at a comparable mid-cycle pit stop.” “Regardless, this chart is telling us to expect at least a few months (possibly up to 6 months) of sideways chop and volatility before trend resumption. We are at the two-month mark today.”Bitcoin Supply Delta and 90-day CDD.

Source: Capriole InvestmentsRisk-off describes a market sentiment where investors reduce their risk exposure and focus on protecting their capital. However, the report noted that “most of the other metrics still suggest this cycle has quite some room to run.”Related: Bitcoin analysis sees $74K next as BTC price tries to hold 7.5% gainsInvestment management firm ARK Invest corroborated Edward’s views, agreeing that Bitcoin is still bullish. ARK Invest analysts demonstrated that previous halving events set the stage for long-term momentum for BTC. The report noted that each halving has been a “precursor to upward momentum on a long-term time horizon,” adding,“Assuming a 3x Bitcoin price increase a year after the halving this time around might be too optimistic. That said, this chart highlights the case for Bitcoin’s increasing scarcity over a meaningful time horizon.”BTC performance since halving day.

DTCC's pilot project with Chainlink drives blockchain data to expand fund tokenization - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest securities settlement system, has completed a pilot project called Smart NAV in collaboration with blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK). Major financial institutions from the US also participated in the pilot.According to a report published by DTCC, the pilot was initiated to establish a standardized process for bringing and disseminating net asset value (NAV) data of funds across multiple blockchains. With the standardization, the tokenization of funds becomes easier and more efficient over time.The Smart NAV pilot, which included participants such as JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, BNY Mellon, and State Street, explored a digital extension to DTCC’s Mutual Fund Profile Service (MFPS I) to leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT) for data dissemination and consumption.By delivering structured data onchain and creating standard roles and processes, the pilot found that foundational data could be embedded into various on-chain use cases, such as tokenized funds and “bulk consumer” smart contracts, which hold data for multiple funds.The pilot successfully demonstrated the feasibility of integrating structured NAV data onto blockchains, ensuring consistency and accuracy. It also established automated data routing via smart contracts, promoting dynamic data management and preventing fragmentation through Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).Notably, the project had a limited impact on existing market practices by allowing clients to use current channels and providing automated access to historical data without manual record-keeping.Clients involved in the project gained the ability to consume price and rate data in real-time through new interfaces, including APIs and smart contracts. The new data consumption methods include real-time API services and smart contracts designed for single funds or bulk fund groups, enabling instant updates and facilitating various use cases, such as automated portfolio rebalancing.Once fully deployed, the Smart NAV would open opportunities for expanding the scope of data dissemination to include key reference data and other blockchain-triggered workflows. Such an infrastructure would provide the foundation for more streamlined and efficient operational processes across the financial industry, as tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) such as bonds, funds, and other traditional investments has become one of the most sought-after use cases for blockchain technology.

                        Thursday, May 16, 2024 – As the Solana price sets its sights on $200, it is meme coins like Sealana ($SEAL) that are making a splash, as its presale accelerates towards the finish line.Sealana has raised $1,230,000, with no sign that the appetite for SOL meme coins is letting up. The opportunity to catch a swim with the next big thing in Solana meme coins is too good to miss.Selling at a fixed price of $0.022, the new meme coin can be bought with SOL, ETH, USDT or USDC, as well as a fiat option using a bank card.From $WIF to new breed $MANEKI, Solana-based meme coins are all the rage as the Layer 1 Solana chain demonstrates a stability that was lacking in its earlier days and an efficiency and cheapness of transactions that threatens to leave Ethereum struggling to compete.Since March 12 Solana has been consistently outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the chart below shows:Notable antecedents to Sealana include both SLERF and newer slitherer Slothana ($SLOTH). The latter, in the space of a month, raised $15 million in its presale.Trading on Raydium and centralized exchanges Poloniex and XT.com with a top-10 exchange rumored to be named this week, SLOTH recently hit an all-time high of $0.056.Slothana token’s price appreciation is in no small part due to a token-burning mechanism that kicks in each time the price puts on another 1 cent.Although there are similarities between the approach of $SLOTH and $SEAL, which has led some to surmise that the two may have related teams, the fact that $SLOTH breached the $100m market cap on Tuesday won’t have gone unnoticed by $SEAL buyers.Sealana Is Part of Solana’s New Wave of Meme Coins
Meme coins continue to lead the crypto pack and that’s good news for those who have joined the Sealana colony.$SLOTH is up 26% so far today, valued at $0.0451. $CWIF (CatWifHat) is up 38% at $0.0000007759, and Book of Meme ($BOME) is printing $0.0123, at 15% higher. $SLERF, which famously managed to burn a chunk of its supply allocated to presale buyers, is not going anywhere, up 15% at $0.310.Elsewhere, a relative old-stager $BONK, the leader of the first wave of successful Solana meme coins, is 10% the better at $0.0000252.Over on the Base chain, $SHIBA is priced at $0.001805, up a chunky 30%. Meanwhile, $BONE is advancing 11% to $0.633 and four-month-old Solana darling $PONKE is climbing 14% to $0.245.YouTubers like presale expert Jacob Crypto Bury have Sealana right up there among the top picks for 100x returns.VIDEOMedia convergence in Bitcoin.com, Crypto Potato, The Economic Times and Cryptonews shows that the word is spreading fast, hence the quickening run rate for the presale.Solana is growing up fast and that’s great news for Sealana
If Sealana buyers need further confirmation that they are in the right place to find outsized return on investment, then a quick run through of the Solana Q1 report should get investors into a joyous flap.In the three months to the start of April, Solana’s average DEX trading volume increased 319% quarter on quarter to $1.5 billion.This is a reflection of Solana becoming the go-to destination for retail and, in particular, meme coin traders and investors.According to Messari, projects built primarily on Solana raised $89.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 – that works out to $2.5 million more than the amount raised in the whole of 2023.On the protocol side, the ecosystem launched its much-heralded token extensions technology, which makes SPL tokens even more configurable and useful. Extensions have been taken up enthusiastically by a number of stablecoin issuers, notably Paxos.The broader Solana ecosystem is expanding too. A new developer shop called Anza has been well received as has the founding of Colosseum, dedicated to encouraging the growth and adoption of Solana.Although there are still some teething pains given that Solana did have its first outage in almost a year, related to a legacy loader issue, it has done nothing to slow down the growth momentum of the chain.Indeed, the fact that usage has mushroomed, yet the network coped admirably, underscores its stability and approaching readiness for commercial prime time.Sealana and Dogeverse leading the way forward for meme coins
Sealana does not profess to be anything other than a meme coin. However, its potential to achieve virality demonstrates the solidity of the Solana technology.Its future success will also show how Solana can become the scaffolding that holds up highly engaged meme coin networks such as Sealana, able to sustain realtime decentralized value-transfer interactions that could end up encompassing hundreds of thousands of users.Sealana is fun, will likely explode in value and could be the future of meme coins that grow from pups into sea lions.Another coin alpha-hungry traders like the look of is the new multichain darling Dogeverse, which is taking meme coins in new directions with its six-chain bringing unrivaled interoperability to the scene.It is definitely worth a contribution, but after raising $15 million in double-quick time, Dogeverse is now in an oversale stage which means it could close at any time after already achieving its stated hard cap target. A listing will likely be coming in the next week or so. $DOGEVERSE is priced in its presale at $0.0003.Buy Sealana at the official website here.

Bitcoin Bulls Crush $93M Crypto Shorts As BTC Breaks $66,000


								Data shows a mass amount of short contracts have seen liquidation in crypto derivatives during the past day following Bitcoin’s rally above $66,000.
Bitcoin Recovery Has Triggered Large Derivatives-Related Liquidations
According to data from CoinGlass, the cryptocurrency market as a whole has observed a large amount of liquidations on the derivatives side over the last 24 hours.

“Liquidation” here naturally refers to the process that any contract undergoes after accumulating losses of a certain degree, where its platform has to close it up forcibly. Below is a table that shows the total amount of liquidation over the past day.

Looks like a large amount of contracts have been flushed during this period | Source: CoinGlass
As is visible, more than $135 million in cryptocurrency derivatives contracts belonging to over 52,000 traders were liquidated during this window.
This derivatives flush has disproportionately affected the short holders, as $93 million of their contracts were caught in it. In more concrete terms, 68.4% of the liquidations involved the shorts. This is natural because Bitcoin and other assets have seen green returns in the past day.
More than $42 million longs still managed to get liquidated despite the positive performance, suggesting that speculators jumped on with overleveraged positions when the surge took place. Still, they arrived too late and found liquidation when the initial leg-up cooled off.
As is usually the case, Bitcoin-related contracts contributed the most to this liquidation event, as the heatmap below suggests.

The breakdown of the liquidations by symbol | Source: CoinGlass
BTC’s $47 million liquidations significantly outweighed Ethereum’s this time, whose $16 million figure is more similar to Solana’s $12 million share. This would suggest the appetite for speculation around ETH has been unusually low recently.
A mass liquidation event like today’s is popularly known as a “squeeze.” During a squeeze, a sharp swing in the price triggers a large number of liquidations, which only feed back into the price move, thus unleashing a cascade of liquidations.
The shorts saw the most liquidations the past day, so the event would be called a short squeeze. Historically, such large liquidations haven’t exactly been rare in the cryptocurrency market.

This is because most coins can be quite volatile, and speculation is rife. Overleveraged positions can be quite risky in this market, so it’s not surprising that when volatility like today’s emerges, many traders get caught off guard.
The warning signs that liquidations would pop up had already appeared when the surge began yesterday, as the Bitcoin futures Open Interest, a measure of the total amount of open positions, had shown a rise.

The value of the metric appears to have gone up over the past couple of days | Source: CoinGlass
The chart shows that Open Interest is still high even after the surge, suggesting that the squeeze hasn’t been able to put off the speculators.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $66,000, up 8% over the past seven days.

BREAKING: Turkish Government Announces Another New Statement on Country's Cryptocurrency Law - Bitcoin Sistemi


AK Party Deputy Chairman and Head of Information and Communication Technologies Ömer İleri made new statements about the new cryptocurrency law.
Forward shared his post in order to clear up some of the confusion discussed in the public about the law.


Regarding TÜBİTAK's role in altcoin listings on cryptocurrency exchanges, İleri said the following:

“In principle, an approach has been adopted not to interfere with the crypto assets to be listed on the platforms. However, in order for the listings not to be random, platforms will be required to create a written procedure for determining the crypto assets to be traded on them. It is envisaged that the Capital Markets Board may regulate the principles and principles regarding the listing procedures. It will be determined by the CMB. “In the principles and principles, opinions of TÜBİTAK or other organizations may also be taken and technical criteria regarding the technological features of crypto assets may also be included. Therefore, an approach such as TÜBİTAK directly determining the assets to be listed is not included in the bill.”

Regarding the taxation of cryptocurrencies, İleri said the following:






The statement in the proposal, “Each year, one percent of all revenues of the platforms, excluding the interest revenues of the previous year, are paid to the Board and one percent to the TÜBİTAK budget by the end of May of the relevant year and recorded as income” relates to the payments to be made by the platforms. The bill does not include any tax regulations for end users who buy and sell through the platforms.

The institutional investment firm with $1.7 billion in assets under management (AUM) has made investments in several Web3 firms, including blockchain and non-fungible token (NFT) developer Dapper Labs, gaming studio Sky Mavis and the collapsed cryptocurrency firm Terra Labs.
The stolen funds are still missing and the perpetrators have not yet been arrested, but the firm already employed blockchain forensics analysts to find out how the money was stolen, according to people familiar with the matter.
Last year, BlockTower Capital also suffered nearly $1.5 million in losses when hackers exploited the decentralized exchange aggregator Dexible and stole the crypto assets of users who authorized the app to move their tokens.
Hacking incidents continue to plague the crypto space. According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, there were over 600 major hacks in the crypto industry last year, resulting in around $2.61 billion in losses. Of these, only $674.9 million were recovered.
Last month, the crypto space suffered from around 40 hacks causing around $60.2 million in financial losses.

‘Notcoin’ Trading Volume Tops $1 Billion in 2024's Biggest Gaming Token Drop - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsMore than four months after the game launched via messaging app Telegram, Notcoin debuted its NOT token Thursday via The Open Network (TON)—and the massive airdrop yielded the largest gaming token launch of 2024 so far, along with over a billion dollars worth of trading volume so far.The NOT token is currently trading at a price of approximately $0.0076, per data from CoinGecko, giving it a market cap of about $776 million with the entire supply of 102.7 billion tokens minted right from the start.Some 35 million players were able to claim NOT tokens from playing the game, plus Notcoin launched staking rewards campaigns through Binance and OKX earlier this week.Both CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap show the token price plunging soon after launch, as more and more players claimed their tokens and sold them into the market, though they disagree on how high the price went. CoinGecko points to a peak of $0.0215 while CoinMarketCap goes much lower at $0.0144.That’s reflected in the estimated size of the price drop, with CoinGecko showing NOT down 65% on the day, while CoinMarketCap says it’s down 48%. In any case, new crypto tokens often see volatile pricing right out the gate due to limited liquidity, and we’ve seen these types of tracking disparities with other recent launches as well.In any case, that also puts the token’s peak market cap at different levels, with CoinGecko pointing to a $2.21 billion market cap at the highest price, while CoinMarketCap says NOT peaked at a market cap above $1.48 billion.Either way, Notcoin stands well above the competition when it comes to this year’s biggest gaming token launches by market cap. The runners-up are Pixels (PIXEL), which peaked at $731 million according to CoinGecko, and Saga (SAGA) at a peak cap of $684 million.Notcoin trading has already topped the billion-dollar mark in a matter of hours, with CoinMarketCap reporting about $1.07 billion worth of trading volume. That makes it the 14th most-traded coin by that metric over the last 24 hours.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Revolutionary Voting Concluded in the USA: Decision is in Favor of Cryptocurrencies - What Will Happen Now? - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a landmark decision, the U.S. Senate voted to repeal the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) SAB 121 rule. This rule had previously prevented regulated financial institutions from storing Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Cancellation of this rule may now pave the way for these institutions to engage with cryptocurrencies more freely.
But the war is not over yet. The decision now goes to President Joe Biden, who last week expressed his intention to veto the Senate's repeal. If the president vetoes, the issue will go back to the House and Senate. Both chambers would need a two-thirds majority vote to override the veto, setting the stage for a significant legislative fight.



Sen. Cynthia Lummis celebrated the Senate's decision, calling it “a win for financial innovation” and “a clear challenge to the way the Biden administration and Gary Gensler are persecuting crypto.” He also emphasized the importance of this event, stating that “this is the first time Congress has passed independent crypto legislation” and promised that “we are just getting started.”
Meanwhile, Congressman Tom Emmer described the situation as “a policy conflict between the Executive and the American people.” He noted that the bipartisan passage of the repeal of SAB 121 by Congress indicates strong support for cryptocurrencies. But he warned that if Biden vetoed the resolution, it would show his willingness to “kill opportunity for Americans at the expense of Americans.”

Pump.fun pauses trading after apparent flash loan attack - Blockworks


Pump.fun was attacked Thursday by an exploiter who seemingly used flash loans to buy out the bonding curve. 
In a post on X, Pump.fun said that it was “aware” that the contracts were compromised and were investigating. 
“We have upgraded the contracts so the attacker cannot siphon any more funds. The TVL in the protocol right now is safe,” the team said. “We’ve paused trading — you cannot buy and sell any coins at the moment. Any coins that are currently in the process of migrating to Raydium cannot be traded and will not be migrating for an indefinite period of time.”
Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at Wintermute, analyzed the situation in a series of posts on X, saying that the key was compromised, “though the possibility of an inside job remains.”

Igamberdiev said that the amount lost by Pump.fun is “at least” 12,000 SOL, or roughly $2 million.
An account on X going by Stacc seemed to take credit for the attack, writing “I’m about to change the course of history” in a post. 
Stacc seemed to imply in his posts that he didn’t intend to keep the stolen funds, but rather planned to transfer the “remaining balances of bonding curves” to some token users. 

It’s not clear as of publication how Stacc was able to execute the attack, or if they’re distributing the balances to random people. 
As Blockworks previously reported, Pump.fun lets developers launch tokens without seed liquidity for a couple of dollars. Its revenue comes from users buying and selling tokens. 
Tokens that exceed market caps of $69,000 can then be listed on the Raydium DEX. 
This is a developing story.

Donald Trump Received $5 Million In Crypto Donations - But Not For His Election Campaign - Benzinga

Donald Trump has recently made headlines for his involvement with cryptocurrency. In early May, he hosted an NFTs event where he had dinner with supporters of one of his NFTs projects. At the dinner, he voiced support for cryptocurrency and that he wanted to create an environment where cryptocurrency companies could operate in the U.S. without fear of regulation. These comments came after Trump made millions on cryptocurrency from a handful of sources, all of which were free donations. Don't Miss:Trump first began earning cryptocurrency in late 2022, following the release of the Trump Digital Trading Cards NFTs collection. The project used Trump's name, image, and likeness to release 45,000 NFTs priced at $99 each. Trump received royalties for allowing the company, Collect Trump Cards, to release the collection. In total, Trump has received over 1,800 ETH from the project. In late 2023, Trump sold 1,075 of the ETH to generate proceeds of $2.4 million. Trump still owns over 800 ETH, currently worth $2.4 million. However, the ETH is not necessarily a donation, as Trump earned the royalties by allowing another company to market the NFTs. Trump has earned more than $5 million in donations from other cryptocurrency companies. Trump received 580,000 Maga Coin (TRUMP) tokens when the project launched in August 2023. The meme coin is focused on providing Trump supporters with a token to invest in that serves as "this kind of de facto betting market on the election for many investors," according to Steven Steele, the project’s marketing director. The founders of the project sent the tokens to Trump as a marketing ploy to show their support for the former president. Trending: Large boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets — has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?When Trump first received the tokens they were trading for less than $0.01 each, and the total position was worth just a few thousand dollars. However, as Trump has continued to make headlines, a memecoin craze has occurred, and the presidential race heats up, the price of the token has surged. In March 2024, the token reached an all-time high (ATH) of $11.56, which meant that Trump's 580,000 tokens were worth over $6.7 million. While the price of the token has since fallen, it has remained well above the $5 level and has performed well in May. The recent spike in price was likely due to comments Trump gave at the NFTs dinner event, where he said that "if you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, you better vote for Trump." Trump's current holdings in MAGA Coin are worth over $5 million. While it is unclear whether or not Trump will sell the position or even is aware of them, the amount is certainly noteworthy, considering that Trump's election bid has raised over $200 million in total.Read Next:

Spot Bitcoin trading coming to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange

Illustration: Benoit Tessier (Reuters)Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, will soon offer spot Bitcoin trading as crypto is becoming mainstream and demand is surging, reports the Financial Times.Nvidia stock has all-time closing high in its crosshairsCME is the world’s largest futures Bitcoin trading platform and has been in discussions with cryptocurrency traders to establish a regulated marketplace for spot Bitcoin trading. According to the report, EBS, a Swiss-based currency trading platform known for its strict crypto asset trading regulations, is expected to run the platform.Spot trading crypto involves buying or selling at the current market price, as opposed to futures which allows traders to bet on the up or down movement of cryptocurrency prices without actually owning them. While the volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices makes things tricky, spot trading poses a relatively low level of risk because traders are only exposed to their crypto’s price movements. Returns on spot trades, however, tend not to be as high as those from futures trading.Spot trading for Bitcoin on CME would enable traders to engage in basis trades, a strategy designed to profit from the small price differences between futures contracts and the underlying spot Bitcoin. The exchange has not commented in detail about the offer, but the move highlights how crypto has become more mainstream and how big financial players are taking an interest in it.The move follows the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, which allowed giant financial institutions, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and others, to jump into the new era of digital assets.

US Senate passes resolution overturning SEC crypto rule on banks

A majority of lawmakers in the United States Senate have passed a joint resolution calling for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to strike down a rule affecting financial institutions doing business with crypto firms.In a 60 to 38 vote on May 16, U.S. Senators passed H.J.Res. 109, a resolution nullifying the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121. The commission’s rule requires banks to keep customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets, with capital maintained against them — a measure many lawmakers and industry leaders have criticized as stifling innovation.“The tally, a stunning 60 ‘Yeas’ in the Senate vote, sends a strong signal that both houses of Congress, across the political divide, clearly disapprove of this rule,” said the crypto advocacy group Blockchain Association in a May 16 X post. Source: Senate.govOn May 8, before the resolution passed the U.S. House of Representatives, President Joe Biden said he intended to veto the bill to “protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.” If the U.S. President vetoes the legislation, it will return to Congress and require a two-thirds majority vote to pass again.“The threat of a presidential veto denies the fact that there is a growing awareness among the voting public, particularly young people, that crypto is something our elected officials should care about,” said the Blockchain Association.Related: Proposed US Blockchain Integrity Act would ban crypto mixers for 2 yearsThe vote represented an atypical bipartisan move by the U.S. Senate, split 51-49 in favor of Democrats. According to Senator Cynthia Lummis, it was the first time this session of Congress passed “standalone crypto legislation.” The White House did not immediately release a statement on the resolution passing.“It is clear there is overwhelming opposition to SAB 121, and I urge [President Biden] to reconsider his previous statement of intent to veto the resolution,” said Representative Mike Flood, who sponsored the resolution.The joint resolution could be a bellwether for a different crypto bill, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. The legislation clarifies the roles the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission would have in regulating digital assets. It passed out of committee in July 2023 and is expected to be introduced in the House for a floor vote in May.Magazine: ‘Crypto is inevitable’ so we went ‘all in’: Meet Vance Spencer, permabull

Are Bitcoin ETFs Poised To Reshape China’s No-Crypto Stance? - DailyCoin


        

Bitcoin ETFs have recently launched in Hong Kong.



Emerging reports have suggested that the launch may catalyze the embrace of crypto in mainland China.



Bitcoin ETFs have not been launched in China.




China, the powerhouse of the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, has maintained a consistently negative stance against the crypto industry over the past years. Despite contenders like Hong Kong and Japan vying for dominance as the leading Asian digital hub, mainland China remains firm in its anti-crypto stance.



However, the recent launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong hints at a potential shift for China.



Bitcoin ETFs in China?



Central to the speculation is a local media Caixin report on May 16, 2024, which stated that most Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF issuers’ headquarters are under Beijing’s regulatory authorities, which suggests their alignment with China’s regulatory requirements.




While the ETFs offered by three Chinese asset managers, Harvest Global Investments, Bosera Asset Management, and China Asset Management, are currently inaccessible to Chinese investors, they are expected to serve as a conduit for a more accessible and regulated crypto ecosystem.



“What I’m optimistic about is, with these rules and these regulations now in place, Hong Kong actually may find a way to be this bridge for China to Bitcoin and the greater crypto ecosystem in a way that’s safer, more controlled or regulated,” stated a Bitfarms executive to the South China Morning Post at the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong.



Reports that the ETFs may be heading to the Chinese stock exchange Stock Connect, as suggested by X user Richard Byworth in a May 1 tweet, further fuel the chances.







Byworth emphasized ongoing talks within the Hong Kong market, hinting at the possibility of providing access to the asset class and the ability to purchase investments with mainland China currency, the Yuan.




Another point of contention is Harvest Global Investments CEO’s reported emphasis on ongoing efforts to extend ETF offerings to mainland China investors over the next few years. However, despite the positive sentiment, China’s unwelcoming stance towards crypto charts a muffled outlook.



China’s Crypto Antagonism



While there is no outright ban on crypto in China, the Chinese government has continuously reiterated its disinterest in the industry.



Authorities imposed a comprehensive ban on everything from trading to mining in 2017, effectively curtailing all crypto-linked operations among crypto exchanges and investors.



Fraudulent schemes in the industry have further tightened the government’s no-crypto campaign. In February 2024, the Dalian Supervision Bureau of China Securities Regulatory Commission reminded the public to beware of illegal fundraising scams in the name of “virtual currency” opportunities. The commission asserted that such opportunities lure investors, discouraging them within its jurisdiction.



Nevertheless, the Chinese underground crypto space is thriving despite the ban, recording a $86.4 billion crypto transaction volume in January 2024.



On the Flipside




Despite the strict stance in the country, reports surfaced in January 2024, revealing that Chinese officials covertly use cold wallets for bribery.



Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs, launched on April 30, had a lukewarm debut.



In December 2023, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology expressed interest in Web 3 initiatives to advance the local digital landscape.




Why This Matters



Accepting Bitcoin ETFs in China would signify a significant shift in the region’s crypto landscape, indicating a potential easing of the government’s strict stance. Additionally, it could open up an additional pathway to the asset class, further fueling its growing adoption.

DCF Announces Passage of Proposal for Better Liquidity and Efficiency in Cosmos Network | Coinspeaker



The passing of Proposal #912 highlights the proactive and innovative spirit of the Cosmos community.

The Decentralized Cooperation Foundation (DCF) announced the successful passage of Proposal #912, a transformative initiative within the Cosmos network, a leading decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, aimed at improving liquidity and economic stability.
Proposal #912: Milestone for Cosmos Network
Recently approved by the Cosmos community, Proposal #912 introduces a robust framework for liquid staking. This initiative is designed to allow staked assets to be traded freely through derivative tokens, therefore enhancing the liquidity within the network. The passage of this proposal underscores the community’s commitment to continuous innovation and improvement.





The primary objective of the proposal is to optimize the utilization of staked assets by enabling their liquidity. Traditional staking involves locking up tokens to secure the network, which, while crucial for network security, reduces the liquidity of these assets. Liquid staking, however, allows these staked assets to be utilized in other financial activities, improving their efficiency and liquidity.
Implementation and Initial Phase
Proposal #912 directs the strategic allocation of 188,768 ATOM from the Cosmos Community Pool towards liquid staking on the Stride and Persistence platforms, expected to increase capital efficiency by 18%. This projection is based on the improved utility of staked assets, which can now participate in various financial activities without compromising the network’s security. If this initial phase proves successful, after a three-month pilot, an additional 6% of the ATOM tokens will be allocated, bringing the total to 10%.
The Role of the Inter Stable Token (IST)
Central to Proposal #912 is the strategic and expanded utilization of the Inter Stable Token (IST), integral to enhancing liquidity and maintaining economic stability across the Cosmos network. The proposal specifies the use of liquid-staked assets to mint IST from Inter Protocol with a 500% collateralization ratio, aiming to distribute these tokens across various liquidity pools and swapping half of the IST into USDC. These tokens will be provided to significant platforms like Osmosis, Astroport, Axelar, Shade Protocol, and Quasar Finance, projected to yield an overall estimated increase in efficiency of 18%.
DCF’s Commitment to Decentralization and Innovation
Ric Shreves, President of the Decentralized Cooperation Foundation, says:
“The passage of proposal #912 is a testament to the Cosmos community’s commitment to innovation and decentralized governance. We are proud to support such initiatives that align with our mission to promote blockchain solutions that are accessible, efficient, and equitable.”
Future Outlook
The passing of Proposal #912 highlights the proactive and innovative spirit of the Cosmos community. The successful implementation of this proposal is expected to set an example for future blockchain initiatives, stimulating further innovation within the Cosmos ecosystem. By deepening liquidity and increasing capital efficiency, the proposal strives to generate revenue for the Cosmos Hub community pool and benefit all ecosystem participants.

Crypto Analyst Predicts 100% Rise For Dogecoin To $0.3 As Major Metric Explodes | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin seems to have flipped into a bullish momentum, at least in the short term, prompting analysts to predict bullish outlooks in the short term. Particularly, DOGE is up by 7% in the past 24 hours and is still on a 14% increase in the past 3 days. 
Current price action shows the cryptocurrency is moving to break past a resistance level of around $0.16. A crypto analyst known pseudonymously as World Of Charts believes the potential of this breakout happening is very strong and DOGE is primed for a surge to a price target between $0.27 to $0.30, which represents a 100% surge on the upper end.
Major Dogecoin Metric Explodes
Doge is starting to turn bullish in a number of metrics, which in turn has increased investor interest. One of these metrics is the DOGE open interest across crypto exchanges. At the time of writing, Dogecoin’s open interest has spiked by over 12.47% in the past 24 hours to reach $883.89 million in the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass data.

Other metrics, such as an increase in derivates volume and a 14.4% increase in trading volume in the past 24 hours, also point to increased activity for DOGE, which in turn could lead to a significant price uptick. 
According to a 12-hour timeframe Dogecoin chart shared on social media platform X by World Of Charts, DOGE is on the verge of breaking out of a descending triangle. This chart shows DOGE has been on an interesting price action formation of lower highs with equal lows since the beginning of April. 
This form of descending triangle is particularly a strong bullish indicator for Dogecoin analysts, especially considering it started to form after a strong DOGE uptrend in February and March. When this pattern occurs within an established uptrend such as this, it generally indicates corrections before the trend continues.

The analyst remarked that DOGE is “on verge of another breakout.” As per his analysis, a successful breakout would push DOGE on the uptrend continuation and a move towards $0.27 to $0.30 for the first time since October 2021.
Despite going on an 182% price increase in February and March, DOGE is yet to break into $0.27 this year. The cryptocurrency peaked at $0.22 before spiraling down and correcting to $0.13, representing a 40% decrease.
At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.156 and could keep surging for the rest of the month. The first step before reaching $0.3 is to break above a resistance around $0.167, If DOGE can surge above $0.17 and the bulls hold this price level, it could continue climbing to $0.22 and beyond.

Global Liquidity Cycle Set To Push Crypto Into Next Massive Bull Market, According to Macro Guru Raoul Pal - The Daily Hodl


								Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal thinks the global liquidity cycle will drive crypto prices higher.
In a new YouTube video, Pal tells his 703,000 subscribers that there are currently macroeconomic sources of liquidity “everywhere,” including upcoming monetary policy choices from the U.S. Federal Reserve.










The Real Vision chief executive also notes that global liquidity increases in “crypto macro summers.”
“Obviously [in] 2020 it went bananas because of the pandemic. But 2016, 2012 – these were good periods for liquidity. And guess what? Crypto, technology, they all rose. Then you get into fall – fall is often when the real fireworks happen. Liquidity keeps pumping and eventually tops out into winter. That’s when you get the corrections, the crypto down cycles. So we’ve got the best two parts of the cycle to come.”
Pal says he’s “pretty much 100%” invested in Solana (SOL) right now, plus a few small memecoins and “other bits and pieces.”
 “The Solana/Bitcoin cross chart [and] the Solana/ETH cross chart look so compelling that I’m like, ‘If my job here is to make as much money as possible, I’m just going to own the thing that I think is going to go up the most.'” 
Solana is trading at $160.33 at time of writing and is up 13.5% in the past 24 hours.

The Curious Case of Bitcoin L2s | Bankless


Bitcoin has had an explosion in development.New primitives like Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20s are taking center stage. This marks a big shift in the vibe of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It’s evolving from being lazer-eyed on BTC as an asset to a more dynamic ecosystem that has different things for people to use, build, and speculate on.Within the Bitcoin ecosystem, L2s are now the new hot thing. Everyone wants a piece of the Bitcoin L2 pie. But what’s the hype all about?In today’s story, we’re zooming out for a full view of the Bitcoin L2 scene. We’ll be answering key questions for those new to the concept of Bitcoin L2s: the necessity of L2s, their present condition, what lies ahead, and their eventual end state. Let's dive in! 👇Why Bitcoin Needs L2sThe Bitcoin network is designed to prioritize security and decentralization, making tradeoffs around its scalability and expressivity as a blockchain. While this makes BTC a more valuable asset, it also means that the network is not the ideal infra for building financial apps, as seen on Ethereum.For almost a decade, the Bitcoin community has grappled with scalability issues, with transactions costing tens of dollars during peak network traffic. And today, the demand for Bitcoin’s block space is exploring new heights, driven by experiments like Ordinals,  Runes, BRC-20s:The vision for Bitcoin is to be universally accessible and adopted. To make that happen, it must scale to handle more traffic without costing a fortune per transaction. The rising demand for Bitcoin’s block space underscores the need to scale Bitcoin, reflecting demand for Bitcoin L2s.The Bankless Guide to Lightning Network on BanklessUpdated: Dec 2023The Current State of Bitcoin L2sThe Bitcoin community has been actively working to improve transaction scalability for many years. A key development in this area is the Lightning Network – a payment channel protocol aimed at enabling faster and more affordable transactions by processing them outside of the Bitcoin L1.The Bankless Guide to Lightning Network on BanklessUpdated: Dec 2023While the Lightning Network has long been the flagship solution for Bitcoin’s scalability vision, the community is increasingly recognizing its limitations. There’s a consensus forming that the Lightning Network might not be the definitive scaling solution for Bitcoin, and there’s a need for better Bitcoin L2s.Eric Wall discussed this need for improved L2s on a recent Bankless episode, suggesting that the future of Bitcoin's scalability may lie beyond what the Lightning Network currently offers.But where does this bring us? How can we build more effective Bitcoin L2s?VIDEOBitVM's Trust-Minimized PromiseCurrently, the spotlight is on BitVM, a new model for executing Turing-complete contracts on Bitcoin that could pave the way for optimistic rollups on Bitcoin.The main reason why the community is rallying behind BitVM over any other approach stems from its compatibility with the Taproot upgrade. This means BitVM can be deployed without further modifications to the Bitcoin network — preserving the network's existing rules. A win-win for all types of people in the Bitcoin community.BitVM's approach involves off-chain execution of transactions with the functionality to verify them onchain within the challenge window through fraud proofs, a mechanism akin to Ethereum's optimistic rollups. This system can operate even with a single Prover but has the trust assumption that there must always be at least one honest verifier in the system that can detect and broadcast malicious transactions. However, this also means that if all Verifiers were compromised, the integrity of Bitcoin would be at risk since the attacker could post fraudulent transactions on the network. Simplified Diagram of the Operation of BitVM. Source: The Bitcoin L2 OpportunityBitVM only allows the creation of trust-minimized Bitcoin L2s like optimistic rollups, and not trustless Bitcoin L2s like ZK-rollups. Moreover, similar to optimistic rollups on Ethereum, BitVM faces challenges such as lengthy dispute resolution times and the necessity for operators to lock up significant capital to ensure liquidity for potential withdrawals. Consequently, there’s a degree of skepticism in the Bitcoin community regarding BitVM’s practicality. But it’s worth noting that BitVM is still in its early stages of development and holds promise for scaling Bitcoin through optimistic rollups.VIDEOZero-Knowledge DreamsThis brings us to the main question – what’s the end-state of Bitcoin L2s? The answer is, ZK-rollups! But building ZK-rollups on Bitcoin isn’t easy, or even technically possible right now… this would necessitate changes to the Bitcoin network through a soft fork, and we all know that’s easier said than done. The soft fork would add a new opcode to Bitcoin, which would enable it to natively recognize and verify zero-knowledge proofs, allowing for trustless interactions between Bitcoin and the rollup. However, as mentioned above, this is a major technical hurdle and its feasibility remains uncertain.But, wait a minute. Given that BitVM is still early, and neither optimistic nor ZK-rollups are currently possible on Bitcoin, how do we have so many Bitcoin L2s in the ecosystem already?Well, the reality is that, technically, real Bitcoin rollups don’t exist yet. What we’re seeing is a bunch of dedicated teams laying the groundwork for future Bitcoin L2s.BOB’s phase-wise approach to building a Bitcoin L2. Source: BOB official websiteFor example, some rollup teams, like BOB, are taking a phased approach. They’ve started by bootstrapping an ecosystem as an EVM rollup, attracting users, liquidity, and applications. Then, they plan to transition to an optimistic rollup using BitVM once the technology matures, and eventually, they aim to evolve into a zk-rollup, contingent on if Bitcoin undergoes a soft fork to add the necessary opcode.Closing ThoughtsWith great hype comes great potential for scams. Amid the buzz, there are many projects falsely claiming to be Bitcoin L2s, so it's important for investors and users to remain cautious. The jury is still out on whether many self-proclaimed projects are actually L2s or if they are merely using buzzwords to attract venture capital and retail investment.Nonetheless, these are exciting times for the Bitcoin community. From the launch of the Bitcoin spot ETF, which marks a milestone in institutional adoption, to primitives like Ordinals, BRC-20s, and Runes, the Bitcoin ecosystem is experiencing unprecedented growth and innovation. The prospect of Bitcoin L2s adds to the excitement about the future of Bitcoin.🗣️ What's your take on the potential impact of Bitcoin L2s on BTC adoption overall? Do you think they’re here to stay, or just a fleeting trend?8 Bitcoin L2s You Should Be Watching on BanklessBitcoin’s L2 narrative is scaling up quickly

Crypto Analyst Looks Ahead for Bitcoin After BTC Breaks Downtrend - The Daily Hodl


								One widely followed crypto analyst says Bitcoin’s latest rally is turning an old BTC resistance into new support.
Pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 468,200 followers on the social media platform X that BTC’s 2% leap in the last 24 hours could be the end of a downtrend.










“BTC is breaking its Daily Downtrend”

According to the analyst, the $60,000 price zone was acting as a barrier to BTC. However, Rekt Capital now believes that the barrier has now been flipped to a foundation.
“Bitcoin has successfully turned the old major resistance into a new major support.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
According to the crypto analyst, BTC’s downtrend has been one month in the making.
“Bitcoin has broken its Daily Downtrend which started one month ago in mid-April
When downtrends get broken, uptrends occur
Bitcoin has finally recorded its first Higher Higher since bottoming at $56,000.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
The analyst also says that BTC is on track to reach a bull market high in the fall or winter of next year.
“In the 2015-2017 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 518 days after the Halving
In the 2019-2021 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 546 days after the Halving
If history repeats and the next Bull Market peak occurs 518-546 days after the Halving…
That would mean Bitcoin could peak in this cycle in mid-September or mid-October 2025
Currently, Bitcoin is accelerating in this cycle by approximately 200 days now
So the longer Bitcoin consolidates after the Halving, the better it will be for resynchronizing this current cycle with the traditional Halving cycle.”

BTC is worth $65,842 at time of writing, up 7% in the last seven days.

Alameda's Sam Trabucco Resurfaces to Defend FTX Exec Ahead of Sentencing - Decrypt

Ryan Salame, the former CEO of FTX Digital Markets, says he had nothing to do with the massive fraud that lost the exchange’s customers over $10 billion—and his “best friend” Sam Trabucco, who once led Alameda Research, has attested to that in writing.In a Tuesday court filing, Salame’s lawyers argued that their client was “not part of Sam Bankman-Fried’s innermost circle” who knew about the fraud at the center of the case. They compiled letters from Salame’s friends and family attesting to his “generous” and “caring” nature.“Simply put, Ryan is my best friend,” Trabbuco wrote in a letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan. “He has also committed crimes. He's acknowledged that and is prepared to accept the consequences.”In September, Salame became one of many FTX leaders to enter a plea deal with the Department of Justice (DOJ) following the exchange’s downfall, forfeiting $1.5 billion in the process. That guilty plea related to campaign finance violation charges rather than fraud, however, and Trabuco said his friend’s punishment should fairly reflect that.“Ryan doesn't deserve to be defined by his worst actions,” he said. “He's a complex person who made mistakes, not some one-dimensional villain.”Troy Tsui, another friend and former co-worker of Salame’s at Alameda Research, backed the latter’s “fundamentally decent” character. Another letter from his mom and dad said that “at his core, Ryan seeks to be a catalyst for good in the lives of others.”Going beyond Salame’s character, lawyers noted how even Caroline Ellison—the CEO of Alameda Research and Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend—testified at the latter’s fraud trial that they had “conspired to keep Ryan in the dark about their fraud.”While on the witness stand speaking against her former partner, Ellison said that she “knew that FTX could not meet all withdrawals” during the week of its collapse. However, Bankman-Fried instructed her to tell Salame then that “we can meet a ton, though it’s already getting large.”Salame’s legal team also cited a letter from the Securities Commission of the Bahamas stating that he was the first to inform the commission that client assets at FTX had been transferred to Alameda Research.“The Commission understood Mr. Salame as advising… that such transfers were not allowed and therefore may constitute misappropriation, theft, fraud or some other crime,” the commission stated. The only people with the power to move funds like that, according to Salame, were Bankman-Fried, engineering director Nishad Singh, and FTX co-founder Gary Wang.“For the reasons stated above, a sentence of no more than 18 months’ imprisonment is sufficient,” Salame’s lawyers concluded.His sentencing hearing is scheduled for May 28.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitcoin ETFs attract 937 professional firms in Q1: K33 Research - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) appeared in 937 professional firms’ 13F filings in the US, shared Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research. In stark contrast, gold ETFs only saw investments from 95 professional firms in the same period, according to data from Bitwise. Retail investors continue to hold the majority of the float, but professional investors accounted for over $11 billion in exposure by quarter’s end, which is 18.7% of the total Bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM).The trend indicates that larger ETFs are generally more attractive to institutional investors. Notably, ARKB and HODL ETFs have experienced a higher degree of institutional backing, largely due to allocations from prominent firms such as ARK and VanEck.Among the professional firms that held Bitcoin ETF shares are JPMorgan, UBS, and Wells Fargo. Even the State of Wisconsin Investment Board revealed its holdings of over $99 million worth of BlackRock’s IBIT at the end of the first quarter. However, as highlighted by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the 13F Forms are a “snapshot” of these institutions’ holdings as of March 31, and they don’t account for short positions and derivatives.After the US inflation numbers came within the expected, investors turned to ETFs again. As reported by the X user Lookonchain, 9 ETFs added 3,893 BTC to their holdings, which is nearly $256 million.Grayscale’s GBTC registered an outflow of 839 BTC, while Fidelity added 1,989 BTC to its holdings. BlackRock’s IBIT is inching closer to GBTC, falling less than 14,000 BTC short with its 274,755 BTC under management.

Harvard built hacker-proof quantum network in Boston using existing fiber cable

Physicists at Harvard University have built what they believe is the world’s longest secure quantum communications network using 22 miles of currently existing fiber-optic cables.The experiment, published in the scientific journal Nature, connected two functional quantum computer nodes to each other through a strange physical phenomenon called “entanglement.” This allowed them to share data across the 22-mile distance in a paradigm that, according to the laws of physics, is unhackable. Source: Can Knaut via OpenStreetMapQ-DayThe world is currently embroiled in a technological race to shore up global computer security ahead of “Q Day,” a hypothetical point in the near future when bad actors will have access to quantum computers powerful enough to shred current encryption methods. While major institutions such as banks, military installations and the healthcare industry have already begun adopting protocols to protect data, there currently exists no functional replacement for data transmission.Essentially, no matter how well-encrypted data is, any time it is transmitted, there’s a risk of unwanted interception. Quantum computers and quantum networking have the potential to eliminate this risk due to the nature of how quantum data is handled. Quantum networkingData cannot be copied in a quantum system. This is because quantum data is extremely brittle. The slightest permutation, including something as innocuous as performing a simple scientific measurement, changes the data, rendering it unusable. Since quantum data can’t be copied, it cannot be transmitted from one node to another in the traditional sense. Instead, it must be “entangled,” at both points. This is accomplished using diamonds with a specific kind of flaw at their “hearts” that allows scientists to exploit a vacuum space to entangle quantum information. Simply put, quantum mechanics allows for the teleportation of data but not the transmission. Because of this, the big fear isn’t that bad actors will build quantum systems to intercept data — we could be decades away from even the most well-funded adversarial organizations having access to quantum systems — but that legacy data, encrypted with nonquantum protections, will be stolen from today’s systems and transmissions and then stored for decryption at a later date when bad actors can find some way to access a modern quantum computer system. In the meantime, the experimental quantum network systems being built today could one day serve as the primary medium for the distribution of sensitive data.Rather than, for example, sending financial transaction information through the typical banking “wires,” or legacy networks, institutions could store data in well-protected data centers and only “send” it to other institutions or stakeholders via quantum entanglement, where there’s absolutely no chance of hacking. This could have massive implications for the decentralized finance community, as the idea of “owning” data could be upended by a paradigm where access is inextricably confined to entangled nodes. In this way, it’s conceivable that digital assets such as cryptocurrency could be secured against all forms of network-based attacks.

Critical Bitcoin Price Report from JPMorgan - They Revealed BTC Level Needed for Miners to Keep Profiting - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to a research report published today by JPMorgan (JPM), the current hashrate and power consumption of the Bitcoin (BTC) network indicate that the estimated mining cost is approximately $45,000, a significant decrease from the previous cost of $50,000.
JPMorgan had previously predicted a significant drop in hashrate following the halving, as unprofitable miners would be forced to leave the network. This prediction is now coming true, albeit with a slight delay. The four-year halving, a process that slowed the growth rate of Bitcoin supply by reducing miner rewards by 50%, took place last month.


The term “hashrate” refers to the total combined computing power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain. The report suggests that the delay in hashrate decline is most likely due to the launch of the Runes protocol, a next-generation form of tokenization on the BTC network, resulting in a temporary increase in transaction fees.
“The Runes protocol provided a temporary boost to miner revenue in the immediate aftermath of the Bitcoin halving,” wrote analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. “Bitcoin miners were able to offset the loss in new BTC issuance reward due to the halving, along with the increase in transaction fees, keeping block rewards for miners virtually unchanged,” they added.





However, support from Runes was short-lived. User activity and fees for this protocol have dropped significantly over the past week or two. The authors noted that “this heightens the ongoing challenge that Bitcoin miners face to maintain a sustainable source of income, especially in the post-halving environment.”

As market excitement for the Runes protocol faded and temporary support for miners dissipated, the network's power consumption dropped more than its hashrate. According to the bank, this indicates that unprofitable miners with inefficient machines are leaving the network.


The report also highlighted a feedback loop regarding the BTC price. “The further the Bitcoin price falls, the greater the number of unprofitable miners who come under pressure to leave the Bitcoin network, and the greater the resulting drop in hashrate and bitcoin production, i.e. mining cost,” the report said.
In the near term, JPMorgan predicts a limited upside for BTC due to several previously identified hurdles, including a lack of positive catalysts and the disappearance of retail investor buying appetite.

FTX Creditors are Taking What's Theirs, Which is Good News for FTT - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Common Units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:GBTC) - Benzinga

It was a good week for FTX creditors, words not many thought would be written at the end of 2022 after the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy. But the tides have turned for the defunct entity. For one, crypto asset prices were essentially at their lowest when FTX went under, and its crypto holdings are worth a lot more now than they were before. The bankruptcy estate has managed to sell off shares in GBTC GBTC, its stake in the AI startup Anthropic, and its locked Solana SOL/USD tokens, all of which helped it rake in funds to pay back creditors. Read the full story at The Block.Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Senate passes resolution to overturn SAB 121 - Blockworks


The US Senate on Thursday passed Joint Resolution 109, which seeks to overturn the Security and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. The legislation now heads to President Joe Biden’s desk, where it is expected to be vetoed.    
Twelve Democratic Senators voted in favor to pass the resolution Thursday: Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Gary Peters of Michigan, Jon Tester of Montana, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. 
SAB 121, introduced in March 2022 and enacted the following month, states that digital asset custodians should report a liability and “corresponding assets” on their balance sheets for all custodied cryptocurrencies. The practice, SEC staff said, is intended to guard against the “significant risks and uncertainties associated with safeguarding crypto assets.” 
Last week, in the Republican-controlled House, 21 Democrats voted in favor of passing the resolution. The White House said last week that should the legislation make it to President Joe Biden’s desk, he would veto it.

“SAB 121 was issued in response to demonstrated technological, legal and regulatory risks that have caused substantial losses to consumers,” the Biden administration wrote in a statement. “By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, it could also inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate guardrails and address future issues related to crypto assets including financial stability.”
The president has ten days, excluding Sundays, to veto or sign off once it reaches his desk. 
Rep. Wiley Nickel, D-N.C., who co-sponsored the resolution, on Wednesday asked SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to repeal SAB 121 ahead of the Senate vote. 
Read more from our opinion section: It’s time to overturn SAB 121
“Today’s Senate vote to repeal SAB 121 sends a clear bipartisan message: Congress will not stand idly by as Gary Gensler and the SEC deliberately sidestep the statutory rulemaking process and overstep their regulatory authority,” Nickel said Thursday in a statement. 
The SEC did not immediately respond to Blockworks’ request for comment.

'The Hat Is Covering The Eyes Of WIF Holders': Veteran Trader Doubles Down On Meme Coin Bear Thesis - Benzinga

Popular crypto trader DonAlt has voiced his bearish outlook on Dogwifhat WIF/USD and the broader meme coin market in a series of tweets, expressing concerns over market saturation and the current state of Bitcoin BTC/USD.What Happened: DonAlt humorously begins by addressing the recent volatility surrounding WIF. "Pretty sure the hat is covering the eyes of WIF holders and they’re accidentally pressing the wrong buttons trying to liquidate me," he quips. He warns, "Once that’s fixed and they can see again I’m getting ready to get rekt," indicating his readiness for a potential downturn.He outlines several reasons for his bearish stance on meme coins, starting with the sheer volume of memes. "There are infinite memes already," DonAlt points out, highlighting the oversaturation in the market. This influx dilutes the value and potency of individual meme coins, making it difficult for any single meme to stand out and maintain long-term value.He further underscores that the technical outlook for meme coins is discouraging. "Charts don’t look so good across the board," DonAlt observes, indicating that the broader memecoin market is underperforming. Coupled with heavily skewed bullish sentiment, he cautions that the market might be setting up for a reversal.Also Read: Star Trader Points Out Four Key Factors Of Successful Meme Coins: Dogecoin, Dogwifhat, Michi Are ‘Relatable Memes’Why It Matters: DonAlt critiques the current Bitcoin price levels, asserting that the influx of speculators has exacerbated the problem. He thinks that at current Bitcoin price levels, almost all people "willing to buy objectively bad meme coins" have entered the market.The trader also notes the prevailing market sentiment that links the GameStop rally to the meme coin sector. "Bunch of people bought into the GME -> Meme rotation narrative," he states but dismisses the idea as a misguided analogy. This narrative has driven many investors to expect similar explosive growth, which DonAlt sees as unrealistic given current market conditions.In his conclusion, DonAlt highlights the need for either a significant rally in Bitcoin or a massive liquidity injection to rejuvenate the market. "You’d either need BTC to giga print to attract outsiders in or a massive liquidity injection," he suggests.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: This Trader Sees A ‘Barbell Portfolio Of BTC And Memes’ As Most Profitable Trading StrategyThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Synthetic Dollar Slump | Bankless


Fall from Grace. The token of synthetic dollar stablecoin issuer Ethena underwent an impressive post-launch surge, but once the initial rally petered out, ENA found itself caught in a perpetual downtrend! Why has ENA continued to plunge, and what moves is the team making to bolster adoption of its stablecoin? ENA achieved all-time highs in both dollar and BTC-denominated terms on April 11, a mere two days before USDe reached peak supply and broader risk markets took a turn for the worse, seemingly plunging on concerns of elevated conflict in the Middle East.While funding rates on the BTC and ETH perpetual swaps (the predominant source of Ethena’s revenue) cooled significantly coming into April, speculation over the impending second wave of ENA airdrop rewards fueled demand for Ethena assets and allowed yields to remain elevated.This bastion of return support has since crumbled, with fixed yields on USDe swaps from Pendle compressing to 29% from the 100%+ levels seen at the beginning of April.In recent weeks, mounting evidence has begun to suggest that crypto markets may have shifted into a more negative funding rate regime, with funding rates dipping negative for persistence periods of time throughout April and into May.Source: CoinGlassAlthough extremely elevated funding rates as BTC smashed into all-time highs the first two times turbocharged returns on Ethena’s delta-neutral strategy and resulted in an influx of deposits, negative funding rates have begun to eat into yields, reducing the attractiveness of holding USDe and creating concern about future outflows.Due to fact that net negative funding rates would cause the depositors to incur a loss, Ethena established an insurance fund at its inception, which receives a portion of the yield generated and has accrued $39.4M in reserves to safeguard against losses on $2.32B in outstanding USDe liabilities, a meager 1.7% buffer.Today, Ethena announced that it would be reducing the portion of revenues that it retains for the insurance fund from 50% to 20%, allowing returns on sUSDe to nearly double to 37% APY, a change that is expected to last until at least June and coincides with Ethena’s Bybit integration, which will enable users on the CEX to utilize USDe as trading collateral.
Funding rate compression has clearly taken a toll on Ethena, forcing the Protocol to adopt increasingly drastic measures to promote adoption of its dollar-pegged assets. Unfortunately, this most recent action is but a half-measure, providing a fleeting distraction from underlying fundamental issues. Even at a 50% take rate, the Ethena insurance fund was woefully inadequate to compensate depositors for losses from a prolonged period of negative funding rates. Institutional players have begun arbitraging the basis between spot BTC and futures contracts, indicated by the holdings of spot BTC ETF among hedge funds, increasing competitiveness for the types of trades utilized by Ethena and squeezing profit margins.Should crypto truly be transitioning into a more negative funding rate environment, ENA will continue to struggle and it is likely that Ethena will be forced to tap the insurance fund, the depletion of which could spawn a crisis of confidence about the backing of USDe.

                        Thursday, May 16, 2024 – Sponge ($SPONGE), a popular new meme coin that has brought early supporters returns of 10,000%, has launched a social media poll asking the community for direction on how to distribute the project’s lucrative staking rewards.The poll will run from May 16th to May 21st. It asks the Sponge community to decide between accessing the large volume of staking rewards immediately when the claim goes live at the end of May, to lock them for one month, or to vest the reward tokens linearly over either six months or a year.Sponge recently moved from Ethereum to Polygon. As a result, there are three groups eligible to collect tokens through the claim process: those who bought tokens through the presale widget, those who bridged to Polygon before February 5th, and holders who didn’t bridge but who manually moved into a claim contract following a snapshot taken on February 5th after the $SPONGE V1 token was discontinued.Those who held the V1 token on centralized exchanges before its discontinuation had their tokens swapped for the V2 token on Polygon, which also has $SPONGE as its ticker.The team explained the pros and cons of each choice in the poll in a separate X post.Staking rewards are just one reason investors are moving to Sponge in a bid to catch some potentially explosive price action before the presale concludes at the end of May.What’s Different About Meme Coin Sponge?
With global crypto adoption continuing apace, investors are buying up Sponge before it gets listed on major exchanges in the hope that they’ve found the next viral Web3 meme coin.$SPONGE is a unique project that comes with its own staking and video gaming community. In the coming weeks, people can expect two significant milestones: the long-awaited claim of the new Polygon $SPONGE token, and the release of an upcoming Sponge play-to-earn (P2E) gameMeme coins have been rallying and falling harder than most through Bitcoin’s 2024 rebound. The unpredictable price movements on all sides leave the industry wondering if it’s on the verge of another bull run.Any crypto meme project that wants to survive the Darwinistic survival-of-the-fittest pre-adoption market has to offer a little more than just laughs if it’s aiming for longevity.Investors believe $SPONGE is one such speculation. When it launched in May 2023, $SPONGE was priced at $0.000025. In less than a year, it has posted recent highs of $0.002763, or around 10,000% higher!Clearly, early-stage supporters are beginning to care about $SPONGE.$SPONGE’S Voyage So Far
Launched with little-to-no fanfare, $SPONGE V1 won the hearts of investors by offering an alluring ecosystem with lots of opportunities for participants to put their time and money to work to claim staking rewards.Foregoing a traditional prelaunch ICO in favor of direct listing, $SPONGE bounded out the starting gate with a discreet listing on Uniswap, before quickly spreading to centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Poloniex, MEXC, LBank, Gate.io, Toobit, and more.$SPONGE rallied a humbling 4,000% and nearly hit a $100 million market cap less than a week after launch, on May 9th 2023.The token recently upgraded (and migrated) to a V2 on Polygon, an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution. It is currently $0.001689 in a presale relaunch. This means those that held $SPONGE since the V1 launch, when it was priced at $0.000025, are now in profit by 6756%.Although the move had been in the pipeline since January, a recent liquidity pool attack expedited it.Still, the migration actually furthered the team’s plans by allowing it to deploy a huge early update to the protocol’s staking model and moving forward the still-unconfirmed launch date of the token’s eponymous P2E racing game.$SPONGE’s Mission To Soak Up Value
$SPONGE’s V2 upgrade introduced a couple of key improvements, the foremost of which being a new staking model.This rate yield varies according to the number of stakers and tokens locked up and currently sits at around 335%.Meme coiners expect the number of staked tokens to increase in the coming weeks, particularly as Sponge gains even more traction within the meme sector.That’s because the team hopes to list $SPONGE on some of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges, like Binance and OKX. The move could catalyze further explosive price action as the token becomes more accessible to everyday retail buyers.After claim and potential CEX listings comes the Sponge-themed game, where players can race around Bikini Bottom collecting rewards.With its dual-revenue staking and gaming model, $SPONGE is looking to seriously disrupt low-utility larger market cap rivals like $PEPE, $DOGE and $WIF.Take advantage of this window of opportunity to buy and stake $SPONGE before exchange listings take the project mainstream.Stay updated and join the engaged community of 37,300 followers on X.Buy And Stake SPONGE On The Website

Ripple Seeks to Seal Documents from SEC: This Is Why - DailyCoin


        

Ripple has requested to keep certain court sensitive documents sealed.



Ripple has argued that public disclosure of these documents could hurt their competitive edge.



Ripple has argued that sealing the documents protects confidentiality agreements and is standard practice.




In a recent development surrounding the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple has filed a motion to seal certain documents related to the remedies phase of the case. This move highlights the sensitivity of information potentially disclosed during litigation and the potential impact on the cryptocurrency industry.



Can Ripple Keep Business Secrets Hidden?



The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, alleging that the company’s sale of XRP, a digital asset used on its global payments network, constituted an unregistered securities offering. Both parties have submitted extensive legal arguments, and the case is currently in the remedies phase, which determines potential penalties or settlements.




Ripple’s motion to seal argues that certain remedy-related documents contain confidential information that could be detrimental if made public. This information includes proprietary business strategies, sensitive financial data, and internal company communications. 



Public disclosure of such details, Ripple contends, could provide a significant advantage to competitors in the cryptocurrency market and undermine Ripple’s future business endeavors. Beyond competitive concerns, the motion emphasizes the need to protect the privacy of individuals involved in the case. 



Releasing the documents, Ripple argues, could expose personal data of Ripple employees and third-party associates, potentially leading to privacy violations and harming their reputations and security. 



Protecting Privacy or Hiding Evidence?



The company underscores its commitment to protecting personal information and cites legal precedents where courts have granted similar motions to safeguard privacy and prevent undue competitive advantage.




Ripple further emphasizes that the documents in question are subject to confidentiality agreements with various parties. Sealing these documents, they argue, is crucial to uphold those agreements and maintain trust with business partners.



The court’s decision will likely be made public in the coming weeks. This decision could hold broader implications for the cryptocurrency industry, as it grapples with regulatory scrutiny and the need to balance transparency with protecting sensitive business information.



On the Flipside




The SEC might argue that complete transparency throughout the legal process is essential, especially in a case that sets a precedent for the cryptocurrency industry.



Lack of transparency could raise questions about the legitimacy of Ripple’s defense or the fairness of the eventual settlement.



There’s a need to balance Ripple’s concerns about protecting confidential information with the public’s right to know.




Why This Matters



The court’s decision on Ripple’s motion to seal documents sets a precedent for how much transparency companies must offer during legal battles involving cryptocurrencies. If the motion is granted, it could shield sensitive information but also raise concerns about fairness and information asymmetry within the industry.

Worldcoin Open Sources Security System to Keep User Data Safe - DailyCoin


        

Worldcoin Foundation launched and open-sourced a new SMPC system.



Open Source enhances security through transparency.



Worldcoin hopes to align with global security regulations. 




Worldcoin, a crypto project co-founded by Sam Altman of OpenAI, has been facing criticism over its practices around user data protection. As the firm handles sensitive biometric data of its users, security is key, and the company has already faced a security breach in the past.



In response to these criticisms, Worldcoin has taken steps towards better security. Most recently, the company has launched and open-sourced its secure multi-party computation (SMPC) system, aiming to boost the security of biometric data. 



Worldcoin Goes Open Source with Its Security System



On Wednesday, May 15, the Worldcoin Foundation launched its secure multi-party computation (SMPC) system, now available as open-source software on GitHub. This system is designed to bolster the security of biometric data, such as iris codes, by dividing secrets into multiple parts managed by different parties. 




This method ensures that no single entity can decrypt the entire secret, protecting it against unauthorized access. To further boost security, Worldcoin has deleted the old iris codes after migrating to the new SMPC system. 



Worldcoin collaborated with technologists from TACEO and Tools for Humanity to overcome the typical scale and cost constraints associated with SMPC systems. This new implementation makes SMPC viable for large-scale biometric data protection. 



Why Worldcoin Went Open Source



Open-source software plays a critical role in enhancing data security. By making the source code available to the public, developers and security experts around the world can examine, test, and improve the software. 




This transparency leads to quicker identification and resolution of vulnerabilities. In the context of biometric data, this level of scrutiny is essential to protect sensitive information from breaches and misuse.



This move comes after Worldcoin suffered a major breach in May 2023, which exposed critical iris codes used to verify users. In response, the company underwent a comprehensive audit, which claimed there were no further vulnerabilities. However, in the meantime, multiple governments worldwide have placed Worldcoin under investigation, and some have outright banned it. 



On the Flipside




While open source tends to be more secure in the long run, it is not foolproof. It is particularly vulnerable when hackers discover vulnerabilities in the code before the community members. 



In the past, hackers have discovered vulnerabilities in public blockchains and smart contracts, which are open-source by nature. 




Why This Matters



This move by Worldcoin highlights the security benefits of open-source software. This is especially important for projects that handle sensitive biometric data.

                        Tether Operations Limited, the largest entity in the digital asset ecosystem, announced a strategic partnership with Oobit, a mobile payment app, and the TON Foundation on May 16. The partnership comes after Tether launched USDT and XAUt on The Open Network (TON) in April.Tether and TON Foundation Partner with Oobit to Revolutionize Crypto Payments for MerchantsAccording to Thursday’s announcement, the partnership will enhance the user experience for transactions with its digital assets, USDT and Tether Gold (XAUt), on The Open Network (TON). By incorporating the Oobit mobile payment app, Tether will provide merchants with a more seamless and convenient way to handle cryptocurrency payments.Oobit’s Tap & Pay feature allows merchants to receive fiat currency even if the payment is in USDT. The integration is set to expand the practical use of cryptocurrencies, making them a widely accepted payment option.Earlier in February, Tether participated in Oobit’s Series A funding round, which raised $25 million. Oobit CEO Amram Adar highlighted the inclusive nature of the partnership.“We’re not just providing another payment option; we’re providing unbanked access to the most prominent cryptocurrencies and worldwide payments using Oobit,” Adar said.Peer-to-Peer Payments on Telegram with USDT Integration
The TON blockchain, integrated with Telegram, facilitates a simple, borderless experience for peer-to-peer payments. This, in turn, leads to a higher percentage of the population having access to decentralized services and an improved user experience.Since the integration, over $200 million worth of USDT has been issued on TON‘s blockchain, enabling users to send USDT via direct messages on Telegram and utilize it for instant crypto Tap payments on Oobit. USDT is also available on 14 other blockchains, including Tron and Ethereum, and joined the Celo network in March. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, expressed enthusiasm about the collaboration.“Together, we will provide banking solutions to the unbanked population and revolutionize how users transact with cryptocurrencies, making it easier and more convenient,” said Ardoino.Earlier this month, Tether officially announced additional investment into CityPay.io, a platform enabling users to make payments at various establishments, including Wendy’s and Radisson Hotels, using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It also plans to expand to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.

Fetch.AI Soars 14.5% As AI Tokens Surge, Can FET Reach $4?


																The crypto market is 5.1% up today, with a total market capitalization of $2.3 trillion. The recent pump has propelled different sectors, with memecoins being 9% up and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tokens increasing 11.2% in the last 24 hours.

	Related Reading



Fetch.AI (FET) is at the forefront of the AI sector with its remarkable 14.5% increase in the past day. Some analysts foresee a bullish breakout for the token soon.
Are AI Tokens Taking The Lead?
As reported by NewsBTC, many market experts consider Artificial intelligence tokens a contender for the cycle’s biggest narrative in round 2.
Alex Wacy said the artificial intelligence industry is “on the brink of a multi-trillion-dollar boom” due to the increasing interest over the last year. As a result, the analyst considers the sector could create a market valued in the trillions, reaching $2 trillion by 2030.
This week, AI tokens have performed strongly. Altcoin Sherpa pointed out that the sector is “looking decent overall,” with tokens like Arweave (AR), Ocean Protocol (OCEAN), and Fetch.ai performing the best.
Renowned traded Daan Crypto considers the AI sector to be “bouncing the strongest” on this new market move, while memecoins seem to be the “weakest.” The trader shared his thoughts on Fetch.AI’s recent performance.
Daan highlighted the token’s attempt to break above the diagonal trendline. Per the chart, FET is testing the diagonal resistance, with the $2.35 mark being the first resistance level to reclaim.

A breakout above this level could be a “good start to a further trend change.” Moreover, the token broke “above the 4H 200MA/EMA already.” Per the trader, FET would need to test the $2.5 mark and remain above the $2.35 price range to “break the trend and head higher over the next couple of weeks.”
Similarly, crypto trader Scient considers the token consolidating inside a one-day ascending bullish triangle. His chart highlights the $2.12 mark as support for the diagonal trendline.
He forecasted a deviation below the trendline “towards 1D 100EMA” before reclaiming the $2.12 price range and moving back inside the triangle. If a retest and confirmation of the trendline reclaim occurred, the trader suggested he “would long it.”
Analysts Forecast $4 For FET
Crypto analyst World of Charts identified a “textbook” bullish pennant pattern on FET’s chart. The analyst expects an upside breakout soon, potentially leading to a 2x bullish wave. If the breakout is successful, the token’s price could move above the $4 price range.


Moreover, CryptoBoss seems to concur with this forecast. The trader shared a similar chart, signaling a possible breakout that could drive the token to double its price. In the post, he stated, “$FET 4$ exe loading…”

In the past 24 hours, the token has surged an impressive 14.5%, going from $2.04 to hover between the $2.3-$2.32 price range. This increase represents 7.5% and 13.2% in the weekly and monthly timeframes.
Similarly, FET has seen a rise in market activity. Its daily trading volume increased by 102%, with $354.2 million traded on the last day.

Ethereum Team Lead Sounds The Alarm: Are Developers Prioritizing Short-term Fixes?


								Ethereum is a legacy network, but it has been rapidly evolving. It has adapted to environmental needs, for example, while looking for ways to scale. Several hard choices have been made, including shifting from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system. 
However, Péter Szilágyi, a developer and team lead at Ethereum, is concerned about how “malleable” Ethereum is becoming.
Ethereum Prioritizing Short-Term Fixes Over Protocol Integrity?
Taking to X, Szilágyi criticized the project’s development direction. The team lead noted an increasing trend of developers prioritizing short-term fixes over the protocol’s long-term health.  
This criticism comes at a time when regulators have been scrutinizing Ethereum, and even the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly considers ETH as an unregistered security. It is the decision that has been made around this that Szilágyi is worried about.

The developer is concerned that the constant tinkering with core protocol rules to appease regulators is a recipe for disaster. This “co-opting tiny decisions here and there,” the team lead said, risks morphing Ethereum into a traditional finance (TradFi) clone. 
When this happens, the core tenets of decentralization and the technically elusive “censorship resistance” feature in TradFi, will be sacrificed. 
Szilágyi thinks Ethereum is on a losing path, especially regarding the Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) issue. In Ethereum, validators, tasked with approving transactions in no particular order but depending on the attached gas fee, can “capture” value by changing the transaction order within a block. 
Danger Of Centralization: MEV Issues Not Addressed, Suspicion On Liquid Staking
The developer said MEV’s negative effects have not been addressed yet. However, instead of dedicating time and effort to fix it, the focus has shifted towards “catering the protocol and infra around it to proprietary MEV builders.” Adopting this path, Szilágyi argues that Ethereum developers are essentially handing to a centralized lot, watering the decentralization in the second most valuable network. 
Beyond MEV, the developer also thinks the rise of liquid staking solutions like Lido Finance will destabilize the network. 
ETH holders can earn rewards through liquid staking platforms without running a validator node. Over time, the  Szilágyi worries that only a few operators will wield strong network control, increasing concentration. 

Whether developers will heed Szilágyi’s concerns remains to be seen. However, what’s clear is that developers have been introducing implementations on the mainnet to enhance user experience and reduce costs.

In the latest upgrade, Dencun, developers made trading on layer-2 protocols like Base and Arbitrum cheaper. As seen from the Ethereum roadmap, there will also be more efforts to scale the mainnet via Sharding in the coming years.

Pump.fun Attacker Says He Wanted to 'Kill' Solana Meme Coin Launcher - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsPump.fun, the popular tool for launching meme coins on Solana, suffered an exploit on Thursday that left the protocol compromised, and prompted its leadership to temporarily shut the site down. All the while, the apparent attacker behind the stunt gloated about it online. The attack appeared to target accounts, called bonding curve contracts, that move the liquidity of tokens of a sufficient size created on Pump.fun, onto the Solana decentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium. Some on-chain sleuths deduced that with the aid of a private key—one only an employee of Pump.fun would have access to—the attacker diverted funds earmarked for Raydium to unrelated wallet addresses. Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at crypto market maker Wintermute, estimated that the attacker siloed off at least $2 million worth of SOL using this exploit. In a twist, however, the attacker immediately began airdropping the stolen funds to random wallet addresses. He appears to have selected holders of a handful of Solana tokens and NFTs as the non-consenting recipients of the Pump.fun loot. Within minutes of the attack, a Twitter account belonging to a former Pump.fun employee claimed responsibility for it. The user began posting extensively and somewhat erratically, writing that he was not afraid of imprisonment and was aware his identity was doxxed. “Everybody be cool, this is robbery,” the account wrote. “I'm about to change the course of history. [And] then rot in jail. Am I sane? Nah. Am I well? [Very] much not. Do I want for anything? My mom raised from the dead.”The account then began retweeting posts from thankful crypto users claiming to have received portions of the stolen funds from the attacker’s airdrops.Decrypt reached out to the self-proclaimed attacker for more information about the exploit and his potential motivations for committing it. “The threads are there, dig deeper,” was his only response. A few hours after the attack, Pump.fun announced that it had paused trading on the protocol, and was investigating the issue. The company said it intended to cooperate with law enforcement; the self-proclaimed attacker is Canadian.  On a Twitter Spaces on Thursday afternoon, the self-proclaimed Pump.fun attacker said he had worked for Pump.fun for a few weeks, that he felt the company was “horribly managed,” and that he had “personal grievances” against the company’s leadership. Asked why he committed the theft, he was extraordinarily blunt.“I just kind of wanted to kill Pump.fun because it’s something to do,” he said. “It’s inadvertently hurt people for a long time.”Decrypt reached out to Pump.fun to verify whether the self-proclaimed attacker did in fact previously work for the company, but did not immediately receive a response.While Pump.fun has seen huge amounts of trading volume in the last few months as meme coin frenzy has overtaken crypto, it has also attracted criticism for fanning the flames of crypto’s more gambling-focused, purely speculative underbelly. The self-proclaimed Pump.fun attacker said on Thursday—without providing any supporting details—that he observed the company to be on a downward path that he helped accelerate. “They were going to kill themselves eventually, the way things were going,” he said.One Spaces attendee asked the man whether he expected he would be sent to prison for his actions. “I’m pretty sure there’s a fairly high chance of that,” he replied.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Solana restaking protocol Solayer soft-launches deposits - Blockworks


Solayer, a startup building a product akin to EigenLayer on Solana, opened restaking deposits Thursday afternoon.
The invite-only deposit period was capped at $20 million dollars. Users could natively restake SOL on Solayer, or deposit the liquid staking products mSOL, bSOL, JITOSOL, and INF. With the private access launch, Solayer becomes a horse in the race to build a restaking ecosystem on the Solana blockchain. 
Few Solana restaking protocols have gone live, with the exception of Picasso, which runs its own version of Solana restaking.

Perhaps in a testament to the hype surrounding these protocols launching, Solayer hit its $20 million cap within 45 minutes of opening withdrawals, a member of the Solayer core team confirmed to Blockworks. And it’s not just degens placing bets on the new restaking protocol. Solayer is looking to raise $8 million at an $80 million valuation led by Polychain, CoinDesk reported. 
Still, little is known about the company. Solayer said the protocol has “been in the works since [the] end of 2023” in a blog post. It called the first deposit period “epoch 0,” and restaked assets will be locked in the protocol until “epoch 3.” A roadmap Solayer posted Wednesday said that a liquid restaking token called sSOL would launch in epoch 6. 
A Solayer team member did not say how long each epoch would last but confirmed sSOL being an LRT. 
Read more: The risks of restaking are extremely overrated
Restaking refers to using the staked tokens securing proof-of-stake blockchains to secure another layer of applications — or essentially staking staked tokens a second time. This extends the security of the blockchain’s base layer and puts idle staked assets to use, creating additional yield opportunities. By distributing security responsibilities across multiple layers, restaking enhances network resilience and maximizes the utility of staked tokens.
Solana is secured by a combination of proof-of-stake and proof-of-history, meaning restaking could be applied to the network.
The concept was pioneered on Ethereum by EigenLayer, which has raised over $150 million in venture funding and secured over $14 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama.

And now, the concept has made its way to Solana.
“In the coming year, we are excited about and hope to lead the movement of ‘scaling out’ of the Solana base chain,” Solayer wrote in a blog post.

937 Institutional Investors Reported Holding Bitcoin ETFs - "10 Times as Many as Gold ETFs" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Experiencing phenomenal growth, BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF garnered more than 400 asset ownership notifications in its first 13F season, which Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described as a “mind-blowing” and record-breaking achievement.
Balchunas expressed his surprise in his post on


Over the past month and a half, 13F filings for financial institutions have been gradually released. These filings, which report Bitcoin Spot ETF holdings as of the end of the first quarter of 2024, provide valuable information about which entities are purchasing spot Bitcoin ETF shares and the scope of each purchase.
Total filings reveal that 937 professional firms had investments in ETFs as of March 31. That's ten times the number invested in gold ETFs, according to an analysis by Bitwise.






According to analysis by K33 Research, professional investors held 18.7% of total managed assets in BTC ETFs with $11.06 billion at the end of the first quarter.
Teddy Fusaro, President of Bitwise Asset Management, stated that the market reflects a virtuous cycle in which allocations from other institutions increase as they see real, large and established institutional investors begin to invest in Bitcoin. Fusaro also addressed the skepticism of market commentators who theorized that inflows exceeding $53 billion were due entirely to individual interest. According to Fusaro, the first 13F reporting season disproved this theory.

                        In response to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ‘s increasing regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry, a small group of community members launched a decentralized anti-SEC memecoin called NotWifGary (NWG) on May 16.The memecoin project will take an anti-SEC and pro-Ethereum stance, rallying support for open-source developers and the broader Ethereum ecosystem.Heightened Regulatory Scrutiny Birthed The Anti-SEC Memecoin
The creation of NWG comes amid heightened regulatory focus on crypto by figures such as SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The anti-SEC memecoin is part of a movement to counter what its creators see as unjust regulatory pressure.Marco Monaco, a member of the NWG initiative, clarified that, despite his involvement with the zkEVM ecosystem Linea, the project is entirely separate from Linea and Consensys.“My involvement in this project is 100% at a personal level, and I’m not doing this in my official @LineaBuild role,” Monaco said. “This project is not tied at all to Linea or @Consensys, even if $NWG will stand with similar companies and support them during their journey against the SEC.”The official NWG account posted on X (formerly Twitter) that the project will “stand against Gary Gensler and the SEC, who are unlawfully threatening digital property by attacking Ethereum and open-source developers.”NWG will be categorized explicitly as a CultureCoin. It will be launched in a highly decentralized manner with a fair launch strategy. The 12 original project supporters, who are all publicly known, plan to deploy 100% of the token allocation in a liquidity pool.According to the project’s website, NWG will be launched on Linea as an ERC20 token, managed through a multi-sig wallet involving the original project supporters. The liquidity pool for NWG will be bootstrapped through community donations to ensure sufficient decentralization and fairness. Importantly, donations will not entitle contributors to NWG tokens but will earn them the “$NWG Launch Team” Soulbound Token (SBT).SEC Already Cracking Down Themselves
Democratic Representative Wiley Nickel recently commented that the SEC’s actions are turning crypto into a “political football,” unnecessarily forcing President Biden to “choose sides” on the matter. Nickel’s comments came after the proposed Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 rule, requiring SEC-reporting entities to record custodial crypto as liabilities on their balance sheets.According to government records, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, known for her critical stance on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, may lose her position on June 5. Crenshaw, sworn in alongside Commissioner Hester M. Peirce in August 2020, has not been re-nominated, and recent White House statements suggest no immediate plans to fill her position.This news comes amid rumors of SEC chairman Gary Gensler potentially resigning, although Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terret believes this is unlikely during an election year.Also, concerning the strict SEC stance on crypto, Kraken recently urged the US court to dismiss the SEC’s claims that it operated an unregistered securities trading platform, arguing that such claims could significantly reorder the US financial regulatory structure.Kraken believes that the SEC’s broad interpretation of its jurisdiction, mainly through the Howey test, would unnecessarily expand its authority beyond its intended limits, a matter that should be debated in Congress.

Bitwise CIO says BTC ETFs are huge success and 13F filings make him ‘incredibly bullish’

This week’s 13F filing revealed who is buying the spot Bitcoin ETFs and what their position size is, and while Bitwise Chief Investment Office Matt Hougan celebrated the success of the ETFs, he says there is a significant point that the media might miss that makes him even more bullish on the BTC ETFs. Hougan said that 563 professional investment firms have reported owning a combined $3.5 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs. Hougan anticipates that these numbers could eventually surpass 700 firms with total assets under management nearing $5 billion.Hougan’s guess was spot on, with the latest data from K33 Research revealing that more than 900 firms disclosed their spot Bitcoin ETF holdings.In a May 16 post on X, Senior analyst at K33 Research Ventle Lunde shared the following chart saying,“According to 13F reporting, 937 professional firms were invested in U.S. spot ETFs as of March 31. In comparison, gold ETFs had 95 professional firms invested in their first quarter (Bitwise).”Unique owners of Bitcoin ETFs Q1. Source: K33 ResearchBloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas observed that the biggest ETFs have attracted the largest portion of institutional capital, with BlackRock’s IBIT attracting more than 400 holders.Source: Eric BalchunasWhile terming this a “huge success,” Hougan said,“This is absolutely massive. For any financial advisor, family office, or institution wondering if they were the only one considering Bitcoin exposure, the answer is clear: You are not alone.”However, the executive noted that with more than $50 billion in assets under management (AUM), professional investors own just 7-10% of the total investment, and K33 Research data reveals this share to be 18%.Lunde’s X post explained,“Retail owns a majority of the float. Professional investors held exposure of $11.06bn by the end of Q1, representing 18.7% of the BTC ETF AUM.”Spot Bitcoin ETF AUM by cohort. Source: K33 ResearchHowever, Hougan argued that media portrayal of the spot Bitcoin ETFs being "retail-driven" funds might overlook a critical emerging trend that leaves him “incredibly bullish” from the initial 13F filings.The Bitwise CIO laid out a typical four-step investment trajectory observed among institutions, starting with a period of due diligence lasting 6-12 months of investment evaluation. The second step involves professionals making a small personal allocation before “exposing their investors to the market.” Eventually, this leads to more substantial platform-wide allocations across the entire client book, typically ranging from 1-5% of the portfolio, about six months after the initial allocation.“This tells me that the allocations we see in recent 13F filings are just a down payment,” Hougan wrote.Using Hightower Advisors as an example, Hougan explained that its current spot Bitcoin ETF allocation amounts to just 0.05% of its assets. However, if they were to follow the typical four-step investment process, a 1% allocation in time would equate to $1.2 billion from a single firm.“Multiply that by the growing number of professional investors participating in the space, and you can begin to see what’s behind my enthusiasm.”This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

XRP Whales Banking On Massive Bull Run With Billions Accumulated Despite Ripple vs SEC Showdown ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
In the ever-shifting waters of the cryptocurrency market, Ripple’s XRP whales have recently made a big move, accumulating a remarkable 110 million XRP valued at around $55 million. This surge in buying activity comes at a critical juncture for Ripple as the company navigates a challenging legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 



Despite the regulatory headwinds, this significant accumulation by large investors is a beacon of confidence in the embattled digital asset.



XRP Whales Big Bet



According to a chart shared by popular crypto analyst Ali Charts on X, Ripple’s largest investors, the whales, have been diving deep over the last two weeks and accumulated a massive haul of 110 million XRP tokens worth $55 million. This move, amid Ripple’s legal tussle with the SEC, not only defies the regulatory storm but also sends a clear message of unwavering confidence in XRP.







As a result of this buying spree, the total holdings of these whale addresses increased to 3.72 billion XRP, accounting for 6.7% of XRP’s circulating supply. Despite a slight decrease to 3.69 billion XRP by the time of reporting, this still marks a significant rise from the 3.61 billion held as of April 29.



Furthermore, data suggests that addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP have significantly boosted their holdings. On April 5, these addresses collectively held 6.16 billion XRP. This figure has surged to 6.59 billion XRP in just five weeks, marking an increase of 430 million XRP. Combined with other major addresses, the total accumulation reaches an impressive 540 million XRP over this period.

&nbsp



The impact of this whale activity is already rippling through the market, with XRP’s price edging by over 1.8% in the past 24 hours. This uptick, now trading at $0.5144, indicates a bullish sentiment among investors, eyeing a potential breakout as XRP establishes a resistance level at $0.5114 and a support level at $0.4974.



Whale activity often serves as a barometer for future price trends. The accumulation of XRP by these influential investors could signify a shift in market sentiment, potentially attracting more capital and bolstering XRP’s liquidity and stability. This could further cement XRP’s position as a major player in the digital asset space.



A Legal Storm on the Horizon: SEC vs. Ripple



However, Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC overshadows these optimistic developments. Ripple’s recent move to seal key details regarding discounts offered on XRP to institutional buyers has added another layer of intrigue to the case.



The outcome of this legal showdown could have far-reaching implications for regulating digital assets, making it a focal point for investors and market observers alike. Ripple and its investors are bracing for the impact as the legal drama unfolds. The resolution of the SEC lawsuit could shape the future regulatory landscape for digital assets, making it a pivotal moment for Ripple.

Why Memecoins, Despite Being Unserious By Nature, Seriously Exemplify Web3’s Core Value Proposition - The Defiant

Memecoins are a prime example of how any collective group of individuals can create the economic infrastructure to facilitate commerce, trade, and collaboration without the need for an intermediary.If you’ve even marginally kept up with the madness that is the world of digital assets and web3, you’ve most likely stumbled upon a highly publicized rags-to-riches story. They more or less take the same format: an individual making a life-changing amount of money by investing in a token built around a viral internet cartoon sensation or more eloquently named, meme. If you haven’t come across one of these stories yet, rest assured that you read the previous sentence correctly. There are numerous accounts of people buying these assets, often referred to as ‘memecoins’, and experiencing 2x, 5x, or even 50-100x returns in a matter of days.Most famously, Elon Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin, an ancient memecoin by crypto’s standards, rose from the ashes to prominence in late 2021. This happened when Musk, who was at the time the world’s richest person, publicly endorsed the asset in a series of tweets. Lo and behold, Dogecoin and its associated meme broke the internet. While the vast majority of people who fall into this type of wealth do so unintentionally or through careful investing, there’s something to be said about the power of the individual and the communities they belong to. That’s something that has been showcased to the highest degree again and again in this industry.Sophisticated finance ‘experts’ and ‘gurus’ are, rightfully so, quick to question the underlying intrinsic value of these tokens. Typically, this skepticism questions their value from a technological perspective, which is normally a good place to start. Low barriers to entry, undefined regulatory frameworks, and easy-to-use infrastructure make creating one of these tokens pretty easy. Investors have been burned in the past, so they are wary of scams and rug pulls. However, on the contrary, I assert that to fully understand the value proposition of the memecoin asset class, one must truly understand the principles of money and how society assigns value to anything.“But they’re just cartoons! They have no value nor do they serve a purpose”Before I go any further, it’s important for me to reiterate that anyone thinking about investing in digital assets should do so only after they’ve conducted an adequate amount of due diligence and research. Most people think that this starts and ends with the actual investment in question but I’d go as far as to say that in today’s day and age, it’s imperative that all investors sufficiently understand money and the modern financial system.I say this for two key reasons. Firstly, to fully understand Bitcoin (or any crypto’s value proposition), an individual must understand the core benefits of decentralization. To do that, one must understand the pitfalls of our current monetary system. In the U.S., we’re dealing with hyperinflation and a currency that’s continuously being printed into irrelevance to keep up with America’s hefty promises. Ultimately, this makes the dollar valueless which is a huge issue, as it’s something that’s pervasively used as a store of value.The second reason people need to understand the current system is that an overwhelming amount of the criticism memecoins and crypto face is also applicable to many of the fiat monetary systems that exist today. Since the debasement from the gold standard in 1971, the US dollar has been backed solely by the republic’s belief in the government saying the dollar is worth what they claim it to be. Sure the U.S. has the world’s most powerful armed forces and American pride has helped the country ascend to the global superpower it is today, but hyperinflation and growing political tensions have started to weigh on the long-term sustainability of America’s growth.It only takes a couple more cracks in the U.S.’ seemingly impenetrable armor before we as people start to beg the same question of what truly gives the dollar its value. If anything, one could argue that the U.S. dollar is the world’s largest memecoin, built on the back of the imagery of the nation’s founding fathers and their foundational principles.Power to the people!Following the SEC’s approval of the highly-anticipated Bitcoin Spot ETF, we’ve seen unprecedented inflows into digital assets. Demand has continued to outpace the natural supply of the network. On the back of higher valuations, we’ve seen various ecosystems benefit as investors rotate profits into thriving utility-led ecosystems and ultimately, memecoin projects.Most notably, we’ve seen a proliferation of memecoins in both the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems. Shiba Inu and Pepe are highly respected, mature memecoins in the more battle-tested Ethereum ecosystem, while numerous Solana memecoins have risen to prominence over the past few weeks. Two reasons for this are Solana’s vibrant retail community and the network’s low transaction costs. Bonk got the party started but we’ve seen numerous others like Dogwifhat, Myro, and many others. Dogwifhat’s community surprisingly came together and raised over $600,000 for ad space on the Las Vegas Sphere — proof that what may have started as an inside joke is now going commercial in 2024!Why Memecoins Are Integral to Web3 AdoptionMemecoins, if nothing else, are easy for crypto newbies to understand. This is potentially the most important aspect of them. The narrative behind several memecoin projects lies in the power of the community behind said meme.Memecoins are a prime example of how any collective group of individuals can create the economic infrastructure to facilitate commerce, trade, and collaboration without the need for an intermediary. Before blockchain, this was virtually impossible.To create the world we inhabit today, it was necessary for nation-states to establish a formal government whose sole purpose was to uphold the integrity of such a regime. As we’ve seen over time, this system requires infallible trust, given people’s financial livelihoods are at the mercy of said government. Moreover, given that many governments around the world operate with limited transparency, growing tensions around the globe have started to impact people’s trust which undeniably stresses any financial regime.Memecoins are completely at odds with this antiquated set-up.. Rather, memecoins and web3 technologies in general, enable users to interact with both people and money without having to trust any person or entity.Failing to understand the value in that, is failing to understand crypto and decentralization altogether.

US Treasury Department Issues Statement on Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin Sistemi


The US Treasury Department has expressed its intention to enhance anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures regarding digital assets.
The Ministry published the 2024 “National Strategy to Combat Terrorism and Other Illegal Financing” strategy today. The document outlines its priorities in combating illicit financing and notes its ongoing work on cryptocurrencies. These efforts include sanctions against some exchanges and groups such as Bitzlato and Lazarus, and the agreement with Binance.


The strategy document identified four key priorities: closing gaps in anti-money laundering regulations, supporting a more effective and risk-focused framework, improving the effectiveness of law enforcement and leveraging technological innovations.
The document suggests that updating existing regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies would support these priorities. This could include working on global implementation of Financial Action Task Force standards, as well as potential updates to the U.S. regulatory framework to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.






The document says:

“Successful application of the existing Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism oversight and enforcement framework to virtual asset activities requires the United States to allocate adequate oversight and enforcement resources and provide analysts with greater expertise on new technologies, including the analysis of publicly available blockchain data.” “This requires continuing to invest in technology and training for inspectors and regulators.”

During the press conference, a Treasury official revealed that Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo and Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Undersecretary Brian Nelson discussed with lawmakers the department's request for greater authority and oversight regarding certain crypto issues.

Ripple's Top Lawyer Celebrates SEC's Latest Setback


Stuart Alderoty, Ripple's chief legal officer, has celebrated a recent bipartisan vote in the US Senate to kill an anti-crypto SEC rule that could pose a major threat to regulatory custodial services in the US. Alderoty claims that the "unauthorized overreach" of Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will not be tolerated by both parties. As reported by U.Today, some of the most influential cryptocurrency luminaries, including MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, have praised the Senate for voting to nullify the SEC's controversial SAB 121 guidance. The rule was supposed to force regulated banking institutions to register the cryptocurrency holdings of their customers on their balance sheets. The industry took issue with this rule since it would make it very challenging for banks to offer custodial services. Some critics also noted that it could potentially negatively impact the rights of cryptocurrency owners. The SEC's cryptocurrency-friendly commissioner Hester Peirce also slammed the agency's approach to regulation custodial services for digital assets as "scattershot." The cryptocurrency industry and banks united in their efforts to repeal the SEC's SAB 121 rule. The banks are against it since it would negatively affect their balance sheets due to crypto's inherent volatility. Gensler, however, has defended the rule, pointing to the fact that the previous 120 SABs were not called into question. Alderoty, who keeps a close eye on the latest developments on Capitol Hill, has repeatedly stressed the significance of bipartisan cooperation when it comes to cryptocurrency-related bills. He has also taken note of recent efforts by US lawmakers to pass a much-anticipated stablecoin bill. Ripple is gearing up to launch its own stablecoin, which has already appeared in the SEC's crosshairs.

Pump.fun Hit for $2M in Flash Loan Exploit | Bankless


Pump.fun, a buzzy Solana memecoin launcher with huge levels of activity levels recently, paused operations after suffering a flash loan attack that resulted in an estimated loss of 12.3k SOL (~$2M).  What’s the scoop?Former Pump.fun employee staccoverflow has claimed responsibility for the attack, citing personal anguish and contempt for his previous bosses. The exploit involved a private key compromise and flash loans of SOL borrows via marginfi to manipulate Pump.fun’s memecoin bonding curves, followed by withdrawing liquidity meant for Raydium pools. While loss estimates ranged from ~$300k to ~$80M amid the initial chaos, Wintermute’s head researcher Igor Igamberdiev has now pegged the total loss as at least $2M. Bankless take:Pump.fun is currently the memecoin capital of Solana, and lately it’s seemed unstoppable. That said, this attack, while far from devastating, certainly takes some wind out of the platform’s sails. However, it seems likely the token launcher can rebound fast.Across the two days preceding the exploit, Pump.fun generated $1.9M worth of revenues or 95% of the total losses of the attack. It’s not a desirable situation to be in, but the team has the resources to make its users whole. All in all, the episode is a reminder of the potential risks around the crypto frontier and the importance of private key security. The Pump.fun team dropped the ball in a big way here, so watch for how they respond in the days ahead.

Sei Token Pops on V2 Roadmap - The Defiant

The Layer 1 blockchain’s token spiked 30% after the team revealed deployment plans for its Ethereum-compatible V2 upgrade. Sei, a high-speed Layer 1 blockchain, shared its V2 roadmap yesterday, sending its native token soaring.Sei V2 will bring the first highly performant parallelized EVM into production, kicking off its first phase with a governance proposal. If approved, phase 2 means deploying V2 Alpha, bringing to life EVM-based smart contracts, and beginning infrastructure integrations with the network.According to the team, phase two is expected to take days rather than weeks while it remains focused on maintaining chain stability.Phase 3 lacks specific details, but the team said it will announce them when V2 is stable and critical infrastructure such as RPCs, bridges, indexers, and multisigs are ready.SEI soared on the news, jumping 25% from $0.44 to $0.58. It has since dropped slightly, changing hands currently for $0.55. The network’s market capitalization sits at $1.6 billion.SEI PriceIn early February, Sei upgraded its devnet, allowing developers to deploy code compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).Upgrading the network to EVM compatibility meant opening its doors to Ethereum’s vast ecosystem of dApps, furthering its move to provide its developer community with more tools and a broader programming language.The release wasn’t intended for end users but rather for developers to experiment with deploying their applications.

Bitcoin Bull is Back: Why BTC’s 7% Jump Is Just the Beginning - DailyCoin


        

The price of Bitcoin has surged 7%, fueled by institutional investment and positive economic data.



Hedge funds have been piling into Bitcoin ETFs, with record inflows for leading funds like Fidelity’s FBTC.



Bitcoin has neared its all-time high, raising hopes of a bull run for the cryptocurrency market.




The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a surge in optimism, fueled by a confluence of factors. Bitcoin, the leading digital asset, saw its price climb into bullish territory on May 15, fueled by a significant increase in institutional investment and positive economic data.



Hedge Funds Join the Bitcoin Rush



On May 15, institutional investors piled into Bitcoin ETFs, pushing inflows to a two-week high of $303 million. This renewed confidence is a major signal for the market, reflecting a shift in sentiment and a potential long-term bullish trend for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.







Fidelity’s FBTC fund led the charge, attracting a record-breaking $131 million, the highest since March. Other major players, like Bitwise’s BITB fund and even Grayscale’s GBTC, which had previously seen outflows, witnessed a reversal in investor sentiment.




This renewed institutional interest extends beyond traditional investment firms. Hedge fund giant Millennium Management surprised the market by revealing a staggering $2 Billion Bitcoin ETF portfolio, making them the largest holder of specific Bitcoin ETFs. 



This move, alongside disclosures from other notable hedge funds like Elliott Capital and Apollo Management Holdings, further solidifies the growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin. Coinciding with the surge in ETF inflows was a significant jump in Bitcoin’s price. 



Bitcoin Price Surges 7%, Nearing ATH



On May 15, the cryptocurrency surged by 7%, reaching a high of $66,567 during early Asian trading. This brings Bitcoin within 10% of the all-time high of $73,750, set in March. Another factor contributing to the positive market sentiment is the release of key US inflation data on May 15. The data came in as expected, easing investor concerns about rising inflation. 




Inflation is a major factor influencing Federal Reserve decisions on interest rates. Lower interest rates favor riskier assets like Bitcoin, making higher-yielding alternatives more attractive.



With renewed institutional backing, a positive inflation outlook, and a price nearing its all-time high, Bitcoin appears bullish. However, the cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and investors must conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.



On the Flipside




While institutional investment is a positive sign, it can also increase volatility. Large investors entering or exiting the market can cause significant short-term price fluctuations.



Future inflation reports might exceed expectations, prompting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and negatively impacting Bitcoin.




Why This Matters



This confluence of surging institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs, a significant price jump, and positive economic data suggest a maturing cryptocurrency market with increased mainstream acceptance. This could lead to a sustained bull run for Bitcoin and potentially the broader crypto market.

Crypto Influencer Advice Does Not Pay, Report Finds - DailyCoin


        

Study reveals crypto influencer tweets often lead to short-term gains.



However, these are followed by long-term losses.



The research analyzed 36,000 tweets by 180 influencers. 




The crypto market has attracted many retail investors, who often turn to social media influencers for advice. These crypto influencers claim to provide valuable investment insights to their large followings on platforms like Twitter. 



However, recent research suggests that their advice might not be as valuable as it may seem to some. A recent study shows that this advice, while creating short-term boosts in the price of the tokens, is often followed by significant long-term losses. 



Study Reveals Risks of Following Crypto Influencers’ Advice



On April 19, 2023, researchers Kenneth J. Merkley, Joseph Pacelli, Mark Piorkowski, and Brian Williams published a study examining crypto-influencers’ effects on Twitter. The study analyzed 36,000 tweets from 180 influencers over two years, ending in December 2022, to determine whether the advice was beneficial. 




They found that tweets from crypto-influencers generally led to short-term positive returns. Specifically, the average return one day after a tweet was 1.83%, and it was 1.57% two days after. For smaller tokens, the one-day return was even higher, at 3.86%. However, these initial gains were often followed by significant long-term losses, with cumulative returns dropping to -2.24% over ten days and -6.53% over 30 days.



Tweets from self-proclaimed crypto experts and influencers with large followings had the most pronounced effects. These influencers often present themselves as authorities in the crypto space, but the study’s findings suggest their advice might lead to more harm than good in the long run. The study also highlighted that tweets with positive sentiment or ‘buy’ recommendations had stronger short-term impacts but also led to more significant long-term losses. 



How Influencers Impact the Crypto Space



The recent findings are consistent with some of the experiences in the past. Numerous celebrities have been accused of undisclosed promotions and pump-and-dump schemes of various cryptocurrencies. This naturally leads to a price increase in the short term but hurts long-term performance.  




High-profile examples include YouTube star Logan Paul and his CryptoZoo project. Announced in September 2022, CryptoZoo attracted NFT enthusiasts who invested $2.5 million in animal-themed NFTs. However, the project faced delays and accusations of being a “rug pull” when it failed to deliver, leading to substantial losses for investors.



Similarly, celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather Jr. have faced legal scrutiny for their undisclosed promotions. In 2021, the SEC charged both for promoting the EthereumMax (EMAX) token, which quickly plummeted in value. 



On the Flipside




Controversies around influencer promotions are leading to heightened regulatory scrutiny. For instance, in June 2023, the European Commission received a complaint targeted at crypto promotions on social media. 



New European Markets Crypto-Assets (MiCA) rules could also expose crypto influencers to charges of market manipulation. 




Why This Matters



The study’s findings underscore the need for due diligence and skepticism when considering investment advice from social media. Following influencer recommendations without thorough research can lead to significant financial losses, as evidenced by the short-term gains and long-term declines observed in the study.

Gone in 12 Seconds: Two MIT-Educated Brothers Arrested for Alleged Lightning-Fast $25,000,000 Crypto Exploit - The Daily Hodl


								Two US brothers who attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have been arrested for allegedly partaking in a high-speed multimillion-dollar crypto heist.
According to a new press release by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the brothers – Anton Peraire-Bueno, 24, of Boston, and James Pepaire-Bueno, 28, of New York – have been attained with three charges related to the alleged theft of $25 million from the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain in just 12 seconds.










The DOJ says that the brothers used their expertise in mathematics and computer science to create a first-of-its-kind exploit that manipulated the way Ethereum validated transactions, allowing them to steal crypto assets that were pending in private transactions.
The brothers are accused of using the exploit for months and then concealing their identities as well as obfuscating the digital assets they allegedly stole.
As stated by Special Agent in Charge Thomas Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) New York Field Office, in the press release,
“These brothers allegedly committed a first-of-its-kind manipulation of the Ethereum blockchain by fraudulently gaining access to pending transactions, altering the movement of the electronic currency, and ultimately stealing $25 million in cryptocurrency from their victims. 
In this case, IRS-CI New York’s Cyber Unit simply followed the money. Regardless of the complexity of the case, we continue to lead the effort in financial criminal investigations with cutting-edge technology and good-ole-fashioned investigative work, on and off the blockchain.”
The brothers have been charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering and face a maximum penalty of two decades behind bars if convicted.

ICP Price Drops 10% As DFINITY Foundation Unveils Updated Internet Computer Roadmap


																The DEFINITY Foundation, the company behind developing the Internet Computer protocol, has recently unveiled an updated roadmap to facilitate increased artificial intelligence (AI) blockchain adoption. 
As the native token of the network, ICP continues to lead among AI tokens and holds the 22nd position in the top 100 cryptocurrencies. However, recent price drops have prompted the Foundation to focus on key areas of development to revitalize the token’s price action and further advance the protocol’s capabilities.
Internet Computer Roadmap
The highlighted aspects of the roadmap outline two critical steps called “milestones” in the Internet Compute platform domain: Tokamak and Stellarator. Tokamak focuses on reducing latency by maximizing the block rate of each subnet and introducing a new synchronous ingress submission endpoint. 

	Related Reading



Stellarator, on the other hand, will reportedly increase the storage layer, enabling subnet blockchains to host over 1TB of canister smart contract storage while improving the efficiency of the consensus layer.
The DEFINITY Foundation aims to integrate AI capabilities as smart contracts on the Internet Computer protocol to address the resource-intensive nature of AI training and inference. 
The Cyclotron milestone outlined in the roadmap will increase on-chain inference for larger AI models through performance improvements in the WebAssembly runtime and inference engine. The Gyrotron milestone, on the other hand, explores the integration of AI-specialized subnets with GPU support, enabling compute—and memory-intensive computations on-chain.
ICP’s Interoperability With Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana
ICP’s Chain Fusion technology will allow direct interoperability with major blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs). Nonetheless, the roadmap introduces several milestones to expand interoperability. 
Tritium milestone enables ICP to interact with Ethereum and EVM smart contracts, facilitating cross-chain communication. Deuterium milestone extends Chain Fusion support to emerging Bitcoin protocols. 
Interestingly, the Helium milestone aims to increase Chain Fusion for the Solana network, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) leveraging the capabilities of both networks.


	Related Reading



Next, the Solenoid milestone decentralizes the operation of the ICP boundary nodes, “empowering” the network’s participants. The Levitron milestone provides visibility into the Internet Computer’s edge infrastructure, allowing developers to gain insights into dApp usage patterns and generate user statistics.
Lastly, ICP will incorporate two governance systems: the NNS (Internet Computer’s DAO) and the SNS framework governing individual dApps. Tokenomics incentivizes voting participation and aligns DAO decisions with long-term interests. These governance mechanisms will allegedly ensure decentralized decision-making and community involvement.

As of the current press time, the price of ICP has experienced a significant increase of 120% year-to-date. However, it is currently trading at $12.05, 98% lower than its previous all-time high (ATH) of $700 achieved in September 2023. 
Once implemented, the impact of the roadmap on the cryptocurrency’s price and its potential to regain bullish momentum and drive adoption for various use cases remain to be seen.

Canada's Self-Proclaimed 'Crypto King' Faces Fraud And Money Laundering Charges - Details


								Aiden Pleterski, known in the crypto community as the “Crypto King,” and his associate Colin Murphy have been formally charged with serious financial offenses.
These charges emerged from an extensive joint investigation, Project Swan, conducted by the Durham Regional Police Service (DRPS) and the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC).
The investigation focused on allegations of fraud and money laundering centered in Ontario, particularly in Whitby and Oshawa, the respective residences of Pleterski and Murphy.

Investigation Details And Public Advisory
The authorities have levied multiple charges against Pleterski, including a fraud charge for over $5,000, laundering the proceeds of crime, and breaching a court order from May 14, 2024.
Given the gravity of these charges, Pleterski is currently detained and awaiting a decision on his bail. In contrast, Colin Murphy, also charged with fraud of over $5,000, was released under conditions that mandated his future court appearance.
The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and the Durham Regional Police Service (DRPS), in collaboration with the Toronto Police Service, York Regional Police, and the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), have jointly pursued this case.
In response to these developments, the OSC has released a public advisory urging those approached by Pleterski or Murphy to report their experiences.
This appeal has proven fruitful, providing critical information that has benefited the ongoing investigation.
Canada’s Stance On Crypto
The charges against Pleterski and Murphy come when institutional interest in crypto noticeably increases in Canada.
According to a recent survey by KPMG in Canada and the Canadian Association of Alternative Assets and Strategies (CAASA), institutional investors have significantly increased their adoption of crypto assets.
Approximately 39% of these investors reported exposure to digital currencies in 2023, a notable rise from 31% two years earlier. Many institutions allocate at least 10% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, demonstrating a growing confidence in this asset class.
This trend is complemented by expanding the range of digital currency-related services offered by Canadian financial institutions. About half of the surveyed financial service organizations now provide at least one type of crypto service, from trading platforms to custody solutions and quantitative trading strategies.
This expansion reflects a broader belief in the potential of digital currencies and a supportive regulatory environment in Canada.
The US-based crypto exchange Coinbase announced a significant regulatory milestone in Canada amid these developments. The company has obtained a registration license as a restricted dealer in Ontario under Canadian Securities Administrators’ (CSA) oversight.

This registration allows Coinbase to conduct digital currency asset transactions in compliance with Canadian regulatory standards, further solidifying the country’s position as a welcoming environment for crypto innovation and investment.

Eclipse Labs appoints new CEO after investors ‘urge’ founder to resign - AMBCrypto



Eclipse Labs replaced Neel Somani with Vijay Chetty as the firm’s new CEO
Investors, led by Hack VC, could have played a role in the change in management 

Eclipse Labs has replaced its founder and former CEO Neel Soman with Vijay Chetty, following the spate of sexual harassment allegations levelled at him. Last week, the founder of the Ethereum [ETH] L2 scaling solution had denied the allegations, stating that he would remain an active CEO, but reduce his ‘public role’ at the firm. 
However, on Wednesday, Eclipse announced the promotion of Chetty, the firm’s Chief Growth Officer, to CEO. Part of the firm’s statement read, 
“Operational update on behalf of Eclipse Labs: “Effective immediately, Vijay Chetty will be named CEO of Eclipse Labs, taking over for Neel Somani, who is departing.”
Possible investors’ influence on Eclipse Labs’ reshuffle
The latest changes seem to have been influenced by Eclipse’s investors. In fact, one of the investors, Hack VC, acknowledged that along with other investors, they ‘urged’ Somani to resign after these allegations came to light.
“Since learning about the allegations, we worked hard with other investors and the team to correct the situation, including urging Neel to resign, and we are pleased to see that happen.” 
Hack VC and Placeholder were among Eclipse Labs’ initial investors, contributing $50 million in March 2024. Other investors joined in the later funding rounds to support Eclipse Labs, the development team behind the upcoming launch of Eclipse Mainnet. 
Surprisingly, another investor, Dragon Capital, claimed it didn’t invest in Eclipse Labs after reportedly learning of sexual assault ‘rumors.’
Thus, there could have been investor intervention to save the first Ethereum scaling solution that uses Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) from negative publicity. Part of the Hack VC statement read, 
“We do not tolerate sexual harassment or misconduct in any form at Hack VC, and we hold our founders and portfolio companies to the same high standards.”
The market will now shift its focus to the Eclipse Mainnet launch under the new leadership. Eclipse Labs has scheduled the launch for Q2.

How Jenndefer Became a Crypto Twitter Main Character via 'Fantasy Top' - Decrypt

Jennifer Duong, aka Jenndefer, has far fewer Twitter (aka X) followers than some of her Fantasy Top "hero" compatriots. But the influencer-driven crypto game has quickly turned her into one of Crypto Twitter’s main characters, as has her other content around Blast.Jenndefer quickly carved a niche for herself when she dove headfirst into Blast, the Ethereum layer-2 network known for its lucrative incentives ahead of an upcoming airdrop in late June.However, it was in Fantasy Top—a blockchain-based strategy game that blends elements of trading cards, RPGs, and digital collectibles—where Jenndefer truly gained prominence, becoming one of the first in-game cards. In Fantasy Top, players build teams of NFT-based heroes to compete in tournaments, earn rewards, and climb the leaderboards.Jenndefer's meticulous approach and work ethic garnered her recognition as a prominent "hero" in the game, despite having far fewer followers than many of the other influencers and content creators picked to star in the game. Now, with Fantasy Top’s Main Tournament 2 underway, all eyes are on the selected “heroes” of the game to deliver for players.Many are already betting on her to win, with one of her cards selling for 13.37 ETH ($40,000) earlier this week. Her prominence in the game, paired with her video content around both Fantasy Top and the burgeoning Blast ecosystem, has quickly given her a much larger platform than even just weeks ago.“Fantasy Top is insane,” Jenndefer said in an interview with Decrypt. “You collect influencers in the form of NFT trading cards, just like a fantasy league, you make your team and speculate on their performance on X, and enter them into tournaments.”She adds that the huge incentives on Blast are what draws users, giving rewards for things that people are already doing—like interacting and creating on social media. Jenndefer began her Blast journey before Pacmoon came around, but says the meme coin grabbed her attention thanks to its uniquely decentralized approach to getting Crypto Twitter users to spread the word.Pacmoon has built a model to reward creators while creating a flywheel virality effect on the timeline. Basically, instead of the typical social farming—“tag us, like this, repost this”—marketing tactic that many other projects use, Pacmoon flipped the script, figuring out how to mobilize a community of creators to make their own content.The model is simple: Users can be rewarded for making quality content that is about or incorporates Pacmoon in a meaningful way. If the main Pacmoon Twitter account likes the post, then it becomes eligible to earn points. Those points are then converted to Pacmoon tokens.“Since Pacmoon was so new and Blast was so new, I very much viewed it as a leveraged bet on culture and Blast,” Jenn Defer said. “Memes and NFTs are just leveraged bets on the ecosystem.”Swift influenceJenndefer's strategy extends beyond Fantasy Top gameplay. She has cultivated shares and engagement by creating in-depth videos on the crypto space. Her transparency about her wins and losses makes her content relatable, while her willingness to help new players navigate the complexities of crypto has earned her respect.She shared that climbed onto the Pacmoon leaderboards by grouping Pacmoon into culture on her video updates while tagging the account.”This was when my Blast content was really first starting to take off,” she told Decrypt. “Then of course, there's just some other more organic tweets that come with being active and engaged with the community. It’s insane how engaged the community is—the vibes are truly immaculate.”After placing 7th in the first main Fantasy Top tournament, Jenndefer said she was locked in for the next one that’s currently underway. She credits Taylor Swift as her personal hero and inspiration, often referencing her music in her posts. She relates to Swift’s ability to rise from difficulties, tendency to be underestimated, and ability to capture attention in a relevant way.“Swift is the queen of hype, connection, and authenticity, she said. “How could you not aspire to be like that?”When asked about her goals beyond Fantasy Top and how this journey has changed her life, she said it’s been a blessing—even if the added attention has come with some frustrations in the form of botted engagement. But she’s working to take advantage of the increased spotlight that’s now shining on her.“My long-term goal is to keep figuring out how to bridge education-focused content with storytelling— short-form and long-form doc style,” said Jenndefer.“I want to tell the user stories and builder stories,” she added, “and do it in a way where you don’t have to be an active participant in the space to follow along and to learn.”Edited by Andrew HaywardEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to clarify her entrance into the Blast ecosystem.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Understanding Validiums and Volitions | Bankless


Lens is an open social network project that, along with Warpcast and Friend.tech, is among the biggest names in the contemporary crypto social scene.To date, Lens has relied on an infra combo of Polygon and Momoka, the latter being a bespoke data availability solution, to power its decentralized app ecosystem. That’s why Lens made waves this week when it announced it was building a new chain, Lens Network, to support its future via zkSync’s ZK stack framework. This new network will start as a Layer 2 (L2) solution known as a validium and later evolve into a volition. Many people don’t know exactly what these solutions are and why they matter, so let’s break them down.The Basics of Validiums and Volitionsvia LensBy now, you’re likely familiar with ZK rollups like Starknet, zkSync Era, and Linea. These L2s execute transactions offchain and use zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for onchain data, i.e. validating and batching transactions to Ethereum.Conversely, when you combine offchain execution with onchain data via fraud proofs instead of ZKPs, you get optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism. That said, if you imagine the Ethereum scaling scene like a tree, validiums and volitions are solutions that branch out on the ZK side past ZK rollups. They’re both focused on facilitating high transaction throughput in a decentralized fashion, yet they approach this challenge differently. Let’s compare them below. ValidiumsValidiums are a type of L2 that use ZKPs for transaction validation but store data offchain in a separate data availability (DA) layer. The main points to remember here:Offchain DA: Unlike ZK rollups, which post data onchain, validiums keep transaction data offchain in a DA provider. This separation reduces costs significantly since storing data on Ethereum can be expensive.High Throughput: By offloading data storage, validiums can achieve impressive transaction throughput levels, e.g. in the ballpark of tens of thousands of transactions per second (TPS).Trusted Security: While validiums offer strong cryptographic guarantees for transaction validity through ZKPs, their reliance on offchain data availability introduces a trust element. Users must trust the DA provider to make data available when needed.Use Cases: Validiums are well-suited for apps that require high throughput and can tolerate some trust in data availability, such as social networks, gaming, and non-financial transactions.VolitionsVolitions are a hybrid scaling solution that combines the best features of ZK rollups and validiums. They allow users or apps to choose between onchain and offchain DA for different transactions within the same network. The big ideas:Flexible DA: Volitions allow users to choose to use onchain data availability (like zk-rollups) for high-security transactions and offchain data availability (like validiums) for less critical transactions. This choice can be made on a per-transaction basis.Scalability and Security: By enabling this hybrid approach, volitions can optimize for both cost and security, catering to a wide range of use cases without compromising scalability and ensuring users can tailor their security needs based on the nature of their transactions.Use Cases: Volitions are ideal for complex projects like decentralized social networks or financial apps that need the flexibility to dynamically balance transaction costs, speed, and security.The Lens Network Examplevia LensThere are a couple of validiums active in the cryptoeconomy today that you may recognize, like Immutable X and Sorare. The Lens team is looking to join the ranks of these projects and become one of the first volitions to launch through its phased rollout of Lens Network. The first phase will see the chain launch as a validium, while the second will see separate public and private validiums launched to support privacy use cases. The final phase will see Lens Network evolve into a volition so its users can switch between ZK rollup and validium capabilities as they please. The mission? Create a new hub for the Lens ecosystem that can scale up to support billions of transactions in the future. Why zkSync’s ZK Stackvia zkSyncAs mentioned earlier, the ZK Stack is a framework designed for readily creating ZK Chains. It offers several unique benefits that align with the goals of Lens Network:Modular Architecture: The ZK stack allows for customizability, enabling Lens Network to tailor its features to specific needs, such as DA options and transaction processing methods.High Security: Using ZKPs ensures that all transactions are cryptographically secure, which is critical for maintaining user trust and network integrity.Scalability: The Lens Network can handle a massive number of transactions by using a combination of validiums and volitions, making it suitable for a social network looking to grow to millions of active users.Interoperability: zkSync’s framework supports interoperability with other chains and apps via hyperbridges, which is crucial for facilitating an integrated social ecosystem.All in all, as the Lens team completes this L2 transition, it will likely inspire a new wave of projects to take a closer look at what the ZK Stack, and validiums and volitions in general, have to offer. The need for crypto infra that can handle complex, high-throughput use cases will only grow.Of course, the endgame is facilitating apps that are indistinguishable from mainstream apps today when it comes to UX, and Lens Network is just the latest demonstration that that vision is coming closer into focus. In the meantime, keep an eye on the progress of the L2 and others like it going forward.

Bitcoin moves toward range highs but derivatives traders watch from the sidelines

Bitcoin (BTC) gained 8.4% between May 15 and May 16, peaking at $66,750, which was the highest level in three weeks. Even though Bitcoin stabilized near $65,000, this price change marks a turnaround after BTC retested the $57,000 support on May 1. However, these gains were not enough to instill bullishness according to Bitcoin derivatives metrics.What’s behind Bitcoin’s lackluster performance?Part of Bitcoin investors' disappointment can be attributed to the strong performance of traditional assets. The S&P 500 index soared to an all-time high on May 16, with a total gain of 6% over 15 days. Meanwhile, gold gained 4% in the same period and is currently trading at $2,375, less than 1% away from its highest closing price ever.Bitcoin needs to rally another 12% to reclaim its highest closing price of $73,084. This feat seems unlikely given that the primary driver of price, namely spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) inflows, has faded. These ETFs captured $12.1 billion in investments since their launch in January but have stagnated for the past two months.The worsening regulatory environment, especially in the U.S., might explain why investors are hesitant to buy Bitcoin using derivatives despite the recent price strength. On May 6, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair Rostin Behnam warned that further enforcement actions would be taken against the crypto ecosystem over the next six months to two years.Additionally, U.S. regulators have multiple pending cases against crypto firms, including Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Recent enforcement actions against privacy-focused services and broker-dealers like Robinhood have also contributed to the uncertainty. The lack of a clear legislative framework and jurisdictional clarity limits the appetite of Bitcoin investors.Moreover, cryptocurrencies received negative media attention after the arrest of 193 suspects for money laundering using stablecoins in China. Authorities alleged on May 15 that these individuals transferred $1.9 billion using stablecoins to smuggle items and investments overseas. Additionally, on May 1, a couple of U.S. Senators requested an investigation into the use of cryptocurrencies to fund terrorist organizations in the Middle East.Bitcoin derivatives are flat despite the rally above $66,000To understand whether whales’ sentiment has been affected by the worsening regulatory environment, one should analyze data from BTC futures markets. The top traders' long-to-short ratio consolidates positions across spot, perpetual, and quarterly futures contracts, offering a comprehensive view of how bullish or bearish these traders are.Exchanges’ top traders BTC long-to-short ratio. Source: CoinglassAt OKX, the current long-to-short ratio stands at 0.96, indicating that bulls and bears have roughly equal positions. However, this is a less optimistic stance compared to May 14, when the indicator stood at 1.25, favoring longs. Similarly, Binance top traders are now less bullish compared to May 14, as the long-to-short ratio declined to 1.14 from 1.31.Related: Bitcoin whale demand accelerates, but price jump could ‘take weeks’ — AnalystsTo assess the appetite of retail traders, one should focus on perpetual futures, also known as inverse swaps. These contracts incorporate an embedded rate recalculated every eight hours to compensate for leverage demand imbalances. Essentially, a negative rate indicates a preference for leverage being utilized by shorts (sellers).Bitcoin perpetual futures average 8-hour funding rate. Source: CoinglassNote how Bitcoin’s funding rate has stayed below 0.01% for the past month, signaling balanced demand between longs and shorts. According to derivatives metrics, not even the recent rally above $66,000 was able to instill confidence in retail traders.In essence, investors are not confident in placing bullish bets as regulatory uncertainty persists. On the bright side, if Bitcoin eventually breaks above $68,000, most traders will be caught by surprise, potentially fueling the rally as there is room for bullish leverage.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Why First Ethereum MEV Case Is Seen as a Double Standard - DailyCoin


        
The U.S. DOJ has charged two brothers for fraud in an MEV-related exploit.



The Ethereum MEV case is the first of its kind.



The case has sparked heated debates on potential double standards.
MEV operators can front-run you, but front-running them is a crime?That’s the debate that has followed the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) decision to sue two brothers for fraud for orchestrating an attack on Ethereum trading bots called MEV (maximum extractable value) bots, programs designed to scour the blockchain for profitable front-running opportunities, that earned them $25 million in April 2023.A First of its Kind CaseOn Wednesday, May 15, the DOJ unsealed an indictment charging 24-year-old Anton Peraire-Bueno and 28-year-old James Pepaire-Bueno for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering for a “novel scheme” targeting MEV bots that saw them make off with $25 million.
“This alleged scheme was novel and has never before been charged,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York noted in a statement, highlighting that the case was the first of its kind.As alleged in the DOJ filing, the exploit was a months-long plot that saw the duo create 16 validators and exploit the MEV boost relay, software that would have typically prevented them from viewing and front-running MEV transactions. In simple terms, the duo baited MEV bots they targeted to place buy orders, pumping the price of illiquid tokens they held only to dump on the bots, leaving them holding the bag while making off with a $25 million loot. The entire exploit took only 12 seconds.While the DOJ argues that the brothers’ actions amount to fraud, several crypto community members have been left wondering how MEV can be tolerated while the brothers’ actions are dubbed fraud.How MEV WorksMEV refers to the profit market participants can make from reordering transactions on the Ethereum network before they are processed. Essentially, these network participants, typically autonomous software called searchers, leverage the transparency of the mempool (a waiting room for transactions on the blockchain) to identify high-value transactions and front-run them for profit. 
They execute a similar transaction to the target transaction before it is processed, pumping the price so they can then quickly sell for a profit. The catch: this profit is usually at the expense of users who are forced to complete orders at a higher price than planned.“Thieves Stealing From the Thieves?”For many in the Ethereum community, the actions of MEV operators can be likened to theft, as their business is essentially making a profit at the expense of users."If you steal from regular users, then you're just a sandwich attacker. If you steal from the sandwich attackers, you get criminally charged by the DOJ. Huh?" asserted "Fishy Catfish."Chiming in, Ethereum developer Lefteris Karapetsas quipped: “Please make it somehow make sense.”DeFi Analyst Chris Blec added, “thieves stealing from the thieves.. gotta love it.”Brookwood P.C. Managing Partner Collins Belton noted that the key differentiator between MEV operators and the indicted brothers was the latter’s use of false signatures to exploit the MEV relay boost to see the typically private MEV transactions. His statements suggested that this exploit may be what the DOJ’s case may hinge on.At the same time, per the DOJ’s filing, the indicted brothers appeared to know they were breaking the law. Their web search history allegedly included “how to wash crypto,” “cefi exchanges with no kyc,” “top crypto lawyers,” and “wire fraud statute/wire fraud statute of limitations.”On the Flipside

Why Did DeGods Leave Solana for Ethereum? 'I Was Just Being a Pussy', Says Founder - Decrypt

In a candid tweet Thursday, DeGods and y00ts NFT project founder Rohun Vora (aka Frank DeGods) took a critical look at his previous decisions, especially those made during tumultuous times for the well-known collections. His reflection sheds light on the pressures of community expectations and being a founder.“I used to try to move mountains to appease the community in times of chaos," he began. "Every single time it's backfired."Throughout the years as the leader of DeGods, he has made many decisions to try and please his holders and keep the buzz going. For example, the team went through many art changes, including a planned upgrade and self-proclaimed art “downgrade.” On Thursday, the team said that it would make no further art changes to DeGods.But the biggest and most controversial move was bridging DeGods NFTs from Solana to Ethereum last year, along with y00ts from Solana to Ethereum sidechain network Polygon—though they then moved y00ts to the Ethereum mainnet and returned a $3 million grant from Polygon Labs.Making the decision to bridge the projects off of the Solana blockchain happened as the community was in a state of panic following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022, which preceded Solana’s price collapsing to a low of about $8—roughly 97% from its 2021 peak.Frank, feeling the pressure, made the call to move the projects to the Ethereum ecosystem, which houses the most valuable NFT projects. He framed the move at the time as one designed to elevate DeGods into the big leagues of NFT culture."Like the bridge off SOL,” Frank wrote. “Everyone in the community was panicking (myself included) during FTX. I tried to fix their anxiety. In reality, I was just being a pussy."Frank contrasted his past actions with his current mindset, emphasizing the importance of standing by your convictions."The truth is, on the internet you either stand by your convictions or you're a pussy," he tweeted. Frank stressed that succumbing to short-term pressures and seeking immediate approval often backfires. It’s a lesson he learned by leading one of the most prominent NFT projects, and one that has faced considerable challenges—many self-inflicted, as he admitted.Frank recently announced the launch of an optional bridge back to Solana for both DeGods and y00ts. This move allows the community to decide whether to stay on Ethereum or return to Solana, reflecting his desire to provide flexibility and choice. There are no strong-armed incentives this time around. It's just an option."I said I want to allow our community to come back home and I meant it. I still do,” he wrote, though they launched the latest bridge with decidedly less fanfare than the original.Decrypt reached out to Frank for additional comment, but did not receive an immediate response.Frank’s tweet offers a raw and honest look at the challenges of leading an NFT project amid the constant demands of holders, particularly amid a diminished market for such assets. The bridge back to Solana and increasing openness about the past appear to be moves to atone for lingering regrets, all while the projects attempt to move forward.Looking forward, Frank expressed his belief in building a robust and resilient community, rather than one that constantly seeks validation through reactive measures."I believe that antifragility is the answer,” he wrote. “That's my conviction. Not just building the best community, but the strongest one."Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started, Says Anthony Scaramucci

                        Skybridge Capital co-founder Anthony Scarmucci believes new entrants to Bitcoin are still early, with institutional adoption of the asset only just ramping up.Anthony Scaramucci On Institutional Bitcoin Investment
During an interview with CNBC on Thursday, the investor said that institutional adoption is “happening now,” and that he expects more pension funds to reveal soon that they have allocations to BTC.“Bitcoin now has the regulatory approval – that was the rate-limiting step for a lot of these large-scale institutions,” Scaramucci explained. “Just remember, if you’re not long Bitcoin, then you’re possibly short Bitcoin.”Leading up to May 15, nearly 1000 large investors with over $100 million in assets disclosed owning at least one of the U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs in their securities portfolios. One of those investors included the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB), which disclosed a $162 million allocation to the ETFs this week.According to Scaramucci, institutions are dipping their toes into BTC before it becomes part of a “total tactical asset allocation index.”Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan backed this view on Tuesday, predicting that institutions could begin to devote between 1% and 5% of their portfolios to BTC as they tentatively expose client funds to the asset.How High Can Bitcoin Go?
When asked why Bitcoin would attract such widespread adoption, Scaramucci said he was in the “digital gold category” – a subset of investors who see the asset’s primary use case as a store of value rather than a medium of exchange. MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor falls into this camp, having previously called Bitcoin’s use case as currency “a distraction.”“Sometimes when you’re early you get a lot of bumps and scrapes, but I think it pays to be early in Bitcoin, and I think we’re still early in Bitcoin,” he concluded.Earlier this year, Scaramucci predicted that Bitcoin could reach $170,000 per coin by the end of 2025.

Analyst Says Dogecoin Is Set To Breakout: How This Could Trigger Another Meme Coin Mania | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin is once again seeing an upside following the Bitcoin recovery above $66,000, which, in turn, triggered a broader crypto market recovery. Crypto analyst Crypto Scient expects this bullishness to continue going forward and eventually lead to the start of another meme coin mania.
Dogecoin Set To Kickstart Meme Coin Mania
Presently, the Dogecoin price is not as bullish as expected since it continues to struggle to break out of $0.15. However, it has not eroded expectations for the meme coin as crypto analysts continue to predict that its price still has room to rally.

Crypto Scient is the latest in the long line of analysts who believe this, expecting the meme coin to flip bullish at some point. As he explains, once the Dogecoin price flips bullish, it’ll trigger the start of another meme coin mania as other meme coins start to move with it, similar to what was seen in February 2024.
The crypto analyst points to a break above $0.15 that could trigger another rally toward $0.2. Then, after this, he expects the meme coin to break and flip once again, but this time around, it is the $0.175 level. At this point, Crypto Scient expects a continuation signal for further upward rallies.
As for price targets, the top of the analyst’s target sits at $0.34. From the current level of around $0.155, it would mean an over 100% increase from here. However, even achieving this price point would still put it around 50% below its all-time high price of $0.7.
DOGE Metrics Flipping Bullish
Despite its price not performing as well as investors hoped, the steady rise in bullishness in Dogecoin metrics suggests that the meme coin could end up seeing a delayed rally. One of these metrics is the open interest.
Over the last 24 hours alone, the Dogecoin open interest has risen by over 10% to $869.54 million, according to data from Coinglass. This suggests a steady rise in interest in the altcoin among traders who are not open more positions on the meme coin. Historically, whenever open interest started rising, the DOGE price has followed as well.

Another metric that has seen a bullish reversal is the Dogecoin daily trading volume. CoinMarketCap’s data shows that DOGE’s daily trading volume has also seen an 11% increase during the last day, rising above $1.8 billion.
If these metrics hold and Dogecoin eventually flips bullish as Crypto Scient predicts, then a rally similar to what was seen in February could easily push it toward $0.4. However, for now, the meme coin continues to struggle at $0.154, indicating a small 3.24% increase in the last day.

End Of The Road For BNB After 200% Surge? Mounting Resistance Threatens Rally


																BNB, the native cryptocurrency of the BSC network, has undoubtedly been one of the winning altcoins scene the bull market began. The price has been able to go from around $200 to over $600 in the space of a year, notching over 200% gains in the process. However, it seems that this outperformance by the altcoin is coming to an end, as an analyst predicts that it is about to hit massive resistance that could stop its growth dead in its path.
BNB Headed For Mounting Resistance
In an analysis that was shared on the TradingView website, crypto analyst Trade City Pro revealed that the BNB token might have to fighting massive resistance soon. The analyst points out that this is a culmination of the bullish rally that the altcoin has seen in the last year, and now bears are maki g their stand.

	Related Reading



The analyst points to Bitcoin’s performance during this time as something that could help to pinpoint where the BNB price is headed next. As they explain, BNB risks falling into correction and consolidation after that, making its current level a perilous one for investors.
Mainly, the crypto analyst credits the altcoin’s performance from here on what Bitcoin does next. BNB, which is currently the 4th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, mirrors Bitcoin’s movements to a larger extent compared to smaller altcoins. So, Trade City Pro’s analysis with respect to Bitcoin is not far off.
For confirmation of whether the BNB token continues to be something to sell or hold, the analyst places the ultimate decision around the $48,000 level for Bitcoin. They explain that a dump below $48,000 would be a sell signal. However, if the Bitcoin price were to maintain strength above $48,000, then they would continue to hold the altcoin.
What Happens In The Event Of A Price Crash?
Should the BNB price crash from here, the crypto analyst has prepared an action plan that could help investors take advantage of it. For example, a Bitcoin crash below $48,000 could send the BNB price below $400, and at this level, the analyst believes buying would be a good move. This is what the analyst refers to as the “Potential Re-Entry” point.
Then, for “Entering After Resistance,” the analyst advises investors to buy the altcoin if the price is able to reclaim $616 and stay above it. This level is important because the $616-$660 range is identified in the analysis as a significant resistance zone, and so beating it is important for the BNB price to continue its rally.

Additionally, Trade City Pro adds that the Fibonacci Retracement Levels might offer a level for re-entry into the altcoin. “In case of a correction, the key Fibonacci levels from the last upward wave at 0.5 and 0.618 (between $394 to $430) might offer good entry points. Wait for a reaction or momentum change at these levels before entering,” they stated.
Lastly, the analyst points out that BNB has not really followed the broader market in recent times, which could mean something is coming. “It’s intriguing that BNB seems relatively unaffected by broader market conditions, suggesting Binance might be positioning for something unique,” Trade City Pro said in closing.

Optimism Price Analysis: Bullish Momentum Ahead?



Optimism (OP) prices are on the rise, currently trading between $2.33 and $2.86. In the last week, OP dropped by 6.49%, but the monthly view shows a 7.25% increase. Over six months, the coin has grown by 38.20%. The RSI at 62.04 suggests that OP is not overbought, while a high Stochastic of 93.63 could mean prices might take a pause. The MACD at 0.01 points to a neutral momentum. The coin is showing bullish signs as it hovers above its 10-day and 100-day moving averages of $2.45 and $2.49, respectively. With the nearest resistance at $3.19 and support at $2.14, optimism might be gearing up for an impulsive move towards higher prices.




Understanding Polygon (MATIC) Market Movements



The current price of Polygon (MATIC) is moving within a range of $0.63 to $0.74. Over the past week, it has dropped by 1.01%. It also decreased by 3.24% in the last month, and looking back six months, it fell by 18.70%. This suggests that the price movement is in a corrective phase. The RSI at 72.70 indicates the coin may be overbought. With prices below the first resistance of $0.82 and above the nearest support of $0.59, MATIC’s immediate future will likely depend on whether it can maintain its position above this support level.



Conclusion



In the surge of 2024’s bull run, several Layer 2 projects stand out, but short-term potentials for OP and MATIC seem modest compared to a more compelling option. BlastUP is at the forefront for investors focused on substantial growth. This project is gaining traction due to its innovative approach and the advantages offered by its integration with the Blast ecosystem. With its solid concept and ecosystem support, BlastUP is poised to outshine its peers in terms of potential.

Gamestop Moon (GMEMOON) to Skyrocket 9,000% as Huobi Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gamestop Moon (GMEMOON) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gamestop Moon (GMEMOON), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 9,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GMEMOON has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on Huobi.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gamestop Moon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gamestop Moon could become the next viral memecoin.



Gamestop Moon launched with over $7,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gamestop Moon on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the Huobi listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gamestop Moon by entering its contract address – Bpb4YRRLgpeQByou2kcffQFFx3FGhnqaHfba8wM315wH – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GMEMOON.

Ethereum Price Prediction as Daily Trading Volume Surpasses $10 Billion – Are Whales Accumulating ETH? / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Ethereum (ETH) price is under pressure on Thursday, having now fallen 3.3% on the back from above $3,040 to current levels around $2,930, amid high daily trading volumes of $13.5 billion, as per Yahoo Finance data.Ether has now all but erased Wednesday’s post US CPI gains, weighed as bearish sentiments creep back into the market.Following a recent death cross in the ETH/BTC pair, the Ether price is just hit new three-year lows.In a Wednesday note, Coinbase research analyst David Han gave a few reasons for ETH’s underperformance.“The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US has reinforced bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative and its status as a macro asset”.“On the other hand, open questions about ETH’s fundamental positioning within the crypto sector remain,” he continued.The SEC is expected to reject applications for multiple spot Ethereum ETFs in the US later this month.Many think this is because the SEC is still considering whether Ethereum might be considered a security.Moreover, “competing layer-1s like Solana detract from Ethereum’s positioning as the ‘go-to’ network for decentralized app (dApp) deployment,” Han said.Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade earlier this year has also lowered the crypto’s burn rate via a substantial drop in fees.That’s probably going to be a long-term positive for Ethereum’s adoption, as high fees discourage network use.But some have framed the lower burn rate as bearish for ETH.It’s no surprise then that Citron Research founder Andrew Left just told Benzinga that he shorted Ether.Ether will be labeled as a security and won’t get the same stamp of approval as Bitcoin, he posited.ETH/BTC remains locked within a multi-year downtrend. Whales may be reluctant to accumulate when the much safer, more accepted Bitcoin is looking so strong.ETH/BTC remains locked within a multi-year downtrend.

Whales would likely jump back into the market to accumulate if ETH retested this zone.Yes, things aren’t looking good for ETH relative to BTC. But we are still in the midst of a crypto bull market.And at $2,150, Ether would be at a near 50% discount from its earlier yearly high price.Ethereum Alternative to Consider
Ethereum’s decline comes at a time when meme coin season might be about to pick up once again.Without question, meme stock season has returned since GameStop icon Roaring Kitty returned to social media earlier this week.Investors looking for better upside prospects than those offered by ETH might want to position themselves in the meme coin market.Established meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are relatively “safe” bets that could yield 5x returns.For investors looking for 50-100x gains, they need to find newer meme coins.One new meme coin project that analysts at Cryptonews like a lot is Wiener AI (WAI).The fun new sausage dog-themed coin offers a suite of AI-powered trading tools.Investors have already ploughed nearly $2 million into the WAI presale.Interested investors better move quickly. When the presale hits $2.15 million, the WAI price will rise.Presale investors are also currently earnings huge staking yields of 499%, though this will fall as the presale progresses.Buy WAI Here

Solana Trader Turns $1,470 into $200,000 in Five-Minute Crypto Windfall | Cryptoglobe


                                
A cryptocurrency trader managed to, in the span of just 5 minutes, turn just 9 Solana ($SOL) tokens worth around $1,470 into 1,238 SOL worth over $200,000, to secure a gain of 137x in little time.



According to data shared by on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the trader spent the 9 SOL tokens to buy 28.58 million TOBI tokens, and after their purchase the price of the cryptocurrency started skyrocketing, a move that they used to dump their holdings back for SOL.



Their profit was of over $200,000 in just 5 minutes.







The trader’s gains come at a time in which cryptocurrency investment products focusing on Solana itself have been attracting institutional interest, with data from CoinShares showing that products offering exposure to SOL saw $5.9 million of inflows in a week, bringing their total year-to-date flows to $17 million. Polkadot (DOT), XRP and Litecoin (LTC) investment products followed suit, with $1.2 million, $600,000 and $100,000 inflows respectively.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The trader’s gains aren’t new to the Solana ecosystem, which has been seeing a memecoin mania where both insiders and opportunistic trader have been taking advantage of the growth of newly launched tokens to enrich themselves.



As reported, a patient’ cryptocurrency trader has recently managed to turn around $8,600 into over $1.26 million after investing in a little-known cryptocurrency and holding onto it for two months to secure their gain of 144x.



The trader’s gains come after another cryptocurrency trader managed to turn 500 SOL tokens worth around $67.000 into 5,789 SOL worth over $780,000 in just 15 minutes after managing to “snipe” a large portion of a newly launched cryptocurrency’s supply.



There have also been significant losses, with a Solana trader losing $37,000 while speculating on a memecoin over their emotional trading pattern.

The 50, 100, and 200 EMAs are also moving up, providing extra support and reinforcing the positive trend.PEPE/USDT Chart by TradingViewAnother important indicator is the RSI. Right now, the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which means PEPE might see some short-term pauses before moving up again. As long as the RSI stays above the middle line, the bullish trend should continue.Volume is also crucial. The recent increase in volume shows strong buying interest, which is essential for keeping the bull run going. Higher volumes usually mean more traders are active and confident. For PEPE to break its all-time high, it needs to keep these high trading volumes.Shiba Inu's revitalizedShiba Inu has faced a fundamental resistance level reflected in the 50 EMA formation. The asset is in active battle mode against it and the most recent price action suggests that buyers want to leave it behind. With some room for growth, SHIB needs one more push.SHIB's volume surge is a positive factor for the asset's price, but it's not a guarantee of an upcoming price rally. The surge in trading volume may indicate a surge of buying interest among investors, but the general market recovery remains a key factor for the beloved memecoin.If SHIB successfully breaks through, it could signal the start of a more extended upward movement.  It's an important moment for Shiba Inu: fighting to break through the 50 EMA resistance. The path ahead holds potential for growth, but it requires more buying power and higher trading volumes to confirm a bullish trend. In case of a breakthrough, it could signal the start of a longer upward movement. Solana breaks throughSolana has finally broken through a key resistance level, gaining a foothold above the 50 EMA. As TradingView's data suggests, Solana has reached the $160 price threshold and even moved past it. For now, the price needs some bullish conviction to stay afloat and push forward.Solana faces first resistance around $175, a level that has previously acted as a strong resistance. If Solana can break through this, the next target could be $190, another historical resistance level. On the downside, support is likely around $145, which has previously acted as a price reversal level. If it holds, it could provide a solid foundation for further upward movement.Volume is another important factor. The recent increase in trading volume indicates strong buying interest, which is necessary to sustain the current uptrend. Higher volumes generally mean more market participation and confidence among traders. For Solana to continue its upward movement, it needs to maintain or even increase this volume.Additionally, the Relative Strength Index is hovering around the midline, suggesting there is still room for growth before hitting overbought territory. This is a positive sign for further upward momentum.Solana’s recent break above the 50 EMA and the $160 mark is a strong signal of potential growth. With increased trading volume and positive RSI indicators, the outlook appears bullish.$175 and $190 resistance levels are ones to be watched. The volume is also crucial, we need it to ensure the uptrend continuation. If Solana can maintain this momentum, it could be on its way to even higher price levels.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin is trading just above $65,000, experiencing a 1.25% correction after a recent surge. This upward movement was driven by weaker US CPI data, dovish FOMC sentiment, and a break from a symmetrical triangle pattern.Despite this slight bearish correction, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish, especially with Andrew Tate’s announcement to invest $100 million in Bitcoin and decreasing BTC supply on exchanges.Bitcoin Supply on Exchanges Hits New Lows Amid Bullish Market
Bitcoin (BTC) supply on centralized exchanges (CEX) has dropped to new lows following strong market activity over the past 48 hours. According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges is now at 1,728,782 BTC, reflecting a significant decrease as bullish sentiment grows.In the last 24 hours, 23,654 BTC exited exchanges, with weekly outflows reaching 19,859 BTC. Monthly flows were also down, with only 9,509 BTC moving. This reduction suggests increasing bullish pressure as traders move their assets off exchanges.Key Points:
Binance saw 7,155 BTC outflows, while Coinbase Pro recorded 16,075 BTC outflows.
Mass migration from exchanges indicates long-term holding and bullish market sentiment.
Positive CPI data and new institutional spot ETF disclosures have fueled recent market activity.
This week, several traditional finance firms disclosed their exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs, further driving prices up.Andrew Tate Plans $100M Bitcoin Investment
Andrew Tate, a British-American social media personality and former professional kickboxer, has announced plans to invest heavily in bitcoin, expressing his dissatisfaction with traditional banks and their practices. “I’m about to leave fiat completely,” Tate declared. “I’m done with banks and their scams.”Tate shared his plans on the social media platform X, stating his intention to move away from fiat currency and invest $100 million in bitcoin.He emphasized his frustration with the banking system and expressed confidence in his decision, even planning to showcase his investment proof later.Key Points:
Tate intends to move $100 million from fiat to bitcoin.
He criticized banks, calling their practices scams.
Despite some skepticism from X users, Tate is committed to his crypto investment.
Andrew Tate, known for his controversial online presence and previous career as a kickboxer, has been involved in cryptocurrency-related news before. Romanian authorities seized significant assets from him, including Bitcoin. In a video by a criminal lawyer, Tate promoted Bitcoin for tax avoidance and hinted at launching his own cryptocurrency. He has also been a part of the meme stock movement, investing $6 million in Gamestop, despite his net worth being around $11 million.Looking at the technical side of the market, Bitcoin price prediction is showing signs of retracement, having dipped below the $66,600 level. It has already completed a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement around the $64,750 level, which is currently acting as major support for BTC and is also today’s pivot point. As long as Bitcoin holds above this level, the chances of a bullish bounce are high.In this scenario, the immediate resistance is likely to be around the $66,600 level. If Bitcoin breaks above this level, the next resistance would be around $67,820, with $69,000 acting as a further hurdle.Conversely, if the market continues to show a bearish correction, breaking below the $64,750 level could send BTC down to the $63,300 level.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewAdditionally, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the four-hour time frame is likely to support BTC around the $63,150 level, increasing the chances of a bullish bounce from this level. However, increased selling pressure could drive a bearish crossover below the 50-day EMA, with $61,500 or $61,200 likely to act as further support levels.Lastly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has already exited the overbought zone and is currently holding around 62, which is still in bullish territory.
Current Trend: We need to keep an eye on the $64,750 and $63,300 levels, as these are crucial for buyers. The chances of a buying trend above these levels remain strong.

Solana Restaking Protocol Solayer Reportedly Raised $20M in 45 Minutes | Cryptopolitan

Solayer Labs’s startup has soft-launched deposits into its Solana-based restaking protocol. The launch was highly successful, as the protocol raised $20 M in 45 minutes, maxing its limit according to Blockworks reports. The Solana-based restaking protocol soft-launched deposits that were restricted to an invite-only pool. The deposits allowed users to restake SOL on the protocol. Invite-only investors could deposit liquid staking products like Blaze-SOL, JITOSOL, INF, and Marinade-SOL.According to Blockworks, a Solayer team member confirmed that the protocol’s exclusive soft launch only took 45 minutes to hit the cap of $20 million.In a related report by Coindesk, the little-known Solana-based restaking protocol team member Rachel Chu said the firm was not far from raising $10 from well-known industry players, including Yakovenko. Yakovenko has previously been on the Sushiswap core developer team.Solayer Labs releases RoadmapThe restaking platform has reportedly been in development for quite some time now. It mainly focused on shared security infrastructure via restaking and horizontal scalability.Also Read: Solana Surges High as Robinhood Launches Sol Staking in EuropeThe released Roadmap outlines three key stages: restaking epochs, node operators, and shared validator networks.The team plans to release in the three mentioned phases to ease the onboarding process for investors.Solayer launches Stage 1 Genesis Private EpochStage 1 Genesis Private Epoch focuses primarily on a balanced security foundation.

India's securities watchdog calls for crypto regulation; Turkey moves toward licensing model

Turkey and India advanced crypto policies on May 16 that could create a framework for businesses and investors operating in each country.Reuters reported that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) wants multiple regulators to oversee crypto trading in the country.In its recommendation, SEBI said it could monitor crypto securities, oversee initial coin offerings (ICOs), and issue licenses for equity market-related products.Other agencies could regulate insurance and pension-related virtual assets, while the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would regulate fiat-backed cryptos.SEBI’s request is at odds with RBI’s position. The bank believes that private digital currencies are a macroeconomic risk. It expressed concerns about tax evasion, the need for voluntary compliance in P2P activities, and reduced profits from central bank money creation.SEBI and RBI outlined their position in documents submitted to a government panel for consideration, which Reuters said could “firm up its report as early as June.”Turkey’s draft lawReuters also reported that Turkey’s ruling party presented a draft law that aims to have crypto companies meet licensing and registration obligations.If the proposed regulations succeed, crypto exchanges and other companies must obtain licenses from Turkey’s Capital Markets Board.The draft law outlines requirements and liabilities regarding platform management, offerable services, and operational standards. It aims to regulate certain activities, including crypto purchases, sales, and transfers among individuals in Turkey and crypto storage.The law would also grant the Capital Markets Board authority to advance secondary regulation and create regulatory procedures for companies and their transactions.Strict crypto stancesIndia and Turkey both have strict crypto policies.In 2021, Turkey banned the use of crypto in payments, listing a lack of regulatory controls, use in illegal activities, theft, and irreversible transactions among its concerns.In 2018, India’s Reserve Bank banned financial institutions from engaging with companies that work with crypto. Though the rule was later overturned, broader financial regulations apply, and the Reserve Bank continues to urge against legalization.India has also taken other actions against crypto, including issuing compliance notices to foreign crypto exchanges and imposing IP bans on the exchanges.Accordingly, each of the latest developments advances regulations that could accommodate crypto activities in countries known for their harsh policies.Latest Alpha Market Report

Foundation for Next Altcoin Hype Cycle Now Setting Up, Says Crypto Trader - Here’s His Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst says that altcoins are setting the stage for a massive breakout by July.
Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 467,200 followers on the social media platform X that an alt “hype cycle” is likely coming in the second quarter of the year as the market consolidates.










“Still time left before the Q2 altcoin hype cycle takes off. But the very foundations of the next wave of altcoin rallies are being built as we speak. Market-wide breakouts can’t occur without the market first experiencing slow consolidation periods.”



Source: Rekt Capital/X



Next up, the analyst says if Bitcoin follows a historic precedent the crypto king’s cycle top will likely arrive next year in September or October.
“In the 2015-2017 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 518 days after the halving. In the 2019-2021 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 546 days after the halving. If history repeats and the next bull market peak occurs 518-546 days after the halving that would mean Bitcoin could peak in this cycle in mid-September 2025 or mid-October 2025. 
Currently, Bitcoin is accelerating in this cycle by approximately 200 days now. So the longer Bitcoin consolidates after the halving, the better it will be for resynchronizing this current cycle with the traditional halving cycle.”

Morgan Stanley's Bitcoin ETF Position Exposed: Filing Discloses $270 Million In Holdings | Bitcoinist.com


								In a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Morgan Stanley, the American multinational investment bank and financial services company, disclosed its substantial investments in the newly approved Bitcoin ETF market. 
The bank’s filing revealed holdings in two prominent Bitcoin exchange-traded funds: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Ark Invest’s ETF.
Morgan Stanley’s Multi-Million Dollar Bet
According to Fintel data, Morgan Stanley purchased 31,712 shares of Ark’s 21Shares ETF (ARKB), while also allocating an impressive $269 million to the Grayscale ETF. This significant investment propelled Morgan Stanley into the top 20 list of Ark’s ETF investors and established it as the third-largest holder of GBTC ETF shares.

These developments come on the heels of Morgan Stanley’s recent filing with the SEC, where it sought approval to incorporate spot Bitcoin ETFs into 12 of its investment funds. 
In addition, the bank previously announced plans to allow 15,000 brokers to recommend spot Bitcoin ETF investments to their clients, making Morgan Stanley the first multinational investment bank to solicit client investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs actively.
Institutional Giants’ Investments In The Bitcoin ETF Market
This increased interest from Morgan Stanley, coupled with other institutional players, has the potential to revolutionize the cryptocurrency market and mark a new era of acceptance within traditional finance. 
In one of the most significant investments in the ETF market in recent weeks, Millennium Management, a firm managing over $64 billion in assets, recently invested an unprecedented $2 billion in multiple Bitcoin ETFs.
Furthermore, the Wisconsin Investment Board acquired $98.6 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s ETF. Bracebridge Capital, a Boston-based hedge fund, reported significant investments in Ark Invest’s ARKB ETF and BlackRock’s IBIT.
In recent data from SoSo Value, Bitcoin spot ETFs experienced a net inflow of $303 million during Wednesday’s trading session, with Grayscale’s GBTC seeing a single-day inflow of $27.0466 million. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF attracted $131 million, while Bitwise’s BITB ETF recorded an inflow of $86.2578 million.

The entry of these institutional powerhouses into the cryptocurrency space signals a growing recognition of the potential for substantial returns and long-term viability. This endorsement could pave the way for an influx of institutional capital, further boosting the appeal and value of the largest cryptocurrency in the market.
As Wall Street giants embrace Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market, it is becoming increasingly clear that digital assets are gaining recognition as viable investment options.

How to predict Bitcoin cycle tops using GameStop and GME's social volume - AMBCrypto



How much correlation does GME’s rally and its social volume have with Bitcoin’s price trends?
Impact of the same was seen on the higher timeframes during the previous cycle

Bitcoin [BTC] climbed above its short-term local resistance at $64.5k on 15 May, just two days after GameStop [GME] posted a 284% rally measured from last Friday. According to a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Santiment claimed that the GME craze had in fact bled over into crypto.
Given the speculative nature of the crypto-market, especially in the memecoin sector, this overlap makes sense. To find out whether crowd sentiment can mark cycle tops and bottoms, AMBCrypto searched for more parallels.
Short-term top and bottom coincided with increased social activity

In the short term, GME/AMC social mentions did mark Bitcoin’s top and bottom over the last three days. And yet, it might not be that these social trends foreshadowed a shift in trend. It’s more likely that they merely coincided with them.
13 May was the Monday after the weekend when Roaring Kitty marked the end of a 3-year hibernation with a meme on X (formerly Twitter). On 15 May, the Consumer Price Index and inflation data came out too, and it came out lower than anticipated. This led to greater risk-taking tendencies among participants.

GameStop’s social volume was extraordinarily high in January and November of 2021. In January 2021, Bitcoin prices had just recovered from a deep retracement to $31k, before resuming its blistering rally.
On the other hand, November 2021’s social volume surge marked the top for the crypto, and BTC prices soon began to slump. Hence, even though the recent correlation has an explanation, there may be some substance to Santiment’s latest observations.
Traders and investors might want to keep an eye on these metrics in the future.
What about the altcoin market’s capitalization?
Source: TOTAL.3 on TradingView
The January and November 2021 GME social volume spikes coincided not just with Bitcoin’s rally and tops, but also with the altcoin market’s capitalization. However, the May 2024 one did not. In fact, altcoins’ market cap has been expanding since October 2023.

In conclusion, the relationship appears to be that of a surge in GME social activity strengthening a prevailing bullish trend in the crypto-market. However, it will not necessarily manufacture one.

AI Can Detect Sarcasm With Help From ‘Friends’?-Yeah, Right! - Decrypt

In a breakthrough that could potentially save marriages, friendships, and countless misunderstandings, scientists say they have built an AI-powered sarcasm detection tool.A group of researchers from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands claim they have developed an AI system that can tell whether you’re being straight and serious, or deploying some sly, humorous wit.Their work was presented today at a meeting of the Acoustical Society of America in Ottawa, and combines text and voice analysis. The team is led by graduate student Xiyuan Gao, who has been "tackling the challenge of figurative language" as part of her academic research.Gao didn’t immediately respond to a request for comments by Decrypt.A research paper outlines the team's approach to sarcasm detection.First, they trained a neural network on multi-modal data—audio clips, transcribed text, and annotated emotional content—from sarcasm-laden scenes in sitcoms like “Friends” and “The Big Bang Theory” obtained from the MUStARD database.They next developed an algorithm to map emotional cues from the audio and text, and assigned appropriate emoticons based on sentiment analysis. This made the AI more powerful at detecting sarcasm based on a multi-faceted approach, beating other tools that rely on text and voice pitch changes alone."Our methodology leverages the strengths of each modality: emotion recognition algorithms analyze the audio data for affective cues, while sentiment analysis processes the text,” the research paper explains. “The integration of these modalities aims to compensate for limitations in pitch perception."The AI detected sarcasm in new sitcom scenes with around 75% accuracy. The researchers admit, however, humans still edge out machines in this particular perception test."When you start studying sarcasm, you become hyper-aware of the extent to which we use it as part of our normal mode of communication,” Matt Coler, another researcher working on the project, told The Guardian. “We have to speak to our devices in a very literal way, as if we’re talking to a robot, because we are.“It doesn’t have to be this way," he added.This sarcasm detection tool is only the latest attempt to find the hidden sentiment or meaning in human language, and is becoming increasingly important as the explosive adoption of AI chatbots means millions of daily conversations with large language models (LLM).For example, Hume AI says it developed an AI system to detect different inflections in the voice to identify a range of emotions, not just a change in tone or mood.Hume is designed to understand and respond to human emotions in a more nuanced and empathetic way, making AI interactions more natural and engaging, the company explains.Meanwhile, a team from the Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences and the University of Oulu in Finland published a research paper last month exploring contactless techniques in multimodal emotion recognition.The team similarly found that the most accurate way to analyze emotions is by merging visual, audio, and text cues together. However, they emphasized that this type of understanding is still limited by cultural variables, inherent model biases, misinterpretations, and the lack of understanding of past context.Other researchers have tried to analyze the use of emojis to properly detect the emotional state of the people using them. After all, a text message followed by a winking face emoji can have a very different meaning than a one without the illustration, or with a different emoji.While the capability to adapt to richer nuance in conversations will help AI chatbots better answer prompts from humans, it could have far-reaching implications for society in general. In addition to detecting unwritten negative tone in language or identifying hate speech, it could also smooth interpersonal relationships, providing greater clarity in moments of confusion—especially for people communicating across languages or with neurodivergent conditions.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

                        South Korean police have arrested 34 people in a raid on a suspected crypto-powered drugs smuggling ring, officers announced on May 16.Per Newsis, police seized 90,000 doses of drugs including methamphetamine (crystal meth), synthetic marijuana, and ketamine.Officers said the ring used Vietnam-based smugglers to hide the drugs in cosmetics products.Gang members then allegedly sent these products to South Korea via international courier services.Crypto-powered Drugs Smuggling Ring ‘Hid Narcotics on Mountain’
Police said they had remanded nine people in custody, including two suspected South Korean ringleaders (both aged 36).Officers added that they had charged 25 other people with related crimes. Police say the ring was active from August 2023 to April this year.A police spokesperson added that the ring sold the narcotics online to crypto-paying buyers. The group reportedly made use of Telegram as a communications tool.Items seized by the police in raids. (Source: Chungbuk Provincial Police Agency)Recent reports have claimed that Korean-language Telegram channels have become a “department store” for drug buyers and dealers.Chungbuk Police Agency said its criminal task force’s drug crime investigation unit carried out the raids.A police spokesperson explained that the suspected masterminds hid the drugs they received in a “hole in a mountainside.”When police investigated this hiding place, they found almost six liters of synthetic marijuana solution.This haul alone is “worth over $1 million” on the domestic market, officers told reporters.Investigators also found 181g of methamphetamine and 31g of ketamine, all “buried under the ground in the countryside.”Officers said that gang members would periodically come to the hiding place to divide the synthetic marijuana “into 10ml units (vials).”They would then “sell these through social media channels such as Telegram.” In each case, recipients would “pay in cryptocurrency,” police said.The headquarters of the Chungbuk Provincial Police Agency.

Police released photographs of lipstick and other cosmetics containers. They explained that the gang hid drugs inside these containers before sending them from Vietnam.Officers said they had also seized funds worth over $245,000. They added that the investigation is ongoing.The spokesperson said police suspect that “other people” may be involved, “including overseas suppliers.”Park Ji-hwan, the unit’s head, said all the cases had been handed over to the prosecution service.The police chief also called on the public to “report any suspected instances” of crypto-powered drug crime “to the investigative agencies.”Last year, President Yoon Suk-yeol declared an “all-out war” on crypto-powered drug trafficking, following a massive boom in youth drug crime.

Sony Puts Over 700 AI Firms on Blast Over Music Copyright Violations - Decrypt

Sony Music Group has made a broad preemptive strike against artificial intelligence, putting AI companies on notice that it will not allow its music to be used for model training. In its “Declaration of AI Training Opt Out,” the multinational media giant's New York-based music division said on Thursday that AI developers are prohibited from using SMG’s vast catalog of musical content.In addition to publishing the declaration, Sony Music Group sent letters directly to OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google, the BBC reported—major players among more than 700 additiona unnamed AI companies—demanding they keep their hands off Sony content.“We support artists and songwriters taking the lead in embracing new technologies in support of their art,” Sony Music Group acknowledged. “Evolutions in technology have frequently shifted the course of creative industries. AI will likely continue that long-standing trend.”“However, that innovation must ensure that songwriters’ and recording artists’ rights, including copyrights, are respected,” it continued.The firm's declaration also asked AI developers to disclose whether they previously used the work of Sony artists in model training, how they were accessed, and the number of copies made of each copyrighted track.Sony Music Group entities included in the declaration were Sony Music Publishing (SMP), Sony Music Entertainment (SME), and their subsidiaries. All entities “expressly prohibits and opts out of any text or data mining, web scraping or similar reproductions, extractions or uses” of “musical compositions, lyrics, audio recordings, audiovisual recordings, artwork, images, [and] data... for any purposes, including in relation to training, developing or commercializing any AI system.”Sony, OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.Sony artists are popular targets of AI music enthusiasts who use their work—ingested by AI—to create similar-sounding songs, including AC/DC, Michael Jackson, Celine Dion, Adele, and Travis Scott. AI-generated knockoffs are rife on YouTube, and several AI music platforms explicitly feature specific artists that can be emulated.As Sony noted in its declaration, however, some of its artists have dabbled in the technology directly, including Billy Joel for his single “Turn the Lights Back On,” Jazz drummer Nate Smith, and songwriters for Doja Cat and the Jonas Brothers.“We will see a musician come along who finds some bridge between what AI can do and what people can do, and that person will create something that we all emulate,” Smith told New Jersey based WBGO last summer.For Jessica Agombar, the songwriter of “What a Man Gotta Do” by the Jonas Brothers, using AI is about using a tool, and is not a replacement for rough drafts in the creative process."For me, there's always art in organic songwriting and producing, putting your own vocals on the record, and having some rough sketches of bad notes and bum notes," Agombar told the BBC in October. "Because that's rock and roll—I'm more for that than the whole clean, polished AI, computerized thing."In April, Sony Entertainment, Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group, and Disney Music Group joined the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) in signing an agreement that limits how record labels can use performers' voices."If the companies are going to be using any kind of AI tool for digital voice replication, they will have to secure the written consent of the artist to do that,” union executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland previously told Decrypt. “Not only will it have to secure that, but it will have to be in a separate writing and can't be part of the royalty agreement or the main performer contract.”That same month, a group of artists including, Billie Eilish, Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj, Pearl Jam, Jon Bon Jovi, the Jonas Brothers, Peter Frampton, Billy Porter, Zayn Malik, Darius Rucker, Imagine Dragons, and Greta Van Fleet, joined with the Artist Rights Alliance in signing an open letter to demand a stop to unauthorized use of their voices.During a session of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, British actor and musician FKA Twigs—whose real name is Tahliah Debrett Barnett—spoke first-hand about how AI could affect artists.“What it boils down to is my spirit, my art—my brand is my brand,” she said. “I've spent years developing it, and it's mine... it doesn't belong to anybody else for it to be used in a commercial sense or cultural sense, or even just for a laugh.”“I am me, I am a human being," she continued. "And we have to protect that."Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

US Senate Revokes SEC Rule on Banning Banks' Crypto Holdings | Cryptopolitan

The U.S. Senate has decisively overturned a rule by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that restricted financial institutions from engaging in cryptocurrency-related activities. This rule had mandated that banks reflect customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets, backed by corresponding capital — a policy criticized for stifling innovation.Senate Votes Overwhelmingly Against SEC’s RuleIn a major decision on May 16, the Senate voted 60 to 38 to pass H.J.Res. 109, a resolution that nullifies the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121. This decision reflects a strong disapproval across party lines and highlights a broader legislative push against overregulation.Related: RIPPLE SEEKS TO SHIELD DOCUMENTS AMID SEC BATTLEThe Blockchain Association hailed this as a momentous stance against what is seen as an impediment to financial innovation.The relationship between the crypto market and the SEC has been fraught with tension, characterized by persistent legal battles and a regulatory approach that the industry perceives as overly aggressive. This latest legislative action is a critical change, with the Senate taking a clear position against one of the SEC’s most controversial regulations.Bipartisan Support Faced Presidential Veto ThreatThe resolution received bipartisan support in the Senate, which is currently under a narrow Democratic majority. However, the backdrop to this legislative victory includes President Joe Biden’s warning of a potential veto.On May 8, prior to the resolution’s passage in the House, President Biden expressed concerns about protecting investors and the broader financial system. His veto could send the bill back to Congress, where it would need a two-thirds majority to override his decision.Also Read: U.S. HOUSE TO VOTE ON MAJOR CRYPTO REGULATION BILL NEXT WEEK“It is clear there is overwhelming opposition to SAB 121, and I urge President Biden to reconsider his previous statement of intent to veto the resolution.”Rep. Mike FloodThis legislative move has also sparked discussions about the general implications for crypto regulation. The vote hints at possible shifts in how the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission might regulate digital assets in the future.Notably, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, which aims to clarify these regulatory roles, is slated for discussion in the House soon.Public Sentiment on Crypto is BadThe Blockchain Association pointed out the growing public interest in crypto, especially among younger voters, suggesting that this demographic shift could influence future political campaigns. A DCG poll indicates that nearly half of swing state voters distrust political figures who oppose crypto initiatives.Senator Cynthia Lummis emphasized that this was the first session of Congress to pass standalone crypto legislation, marking a historic moment for the Senate. Meanwhile, Representative Mike Flood, who sponsored the resolution, urged President Biden to reconsider his stance given the strong opposition to the SEC’s rule among lawmakers.This decision could also set the stage for upcoming debates on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, further reshaping crypto regulation.

Durham Police Chief Peter Moreira was quoted in the press as saying:“This investigation was extremely thorough, with more than 40 court orders sought and meticulous analysis of financial documents that took more than 18 months.”An investor had sued them for fraud three months earlier. Pleterski and his company were declared bankrupt in August of that year, and the bankruptcy trustee found that Pleterski had raised C$41.5 million and invested 1.6% of that sum. He spent C$15.9 million on personal perks, including a Lamborghini, two McLarens and two BMW automobiles, and rentals of a mansion and private jets.Source: Danny  DopePleterski continued to lead a jet-set lifestyle in spite of his bankruptcy and the trustee’s requests that he be jailed. He claimed he was kidnapped and tortured by an investor and his accomplices in December 2022, leading to five arrests by police in Toronto in July 2023.

FTX's massive payout plan can impact Bitcoin's price THIS way - AMBCrypto



FTX has announced a plan to repay creditors up to $16.3 billion
Analysts believe repayments could balance market dynamics, leading to a bullish 2nd half in 2024

FTX, the crypto-exchange that filed for bankruptcy last year, has announced a significant plan to repay its creditors, potentially injecting new momentum into the crypto-market. On 8 May, it was disclosed that the exchange could repay approximately 98% of its creditors, which could amount to as much as $16.3 billion. 
Those holding claim amounts below $50,000 are eligible for up to 118% recovery, based on November 2022’s cryptocurrency prices. This move has been welcomed by the market, with CEO Ray noting, 
“We are pleased to be in a position to propose a Chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors.”
The repayment plan by FTX is expected to have significant ripple effects across the crypto-market. This was the subject of K33 Research’s latest report, authored by analysts Vetle Lunde and Anders Hesleth.
According to the same, the cash payouts from FTX are likely to create a “bullish overhang” for the market, potentially leading to increased buying pressure.
Analysts weigh In: FTX repayments vs. market dynamics
K33 Research’s analysts believe that not all creditor repayments have a bearish impact. In their view, cash-based repayments by FTX will be contrary to the crypto-based repayments planned by other entities like Mt. Gox and Gemini, which are valued at a combined $10.6 billion. 

They argue that the buying pressure from cash recipients of FTX could neutralize the selling pressure from those receiving crypto payouts. “Not all creditor repayments are bearish,” they emphasized, suggesting that the overall effect could be more balanced than initially anticipated.
However, the exact influence of these repayments on the market is challenging to predict in advance. Ergo, the timing of these payments will be crucial in assessing their full impact. 
While Gemini’s $1.7 billion repayment is expected in early June and Mt. Gox’s $8.9 billion by October 2024, the FTX repayment schedule is still under court review, with most creditors anticipating disbursements later this year.
“The different timing of these repayments represents yet another indication of a slow summer in the market and a solid end to the year.” 
Market trends and future outlook
Meanwhile, the global crypto-market has shown strong bullish signs recently, with Bitcoin and Ethereum breaking major resistance levels. Over the last 24 hours alone, the market has surged by 5.8%, adding over $100 billion to the global crypto-market cap. 
This uptick has led to significant short trader liquidations. In the aforementioned period, 58,875 traders were liquidated, totaling $159.13 million in liquidations. This wave of liquidations follows a recent trend where ETH and PEPE contributed to $50 million in short trader losses.

Moreover, the hike in Bitcoin’s open interest, up nearly 10% in the last 24 hours, indicates rising capital inflow into the market. This is also a sign of investors being increasingly confident about the market’s direction.

Major Success For Chainlink: US Banks' Pilot Program Propels LINK Price Up 6%, Details


																The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has partnered with blockchain oracle Chainlink and several prominent banking institutions in the United States to conduct a successful pilot aimed at accelerating the tokenization of funds. 
The collaboration has not only paved the way for the adoption of blockchain technology in the traditional asset management sector but has also had a significant impact on the price of Chainlink’s native cryptocurrency, LINK, which has surged past the $14 threshold.
Major Asset Managers Join DTCC And Chainlink
The pilot, called Smart NAV, was developed by DTCC to explore the extension of its Mutual Fund Profile Service I (MFPS I), an industry-standard platform that transmits “Price and Rate” data, also known as “NAV data.” 

	Related Reading



By leveraging Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability and blockchain abstraction capabilities, the pilot aimed to investigate the potential of on-chain price and rate data as a key enabler for new initiatives, particularly in the realm of mutual fund tokenization.
To evaluate the industry value of a DLT-based price and rate dissemination solution, DTCC collaborated with asset managers, service providers, and distributors, including American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust, and State Street. 
On-Chain Data Delivery For Fund Tokenization
According to the announcement, the results of the pilot were positive. The collaboration between DTCC, the US banking institutions, and Chainlink reportedly showed that structured data can be delivered on-chain, enabling the embedding of foundational data into multiple on-chain use cases. 
This capability has far-reaching implications, including supporting brokerage portfolio applications and facilitating real-time, automated data dissemination. Moreover, Smart NAV aims to provide built-in access to historical data and simplify the relay of price and rate data through new interfaces for data consumption.
Furthermore, the pilot reportedly achieved several key milestones, including validating user interfaces and applications that leverage on-chain data, establishing automation of data routing through smart contracts for dynamic data management, and preventing future fragmentation through Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). 

	Related Reading



Ultimately, the DTCC stated that the partnership with Chainlink has played a key role in the success of the Smart NAV use case. By providing an abstraction layer through its cross-chain interoperability capabilities, Chainlink has facilitated “seamless” transmission of data across multiple blockchains. 
This approach eliminates the need for DTCC to establish individual connections to each blockchain, mitigating costs and operational complexities while ensuring data accessibility and optimization.
Bullish Momentum For LINK 
As of the time of this press release, the LINK token has successfully surged above the $14.88 mark, experiencing a notable 6.8% increase in price since the initial announcement on Thursday. 
Data from CoinGecko indicates that the token’s trading volume has also seen a significant surge of 17% in the last hours, reaching a substantial figure of $400 million.

However, for LINK to recover from its 72% losses from its all-time high of $52.70 reached in May 2021, it faces two key resistance levels as shown on the token’s daily LINK/USD chart above. 
These resistance walls are located at $15.18 and $17.8 respectively, before potentially moving towards the $20 mark. It remains to be seen whether the current bullish momentum will persist and further propel the price of LINK beyond these levels.

$9,100 Drained From US Veteran's Bank Account - Bank Rejects Responsibility, Demands Victim Pay $2,800 Negative Balance: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A customer at a US bank says $9,100 was mysteriously drained from his account even after he notified the lender about suspicious activity.
Military veteran Roberto Rangel says USAA then refused to reimburse his account – and demanded he pay a negative balance of $2,800 that was triggered by the theft, reports the Fox-affiliated news station KABB.










Rangel reportedly sold some of his prized possessions to pay the balance and maintain his credit score.
After the theft, which happened in December, Rangel says he spent months contacting USAA to get his retirement savings back, to no avail.
“I’m a 100% disabled veteran. I just can’t get up and go to work… I’ve spent a lot of time trying to get them to give me an answer.
It’s very stressful. You get the the point where you don’t know what to do.”
Rangel’s last move was to contact local news outlets.
Once KABB’s news team contacted the bank about Rangel’s case, the lender took another look, returned the money and released a statement.
“At times, based on the facts, we conclude we need to stand by our initial findings. If we find a mistake has been made, we’re committed to resolving the issue for our members.”
KABB says it has spoken to more than a dozen people with similar stories about USAA. The San Antonio-based lender has more than $2.569 billion in assets and more than 13 million members.

OpenAI Will Mix ‘Authentic’ Reddit Content Into Its AI Training Data - Decrypt

OpenAI will train its AI model on content from social discussion platform Reddit, the two companies jointly announced on Thursday. Reddit declared itself “an important space for conversation on the internet,” and said the agreement will expand the range of material in OpenAI's large language model (LLM) while helping it enhance its user experience.“This partnership will also enable Reddit to bring new AI-powered features to redditors and mods,” the company explained, while OpenAI will “better understand and showcase Reddit content, especially on recent topics.”Following the announcement, shares in Reddit (RDDT) briefly spiked more than 14% in after-hours trading. Shares in the company started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 21.In a footnote at the end of its blog post about the deal, OpenAI noted that its CEO Sam Altman is a shareholder in Reddit. The AI giant also noted that the agreement was spearheaded by Brad Lightcap, OpenAI chief operating officer, and approved by its independent board of directors.“Reddit has become one of the internet’s largest open archives of authentic, relevant, and always up-to-date human conversations about anything and everything,” Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman said in a statement. “Including it in ChatGPT upholds our belief in a connected internet, helps people find more of what they’re looking for, and helps new audiences find community on Reddit.”According to Reddit, OpenAI will pull Reddit content into ChatGPT and other unnamed products using Reddit's Data API. The partnership will also allow Reddit to develop new AI features using OpenAI's technology and meanwhile make OpenAI a Reddit advertising partner."We are thrilled to partner with Reddit to enhance ChatGPT with uniquely timely and relevant information, and to explore the possibilities to enrich the Reddit experience with AI-powered features,” Lightcap said in a statement.OpenAI declined further on the partnership. Reddit did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.The deal between OpenAI and Reddit comes the same week that both OpenAI and Google made several high profile announcements surrounding their respective AI tools.On Monday, OpenAI released updates to ChatGPT, including a new, faster model called GPT-4o. On Tuesday, during the annual Google I/O event, Google highlighted several new AI-powered features under its Gemini brand, including expanded features for its suite of workplace tools.The OpenAI deal is not the first one in which Reddit leveraged its extensive library of discussion and debate. In February, Reddit inked a deal with rival AI developer Google, giving the tech giant access to its extensive library of content. The partnership subsequently triggered an investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Reddit disclosed the following month."The FTC's staff is conducting a non-public inquiry focused on our sale, licensing, or sharing of user-generated content with third parties to train AI models," Reddit stated in the filing. “We do not believe that we have engaged in any unfair or deceptive trade practice.”News of the deal between OpenAI and Reddit did not sit well with many on social media, many commenters critical of the more provocative and controversial communities on the site.“The hivemind of Reddit are a bunch of basement-dwelling, unemployed socialists,” Trustswap CEO Jeff Kirdeikis wrote on Twitter. “If you thought [OpenAI] was biased before…”“Glad to know that search is coming with a Reddit filter,” Technology educator Paul Couvert said."Misinformation and bias galore,” writer and Entrepreneur Che Rodney said. “This is a disaster waiting to happen.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Crypto Staking Yields Tumble for ETH, ADA, SOL and More Despite $1 Trillion Market Boom | Cryptoglobe


                                
The revenue cryptocurrency users can get for staking some of the most popular digital assets has dropping significantly over the past year, with the yield earned for staking Ethereum ($ETH), for example, plunging from over 5% to around 3.18% at the time of writing.



That’s according to data from CCData shared with CryptoGlobe, which shows that this past year those staking major cryptocurrencies to earn yield on their holdings have seen that yield diminish significantly. Those staking Cardano (ADA), for example, saw yields drop from 3.35% in May 2023 to 3.07% as of May 16, 2024.



Polkadot (DOT), a cryptocurrency often referred to as the blockchain of blockchains, saw staking yields plunge from little over 22% to 18.64% – the largest total decline among the cryptocurrencies tracked – while Avalanche (AVAX) saw yields drop from 7.05% in May 2023 to 6.42% at the time of writing.



The staking yield that has seemingly managed to remain stable was that of Ethereum rival Solana (SOL), moving from around 7.5% in May 2023 to nearly 7.7% at the time of writing.

Staking, it’s worth noting, is a way for cryptocurrency holders to participate in a network’s Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism and earn rewards while doing so. Staked tokens are often locked while earning rewards, although there are various liquid staking services that allow token holders to receive a liquid derivative token when locking their tokens to stake.



Some staking services – such as those often offered by centralized cryptocurrency exchanges – may incur fees on the staking earnings in exchange for the service, effectively reducing the yields stakers receive through these platforms.



Staking yields dropped over the past year, while the cryptocurrency market added over $1 trillion amid significantly rally that saw the price of Bitcoin reach a new all-time high above $73,500 before enduring a correction and now trade at $65,200.

Bybit's Notcoin listing debacle, China firm's profits up 1100% after crypto buy: Asia Express - Cointelegraph Magazine


            
Our weekly roundup of news from East Asia curates the industry’s most important developments.



Bybit’s open-day Notcoin woes



Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit hasbeenembroiledin controversyover the initial listing of Notcoin (NOT), a play-to-earn game and token integrated as a Telegram Mini App and built on The Open Network.



Essentially, not all users received their airdrop before the market opened, leaving them at a disadvantage to those who had. The trading price was subsequently much lower than some other exchanges. 



“Bybit team is working very hard to solve the Notcoin airdrop balance reflection issue,” wrote CEO Ben Zhou in an X post on May 16 in the hours before trading commenced, continuing:




“Our wallet received around 370k on-chain transactions from @thenotcoin; only Bybit airdropis sentthis way; it will normally take quite a long timeto be ableto catch up all balances and reflect. We are trying manual credits for all users before the market opens in 1 hour; please stay tuned. All hands on deck. We are trying as hard as we could to get the notcoin into your account before market opens.”




Zhou further stated that the exchange will formulate a compensation plan for all 320,000 users affected by abnormal Notcoin account balances on the day of a debut. He claimed 70% of eligible users had been credited before the market opened.  “Sorry to let you all down. We will make sureto never let it happen again,” the CEO added.



Not all users were happy. 



“Binance and Bitget listed [NOT] at 0.01 while Bybit listed at 0.0007,” one user wrote. “That is why they are talking about compensation to silence people,” they alleged. 



Data from Binance and Bitget showsthat Notcoin explained volatile trading action after its debut with a day low of $0.000779 apiece and a high of $0.035.However, the same asset on Bybit only shows a peakhighof $0.01.



Notcoin’s wild trading day on Bybit. 



On May 10, Cointelegraph reported that Bybit announced upcoming Notcoin trading and withdrawals for its users.Launched in January 2024 without a coin as the name suggests, Notcoin is a free play-to-earn game on Telegram where users can earn rewards in the eponymous Notcoin token by tapping coin icons. The token currently has a fully diluted market cap of $818 million.






Is Hong Kong a crypto hub yet?



In an interview with Hong Kong media, crypto exchange OSL’s chief financial officer Davin Wu said that the city was a “testing ground for digital assets” in China and that “more innovative products” are set to be launched following the debut of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on April 30.



“Today, it is still in a very preliminary stage, just a starting point for this [crypto] industry,” said Wu.




 “In the future, there may also be margin trading, or some derivatives, options, futures, etc. linked to digital assets [in Hong Kong].”




Last month, the East Asian city became the first in the world to offer both spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. The city also has a Cyberport initiative that attracted 150 Web3 and AI firms to settle in 2023. 



The hype has not been matched by the reality of inflows. 



Prior tolaunch, Hong Kong crypto ETFs attracted around $293 million in seed assets under management.Since then net trading outflows for the six spot crypto ETFs have amounted to $29.9 million, under performing on a relative basis the huge haul of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in the months after their release.



But there are still signs of hope for a turnaround.



According to a survey by KPMG Advisory and Aspen Digital, 92% of Hong Kong respondents are interested in digital assets, while 54% are looking to expand digital assets to 5% to 30% of their investment holdings. 



“In recent years, some mainstream institutional investors have also joined the ranks of investing in virtual assets, which has enhanced the confidence of family offices and high-net-worth individuals,” the survey authors wrote.

China’s crackdown on crypto MLMs



Chinese police continue to crack down on the use of cryptocurrencies, taking aim at the promoters of dubious or illegal crypto schemes.



Recently, the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee said that it would apprehend suspects engaged in any form of multi-level marketing (MLM) activities promoting “blockchain, metaverse, digital asset trading, Bitcoin mining, and forex trading” activities. 



“In view ofthe new characteristics and new trends of MLM activities, especially online MLM, we will proactively issue warnings to the society, improve the public’s awareness and ability to prevent MLM, and create a strong social atmosphere to combat MLM,” law enforcement wrote.



Last year, Kunming police busted a $39 million Bitcoin mining MLM scam where markets promised returns of “2% to 30%” to recruiters who lured victims into the alleged Ponzi scheme. Curiously, Kunming is the city where Zhaojun, the CEO of blockchain bridging protocol Multichain, is allegedly being detained and has not been heard from since last July when the billion-dollar DeFi protocol collapsed as a result of his arrest.



On May 16, Chinese police busted a $1.9 billion underground banking firm where the perpetrators allegedly used the Tether stablecoin in a scheme to exchange the Chinese Yuan for foreign currencies, thereby bypassing the country’s strict forex controls. The Chengdu City Police issued a media report highlighting the details of the underground operations and said it had arrested 193 suspects across 26 provinces.

Chinese gaming firm rakes in 1,100% profit after investing in crypto. 



Chinese online gaming company Boyaa Interactive, with its shares listed in Hong Kong, anticipates that its profits for Q1 2024 will soar by 1,125% compared to just $3.98 million in the same quarter last year due to unrealizedprofitson its Bitcoin and Ethereum investments.During the same period, its core gaming business onlybrought in increased revenues of10% to 15%, suggesting putting crypto on your balance sheet can be a wise move in some circumstances.



Last December, Cointelegraph reported that Boyaa Interactive purchased $100 million in Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD Coin, and Tether for addition to its corporate treasury. Boyaa stated at the time: 




“The Internet gaming business mainly operated by the Group has a high degree of logical fit with Web3 technology. It attaches great importance to communities and users, covers virtual asset attributes and other characteristics, making Web3 technology easier and more widely used in the Internet gaming industry.”




Since then, the firm’s stock has tripled in value, and Boyaa plans to purchase an additional $100 million in cryptocurrencies to up its stake in its initial investment. In its March update, the company disclosed that it holds 1,110 Bitcoin with an average unit price of approximately $41,790, a total of 14,855 Ether with an average unit price of approximately $2,777, and approximately 8,000,000 units of USDT.

Avalanche Rising: Will The Wine Capital Fund Turbocharge Gains Above $40?


																AVAX, the native currency of Avalanche, a high throughput blockchain, is rising, adding an impressive 9% from May 15 lows. Buyers are taking over after weeks of lower lows. While the expansion of Bitcoin prices could explain these gains, there could be more.
Fine Wine Investment Fund Tokenized On Avalanche
Avalanche has announced tokenizing a fine wine investment fund, a move that would see the platform ride on the wave of tokenization. In a statement, Avalanche said the Wine Capital Fund has been tokenized by Oasis Pro and listed on ATS via the Avalanche C-Chain, where smart contracts are deployed.

The ATS is Oasis Pro’s trading platform registered by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Meanwhile, the capital fund is a “closed-end investment vehicle.” Specifically, it specializes in fine wines and is overseen by WIVX Asset Management. 
The decision to tokenize on Avalanche is a step forward in creating a tokenized asset ecosystem, mirroring progress made in Ethereum, among other chains. 
By making inroads into the fine wines market, estimated to be worth over $400 billion, the platform aims to democratize access, making it available to more investors. Analysts claim tokenization removes barriers common in traditional finance. Notably, Avalanche will play a huge role since the network is scalable, boosting a high throughput with sub-second finality.

The number of real-world assets (RWA) being onboarded is rising. When writing, data from RWA.xyz reveals that over $7.6 billion worth of private credit has been tokenized. At the same time, months after announcing the deployment of the BUIDL fund on Ethereum, it manages over $381 million of tokenized United States treasuries.
Efforts On Meme Coins, DeFi: Will AVAX Break $40?
Avalanche is not only making progress in tokenization; earlier, they announced efforts to encourage meme coin activity on-chain. To do this, the Avalanche Foundation launched Memecoin Rush, a $1 million liquidity mining incentive program.

As of mid-May 2024, DeFiLlama data shows that Avalanche DeFi protocols manage over $945 million. The number has shrunk by over 90% since November 2021, at over $10.9 billion.

DTCC, Chainlink complete fund data tokenization pilot with U.S. banks

The world’s largest settlement system, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), and blockchain oracle Chainlink have wrapped up a pilot program with several major banking firms in the United States aimed at increasing traditional finance fund tokenization.The Smart NAV Pilot program was conducted to standardize a method of providing net asset value (NAV) data of funds across blockchains, using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), according to a May 16 DTCC report.“The pilot found that by delivering structured data on-chain and creating standard roles and processes, foundational data could be embedded into a multitude of on-chain use cases, such as tokenized funds and ‘bulk consumer’ smart contracts, which are contracts that hold data for multiple funds,” it wrote.These capabilities could support future industry exploration as well as powering “numerous downstream use cases” like brokerage applications, more automated data dissemination, and easier access to historical data for funds, it said.The pilot helped establish better-automated data management, limited impact on existing market practices for traditional financial institutions, enabled clients to retrieve historical data without manual record keeping, and provided broader API solutions for price data, the DTCC’s report noted.Key NAV pilot takeaways.

Memecoin launcher pump.fun claims ex-employee behind $1.9M exploit

Solana memecoin creation tool pump.fun has claimed a former employee exploited the firm for nearly $2 million through a “bonding curve” attack.The ex-employee used their “privileged position” to access a “withdraw authority” and compromise the protocol’s internal systems, pump.fun alleged in a May 16 X post.About $1.9 million was stolen from the total $45 million held in pump.fun’s bonding curve contracts.The platform temporarily paused trading but it is now back up and running.The pump.fun smart contracts “are safe” and users impacted by the incident will receive “100% of the liquidity” that it previously had within the next 24 hours, pump.fun said.Source: pump.funPrior to pump.fun’s post, Igor Igamberdiev, the head of research at cryptocurrency market maker Wintermute, claimed the hack came about from an internal private key leak, which he suspected to be X user “STACCoverflow.”In a series of cryptic X posts, STACCoverflow claimed they were “about to change the course of history. n [sic] then rot in jail.” They added in a separate post they “do not care, I am already fully doxxed.”Related: Solana memecoin hits a whopping $328T market cap — for all the wrong reasonsIn an earlier X post, pump.fun said it has been collaborating with law enforcement.

Bitcoin Mining Crisis: The Bullish Signal You Can't Ignore


								On-chain data suggests the Bitcoin “Miner Price” metric has fallen under the BTC Electrical Cost. Here’s what happened next the last few times.
Bitcoin Miner Price Has Declined Below Electrical Cost For Fifth Time Ever
In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has pointed out a development that has recently occurred in the situation of the Bitcoin miners.
There are two relevant indicators here: Electrical Cost and Miner Price. The first measures the total daily cost that miners have to incur in electricity bills to mine 1 BTC.

The second one, the Miner Price, keeps track of the revenue that 1 BTC provides to the miners. This cohort earns their mining revenue through two modes: the block rewards and the transaction fees.
The former is paid out in BTC at a more or less constant rate, so its value is only dependent on the cryptocurrency’s price. As such, a single token from the block rewards would contribute a value equal to the current spot price to the miners’ total revenue.
The transaction fees don’t work so simply, as their value reflects the amount of traffic the network receives. The fees tend to stay low in times of little activity, as users don’t have much incentive to attach high amounts.
During periods of congestion, though, the network prioritizes only the high-fees transactions, as there is only a limited capacity to handle transfers. Thus, senders don’t have a choice of paying a low fee if they want their moves through in a reasonable amount of time.
Since the Miner Price considers the total revenue contributed by just 1 BTC, the transaction fees associated with 1 token would be required. Edwards’ metric has divided the total transaction fees by the total amount of BTC being mined.
This is because the transaction fees are only given out by the Bitcoin network alongside the block rewards when the miners add the next block to the chain (with this fee naturally being the amount the transactions contained within the block had paid out to the network).
Thus, this fee revenue could be assumed to be associated with the BTC amount given out in the block rewards alongside them (at present, this is 3.125 BTC). As such, the revenue associated with just one 1 BTC would be the ratio of the fees to this number.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Electrical Cost and Miner Price over the last decade:

The two metrics appear to have crossed in recent days | Source: @caprioleio on X
The graph shows that the Bitcoin Miner Price has recently declined under the Electrical Cost, meaning miners aren’t making enough revenue from 1 BTC to pay the electricity costs needed to mine it.
The analyst has highlighted the previous instances of this rare trend in the chart. The cryptocurrency’s price appears to have observed some sharp bullish momentum whenever the miners have been under such distress.

It now remains to be seen how Bitcoin will behave in the future, given that the asset has once again witnessed this trend.
BTC Price
Bitcoin had surged above the $66,000 level earlier, but the asset appears to have retraced some of this recovery as its price is now trading around $64,800.

Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) Explodes 700% Before Consolidating, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS), a Solana memecoin that was launched yesterday, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Diamond Paws presents a similar opportunity.



DIAPAWS rallied over 700% in the first few hours after its launch, before consolidating as some early buyers cashed out their profits.



However, most investors are still holding their tokens, as they are waiting for DIAPAWS to be listed on MEXC later this week, as this listing will cause the coin’s price to skyrocket.



Its current price presents a great opportunity for new investors to buy the dip before the next rally.



DIAPAWS has a market cap below $9,,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of around $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-3,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally another 12,000% in the coming two days, and Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, DIAPAWS can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for DIAPAWS by entering its contract address – HCEn3J1sKqMqPxrQDE33rGhJvyXh4r3YgyzD2wiAm3ga – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DIAPAWS.

$10,000 Ethereum (ETH) by Year-End? Analyst Makes Bold Price Prediction | Cryptoglobe


                                
Prominent cryptocurrency analysts have recently expressed bullish sentiment on Ethereum ($ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with one suggesting it will surge to over $10,000 by the end of the year.



Michaël van de Poppe, a cryptocurrency analyst with over 700,000 followers on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), expressed optimism, suggesting ETH is on track to reach a higher support level and added that the “good times are there in a few weeks time” after noting ETH is “at end stage of the correction.”







Ethereum is at the time of writing trading at $2,975 after losing around 2% of its value over the last 24-hour period and being flat over the past month, and while it significantly underperforms when compared to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC), which dropped 0.3% over the past 24 hours after moving up 8% over the last 30-day period. 



Nevertheless, another cryptocurrency analyst, CryptoYoddha, took an even bolder stance and suggested Ethereum is set to surge past the $10,000 before the end of the year.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

As reported, another popular analyst, Ali Martinez, has recently noted that the TD Sequential is presenting a “buy signal” on Ethereum’s daily chart and suggested the cryptocurrency could “see a rebound of one to four candlesticks” on its daily chart.



The TD Sequential indicator is a popular tool among traders and analysts for identifying potential buy or sell signals in the market. Developed by Tom DeMark, the indicator is designed to forecast the timing of price points where a trend could exhaust itself and reverse.



It does this through a series of numbers (sequentials) plotted on price charts, which are based on specific criteria related to the closing price of an asset over a set number of periods. When the indicator signals a “buy,” it implies that the asset’s price is likely to increase, making it an opportune time for investors to consider entering the market.

Alameda's Sam Trabucco Emerges To Defend FTX's Ryan Salame - DailyCoin


        

Alameda’s Sam Trabucco has resurfaced after nearly two years of radio silence.



The former Alameda chief has come out to defend an associate and former FTX executive.



The move has left crypto community members amused.




In November 2022, the house of cards that was Sam Bankman-Fried‘s crypto empire, comprising the crypto exchange FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research, came crashing down. In the months that followed, restructuring officers and prosecutors were left to unpack one of the most daring financial frauds in history, orchestrated by Bankman-Fried and his close circle of executives.



However, one key name has been missing from the indictments and court hearings that have followed the FTX and Alameda collapse: Sam Trabucco, who served as Alameda Research’s co-CEO until his curious departure from the firm and public life in August 2022.




After months of users asking, “Where is Sam Trabucco?” the now-reclusive former Alameda chief has made a shock cameo to vouch for Ryan Salame, a former associate who served as FTX Digital Markets co-CEO. In September 2023, Salame pled guilty to conspiracy to make unlawful political donations and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter business.



A Friendly Plea



With Salame set to be sentenced on May 28, friends and family have come to his defense in letters to the judge. Among the letters was one from Alameda’s Trabucco.



In the three-page letter dated May 6, 2024, the former Alameda chief described Salame in many words as hardworking, open, easy to work with, benevolent, a family man, a father, and ultimately his “best friend.”



Extolling these qualities, the now-reclusive Trabucco pleaded with the judge to look beyond the former FTX executive’s crimes and grant him a “fair” punishment.




"Ryan is my best friend. He has also committed crimes. He's acknowledged that and is prepared to accept the consequences. I want those consequences to be fair—not too light, not too excessive, but fair. Because, like anyone, Ryan doesn't deserve to be defined by his worst actions. He's a complex person who made mistakes, not some one-dimensional villain, and I know his punishment will reflect that," Trabucco's letter read.



While Trabucco had nothing but kind words for Salame, the crypto community was not as forgiving toward Trabucco.



“A Criminal Defending Another Criminal?”



Responding to the Trabucco letter, prominent crypto X account “Autism Capital” described it as “hilarious,” adding that it was  “a criminal defending another criminal.”







Another user asked, “WEN SAM TRABUCCO JAIL?”



These views come as many within the crypto community find it hard to believe that the executive who quit months before the FTX collapse was unaware of the years-long fraud perpetrated by Bankman-Fried and other executives, which largely involved the movement of FTX customer funds to Alameda. 



At the same time, Trabucco is also believed to have received a total of $25 million from working for Alameda, including a $2.5 million payment for a yacht named “Soak My Deck,” which could have been funded with FTX customer funds.



Despite being close to the FTX fraud and potentially benefiting from it, Trabucco has not been named in any of the lawsuits related to the FTX collapse, leading some to speculate that he was a confidential DOJ informant.



“No charges, no mention, and now writing references. People credit CZ with the FTX takedown, but Trab left well before that, and clearly went straight to the Feds,” Cinneamhain Ventures Partner Adam Cochran wrote.



On the Flipside 




Ryan Salame’s lawyers have requested a jail term of no more than 18 months.



Salame’s lawyers argue that he was kept in the dark about the fraud at the center of the FTX case.




Why This Matters 



Many in the crypto community believe that Sam Trabucco played a role in the FTX/Alameda collapse. However, the former Alameda chief has gone silent since resigning from the firm in August 2022. The recent letter in support of Salame represents the closest thing to a public statement from the executive following the FTX collapse.

Altcoins a ‘relatively huge’ risk as days of big returns are gone, say analysts

The high-risk, high-reward theory of altcoins might be tilting toward the former as big gains are now less likely due to weak narratives driving the crypto market, say crypto analysts.“While tactical opportunities exist, the era of 100x returns may well be behind us,” 10xResearch head of research Markus Thielen told Cointelegraph.He cautioned that despite the market anticipating an altcoin bull market this year, “retail participation remains subdued, and few new projects have emerged that captivate non-crypto-native traders.”Thielen said past altcoin bull markets had “distinct characteristics” that drew in more money, but this cycle has seen “tighter capital, evidenced by low total value locked and a dearth of venture capital investments.”“Last cycle, the narrative that crypto could supplant traditional financial systems was widely embraced, but this cycle’s narratives are shorter-lived and lack substantial backing,” Thielen added.Earlier this week, the Solana-based memecoin GameStop (GME) — no affiliation to the video game selling company — rose 2,727% alongside GameStop’s stock price spiking after trader Keith Gill posted a meme from his “Roaring Kitty” X account for the first time in nearly three years. GameStop briefly spiked 2,727% amid GameStop stock’s price rise. Source: CoinMarketCapMN trading consultancy founder Michael van de Poppe claimed in a May 16 X post that a portfolio mainly holding altcoins poses a “relatively huge” risk.“What’s the downside of this bet? It’s relatively huge. At the moment of posting, I’m down around 20% already in a matter of 1-2 weeks on the overall investment.”Despite the risk involved, van de Poppe explained he recently sold all his Bitcoin (BTC) to shift to altcoins, claiming he “can lose 50-80%.”However, crypto investor Fabio Andreatta is skeptical that there will even “be an altseason.”Related: Altcoins will bottom in early summer before bull run — Analyst“All you did is increase your risk,” Andreatta said responding to van de Poppe’s X post. “You are very unlikely to outperform Bitcoin. Most altcoins will never reach their ATHs ever again.” Bitcoin’s dominance — its market share relative to the rest of the crypto market — show the broader market has shifted capital away from altcoinsBitcoin dominance is nearing a year-to-date all-time high, currently at 56.05%, up 2.12% over the past 7 days, according to TradingView data.Magazine: Buy altcoins now, but sell before ‘mid-2025’: Charles Edwards, X Hall of FlameThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Absent Since FTX 2022 Downfall, Sam Trabucco Breaks Silence With Letter Of Endorsement | Bitcoinist.com


								In a recent development, Sam Trabucco, a key figure in Sam Bankman-Fried’s inner circle, has resurfaced after his absence from the public eye following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in late 2022. 
According to Bloomberg, Trabucco has come forward to support Ryan Salame, another former FTX executive who awaits sentencing for his involvement in the platform’s downfall.
Sam Trabucco’s First Communication Since FTX Bankruptcy
Trabucco’s endorsement of Salame was expressed in a letter describing Salame as the “funniest, most passionate, most supportive friend” he has ever had. The letter, made public as part of court filings on Wednesday, marks Trabucco’s first communication since the days leading up to FTX’s bankruptcy in November 2022.

Formerly serving as the co-chief executive of Alameda Research, a crypto fund established by Bankman-Fried, Trabucco played a crucial role in venture capital and market-making. However, in August 2022, three months before FTX’s failure, he abruptly stepped away from Alameda and retreated from public life.
Unlike other close associates of Bankman-Fried, such as Caroline Ellison, the other co-chief executive of Alameda, and FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, Trabucco did not participate in Bankman-Fried’s trial or contribute publicly available evidence. 
As Bitcoinist reported, Bankman-Fried received a 25-year prison sentence in March, while his former colleagues await their verdicts in the following months. Notably, Trabucco has not faced any public accusations of wrongdoing.
Diverse Group Rallies Behind Former FTX Executive
Trabucco has a long association with Bankman-Fried, having known each other since their early days at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) math camp. According to Bloomberg, he often shared how his poker strategy influenced Alameda’s trading decisions.
Prior to Alameda’s collapse, Trabucco allegedly received approximately $25 million in transfers from the firm. Moreover, Alameda spent $2.5 million to purchase a 52-foot yacht for Trabucco, which he affectionately named “Soak My Deck.” 
Ryan Salame, who formerly oversaw FTX’s digital assets unit in the Bahamas, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges related to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and engaging in campaign finance fraud. 

Several individuals, including a Georgetown finance professor, a martial arts grandmaster, family members, neighbors, former FTX employees, and Bahamian residents, have submitted letters in support of Salame.
As the legal proceedings progress, the emergence of Sam Trabucco and his endorsement of Ryan Salame sheds new light on the ongoing fallout from FTX’s collapse.

The Pulse of the Market - How Fear and Greed Shape Cryptocurrency Trading - The Daily Hodl


								
 
In the high-stakes world of cryptocurrency, market sentiment often swings wildly, driven by speculation and the whims of influential voices.
Unlike traditional financial markets, crypto values can skyrocket or plummet based on the collective mood of traders, making it essential to stay attuned to these emotional undercurrents.
Consider the sway of figures like Elon Musk and Michael Saylor – their tweets and public statements can send ripples through the market, causing dramatic shifts in value almost instantaneously.
For instance, Musk’s tweet about Bitcoin’s environmental impact led to a swift sell-off, underscoring how susceptible crypto prices are to influential opinions.
These events highlight the importance of understanding market sentiment to navigate the crypto landscape effectively.
Given this volatile environment, tools that measure market sentiment are invaluable.
Enter the Fear and Greed Index – a barometer that captures the emotional state of the market.
By interpreting this index, traders can gain insights into the underlying mood driving price movements and feel the pulse of the market for more informed decisions.
Source: Elon Musk/X
The Fear and Greed Index compiles various indicators such as market volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, surveys, Bitcoin dominance and Google Trends data.
It scores sentiment on a scale from zero (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed).
This scale provides a snapshot of market emotions, helping traders identify potential buying or selling opportunities.
When fear and greed dominate
When the market is gripped by fear, indicated by a low score, investors often sell off assets, fearing further losses.
This can lead to undervaluation, presenting potential buying opportunities for traders who recognize the overreaction.
Conversely, when the market is driven by greed, reflected in a high score, investors may become overly optimistic, driving prices up to unsustainable levels.
This often signals a good time to take profits or prepare for a potential correction.
Experienced traders use the Fear and Greed Index as a contrarian indicator. Extreme fear might suggest it’s time to buy, while extreme greed could indicate it’s time to sell.
By aligning trading strategies with these emotional extremes, investors can better navigate the unpredictable waters of cryptocurrency trading.
Current market sentiment
Today, the Fear and Greed Index stands at 70, indicating a strong tilt towards greed. Historically, such high levels of greed have preceded market corrections.
For seasoned traders, this suggests caution. It might be wise to secure profits and reevaluate risk exposure while remaining vigilant for signs of a market shift.
The Fear and Greed Index offers a powerful lens to view market emotions, enabling traders to anticipate and react to shifts more strategically.
By blending sentiment analysis with traditional market indicators, investors can gain a more holistic view of the market, enhancing their ability to make well-informed decisions in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading.
Understanding the interplay of fear and greed not only aids in navigating the present market landscape but also provides a strategic edge, helping traders stay one step ahead in the volatile journey of cryptocurrency investments.

Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian Highlights Democrats, Including Chuck Schumer, Who Crossed Party Line To Support Pro-Crypto Law - Benzinga

A known blockchain advocate, Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of social media platform Reddit Inc. RDDT, highlighted the Democrats who crossed party lines to support a pro-crypto legislation in the Senate Thursday.What Happened: The U.S. Senate joined the House of Representatives in repealing a controversial SEC directive that would prevent highly regulated financial firms from custodying Bitcoin BTC/USD. The legislation was passed by a 2/3rd majority vote.Interestingly, a dozen Democrats defied the party's hardening anti-crypto stance in supporting the resolution.Apart from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D), Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D), Gary Peters (D), Bob Casey (D), Jacky Rosen (D), Jon Tester (D), John Hickenlooper (D), Mark Kelly (D), Cory Booker (D), Ben Ray Luján (D), Ron Wyden (D), and Michael Bennet (D) voted in favor.Ohanian amplified a post from global cryptocurrency advocacy firm Bankless thanking the 12 Democrats, and pledging his support for the cause of cryptocurrencies in the country.Why It Matters: Ohanian has used public forums to extend his support for cryptocurrencies, even comparing the King Crypto with gold. Ohanian also took an early gamble with Ethereum ETH/USD, grabbing 50,000 of them during the asset's presale in 2014.As far as Reddit was concerned, the social media giant allocated a part of its excess cash reserves in Bitcoin and Ether. It also purchased Ether and Polygon MATIC/USD to use them to pay for virtual goods. The company's shares shot up 10% after the market on its new partnership with OpenAI, allowing Reddit users to use ChatGPT. Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $65,402.52, following a 0.8% pullback in the last 24 hours. Reddit shares were seen trading 11.05% higher in the after-hours session at $62.61 after closing 5.45% lower at $56.38 in regular trading, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Photo Courtesy: Asatur Yesayants on Shutterstock.comRead Next: Reddit Stock Pops On Partnership With OpenAI: The Details

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) to Skyrocket 14,000% Before KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GAMBCAT has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gambling Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gambling Cat could become the next viral memecoin.



Gambling Cat launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gambling Cat on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gambling Cat by entering its contract address – B4BQTfBJ6uQYkzaZyQjTmH7k3c9gzXQ3FrPMPDstpYAn – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAMBCAT.

Chainlink Fund Tokenization Pilot Successful With Large Banks Participating - Coincu



	

Key Points:




DTCC, in collaboration with Chainlink and major U.S. banks, completed a pilot to bring NAV data onto blockchains.



The Smart NAV project, which involved institutions like JPMorgan and BNY Mellon, used Chainlink’s CCIP to standardize data across blockchains.



The Chainlink fund tokenization underscores the growing interest in asset tokenization, boosting Chainlink’s price by 10% amid positive market trends.




The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest securities settlement system, has completed a successful pilot project with blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK) and several major U.S. financial institutions.





Chainlink Fund Tokenization Pilot Accomplished Through Partnership With DTCC



According to a report published by DTCC on Thursday, this initiative aims to accelerate the tokenization of funds.



The project, named Smart NAV, involved cooperation between DTCC, Chainlink, and prominent U.S. banks. It focused on testing a method to bring net asset value (NAV) data onto blockchains. Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) was crucial in facilitating standardized data provision across multiple blockchains, enhancing interoperability. 



Participating institutions included American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust, State Street, and U.S. Bank.




The primary goal of Smart NAV was to establish a standardized process for bringing and disseminating NAV data of funds across various blockchains. This standardization is intended to simplify and increase the efficiency of Chainlink fund tokenization. 



The pilot demonstrated that by delivering structured data on-chain and creating standardized roles and processes, foundational data can be embedded into various on-chain use cases, such as tokenized funds and smart contracts holding data for multiple funds.



Chainlink’s CCIP: Facilitating Interoperability in Financial Markets



DTCC’s report highlights that the Chainlink fund tokenization pilot successfully showcased the integration of structured NAV data onto blockchains, ensuring consistency and accuracy. Automated data routing via smart contracts was also established, promoting dynamic data management and preventing fragmentation through Chainlink’s CCIP. 



Clients now have the ability to consume price and rate data in real time through new interfaces, including APIs and smart contracts. These new data consumption methods facilitate instant updates and enable various applications, such as automated portfolio rebalancing.





The Chainlink fund tokenization pilot project takes place in a broader context where the tokenization of real assets (RWA) like bonds, funds, and other traditional investments is gaining interest. Financial giants such as BlackRock, Citi, and HSBC are exploring tokenization for benefits like operational efficiency, faster settlement, and increased transparency. Following this news and broader market optimism, Chainlink’s price surged by 10% in the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin remaining above $65,000.

Controversial SEC Crypto Asset Accounting Rule Strongly Opposed By US Senate - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The U.S. Senate voted 60-38 to overturn the SEC crypto asset accounting rule, easing restrictions on banks holding cryptocurrencies.



The legislation, passed by the House, could be vetoed by President Biden, who argues that it could harm investor protections.



The resolution, backed by both parties, seeks to enable regulated institutions to offer crypto custody services.




The U.S. Senate has passed a bill to overturn the SEC’s Notice 121 (SAB 121), which requires companies to record crypto assets on their balance sheets, making it costly for financial institutions to hold cryptocurrencies.





Senate Votes to Overturn SEC Crypto Asset Accounting Rule



The legislation passed with a 60-38 vote aims to reverse this rule, enabling banks to act as custodians for digital assets like Bitcoin. The House approved the bill last week, and it now awaits President Biden‘s decision.



SEC crypto asset accounting rule forces banks to label crypto assets held for clients as liabilities, which has deterred institutions from participating in crypto custody.



The Congressional resolution, H.J.Res. 109, seeks to eliminate these barriers, facilitating highly regulated firms to offer custody services for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Proponents argue this move is essential for consumer protection and to decentralize the custody of Bitcoin, which is currently concentrated among a few institutions.




Bipartisan Effort Aims to Ease Crypto Custody Restrictions



Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal supporter, sees the bill’s passage as a shift towards a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. She criticized the SEC crypto asset accounting rule as an administrative overreach, not properly sanctioned by the SEC‘s commissioners. Conversely, Senator Elizabeth Warren warned against the bill, citing the unique risks of digital assets, such as their susceptibility to hacking, as evidenced by breaches at exchanges like Binance and FTX.



The White House has indicated a potential veto, arguing that overturning the SEC crypto asset accounting rule would hinder the SEC’s ability to protect investors and the financial system. Despite this, the bill’s bipartisan support in Congress, with some Democrats joining the predominantly Republican effort, underscores the contentious nature of crypto regulation.

Crypto Just Had A Game-Changing Moment, But Will Biden Veto?


								In a potentially game-changing moment for the crypto sector, the US Senate has passed H.J. Res 109, a bill seeking to overturn the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121 om Thursday, May 16. The bill was passed with substantial bipartisan support, receiving a 60-38 vote in the Senate and earlier approval from the House.
SAB 121, implemented in 2022, mandated digital asset custodians to list digital assets as liabilities on their balance sheets, a requirement widely criticized within the crypto community. Critics argue that this regulation unfairly treats customer-owned digital assets as the custodian’s liabilities, thereby necessitating equivalent cash reserves to offset these “liabilities.”
Why Yesterday’s Vote Is A Game-Changer For Crypto
Avichal Garg, Co-Founder and General Partner at Electric Capital, expressed the industry’s frustration, stating, “If a bank custodies $1b of Bitcoin for customers, they have to hold $1b in cash to offset this ‘liability’ on their balance sheet. The assets are not the company’s. They are the customers’.” Garg also suggested that SAB 121 was designed to keep banks out of the crypto markets, which he sees as detrimental to consumer protection.

The Senate’s decision represents a critical juncture not only for crypto regulation but also for political alignments concerning financial technology. Notably, the vote saw 21 Democrats break ranks from their usual stance under the influence of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been a stringent advocate for strict financial and tech regulations. This shift suggests a significant political realignment, potentially indicative of a broader centrist move in the Democratic Party concerning market regulations.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s vote in favor of repealing SAB 121 carries considerable weight, signaling strong Congressional support for the cryptocurrency sector against the backdrop of President Biden’s veto threat.
Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, described the moment as transformative for the industry: “This is a game-changing moment for crypto. It’s one of the catalysts that will propel crypto to new all-time highs as the market digests the sea change that’s occurred here.”

Further highlighting the political drama, Perianne Boring, Founder and CEO of The Chamber of Digital Commerce, pointed out the potential influence of Senator Schumer in swaying the President’s decision: “If anyone can convince POTUS to sign, it’s Schumer. We have a very real chance of getting this across the finish line.”
Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at Variant Fund, also commented on the implications of the vote, stating, “The Senate just delivered a deafening bipartisan message in favor of common sense and against SEC overreach. It’s impossible to overstate the importance of Majority Leader Schumer voting to repeal SAB 121 over President Biden’s threatened veto.”
What Will President Biden Do?
The resolution now sits on President Biden’s desk, with the President having expressed intentions to veto it, aligning with Senator Warren and SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s views that the SEC’s guidelines are crucial for protecting investors in the volatile crypto markets. Eleanor Terrett of FOX Business highlighted the President’s dilemma, noting, “Biden now has 10 days to either veto, sign or do nothing. Doing nothing would mean it goes into law just without the signature.”
The crypto industry remains on edge as it awaits the President’s decision. A veto would maintain the status quo, potentially stifling further institutional participation in the crypto market due to perceived regulatory risks. Conversely, a decision to sign or allow the bill to pass without a signature could significantly liberalize the regulatory environment, encouraging more substantial institutional engagement and possibly catalyzing a new phase of market growth and innovation.
As the deadline approaches, the decision will not only determine the regulatory framework for digital asset custody but also signal the administration’s broader stance towards innovation and regulation in the fintech sector.
At press time, Bitcoin traded at $65,565.

FLOKI's 15 billion token burn - Here's what it means for investors like you - AMBCrypto



Market sentiment around FLOKI remained bullish as its Altrank hit #1
While FLOKI’s price dropped by 5% in the last 24 hours, indicators hinted at a trend reversal 

FLOKI broke above a bullish pattern a few days ago, which hinted at a sustained price rise. The latest datasets indicated that the memecoin was on the right track and was moving towards its targets. Meanwhile, a major proposal got passed, one that could fuel further growth on the charts. 
A lot is happening with FLOKI
World Of Chart, a popular crypto-analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting how FLOKI broke above a bull pattern. According to the same, FLOKI’s price entered a bullish symmetrical triangle pattern in March and successfully broke above it a few days ago. 
The breakout could result in a +100% hike in the memecoin’s price. The tweet also mentioned that FLOKI has been on the right track, with the altcoin appreciating by over 15% since the aforementioned breakout.
In the meantime, the memecoin announced that a major proposal had passed. As per its official X handle, FLOKI DAO has voted in favor of burning 15,246,000,000 FLOKI tokens, with a majority of 99.84% voting in favor of the burn. 
This deflationary characteristic might have a positive impact on FLOKI in the future since token burns affect circulating supply and in turn, they can push an asset’s price up. 
There is one concern
Though both of these aforementioned developments looked optimistic, things on the ground were a bit different. According to CoinMarketCap, the memecoin’s price declined by nearly 5% in just 24 hours. 
At the time of writing, the memecoin was trading at $0.0002121 with a market capitalization of over $2 billion. However, this trend might change soon. 
LunarCrush’s latest tweet revealed that FLOKI’s Altrank hit #1. For starters, Altrank is calculated by combining special and market activity and FLOKI’s metric hinted at a price uptick soon. 
To see whether that’s possible, AMBCrypto analyzed Santiment’s data. As per our analysis, despite the latest price drop, market sentiment around the memecoin remained positive, as is evidenced from its high weighted sentiment. Its MVRV ratio had a value of over 25% too – A bullish signal. 
However, the memecoin’s funding rate increased, which could cause trouble. Generally, prices move the other way than the funding rate.

Apart from the MVRV ratio and weighted sentiment, a few market indicators also looked optimistic. For instance, the Bollinger Bands suggested that FLOKI’s price was above its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Additionally, both its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered price hikes, indicating that the bearish market trend might change soon.

                        Binance has teamed up with Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau and the Taipei District Prosecutors Office to solve a significant case involving cryptocurrency-assisted money laundering.The investigation centered around illicit funds amounting to nearly NT$200 million, equivalent to approximately $6 million, the exchange said in a press release shared with CryptoNews.Per the announcement, Binance’s cooperation, leveraging its Financial Crimes Compliance (FCC) Department’s expertise and intelligence sharing, played a key role in bringing the perpetrators to justice.Money Laundering for a Long Period
The criminal operation had been facilitating money laundering for scam groups using virtual assets for an extended period.The perpetrators employed various tactics, including fabricating customer conversation records, remittance proofs, and falsified identity verification data, to create the illusion of legitimate transactions.However, their activities did not go unnoticed, and law enforcement authorities eventually caught up with them.The police traced and monitored several suspicious cryptocurrency transactions and sought relevant information from various parties, including Binance.“Upon receiving the request, Binance responded swiftly and set up a cross-border online meeting with the investigating officers and prosecutors to discuss the collaborative strategy,” the exchange wrote.“Binance’s experienced FCC teams provided insights and recommendations based on crypto flow analyses, thereby helping to narrow down the circle of potential suspects more effectively.”Prosecutor Lo Wei-Yuan from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, who oversaw the case, subsequently filed indictments against nine suspects on charges of aggravated fraud, violation of the Money Laundering Control Act, and breach of organized crime prevention regulations last month.Expressing gratitude for Binance’s cooperation, Prosecutor Lo Wei-Yuan said Binance has “active and ongoing collaboration with Taiwan’s law enforcement agencies.”Damien Ho, a representative of Binance’s Asia-Pacific (APAC) team, said Binance is committed to combatting financial crime and protecting the integrity of the Web3 ecosystem.“We will continue to uphold this goal and deepen our cooperation with global law enforcement agencies.”Binance Eyes Global Expansion
Last week, the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) revealed that Binance has successfully registered with the regulatory body, returning to the country after some regulatory hurdles. Prior to that, the exchange announced that it had obtained a license from Dubai’s regulator, VARA, enabling the platform to cater to retail clients along with qualified and institutional ones.According to Bloomberg, the licensing process involved Binance’s founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, relinquishing voting control of the Dubai unit.Furthermore, earlier this year, Binance unveiled its joint venture crypto exchange Binance Thailand, which comes in collaboration with Gulf Innova, a subsidiary of Gulf Energy Development.Binance Thailand, abbreviated as Binance TH, provides a platform for digital asset exchange services with Thai baht trading pairs.It is worth noting that Binance has faced increasing regulatory scrutiny worldwide.Last year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed charges against Binance for allegedly operating an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange and evading federal laws.Similarly, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Binance Holdings LTD and ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) for allegedly operating unregistered exchanges, broker exchanges, clearing houses, and the unregistered offer and sale of securities.

                        A customer sued Dolce & Gabbana USA on Thursday, claiming the NFTs they purchased lost 97% in value due to the company’s bungled delivery.Bloomberg reported Friday that the Italian fashion house sold the NFTs on Ethereum, promising “a slate of digital, physical and experiential benefits.” It reportedly told consumers that buying its DGFamily NFTs would unlock access to various digital rewards, physical products, and exclusive events.The lawsuit further alleges that Dolce & Gabbana failed to deliver the NFTs and promised benefits on time. The digital outfits, which arrived 20 days late, “could be used only in a metaverse platform with barely any users.”Dolce & Gabbana Allegedly Misled NFT Buyers with Unusable Digital Fashion
Even after the delayed arrival, token holders were allegedly left waiting another 11 days before they could use them. According to the complaint, Dolce & Gabbana hadn’t secured approval from the metaverse platform beforehand.“Their standard operating procedure has been to promise products they fail to deliver, before abandoning a project and community they promised to support,” the complaint said.Luke Brown, the plaintiff, claims he lost $5,800 on the NFTs he purchased. Brown said he is suing on behalf of others who bought digital assets from this NFT project. His lawsuit also targets NFT marketplace UNXD, making it a party to the legal action.NFT Market Growth Slows in 2024 
The NFT market has shown signs of growth so far in 2024. Estimates suggest a 41% increase in marketplace value compared to 2023. However, this is a significant slowdown compared to previous years’ explosive growth.Some high-profile sales like CryptoPunk 3100 did fetch $16m in March. But the overall trend points towards a decline in value for many NFTs.

Bitcoin Supply On Exchanges Is Falling To New Lows - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Bitcoin supply on exchanges reaches new lows amid bullish market sentiment, signaling a move towards long-term holding.



Data predicts Bitcoin reserves on exchanges may deplete within nine months due to factors like the recent halving and increased US ETF investments.



Concerns arise over the Federal Reserve’s hesitance to cut interest rates, potentially affecting Bitcoin’s short-term price outlook despite optimistic forecasts.




Bitcoin supply on exchanges has hit a new low amidst bullish market sentiments over the past 48 hours, according to data from HIVE Digital Technologies.





Bitcoin Supply on Exchanges Plummets Amidst Bullish Surge



The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $65,300, marking a notable recovery from just above $66,500 earlier this week.



This decline in Bitcoin supply on exchanges is seen as a positive sign by analysts, indicating a shift towards long-term holdings rather than short-term trading. A report by the crypto exchange Bybit predicted that Bitcoin supply on exchanges could be depleted within nine months, attributing this trend to factors such as Bitcoin halving and increased inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly from the United States.



Federal Reserve’s Stance Casts Shadow on Bitcoin’s Price Trajectory



The introduction of US exchange-traded funds investing in Bitcoin earlier in the year led to a surge in trading volume, but activity has since slowed amidst tightening financial conditions and uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve‘s approach to inflation. Despite market excitement surrounding the April 19 Bitcoin halving, which reduced the supply of new coins minted on the network, concerns linger about the Fed’s reluctance to initiate an interest rate cut cycle this year.




Analysts suggest that such cuts may be necessary to drive Bitcoin’s price to forecasted targets, such as $100,000 by 2024. However, with the Fed showing no signs of immediate action, the outlook for Bitcoin’s price trajectory remains uncertain in the short term.

‘Rocket Fuel for Bitcoin’: Analyst Jamie Coutts Says This Catalyst Could Propel BTC to $150,000 This Cycle - The Daily Hodl


								Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts is saying that the performance of the US dollar against other major currencies will impact the price of Bitcoin (BTC).
Coutts tells his 16,300 followers on the social media platform X that the US Dollar Index (DXY), a measure of the US dollar’s value compared to a basket of six dominant global currencies, is currently trading in a range.










According to Coutts, Bitcoin could rally if the DXY falls by around three percent from the current level.
“A break below 101 would be rocket fuel for Bitcoin.”
Source: Jamie Coutts/X
The DXY is trading at 104.52 at time of writing.
According to the Real Vision analyst, the DXY falling would send Bitcoin surging by approximately 127%.
“Risk assets love dollar weakness. 
The DXY holds the key to the Bitcoin cycle as it prices in market expectations on liquidity in real-time. And liquidity is coming.
Watch the 101/102 level on DXY. If that breaks, then we should see approximately $150,000 BTC this cycle.”
Source: Jamie Coutts/X
Earlier this month, Coutts opined on a reverse scenario warning that an upward move by the US dollar index would send Bitcoin to levels last recorded in February.
“With money supply actually expanding again, if the DXY turns bullish (i.e. weakens), then you have the macro/liquidity signal for BTC and it will be off to the races. 
However, 106/107 on the DXY remains the bogeyman level, which if broken, would likely see a fall into the low $50,000 range.”
Bitcoin is trading at $66,189 at time of writing.

                        The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the largest settlement system in the world, has partnered with blockchain oracle Chainlink to conclude a pilot program involving several major banking firms in the United States.The primary objective of the program was to enhance the tokenization of traditional finance funds.The pilot program, known as the Smart NAV Pilot, focused on establishing a standardized method for providing net asset value (NAV) data of funds on blockchains.Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) played a key role in achieving this goal.Structured Data Could be Delivered On-Chain
According to the DTCC’s report, the program demonstrated that structured data could be delivered on-chain, paving the way for various on-chain use cases such as tokenized funds and “bulk consumer” smart contracts, which hold data for multiple funds.The successful outcomes of the pilot program have implications for future industry exploration and enablement of numerous downstream use cases.These include brokerage applications, more automated data dissemination, and easier access to historical data for funds.The DTCC’s report noted that the program facilitated better-automated data management, minimal disruption to existing market practices in traditional financial institutions, retrieval of historical data without manual record-keeping, and broader API solutions for price data.Prominent US banking firms actively participated in the pilot program, including American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust, State Street, and U.S. Bank.Following the release of the DTCC’s report, Chainlink’s native token, LINK, experienced a 12.5% increase in value.Over the past 12 months, LINK has demonstrated significant growth, gaining more than 130% amid the broader uptick in the cryptocurrency market.Interest in RWA Tokenization on Rise
The DTCC’s report coincides with the growing enthusiasm among major traditional financial institutions for real-world asset tokenization.On March 19, BlackRock, a leading investment management firm, introduced a tokenized money market fund called BUIDL on the Ethereum network. The fund allows investors to acquire tokens representing shares in the fund, which primarily invests in assets such as U.S. Treasury bills.Operating as an ERC-20 token called BUIDL, the fund is often referred to as the “digital liquidity fund” due to its digitized nature on the Ethereum blockchain.As reported,  the TVL for RWA protocols soared to nearly $8 billion by the end of April.Some protocols have played a significant role in driving this growth, particularly in terms of active users.Digital carbon market platforms like Toucan and KlimaDAO, as well as the real estate tokenization protocol Propy, have experienced substantial user growth.Tokenized treasuries have also seen remarkable expansion as yields remain high in an environment of elevated inflation and interest rates in the United States.The RWA.xyz platform reported a record $1.29 billion locked-in tokenized U.S. treasuries and bonds, representing an 80% surge since the beginning of 2024. Back in March, DigiFT, a Singapore-based fintech company, also announced that it has made a foray into the digital asset realm with the launch of its US Treasury bill depository receipt (DR) tokens.

Did FED's Rate Cut Pushed Earlier After Positive Inflation Reports? WSJ Correspondent Clarified - Bitcoin Sistemi


Wall Street Journal reporter Nick Timiraos stated that the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the USA is not important enough to change the expectations regarding the FED's interest rate cut.
This leaves open-ended the possibility of a rate cut later this year. However, the analyst emphasized that two more CPI reports are needed to make a prediction in the form of an interest rate cut.


Despite forecasts, the Fed may not cut interest rates before September. Meanwhile, Americans continue to face significant price pressures, especially gasoline prices. Therefore, the economic landscape remains uncertain and all eyes will be on other upcoming CPI reports and the Fed's response.

New data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that prices rose 3.4 percent in April compared to the previous year. That's slightly lower than the 3.5 percent rate recorded in March, and the change comes after months of warmer-than-expected reports. Prices increased by 0.3 percent compared to the previous month.

Morgan Stanley Bets BIg on Crypto with $270 Million GBTC Stake


							

Financial giant Morgan Stanley’s investment through GBTC positions the bank as a major holder of Bitcoin.



Leading global banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and UBS, have also reported holdings in Bitcoin ETFs.



This growing acceptance suggests that cryptocurrencies are being viewed as a potential asset class by major financial institutions.




In a sign of growing mainstream adoption, financial giant Morgan Stanley revealed a hefty $269.9 million investment in Bitcoin through Grayscale’s GBTC trust, as disclosed in its first-quarter 13F filing. And as per CNBC, This positions the bank as a major holder of GBTC, trailing only Susquehanna International Group’s $1 billion stake.



Morgan Stanley’s move reflects a broader trend among leading global banks. The Royal Bank of Canada, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, and UBS have all disclosed similar investments in Bitcoin ETFs, underscoring institutional warming to the cryptocurrency.



The trend extends beyond traditional banks. Recent filings show significant exposure to Bitcoin ETFs by prominent investment firms. New York-based Pine Ridge Advisers holds a $205.8 million portfolio, including stakes in BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Bitwise’s BITB. Boothbay Fund Management, a hedge fund manager, boasts a diversified $377 million portfolio across the same Bitcoin ETFs.









Alternative asset managers are also joining the fray. Aristeia Capital revealed a $163.4 million position in IBIT, while Graham Capital Management holds a combined $102.6 million across IBIT and FBTC. Crcm LP, another hedge fund manager, reported a $96.6 million stake in IBIT.



While the long-term viability of Bitcoin remains a subject of debate, Morgan Stanley’s sizable investment and the increasing participation of other financial institutions suggest a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a potential asset class. This trend necessitates a close watch, as it could have significant implications for the future of finance.

Bitcoin vs inflation; Can Bitcoin hedge against inflation?


As traditional fiat currencies face the specter of inflation due to various economic factors, alternative assets like Bitcoin (BTC) have gained increasing attention as potential hedges against this phenomenon. But can Bitcoin hedge against inflation? In this article, we’ll delve into the dynamics of inflation, explore how Bitcoin operates in this context, and evaluate its effectiveness as a hedge against inflationary pressures.
What is inflation?
Before we dive into the role of Bitcoin, it’s essential to grasp the concept of inflation. Inflation refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, leading to a decrease in purchasing power over time. It’s typically measured as an annual percentage increase in the consumer price index (CPI) or the producer price index (PPI).
Inflation occurs due to various factors, including:




Monetary policy: Central banks control inflation through monetary policy tools such as interest rates and money supply. Increasing the money supply can lead to inflation as more money chases the same amount of goods and services;



Demand-pull inflation: When aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, prices tend to rise. This often occurs during periods of strong economic growth or excessive government spending;



Cost-push inflation: Rising production costs, such as wages or raw materials, can lead to increased prices for goods and services.

About Bitcoin (BTC)
Bitcoin homepage. Source: bitcoin.org
Often touted as digital gold, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a decentralized network using blockchain technology, which ensures transparency, security, and immutability of transactions.
Bitcoin’s proponents argue that its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it immune to inflationary pressures that plague traditional fiat currencies. Unlike government-issued currencies, BTC has a maximum supply cap of 21 million coins, making it inherently deflationary.
Bitcoin price today





As of May 17, 2024, the price of Bitcoin is over $65,621.

Can Bitcoin hedge against inflation?
To assess whether Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against inflation, let’s examine some of its key properties:


Limited supply: With only 21 million Bitcoins that will ever exist, Bitcoin’s supply is capped, making it immune to inflation caused by excessive money printing;



Decentralization: Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network of computers, making it resistant to government manipulation or interference, which can contribute to inflation;



Store of value: Proponents argue that Bitcoin’s digital scarcity and growing adoption make it a viable store of value similar to gold, which has a history as a hedge against inflation;



Volatility: Bitcoin’s price has been highly volatile, experiencing significant fluctuations over short periods. While some view this volatility as a barrier to its effectiveness as a hedge, others see it as a potential opportunity for gains during inflationary periods.

Bitcoin vs. traditional assets
To better understand Bitcoin’s potential as an inflation hedge, let’s compare it to traditional assets such as gold and government bonds:

Table 1: Comparison of Bitcoin and traditional assets



What is the inflation rate of gold vs Bitcoin?

The inflation rate of gold, determined by the annual increase in the above-ground gold supply through mining, typically ranges from 1.5% to 2%. In contrast, Bitcoin’s inflation rate is inherently controlled by its protocol through halving. Approximately every four years, the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks is halved, reducing the rate at which new BTCs are introduced into circulation.

Pros and cons of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge





Limited supply: Bitcoin’s capped supply protects it from inflationary pressures;

Decentralization: Its decentralized nature protects against government manipulation;

Potential for high returns: Bitcoin’s volatility can lead to significant gains during inflationary periods.






Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility may deter some investors seeking stability;

Regulatory uncertainty: Regulatory changes or government crackdowns could affect Bitcoin’s value;

Adoption challenges: Despite growing acceptance, Bitcoin still faces hurdles in mainstream adoption and acceptance as a hedge.



The bottom line: Can Bitcoin hedge against inflation?
While Bitcoin possesses several attributes that make it an attractive candidate for hedging against inflation, its effectiveness remains a subject of debate. While its limited supply and decentralized nature provide inherent protections against inflationary pressures, its volatility and regulatory uncertainties pose challenges.
Ultimately, whether Bitcoin can effectively hedge against inflation depends on various factors, including its adoption as a store of value, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions. As such, investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment objectives before allocating funds to Bitcoin or any other asset class.

This Crypto, Pumping 12% On New Asset Tokenization Milestone, Is 'An Opportunity Of A Lifetime,' Says Analyst - Benzinga

Popular cryptocurrency trader and analyst Michaël van de Poppe raised his bullish bets on Chainlink LINK/USD after the coin outperformed the broader market with double-digit gains. What Happened: Van de Poppe called LINK as the "opportunity of a lifetime" reacting to a notable development in the coin's ecosystem.Chainlink, the parent blockchain of the cryptocurrency, announced the successful completion of of pilot project in partnership with The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation and several of the top U.S. banks to bring capital markets on blockchain rails and boost the asset tokenizing economy.The pilot project tested how to disseminate mutual funds data to any private/public blockchain using Chainlink's interoperability feature.Price Action: Reacting to the development, LINK surged more than 12% in the last 24 hours, trading at $15.68 at the time of publication, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Notably, LINK's large transaction volume jumped 141% in the past 24 hours on this announcement, according to IntoTheBlock. Additionally, balances of long-term holders increased 0.26%, signaling an intent to accumulate the cryptocurrency. Why It Matters: For the curious, tokenization of real-world assets was emerging as the next big thing in blockchain technology, with the industry having $6.68 billion in total locked as of this writing, according to DeFiLlama.Think of it as simply the process of bringing off-chain assets like bonds, real estate, commodities, and much more onto blockchains,  resulting in a variety of options for both traditional and decentralized finance.Chainlink, acting as the bridge between off-chain and on-chain worlds, holds the key for narrative.Read Next: Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian Highlights Democrats, Including Chuck Schumer, Who Crossed Party Line To Support Pro-Crypto Law

Nuklai Partners with Peaq: Smart Data Solutions for DePINs - Coin Edition


							

On-chain smart data platform collaborates with peaq, layer blockchain infrastructure.
Nuklai addresses data availability, its effective use, and fair data monetization.
Secure and seamless flow of reliable data is the lifeblood of the entire IoT sector: CEO of Nuklai.




Nuklai, the world’s first on-chain smart data platform designed to transform data sharing and AI model training, declared a new collaboration with Peaq, a key layer-1 blockchain space for DePIN and Machine RWAs. DePINs connected to Peaq gain access to Nuklai’s smart data infrastructure, curated data sets, as well as tools for equitable data monetization.



The integration comes at a time of high demand, as shown by the exponential growth in IoT devices. The global device count, which reached 15.1 billion in 2023, is projected to increase to 19.08 billion by 2025, producing a massive 73.1 zettabytes of data annually. Yet, a Techreport survey reveals that 97% of companies struggle to extract actionable insights from this wealth of information, indicating a significant gap between data availability and its effective use.



Fair data monetization is another issue the union is designed to address. In April, Nuklai launched a significant collaboration with Farmsent, a global Web3 marketplace for farmers, which became the first use case of a DePIN on peaq to leverage this integration. 



According to Nuklai, farmers play a critical role as major data producers: DePPs collect a treasure trove of farmer data, from the farmer’s input into the food supply chain to weather impact data to product details. However, historically, they have seen their data collected and sold by IoT providers, often without receiving any benefits — an issue that stretches far beyond the agricultural sector.



Nuklai addresses both challenges by creating an on-chain smart data ecosystem, focused on optimizing the processes of sharing, requesting, evaluating, and monetizing data. By upgrading raw data into higher quality smart data and offering a wide array of data tools, Nuklai aims to enhance production efficiency and predictive data analytics across industries. 



Founder and CEO of Nuklai, Matthijs de Vries stated “Secure and seamless flow of reliable data is the lifeblood of the entire IoT sector. This is why I’m excited that Nuklai’s smart data infrastructure now integrates with Peaq’s ecosystem of DePIN innovators. Furthermore, Vries stated that their joint work on Farmsent is shaping up to be a very promising early use case.

$2.1 Billion Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Expire After US CPI Data


Today, $2.1 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options will be liquidated. The expiration of these crypto options contracts is particularly interesting, given that it will happen after the US core consumer price index (CPI) data has been released.
How will this impact the prices of these digital assets and the broader crypto market volatility?
How Does the Recent US Inflation Data Affect the Crypto Options Market?

Approximately $1.18 million in 18,183 Bitcoin options contracts will expire. The tranche is very similar to the 18,359 contracts settled last week.
Deribit data indicates that Bitcoin’s put-to-call ratio is 0.62. This figure suggests a prevalence of purchase options (calls) over sales options (puts).
Furthermore, the data shows that Bitcoin’s maximum pain point is $63,000. The maximum pain point is the price at which the asset will cause financial losses to the greatest number of holders.

In addition to Bitcoin options, 321,925 Ethereum contracts will expire today. These expiring contracts have a notional value of over $940 million, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.27 and a pain point of $3,000.

Greeks.live, a tools provider for crypto options traders, shared its perspective on today’s expiring options contracts. It assessed the impact of the release of US inflation data on the crypto options market.

Opportunity? Crypto expert predicts ‘one last nuke’ for XRP


As many assets in the cryptocurrency sector near the week’s end on a positive note, XRP seems to be one of them, albeit recording only minor advances often mixed with sudden drops, and one crypto expert believes that the popular token is about to make one last dip before bullish recovery.
Specifically, pseudonymous crypto trading analyst CoinsKid observed that XRP could go through “one last nuke” toward $0.4018 as part of its five-wave price action with bullish divergence before a massive recovery to $0.7478, as he explained in his X post shared on May 16.

At the same time, the crypto market analyst believes that such a price action would offer an opportunity to “go all in at that point,” in other words, to buy XRP at a low price but also referring to his viewpoint as a potential “bear hopium,” suggesting irrational or unwarranted optimism.


XRP price analysis
Meanwhile, XRP was at press time changing hands at the price of $0.52256, which represents an increase of 0.24% in the last 24 hours, as it grew its value by 1% across the previous seven days and a slightly higher 4.03% on its monthly chart, as per data on May 17.

At the same time, it is worth noting that XRP whales are already taking the opportunity to accumulate more of the token at the center of the widely publicized courtroom standoff between blockchain company Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Indeed, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has recently noticed a significant accumulation from addresses with a balance between 1 million and 10 million XRP in the previous 15 days, their total holdings growing by 110 million XRP in a yearly high and bullish divergence.

Donald Trump's Crypto-Friendly Stance Genuine Or Opportunistic?

                        Presidential candidate Donald Trump recently expressed his backing for crypto, indicating that he would cease hostility towards crypto in the US if he were to be re-elected.“If we’re going to embrace it, we have to let them be.” He also told the audience that if they like crypto, “you better vote for Trump.”Previously, Trump openly criticized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In July 2019, he described them as “not money” and condemned their volatility and absence of intrinsic value. Additionally, he contended that these assets could facilitate illegal activities such as drug trafficking.Crypto’s Role in Shaping Voter Preferences
According to Coinbase, about 20% of American adults, or over 50m individuals, claim to hold crypto. Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO Network, said that this substantial figure has undoubtedly captured the attention of the candidates.“To embrace crypto and solid crypto regulation is a good election strategy and clever policy more generally,” he said. “Absolutely, a sizable number of people in the crypto community will vote for Trump based on his seemingly positive approach towards the industry.”Meanwhile, Jonathan Thomas, CEO of prime brokerage Blueberry, asserted that Trump’s crypto-friendly stance will influence voters prioritizing crypto as a single-issue matter.“This is an aspect that some people hold dear to their hearts, and will vote for which candidate supports their bias,” he said. His crypto-friendly talk will resonate with crypto enthusiasts, but only if it doesn’t clash with other issues they care about even more, he added.Skepticism Surrounding Donald Trump’s Crypto Advocacy
NFT enthusiast Thorne Melcher labeled Trump’s recent endorsement as “flimsy.” She noted it marks a significant departure from his previous negative remarks.“Given crypto’s potential to facilitate the purchase of trans hormone replacement therapy, abortions, and drugs circumventing politics pushed by conservatives, it only feels like a matter of time before they involve it in their authoritarian crackdowns,” she said.However, she noted that this doesn’t imply that Biden is favorable towards cryptocurrency. Yet, supporting Trump solely for the sake of crypto doesn’t seem to offer substantial benefits, and Trump himself is unlikely to gain much electoral support solely by endorsing it.Trump’s Strategy to Woo Crypto Voters Away from Biden
Once a crypto skeptic, Trump has now become a full-fledged NFT enthusiast. He actively participates in the market, even selling over $1m worth of NFTs, some featuring his mugshot.According to Stephanie Vaughan, co-founder of DeFi firm Veda, it’s evident that many individuals within the crypto community are inclined to support Trump or refrain from supporting Biden.“I think that during the last election, there were probably a lot of crypto-focused voters who voted for Biden. Because, at that time, it wasn’t clear that he would take such a hardline approach against the industry,” she said.“It’s clear now, however, that regulation by enforcement is the stance taken by the Biden Administration. And this is totally unworkable for a very large number of people who work in the industry or who are generally favorable towards it.”She said that Trump acknowledges crypto’s emergence as a significant factor for a considerable portion of voters in the upcoming election. Consequently, he’s making concerted efforts to attract them away from Biden.

JPMorgan Names Key Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Won't Rally Hard


Banking giant JPMorgan does not expect the price of Bitcoin to experience a substantial rally. Any potential upside will be "limited" due to waning demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Moreover, JPMorgan cited the failure of Hong Kong's cryptocurrency ETF to support its rather cautious stance.  According to Bloomberg, the extremely underwhelming performance of crypto ETFs has put a dent in Hong Kong's crypto hub ambitions. The products, which debuted just two weeks ago, are already suffering from outflows. For comparison, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw enormous demand following their launch, with BlacRock's IBIT breaking multiple records.  The estimated mining cost The largest US bank has also estimated that the cost of mining one coin currently stands at $45,000 following the most recent halving event. JPMorgan has noted that a post-halving drop in the hashrate has been delayed by the rather short-lived success of the Runes protocol that pushed Bitcoin fees significantly higher. The top cryptocurrency is currently trading at $66,412 on the Bitstamp exchange.

Bitcoin: the mining farm in China closed by Biden will pass to the Americans

A few days ago, the US president Joe Biden prevented a Chinese company from building a Bitcoin mining farm near a nuclear missile base in Wyoming.
The decision was related to national security concerns linked to the proximity of the plant to an important military installation, as the ownership of the mining farm would have been indirectly linked to China. 
Yesterday, however, it was discovered that this same company, MineOne, had meanwhile sold the land to another Bitcoin mining company, this time American. 

Biden’s initiative: China’s Bitcoin mining farm passes to Americans
The American president opposed the construction of a Bitcoin mining farm within one mile of the Cheyenne military base using the powers of CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States).
Thanks to these powers, he was able to prevent the acquisition of the land by a company linked to China (MineOne). 
It is already the eighth time that Biden uses the powers of CFIUS to prevent acquisitions and activities related to China in the USA, so it was not an initiative against Bitcoin mining.
The problem was only the ties of the acquiring company with China, and obviously the proximity to the Cheyenne military base in Wyoming, where intercontinental ballistic missiles Minuteman III (ICBM) are housed.
This suggests that Biden should not oppose the construction of the mining farm in case the ownership is American.
The turning point
Yesterday it was discovered that actually, a few days before the block imposed by Biden, the land on which the Cheyenne mining farm should be built was purchased by an American mining company, CleanSpark, listed on the Nasdaq with the ticker CLSK. 
In the official announcement, CleanSpark states that it has reached an agreement to acquire 75 MW of Bitcoin mining sites in Wyoming for a total of 18.75 million dollars.
The company claims to have entered into definitive agreements for the acquisition of two sites for Bitcoin mining in Wyoming, with 75 MW of power already available and expandable by another 55 MW.
One of these would be the website owned by MineOne near the Cheyenne military base blocked by Biden. 
The curious thing is that the sale agreement to the American company Cheyenne would have taken place less than a week before the block imposed by Biden.
Although it is only an agreement, with the sale not yet concluded, Biden’s block sounds a bit strange. 
Indeed, one could also imagine that the president knew nothing about this agreement, but perhaps it is more likely that his initiative was actually aimed at forcing MineOne to accept the sale agreement to the American company CleanSpark. 
CleanSpark, on the other hand, has stated that they are not aware of the block, and that they are still willing to proceed with the acquisition. 
CleanSpark
CleanSpark owns and operates eight different data centers in the southern United States, with a total of almost 400 MW. Of these, 50 MW are located in a data center in the state of New York, to which the 75 MW already available in Wyoming will be added, along with another 55 MW on the new site. 
The two new Wyoming facilities will add more than 7 EH/s to CleanSpark’s hashrate, while the company had previously purchased three other Bitcoin mining sites in Mississippi with a total hashrate of 2.4 EH/s. 
Actually, CleanSpark is one of the largest BTC miners in North America. 
The CEO, Zach Bradford, stated: 
“Just three months ago we made the leap and expanded into Mississippi. Today I am pleased to share that we are continuing our journey with our expansion westward into Wyoming. Diversifying our portfolio is an integral part of our strategy and we are well positioned to take advantage of similar acquisitions in the wake of the halving”. 
The price of CLSK shares on the stock market has been trading sideways since mid-February. 
The absolute peak was reached in 2018, and in 2021 it briefly surpassed $42.
During the bear-market of 2022 there was a real crash, which brought the price down to below $2, but between 2023 and 2024 there was a rebound. 
Last year, the price of CLSK shares returned above $10, and this year it has pushed up to over $24 in March. 
Since then it has dropped below $17, which is much higher than the bottom of the bear market, but still significantly lower than the highs of 2021. 
It is worth noting that CleanSpark is valued at around 3.7 billion dollars on the stock exchange, while for example Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), the benchmark for US Bitcoin mining companies, is valued at almost 5.4 billion dollars. The other major competitor, Riot Platform (RIOT), is valued at less than 3 billion.

                        The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) China President recently shared insights on the challenges and solutions for cross-border central bank digital currency (CBDC) interoperability.In an interview with 21st Century Business Herald, Wen Yang addressed the fragmentation in CBDC systems due to varying technological paths and standards among different economies, highlighting the organization’s effort to bridge technical gaps.CBDCs Face Cross-Border Challenges
According to the report, over 130 economies are now exploring CBDCs, with nearly 70% of central banks expecting to issue them within the next decade. However, the rapid development could lead to potential “data silos” where systems are unable to communicate with one another.“Currently, there are significant differences in the technological paths and standards, including protocols, among economies, which presents a ‘fragmentation’ challenge and leads to ‘data silos’,” said Yang.“To date, 11 countries have fully launched their CBDCs, while others are in later stages of development,” said Yang.China’s digital yuan has seen implementation across various applications, while the European Central Bank is in the process of preparing for a digital Euro. In India, commercial banks handle one million digital rupee transactions daily across the country.Sandbox Second Phase to Explore Solutions
Swift launched the second phase of its CBDC sandbox in July 2023, focusing on complex use cases in digital trade, digital assets, and foreign exchange networks for CBDC payments and settlements.“The project lasted six months and involved 38 financial institutions from around the world, including regulators, commercial banks, and market infrastructures, involving applications of seven different CBDCs,” said Yang.Yang also emphasized the importance of interoperability in cross-border CBDC use. The sandbox results reaffirmed SWIFT’s proposal to simplify digital transactions while allowing financial institutions to continue utilizing their existing infrastructures.“Tests on the interaction between digital trade platforms and CBDC networks using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and smart contracts have proven technically feasible for automating trade payments,” stated Yang.He indicated that Swift plans to expand its CBDC connector solution to test more extensive use cases in a comprehensive environment. This would include enhancing support for on-chain forex settlements and cross-border payments, addressing growing market demands.

NFT Buyer Sues Dolce & Gabbana Over Value Loss


							

Dolce & Gabbana NFT Lawsuit: Buyer Sues Over Value Drop



Fashion Brand Sued: NFT Collection Value Plummets 



Suit claims company mismanagement caused value erosion




A customer in the Southern District of New York has sued luxury fashion brand Dolce & Gabbana USA Inc., alleging the fashion house mismanaged a collection of NFTs, leading to a significant decline in their value.



The lawsuit, filed by Luke Brown, as reported by Bloomberg, centers on the DGFamily NFTs, which were marketed as offering a combination of digital wearables, physical goods, and exclusive experiences. Mr Brown had paid nearly $6,000 for the DGFamily NFTs that lost 97% of their value.Dolce & Gabbana marketed these NFTs as providing a mix of digital, physical, and experiential benefits.



Mr. Brown’s complaint contends that Dolce & Gabbana failed to deliver on these promises. The lawsuit alleges delays in receiving the NFTs and associated benefits, with the digital wearables only usable on a niche metaverse platform that had limited user engagement.









Additionally, the complaint claims Dolce & Gabbana neglected to secure proper approvals from the platform, further delaying access for token holders. The lawsuit argues that this pattern of unfulfilled promises reflects a broader issue with the DGFamily NFT project.



Mr. Brown accuses the company of abandoning the project and its community after failing to deliver on its initial commitments. He seeks to represent a class of all those who purchased DGFamily NFTs, claiming financial losses due to the alleged mismanagement. UNXD, the online marketplace where the NFTs were sold, is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit.

                        The Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), France’s local financial commission, has reminded investors in a warning note published Thursday, to refrain from trading crypto platform, ByBit.ByBit, which is one of the largest crypto exchanges globally, scored significant growth in the recent past. The exchange hit 20 million registered users after 5 years of operation in 2023.However, the exchange has been under scrutiny in France for its lack of non-compliance with current regulations. As a result, the French regulator blacklisted the platform in 20 May 2022.“ByBit is not authorized to provide its digital asset services in France,” the notice read.“In this regard, the AMF is urging French retail investors who have invested on this platform to take all necessary measures to avoid being unable to access their assets.”Further, AMF stressed that ByBit did not receive a digital asset service provider (DASP) license in France. The regulator has the right to take legal action to block the platform’s website, it added.“Unregistered platforms providing these services in France are illegal under French law,” AMF reiterated.In a similar tone, the AMF also warned investors against Bitget crypto exchange last month. It reminded users about the platform’s blacklisting in November 2023.Hong Kong Added ByBit Among “Suspicious Crypto Exchanges”
In March, Hong Kong’s markets regulator added ByBit to its list of suspicious cryptocurrency exchanges. It also placed several of the crypto exchange’s products on its suspicious investment products list.The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) noted that investors risk losing their entire investment and that it will not hesitate to take enforcement action.According to a ByBit’s spokesperson, the exchange has been maintaining “a close dialogue with regulators around the world including HK” and is striving to comply with all necessary regulations.“Since different products are listed for various regions to meet local compliance requirements, you can be confident that these products are not available in the HK market,” a source reavealed earlier.

Such a statistic makes Solana roughly 46 times faster than Ethereum, and 5 times faster than Polygon.To determine the fastest blockchains, CoinGecko’s study analyzed the processing speed of the top 30 blockchains based on their total value locked (TVL) ranking on DefiLlama as of May 15, 2024. Processing speed was measured using the actual or realized transactions per second (TPS) metric, calculated as a daily average to ensure a standardized comparison across as many blockchains as possible.CoinGecko claims the highest real TPS values reported in the study may differ from other calculations because these use daily averages. The TPS data was sourced from publicly available information provided by the respective blockchain explorers and Dune Analytics. However, some blockchains, including Hyperliquid, PulseChain, Kava, Cardano, and Rootstock, were excluded from the study due to a lack of sufficient data.FindingsDespite ranking as the fastest blockchain, Solana has still only achieved 1.6% of its theoretical maximum speed of 65,000 TPS, CoinGecko claims. The surging number of transactions resulted in network congestion, and it remains to be seen how quickly Solana can record higher real TPS after its upcoming upgrades.The second-fastest blockchain is another non-EVM, Sui, which recorded its highest real TPS of 854 in July 2023 as onchain game Sui 8192 gained popularity. Other fast blockchains among the non-EVMs include TON at 175 TPS and Near Protocol at 118 TPS. Altogether, the 8 non-EVM large blockchains have an average peak TPS of 284, making them 3.9 times faster than the 17 largest EVM and EVM-compatible blockchains, which realized an average of just 74 TPS.Among the EVM blockchains, BNB Smart Chain (BSC) achieved 378 in real TPS on December 7, 2023, amid the inscriptions-driven surge in onchain activity. This makes BSC the fastest blockchain among EVMs, despite only ranking third overall and reaching less than half of Sui’s realized processing speed.Similarly, the inscriptions craze allowed Polygon to record 190 in real TPS on November 16, 2023, making it the fastest among the largest Ethereum scaling solutions and 8.4 times faster than Ethereum itself.Ethereum and its ten largest scaling solutions registered a total real TPS of 500, placing their combined processing speed ahead of BSC but still slower than Solana and Sui.Almost all of the 25 blockchains experienced their highest real TPS over the last one year, pointing to onchain activity increasing and reaching higher levels in recent months, led by inscriptions and meme coin speculation.

Binance Kazakhstan Earns Security Certifications, Hosts Successful Meetup


							

Binance hosted a meetup in Kazakhstan, attracting over 700 attendees



Binance Kazakhstan had earlier secured ISO 27001 and ISO 27701 certifications from British Standards Institution



The meetup and security certifications highlight Binance Kazakhstan’s efforts to foster a thriving Web3 ecosystem in the region




Binance hosted its first major community meetup of 2024 in Kazakhstan on May 14, attracting over 700 attendees, according to a company announcement. The event, held at the Presidential Center in Astana, offered participants a chance to connect with fellow Web3 enthusiasts and learn about the latest developments in the decentralized web space.







In an earlier announcement, Binance drew the community’s attention to the event schedule. Inviting every member to the grand event, Binance wrote,




 “We are pleased to announce another big event in Kazakhstan – Binance Super Meetup, which will take place on May 14, 2024 in Astana. We invite all our users from Kazakhstan to participate in the Binance Super Meetup, organized by the Binance team.”




According to the announcement, the event was scheduled at the Presidential Center (Grand Ballroom), 1A Alikhan Bokeikhanova Street, Astana, from 15:30 to 20:00, per the local time. The platform provided free entry to the event, and the participants were required to complete pre-registration and present a printed or electronic ticket.



The meetup capped off a period of positive news for Binance Kazakhstan. On May 13, the company announced it had secured the ISO 27001 and ISO 27701 certifications, demonstrating its commitment to robust information security and privacy management practices. The certifications were awarded by the British Standards Institution (BSI) following a rigorous audit.



The British Standards Institution (BSI) awarded Binance Kazakhstan these globally recognized certificates following a meticulous audit. Vishal Sacheendran, Head of Regional Markets at Binance, acknowledged the achievement as a demonstration of the platform’s adherence to high standards of security and privacy, two features that he believes are characteristic of a trustworthy company.

Pump.fun exploiter doxxed himself then took credit with bizarre tweets


Pump.fun, a Solana-based platform that promises you can ‘launch a coin that is instantly tradeable’ was exploited for approximately $2 million worth of Solana by a hacker who seemed to subsequently promise to distribute the exploited funds to other Solana users.
According to pump.fun, “the TVL in the protocol right now is safe” and “if you have ever connected your wallet to http://pump.fun, your wallet is safe.”
An X (formerly Twitter) user with the username STACCoverflow, who has previously posted images suggesting their name is Jarett Reginald S Dunn, appears to have taken credit for the exploit in a series of unusual posts.

In this series of tweets, he claims that the exploited funds will end up being distributed to people who hold other tokens.
Various users on X have claimed to receive distributions but it’s not clear what criteria are being used to distribute the tokens.
The exploit took advantage of flash loans to quickly overwhelm certain bonding curves on the platform.

A review of the pump.fun website doesn’t appear to include security audits for the contracts that were exploited or the contracts that were deployed to replace them.

Notcoin in focus as KangaMoon excites with bonus sale - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Notcon (NOT) token’s price fell sharply after its debut on exchanges.
KangaMoon (KANG) is offering a bonus presale stage ahead of first CEX listing.

Analysts say the lackluster spot Bitcoin ETFs market means Bitcoin prices could see limited upside action in coming weeks and months. 
What does this mean for newly-launched Notcoin and could KangaMoon offer a better investment opportunity?
Notcoin dumps after airdrop
Notcoin (NOT) is the native token of a tap-to-earn game project that aims to onboard millions of users to Web3.
The project went viral amid its debut on Telegram, and saw massive hype ahead of its trading debut this week. Much of this was down to listing announcements from top crypto exchanges Binance, OKX and Bybit among others.
Indeed, Notcoin traded at a Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) of $1 billion as the token made its debut across exchanges. However, NOT price has tanked 67% since and currently trades around $0.006753.
Binance’s cancelling of support for the NOT/BTC pair also added to the downside pressure. 
Notcoin is however likely to record a decent bounce if the broader gaming ecosystem picks up new traction following a dismal 2024. Bitcoin‘s performance could also add to the dynamics.
KangaMoon emerging as top meme-inspired cryptocurrency
The meme coin space has seen some big moves for Solana, BNB Chain and Ethereum meme tokens. 
While a few meme coins exhibit massive growth potential, most others are largely weak copycats that derive momentum from nothing but hype.
Utility sets KangaMoon apart from most of these other meme coins. 
As a project, KangaMoon integrates GameFi and Play-To-Earn (P2E). There’s also a SocialFi element that means users can earn more as they interact, share and connect.
The native in-game currency and network reward token when the P2E game launches will be KANG. Presale participants can earn KANG right away by joining in challenges and contests – a factor that already sees KangaMoon boast a growing community of users.
Is KangaMoon a better opportunity?
KangaMoon (KANG) is one of the tokens expected to dominate the meme coin market. The project’s presale has so far raised more than $6.7 million.
KangaMoon’s smart contract has been audited by both Solid Proof and InterFi, a fact that adds to the confidence crypto enthusiasts and investors are showing in this project.
After rallying through the presale stages, KangaMoon is now offering those who might have missed out another chance with a bonus sale round. The current KANG price in this phase is $0.025.
As the limited bonus round quickly sells out, this might be a great time to join the community. 
KangaMoon’s rigorous audits and team transparency are also positive factors, as is news that KANG is poised for its CEX listing debut on BitMart.
Compared to other meme coins, KangaMoon’s community-driven P2E game focus and utility stand out. The project’s total supply of 1 billion KANG also means it has the potential to explode higher amid market demand.
Investors however need to take into account other market dynamics and conditions.
You can learn more about KangaMoon here.

Shiba Inu's Lead Developer Shytoshi Kusama Lauds Team Behind ShibaSwap's Integration With Shibarium Network: 'So Much More In Store' - Benzinga

Shytoshi Kusama, the mysterious lead developer of the Shiba Inu SHIB/USD project, lauded the work of the team instrumental in bringing the ecosystem's decentralized exchange ShibaSwap to the layer-2 network, Shibarium. What Happened: In a post on social platform X, the pseudonymous personality, also believed to be the co-founder of Shiba Inu, wrote that he is proud of the efforts put in by the team in linking the two of the ecosystem's biggest platforms. Kusama had a special word of appreciation for Kaal Dhairya, a key developer in the Shiba Inu ecosystem."So proud of the improvements and innovations @kaaldhairya and the team have made while bringing ShibaSwap to Shibarium."In what could be a signal of more such developments in the ecosystem, Kusama added, "So much more in store as we march forward. Stay tuned #SHIBARMY!"Kaal Dhairya responded to Kusama's celebratory post and assured the SHIB community that new enhancements and updates would be shipped regularly going forward. "It's not a race it's a marathon," the developer remarked.Why It Matters: ShibaSwap, which launched in July 2021, has been operating as a DEX on the Ethereum ETH/USD blockchain, providing services such as staking, liquidity pools, and yield farming.With the latest development, the DEX went multichain, allowing users to swap tokens across both chains, thereby managing liquidity in a much better way. Shibaswap’s launch also provided a solid use case for Shibarium–a planned endeavor by Shiba Inu to rise above its memecoin image and add more value to the tokens associated with the ecosystem.Price Action: At the time of writing, SHIB was exchanging hands at $0.00002489, down 2.91% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian Highlights Democrats, Including Chuck Schumer, Who Crossed Party Line To Support Pro-Crypto LawImage via CryptoFX on Shutterstock

Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs Continued for the Fourth Day in a Row! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reported a significant net inflow of $257.34 million on Thursday, marking the fourth day of positive inflows. This ongoing trend highlights growing investor interest and confidence in Bitcoin ETFs.
US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record Inflows for the Fourth Day in a Row, Totaling $257 Million
Leading the inflows was BlackRock's IBIT, which injected $94 million into the fund, making it the largest recipient of new capital among its peers.


According to SoSoValue data, IBIT had experienced minimal to no flows in the previous three weeks, and this increase was particularly notable. Fidelity's FBTC fund attracted $67 million in investments, while Ark Invest and 21Shares' Bitcoin ETF reported net inflows of $62 million.
Grayscale's GBTC, which has mostly seen large outflows since its conversion in January, recorded daily net inflows of $4.64 million on Thursday.






Valkyrie's Bitcoin ETF also saw significant activity, with $18.5 million in inflows. Other funds from Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Invesco and Galaxy Digital reported single-digit inflows.
The consecutive net inflows into 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US come in the middle of Wall Street's first quarter 13F reporting season.


Major financial players announced their stakes in these funds and the results exceeded many expectations. BlackRock's IBIT fund, in particular, reported a record 414 holders in its first 13F season.
“Even having 20 owners as a newborn is a big deal, it's pretty rare,” Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented on Thursday.

This is Ripple's Most Important Exec, According to the Company's CTO


																TL;DR

Ripple CTO David Schwartz considers this co-founder the most important person in the company’s history for his early commitment, among other reasons.
Attorney John E Deaton believes CEO Brad Garlinghouse has played a crucial role in the firm’s legal successes and should be labeled “CEO of the decade” if the firm goes public.


Who is Ripple’s Most Valuable Member?
David Schwartz – chief technology officer at Ripple – recently allowed X users to shoot him with all sorts of questions. One person asked him who was the most important person in Ripple’s history as he could only point one from five choices: Jed McCaleb (CTO of the firm until 2013), Schwartz himself, Chris Larsen (Executive Chairman), Brad Garlinghouse (CEO), or others.
The current chief technology officer picked Larsen because of his commitment to the idea when that “was hard to do.” He also admitted that the Executive Chairman “really believed” in Ripple’s potential “well before” him.
Chris Larsen is one of the co-founders of Ripple Labs – the fintech company behind Ripple and the XRP Ledger. He served as the firm’s CEO until 2016, when he brought on Brad Garlinghouse to take the helm. 
Larsen took a blow in December 2020 when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a legal action against Ripple, Garlinghouse, and himself. The regulator accused them of raising over $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. 




However, the watchdog dropped charges against the executives in October 2023. This represented Ripple’s third partial court victory, which, according to some, positioned the agency as the underdog in the lawsuit.
The legal spat recently entered its trial phase, with both parties presenting necessary documents and abiding by the magistrates’ rules. Earlier this month, the American lawyer Jeremy Hogan claimed that the briefs stage had been completed, and now the entities must wait for the judge’s ruling.
Garlinghouse’s Contribution to Ripple’s Advancement
According to John E Deaton (a well-known US attorney who stands behind thousands of XRP investors in the case against the SEC), Brad Garlinghouse should be put on the pedestal. He thinks the CEO has played the biggest role in Ripple’s achievements in the legal field. 
Deaton went further, suggesting that Garlinghouse must be included in “the shortlist for CEO of the decade” if the company files for an initial public offering (IPO) in the next few years.

Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL) to Explode 13,000% as BitMart Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because DOGESOL has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on BitMart.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Baby Doge on Sol can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Baby Doge on Sol could become the next viral memecoin.



Baby Doge on Sol launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Baby Doge on Sol on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the BitMart listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Baby Doge on Sol by entering its contract address – G5GEMyeea1HqS2KnpazPiMuTy3sqS1UdQegsbNLGpF7U – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGESOL.

Crypto theft in Solana's Pump.fun, crypto king arrested, and more... - AMBCrypto



Solana’s Pump.fun and Stacks-based ALEX suffered attacks worth millions 
United States’ DOJ also arrested two brothers linked to a $25M Ethereum exploit

Crypto-regulations and exploits have dominated market headlines this week. From Solana’s Pump.fun to Bitcoin’s L2 ecosystem, the exploits have siphoned millions of dollars. 
Solana’s memecoin launcher Pump.fun suffered an exploit on Thursday, leading to about $2 million in losses. This, according to the Head of Research at Wintermute – Igor Igamberdiev.
Surprisingly, the attack came just hours after the platform hit record-high revenues and surpassed Solana, its L1 blockchain security. 
According to Pump.fun, the platform was compromised by a former employee who claimed responsibility for the attack. Announcing the resumption of normal operations, the memecoin launcher soon revealed, 
“The pump.fun contracts are safe. They have always been safe. A former employee used their privileged position at the company to misappropriate ~12.3K SOL (~$1.9m)” 
More crypto hacks and arrests
Solana’s ecosystem wasn’t the only one to suffer an exploit yesterday. Another attack was recorded on Bitcoin’s ecosystem project ALEX — An automated liquidity exchange based on Stacks [STX], a BTC L2 scaling solution. 
Interestingly, the attack also involved a compromised private key, draining the protocol of several assets, including 13.7 million STX. 
The project recovered some funds and proposed asking Stacks to burn the accounts linked to the stolen STX funds. However, Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali declined the request, citing, 
“The ALEX private key compromise is unfortunate. There is no clarity contract issue or exploit, though.”
It remains to be seen how the rest of the lost funds at Pump.fun and ALEX will be recovered. 
In the meantime, some long-running crypto-crimes saw major charges and arrests. For instance, the U.S DoJ arrested two brothers for an alleged attack on the Ethereum network. Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno have been accused of stealing $25 million using sophisticated MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) bots. This episode marks the first DOJ lawsuit against MEV. 
Also, Canadian authorities recently arrested the controversial ‘Canadian crypto-king,’ Aiden Pleterski. Pleterski was allegedly running a crypto investment scam as recently as February, despite being petitioned for bankruptcy over a year ago over similar schemes that saw investors lose over $40 million. According to a report, Pleterski was arrested and charged with money laundering. However, he has now been released after bail.

Cryptocurrency Market Comeback? Stablecoins' Market Caps Show 25% Surge

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions.

The bounce we have witnessed this week on the cryptocurrency market has been validated by the growth of stablecoins' market capitalization. The growth of stable assets is a crucial indicator reflecting inflows into the industry and can be used as a gauge of external investors' sentiment.With crypto prices back on the rise, a good sign that this upward trend may continue would be if stablecoin market caps resume the growth they saw from mid-October to mid-April. During that period, the combined market caps of USDT, USDC, DAI, BUSD, USDP and TUSD soared by 25%. This increase supported rising trading volumes and indicated investors' willingness to keep their funds in cryptocurrencies instead of liquidating them. However, over the past four weeks, this growth in fiat-pegged crypto has flatlined. The combined market cap of the top six stablecoins has remained relatively stable, showing neither significant growth nor decline. This stagnation could be a crucial indicator of market sentiment moving forward.Pay attention to which direction these market caps go from here, as they will likely help foreshadow whether Bitcoin pushes toward a new all-time high or dips below $60,000 again. If stablecoin market caps start to rise again, they would suggest renewed confidence among investors and an influx of capital onto the crypto market.On the contrary, if these market caps begin to shrink, it could indicate that investors are pulling out of crypto and converting their holdings back into fiat, which is a negative sign for the market that will most likely lead to a substantial price correction and return below values we saw recently.

DTCC Successfully Creates Pilot to Send Data on Chainlink


The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has successfully completed the Smart NAV pilot, a collaborative effort involving ten market participants.
The pilot used Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability platform to deliver data on-chain and integrate it into various blockchain applications.

DTCC Develops a Pilot Using Chainlink 
The Smart NAV pilot marks a significant step forward in the digital transformation of financial services. By utilizing Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network, DTCC ensured secure and efficient transmission of NAV data. This data is a critical metric for mutual funds.
The system could disseminate and automate the data in real time while integrating access to historical data. Meanwhile, DTCC provides that data and acts as the “solution governor” in the chain where the data is under security.
Upon obtaining the data, the system transforms it from “legacy” file-based formats to a modern structure and includes it in a blockchain transaction. Chainlink’s CCIP then routes the delivery and takes responsibility for transmitting the message to relevant blockchain networks.
Likewise, the data will only be available for customer consumption through the pilot’s new computing methods. The DTCC explains that expanding capabilities start at a data dissemination point, where it transforms data to send to public or private blockchains.

Bitcoin bridge XLink resurrection underway post $10M hack

XLink, an established Bitcoin blockchain bridge, is prepping a comeback after it shut down on May 15 after suffering a $10 million hack.XLink was the victim of a security breach involving its Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) endpoints. The XLink team first disclosed the breach in the early hours of May 15, which is now coming to a close on May 17 as the team prepares to resume normal operations.Source: XLink.btcThe attacker exploited compromised private keys via a phishing scheme, which allowed them to control the BSC and Ethereum endpoints and withdraw around $4.3 million without authorization. However, according to XLink, a white hat hacker soon recovered the stolen assets.Cointelegraph reached out to XLink for comment but didn't received a response by publication. “No endpoints other than BSC and Ethereum were affected by this exploit,” the company’s official statement said.Source: XLink.btcDespite the recovery on the BSC, approximately $5 million in mostly LunarCrush tokens remain locked on the Ethereum blockchain. However, the LunarCrush team is working closely with XLink to secure these funds — the majority of the $5 million has been “recovered or secured.”Another $5 million worth of funds are locked on Ethereum, mainly LunarCrush tokens. The @LunarCrush team, in close coordination with the XLink team, has implemented measures to secure those tokens.According to XLink, residual crypto funds worth around $500,000 are still locked on Ethereum, but a majority of the funds have been either recovered or secured.Related: $20M exploit cripples Sonne Finance, hacker in no mood for negotiationIn response to the initial incident, the XLink team reacted quickly, temporarily suspending all operations on the bridge to conduct a thorough investigation. The investigation was carried out collaboratively with the team’s security partners — including Ancilia — and their Binance team liaisons.Source: XLink.btcXLink has insisted that all users who interacted with the compromised contracts should revoke any approved spending limits. The team issued detailed instructions, and links were provided for ETH and BSC users to mitigate further risk to funds:“As we prepare to reopen XLink, it is urgent that Ethereum and BSC users check that their wallets have revoked access to the old compromised endpoint contracts. This step will assist in completely severing any connections with the compromised contract and mitigating any associated risks.”Users failing to do so remain at risk of losing their funds to the attacker.Another exploit recently hit pump.fun — a Solana memecoin creation tool — after it was claimed that a former employee took the firm for almost $2 million through a “bonding curve” attack. According to pump.fun, on May 16, the ex-employee took actions to compromise the protocol’s internal systems. The smart contracts have since been announced as “safe,” and victims of the incident will have “100% of [their] liquidity” restored. Magazine: UK cannabis millionaire’s legal ‘deals on wheels’ via crypto

Hong Kong's Spot Crypto ETFs Struggle as US Gains Ground


After roughly two weeks of trading, Hong Kong’s debut of spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has failed to excite as expected.
Data shows a significant decrease in the total assets of six newly launched Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong. This drop highlights the challenges Hong Kong faces in the competitive crypto market.
Challenges Facing Hong Kong’s Ambitions as a Crypto Hub

According to SoSo Value data, the total net assets of Hong Kong’s spot Bitcoin ETFs fell from $247.72 million on April 30 to $231.05 million on May 16. The total net assets for Ethereum ETFs also dropped from $45.03 million to $40.29 million during the same period.
BeInCrypto reported earlier that China Asset Management, Bosera HashKey, and Harvest International each listed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong on April 30. These ETFs initially drew huge optimism due to their availability in foreign currencies, including US dollars and Renminbi (RMB).

Furthermore, these products are also accessible to international investors who meet local compliance standards. Therefore, many see these ETFs as diversification for Hong Kong’s stock market offerings.
These products also provide new investment opportunities for both professional and retail investors. However, mainland Chinese investors remain restricted from accessing Hong Kong’s spot crypto ETFs.
Despite its relatively modest performance, Hong Kong’s ETFs have attracted international partnerships. Earlier this month, MetaComp, a Singapore-based fintech companies, collaborated with Bosera and Harvest Global Investment to promote these ETFs globally.
At the same time, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs have been showing better performance. SoSo Value data shows a total net inflow of $257.34 million for US spot Bitcoin ETFs as of May 16. This marks the fourth consecutive day of positive flows.

Additionally, recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that institutional investors like Millennium Management and Susquehanna hold significant positions in US spot Bitcoin ETFs.
The disparity in performance highlights the vast difference in market sizes between Hong Kong and the US. A Hang Seng Investment Management report pointed out that as of August 2023, the combined ETF assets under management (AUM) in several Asia-Pacific markets, including Hong Kong, represented about 10% of the total ETF AUM in the US.

This figure suggests that while Asia-Pacific markets need to catch up to the US in scale and investor participation. However, analysts at Hang Seng Investment Management have suggested considerable potential for further expansion in the ETF market across the seven Asia Pacific markets.

“The fact that the ETF’s share as a percentage of market capitalization in the seven Asia Pacific markets is relatively low suggests that there is still ample room for further expansion. It also highlights the significant growth potential of the region as index investing continues to mature,” they wrote.

This situation might challenge Hong Kong’s attempts to position itself as a global crypto hub. Compared to the performance of its US counterparts, the lukewarm reception of its crypto ETFs highlights the need for strategic adjustments. Enhanced accessibility for broader international engagement might be crucial in revitalizing Hong Kong’s crypto ETF market and achieving its global aspirations.

Why Is The Crypto Market Up Today?


The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) is nearing the crucial resistance of $2.4 trillion, while Bitcoin is holding above $65,500. While the market has cooled down from the recent rally, it still exhibits bullish signs. Making the most of this is Chainlink, which has registered a 21% rise in the last few days.
In the news today:-

The US Senate overturned the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin No.121 (SAB 121) following a 60-38 vote reflecting bipartisan support against SEC’s crypto policies.
Solana meme coin Pump.fun drained of $2 million after an insider attack executed by disrupting token listings by manipulating bonding curves.

The Total Market Cap Stays Strong

Following the recent rally, the total market cap is cooling down but keeping above the reclaimed support of $2.3 trillion. However, the target for the crypto market remains at $2.4 trillion, a barrier that has not been breached for nearly a month.
In the past, this level has proven to be crucial support, and a flip of it would enable TOTAL to bounce back and observe further growth.

On the other hand, a fall through $2.3 trillion would bring TOTAL back to around the $2.2 trillion mark.
Bitcoin Price Shows Resilience

Bitcoin’s price shot up to $66,000 this week in accordance with the broader market cues. Following a minor correction, BTC is currently trading at $65,500 and will likely continue to stay above the crucial psychological support of $65,000.
This will keep the optimism among the investors alive regarding potential growth in the next few trading sessions.

Bitcoin Price Analysis. Source: TradingView
Should Bitcoin price witness selling or profit-taking, the crypto asset could note a drawdown towards $63,000 and lower.

Chainlink Takes the Lead
Chainlink’s price noted an uptick, making LINK the best-performing asset in the past 24 hours. However, the altcoin rally has been going on for the past few days. Capitalizing on the broader market bullish cues, LINK observed a 21% rise in the last three days, bringing Chainlink to $15.
Currently, the altcoin is above the resistance of $15.6, trading at $15.7, inching closer to $16.

Read More: Chainlink (LINK) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030

If LINK holds above this support it could note further gains, however, a slip below the support of $15.6 could result in a drop to $14.4. This would erase over half of the growth observed in the last day.

Binance Helps Taiwan to Resolve $6.2M Crypto Fraud Case - DailyCoin


        

Binance has collaborated with a government to solve a crypto money laundering case.



The development follows a similar collaboration in India on May 1.



Binance said it will continue collaborating with law enforcement to promote a safe crypto industry.




The world’s largest crypto exchange by trade volume, Binance, has helped Taiwanese authorities resolve a criminal case involving illegal operators who allegedly facilitated scam groups’ laundering of millions through crypto.



The development comes after the crypto exchange collaborated with Indian authorities on May 1 to assist in seizing crypto assets worth about $10 million, linked to a case involving fraudulent online gaming app E-Nugget.



Resolving $6.2M Crypto Money Laundering Case



According to an announcement on May 17, Binance leveraged the expertise of its Financial Crimes Compliance (FCC) department to gather intelligence and provide “crucial insight” that helped Taiwanese authorities “detect potential suspects more effectively.”




“Upon request, Binance cooperated promptly, establishing a cross-border online meeting with the investigating officers and prosecutors, where Binance's seasoned FCC teams furnished valuable recommendations based on cryptocurrency flow analyses,” the announcement read.



The investigation’s findings unraveled an intricate web of illegal service providers who allowed fraud groups to launder money through crypto on their platforms. The groups allegedly used fake remittance proofs, customer conversation records, and falsified identity verification data “to appear legitimate.”



Following the revelation, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office indicted nine suspects and charged them with three counts, including aggravated fraud, violation of organized crime prevention regulations, and violation of the Money Laundering Control Act.



Commenting on the matter, Prosecutor Lo Wei-Yuan lauded Binance’s “active and ongoing collaboration” with Taiwanese authorities, underscoring the exchange’s commitment to counter financial crimes and foster a safe crypto industry.

Crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe sells all his Bitcoin; Here’s why


Not long after declaring his ‘opportunity cost’ strategy, which involves selling all of his Bitcoin (BTC) possessions, renowned cryptocurrency expert Michaël van de Poppe followed up on his announcement, stating he has, indeed, sold all of his Bitcoin and explaining his reasoning.
As it happens, van de Poppe said his recent actions did not mean he lost his faith in the maiden crypto asset, nor that he expected it to be topped out for this cycle, nor that he had “become a complete believer in Gold,” according to a long X post explanation on May 16.
Ultimate goal: more Bitcoin
Quite the opposite – the professional crypto trader said he did this because he is “aiming to get more Bitcoin back later in the year,” considering “it’s a bull cycle,” and reiterating his earlier doubts regarding the traditional four-year cycle of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset.



“In the past week, we’ve seen that pension funds, insurance companies, and the biggest hedge funds of the U.S. have been allocating funds towards the Spot Bitcoin ETF. CME Group has announced a futures ETF to be launched, and sooner than later, we’ll be getting option based trading through which Bitcoin becomes a mature asset in the world.”

Therefore, he believes this would gradually reduce the simplicity of the four-year cycle and the impact of the halvings, “as institutions do care more about risk appetite in their portfolio combined with macroeconomic events,” and they will derisk amid liquidity drying up and the dollar strengthening.
Due to these factors, van de Poppe argues “this cycle is, relatively, the final easy cycle to make a lot of money through altcoins” in several ways, but he is choosing the riskiest one – trading “altcoins within the Web 3.0 ecosystem to get more Bitcoin,” where wrong timing could mean losing his BTC.
Why now?
As for his timing, he explained the world is becoming “about getting as much Bitcoin and Gold as you can. Hard assets. Salable assets, because [quantitative easing (QE)] will start sooner than later and inflation is killing your purchasing power, living standard and pleasure in life,” hence “Bitcoin is the outcome.”
Furthermore, “if you’re looking at previous cycles, you would suggest that the rotation from Bitcoin to the altcoins (around the halving) happens prior to the halving. This time it’s entirely different as the markets continued to show strength.”
On top of that, van de Poppe opined that the downward pressure on altcoins has been “unreasonably hard” and that “the upside can’t be denied,” as well as that “DePIN and RWA are going to be massive, more and more traditional companies are transitioning towards the Web 3.0 ecosystem,” which is why:

“It’s time to allocate yourself into this if you want to make a large return.”

Pros and cons
As he pointed out, this strategy could give him a “return of 300-900% in the coming 6-12 months in Bitcoin value,” or even “another 300-600% (…) if Bitcoin stabilizes through that period, (…) through which you could say that 900-4500% is the ballpark of a potential return for the coming 12-24 months in this super cycle.”
On the other hand, van de Poppe stressed that the downside of his bet could be “relatively huge,” as he is currently “down around 20% already in a matter of 1-2 weeks on the overall investment,” and that he could lose 50-80%, but that he was fine with that, “as I’ll find ways of continuing my life to generating income anyway.”
Bitcoin price analysis
Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently trading at the price of $66,110, which suggests a modest advance of 0.26% in the last 24 hours, a more significant gain of 4.80% across the previous seven days, and an accumulated advance of 4.37% on its monthly chart, as per data on May 17.

All things considered, Michaël van de Poppe’s strategy might make sense, but he is an experienced trader with full awareness of all the risks and downsides, so doing one’s own research is critical before attempting to emulate his practices, particularly as trends in this sector can change suddenly.

Chainlink (LINK) Shoots Up 19% Post DTCC Partnership Reveal | Coinspeaker



The surge in LINK price can be attributed to the announcement of the partnership between DTCC and the decentralized Oracle network. 

Chainlink (LINK) shot up by almost 19% in the past 24 hours following the announcement of its partnership with the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a financial market infrastructure company based in the United States.
According to the data from CoinMarketCap, the price of LINK, the fifteenth largest crypto asset by market capitalization, has gone up by 19.24% as of 4:49  a.m. ET on Friday. The trading volume of the digital asset shot up by 224.15%, and its market capitalization stood at $9.72 billion.




LINK skyrocketed from $13.57 to $16.58, outperforming all the cryptocurrencies ranking below it, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Toncoin (TON), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB).
The surge in LINK price can be attributed to the announcement of the partnership between DTCC and the decentralized Oracle network.
Chainlink and DTCC Partnership
As per a report from DTCC, the team of Chainlink and the world’s largest settlement system completed a pilot program that also involved some of the leading banking institutions in the United States and aimed to increase traditional finance fund tokenization.
The pilot program, known as the Smart NAV Pilot program, was initiated to standardize net asset value (NAV) data spread across various blockchain networks while utilizing Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).
The pilot program revealed that by delivering structured data on-chain and establishing standardized roles and processes, foundational data can be integrated into a variety of on-chain applications. The report stated that these applications include tokenized funds and ‘bulk consumer’ smart contracts, which manage data for multiple funds, while adding:
“This capability can support future industry exploration and can power numerous downstream use cases as well, such as brokerage portfolio applications. Additional benefits include real-time, more automated data dissemination and built-in access to historical data.”
Further, the DTCC pointed out that these capabilities might support numerous downstream applications, such as brokerage services, automated data dissemination, and improved access to historical data for funds.
The crypto community on social media platform X was buzzing with excitement with the new post from “DeFiMinty” stating that the Smart NAV pilot program could be a huge deal for Chainlink. While sharing future projections, the X user with more than 50,000 followers stated that large industries could begin tokenizing real-world assets and cross-chain protocols like CCIP could be used in chain abstraction.
In an extended report, the DTCC stated that it “invited asset managers, service providers, and distributors to a series of collaborative workshops to discuss the pilot and evaluate benefits”.
Notably, the prominent banking institutions that participated in the pilot program include American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust d/b/a American Trust Custody, State Street, and US Bank.

Hong Kong Crypto Hub Ambitions Stalled by Weak ETF Demand


							

Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs see muted investor interest, assets drop $25 million.



Trading volume lags far behind US counterparts, raising hub ambitions doubts.



Analysts cite US lead & China’s crypto stance as reasons for investor caution.




Hong Kong’s initial foray into Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has met with muted investor interest, according to a recent Bloomberg report. The total assets under management for the six ETFs launched in late April have fallen by roughly $25 million, down from an initial value of $293 million.



These figures fall short of the rosy predictions made by some Hong Kong asset managers. Prior to the launch, ChinaAMC executive Zhu Haokang anticipated that Hong Kong’s ETFs would surpass those in the U.S. in terms of initial listing size.



However, the reality proved significantly different. The total trading volume of Hong Kong’s ETFs on their first day was only 87.58 million Hong Kong dollars (roughly $12 million), a far cry from the $4.6 billion seen for US Bitcoin ETFs on their launch day. Analysts attribute this disparity to Hong Kong’s smaller financial sector and limited pool of investors compared to the U.S.









The lackluster performance of the ETFs raises questions about Hong Kong’s ambition to become a major crypto hub. Le Shi, Head of Trading at Market Making and Algorithmic trading firm Auros, believes Hong Kong’s approach has been “lukewarm.”




 “Firstly, they got beaten to the punch by the US. Secondly, there’s ongoing uncertainty about China’s intentions with regards to crypto, which is causing potential investors to tread carefully, or avoid the jurisdiction altogether.” 




He cites two key factors: the headstart enjoyed by the U.S. market, and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding China’s stance on cryptocurrencies, which is leading some investors to take a cautious approach.The latest data from Farside Investors confirms the trend of outflows, with the total now reaching $29.9 million. Bitcoin ETFs alone saw an outflow of $13.2 million as on May 16th.

One of the Most Popular Cryptocurrency Analysts Just Announced He's Selling All His Bitcoins - Here's Why - Bitcoin Sistemi


Famous cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe announced that he sold all his Bitcoins in a surprising move. Despite this, he maintains that he has not lost faith in BTC and does not believe it has reached its peak for this cycle.
Van de Poppe explained that the decision to sell all his Bitcoins was a strategic decision and he aims to obtain more Bitcoins later in the year. He noted that we are in a bull cycle and that the simplicity of the four-year cycle will diminish over time as Bitcoin matures as an asset.


Last week, pension funds, insurance companies and the largest hedge funds in the US reported allocating funds to the Spot Bitcoin ETF. CME Group also announced the upcoming launch of a futures ETF. According to the analyst, these developments show that Bitcoin is becoming a mature asset in the world.

Van de Poppe claims that this cycle is the last relatively easy one to make a lot of money through altcoins. He outlines four ways to generate high returns during a bull cycle for Bitcoin:






Selling Bitcoin at high levels and buying it back at low levels. According to the analyst, this strategy involves a lot of risk as timing can be difficult.
Using leverage to go long/short Bitcoin and get more Bitcoin by trading futures on the real asset.
Accumulate more Bitcoin by selling and earning income through labor outside (or within) the crypto ecosystem. According to the analyst, this is the easiest way to get more Bitcoin.
Trading altcoins within the Web 3.0 ecosystem to get more Bitcoin. According to the analyst, this is the riskiest way because timing the markets wrongly or investing at the wrong time can easily lead to losses.

Van de Poppe, a 31-year-old entrepreneur who has been on the market since 2017, announced that he chose the last option. He believes that in order to get a big return, one has to take risks against all odds and sensitivity. He admits there are times when things go bad, but he says he's willing to take risks.
Van de Poppe believes the world will focus on gaining as much Bitcoin and Gold as possible

We asked ChatGPT-4o to make a $1,000 crypto portfolio


The wider crypto market has been on a general uptrend since late 2024, with many cryptocurrencies hitting new all-time highs (ATH) or, at the very least, hitting prices not seen in years at one point or another.
So far, March has proven to be the cycle’s most exciting month given it featured a major meme coin rally and Bitcoin (BTC) at a new record high, while April – offering the BTC halving on the one hand, but also a correction and stagnation on the other – has arguably taken the second spot for crypto traders.
Given that, by mid-May, it appears as though the correction phase is over – most evidently seen by both Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) making a significant breakout attempt – Finbold decided to consult the most advanced model of OpenAI’s flagship artificial intelligence (AI) platform – ChatGPT-4o – to help design a strong portfolio for the future.

ChatGPT’s selects the $1,000 portfolio’s biggest holdings
Upon analyzing the recent crypto market happenings and being informed of its task to help allocate $1,000, ChatGPT set about designing what turned out to be an 8-cryptocurrency portfolio,
ChatGPT crypto portfolio summary. Source: Finbold
The biggest portion of the investment – $250 – went into Bitcoin, which the AI considers the ‘most established and widely recognized cryptocurrency’ and the ‘cornerstone of any crypto portfolio.’ ChatGPT particularly noted Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.
It is noteworthy, however, that though the AI used common arguments, certain aspects of Bitcoin’s reputation have arguably come into question given its performance following adverse geopolitical and financial events, as well as given the fact that its most recent rally started after positive inflation data came out for the first time in months.
The AI portfolio’s second biggest holding – at $200 allocated – turned out to be Ethereum, which ChatGPT described as ‘the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).’
The large language model (LLM) also explained that ETH’s smart contract capabilities and continuous upgrades are likely to only solidify its already dominant position.
ChatGPT’s third pick – at $150 – proved to be Solana (SOL) due to its ‘high transaction speeds and low fees’ and the fact that ‘it has a growing ecosystem and has seen significant adoption.’
ChatGPT explains the three biggest holdings. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT
ChatGPT designs the $100 club within the portfolio
The AI invested $100 into Binance Coin (BNB) given it is ‘integral to the Binance ecosystem’ and offers ‘utility in trading fee discounts and participating in token sales on Binance Launchpad.’ ChatGPT also explained that BNB’s strong liquidity in the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange ensures strong growth potential.
Cardano (ADA) also received a $100 investment and the AI explains it favors it due to ‘its strong emphasis on research-driven development and peer-reviewed protocols,’ as well as the ‘focus on scalability and sustainability.’
Polkadot (DOT) was the last cryptocurrency to receive a $100 investment from ChatGPT, with the AI justifying its decision by highlighting DOT’s interoperability and efforts to ‘enable different blockchains to transfer messages and value in a trust-free fashion.’
ChatGPT explains the intermediate holdings. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT
ChatGPT finalizes the portfolio
Finally, ChatGPT split the final $100 of the investment between Chainlink (LINK) and Avalanche (AVAX).
ChatGPT explains the final allocation. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT
According to the AI, Chainlink deserved its spot in the portfolio with ‘its critical role in the DeFi ecosystem and broad adoption’ given it functions as an oracle network.
Avalanche was described as highly competitive with a particular focus given to AVAX’s scalability and interoperability.

Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin (BTC) held steady above the $66,000 mark, reaching an intra-day high of $66,500. The Bitcoin price prediction now indicates strong bullish momentum, driven by increasing institutional interest. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has attracted significant investment, while CME Group’s planned entry into Bitcoin spot trading is expected to boost market liquidity and demand.
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) Shows Strong Institutional Interest

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has seen impressive performance since its inception. The trust has attracted significant attention, with 414 individual or institutional investors reported in the first few months. This level of interest is notable, as it’s uncommon for a new investment to have even 20 owners initially.
 Since its launch in January, IBIT has grown from zero to managing $16.65 billion in assets, making it the most popular Bitcoin investment for regular investors. Major firms such as Millennium Management, Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, and Aristeia Capital have invested in IBIT.

The rapid growth of IBIT to $16.65 billion in assets under management indicates strong institutional interest, which is positively impacting Bitcoin’s price.

Significant Attention: 414 investors in the first few months.
Rapid Growth: IBIT now manages $16.65 billion in assets.
Institutional Interest: Major firms like Millennium Management and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors are investors.

CME Group’s Entry into Bitcoin Spot Trading

CME Group, a major Chicago-based futures exchange, plans to enter Bitcoin spot trading due to growing demand, as reported by the Financial Times. The exact launch date is still uncertain, as the plan is being finalized. CME has a significant history in the crypto market, having introduced Bitcoin futures in December 2017 and micro-Bitcoin futures in May 2021 for smaller contracts.
Currently, CME leads in Bitcoin futures open interest with $9 billion and launched Bitcoin options in early 2020. However, it trails Deribit in options value. The demand for spot trading has surged, following the introduction of several spot ETFs earlier this year, with spot Bitcoin ETFs attracting $303 million in inflows on Wednesday.
Consequently, CME Group’s move into Bitcoin spot trading could positively impact Bitcoin’s price by increasing liquidity and institutional participation.

CME’s Entry: Plans to enter Bitcoin spot trading.
Market Leader: Leading in Bitcoin futures open interest with $9 billion.
Increased Demand: Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $303 million in inflows recently.

Institutional Investments in Bitcoin ETFs and Their Impact on Price

Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan is optimistic about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due to rising institutional investments, which have exceeded initial expectations. Recent data indicates over 900 professional firms now invest in Bitcoin ETFs, holding a combined $3.5 billion. This surge marks a significant development in the cryptocurrency market, showcasing growing institutional interest in Bitcoin.
Despite this growth, professional investors currently hold only 7–10% of total Bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM), indicating substantial potential for further expansion. Hougan noted that institutions typically follow a progressive investment trajectory, suggesting significant future allocations that could drive Bitcoin ETF growth and market participation.

Institutional Surge: Over 900 firms invest $3.5 billion in Bitcoin ETFs.
Growth Potential: Professional investors hold just 7–10% of Bitcoin ETF assets.
Future Allocations: Expected to further boost Bitcoin ETF growth and market activity.

Bitcoin Price Prediction

Bitcoin price prediction indicates a potential retracement after surpassing the $66,600 mark. Bitcoin has completed a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at around $64,750, which now serves as significant support and today’s pivot point. As long as Bitcoin stays above this level, a bullish rebound is likely.In this context, the immediate resistance is at the $66,600 level. Should Bitcoin break above this, the next resistance levels to watch are $67,820 and $69,000.Bitcoin Price PredictionOn the downside, if Bitcoin falls below the $64,750 support, it could drop further to $63,300. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the four-hour chart provides additional support around $63,150, enhancing the likelihood of a bullish bounce. However, if selling pressure increases and Bitcoin crosses below the 50-day EMA, further support levels are expected at $61,500 and $61,200.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved out of the overbought zone and is currently around 62, indicating continued bullish momentum.
Current Trend: Monitor the $64,750 and $63,300 levels closely, as they are critical for buyers. The likelihood of a bullish trend remains strong above these levels.

Farmsent to enhance smart farming with Nuklai AI tools as peaq raises $35M amid token launch

Nuklai, an on-chain smart data platform, and peaq, a layer-1 blockchain for decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs), have announced an integration aimed at enhancing AI and data monetization tools for DePINs, starting with the global Web3 marketplace for farmers, Farmsent.The news comes as peaq completed a token launch on Coinlist, raising $35 million from over 14,500 wallets in one of the largest campaigns the platform has seen in two years, which was oversubscribed by $15 million.The integration between Nuklai and peaq seeks to expand the array of AI and data tools available to DePINs on peaq. By leveraging Nuklai’s specialized smart data infrastructure, DePINs can enhance their solutions through quality datasets and industry insights while also benefiting from fair data monetization opportunities. Per Nuklai, the collaboration will harness data from over 400,000 devices, vehicles, machines, and robots within the peaq ecosystem, which bridges blockchain technology with real-world industries and economies.This partnership comes at a time when the number of IoT devices is projected to grow significantly, generating vast amounts of data. Nuklai aims to address this by consolidating the fragmented data landscape into an on-chain smart data ecosystem that emphasizes sharing, requesting, evaluating, and monetizing data. The platform’s transformation of raw data into high-quality smart data is intended to enhance its utility for AI models, benefiting enterprise clients by improving production efficiency and predictive analytics.Jochem Herber, Head of Ecosystem at Nuklai, stated that Nuklai will equip DePIN projects with the necessary tools to start monetizing or leveraging their data, positioning Nuklai as the primary AI layer for DePINs due to peaq’s established presence in this segment.A significant aspect of this integration is collaborating with Farmsent and consumer-facing businesses that use peaq IDs. Farmsent has over 160,000 farmers signed up for its middleman-free DePIN and marketplace ecosystem, which enhances data sharing and collaboration within the global food supply chain.Farmsent leverages blockchain technology to optimize the food supply chain. It streamlines the trading process and ensures food security by reducing intermediaries, lowering prices, and increasing transparency. With its decentralized product passports (DePPs), Farmsent records and verifies the journey of agricultural products, providing a transparent and tamper-proof record that empowers small farmers and builds consumer trust.The partnership with Nuklai is expected to enhance Farmsent’s capabilities by incorporating advanced AI tools to process and analyze agricultural data collected through sensors, human input, and third-party sources. Nuklai’s AI engine transforms this data into actionable insights, fostering a shareable data economy. This integration benefits Farmsent by providing valuable insights and contributes to a more data-driven agricultural future.According to Matthijs de Vries, Founder and CEO of Nuklai, the secure and seamless flow of reliable data is crucial for the IoT sector. Integrating peaq’s ecosystem of DePIN innovators is seen as a promising use case for Nuklai’s smart data infrastructure, which will help optimize processes and open new business opportunities.Till Wendler, co-founder of peaq, emphasized the synergy between AI and the Economy of Things, highlighting that Nuklai’s AI and data infrastructure layers add significant value to the ecosystem and unlock more tools for builders. The partnership is expected to provide mutual benefits, as the data collected by IoT devices and machines will be invaluable to Nuklai’s ecosystem of data users.As Farmsent continues to develop its blockchain-powered traceability system, the collaboration with Nuklai and peaq is set to further its mission of empowering small farmers, enhancing transparency, and optimizing the food supply chain. By integrating advanced AI and data monetization tools, Farmsent aims to revolutionize the agricultural sector and contribute to global food security.Latest Alpha Market Report

Crypto Trader Says Bitcoin Is out of the Post-Halving ‘Danger Zone’ - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								A cryptocurrency analyst and trader believes Bitcoin (BTC) is no longer at risk of a further market correction.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 76,900 YouTube subscribers that based on historic precedence Bitcoin has left the phase, or “danger zone,” when there is a likelihood of a dip below its range low after the halving event when miners’ rewards are cut in half.










“Essentially speaking, the danger zone, the post-halving danger zone, which is a three-week window where Bitcoin can produce downside volatility below its current reaccumulation range low, that danger zone is over. And that terror that occurs whenever we see downside volatility below the reaccumulation range low, that is also over. That terror is over. And the correction bottom is probably in.”
Source: Rekt/YouTube
Based on past cycles, the analyst believes Bitcoin is now in a reaccumulation phase when the digital asset tends to trade sideways.
“The reaccumulation phase that lies ahead is not over… this is a real accumulation phase right now. We’re probably going to be meandering between the range low and the range high, the $60,000 and $70,000 regions, just meandering here for the next coming weeks. As we’ve seen, this can be at least 150 days.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $65,364 at time of writing, down more than 1% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin ETFs Record Third Day Of Inflows, Price Tops $66,000


								In another remarkable day for cryptocurrency investments, US-based spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) witnessed a substantial influx of capital, totaling $257.3 million on Thursday. This significant inflow marks the third consecutive day of large-scale investments into these funds, signaling a robust and returning interest among institutional and retail investors alike in Bitcoin.
The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) reported a positive inflow of $4.6 million, continuing its upward trend for the second day. BlackRock, a major player in the investment arena, also saw a noteworthy resurgence in inflows, capturing $93.7 million after a stagnant three days. This development indicates a renewed confidence in Bitcoin from a variety of investor bases.
Other ETF providers also saw impressive inflows: Fidelity reported $67.1 million, Bitwise took in $1.4 million, ARK Invest added $62 million, Invesco received $6.2 million, Franklin saw $3.8 million and Valkyrie gained $18.5 million.

This sustained inflow trend across multiple providers underlines a collective bullish sentiment in the market. Renowned crypto analyst WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) highlighted the significance of these movements.
“Yesterday’s ETF flows by FarsideUK was entirely positive again for $257.3 million. […]. After the price going back to $66.500 on Wednesday, we had some consolidation and it’s now [above $66,000]. No other major news was announced, the fact that the price didn’t move with these inflows tells me that there is another party unloading in this range.”


Old Bitcoin ETF Debate Reignites
Amidst the inflow of excitement, a seasoned debate concerning the transparency and potential for market manipulation within the Bitcoin ETF ecosystem resurfaced yesterday. Tyler Durden, a pseudonymous crypto commentator, expressed concerns about the off-chain recording of Bitcoin transactions by large institutions like BlackRock.

“Blackrock can take as much Bitcoin as they want from Coinbase and the transaction is recorded off chain. I’d like to see all of the ETF’s wallets. […] This means they can borrow Bitcoin from Coinbase to short and are not required to show any proof they hold 1:1. There’s also a 2-30 day settlement. All settlements are done in cash. The writings on the wall, unless someone can find the ETFs wallets on-chain.”
Responding to these concerns, Dave Weisberger, chairman of CoinRoutes, defended the practices imposed by regulatory guidelines: “OF COURSE they had to do it that way because of the ‘cash creation/redemption’ the SEC forced. The Authorized Participants can’t ‘touch’ spot Bitcoin so MUST engage in off-chain transactions. As I said repeatedly, ‘in kind’ would have been more efficient & transparent, but this fear mongering is nonsense.”
Weisberger emphasized that the ETFs are required by their charter to hold full backing in spot Bitcoin for all settled shares, ensuring adherence to regulatory standards.
Moreover, James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF expert, also weighed in, supporting Weisberger’s perspective and hinting at the ongoing learning curve in the ETF industry regarding cryptocurrency transactions. “The gang learns about cash creation,” Seyffart said, “What a throwback to early December 2023. I pretty much agree with Dave here.”
At press time, BTC traded at $66,109.

French Regulator Reminds Public That Bybit Is On the "blacklist"


The French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) told cryptocurrency users and retail investors to be cautious with Bybit, asking the French to exercise “maximum vigilance” over the exchange.
The French regulator noted that Bybit has been on the blacklist since May 20, 2022, and is not authorized to offer cryptocurrency services in France.
France Remembers That Bybit Is On the Blacklist

The AMF recalled that providing digital asset custody services is subject to mandatory prior registration. It helps to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing and also imposes specific measures to protect retail investors.
However, according to the monetary and financial code, the AMF reserved the right to take legal action to block Bybit’s operation and website in France. The regulator invited users to “stay alert” if the exchange stops providing services in the country.
The announcement generated mixed opinions on X. Some appreciated the recommendations, while others questioned the AMF for “wanting to tell people where to invest their money.”

“Ok, so we’re going to have to go to even riskier platforms to guarantee our freedom to invest our hard-earned money as we wish, great protection. Create a secure and attractive platform that will be better for protecting us,” claimed a user on X.

France is not the only country where Bybit is unauthorized. Last year, the exchange exited Canada after increased due diligence orders from the Canadian Securities Administrators. In the United Kingdom, Bybit departed due to strict marketing rules enforced in October.

France: Bybit is not complying with the country's crypto regulation

Bybit, a well-known crypto exchange supported by the BitDAO ecosystem, was reported yesterday by the financial regulatory authority of France for non-compliance with registration requirements within the country.
The Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) had already included the exchange in its blacklist, but now it could request the platform to be blocked in France before a judge.
Let’s see everything in detail below.

Crypto and regulation in France: AMF warns investors about Bybit’s illegal activities
Tensions continue in Europe between the crypto world and various local regulations: Yesterday the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), the financial regulatory body of France, warned investors about the illegal presence of the exchange Bybit in the country.
The cryptocurrency exchange platform, despite having its operational headquarters in Dubai, provides its services to French users even though it is not registered as a digital asset service provider (PSAN).
The AMF had already included Bybit in the blacklist of unauthorized financial operators in May 2022, but now reports that the site may be closed upon formal request to a judge.
These are the words of the French regulator in a press release:
“Unregistered platforms that provide these services in France are illegal under French law. Bybit is not registered as a provider of digital asset services.”

We are not talking about testimonies related to possible defaults of the company or fraudulent activities, such as those carried out by FTX until its fateful collapse in November 2022, but simply of the omission of some registration obligations.
France does not actually prohibit the implementation of services related to the provision of digital asset custody services on behalf of third parties, or the purchase, sale, and exchange of cryptocurrencies, but requires prior approval from the PSAN.
According to the regulatory body, this type of registration allows to preserve public order through the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing, to verify the integrity and competence of leaders, and to impose specific measures to protect savers.
Recently the AMF has added more crypto platforms to its blacklist, such as 24cryptoforestrading.net and cryptoneyx.io, but at the same time has approved the registration for Gemini, Coinbase and Circle.
We remind you that Bybit, unlike other crypto exchanges such as Binace, Coinbase, Gemini Gate, BitPanda and Young Platform, is not even registered in the virtual operators register at OAM, and therefore would operate without authorization even in Italian territory.
Same situation for Bybit in Hong Kong, where the special administrative region has issued a notice similar to the one released by the French financial regulatory authority.
In 2023, the exchange founded by investor Ben Zhou was forced to leave the markets of Canada and the United Kingdom due to financial obligations and lack of regulatory control.
However, it is worth noting how Bybit is trying to expand its presence worldwide, where regulations appear less restrictive: recently it has indeed launched a trading service in the Netherlands and in Kazakhstan.
The reputation of Bybit in the cryptocurrency exchange sector
Despite not being registered with regulatory bodies in several countries around the world, Bybit remains a pillar in the cryptocurrency exchange sector.
Currently according to the data from Coinmarketcap, the platform in the last 24 hours records a spot trading volume of 3.7 billion and a derivatives volume of 16.9 billion dollars. On February 24, 2024, it set its record for trading volumes, processing orders for over 71 billion dollars.
With these numbers, Bybit undoubtedly ranks in the TOP 5 of the best cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, also being able to rely on a solid and efficient infrastructure, supported by none other than the multibillion-dollar autonomous organization BitDAO.
The CoinGlass analysis service ranks Bybit 3rd in the ranking of brokers with the most open interest on BTC and 2nd for open interest on ETH.
Overall, it has about 12 billion open positions in derivative markets.

The user interface is simple and intuitive, and the platform offers very interesting advanced features such as launchpad, OTC trading, copy trading, debit card, etc.
Bybit is present in 160 different countries and has a user base of almost 30 million with 1219 cryptocurrencies listed on its platform.
According to Dune Analytics, in April 2023 Bybit’s total reserves amounted to approximately 1.6 billion dollars, with 950 million in stablecoins, 350 million in ETH, and around 300 million in BIT and other tokens. In October 2021, these data reached a historical peak at 2.2 billion dollars.

Pink Drainer Shuts Down after Stealing Millions in Crypto | Coinspeaker



For cybercriminals, the loss of such a prolific tool is poised to disrupt their activities, at least, for now.

The notorious wallet drainer tool known as Pink Drainer has made a surprise announcement. This follows after several involvement in the theft of millions of dollars in crypto assets. According to a report by on-chain investigator ZachXBT, the developers of the cybercrime service shared their intent to wind down in a Telegram message.
They claimed that the decision to close down was simply because they had reached their goal and it was time for them to retire. They also added that the announcement will be the last message from them as there will be no future comebacks. Part of the statement reads:




“After this message’s publication, we will begin winding down all of our infrastructure. All stored information will be wiped and securely deleted.”
Pink Drainer Exits Leaving a Theft Trail of $85 Million
Pink Drainer has been a go-to vendor for cybercriminals in recent times. It offered a software tool designed to exploit technical vulnerabilities through social engineering tactics and phishing links.
With its tool, bad actors could carry out malicious schemes such as creating convincing phishing sites to deceive users into transactions that ultimately drained their wallets of crypto assets and NFTs.
Pink Drainer was also a part of a larger network of phishing-as-a-service platforms. Like its other counterparts including Monkey Drainer and Inferno Drainer, its developers also earned revenue from fees after taking an agreed percentage of whatever amount of asset is stolen.
Although the announcement has an undertone of sober reflections, it is worth noting that Pink Drainer has been linked to crypto theft worth nothing less than $85 million in the past year alone. According to ScamSniffer data, the use of Pink Drainer negatively impacted over 21,000 victims in the past year.
One of the most notable scams of the infamous wallet drainer happened in March 2024. The scam focused on creditors of bankrupt crypto firms through email phishing, leading to thefts of at least $5 million.
That March incident did not only show the tool’s ability to exploit high-profile vulnerabilities. It also highlighted the level of financial damage that the tool can inflict on any victim.
Implications for Cybersecurity and Future Threats
The shutdown of Pink Drainer is certainly a big win in an ongoing fight against cybercrime. For cybercriminals, the loss of such a prolific tool is poised to disrupt their activities, at least, for now. However, it must be noted that the threat remains, even as alternative phishing-as-a-service platforms continue to exist.

Turkey proposes aligning crypto legislation with international standards

The Turkish ruling party submitted a draft crypto bill to the parliament on May 16. The bill focuses on licensing and registration for crypto service providers and aligns with international standards. According to a Reuters report, the draft bill aims to update existing laws to comprehensively govern the cryptocurrency market. The bill’s key focus areas include consumer protection, platform transparency and compliance with financial regulations.The proposed legislation intends to regulate cryptocurrency trading platforms and other service providers in the sector, requiring them to obtain licenses from Turkey’s Capital Markets Board (CMB). Related: Turkey tops the world in stablecoin buying share vs. GDPThe draft law aims to govern crypto asset service providers, crypto asset platform operations, crypto asset storage, and crypto asset buying, selling and transfer transactions by Turkish residents. The legislation also addresses the classification of cryptocurrencies and projects, ensuring compliance with existing financial regulations. Some of the key takeaways from the bill are:Crypto service providers must be licensed and regulated by the Capital Markets Board.Enhanced CMB oversight to protect consumer assets and ensure effective dispute resolution.Mandatory revenue collection from crypto service providers by CMB and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey.Ban on foreign crypto brokers to foster a locally regulated ecosystem.This move seeks to align Turkey with international standards and address Financial Action Task Force (FATF) concerns, enhancing the security and reliability of the national crypto market.The draft law proposes to include the FATF-issued travel guidelines. The FATF Travel Rule requires cryptocurrency companies and financial institutions involved in digital asset sales — collectively known as virtual asset service providers (VASPs) — to obtain and share “accurate originator information and beneficiary information” with counterparty VASPs or other financial institutions before or during transactions.Turkey was demoted to the “gray list” by the FATF in October 2021 due to its failure to implement Anti-Money Laundering measures in its banking, real estate and other industries. The FATF requires countries on the gray list to actively cooperate in rectifying any shortcomings and subject them to heightened scrutiny.Magazine: CZ gets jail sentence, Gensler viewed Ether as security, and FBI targets mixers: Hodler’s Digest, April 28 – May 4

Assassin’s Creed Shadows Preview: Everything You Need to Know - Decrypt

“You’re still a frog in a well who knows nothing of the sea,” is one of the coolest lines we’ve heard in a reveal trailer this year.The next installment in the massive video game franchise Assassin’s Creed has just been announced, taking place in ancient Japan. It’ll see players control two contrasting characters with different fighting styles as their narratives clash.With the game releasing before the end of the year, fans of the series (including us) surely want to know everything about it. Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Here's everything we know so far about Assassin's Creed Shadows.(FYI: While Ubisoft is doing loads of stuff in the crypto gaming space, including Assassin's Creed NFTs tied to physical figurines, Assassin's Creed Shadows appears to be a traditional "Web2" game with no blockchain elements.)What is Assassin's Creed Shadows?Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the 14th installment in the Assassin's Creed series and the most recent since 2023’s Assassin's Creed Mirage—unless you include the VR title Assassin's Creed Nexus.Set in 16th century Japan, players will take control of two distinct characters which will adopt different gameplay styles—one being combat focused, the other stealth focused. When is Assassin's Creed Shadows coming out?Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Mac on November 15, 2024 at a price of $70 for the standard edition.Two special editions will also be available: the Gold and Ultimate Edition.The Gold Edition will allow you to play the game three days early, and comes with the season pass for $110. Meanwhile, the Ultimate Edition at $130 will come with additional character packs, skill points, and other in-game items.Alternatively, you can get the game on day one with subscription service Ubisoft+ at $18 a month.Who are the heroes in Assassin's Creed Shadows?Assassin’s Creed Shadows allows players to take control of a Japanese shinobi, Naoe, and a historical samurai, Yasuke. With early leaks showing that the main character of the new Assassin’s Creed game was going to be Black, some keyboard warriors weren't happy—calling Ubisoft woke. Yasuke, however, is a black man who actually existed in Japan during the 16th century. He's also featured in previous games from other companies.It is believed that Yasuke came from Mozambique, Ethiopia or Nigeria after being enslaved or trafficked as a child. He was later freed and traveled to Japan from India, where he was employed as a warrior by missionaries in the region. He is often referred to as the first black samurai, but some contest that he was ever given this title.As for Naoe, she is a fictional 17-year-old Japanese shinobi and is the daughter of one of the most iconic shinobi, Fujibayashi Nagato. She is described by Ubisoft as “intense, compassionate, and determined,” while Yasuke is a thoughtful, level-headed person.When and where is Assassin's Creed Shadows set?Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes place in 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era. This was an age of political unification that saw all of Japan’s provinces brought under one central government. This was not a peaceful process. Naoe lives in the province of Iga, the home of shinobi, or as many know them: ninjas. In the late 1,500s, the clan led by Oda Nobunaga attacked Iga twice—and in the second assault, Iga was defeated.Oda Nobunaga is one of the three great unifiers of Japan, an extremely powerful and controversial figure. Yasuke, who was fluent in Japanese, impressed Oda who then asked Yasuke to stay with him. In the trailer, Naoe sees Yasuke in the flames of Iga.The campaign will follow some historical reports of the story of Yasuke, but with some holes in our knowledge of the figure. Ubisoft has also added some “What if?” moments to the tale.“Given the time period of our game, unification is a really big deal,” Ubisoft Assistant Director of Cinematic Design Akim Milne said in a YouTube video.What will the gameplay be like?We currently do not have any gameplay footage of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. That said, the two characters are said to have distinct playstyles. Naoe as a shinobi will have a focus on stealth, while Yasuke as a samurai will be combat focused. While both share some abilities, there will be clear advantages when you stick to what your character knows.Other than that, we’ll have to wait to see a gameplay trailer to really understand how this game will play—though we imagine the broad strokes of the gameplay and world design will be familiar to what series fans already know and expect. Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to release on all next-gen platforms on November 15.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

This Project, which Updated on the Blockchain Network, Experienced a Significant Rise! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

FTM, the native token of the Fantom blockchain, has emerged as one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies, with a significant increase in value of 13% in the past week and 25 percent in the last 1 month.
Fantom Experienced a 13% Weekly Gain
FTM's price climbed to around $0.84 on positive market sentiment surrounding the release of Fantom's Sonic upgrade and a significant increase in the protocol's total value locked (TVL).


The Fantom Foundation is actively implementing its latest upgrade, codenamed Sonic, which promises to improve the capabilities of the blockchain. As of now, 25 out of 60 nodes have successfully completed the upgrade.
Once two-thirds of the nodes have implemented the new software, the chain will be fully upgraded. According to on-chain data, Sonic aims to significantly increase transaction speeds to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) with a precision of 1.1 seconds, compared to the previous average transaction speed of just over 2.5 TPS.





Investors are also responding positively to the recent increase in Fantom's TVL. Data from DeFiLlama shows that TVL on the Fantom network reached $203 million on May 16, up from $111 million just two days earlier.

This increase reflects a broader increase in TVL across various decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, yield aggregators, and other decentralized applications (dapps) on the Fantom chain.


Several dapps supporting the Phantom blockchain have experienced 10% to 20% growth in TVL over the past week, further adding to the overall value and appeal of the network.
This increase underscores the growing adoption and usage of the Fantom ecosystem, supported by its technological advances and advanced infrastructure.

Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) Explodes 700% Before Consolidating, As Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS), a Solana memecoin that was launched yesterday, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Diamond Paws presents a similar opportunity.



DIAPAWS rallied over 700% in the first few hours after its launch, before consolidating as some early buyers cashed out their profits.



However, most investors are still holding their tokens, as they are waiting for DIAPAWS to be listed on MEXC later this week, as this listing will cause the coin’s price to skyrocket.




Its current price presents a great opportunity for new investors to buy the dip before the next rally.



DIAPAWS has a market cap below $9,,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of around $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-3,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally another 12,000% in the coming two days, and Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, DIAPAWS can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for DIAPAWS by entering its contract address – HCEn3J1sKqMqPxrQDE33rGhJvyXh4r3YgyzD2wiAm3ga – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DIAPAWS.

pStake Finance Launches Bitcoin Liquid Staking Solution to Boost Bitcoin-Native DeFi Ecosystem



                    

pStake Finance, supported by Binance Labs, recently introduced its liquid staking solution for Bitcoin, marking a significant advancement in Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (DeFi). 



This new solution, developed on Babylon’s Bitcoin staking protocol, is designed to simplify the Bitcoin staking process while providing additional opportunities for Bitcoin holders to generate yields.




Mikhil Pandey, co-founder and chief strategy officer of pSTAKE Finance, emphasized the company’s commitment to enhancing Bitcoin’s functionality as a yield-generating asset. 



He stated, “Having fundamental faith and belief in Bitcoin, yields, and constantly identifying and solving crucial problems in this industry are some of the reasons behind moving in Bitcoin’s direction. 



The opportunity to make Bitcoin a yield-generating asset, something that hasn’t existed inherently, is very exciting. Yield-generating Bitcoin is powerful for all ecosystems and not just Bitcoin L2s.”



This initiative is part of the broader Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) movement, which seeks to integrate DeFi capabilities with the first blockchain network.

The growing interest in Bitcoin-native DeFi solutions has been bolstered by the 2024 halving event, which coincided with the launch of Bitcoin Runes, a new protocol for issuing fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network.



In the run-up to the halving, Binance Labs, the independent venture capital arm of Binance, has pivoted its focus towards BTCFi, marking its commitment with an investment in the Bitcoin-native restaking protocol BounceBit on April 11.




The launch of pSTAKE’s liquid staking solution represents the company’s inaugural venture into Bitcoin-native DeFi after three years of developing its protocol on the Cosmos network. pSTAKE is part of a growing number of protocols aimed at transforming Bitcoin into a yield-generating asset.



In a similar vein, Hermetica announced in early May the launch of the first-ever Bitcoin-backed synthetic U.S. dollar with yield capabilities, USDh, set to debut in June and offer up to 25% yields.




Pandey sees the BTCFi sector as an area ripe with promising products that enhance Bitcoin’s capital efficiency. 



He believes, however, that the sector still requires further development to reach the maturity seen in Ethereum’s DeFi space. “Ethereum’s tech had to go through a lot of evolution before the actual DeFi Summer in 2020. 



The Bitcoin DeFi landscape will likely follow a similar journey of development and progress before we see a full-fledged BTCfi Summer,” he explained.



Pandey also highlighted the significant financial potential in making Bitcoin a more versatile asset, noting the current minimal DeFi penetration in the Bitcoin market: “With less than 1% of the Bitcoin market cap in DeFi today, we could see huge growth as we develop more secure and reliable ways to generate yield on Bitcoin.”

Ethereum's Strong Position and Potential Growth: Coinbase Institutional Report | Cryptoglobe


                                
Coinbase Institutional is a division of Coinbase that caters to the needs of institutional investors, such as hedge funds, family offices, endowments, and other large-scale financial entities. It provides secure custody services through Coinbase Custody, offering segregated cold storage with robust security measures and insurance coverage. The division also offers advanced trading services via Coinbase Prime, which includes OTC trading and algorithmic trading solutions. 



Additionally, Coinbase Institutional delivers comprehensive research and analytics to help clients make informed investment decisions.

Emphasizing regulatory compliance, Coinbase Institutional adheres to strict standards to ensure a trustworthy and reliable service for its clients, aiming to provide a comprehensive and secure platform for institutional engagement in the digital asset market.



On 15 May 2024, David Han, a Research Analyst at Coinbase Institutional, published an insightful report titled “Monthly Outlook: Expectations on Ethereum.”



Han asserts that although Ethereum has underperformed so far this year, its long-term positioning remains robust. He believes that Ethereum has the potential to surprise investors with an upward trend later in the cycle. According to Han, Ethereum benefits from strong persistent demand drivers and possesses unique advantages in its scaling roadmap.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Han highlights that Ethereum’s historical trading patterns demonstrate its dual narrative as both a “store-of-value” and a “technology-token.” This combination, he suggests, contributes to Ethereum’s resilience and appeal in the cryptocurrency market. Han also points out that Ethereum does not face significant supply-side pressures such as token unlocks or miner sell-offs. Instead, the growth in staking and Layer 2 (L2) solutions has created substantial and growing sinks for ETH liquidity, which he views as a positive indicator.



Furthermore, Han emphasizes Ethereum’s central role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. He believes that Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi is unlikely to be challenged due to the widespread adoption of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and ongoing innovations in Layer 2 technologies. These developments ensure that Ethereum remains at the heart of DeFi, providing a strong foundation for future growth.



One of the critical points in Han’s report is the potential impact of spot US ETH ETFs. Han argues that the market may be underestimating the timing and likelihood of these ETFs being approved. He suggests that if approved by the U.S. SEC, these ETFs could significantly boost Ethereum’s market position, leading to positive price movements.

XRP Price: Community Hopes for Post-Lawsuit Surge


							

XRP price holds steady despite SEC lawsuit, down 0.3% in 24 hours



XRP community eyes lawsuit resolution, some predict price increase



XRP trading volume dips 10%, but market cap remains in top 7




The price of XRP token remained relatively stable on Friday, May 17, 2024, despite the lack of significant developments in the ongoing lawsuit with SEC. As of press time, XRP’s price is set at $0.5168, with a 24-hour decline of 0.30%.



The lawsuit, which began in December 2020, centers on whether XRP is a security. Investors are hopeful for a swift solution. While the parties have submitted the omnibus letter motions, the court ruled that Ripple, the SEC, and third parties must file opposing briefs by Monday (May 20). 



There are anticipations that XRP will surge to new all-time highs following the lawsuit’s final judgment. Analysts like King XRP forecasted the token’s major surge to $18.57 after the final judgment.



The broader XRP community is also looking ahead to potential future events, including the possibility of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) and increased adoption by financial institutions. These developments could further drive up the price, according to some analysts.



While there are no significant developments in the Ripple lawsuit today, the XRP token remains relatively stable. With negligible daily and weekly dips, XRP has seen a slight surge of 3.82% over the past month.









Despite the lack of daily or weekly price fluctuations, XRP’s trading volume has seen a notable decline of nearly 10% in the past 24 hours, currently sitting at $1.09 billion. This suggests a decrease in overall market activity. However, XRP maintains its position among the top seven cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, currently valued at approximately $28.5 billion.A recent uptick in XRP’s price of 2.5% coincided with Ripple’s CFO, Jonathan Bilich’s, public support for the company’s motion to seal its omnibus letter motions in the lawsuit. This price increase was accompanied by a surge in trading volume, indicating increased market activity around this news.

Reddit (RDDT) Stock Surges After Partnership with OpenAI Announced - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Reddit (NYSE: RDDT), the popular social news aggregation and discussion platform, has announced partnerships with two major players in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry this year: Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) in February and, more recently, OpenAI.



These agreements aim to enhance Reddit’s platform with AI-powered features and diversify its income sources beyond traditional advertising. The massive social media site will, in turn, help OpenAI and Google train their artificial intelligence models using the site’s data.



OpenAI Inks Partnership with Reddit 



In the latest development, Reddit has partnered with AI start-up OpenAI, granting the company access to Reddit’s vast content library for training its AI models.



Reddit will introduce AI-powered features on its platform, leveraging OpenAI’s cutting-edge technologies as part of the deal. The partnership follows OpenAI’s similar agreements with other publishers, such as the Associated Press and the Financial Times.





Reddit Made a Similar Deal with Google in February



Prior to the OpenAI deal, Reddit announced a partnership with Google in February, allowing the tech giant to access Reddit data to train its AI models. Both the OpenAI and Google partnerships have raised legal and copyright concerns as the EU and US examine whether using content to train AI tools constitutes copyright infringement or falls under fair use exceptions.After the OpenAI partnership announcement, Reddit, Inc. (RDDT) stock has experienced significant movement in the premarket trading session today at the time of writing. The stock closed at $56.38 on Thursday, down 5.45% from the previous close. However, pre-market trading showed a promising increase to $64.00, up 13.52%.



Reddit’s market cap currently stands at $9.219 billion, with revenue (TTM) of $883.25 million. Despite a significant net loss of $605.02 million and a negative profit margin of -68.50%, the company holds total cash of $1.67 billion and a low total debt/equity ratio of 1.37%. Analyst price targets for Reddit stock range from a low of $45.00 to a high of $65.00.







Will other sites like Reddit continue the trend of inking deals with companies to provide data for training large language models? Let us know in the comments below.

Top Crypto Trader Dumps Entire Bitcoin Portfolio To Buy Altcoins, But Should You Be Taking This 'Huge' Risk - Benzinga

Prominent cryptocurrency trader Michael van de Poppe stunned the market after he revealed dumping all of his Bitcoin BTC/USD holdings in favor of altcoins.What Happened: Known for sharing valuable inputs regarding cryptocurrency portfolios and picking the assets to invest, Van De Poppe disclosed in an X post, "I've sold all my Bitcoin."The big decision was not motivated by the King Crypto's weak price action over the last month, rather Van De Poppe remarked, "I didn't lose my faith in Bitcoin, I'm not expecting Bitcoin to be topped out for this cycle. I've not become a complete believer in Gold.Michael van de Poppe did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comment.The analyst stated that he was taking the stance opposite to most traders in the market who have been rotating capital from altcoins to Bitcoin, betting on the latter's continued rise. He emphasized that the ongoing cycle would be the last one to make money through altcoins, which he believed were due for an upside. As a result, he opted to acquire altcoins that were currently undervalued, so that when their prices jumps, he could use them to buy more Bitcoins.However, the analyst added a caveat that downside risk was ‘huge' as he was already down 20% on the overall portfolio when he posted this on X. Why It Matters: Bitcoin's dominance vis à vis the rest of the market has increased this year, rising from 50% at the beginning to 54.18% at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCapBitcoin has largely benefitted from the launch of spot ETFs this year, while other assets like Ethereum ETH/USD have underperformed in comparison.Another noted cryptocurrency analyst Kevin also noted substantial capital rotation from altcoins to Bitcoin in the current cycle. Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $66,333.56, up 0.05% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Michael Saylor Says Wall Street And Congress Want Bitcoin – But What About Joe BidenImage Via Shutterstock

Bitcoin (BTC) Whales Almost Disappear From Network, Here's Reason Why

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



As the most recent data provided by Santiment suggests, Bitcoin whales are currently distancing themselves from the market, with their activity plummeting towards 2024's lows. Unfortunately, it could be an indicator of an upcoming surge of selling pressure if BTC stays relatively neutral.While Bitcoin's 100+ BTC whale wallets continue to hold a high level of coins, totaling 11.79 million BTC, whale activity has dropped to its lowest level of 2024. There are currently 15,907 wallets holding at least 100 coins. Whenever the metric rises, we see a surge of renewed demand among whales, which should directly affect the performance of Bitcoin. Interestingly, the drop in whale activity could also be seen as a positive sign for the market. With fewer whales actively trading, the market might experience less volatility. When whales make large transactions, they can significantly impact the market, causing sudden price swings. Reduced activity among these large holders can lead to a more stable and predictable market environment, but this is not why people trade and hold cryptocurrencies.Additionally, less whale activity might indicate that these large holders are content with their current positions and are not looking to liquidate their holdings. This could suggest long-term bullish sentiment, as whales often have a better understanding of market dynamics and trends. Their decision to hold rather than sell might reflect their confidence in Bitcoin's future price growth.While the recent decline in Bitcoin whale activity to the lowest level of 2024 might initially seem concerning, it also offers some positive implications. Reduced market volatility and the potential for long-term holding among whales can provide a more stable environment for smaller investors.

Canaan Inc. Beats Revenue Expectations in Q1, Holds 1,057 BTC - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Canaan Inc. (NASDAQ: CAN) reported its unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2024, ending March 31. The company announced revenues of $35.1 million, exceeding its previous guidance of $33 million by 6%. Mining revenue saw a significant sequential increase of 182.1%, reaching $10.5 million. The company also achieved a milestone by surpassing 1,000 Bitcoins (BTC) held, ending the quarter with 1,057 Bitcoins. Net loss for the quarter was $39.4 million, narrowed by 71.7% sequentially and 53.3% year-over-year.



Canaan’s CEO, Mr. Nangeng Zhang, attributed the strong performance to strategic foresight and resilience, especially as the company navigated through the last full quarter before the Bitcoin halving. Despite the traditionally slow first quarter, Canaan delivered 3.4 million Thash/s of computing power sold, driving their mining revenue to impressive heights.



Introducing new A1566 mining machines and continued demand for the A14 series post-halving were also highlighted as key factors in their success. Zhang emphasized the company’s relentless sales efforts and the optimization of mining operations as central to their robust topline performance.



Canaan Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



When comparing the current quarter’s performance against expectations, Canaan outperformed significantly. The company had set a revenue guidance of $33 million but achieved $35.1 million, a 6% increase over their forecast. This strong revenue performance is particularly noteworthy given the expected earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter was -$0.2, while the actual EPS came in narrower, reflecting a net loss of $39.4 million. This narrowing of losses by 71.7% sequentially and 53.3% year-over-year indicates substantial progress in the company’s financial health.



The market had anticipated challenges for Canaan in the first quarter, given the traditional slow season and the imminent Bitcoin halving. However, the company exceeded these expectations, showcasing its ability to adapt and thrive under less-than-ideal conditions. The sequential growth in mining revenue by 182.1% and the increase in Bitcoins held to a record high further underscore Canaan’s robust operational capabilities and strategic execution.





Canaan Provides Optimistic Guidance for Upcoming Quarter



Looking ahead, Canaan provided guidance that reflects cautious optimism. The company expects continued growth in mining revenue and computing power sales, driven by the new A1566 mining machines and sustained demand for the A14 series. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. and Hong Kong markets, a record-high Bitcoin price, and the seamless completion of the fourth Bitcoin halving are positive industry developments that could bolster Canaan’s performance in the coming quarters.



The bullish cycle for Bitcoin, spurred by recent industry milestones, is expected to attract more investment and interest, providing Canaan opportunities to enhance its market position and financial results further.

1 Billion USDT Minted by Tether Treasury: Market Awaits Impact


Through its treasury, Tether, the issuer of USDT, has minted a significant amount of its stablecoin. On-chain data reveals that Tether Treasury minted 1 billion USDT on May 16, at 16:50 UTC.
Given Tether’s leading market position, many think this large USDT issuance could impact crypto market movements.
Tether’s Recent USDT Minting and Its Market Implications

Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, clarified the context of this substantial minting. He indicated that 1 billion USDT was added to the inventory on Tron Network, specifying that this was an authorized transaction not yet issued.

“Meaning that this amount will be used as inventory for next period issuance requests and chain swaps,” he added.

The last time Tether minted USDT was on April 16, when the market experienced a liquidity drain. According to a report from the on-chain analytical platform Lookonchain, Tether Treasury has minted 31 billion USDT in the past year. It minted those amounts on the TRON and Ethereum blockchains.
Interestingly, Tether minted these USDT when Bitcoin’s (BTC) price corrected to the $64,600 range. Since the end of 2022, each increase in the USDT supply has commonly had a positive effect on the development of the Bitcoin price.

Data from CryptoQuant reveals a high correlation between USDT supply and Bitcoin price movement, leading to an increase in volume and a dynamic environment for the Bitcoin price. Therefore, this sparks speculation among the crypto community that the new funds might be used to push Bitcoin’s price. Moreover, Lookonchain’s report indicated that the minted USDT last year pushed Bitcoin to reach above the $70,000 range.


“These minted USDT drove the price of BTC from $27,000 to $73,000,” it wrote.

Despite this speculation, Bitcoin’s price has stabilized between $64,000 and $66,000 in the last 24 hours. Last week, BTC fluctuated between $60,000 and $62,000 until the release of US inflation data. BeInCrypto reported a jump in Bitcoin’s price from $62,000 to $66,000 after April’s inflation data release suggests inflation might be slowing.

Bitcoin Price to New ATH Is Inevitable as US Congress Supports Banks’ Crypto Adoption | Coinspeaker



New Bitcoin addresses have been shrinking in the recent past, an indication more users are opting to tap on spot BTC ETFs for easier liquidity and enhanced security.

Bitcoin (BTC) price continued with the recent bullish outlook on Friday during the early London session. The flagship coin traded around $66,410 at the time of this writing, thus suggesting the bulls are ready to pump to a new all-time high soon. Moreover, Bitcoin price has consistently closed above the 50 daily Moving Average in the past three days, after being trapped in a crypto correction mode for the past two months.
Bitcoin Whales Anticipate New High Soon
According to on-chain data from market intelligence platform Santiment, there are currently 15,907 Bitcoin wallets holding at least 100 coins. Remarkably, Bitcoin whales hold a whopping 11.79 million coins, amid declining balances on centralized exchanges.




As Coinspeaker explained, the trading volume of US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs has surged in the recent past with notable cash inflows. Furthermore, Grayscale’s GBTC has significantly reduced its daily Bitcoin sell-offs. According to first-quarter earnings reports, 937 financial institutions purchased Bitcoins through the recently approved spot BTC ETFs.
On Thursday, the United States Senate unanimously approved the CRA that overturned SAB 121, which mandated banks from holding clients’ crypto assets. Interestingly both sides of the political spectrum came together on the issue, thus indicating heightened interest and demand for digital assets in the United States.
“The Senate passing a CRA overturning SAB 121 is a win for financial innovation and a clear rebuke of the way the Biden admin and Gary Gensler have persecuted crypto. It also marks the 1st time Congress has passed standalone crypto legislation. We are just getting started,” US Senator from Wyoming, Cynthia Lummis, noted.
According to US House majority whip, Tom Emmer, President Joe Biden is under immense spotlight if he will approve or veto the CRA ahead of the upcoming elections. The US Congress has shown its disapproval of Gary Gensler’s decision to crack down on crypto projects, while other countries are adopting the web3 industry.


Midterm BTC Price Targets
Bitcoin price is well bolstered from a technical and fundamental point of view to rally further in the coming months. Less than a month since the fourth Bitcoin halving event and the underlying value has been retesting 2021’s all-time high, thus suggesting a super cycle at hand.


According to a popular crypto analyst alias Captain Faibik, Bitcoin price has been forming a bullish pennant flag pattern. As a result, the crypto analyst believes Bitcoin price will reach $86K soon, which also coincides with the 2.618 daily Fibonacci Extension.
However, the crypto analyst highlighted that Bitcoin price must consistently close above $68K in the coming weeks to validate the bullish uptrend.

We asked ChatGPT-4o what’s the best cryptocurrency for the gaming industry


The gaming industry reached $184 billion in revenue last year, and forecasts expect it to reach $200 billion by 2024. Finbold then asked ChatGPT-4o which cryptocurrency would best meet the demand for game-related payments, with the potential to embrace this market.
Notably, ChatGPT-4o is OpenAi‘s most recent update and advanced model for an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot. It has proven more accurate, faster, and cheaper than other models in the industry—becoming a favorite for efficient insights.
From a similar perspective, we asked the AI as follows:



“Which cryptocurrency is best for the gaming industry to adopt and implement for in-game and off-game payments and transactions, considering each cryptocurrency’s attributes (e.g., fees, time to finality or settlement, ease of use, ease of implementation, open-source, etc)? I want the objectively best tool for peer-to-peer digital money, not necessarily the most popular one, with the higher scores for these attributes. Justify your answer.”

ChatGPT-4o: Nano (XNO) is the best cryptocurrency for the gaming industry
As a result, ChatGPT-4o named Nano (XNO) the best cryptocurrency for the gaming industry to adopt and implement for in-game and off-game payments, considering the objective criteria.
In particular, the AI mentions Nano’s zero fees as ideal for micro-transactions, preventing players and developers from accumulating significant costs. Moreover, ChatGPT-4o judges Nano’s nearly instantaneous transaction finality as crucial for a seamless gaming experience, avoiding gameplay disruptions.
The block-lattice structure stands out among other blockchain competitors, being “relatively simple and efficient,” reducing integration complexity to gaming platforms. Additionally, Nano benefits from community-driven innovation and code transparency as open-source software, resulting in robust and secure applications.

Popular cryptocurrency alternatives for the gaming industry
However, XNO is still a low-cap cryptocurrency with around $150 million in market cap. On one side, this relatively small capitalization could offer an investment opportunity in case Nano embraces even a small share of the gaming industry’s financial volume, converted in demand and, thus, price appreciation.
Conversely, it also means that the so-far lack of market validation could become a competitive disadvantage against more popular cryptocurrencies. Finbold then asked ChatGPT-4o artificial intelligence for the three most popular alternatives, and the AI traced a comparison.
As a result, it mentioned Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and BNB Chain (BNB) as the most popular cryptocurrencies for gaming. Nevertheless, the final verdict was that XNO is still “the best cryptocurrency for the gaming industry to adopt.”

Current Nano adoption and gaming industry revenue
Interestingly, XNO has recently trended on Santiment‘s social feed due to a gaming platform adding Nano as an in-game payment. The SanBase Pro‘s AI summary highlighted Nano’s instant and fee-free transactions as “particularly appealing for the gaming industry.”

Wodo, the aforementioned gaming platform, demonstrated these attributes in a video, with a player collecting XNO in-game.

VIDEO

Conclusion and market analysis
In summary, the $184 billion gaming industry—as reported by Newzoo—could benefit from adopting Nano for payments, according to ChatGPT-4o AI’s objective analysis.
Therefore, even a small share of this market could drastically increase the market demand for the fully diluted $150 million XNO, potentially affecting its price and rewarding the coin’s early adopters and ecosystem.

As of this writing, XNO trades at $1.20 in the spot market, up 2% in the last seven days.

Sell Alert: Bitcoin faces imminent correction


After months of enthusiasm about a potential rally to unprecedented highs toward $100,000 or – according to some prominent investors – toward $300,000, building up in the wake of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approval, a new record value near $73,000, and the halving event in April, Bitcoin (BTC) price movement turned relatively stagnant and even threatened a collapse in early May.
By the middle of the month – and particularly after the latest CPI report came out lower than was feared – the world’s premier cryptocurrency again took off, gaining nearly 5% in a week and surging from a low near $60,000 to a press time price of $66,357.

While many traders are hopeful the rally signals an end to the crypto market’s stagnant phase and a full return to the bull cycle, technical analysis (TA) analysis reveals that it may not be just smooth sailing ahead.


TD Sequential warns of imminent BTC correction
Shortly after the most recent Bitcoin rally gained steam, Ali Martinez, a prominent crypto analyst, shared in X that the world’s premier cryptocurrency may be facing an imminent correction.
TD Sequential, a common technical analysis tool designed to detect the timing of a trend reversal of confirmation by analyzing an asset’s earlier performance over a set time frame, issued a strong sell signal on Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart, per the expert.

Martinez also added that the correction is likely to unfold over between one and four candlesticks.
Bitcoin price chart
Though technical analysis may indicate a price drop, Bitcoin has, in the recent past, experienced a significant surge. 
Indeed, after undergoing a period of consolidation and heightened volatility paired with mostly sideways trading, the coin has reentered the rally that has seen it rise 54.46% since the start of 2024.

Though BTC is yet to reclaim the highs reached in March, the most recent surge has enabled the cryptocurrency to erase the losses of early May, and Bitcoin is – having risen 5.73% in the 30-day chart – very close to its highs from April 22.

sUSD Lost Its Stability to $1, This Altcoin Price Reacted! - Bitcoin Sistemi


A new one has been added to the depeg (stablecoin losing its peg to $1) events, which have been increasing in number recently in the cryptocurrency market.
Synthetix's decentralized stablecoin sUSD lost its peg to the dollar and fell below $1, The Block reported.


This decline was due to increased selling on decentralized exchanges, with sUSD falling below the stable price of $1 to as low as $0.92.
sUSD price later recovered to $0.96.





Chaos Labs, risk manager for the Aave lending protocol, stated that the depeg on sUSD was triggered by a withdrawal from the sBTC/wBTC liquidity pool by a major liquidity provider on the Curve decentralized exchange.
As the user continued to sell sUSD, it caused the price to drop to as low as $0.92.


The depeg experienced in sUSD was also reflected in the price of Synthetix (SNX). At this point, the SNX price, which has fallen in recent hours, continues to trade at $ 2.67.

Pro-XRP Lawyer Outlines Reason Behind Senate Seat Campaign - Here's What It Is | Bitcoinist.com


								Pro-XRP attorney and well-known cryptocurrency supporter John E. Deaton has disclosed the primary motivation for his Senate run in the United States, highlighting the critical need for improved protections for citizens and retail investors. Deaton, who rose to fame for his outspoken criticism of regulatory overreach and steadfast support of XRP, feels that the legislative framework now in place under US Senator Elizabeth Warren is insufficient to protect common investors in the quickly developing digital asset market.
Pro-XRP Lawyer Blasts Elizabeth Warren
According to John E. Deaton, US Senator Elizabeth Warren has failed to deliver a safe environment for working families, retail investors, and consumers during her tenure. Warren’s failure to protect these people in the same manner that she does for the disgraced Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chairman Martin Gruenberg is the major reason why the pro-XRP lawyer is running for the US Senate seat.

In a scathing report published on May 7, it was found the FDIC, under the management of Gruenberg, committed pervasive sexual harassment, bullying, and discrimination. 
The report read:
As detailed in the report, the independent review found that, for far too many employees and for far too long, the FDIC has failed to provide a workplace safe from sexual harassment, discrimination, and other interpersonal misconduct. It further found that management’s responses to allegations of misconduct, as well as the culture and conditions that gave rise to them, have been insufficient and ineffective.
The independent investigation included specific examples of managers sending their staff members pictures of themselves naked or taking them to brothels while on business vacations.
About 10% of the workforce reported these incidents or other instances of personal wrongdoing at the firm, including Gruenberg’s own actions. Despite the embarrassing report, Gruenberg, who has been working with the firm since 2005, is still unwilling to step down as the company’s head. 
Warren has allegedly been supporting the FDIC chair, as Deaton noted that following Greunberg’s nomination by US President Joe Biden, Warren expressed her approval of the decision, basically advocating Gruenberg as a champion for customers.
During the vote which was between Martin Gruenberg and Adrienne Harris, Warren voted in favor of Gruenberg. She said that Harris is too moderate on cryptocurrency and that Gruenberg is a radical, calling Harris a savvy centrist.
Also, it is noteworthy that since the allegations, Warren has reportedly been spearheading an effort to keep Gruenberg safe behind closed doors. Her efforts allegedly aided the FDIC Chair in preparing for this week’s congressional hearings, where he was expected to face intense questioning about the claims.
Political Agenda Over Transparency
So far, the pro-XRP attorney has slammed Warren, claiming that the US Senator lacks proper leadership qualities. “Leadership is about accepting that sometimes you get it wrong and sometimes, you support the wrong person,” he stated.

By supporting Gruenberg, Deaton believes that Warren once again prioritized her political goal over acting honorably and morally by safeguarding these workers. 
In addition, rather than owning up to her error and calling Gruenberg’s registration, she is aiding him. As a result, Deaton highlights the Senator’s action as another instance of her selective outrage and hypocrisy.

Market watch: Bitcoin, Ethereum traders on the spot with $2.13B options expiry - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin maintained a balanced Put/Call Ratio ahead of the deadline
ETH traders face potential losses as its price was close to the maximum pain point

According to data from Deribit, the market-leading derivatives exchange, Bitcoin [BTC] options with a notional value of $1.18 billion will expire on 17 May.
Also, Ethereum [ETH] contracts, valued at $950 million, would expire on the same day. At press time, the Put/Call Ratio for Bitcoin was 0.61 while the maximum pain point was $62,500.
Source: Deribit
Where do both BTC and ETH stand?
In trading options, a put means that a trader has placed a position to place a contract up for sale. In this case, the expectation is that the price of the asset decreases so the position can make gains.
On the other hand, a call implies a purchase, indicating that the bet is for a price hike. If the reading of the Put/Call Ratio is 0.70 and above, it means that traders are buying more puts than calls.
Conversely, a reading of 0.50 and below implies a bullish sentiment in the market. For Bitcoin, the ratio revealed that the number of put and call positions was close, indicating a balance between bearish and bullish positions.
For ETH, the Put/Call Ratio was 0.21 – A sign that most of the bets were bullish. ETH had a maximum pain point of $3,000. If the cryptocurrency trades at this level or below by the end of the day, a lot of traders might face huge financial losses.
Source: Deribit
It would be the same for Bitcoin if the price hits $62,500 or drops below it. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin was $66,443, indicating that it might be difficult for the crypto to cause a lot of pain.
However, at the same time, ETH was valued at $3,018. The closeness of this to the maximum pain point leaves ETH traders at a big risk of losing.
ETH’s weakness has not deterred future bets
In addition, Greeks.live, an options trading repository, commented on the matter. The handle agreed with AMBCrypto’s analysis for Bitcoin via X. For Ethereum, it noted,
“Btc is more balanced between long and short, while the ETH price is weak leading to continued weakening of the market confidence, and selling calls have become the absolute main deal.”
However, data from Deribit revealed that traders expect ETH to recover from its struggles going forward. Based on AMBCrypto’s observations, there has been an increase in bets targeting $3,600 between the last week of May and June.
One of the reasons for this prediction could be the looming SEC decision on the numerous Ethereum ETF applications. A nod on this front could drive ETH’s price higher, and traders might gain from the same.

Realistic or not, here’s ETH’s market cap in BTC terms

 
On the other hand, delay or rejection could force the price of the altcoin further lower. Should this be the case, traders might have to deal with huge financial losses.

Major lending protocol hit by $20M hack; Bitcoin DeFi tool loses $4.3M


In a series of alarming incidents, two prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, Sonne Finance, and ALEX Lab, have been targeted by sophisticated hacks, resulting in a combined loss of $24.3 million in cryptocurrencies.
Sonne Finance halted operations after a $20 million exploit, while ALEX Lab lost $4.3 million due to a suspected private key compromise. Both platforms are now in a race to recover their stolen assets and prevent future breaches.
Sonne Finance: $20 million heist
Lending protocol Sonne Finance was forced to pause operations after suffering a hack that drained $20 million worth of cryptocurrencies from the market. 


The attack, which targeted Sonne Finance’s USD Coin (USDC) and Wrapped Ether (WETH) contracts, was detected on May 14 by Web3 security firm Cyvers.

Sonne Finance announced the suspension of all markets on the Optimism (OP) blockchain to mitigate further damage. Partnering with Cyvers, the protocol is actively investigating the breach and exploring options to recover the stolen funds, including negotiating a bug bounty with the hacker. ‘
However, blockchain investigator PeckShield reported that the hacker has already moved a substantial portion of the loot ($7.8 million) to a new wallet address.

The hacker then swapped 59 Wrapped BTC (WBTC) for roughly 1,185 Ether (ETH) and 183,000 Dai (DAI), indicating an intent to use a privacy protocol like Tornado Cash to obscure the transaction trail.
Details of the exploit
According to the incident analysis by Certik ,the attack exploited a known bug in Sonne’s Compound v2 forks via a donation attack, manipulating the platform’s exchange rates by donating large amounts of cryptocurrency. 
This manipulation tricked the system into overestimating its collateral, allowing the hacker to siphon off millions. Blockexplorer data showed the attacker transferred millions of VELO, ETH , USDC following the manipulation, later converting these to $8 million in Bitcoin and Ether.
The SONNE token has since plummeted by 60%, drastically reducing its market cap to $20 million, even though developers managed to prevent an additional $6.5 million from being siphoned off once the attack was identified.
ALEX Lab: $4.3 million compromise
Simultaneously, ALEX Lab, a Bitcoin DeFi tool, was drained of over $4.3 million in various tokens due to a suspected private key compromise. Security researchers from CertiK revealed that the attackers likely obtained a private key controlling ALEX’s XLink bridge, a service facilitating token transfers between different blockchains.

The breach resulted in the loss of over $300,000 worth of Bitcoin, $3.3 million in stablecoins, and $75,000 in Sugar Kingdom (SKO) tokens. 
ALEX developers confirmed the hack and claimed they knew the attacker’s identity, offering a 10% bounty for the return of 90% of the stolen funds. Major exchanges have since frozen funds associated with the hacker to prevent further misuse.
The recent hacks on Sonne Finance and ALEX Lab highlight the persistent security challenges facing DeFi platforms. 
As these platforms work to recover stolen assets and enhance their security frameworks, the incidents serve as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.

$FLOKI Price Is Up 471% So Far in 2024: Does This Year’s Rally Have Staying Power? | Cryptoglobe


                                
Floki ($FLOKI) began as a meme-inspired cryptocurrency based on Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, rapidly transforming into a comprehensive ecosystem supported by a passionate community. It blends meme culture with real-world utility, distinguishing itself in the crypto space. Central to Floki’s ecosystem is Valhalla, an NFT gaming metaverse that offers battles, asset trading, and collection opportunities, allowing users to earn rewards. FlokiFi extends into decentralized finance (DeFi), providing tools for staking and asset locking, with plans to expand its DeFi offerings. Additionally, Floki University educates users on crypto and blockchain technology.



FlokiPlaces enhances the ecosystem by serving as a marketplace for NFTs and merchandise, emphasizing the project’s utility beyond its meme coin origins. Floki’s dedication to philanthropy and partnerships highlights its mission to position the FLOKI token as a positive force in the cryptocurrency world alongside its strategic development.



The FLOKI token operates on both the Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Chain (BNB) blockchains, providing a multi-chain presence that offers users versatility in accessing various decentralized applications and services across these platforms.



FLOKI is currently trading at $0.0002092, down 1.6% in the past 24-hour period. It recorded a 24-hour trading volume of $288 million, with a market capitalization of $2.02 billion, securing 59th position in the market. Although the FLOKI token reached an all-time high of $0.0003365 on November 4, 2021, it has since dropped by 37.8%. However, this year, the FLOKI price has increased by over 471%.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

In March, the Floki team unveiled an ambitious roadmap for 2024, aiming to establish FLOKI as the world’s most recognized and utilized cryptocurrency. Leveraging its meme appeal, robust community, aggressive marketing strategies, and practical utility, Floki is positioning itself for significant developments in the crypto space.



Key Developments and Phases:



Phase 1 Initiatives: Floki is expanding its presence on Venus, a leading lending protocol on the BNB chain, by seeking integration into the Venus Core Pool. This move is expected to provide Floki holders with deeper liquidity and broader borrowing options using their tokens as collateral. Additionally, Floki is integrating Venus markets into its user interface, simplifying access to liquidity. The introduction of Floki Debit Cards and the launch of the initial version of the University of Floki are also on the horizon. The University will offer free asynchronous courses on crypto topics, empowering users with knowledge about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.



Phase 2 Expansions: The launch of a cross-chain trading bot will facilitate buying and selling across major blockchains, enhancing the utility and deflationary nature of the $FLOKI token. Floki is also stepping into the domain name and decentralized website service, allowing users to create .floki domain names and host decentralized websites, promoting wider adoption of the ecosystem. In a significant fintech partnership, Floki-powered bank accounts will be introduced, enabling users to fund digital bank accounts with $FLOKI tokens, further broadening the token’s utility and accessibility.



Phase 3 Upgrades: The University of Floki will receive an upgrade to include more advanced features, premium courses, and a referral program, with payments primarily in $FLOKI tokens. Additionally, FlokiFi Locker will see a V3 upgrade, and a new Staking-as-a-Service program will be launched, aiming to become a leading solution for community engagement and token holder incentives.



Phase 4 Launches: The public release of Valhalla’s mainnet, including a version tailored for the Chinese market, marks a critical step in Floki’s journey. The game, featuring on-chain mechanics and PlayToEarn economics, is poised to reach a broader audience with the subsequent launch of a mobile app for both iOS and Android devices, driven by strong user demand.

Customer Sues Dolce & Gabbana Over Delayed NFT Delivery and 97% Drop in Value - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Luke Brown, a disgruntled customer, has filed a class-action lawsuit against Dolce & Gabbana USA Inc. and NFT marketplace UNXD in the US District Court, Southern District of New York. The case, numbered 24-cv-03807, alleges that the defendants failed to deliver promised products and abandoned the project, resulting in significant financial losses for Brown and other affected customers.



Disgruntled Customer Sues Fashion Firm Over Botched NFT Delivery



Brown claims to have spent $6,000 on DGFamily NFTs, which he alleges have lost 97% of their value, approximately $5,800, due to the defendants’ actions. The complaint states that the NFTs and associated benefits were delivered late. The promised digital outfits were delayed by 20 days, and usability was delayed an additional 11 days due to a lack of platform approval. As a result, the NFTs’ value dropped significantly. The law firm representing Brown has issued a statement alleging a pattern of promising and failing to deliver products, followed by abandoning the project and community.





What are DGFamily NFTs?



DGFamily NFTs were announced in February 2022 and released during the first Metaverse Fashion Week in March 2022, hosted by Decentraland in partnership with UNXD. The collection showcased 20 bespoke metaverse wearables designed to celebrate creativity and innovation in the metaverse. These NFTs were available exclusively to DGFamily Box holders and aimed to embody the unique DGDNA 3.0, transcending reality and the metaverse.



Holders of DGFamily NFTs were promised benefits such as access to exclusive drops, invitations to physical and digital events, collaboration opportunities, and more. However, the alleged delays and abandonment of the project have left many customers, like Brown, feeling misled and seeking legal recourse.



The impact of this case extends beyond Brown, as it has been filed as a class-action lawsuit on behalf of other affected customers. The outcome of this legal battle could set a precedent for the responsibilities and obligations of firms that dipped into NFTs and the metaverse.







Do you think buying NFTs in the current market condition is a good move? Let us know in the comments below.

‘It’s Over for Memecoins’: Trader Who Nailed 2022 Crypto Bottom Turns Bearish on dogwifhat and Pepe - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								A trader known for making accurate crypto calls is suddenly turning bearish on memecoins.
Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 550,400 followers on the social media platform X that memecoin projects could suddenly collapse.










“I’m personally convinced it’s over for memes, rest of the market might get out of this ok but I’m expecting memes to giga rug (gigantic rug pull). Good luck if your portfolio is in the 10th iteration of a dog or a cat.” 
Zeroing in on specific memecoins, the analyst warns that Pepe (PEPE) could plummet to a range low if it fails to hold as support the $0.00000998 level on the daily chart.
“PEPE: decent breakout, technically bullish as long as it holds. If it fails and breaks back in the range, I’ll be shorting it targeting range lows. Prefer WIF but might spread my bets.”
Source: DonAlt/X
Pepe is trading for $0.00001004 at time of writing, down 4.5% in the last 24 hours.
The analyst also says memecoin dogwifhat (WIF) could plummet to around the range low of $2.23 if it fails to flip into support the range high of $3.15.
“WIF: actively looking to short the range high. Target somewhere below the range low. Wrong if the range is broken properly.”
Source: DonAlt/X
WIF is trading for $2.83, down 7.6% in the last 24 hours.
The analyst also lists several of his reasons for being bearish on memecoins.
“Reasons for why I’m bearish memes: 

There are infinite memes already.
Every day there are thousands more.
Bunch of people bought into the GME-meme rotation narrative (which is beyond retarded in my opinion).
Charts don’t look so good across the board.
Sentiment is heavily skewed bull.”

JPMorgan Raises Bitcoin Mining Cost Estimate to $45,000


							

JPMorgan raises Bitcoin production cost to $45,000.



Slower hashrate decline after halving event impacts cost.



Long-term cost expected to trend closer to $42,000.




JPMorgan analysts have revised their estimate for the cost of producing one bitcoin to $45,000, citing recent changes in the Bitcoin mining hashrate. This update comes after the quadrennial halving event, which reduced the block reward for miners by 50%. Previously, the bank’s analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, projected a production cost of $42,000. However, they now acknowledge that ongoing adjustments in hashrate and mining efficiency have necessitated a revision.







JPMorgan initially anticipated a significant decline in hashrate following the halving. This decrease was expected as miners with less efficient equipment would become unprofitable and exit the network. However, the actual decline in hashrate has been more gradual than anticipated. Consequently, the current hashrate and power consumption levels suggest a higher central estimate for the production cost, currently set at $45,000.  Despite this upward revision, the analysts maintain their medium-term price target of $42,000 for production costs.



Mr. Panigirtzoglou emphasized the dynamic nature of production costs, which are influenced by both hashrate and mining equipment efficiency.  The current $45,000 estimate is subject to change as the network adjusts to the post-halving environment. The team expects the production cost to trend closer to the $42,000 mark once the hashrate stabilizes and mining efficiency improves.



The recent launch of the Bitcoin Runes protocol provided a temporary boost to transaction fees, offering miners some relief after the halving. However, this increase proved short-lived, with user activity and Runes-related fees dropping significantly in recent weeks. This highlights the ongoing challenge for Bitcoin miners in securing stable revenue streams, particularly in the post-halving environment.



A decline in power consumption exceeding the hashrate decrease suggests an exodus of less efficient miners.  The analysts view this  as a natural feedback loop tied to Bitcoin prices. When the price falls, unprofitable miners are forced to leave the network, leading to a reduction in overall computing power for mining. This, in turn, contributes to a lower cost of bitcoin production. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $65,634.85, with a slight decline of 0.15% over the past 24 hours.









The revised production cost estimate by JPMorgan underscores the intricate relationship between Bitcoin mining and market dynamics. While the short-term cost may be slightly higher than previously anticipated, analysts believe long-term efficiency improvements will eventually bring it closer to their initial projection. The success of Bitcoin as a digital asset hinges on the ability of its mining ecosystem to adapt and evolve alongside market fluctuations.

                        The XRP price has gained by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, rising to $0.5209 on a day when the crypto market as a whole has risen by the same percentage.XRP is now up by 1% in a week and by 3.5% in the last 30 days, with the major alt also sitting on a modest 16% increase in the past year.This pales in comparison to the returns posted by other major tokens in the past 12 months (e.g. BTC, ETH, SOL), yet it also raises the possibility that XRP could compensate by enjoying some above-average gains later in the year.And with Ripple’s MD for the Middle East and Africa revealing in a talk that the firm plans to expand deeper into the region, the XRP price could see sustained rallies in the coming months.XRP Price Prediction as Ripple Expands in Africa – Will Custody Services Boost XRP Above $0.52?
XRP’s chart is looking promising today, with the coin looking ready to post some more gains today after dipping a little overnight.What’s interesting is that the coin is about to test its resistance level (red), which stands at around $0.525.Source: TradingViewIf it can decisively break through this ceiling, then it may extend its gains into the weekend.Other indicators suggests that this is quite possible, with XRP’s relative strength index (purple) rising towards 70 once again after sinking to 50 in the very early hours of the morning.Similarly, the alt’s 30-day moving average (orange) is also rising again, having crossed over the 200-day average (blue) late on Wednesday evening.The coin’s 24-hour trading volume has also risen in recent days, with its move close to $1 billion suggesting an elevated interest in the token.There are various reasons to be bullish about the XRP price, with the first being the general direction of the wider market, which after a lull in mid-spring looks ready to grow again.Yet there are also fundamentals factors at play, with Ripple announcing this week its plans to launch custody services in the MENA region and deepen its presence in the region overall.Such news comes in addition to the imminent end of the long-running Ripple-SEC case, which is now in the final settlement phase.It’s possible that Ripple will face a settlement fine as high as $2 billion, yet the upshot of such a penalty is that it will draw a line in the sand and enable the firm to continue growing.And in the long run, this points to a rising XRP price, which could reach $1 by the close of 2024.High-Potential Meme Tokens Could Bring Bigger Gains
The only real issue with XRP is that, because it’s a coin that rests more on fundamentals than hype, it may take a while to enjoy some properly big returns.However, traders looking for quicker and bigger gains may do well to investigate some of the newer meme tokens that are currently doing the rounds.One of the most promising is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain crypto that has raised more than $15 million in its presale.Source: DogeverseDogeverse’s sale is in its final phase and will be ending soon, with investors having rushed to buy its tokens on the back of some exciting fundamentals and tokenomics.As the first ever multi-chain Doge-themed meme token, Dogeverse will run on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.What this means is that DOGEVERSE will attract more use and demand than it would have as a single-chain coin, which in turn could see its price rise higher than it might otherwise.What’s particularly bullish about its tokenomics is that it has a hard cap of 120 million, so in theory it could become deflationary over time.Added to this is its staking mechanism, which could see a big proportion of its total supply exit circulation.VIDEOSuch features help account for why its presale has already done so well, with latecomers able to get involved by going to the official Dogeverse website.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Fantom Blockchain Soars with Sonic Upgrade and TVL Surge | Coinspeaker



The recent strong performance being demonstrated by FTM token is an indicator that Fantom’s strategic initiatives may be beginning to bear fruit.

The Fantom blockchain’s native token FTM has emerged as one of the top-performing non-meme cryptocurrencies over the past week. However, the surge in its value may not be unconnected to the introduction of Fantom’s latest upgrade, dubbed Sonic.
Over the past seven days, FTM saw its value appreciate by over 9.20% to hit 80.3 cents. In comparison with most other tokens, FTM clearly had one of the best weeks in retrospect, signaling that there may be more than meets the eye about FTM’s recent success.




FTM Token Sees Remarkable Gains amid Network Enhancements
The Fantom Foundation has been actively promoting its Sonic upgrade. As of publication, 25 out of 60 nodes have already completed the transition. However, the full upgrade will only be realized after at least 40 nodes adopt the new software.
The Sonic upgrade is aimed at enhancing the network’s capabilities. A major selling point of the upgrade is that it is set to boost transaction speeds to an impressive 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) with a 1.1-second finality. This marks a major improvement over the current rate of just over 2.5 TPS that on-chain data suggests.
Interestingly, technological advancements brought by Sonic are not the only factors contributing to the performance of FTM. The network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has also shown remarkable growth. As data from DeFiLlama shows, Fantom’s TVL surged by nearly 83% in just two days. That is, it went from $111 million on May 14 to $203 million on May 16.
It might be worth noting that the TVL jump is an indication that there is a broader trend of increasing TVLs across various decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, yield aggregators, and other decentralized applications (dApps) that operate within the Fantom network. Many of these dApps that support the Fantom blockchain saw between 10% to 20% rises in their TVLs.  That is, within the last week.
Overall, the recent strong performance being displayed by FTM token does not exactly come as a surprise. It is merely an indicator that Fantom’s strategic initiatives may be beginning to bear fruit. With the successful implementation of the Sonic upgrade, Fantom is poised to deliver even greater value and utility to its users.

Crypto Influencers Exposed: Following Their Advice Could Cost You Big - Research


								Retail investors flocking to the digital currency market are finding themselves bombarded with advice from social media crypto influencers. These self-proclaimed gurus promise insights and recommendations, but a new study suggests their pronouncements may be more flash than substance.
Crypto Influencers: The Impact Of Tweets
The research, conducted by a team at leading universities, analyzed the impact of tweets from over 180 crypto influencers on follower behavior and token prices.
The results paint a concerning picture. While tweets were found to trigger short-term price increases, averaging nearly 2% within the first two days, these gains quickly evaporated. In fact, the study found a cumulative return drop of nearly 7% within a month of influencer endorsements.

The researchers observed a distinct pattern. According to Dr. Kenneth Merkley, co-author of the study, influencer tweets could create a temporary price surge, but this was often followed by a significant decline, suggesting the buying frenzy wasn’t based on long-term fundamentals.
The findings resonate with real-world examples. A recent report, for example, shows the ill-fated CryptoZoo project, spearheaded by YouTuber Logan Paul, which attracted millions in investments before facing accusations of being a “rug pull” – a scheme where developers abandon a project after taking investor money.
Crypto Influencer Recommendations Often Lead To Losses: Study
Recommendations from crypto influencers often result in losses, according to scientists from three universities. Chinese journalist Colin Wu reported that, on average, positions opened based on signals from crypto influencers on X (formerly Twitter) showed a decline of 2.20% after 10 days and 6.50% after 30 days.
This data comes from researchers at Indiana University, Harvard Business School, and Texas A&M University, who analyzed 36,000 tweets from prominent crypto influencers. The study covered recommendations for 1,600 different assets.


Celebrity Hype And The SEC Steps In
The rise of influencer marketing in the crypto space hasn’t gone unnoticed by regulators. The report highlights the European Commission’s recent complaint regarding potentially misleading crypto promotions on social media.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $66.359. Chart: TradingView
Investors Beware
Additionally, the new European Markets Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations could hold influencers accountable for market manipulation through their endorsements.
In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already cracked down on celebrities promoting unregistered cryptocurrencies. The research mentions high-profile cases like Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather Jr. facing legal action for failing to disclose payments for promoting the EthereumMax token, which subsequently crashed in value.

The study underscores the crucial role of responsible investing in the volatile crypto market. Social media influencers can be entertaining, but they shouldn’t be the primary source of investment advice.

What happens if Biden vetoes Senate bid to cancel SEC's crypto rule? - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Yesterday, the US Senate voted in favor of H.J.Res. 109, a bill aiming to repeal Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121) issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development is seen as potentially beneficial for the crypto industry’s future growth. However, the bill now faces a veto threat from President Biden.What happens if President Biden vetoes the bill?The good thing is that the bill could still become law without the President’s signature.Should Biden choose not to sign H.J.Res. 109, it will be returned to Congress along with his reasons for disapproval. Congress then has the option to override the veto with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and the Senate.If they succeed, the bill becomes law despite the President’s disapproval.On the other hand, if Congress fails to secure a two-thirds majority, the veto will stand, and the bill will not become law.If President Biden wants to veto the bill, he might also want to consider whether it’s worth it, and it all comes down to the US presidential election.Voter polarization on crypto regulation could potentially influence political polarization, but as of now, crypto does not significantly impact voting behavior. According to a Pew Research report in April last year, the issue doesn’t resonate deeply with most voters, with only 17% of American adults having used crypto.In short, crypto appears to be unpopular now, but it’s noteworthy that voters often base their decisions heavily on economic conditions, which, however, are not favorable for Biden.According to The Economist, persistent inflation and economic challenges under Biden’s administration could sway public opinion against him. How Biden has managed foreign policy issues could also impact his re-election prospects. Any perceived failures or unpopular decisions in these areas could lead to a loss of support.With key topics possibly not working in his favor, Biden may want to steer clear of seeking support from the US crypto community and now is the opportunity as his major rival, Donald Trump, has already taken action.Trump has recently expressed support for the crypto industry, promising to end hostility toward it if elected. While skeptics might view Trump’s shift as a strategic move to garner support, his previous engagement with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) lends some credibility to his promises.

U.S Senate votes to repeal SEC's crypto custody policy - SAB 121 - but... - AMBCrypto



United States’ Senate voted to scrap the SEC’s SAB 121 crypto custody policy 
Crypto backers supported the move, but whether the U.S president will veto it remains to be seen

In a surprise bipartisan move on Thursday, the U.S Senate voted to repeal SEC’s controversial SAB 121 policy. The SAB 121, an acronym for Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, is a policy by the SEC that critics viewed as a deterrence to investment banks from large-scale crypto custody services. 
Interestingly, Democrats joined their Republican counterparts and successfully voted for the resolution to repeal the policy with 60-38 votes. 
Here, it is worth noting that the White House had previously warned against such a move, claiming that it could constrain the SEC’s ability to protect crypto investors. The statement also said that President Joe Biden would use his veto if the need arose. 
Community reactions to SAB 121 resolution
The president’s veto threat will be the next test as the resolution will now head to his desk. Commenting on Biden’s threat, the Blockchain Association, quipped, 
“The threat of a presidential veto denies the fact that there is a growing awareness among the voting public, particularly young people, that crypto is something our elected officials should care about.”
The Association also highlighted how dire such a move could be, adding that about 48% of American voters don’t trust candidates that interfere with cryptos. 
United States’ SEC published the controversial SAB 121 guidance two years ago (March 2020). It instructed entities safeguarding crypto assets on behalf of others to include the assets in their balance sheets. 
This was contrary to traditional stocks held by the same custody entities, meaning that crypto assets would be treated differently. Apart from the need for high capital reserves to cushion against a risky balance sheet, the uncertainty from SAB 121 tipped Nasdaq and BNY Mellon to back out of crypto custody. 
Industry players have long voiced potential risks associated with Coinbase’s dominance in the crypto-custody sector. Notably, Coinbase is the custodian for 8 out of the 11 US spot BTC ETF issuers. Hence, some believe repealing SAB 121 could help mitigate the risks associated with a single-point of failure. 
Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley had this to say when the repeal went through, 
“U.S lawmakers want to foster sensible development of crypto in the U.S. Not some lawmakers. The majority. 2024 is the beginning of the mainstream era.”

In this episode, Evan Zinaman, founder and principal at Trailbreak, delves into the first-of-its-kind case of the Bueno brothers, who face Department of Justice charges for exploiting Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) in a cryptocurrency scheme. Accused of manipulating transaction ordering to create an arbitrage opportunity, the brothers are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud as well as wire fraud itself.
Zinaman explores the broader implications of MEV exploitation, addresses critics who say that the MEV exploiters just got a taste of their own medicine, and the need for block building participants to consider their legal and compliance responsibilities.
Show highlights:

What the charges against the Bueno brothers are about
How block building works on Ethereum and how the relay was manipulated by the Bueno brothers
The different types of MEV and which ones are acceptable
Why these charges could be seen as a “vanilla fraud,” according to Evan
Whether the benefits of MEV outweigh the cons of it
The lack of terms of service in the MEV space
How the regulators’ attention to the space has changed over time

Vitalik Buterin impressed by OpenAI's GPT 4


                                Vitalik Reveals: GPT-4 Passes Turing Test                                Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has always been a supporter of new technologies, whether it's creating a big Blockchain network like Ethereum or updating it with new features over time. Not only that, Buterin doesn't shy away from praising his own firm along with others that are innovating in the technology sector. In line with this, Ethereum's founder shared information about OpenAI's GPT-4, stating that it has successfully passed the Turing Test. The Turing Test is a benchmark for AI systems, determining how human-like a conversational model is.Referring to recent preprint research from the University of California, San Diego, Buterin wrote that finally, a production model has passed the Turing Test. Along with this, Ethereum's founder praised OpenAI's GPT-4, saying, This is incredible, this system is capable of fooling more than half of the people. This technology talks like humans and is capable of fooling anyone.Research on GPT-4 at the University of CaliforniaA recent study published by the University of California San Diego revealed that people are unable to distinguish between GPT-4 and humans in a Turing test. The research involved 500 human test subjects who participated in a blind test, where they interacted with both human and AI models. The aim was to determine whether the subjects could accurately identify which interactions involved humans and which involved the AI model.According to the research findings, in 56% of cases, humans mistakenly identified GPT-4 as a human. This suggests that in the majority of instances, the AI model successfully convinced humans that it was one of them. This highlights the gradual advancement of AI technology towards emulating human intelligence.The research indicates that AI, such as GPT-4, is becoming increasingly proficient at mimicking human behavior. It demonstrates that AI is progressing towards being able to engage in human-like communication and reasoning, potentially surpassing human capabilities in certain tasks over time.Growing Interest and Investment in Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence (AI) is gaining traction as people see its potential for the future. This has led many big tech companies, like Google and Microsoft, as well as individuals like Elon Musk, to get involved in AI. Vitalik Buterin, known for co-founding Ethereum, recently praised OpenAI's GPT-4 chatbot. It's possible he's considering working with OpenAI or starting his own AI projects, but nothing official has been announced yet. Currently, various companies are exploring AI opportunities and developing their own chatbot models. Elon Musk, for instance, has introduced his AI chatbot Grok to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT.Also Read:- SEBI Explores Regulatory Options for Cryptocurrency

Shiba Inu Skyrockets 1,590% in Key Metric as Whales Dive in to Save SHIB Price

Dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a 1,590% surge in large holder inflows, thanks to significant activity from whales, which are individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of SHIB.According to IntoTheBlock data, Large Holders Inflow, which tracks the funds going into addresses belonging to whales or large holders, is up 1,590%, owing to a significant surge in the last 24 hours. Notably, large holder inflows increased from 728.17 billion SHIB on May 15 to 3.97 trillion SHIB on May 16. Spike in Large Holders Inflows often suggests two things. The first is that considerable buying activity may be taking place. Many whale addresses typically buy on centralized exchanges and subsequently shift their purchases into cold storage.Second, spikes in large holder inflows can indicate price bottoms because whale addresses prefer to buy in bulk after significant corrections. Both scenarios might be likely as Shiba Inu's price battles key resistance.At the time of writing, SHIB was down 2.5% in the last 24 hours to $0.00002472. The last three days have been a battle for the SHIB price, with bulls persistently attempting to surpass the daily SMA 50 at $0.00002524.Shiba Inu bulls' attempts to break through this crucial resistance on May 15 were unsuccessful, with the SHIB price closing lower. Bulls are still making another try, with SHIB's price reaching intraday highs of $0.00002509.While bulls are in a bid to push the SHIB price higher, they are also making frantic moves to save the 56.65 trillion SHIB level where the cryptocurrency currently trades.According to IntoTheBlock data, 56.65 trillion SHIB are being held by 54,280 addresses in the range of $0.000023 to $0.000026 at an average price of $0.000025.That said, eyes are peeled on Shiba Inu's next price direction in the context of the 56.55 trillion SHIB range and a break above the tough MA 50 barrier. Whether the 1,590% surge in whale inflows will impact the SHIB price remains to be seen.

Michaël van de Poppe on His Crypto Investment Strategy | Cryptoglobe


                                
Michaël van de Poppe is a well-known cryptocurrency analyst and trader. He is based at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and is widely recognized for his insights into the crypto markets. Van de Poppe frequently shares his analyses and predictions on various social media platforms, particularly X. His expertise covers a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and various altcoins. Van de Poppe is also noted for his work in educating the crypto community through articles, videos, and market updates.



On May 16, Van de Poppe revealed through a detailed explanation on social media that he had sold all his Bitcoin holdings. Van de Poppe clarified that his decision was not due to a loss of faith in Bitcoin or a belief that Bitcoin had peaked for this cycle. Instead, he strategically aimed to reallocate his assets for potentially greater returns later in the year.



Van de Poppe highlighted the influx of major institutional investors into the Bitcoin market, with pension funds, insurance companies, and large hedge funds purchasing Bitcoin through the newly approved Spot Bitcoin ETF. Additionally, he mentioned, the CME Group’s announcement of a futures ETF and the prospect of option-based trading further established Bitcoin as a mature asset.



Despite the increasing institutional involvement, Van de Poppe noted that the simplicity of Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is diminishing. He explained that the impact of the Bitcoin halving on market dynamics is likely to decrease over time as institutions focus more on managing risk in their portfolios, influenced by macroeconomic factors and liquidity conditions.



Van de Poppe detailed his strategy, emphasizing the different methods to maximize returns in a Bitcoin bull cycle. He outlined four main approaches: selling Bitcoin at highs to buy back at lower prices, using leverage for trading futures, accumulating Bitcoin through earnings, and trading altcoins to increase Bitcoin holdings. Van de Poppe chose the latter, acknowledging its high risk but also its potential for significant returns.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

He justified his decision to move from Bitcoin to altcoins by highlighting the current market conditions and potential for altcoins to yield higher returns. Van de Poppe pointed out that the rotation from Bitcoin to altcoins typically occurs around the halving cycle. However, this cycle has shown continued strength in Bitcoin, prompting him to anticipate an eventual rotation that could benefit altcoins significantly.



Van de Poppe also discussed the potential impact of a spot Ethereum ETF approval despite the current regulatory challenges. He believes that the market may be underestimating the likelihood and timing of such an approval, which could lead to a significant market turnaround if the outcome is better than expected.



In his analysis, the popular analyst mentioned several key developments that could influence the crypto market, including the FIT21 bill, which aims to provide a regulatory framework for crypto in the U.S., and the XRP lawsuit, which could set a precedent for other altcoins. He believes that the regulatory clarity and potential positive outcomes from these events could catalyze a substantial recovery in altcoin prices.



While Van de Poppe acknowledged the risks associated with his strategy, including a potential loss of 50-80%, he expressed confidence in the possibility of achieving returns ranging from 300-900% in Bitcoin value within the next 6-12 months. He also anticipated further gains if Bitcoin stabilizes, projecting an overall potential return of 900-4500% over the next 12-24 months in this super cycle.



Ultimately, Van de Poppe’s decision to sell his Bitcoin and invest in altcoins is driven by his belief in the transformative potential of the Web 3.0 ecosystem and the ongoing tokenization of assets. He remains optimistic about the future of cryptocurrencies and is prepared to take calculated risks for potentially substantial rewards.

World's largest clearinghouse DTCC is experimenting with blockchain technology - Crypto Valley Journal

The "Smart NAV" pilot project by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), in collaboration with Oracle's Chainlink project and leading U.S. banks, tested the representation of market data on the blockchain.DTCC operates the largest securities settlement system in the world. To support the tokenization of traditional assets, the clearing house launched the Smart NAV pilot. Using Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), DTCC was able to provide net asset values (NAVs) of tokenized funds on multiple blockchains through a standardized process. Participants in the pilot include US financial giants BNY Mellon, Franklin Templeton, JP Morgan, State Street, Invesco and others.
Key Infrastructure for TokenizationThe term tokenization refers to the representation of traditional assets also known as real-world assets (RWAs) on a blockchain network. For example, since March 2024, BlackRock is offering a money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain. Benefits include increased transparency for traditional financial products, broader accessibility and cross-border settlement.An accurate representation of the net asset value (NAV) is critical to such efforts. This ultimately underpins the market price for new subscriptions to a product. With Smart NAV, DTCC aims to distribute this data directly on the blockchain. Chainlink's CCIP enables the application to be used across different networks, allowing the data to be queried and processed more efficiently.Diagram of the Smart NAV Project/ Source: DTCCPotential expansion of the experimentAccording to DTCC, the pilot demonstrated how many different use cases could benefit from having key market data represented directly on the blockchain. Specifically, the clearing house mentioned tokenized funds, smart contracts for large banks, and brokerage portfolio applications. Other benefits include automated real-time data distribution and integrated access to historical data.Based on the blockchain experiment, DTCC sees an opportunity to expand the scope of applications. This would involve exploring how the technical capabilities used in the pilot could support a broader range of use cases and across a larger number of blockchains. Smart NAV could be expanded in the following areas:Using a similar distribution model with expanded data sets (e.g., key reference data)Automating workflows across blockchains triggered by the distributed dataset (e.g., portfolio rebalancing triggered by NAV)Extend the smart contract governance capabilities used in Smart NAV to enable data collection directly from participants (as opposed to a centralized submission point).

Former Goldman Sachs Executive Raoul Pal Answers Key Question: 'When Do I Sell My Crypto?' - Benzinga

In his latest video podcast, Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal discusses when traders should sell their crypto. He suggests not nailing market tops and adopting a time-based approach.What Happened: While addressing the query "When do I sell my crypto?", Pal stresses the importance of understanding one’s goals and investment time horizon, noting that crypto is inherently cyclical. Pal states, "Crypto is very cyclical based on this ‘everything code’ thesis." This thesis ties these cycles to global financial patterns, Bitcoin halvings and U.S. presidential elections.Drawing on his own experiences, Pal shares his journey from buying Bitcoin at $200 in 2013 to navigating the extreme highs and lows over the years. "Every time I've seen anybody try to time the market, including myself, it's been suboptimal," he admits. "I would have made five times as much money by not doing anything," he reflects, highlighting the challenge of market timing.Pal advises against trying to precisely nail the market tops, suggesting instead a time-based approach. "Use time, not price," he recommends, proposing that investors take profits towards the end of the year when crypto typically performs well.Also Read: Why This Crypto Market Is ‘A Bear Trap’ And Which Coins This Trader Is BackingWhy It Matters: Pal underscores the importance of having cash ready to buy during market downturns. "Every time you buy those lows, you're going to 10, 20, 50x depending on what you're buying," he emphasizes, stressing the value of long-term compounding.He notes, "This time around, I didn’t do anything except buy when I thought we were close to the bottom." This strategy, he explains, allowed him to capitalize on significant market rebounds.Lastly, the Macro Guru touches on the emotional aspect of investing, recognizing the difficulty in reinvesting post-downturn due to fear of losses. "The hard thing is actually putting the same amount back in again," he says, acknowledging the psychological hurdles investors face. He underscores the importance of sticking with the secular trend and not being swayed by short-term volatility.Pal has previously predicted cryptocurrency markets to enter a “Banana zone,” with the total market cap rising to $10 trillion until the end of the decade. He has also predicted that Bitcoin BTC/USD will go as high as $1 million.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Bitcoin’s Rally Splits Trader Opinions: ‘Daily Says We’re Going Higher’ But One Indicator Presents A ‘Sell Signal On The 4H Chart’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Hong Kong pilots first-ever digital yuan payment system for cross-border transactions

The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) have taken significant steps to expand the Digital Yuan (e-CNY)’s reach beyond mainland China.On May 17, the HKMA announced a pilot scheme enabling the use of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) for cross-boundary payments.According to the authorities, this e-CNY scheme will provide safer, more convenient, and innovative cross-border retail payments between Hong Kong and Mainland residents.Cross-border transactionsThis initiative also allows Hong Kong residents to set up personal e-CNY wallets with their mobile numbers, but they cannot perform peer-to-peer transactions among themselves.Under this scheme, Hong Kong residents can fund their digital yuan wallets through 17 retail banks via the Faster Payment System (FPS). The statement added:“The interoperability between the FPS and the e-CNY system operated by the Digital Currency Institute (DCI) of the PBoC also marks the first linkage of a faster payment system with a central bank digital currency system in the world.”Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA, stated that the e-CNY application and wallet would gradually gain more functionality as more retail merchants adopt the system. He said:“By expanding the e-CNY pilot in Hong Kong and leveraging the 24×7 operating hours and real-time transfer advantages of the FPS, users may now top up their e-CNY wallets anytime, anywhere without having to open a Mainland bank account, thereby facilitating merchant payments in the Mainland by Hong Kong residents.”Moreover, HKMA said it plans to upgrade the e-CNY wallets to higher tiers through real-name verification and will support corporate use cases for cross-border trade settlements in the future.This initiative continues China’s efforts to popularize its CBDC program. The country already uses the currency to pay some of its workers monthly salaries.Latest Alpha Market Report

Pump.fun Favorites Michi and Mini Recover After Exploit-But These Tokens Are Still Stuck - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsA purported former Pump.fun employee drained an estimated $2 million worth of Solana from the protocol yesterday. This resulted in wallet provider Phantom blocking the site, a number of tokens getting stuck in bonding curve contracts, and trading being paused.Less than 24 hours later, it appears Pump.fun’s largest tokens have quickly recovered while the tokens affected by the attack are still stuck in limbo.Pump.fun is a protocol that allows users to create a Solana meme coin in minutes for only 0.02 SOL ($3). This has resulted in the daily record for new Solana-based tokens minted being broken with a slew of meme coins being created.Fortunately for meme enthusiasts, the Pump.fun team addressed the issue within seven hours of the attack. “Solana shit coins are back, and greater than ever,” the team posted on Twitter.Not long after the protocol was hacked, its highest market cap tokens dipped. Michi, Pump.fun’s largest token, fell 6% while SelfieDogCoin, the third largest token on the platform, plummeted 23%, and Mini, the next largest, dropped 22%—all in a matter of hours.Now the protocol says it has resolved the exploit and trading has resumed, these tokens have recovered. Michi has climbed 28% since its mid-hack low, SelfieDogCoin has jumped 20%, and Mini has skyrocketed 55%. While in the short-term the hack negatively affected Pump.fun’s biggest tokens, it appears that now the protocol has recovered it’s just brought more attention to tokens on the platform.However, these tokens had already become tradable on the Solana decentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium. This is done by reaching a market cap above $69,000 and completes a bonding curve (which adjusts an asset's price relative to its supply). Once it reaches this milestone, the liquidity is moved to Solana trading platform Raydium—meaning that investors can begin trading it outside of Pump.fun.Some on-chain sleuths deduced that with the aid of a private key—one only an employee of Pump.fun would have access to—the Pump.fun attacker appeared to target accounts completing this process, diverting funds earmarked for Raydium into unrelated wallet addresses. This resulted in tokens that hit 100% during the time of the attack being stuck in limbo. Unfortunately, this has still not been resolved.Tokens like Sim Wit Dicc, an NSFW token about the Sims game, Pre Wif, another dog coin, and Rnld Sweginatur, an Arnold Schwarzenegger meme, are all currently stuck. But the tokens are so small, there isn’t much of a community behind them to be outraged about it. That said, there are victims and Pump.fun intends to make these users whole.“The Pump.fun team will seed the LPs for each affected coin with an equal or greater amount of SOL liquidity that the coin had at 15:21 UTC within the next 24 hours,” the official account wrote on Twitter. “Please bear with us as we aim to resume the trading of these coins in a safe and structured manner.In the wake of the exploit, there has been a peculiar outpouring of love for the attacker. That’s because some people have been vocal in saying that Pump.fun is bad for Solana and the wider crypto community. In typical degen fashion, tokens dedicated to the attacker have started to appear. And ironically, the two of the largest hacker tribute tokens that Decrypt found went to zero almost immediately.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Chinese Police Bust $1.9 Billion Underground Banking Racket Involving Tether



                    

Chinese police have uncovered a $1.9 billion underground banking racket involving the popular stablecoin Tether in Chengdu. 



The operation utilized Tether to exchange foreign currencies and led to the arrest of 193 suspects across 26 provinces, according to a police report.




The report highlighted that these underground USDT operations began in January 2021. 



They were primarily used to smuggle medicine, cosmetics, and investment assets overseas. 



The authorities dismantled two such operations in Fujian and Hunan, freezing 149 million yuan (approximately $20 million) linked to these activities.




Despite China’s comprehensive prohibition on crypto-related activities, traders in the country continue to circumvent the ban, using crypto assets in alternative ways. 



A report by Kyros Ventures indicates that Chinese traders are among the largest stablecoin holders globally. 



According to the report, 33.3% of Chinese investors hold multiple stablecoins, placing them second only to Vietnam’s 58.6%.



The Chinese government has banned cryptocurrency use, cryptocurrency exchanges, and Bitcoin mining operations. 




However, the local population has consistently found ways to evade these restrictions over the years.

At the time of the Bitcoin mining ban, China was the largest contributor to the Bitcoin network hash rate. 



Remarkably, within a year of the ban, China’s mining hash rate contribution rose to second place despite the prohibition. 



Similarly, after the country banned centralized exchanges, Chinese traders shifted to decentralized exchanges.



In response to the ban, the use of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols by Chinese traders significantly increased. 



Some traders also used virtual private networks (VPNs) to defy the restrictions and continue their crypto activities.



The persistence of Chinese traders in using cryptocurrencies and stablecoins like Tether highlights the challenges faced by authorities in enforcing the ban. 



Despite stringent measures, the adaptability and ingenuity of the local population have allowed them to continue participating in the global crypto market.

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) to Skyrocket 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GAMBCAT has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gambling Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gambling Cat could become the next viral memecoin.



Gambling Cat launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gambling Cat on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gambling Cat by entering its contract address – B4BQTfBJ6uQYkzaZyQjTmH7k3c9gzXQ3FrPMPDstpYAn – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAMBCAT.

Here's How Much Justin Bieber Has Lost On His ApeCoin Investment - Benzinga

Known for his music, Justin Bieber has become one of the wealthiest people in the world. He has used this wealth in a variety of ways, ranging from philanthropic efforts to venture capital investments. However, a less-discussed way in which the singer has used his fortune is with cryptocurrency. Bieber began investing in cryptocurrency and NFTs in 2021, and the investments have lost quite a bit of value since they were acquired. Let's take a look:Bieber first began purchasing NFTs in 2021, towards the tail end of the NFT hype wave that stormed the crypto community. In early 2022, Bieber purchased Bored Ape #3001 for 500 ETH, or around $1.3 million at the time. Don't Miss:Additionally, around the same time, Bieber bought Mutant Ape #922. For this NFT, he paid 28.8 ETH, or just over $70,000. These NFTs allowed Bieber to access the ApeCoin airdrop. ApeCoin is a governance token that powers the ApeCoin DAO. However, most investors simply see it as a proxy for investing in the Bored Ape NFT projects without having to shell out tens of thousands. The airdrop occurred in March 2022, and gave out 15% of the total supply to holders of Bored Apes. Specifically, owners of a Bored Ape got 10,000 tokens and owners of a Mutant Ape got 2,000 tokens.At the time, the airdrop was extremely profitable and delivered huge amounts of value to holders of the NFTs. One month after the airdrop, the price of the token hit a high of $27.60. This means that Bored Ape holders would have received $276,000 from the airdrop, and Mutant Ape holders would have received $55,200.Trending: How much Bitcoin did Michael Saylor says you need to become a millionaire? The number may shock you.Bieber held both of the NFTs, so at one point, his position was worth over $331,000. While this is a long way from the nearly $1.4 million he shelled out to purchase the NFTs, it is a huge amount to essentially receive for free, as Bieber did not directly pay for any of the ApeCoins. However, Bieber likely regrets not selling the position when it was worth over $331,000. Since hitting those highs, the price of ApeCoin has continually fallen, likely from Bored Ape holders selling their tokens to realize their profits. ApeCoin has been trading between $1 and $2 for nearly a year, and Bieber's position is worth just $14,000.This marks an unrealized loss of nearly 96%, since the position was worth as much as $331,000, and is currently worth $14,000.Bieber has also seen huge losses on the NFTs themselves, which have resulted in a loss of nearly 97%. Read Next:

Solana Developer Admits to Stealing $300,000 in User Funds, Cites Gambling Addiction as Cause



                    

Hoak, a developer for the Solana-based Cypher Protocol, has publicly admitted to stealing nearly $300,000 in user funds and subsequently gambling them away. 



His confession was made through a post on X on May 14, where he stated, “To address the elephant in the room, the allegations are true, I took the funds and gambled them away. 




“I didn’t run away with it, nor did anyone else.”



This admission followed a previous revelation by another core contributor, Cobra, who highlighted the missing funds in a post a day earlier.



Cobra detailed the theft in his post, explaining how Hoak systematically withdrew funds over several months from the cypher redemption contract, converting them into different cryptocurrencies and transferring them to Binance. 




The transactions involved multiple steps and intermediary wallets, and totaled $317,000 in Solana, Tether (USDT), and USD Coin. On-chain data traced these movements back to Hoak’s associated addresses.



At the time of the thefts, Hoak’s wallet contained significant amounts of digital assets, which were mostly transferred to Binance within a few days in April. 



These actions have further damaged the reputation of the Cypher Protocol, which had already suffered a major hack in August 2023, resulting in the loss of over $1 million in digital assets.

Hoak, addressing the motivations behind his actions, attributed the thefts to a severe gambling addiction and other psychological issues. 



He expressed, “I am also in no way, shape, or form attempting to victimize myself, but this is the culmination of what snowballed into a crippling gambling addiction and probably multiple other psychological factors that went by unchecked for too long.”



The case of Hoak raises concerns about the prevalence of gambling behavior within the cryptocurrency industry, often criticized for its casino-like environment. 



Gary Gensler, Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, has likened the crypto ecosystem to “casinos in the Wild West,” calling stablecoins the “poker chips” of the space. 



Moreover, a 2023 YouGov survey found a significant correlation between harmful gambling and cryptocurrency ownership, suggesting that those who gamble at risky levels are also more likely to engage in crypto trading, potentially exacerbating their financial vulnerability.

Changpeng Zhao Yet to Serve Prison Time Despite 4-Month Sentence | Coinspeaker



If due process is not followed by the Probation or Pretrial Services Office, Zhao’s legal team can contend for a reduction in the sentencing duration on due process grounds. 

Crypto exchange Binance’s co-founder and former chief executive Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ in the crypto industry, has yet to see the inside of a prison cell despite his four-month sentencing announced on April 30. As per a report from Protos, a combination of factors, including the formalities in the justice system, the Fifth Amendment, and the efforts of world-class lawyers, resulted in Zhao not being inside the walls of the prison.
United States District Judge Richard A. Jones sentenced CZ at Seatac, an administrative security federal detention center and prison in Western Washington with a total of 931 inmates. The judgment signed by Judge Jones stated that Zhao “shall surrender for service of sentence as notified by the Probation or Pretrial Services Office.”




CZ pleaded guilty in 2023 to money laundering violations, and Binance paid a hefty $4.3 billion fine to settle with the Department of Justice (DoJ).
Interestingly, as of now, these offices have not yet notified the ex-Binance head and crypto billionaire of the date he must report to the California prison.
Reasons for Changpeng Zhao Not Being in Prison Now
As per US laws, a criminal’s sentence begins once they are either received in custody awaiting transportation to, or voluntarily surrender to, the official detention facility. However, a delay can occur in three cases:

The judge may order the defendant to surrender to the US Marshals, who will be responsible for notifying the criminal of his prison date.
The judge may authorize the Probation or Pretrial Services Office to notify the defendant of their prison entry date.
The judge might allow the defendant to voluntarily report to prison—a case applicable to criminals with short sentences or who possess low flight risk.

Zhao was granted the second option. As he was not sentenced to a multi-year term, US Marshals did not immediately take him into custody. Instead, he awaits notification from the Probation or Pretrial Services Office.
Additionally, the Probation or Pretrial Services Office has to complete an analysis of the criminal before notifying them of the prison date. The analysis includes checking the resources of the facility, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the offender’s history and characteristics, among other things.
As a result, Zhao is still not inside prison walls because the Probation or Pretrial Services Office hasn’t completed its analysis. The Fifth Amendment guarantees due process for every criminal who may or may not reside in the United States.
Moreover, Protos also reported that Zhao’s defense team, comprising seven lawyers and additional support staff from three prestigious law firms, Latham & Watkins, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, and Davis Wright Tremaine, played a significant role in delaying the commencement of his prison term.
If due process is not followed by the Probation or Pretrial Services Office, Zhao’s legal team can contend for a reduction in the sentencing duration on due process grounds.

The attempt by Dogecoin (DOGE) bulls to push the price of the coin beyond the $0.153 mark suffered an intense rejection overnight. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is currently trading for $0.1526, down by 1.17% in 24 hours. The price slump derailed its efforts as it ambitiously jumped from a low of $0.1491 to its current level.DOGE Price Chart via TradingViewDogecoin is always pushing for a breakout. While it has no definitive internal catalyst that can drive its growth, it has managed to propel its growth from general market sentiment. This was, however, not enough to push interest in the past few hours. The meme coin’s trading volume suffered a massive slump, down by 38% to $1,160,682,932.This level of retail volume is not commensurate with the general interest in the Dogecoin community. As reported earlier by U.Today, Dogecoin proponents are strongly anticipating the addition of DOGE to X Payments. The expectation is that when it is live, there will be more demand for Dogecoin, hence driving more value to DOGE in the long term.The price action of Dogecoin, as depicted in the DOGE 4H Chart, pegs the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 53, a little above average. From here, a little pressure mounted by DOGE whales to revert the bearish outlook in daily volume can serve as a major catalyst to boost prices.With vocal voices within the Dogecoin ecosystem exerting their influence in the market as a whole, it remains to be seen where the next catalyst for growth will spring up from.In the year-to-date (YTD) period, Dogecoin has outperformed the general market, up by 68% overall. Should it sustain this pace, it might end Q2 on a positive note, irrespective of the current bearish trend. In all, the coin’s immediate price target is set at $0.16 to match its four-week high.

SEC Suffers Embarrassing Blow To Anti-Crypto Bill, Ripple CLO Celebrates The Victory | Bitcoinist.com


								The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has experienced another embarrassing setback, as an anti-crypto bill proposed by the regulator has been completely shut down by the United States Senate. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, has openly celebrated this outcome, marking it a noteworthy victory for the cryptocurrency industry. 
SEC’s Anti Crypto Bill Falters
 On March 31, 2022, the US SEC proposed a Staff Accounting Bulletin No.121 (SAB121), requiring financial institutions responsible for the crypto assets of clients to record or register these digital assets as liabilities on their balance sheets. This bill, viewed as a threat to the decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency industry and US regulatory custodial services, was labeled by Alderoty as an “unauthorized overreach” by the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler. 

In an almost unanimous decision with Bipartisan support, the Senate and the House of Representatives voted vehemently against the controversial SAB-121 proposal. 
Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer of crypto exchange, Coinbase, disclosed in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that the Senate voted for repeal, achieving a supermajority with approximately 60 yes votes and an added rebuke for the SEC’s “overreach and disdain for the federal administrative law.”  
Furthermore, Alderoty commemorated the Senate’s rebuff of the SEC’s anti-crypto bill, emphasizing that Gensler’s attempt to control the cryptocurrency industry was getting out of hand. He also stated that the regulator’s ongoing efforts to govern an industry beyond its purview would not be tolerated anymore, highlighting that technological innovation should not be a partisan issue.
MicroStrategy’s Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Michael Saylor also commented on the SEC’s revoked bill in an X post, celebrating the Senate’s bipartisan decision.
“Wall Street wants Bitcoin, the House of Representatives wants Bitcoin, and now the Senate wants Bitcoin,” Saylor stated. 
Currently, the failure of the SEC’s proposed bill represents a significant blow to the regulator’s aggressive stance on cryptocurrency regulation. This comes on the heels of the agency’s legal battle with Ripple and a series of enforcement actions and lawsuits against cryptocurrency companies such as UniSwap, Coinbase, Binance, MetaMask and more. 
Moreover, the nullified bill highlights the growing influence of the crypto industry in both technological and political circles, securing recognition among lawmakers and traditional banking institutions in the US. 
Pro-Ripple Lawyer Calls SEC Actions “Regulatory Insanity”
In another X post, John E. Deaton, a pro-XRP lawyer and supporter, has described the SEC’s aggressive enforcement actions on the crypto industry as “regulatory insanity.” He disclosed that the US SEC was being used as a weapon by Senator Elizabeth Warren, a crypto antagonist to support her political agendas. 

As the spokesperson for the SEC’s SAB-121 bill, Warren had expressed support for the anti-crypto proposal, arguing that by approving the rule, investors would have better protection against risks associated with cryptocurrency volatility. 
Deaton has disclosed that the SEC’s attempt to “protect investors” was laughable given that the regulator has caused more financial distress to the investors it claims to protect. He has also stated that Warren was placing her agendas above investor protection.

Bitcoin To $100,000: Infamous Head And Shoulders Pattern Appears To Signal The Start Of Another Rally


																Crypto analyst Crypto Jebb recently highlighted an inverse heads and shoulders pattern that had formed on the Bitcoin chart. This bullish pattern indicates another rally may be on the horizon for the flagship crypto, which could send its price to $100,000. 
How Could Bitcoin Could Rise To $100,000
Crypto Jebb revealed in a video on his YouTube channel that the inverse heads-and-shoulders pattern he had been predicting for a while had finally formed on the charts. He predicts this pattern could lead to a price breakout, sending Bitcoin’s price to $70,000. The analyst also noted that the price target of the bullish pattern is at $75,000, which indicates that Bitcoin could hit a new all-time high (ATH) on its next leg up. 

	Related Reading



Crypto Jebb mentioned that there is a “great degree of likelihood” that Bitcoin would experience a major rally, which would send it to $100,000 should it break its current ATH of $73,800. The crypto analyst believes that Bitcoin’s rise to that price level is very likely, considering that it has seen a “pretty large corrective movement” since hitting a new ATH over two months ago. 
The crypto analyst warned that there is a scenario where Bitcoin could also end up trading sideways between $60,000 and $64,000, which would signal a period of consolidation. He noted that Bitcoin could even drop lower during this period. However, Bitcoin’s outlook is generally bullish based on the technical indicators that crypto Jebb highlighted. 
The analyst highlighted the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), which he noted is turning “very bullish” on the daily chart and shows that the bulls are regaining control. He also claimed that Bitcoin is witnessing a ‘green red green’ formation on the daily chart, indicating that the crypto token is “doing very well.”
BTC Is In “Very Bullish Territory
Crypto Jebb mentioned that Bitcoin is currently in very bullish territory, especially since Altcoins are also rallying. He claims this indicates a “great degree of confidence” in the market at the moment. The crypto analyst also noted that the stock market just broke an all-time high, which he stated is big news for Bitcoin.

	Related Reading



He explained that this is big news for Bitcoin because the flagship crypto follows the stock market and moves significantly whenever the stock market experiences a breakout. As such, with the stock market breaking its ATH, he expects Bitcoin to do so soon enough. 
Crypto Jebb further explained that the rationale behind Bitcoin following the stock market is that investors are more confident in investing in risk-on assets when they see that the risk-off (the stock market) is doing so well. 
Crypto Jebb predicts that Bitcoin will become a risk-off asset in the next ten to twenty years. When that happens, he predicts that hundreds of billions of dollars in investment will be made in the flagship crypto.

Solana 'beats' Bitcoin on this front, but is bad news around the corner? - AMBCrypto



Solana’s network activity remained high in May 
SOL’s price action was bullish, but sentiment around it turned bearish 

Solana [SOL] has been in the limelight lately owing to its achievements in the NFT ecosystem. However, that’s not all, with recent datasets revealing that the blockchain has excelled in yet another domain after it flipped Bitcoin [BTC]. 
Solana’s high network activity 
SolanaFloor, a popular X handle, recently tweeted that the blockchain managed to overtake Bitcoin in terms of revenue generated in the last 24 hours. To be precise, SOL generated $1.65 million in revenue, while BTC generated ‘just’ $1.5 million. 
The reason behind this performance could be Solana’s robust network activity. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Artemis’ data revealed that SOL’s network activity remained high in May. Not only did its daily active addresses climb sharply, but SOL’s daily transactions also spiked on 10 May. Here, it’s worth noting that the same fell soon after. 
Source: Artemis
The hike in network activity helped the blockchain generate more revenue. We found that SOL’s fees have risen sharply since the beginning of May, allowing its revenue to also grow. 
Everything in the DeFi space also looked pretty optimistic as its TVL hiked. Additionally, SOL dominated BTC heavily in terms of network activity. 
Both SOL’s daily transactions and addresses remained considerably higher than those of BTC. In fact, SOL’s fees remained higher than BTC’s, as the latter’s number witnessed a major drop on 7 May. 
Source: Artemis
Apart from this, SOL has been performing well in the NFT ecosystem as well. AMBCrypto had reported previously that there has been a slight hike in Solana NFT volumes over the last seven days, primarily driven by top collections. 
SOL remains bullish 
In the meantime, Solana bulls stood strong in the market as its weekly chart remained green. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL has appreciated by over 5% in the last seven days. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $163.26 with a market capitalization of over $73.27 billion. 
Thanks to the price uptick, Solana’s social volume hiked over the last few days. However, it was surprising to see a drop in SOL’s weighted sentiment.

AMBCrypto then checked SOL’s daily chart to see whether this uptrend would continue. As per our analysis, SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick and seemed to be heading further away from neutral 50 – Sign of a sustained uptrend. 
However, the token’s price had touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands – A sign of prospective selling pressure.

Oklahoma passes bill protecting ‘fundamental bitcoin rights’ - Blockworks


Oklahoma passed a bill earlier this week that protects state residents’ right to self-custody digital assets. 
The bill will go into effect on November 1, 2024. 
OKHB3594 was signed into law by Governor Kevin Stitt. It was sponsored by four Republicans — State Senators Bill Coleman and Dana Prieto and State Representatives Brian Hill and Cody Maynard.
Under the bill, Oklahoma bans restricting or outlawing the use “or the self-custody of digital assets using a self-hosted wallet or a hardware wallet,” a page for the bill said. 
Oklahomans can also mine crypto both at home and industrially, though they have to comply with local noise ordinances.

“Anyone engaged in home digital asset mining, or digital asset mining business, staking, or staking as a service shall not be required to obtain a money transmitter license,” the bill said.
Additionally, “discriminatory electricity rates for digital asset mining businesses are outlawed as well.”
Residents can use crypto to pay for goods and services and are protected from paying additional taxes.
“Digital assets used as a method of payment may not be subject to any additional tax, withholding, assessment or charge by the state or local government that is based solely on the use of the digital asset as the method of payment,” the bill continued.
Satoshi Act Fund CEO Dennis Porter called the bill “groundbreaking” and said it was designed to protect “fundamental bitcoin rights.”

“The idea that ‘We the People’ cannot hold our own assets is antithetical to American values. Without the ability to manage our wealth, we lose control of our destiny and the chance to create better futures for our families. This law ensures that everyone can secure not only their [bitcoin] but all their assets,” he wrote in a post on X.

GameStop Tanks 26% After Company Files to Sell 45 Million Shares - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsVideo game store turned meme stock GameStop has filed to sell up to 45 million of its GME shares. This move will see the total number of shares increase by as much as 15%. This comes the same day that GameStop filed its preliminary Q1 results which revealed that net sales have decreased 30% compared to last year. That said, the company’s net loss is expected to be up to $23.5 million less than last year, although this could still leave GameStop with a net loss of up to $37 million.If GameStop is able to sell 45 million shares at the current market price of $227, the company could bring in up to $990 million—although shifting such a high volume of shares is likely to move the price of the stock. Pre-market trading saw shares drop by as much as 20% overnight. And things didn’t improve after the opening bell. At the time of writing, GME is trading for about $21 and stretching the losses to 24% compared to Thursday’s closing price.The company acknowledged recent price fluctuations, but stopped short of name-dropping Roaring Kitty, the r/WallStreetBets Reddit community, or its status as a “meme stock.”"Our common stock has experienced extreme volatility in price and trading volume.” GameStop said in the prospectus supplement. “We did not experience any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume.”GameStop has become somewhat of a cult meme stock after the 2021 short squeeze which saw the stock reach its all time high of $81. Meme influencer Roaring Kitty played a central role in this saga which was later turned into a documentary and feature film. Earlier this week, Roaring Kitty appeared to return to Twitter after three years of silence which has seen more volatility for the stock—prompting exchanges to halt trading at least six times.The prospectus listed a number of factors which have influenced the price of GME, as a nod to its past this list includes “short squeezes,” as well as “message boards and social and other media.”Several firms opened short positions against GameStop in the run up to the 2021 short squeeze. That included Melvin Capital, which lost nearly $3 billion after it was forced to close its positions.GameStop highlights short sellers are continuing to trade its stock which it says puts “pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing volatility in its market price.” Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Market expert sets DOGE price to ‘$0.49 and beyond’ soon


Despite many assets in the cryptocurrency industry starting to move in a more positive direction, Dogecoin (DOGE) seems to still be waiting for an upwards trigger, but one crypto expert believes that traders of the popular doge meme token might not wait for much longer.
As it happens, popular pseudonymous crypto market analyst CoinsKid has shared his view that Dogecoin could “run to $0.49 and beyond” in the near future, as “invalidation is losing the bottom of the potential C wave in May at $0.11929,” as he explained in an X post on May 17.

DOGE price prediction
Indeed, the current DOGE chart pattern emerged just a couple of days after the crypto trading expert observed the “textbook inverse head & shoulders on the daily for DOGE,” the structure also known as a reverse head and shoulders, which hints at an upward price trend, or a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal.

Meanwhile, another pseudonymous crypto analyst, World Of Charts, is less bullish, albeit nonetheless predicting that Dogecoin could increase its price very soon, setting the target to between $0.27 and $0.30, days after expert known as Behdark suggested a “long-term bullish rally.”

DOGE price analysis
For now, Dogecoin is changing hands at $0.15266, suggesting a decline of 0.58% in the last 24 hours, an advance of 2.37% across the previous seven days, and an accumulated gain of 0.27% on the monthly chart, according to the most recent price data retrieved on May 17.

All things considered, the beloved doge meme token, favored by Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, could, indeed, surge toward the highly optimistic price target at $0.49, especially after recently considering the fact that it has recently broken out from a resistance trend line.
However, things in the crypto market can sometimes change rapidly, so doing one’s own research and carefully weighing all the risks instead of blindly relying on other people’s recommendations and opinions is essential when investing in any of its assets.

Ethereum's Potential Upside Surprises: Coinbase Report


Coinbase projects that Ethereum (ETH) might outshine other cryptocurrencies shortly.
The company’s recent report suggests that the second-largest cryptocurrency has the potential to surprise its holders positively.
Key Factors Supporting Ethereum’s Potential

This year, Ethereum has lagged behind the broader crypto market. Despite this underperformance, Coinbase remains optimistic about its long-term prospects. The report highlights ETH’s 29% year-to-date rise, positioning it well due to a lack of significant supply-side pressures like token unlocks or miner sell-offs.
Coinbase analyst David Han highlights that ETH benefits from substantial and growing liquidity sinks. Staking, where investors lock up tokens to support the network and earn rewards, has been a major factor. Additionally, Layer 2 solutions, which scale the Ethereum by processing transactions off the main blockchain, have grown considerably.

The expert also notes the increasing institutional interest. As more financial institutions explore blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethereum, the backbone of most DeFi applications, benefits significantly. The platform’s versatility and infrastructure make it a preferred choice for developers and investors alike.
The Impact of Potential Spot ETFs Launch
The potential launch of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US could significantly impact the asset’s market position, boost liquidity and potentially driving up its price. Although the SEC recently hinted at a possible denial, the mere prospect has already stirred market excitement.  

Scott Johnsson from Davis Polk and Wardwell highlighted the SEC’s call for public input on classifying BlackRock’s proposed spot Ethereum ETF as a commodity-based trust. Johnsson suggested that denying the ETFs could be strategic, as they might be misfiled as commodity-based trust shares. 

“We think the market may be underestimating the timing and odds of a potential approval, which leaves room for surprises to the upside,” Han said.

No matter how the US ETF story ends, Coinbase’s report suggests that Ethereum will outperform in the coming months. Strong demand drivers and technological innovations help ETH remain a key asset to watch.

Chainlink surges 30% as DTCC explores blockchain for mutual fund data delivery

Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has released the findings of its Smart NAV pilot, which explored extending its Mutual Fund Profile Service to leverage distributed ledger technology for data dissemination and consumption. The news led to Chainlink (LINK) surging 30% over the past 48 hours, trading at $16.71 from a low of $12.8 on May 15, as the DTCC concluded that,“an opportunity for on-chain price and rate data that can serve as a key enabler to the exploration of new initiatives.”The Smart NAV pilot aimed to utilize DTCC’s digital asset capabilities and Chainlink’s technology for cross-chain interoperability and blockchain abstraction. This initiative was part of DTCC’s broader efforts to support the financial industry’s exploration of digital assets in financial services.DTCC is a post-trade financial services company providing clearing, settlement, and information services for various securities, including equities, corporate and municipal bonds, government and mortgage-backed securities, money market instruments, and over-the-counter derivativesThe pilot targeted the increased industry interest in mutual fund tokenization and the need for on-chain price and rate data. By adopting a chain-agnostic approach, DTCC sought to enable the distribution of Net Asset Value (NAV) data across multiple blockchains, facilitating new use cases.The Smart NAV pilot involved extending DTCC’s Mutual Fund Profile Service I (MFPS I), the industry standard for transmitting NAV data. Ten market participants and Chainlink collaborated, focusing on the feasibility and value of delivering a DLT-based solution for price and rate dissemination. This initiative aimed to embed foundational data into various on-chain use cases, such as tokenized funds and bulk consumer smart contracts, supporting future industry exploration.The pilot demonstrated that structured data delivery on-chain and established roles and processes can enhance numerous downstream use cases. These include brokerage portfolio applications and other business workflows, benefiting from real-time, automated data dissemination and historical data access.Smart NAV’s core capability revolves around making trusted, verifiable data available on any blockchain network to support its use in business processes. DTCC acted as the data provider and governor of the on-chain solution, while Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) enabled interoperability. The pilot’s success suggests the potential for broader applications beyond the dissemination of price and rate data across more blockchains.Chainlink Market DataAt the time of press 2:09 pm UTC on May. 17, 2024, Chainlink is ranked #15 by market cap and the price is up 20.34% over the past 24 hours.

Coinbase Research Report Predicts Upside Surprise in Ethereum (ETH) | Coinspeaker



Coinbase said that the market is underestimating the odds and timings of a potential spot Ethereum ETF approval, thereby leaving sufficient space for upside surprises. 

The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has delivered a lackluster performance in comparison to Bitcoin and other altcoins in the market. However, the latest report from Coinbase shows that Ethereum’s long-term positioning remains strong and it could surprise investors on the upside very soon.
The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value has increased by 29% year-to-date, trailing behind its larger counterpart, Bitcoin (BTC), which has surged by 50%. But the Coinbase report mentions that “Ether may have the potential to surprise to the upside in the coming months”.




It also added that as of now, the altcoin doesn’t have any major sources of supply-side overhang such as pressure created by miner selling or token unlocks. Coinbase analyst David Han wrote:
“To the contrary, both staking and layer 2 growth have proven to be meaningful and growing sinks of ETH Liquidity. ETH’s position as the center of decentralized finance (DeFi) is also unlikely to be displaced in our view due to the widespread adoption of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its layer 2 innovations.”
The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is the core processing system of the Ethereum blockchain. It enables developers to create smart contracts and allows nodes to interact with them. Layer 2s are independent blockchains built on top of layer 1s (the base layer), designed to alleviate scaling and data bottlenecks.
Don’t Discard Spot Ethereum ETFs
Furthermore, Coinbase notes that the potential for spot Ethereum ETFs can’t be understated. The crypto exchange believes that the market is underestimating the odds and timings of a potential approval, thereby leaving sufficient space for upside surprises.
The first deadline for the approval of the spot Ethereum ETF stands next week on May 23. However, several market analysts have stated that the chances of such an approval seem to be very slim at this point. Some of the top market analysts also believe that the US spot Ethereum ETFs won’t come until the end of 2025.
“Even if the first deadline of May 23, 2024, encounters a rejection, we think there is a high likelihood that litigation could reverse that decision. In the interim, we believe the structural demand drivers for ETH as well as the technological innovations within its ecosystem will enable it to continue straddling across multiple narratives,” the Coinbase report reads.

Crypto Investors Turn Greedy as Bitcoin Surges Past $66K


																The crypto market is rife with greed again following bitcoin’s (BTC) latest rally to a three-week high of over $66,000.
Data from Alternative.me shows the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is currently as high as 74, indicating a period of greed among digital asset investors.
Crypto Investors Are Greedy
The surge in crypto market sentiment to greed follows a period of neutrality among market participants. CryptoPotato reported earlier this month that the fear and greed index stood at 54 for the first time since January, representing neutral sentiment among investors, while BTC traded around in a range between $57,000 and $60,000.
At the time, BTC and the broader crypto market experienced heightened volatility and a massive wipeout in total market capitalization. On one occasion, BTC fell below its crucial support levels, crashing 11% within 36 hours.
The plunge drained the crypto market of more than $200 billion, leaving a trail of ruins among altcoins and meme coins. Notably, digital asset investment funds were affected, with some networks seeing consecutive weeks of outflows.




However, the tide has changed this week, with the bulls taking over the reins on Monday. After hovering around $61,000 during the weekend, BTC surged to $63,000 on Monday and then persisted to $64,000 on Wednesday. At the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency was changing hands at $66,200, up 5% in the past seven days.
Bitcoin’s upward trajectory has extended to the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, with inflows surging to a multi-week high. On Wednesday, flows into the ETFs hit $303 million, a figure last seen on May 3. Yesterday, the funds also saw inflows totaling $257 million. The two consecutive days of substantial inflows contrast the flows seen in the last two weeks, which are mostly less than $100 million.
What Happens Next?
For the uninitiated, the Fear and Greed Index determines investor sentiment by analyzing several factors, including market momentum, volatility, bitcoin’s dominance, trends, and social media. On a scale of 0 to 100, 0 indicates extreme fear, 50 signals neutrality, and 100 means extreme greed.
With the index at a point of greed, a further market rally could push it to the extreme greed zone. Unfortunately, this would give room for a correction, which is typical in crypto markets.
Regardless, the surge in liquidity entering the market could push BTC out of its current price range to a higher level.

Ripple Co-founder Larsen Praised for Visionary Leadership


							

Schwartz credits Larsen’s visionary belief in Ripple’s potential



Larsen’s leadership launched real-world Ripple applications



Larsen’s vision and persuasion attracted top talent to Ripple




David Schwartz, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Ripple, recently acknowledged the critical role played by co-founder Chris Larsen in the company’s history. In a public statement, Schwartz lauded Larsen’s early belief in Ripple’s potential and his unwavering commitment during the company’s formative stages.







Larsen, who co-founded Ripple in 2012 alongside Jed McCaleb and Arthur Britto, is credited with recognizing the potential of blockchain technology for cross-border payments even before Schwartz himself. This foresight, coupled with his strategic vision, laid the groundwork for Ripple’s evolution into a prominent player within the fintech and blockchain industries.









Beyond conceptualizing Ripple’s potential, Larsen is recognized for his ability to translate those ideas into tangible business applications. His leadership in launching real-world use cases positioned Ripple as a leader in revolutionizing cross-border payments and financial infrastructure.



Schwartz also emphasized Larsen’s persuasive leadership style, which was instrumental in garnering support from key stakeholders. Larsen’s ability to effectively communicate Ripple’s vision is credited with attracting top talent and fostering a culture of innovation within the company. Brad Garlinghouse, who succeeded Larsen as CEO in 2016, has stated that Larsen’s influence played a significant role in his decision to join Ripple.







Larsen’s influence on Ripple serves as a testament to the power of visionary leadership and unwavering commitment in shaping the future of financial technology.

Ethereum (ETH) Report from Coinbase: "Ethereum May Be Preparing for a Significant Move!" Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to Coinbase's research report, Ethereum (ETH), although it has underperformed in the cryptocurrency market this year, may experience a significant rise in the coming months.
The report highlights several factors that could contribute to a positive outlook for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.


So far this year, Ethereum is up 29%, lagging behind Bitcoin's (BTC) impressive 50% rise.
However, Coinbase's analysis suggests that Ethereum's long-term position remains solid and could outperform in the near future.





“Ethereum may have the potential to surprise upwards in the coming months,” the report said, emphasizing that the cryptocurrency does not face significant supply-side pressures such as token unlocks or miner sales.
These factors, which often undermine price stability, are notably absent for Ethereum.


Coinbase analyst David Han noted that the growth of staking and layer 2 solutions has significantly absorbed ETH liquidity.

“ETH's position as the center of decentralized finance (DeFi) is also unlikely to be displaced in our view by widespread adoption of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and layer 2 innovations,” Han added.





The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is an integral part of the Ethereum blockchain and enables developers to create and interact with smart contracts.
Building on top of the base layer, Layer 2 solutions help alleviate scaling and data bottlenecks, improving the overall efficiency of the network.
Additionally, the potential approval of spot US Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could play a pivotal role in boosting Ethereum's market performance.

Coinbase suggests that the market may be underestimating the likelihood and timing of such approvals, providing further upside potential.

Synthetix's sUSD Stablecoin Loses Its Dollar Peg amid Heavy Sell-Off



The depeg situation of Synthetix’s sUSD has once again highlighted the vulnerabilities within DeFi systems and the impacts of liquidity shifts.

Synthetix’s decentralized stablecoin sUSD has seen an unexpected turn of events after it slipped below its intended $1 peg. The stablecoin, issued through the Synthetix DeFi protocol, fell to as low as $0.92 on Thursday before making a partial recovery to $0.96.
sUSD Depeg Caused by Liquidity Issues
The incident was initially identified by Chaos Labs, a risk manager for the Aave lending protocol. According to their analysis, the depeg was triggered when a major liquidity provider withdrew from the sBTC/wBTC liquidity pool on the Curve decentralized exchange. This provider redeemed sUSD via Synthetix’s spot synth redemption and subsequently sold it on Curve, causing a sudden drop in sUSD’s value.




Synthetix, a platform enabling the creation of synthetic assets or Synths, mints sUSD as a loan overcollateralized with various crypto assets to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. However, the recent activity has exposed weaknesses in this mechanism.
The implementation of SIP-2059 at the end of April was responsible for deprecating non-sUSD spot synths on the Ethereum mainnet. As that ended atomic exchanges for other synths like sETH and sBTC, users were forced to convert the synths into sUSD, increasing the selling pressure on the stablecoin.
Meanwhile, this is not the first time a stablecoin will be experiencing a depeg that stems from liquidity issues. Last October, real estate-backed stablecoin USDR fell to $0.53 per coin, albeit in a similar manner. At the time, the team explained that a redemption rush drained liquid assets such as DAI from its treasury. Company statement about the USDR depeg reads in part:
“Combined with the lack of DAI for redemptions, panic selling ensued, causing a depeg.”
Stablecoins Not ‘Stable’
For stablecoins to retain the meaning of their names, they are intended to always be worth $1 on the open market. However, under certain market conditions, they sometimes lose their peg.
Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), one of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, briefly fell to $0.885 per coin on March 11, 2023. That was around the period that several banks in the US went bankrupt. Although USDC regained its peg three days later, Terra’s UST was not so lucky. UST lost its peg in May 2022 and never recovered. It is valued at $0.02219 per coin as of publication.
The depeg situation of Synthetix’s sUSD has once again highlighted the vulnerabilities within DeFi systems and the impacts of liquidity shifts. However, in the meantime, Chaos Labs has recommended that the Aave community should temporarily freeze sUSD reserves on Aave V3 on the Optimism network. This freeze, they claim, would help to mitigate further market impact.

2 cryptocurrencies to avoid trading next week


Positive sentiment grows in the cryptocurrency market after weeks of bearish and neutral dominating sentiments. However, some cryptocurrencies are trending mostly due to negative sentiments, and investors should avoid trading them next week.
It is worth noting that the crowd’s sentiment is volatile and does not necessarily reflect the intrinsic fundamentals of the trending projects. Still, social indicators and public perception can potentially impact a cryptocurrency’s short-term price action.
Avoiding trading particular cryptocurrencies trending for the wrong reasons can help investors keep a solid risk management strategy.


In this context, Finbold retrieved data from Santiment’s trending cryptocurrencies on May 17, looking for insights. Notcoin (NOT) and Toncoin (TON) lead today’s top 10 trends, with a dominating negative sentiment.

Avoid trading Notcoin (NOT) and Toncoin (TON)
Notably, Santiment‘s social index signals a bearish momentum for Notcoin as users report withdrawal issues to Binance and TON wallet. The platform’s AI summary reports as follows:

“The crypto project Notcoin seems to be facing some negative sentiment in the social media platforms. Users are expressing frustration over not receiving their Notcoin, experiencing significant drops in their balances, and encountering issues with exchanges.”
– Santiment’s Bearish summary on “notcoin”

Conversely, NOT has had bullish mentions of successful cashout, trading opportunities, and crypto exchange listings.
Trending Coins, indicators May 17, 2024. Source: Santiment / Finbold
Notcoin was born as a reward token for a Telegram game designed to onboard users on The Open Network (TON). The first negative experience has also affected the market’s overall perception of Toncoin,  the blockchain’s native token.

“The main reasons to be bearish on the TON project include concerns about the functionality and reliability of the TON wallet, with users reporting issues with deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.”
– Santiment’s Bearish summary on “ton”

TON price analysis
On the other hand, Toncoin had a remarkable performance in 2024, up 184% year-to-date, currently at $6.67. The Open Network has successfully attracted investors and developers for its ecosystem, presenting solid long-term fundamentals.
Moreover, technical indicators suggest the token could hold its current prices or surge further despite the dominating sentiment. TON trades above its 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA), and the relative strength index (RSI) suggests a strong momentum.

Therefore, the “avoid trading” warning is also valid for short-sellers trying to profit from TON’s current issues, as the digital asset could still perform despite recent events.

From BTC to HPC: Miners signal evolving focus after the halving - Blockworks


Bitcoin miners have spoken after the halving. 
Many have said they are looking to wade deeper into the high-performance computing (HPC) space in a world of lower BTC rewards.  
HPC proved an oft-heard acronym out of the mouths of industry executives in recent weeks as the segment’s companies reported first-quarter results — and more importantly, detailed future growth strategies. 
Sure, miners continue looking to improve efficiency and reduce costs via upgrading hardware and mining algorithms, noted BlocksBridge Consulting founder Nishant Sharma. 
But the per-block rewards drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC on April 19 has kept companies focused on building out their ex-mining revenue streams.
“A trend that started before [the] halving and appears to be gaining traction among bitcoin miners is repurposing bitcoin mining infrastructure for HPC and other [AI] applications,” Sharma told Blockworks.
This is not exactly a new trend. Hive Digital Technologies was among the first to get serious about this pivot by tweaking its company name in July 2023. It noted at the time that its 38,000 Nvidia GPUs — or graphics processing units — have the capability to do AI workload.
It remains early days, as Hive realized $900,000 of HPC-related revenue in the fourth quarter.  The company has not reported revenue marks for the first three months of 2024. 
But others have. 

Bit Digital, Iris Energy and Hut 8 are among the miners that have started reporting the revenue earned from the HPC business line.
“I believe more companies will start doing so after their AI/HPC ventures become operational,” Sharma said. 
Bitcoin mining giant Hut 8 reported $3.3 million in revenue under its “high-performance computing, colocation and cloud” umbrella — roughly 6% of the revenue it generated during the quarter. 
CEO Asher Genoot called the company’s HPC business “sub-scale” in March, noting its infrastructure would need more investment to handle AI machines.

But the company earlier this quarter launched a new AI vertical under a “GPU-as-a-service model,” he noted on Hut 8’s Wednesday earnings call. It purchased 1,000 Nvidia GPUs and secured a deal with an unnamed AI cloud platform. 
Genoot said he expects revenue generated from the new vertical to start in the year’s second half, with a forecasted annual rate of roughly $20 million.
“Today, we believe bitcoin mining generates the highest return on investment into large scale stranded load interconnection assets,” the Hut 8 CEO added on the call. “However, we also see a massive opportunity in the broader energy infrastructure sector as demand grows across new use cases like AI.”
Read more: The Bitcoin halving is over — greener mining is coming
A bit further along on the HPC revenue journey was Bit Digital, which saw about $8 million in revenue — 27% of its total first-quarter revenue — come from HPC.
That business started generating revenue in January. Bit Digital disclosed the new unit — focused on supporting generative AI workstreams — in October, noting it had bought 132 integrated HPC platforms and 1,056 GPUs for $35 million. 
Meanwhile, Iris Energy is also still building out its AI cloud services business. 
The Australia-based miner generated $600,000 in revenue from that segment during the first quarter after commissioning 248 Nvidia GPUs to customer Poolside AI. 
It bought 568 additional Nvidia H100 GPUs for $22 million in February. Those were expected to be delivered this quarter.   
Other HPC-centric aspirations
Though others — such as Core Scientific, Stronghold Digital Mining and Terawulf — don’t yet have a dedicated HPC revenue line listed, that doesn’t mean they aren’t committed. Or at least mulling what it could do for their business. 
Core Scientific’s “significant advantage” over industry peers is its exclusive control over its in-demand high-power data center infrastructure, CEO Adam Sullivan said during an earnings call last week.
That HPC segment is “the next major growth opportunity for our business,” he added.
Core Scientific said in March that it would lease up to 16 megawatts (MW) of capacity in its Austin data center to cloud provider CoreWeave, with possible revenue from the deal exceeding $100 million. More than 500 MW of the miner’s total 1.2 gigawatts of contracted power can be utilized for alternative compute workloads, executives noted.
Read more: Rival miners Marathon, Core Scientific each think they have an edge over peers
Stronghold Digital Mining opened up the possibility of selling its assets, or the company outright, on its May 2 earnings call. 
CEO Greg Beard wanted listeners to know that its 130 MW of energized data center capacity could expand to more than 400 MW — with a possible focus on supporting AI and machine learning.
Meanwhile, Maryland-based mining company Terawulf is finalizing the design for the HPC section at its Lake Mariner Facility in New York. It has committed a 2 MW power block capable of deploying thousands of GPUs. 
Joe Flynn, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, estimated in a May 14 research note that Terawulf could generate up to $1.5 million of yearly revenue, per megawatt, from HPC co-location services. 
He added: “We continue to prefer miners that own and operate their own infrastructure, and believe there is optionality for [Terawulf] to pursue AI/HPC opportunities that would lead to a re-rating of the stock from long-term and more predictable free cash flows.”

SOL Founder Reflects on Solana's Original Vision: Details

In a recent tweet, Solana labs cofounder Anatoly Yakovenko revisited the original vision behind the Solana blockchain, revealing a perspective that diverges from the common throughput-centric narrative. According to the Solana founder, who goes by the name "toly" on X, Solana was not primarily designed for maximum throughput; instead, its core purpose is to synchronize state across the globe as swiftly as the laws of physics permit. Solana is an integrated, open-source blockchain that aims to synchronize global information at the speed of light. It prioritizes latency and throughput, sacrificing some verifiability. It intends to accomplish this with features such as its novel timestamp mechanism called proof of history (PoH), block propagation protocol Turbine and parallel transaction processing.The SOL founder's comments come in the wake of the most recent CoinGecko report, which found Solana to be the fastest among large blockchains, with its actual daily average transactions per second (TPS) hitting a record high of 1,504 on April 6 this year amid the meme coin mania.Solana was found to be 46 times faster than Ethereum and more than five times faster than Polygon, which has the highest TPS among Ethereum scaling solutions.While Solana has been lauded for its high throughput capabilities, the SOL founder emphasizes that this was not the primary objective. The focus was not merely creating a "faster" blockchain but building a system that could achieve global state synchronization with unparalleled efficiency.According to CoinGecko, despite being the fastest blockchain, Solana has only reached 1.6% of its theoretical maximum speed of 65,000 TPS. At the same time, the increased volume of transactions caused network congestion, and it remains to be seen how quickly Solana can achieve greater real TPS with its planned enhancements. SOL, the native coin of the Solana blockchain, is the fifth largest cryptocurrency, valued at $74.74 billion and trading at $166.54 at the moment.

Spot Ethereum ETF Odds Are 'Underestimated', Says Coinbase


								Coinbase Research has issued a detailed report, written by David Han, emphasizing that the likelihood and timing of a US spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval are significantly underestimated by the market. The potential approval of such an ETF is poised to bring profound changes to Ethereum’s market dynamics.
The Case For A Spot ETH ETF Approval
The report delves into the critical importance of a spot ETH ETF, drawing parallels with the successful approval of spot BTC ETFs in the US. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has provided regulatory clarity and attracted significant capital inflows, reinforcing Bitcoin’s status as a macro asset. Similarly, a spot ETF would open Ethereum to the same capital pools that currently favor Bitcoin, fundamentally altering investment patterns within the crypto ecosystem.
Han underscores the core argument for a spot ETH ETF: the high correlation between CME ETH futures and spot prices. This correlation was a key factor in the approval of spot BTC ETFs.
“The correlation between the CME futures product and the spot exchange rates is sufficiently high such that CME’s surveillance can be reasonably expected to detect misconduct in the spot market,” Han states. This reasoning is expected to be equally applicable to Ethereum, given that the CME ETH futures launched just a month before the correlation study period used for BTC ETF approvals.

Despite the significant market potential, the report highlights the differences to Bitcoin and recognizes the regulatory uncertainties, particularly around Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. The complexities of staking—such as slashing conditions, validator differences, and unstaking liquidity risks—introduce additional layers of consideration for regulators. “The complexities of staking present unique challenges, but these should not impact the status of unstaked ETH,” Han notes.
Market sentiment, as reflected in trading platforms like Polymarket, currently prices the odds of a spot ETH ETF approval by May 31, 2024, at 16%. However, Coinbase’s analysis suggests these odds are significantly higher, closer to 30-40%. This divergence indicates that the market may not fully appreciate the potential regulatory and market shifts in favor of Ethereum.
Han also points out that even if the initial deadline of May 23, 2024, encounters a rejection, there remains a high likelihood that litigation could reverse such a decision. “Crypto is becoming an election issue, and the SEC may not be willing to expend the political capital necessary to support a denial,” Han argues, suggesting that political dynamics could also play a role in the regulatory process.
The approval of a spot ETH ETF would not only align Ethereum with Bitcoin in terms of regulatory clarity and access to institutional capital but also disrupt traditional capital flow patterns within the crypto market. Historically, capital has rotated from Bitcoin to Ethereum and then to higher-beta altcoins. A spot ETH ETF would potentially streamline this flow, directly channeling institutional investments into Ethereum.

This approval would also mitigate one of the largest overhangs for ETH, especially in a challenging regulatory environment. “The potential approval of a spot ETH ETF removes a significant barrier, opening up ETH to new capital inflows and regulatory clarity,” Han emphasizes.
Ethereum’s Long-Term Positioning
Beyond the immediate implications of a spot ETF, Coinbase’s report delves into Ethereum’s strong long-term positioning. Despite facing competition from other layer-1 networks like Solana, Ethereum’s advantages—such as the maturity of its developer ecosystem, the proliferation of its EVM platform, and its role as DeFi collateral—remain unparalleled, according to Han.
The growth of Ethereum layer-2 solutions and the reduced ETH burn post-EIP-1559 are highlighted as factors enhancing its value proposition. Additionally, Ethereum’s historical trading patterns reveal its dual role as both a store-of-value and a technology-token, adding to its unique market positioning.
In conclusion, Coinbase’s analysis presents a compelling case for the near-term approval of a spot ETH ETF in the US. The report suggests that market participants may be underestimating the odds and timing of such approval, leaving room for potential upside surprises.
“We think the market may be underestimating the timing and odds of a potential approval, which leaves room for surprises to the upside,” Han remarks. Moreover, he predicts that ETH may “have the potential to surprise to the upside in the coming months. ETH does not appear to have major sources of supply-side overhangs such as token unlocks or miner sell pressure.”
At press time, the ETH price stood at $3,028.

Analyst Utilizes Supply And Demand Principles To Determine Bitcoin Price


																For analysts and investors alike, comprehending the variables that influence price action in the complex world of cryptocurrency markets is essential. Ali Martinez, a well-known cryptocurrency expert, has recently provided insights into the fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin by applying the basic economic theory of supply and demand. 
Understanding Bitcoin Prices Through Supply And Demand
It is worth noting that any asset’s price movement, including cryptocurrencies, is determined by the fundamental rules of supply and demand. An asset’s price tends to decrease when supply outpaces demand, while prices typically increase when supply cannot keep up with demand.

Thus, Ali Martinez has deduced the crypto asset’s price and holders’ behaviour by applying the method and other on-chain metrics. Martinez’s analysis demonstrates how fluctuations in the market’s buying interest and the availability of Bitcoin are key factors influencing its price trajectory.
According to Martinez, Bitcoin’s Realized Cap witnessed a significant increase mid-way through March when BTC hit a new all-time high of $73,000. This indicated that the majority of BTC’s long-term holders were likely yielding gains at the time.
As a result, several investors sold their holdings, which led to a sharp rise in realized profits. Following realized profits in March, long-term holders felt safe adding over 70,000 BTC to their investments at these prices.
BTC Realized Cap spike in mid-March | Ali Martinez on X
Meanwhile, when the market’s growing supply of Bitcoin exceeded demand, the coin saw a substantial correction from the $73,000 level to the $57,000 level. 
Given that short-term holders are more likely to sell their holdings due to price volatility, this decline took Bitcoin below its realized price for short-term holders, inciting fear in the market. However, despite investors’ concerns, the short-term holder’s Realized Price at the $65,500 level acted as an accumulation point.
On the basis of this principle, Martinez believes the likelihood of Bitcoin continuing its upward trajectory will only increase when demand for the cryptocurrency starts to exceed the supply of BTC accessible in the market.
Using BTC On Exchanges To Support The Principles
Martinez has underscored that the available BTC on crypto exchanges can be used to confirm these supply and demand laws. He further noted that over 30,000 BTC have been moved to private wallets for long-term storage in May, indicating confidence among holders in the potential worth of Bitcoin.

Observing Bitcoin’s price using the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, Martinez cited a retracement above the +0.5σ pricing band at $64,600. Such an upswing has historically caused BTC to test the pricing range of 1.0σ, which is backed by increasing demand. Meanwhile, this price range at the moment is roughly lingering at $77,000.
Presently, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $66,275, indicating an over 5% increase in the past week. Although prices are up, its trading volume has declined by 24%, while its market cap is up by 0.23%.

The Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan detained without bail in Nigeria

Nigeria: a court has rejected the bail request of Tigran Gambaryan from Binance. As a result, Nigeria has taken Binance and its executives to court, accusing them of tax evasion and money laundering.
Let’s see all the details below. 

Nigeria: bail denied to Tigran Gambaryan of Binance
As anticipated, the bail request for the detained Binance executive, Tigran Gambaryan, has been rejected by a court in Nigeria. 
The spokesperson for the executive’s family stated that this happened because there is a risk that he may escape if released on bail. 
Last Friday, hearings were held for the bail of Binance’s Chief Compliance Officer, Tigran Gambaryan, accused of money laundering and tax evasion. 
The court has ruled that Binance can be served with the accusation of tax evasion through Gambaryan.
Gambaryan’s lawyers have challenged the request, arguing that they need a review of the amended charge in order to properly advise their client. The court has agreed to postpone the matter until May 22 for the official charge.
Gambaryan has been detained in Nigeria since February, when he arrived with a colleague. His detention occurred one month after the arrest of Binance executives in the country, all accused of money laundering and tax evasion.
He was later transferred to Kuje prison, where there are also members of the terrorist group Boko Haram.
The money laundering trial, conducted by the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), began on Friday, with the first prosecution witness called by the Nigerian SEC. 
Gambaryan’s lawyers requested a break to obtain certified documents to use in the cross-examination of the witness, and the court postponed the next hearing to May 23rd.
A spokesperson for Binance expressed deep disappointment over Gambaryan’s detention, emphasizing that he has no decision-making powers in the company and that the accusations are groundless. 
He requests his release during the discussions between Binance and Nigerian government officials. Binance CEO, Richard Teng, also appealed to the Nigerian government to release Gambaryan.
Binance CEO’s appeal for the release of Gambaryan
As mentioned, Binance CEO, Richard Teng, urged the Nigerian government to release Tigran Gambaryan, head of the Financial Crime Compliance team at the cryptocurrency exchange.
Teng highlighted the serious impact of this detention on the global business community, emphasizing the need to address this issue urgently.
The context of the economic crisis affecting Nigeria, with its currency in decline and inflation at the highest levels in decades, adds an additional layer of complexity to the situation. 
The confrontation between Binance and the Nigerian authorities regarding licensing requirements has been ongoing since 2022 without satisfactory responses from the competent institutions.
The arrest of Gambaryan and Binance’s regional director for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla, after an official meeting, has raised questions about the transparency and legality of the actions taken by the authorities. 
The fact that Anjarwalla managed to escape custody has raised further questions about the management of the whole affair.
Currently held on charges of money laundering in Kuje prison, Gambaryan has faced delays in legal proceedings, highlighting the complexity and challenges of the Nigerian legal system.
The appeal filed by Gambaryan and Anjarwalla against the Nigerian authorities for alleged violation of their human rights adds a further element of tension to an already complex and delicate situation.

'Dogecoin Isn't Dead,' Asserts Trader: GameStop And AMC Showed Retail Is 'Risk On' And DOGE 'Will Move Vertical Once Again' - Benzinga

Crypto Kaleo expressed his belief in Dogecoin‘s DOGE/USD resurgence, attributing it to the retail sector’s renewed risk appetite.What Happened: In a Friday post on X, Kaleo highlighted the shift in the retail sector’s risk tolerance across the meme coin board, as evidenced by the performance of GameStop and AMC.

Unshaken by Financial Setbacks, Maximillian White Blends Cannabis, Blockchain, and NFTs for Success



                    

Financial failure does not faze medical marijuana millionaire and entrepreneur Maximillian White.



Europe’s wealthiest legal cannabis tycoon has faced significant misfortune, both in his own career and his father’s. 




Notably, he lost $29 million in the Cypriot banking collapse of 2012. Instead of conserving his remaining funds, he purchased a Rolls Royce to drive around publicly.



“I’m a proud man. I didn’t want people to think I was lost,” he says. “I may also be a poser.” In reality, he is a hard worker unafraid of failure.



White now embraces blockchain technology and NFTs as part of his business. 




He compares it to a Manhattan cocktail, where the combination of ingredients makes it great. “For me, it’s the combination of cannabis, blockchain, and crypto – you can’t go wrong.”



White began his career in music production, including working with Drake on the hit “One Dance.” He built and sold the music streaming service Beatport, earning millions.



His ventures extended to Portugal, where he created Blanco Beach, a beach club frequented by celebrities like Rio Ferdinand and performers like Tyga and Rick Ross. Although it has since closed, it showcased his diverse interests.



White, who has ADHD, says it gives him eclectic tastes in music, from classical to hip hop. 




He knew he was destined to be a business builder since primary school, dressing up as an entrepreneur for a school event.

His work ethic is rooted in his early life as a chorister at Durham Cathedral, where he sang daily without breaks, even on Christmas.



White made his fortune selling medicinal marijuana worldwide and establishing Europe’s largest plantation in Portugal. 



He expanded into real estate in Dubai, Majorca, and Eastern Europe, driven by the loss of his family home during childhood. His brother’s tragic death in 2022 further marked his resilience.



Legal marijuana is gaining acceptance globally, with medical use legal in over 50 countries and recreational use in nine. Despite past plans for a cannabis cryptocurrency called MEDI falling through, White remains innovative.



Collaborating with digital marketer Ricardo Capone, White integrates NFTs with his cannabis products to ensure traceability via blockchain.



Initially skeptical about NFTs as art, White was excited by their potential for smart contracts. 



“Smart contracts made me delve further into the space,” he says, highlighting their business applications.



His latest project, Dr Green, uses NFTs as “unique business passes.” Holders access the Dr Green DApp to build a cannabis-selling community. 



The NFTs act like licenses, tradeable and increasing in value with customer base growth.



Despite his blockchain enthusiasm, White remains cautious about cryptocurrency valuation against the dollar, questioning its decentralization.



“Our NFTs are acting like a digital key or real-world asset, where you can plug into the systems of a company that is already up and running.”

                        As major cryptocurrencies look to end the week on a strong footing, with Bitcoin (BTC) looking to push above a key short-term resistance zone, traders are parsing through their options in the altcoin market that might be the best crypto to buy now.Bitcoin nudged up 1.5% on Friday and was last trading close to weekly highs just above $66,000.CPI data released earlier this week gave the cryptocurrency market a major boost as Fed rate cut hopes rose.Bitcoin is also experiencing headwinds due to spot Bitcoin ETF demand and the Bitcoin adoption narrative.US spot Bitcoin ETFs have enjoyed net inflows every day this week, totaling over $750 million so far.$550 million of these flows came in the past two days, as per Farside Investors.Meanwhile, 13F filings this week by US asset managers have shown that over 500 institutions acquired Bitcoin ETFs last quarter.These include a range of multi-national banks, like Morgan Stanley, and even a state pension fund.Bitcoin is lagging behind a surge in the US stock market, with the S&P 500 hitting fresh record highs above 5,300 this week.Bitcoin, by contrast, is 10% down from its March record highs near $74,000.But if Bitcoin can break above late-April highs at $67,000, a pushback above $70,000 is possible.Bitcoin could easily 2x as interest rates fall and institutional adoption continues, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewThe prospect of a near-term test of its all-time highs means that Bitcoin might be the best crypto to buy now for many investors.Indeed, over the next year or so, Bitcoin could easily 2x as interest rates fall and institutional adoption continues.The lower issuance rate to miners will also be a major long-term tailwind after the latest halving.That said, many crypto investors will be hunting for gains that are bigger than 2x.Smaller and lesser-known altcoins are riskier than Bitcoin but much more likely to yield 5-10x gains.Here are some strong-performing altcoins that might be the best crypto to buy now on Friday.Best Crypto to Buy NowArweave (AR)Decentralized data storage and hosting service network Arweave (AR) just hit its highest levels since January 2022.As per CoinMarketCap, Arweave gained 10% in the past 24 hours and was last in the $48s.The cryptocurrency has already rebounded 125% from its April lows.If it can continue its momentum and push back to its 2021 highs, further 2x gains are potentially in store.Currently, Arweave has a modest market cap of around $3.2 billion.As its promising protocol gains further adoption, this market cap could expand 5 or even 10x beyond its current level.That’s why Arweave potentially ranks as the best crypto to buy now.Hedera (HBAR)Another strong-performing altcoin on Friday is Hedera (HBAR). The cryptocurrency is up 6.5% in today and trades at an upper $ 0.11.HBAR powers the decentralized, open-source, proof-of-stake Hedera public ledger.It appears to have formed an ascending triangle, a break above which could open the door to a near-term pushback to April highs.The prospect of quick 50% gains means that HBAR is potentially the best crypto to buy today. Source: TradingViewHedera saw a big pump last month after news emerged that a BlackRock fund would be tokenized on its blockchain.The prospect of quick 50% gains means that HBAR is potentially the best crypto to buy today.THORChain (RUNE)Multi-chain DEX THORChains (RUNE) is up 5% in 24 hours on Friday as it attempts to break above key resistance.Last at $6.94, RUNE is eying a push above key resistance in the $7.20 area.Once this level is broken, RUNE could quickly pump back to its March highs above $11.The prospect of quick 65% gains makes RUNE possibly the best crypto to buy right now.Crypto Alternatives to Consider
While all of the above coins offer a potential 5-10x upside in this bull market, some traders are hunting for more.Meme coins are one way to generate big gains. But, owing to their lack of clear utility, they are very risky.A better way to make 50-100x gains might be to invest in web3 startups via presales.Upcoming projects often offer their tokens at a steep discount to early investors as they raise funds for development.Presales have their own risks – a project might fail to meet expectations, for example.That’s why it’s crucial that traders don’t rush their investments. Rather, they should take the time to assess and project properly and do their own research.Here are some of Cryptonews’ favorite presales for 2024 that could be a good starting point.21 Best Crypto Presales to Invest In Now

Bitcoin Mirroring Exact Scenario That Preceded Run to Record High, Says Kevin Svenson - Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl


								Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Kevin Svenson is saying that Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing bullish signals in a similar manner to what happened earlier this year.
Svenson tells his 78,100 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is breaking out of a reversal bottom pattern.










“We are breaking out of a reversal bottom pattern. So this is really bullish, I would say… Bitcoin is also above the Relative Strength Index (RSI) downtrend line on the daily chart. And this is just a signal for continuation to the upside…”
The RSI is an oscillator used to identify oversold or overbought conditions.
According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s price action is currently mirroring what was witnessed just before the flagship crypto asset surged to around $73,737 in mid-March.
“It’s no different than this zone in early 2024 when we had a sideways consolidation, downward sloping resistance on the RSI and we broke out leading us to new all-time highs.
Bitcoin is once again playing out the exact same scenario, likely leading us to new all-time highs.”
Svenson says that Bitcoin is in the fourth stage of a parabolic curve pattern which could theoretically peak at $90,000. In technical analysis, a parabolic curve pattern consists of four stages or bases where the price trades in a range at each of the stages, before continuing upwards.
“This is the textbook target of $90,000; this is not the cycle peak target. I think that in this bull cycle, considering that the halving just happened, we could go higher than $90,000. But we may have to cool down before that. 
So that could mean that Bitcoin runs up to our parabolic trend target of $90,000 before seeing a breakdown of that trend with a sideways consolidation. And then a further push up creating a larger more expansive parabolic trend.”

Crypto Influencer Touts CTF's Growth Potential on XRP Ledger


							

CTF poised for potential growth with a limited total supply of 100 million tokens.



CTF price volatile despite limited supply (down 0.23% in 24 hours)



CTF bridge aims to improve interoperability in DeFi space




JackTheRippler, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency community, recently drew attention to CryptoTradingFund (CTF), a token within the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. JackTheRippler expressed optimism about CTF’s potential for growth, citing its limited total supply of 100 million tokens as a factor that could influence its value.







A hypothetical scenario presented by JackTheRippler suggests that if the total market capitalization of CTF reached $10 billion, the token price could rise from its current level of $1.77 to $374.25. However, it is important to note that such projections are speculative and do not account for various market factors.



Current trading data for CTF paints a mixed picture. While the token has exhibited some resilience in a volatile market environment, with the current price a t$1.77,  it has experienced a slight decline of 0.23% in the past 24 hours. The 24-hour trading volume of $27,195.30 also suggests relatively low liquidity.



The recent price surge could be attributed to an unidentified market event or positive news related to CTF. The subsequent consolidation phase suggests that investors are evaluating this development. Trading activity appears to have fluctuated throughout these price movements.









The upward spike in price signals a noteworthy market event or positive news catalyst. This surge is followed by a consolidation phase, indicating market participants are digesting the recent developments. Throughout these fluctuations, varying levels of trading activity are observed.



Looking ahead, CryptoTradingFund’s upcoming bridging mechanism, scheduled for launch on June 5th, aims to improve interoperability between blockchain networks. This development has the potential to facilitate smoother asset transfers and unlock new possibilities within the DeFi space.

What Is GameStop and the GME Phenomenon? How the Meme Stock Craze Unfolded - Decrypt

In January 2021, video game retailer GameStop (GME) became the center of an unprecedented stock market phenomenon, as GME stock prices skyrocketed due to a massive short squeeze sparked by retail traders on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets forum.Here's what you need to know about GameStop and the GME saga.What is GameStop?GameStop is an American video game, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise retailer. Founded in 1984 as Babbage's in Dallas, Texas, GameStop grew to become a major player in the retail gaming market. It has thousands of physical stores around the world, where gamers can buy, sell, and trade video games and consoles.However, in recent years, GameStop faced significant challenges due to the digitalization of gaming and increasing competition from online retailers. Exacerbated by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, this led to declining sales and store closures, making GME a target for short sellers who bet against the company's stock.r/WallStreetBets and the GME phenomenonIn late 2020 and early 2021, GameStop became the focal point of a massive coordinated buying effort initiated by retail investors on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets—including Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty.These investors aimed to trigger a short squeeze—a situation where short sellers are forced to buy shares to cover their positions, driving the stock price up further.By January 2021, the movement had gained significant momentum. GameStop's stock price, which was around $17 at the beginning of the year, soared to an all-time high of $483 on January 28, 2021, fueled by a combination of retail investor enthusiasm, social media influence, and the financial strain on hedge funds that had heavily shorted the stock.The aftermathThe GME surge led to enormous gains for some retail investors, while also causing substantial losses for certain hedge funds. It prompted a wave of trading restrictions on platforms like Robinhood, sparking debates about market fairness and regulatory oversight.The meme stock mania became something of a pop culture moment, too, making household names out of traders like Roaring Kitty. There was even a 2023 feature film, “Dumb Money,” based on their exploits.The GME phenomenon had several lasting impacts. Many new participants were drawn into the stock market by the meme stock phenomenon—especially younger investors using mobile apps such as Robinhood. Regulators and lawmakers increased their scrutiny of meme stocks and short selling practices. And GameStop itself leveraged its newfound attention and influx of capital to shift its focus towards e-commerce and digital ventures such as NFTs—with mixed results.The future of GameStopFollowing the r/WallStreetBets short squeeze, GameStop embarked on a bid to expand into NFT collectibles via a marketplace for digital assets and an Ethereum wallet. The strategy foundered as the broader NFT market lost momentum, with CEO Matt Furlong saying in December 2021 that it would put less focus on NFT and crypto-related efforts, amid layoffs in the crypto team.Furlong was ousted as CEO in June 2023, with Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen assuming the role of executive chairman. Under Cohen’s leadership, the company has embarked on a strategic pivot. The goal is to turn GameStop into a technology-driven company, focusing on e-commerce and leveraging its existing customer base.In May 2024, interest in GameStop as a “meme stock” was briefly revived when r/WallStreetBets figurehead Roaring Kitty seemingly returned from a lengthy absence on social media.Although the financial influencer didn’t directly reference GameStop, his apparent return was enough to spark a rally in stocks and crypto assets affiliated with his past exploits—including GameStop.The second wave of meme stock mania was short-lived, however—though some lucky traders made bank trading GME options.Editor's noteThis article was written with the assistance of AI.

Nvidia to Report Earnings Next Week, What to Expect - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software, will release its fiscal first-quarter 2025 earnings report after the market closes on Wednesday, May 22, 2024. Analysts and investors alike are eagerly awaiting the results. The company has consistently outperformed expectations in recent quarters, largely driven by the surging demand for AI-related products and services.



Nvidia Expected to Bring in $24.65 Billion in Revenue for Q1 FY25



Wall Street analysts project Nvidia’s revenue to reach a staggering $24.65 billion for Q1 FY2025, a significant increase from $7.19 billion in the same quarter last year. The company’s net income is expected to soar to $12.87 billion, up from $2.04 billion a year ago, while earnings per share (EPS) are anticipated to be $5.17, a sharp increase from $0.82 in the year-ago period.



Nvidia has a track record of beating earnings expectations, having done so consistently in the past four quarters. The company’s data center segment has shown rapid growth, reaching a record high of $18.4 billion in Q4 FY2024, driven by the increasing demand for AI-capable chips and infrastructure.





Key Highlights and Investor Focus



Investors will be closely watching the performance of the data center segment, which is projected to achieve $21 billion in sales for Q1 FY2025. Updates on the highly anticipated Blackwell platform, Nvidia’s next-generation AI computing architecture, are also expected during the earnings call.



Market participants will be keen to gain insights into future performance expectations, particularly regarding the continued demand for AI-capable chips and overall market conditions. They will also focus on any revisions in earnings estimates and their potential impact on Nvidia’s stock price.







Do you think Nvidia will once again beat expectations with its Q1 earnings? Let us know in the comments below.

Empire Newsletter: Crypto’s day in Congress - Blockworks


What’s in a vote?
Meet the US Senate’s new Democratic crypto caucus — sort of.
Yesterday saw Congress’ upper chamber side with the House on a measure aimed at scuttling crypto accounting guidance created by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As Blockworks’ Casey Wagner reported Wednesday, the vote resulted from a behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign involving Republicans and industry advocates.
In the end, a dozen Democrats crossed the aisle for the 60-38 vote. When the House voted last week to undo Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, 21 Democrats joined Republicans. 
What to make of this group, and the relatively swift speed at which this effort took shape? 
Some of the group have been public about their crypto positions for some time. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, of course, co-authored legislation with Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming. Others, including Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have expressed support for the US crypto industry in the past. 
On the other hand, some yes-voting members have taken positions less popular with the industry; Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Mark Kelly of Arizona and John Hickenlooper of Colorado have all scored “very anti-crypto scores” from Stand With Crypto’s political rankings.  
Read more: Stand With Crypto PAC launches as industry interest in campaign funding ramps up 
One has to wonder how much the Biden White House’s veto threat factored into the Democrats’ decision to “vote their conscience” — that is, not align behind a particular yea-or-nay group strategy. 
Remember, several of the votes in question were cast by senators up for reelection this fall: Gillibrand, Casey and Tester. For these members, at least, the vote provides a way to create some daylight between them and an unpopular incumbent. 
The glass-half-empty interpretation: Biden’s stated plan to veto the bill made it a somewhat “safer” bill to vote on, given the preordained outcome. 
Of course, it’s always possible that Biden will reverse course and side with a decidedly bipartisan movement in Congress, but given that it’s an election year, such a move would be a surprising one.
I think there’s more going on here than political machinations, however. Despite the memes to the contrary, there’s always been Democrat support for crypto issues, albeit not at the fervor expressed by Republicans. 
It’s possible, quibbles aside, that the popularity of crypto has broken through and created a moment when Congress actually, against the odds, saw fit to move forward with crypto legislation. Sure, it took the form of an opposition measure, and yeah, it amounts to a won’t survive-a-veto messaging bill when Congress is essentially done working for the year. But they did it by a wider-than-expected margin, and that means something.
The upcoming election is about much more than crypto. But this week’s vote may mean that the next session of Congress could see real movement on crypto issues. 
And who knows — there’s still a few more months to go. Maybe Lummis’ and Gillibrand’s bill will get the attention and debate it has long deserved.
— Michael McSweeney

Want to transfer value almost instantly to the other side of the globe, for a fraction of the cost of boring-ass fintech unicorns like Wise and Revolut? Use Tether on a network like Tron or Polygon: frictionless, fast and easy.
How about raising funds for a new venture? Like a goat farm. All good — you can easily source liquidity and donations from around the world on social media and buy tons of goats, no questions asked.
It turns out crypto also does wanton pointless pumping much better than the stock market.
The normie crowd has come back around to meme stocks, about three years after the original /r/wallstreetbets craze. GameStop has pumped up to about 550% and dumped by nearly half over the past few weeks, all because that Roaring Kitty guy tweeted some silly cryptic on Twitter.
What goes up mostly comes down and stays down when it comes to meme stocks
Other popular memestocks from the COVID era of free helicopter money (stimulus packages) haven’t yet had the same treatment, for better or worse.
Whether AMC, Virgin Galactic and Kodak Eastman get their second moment is anyone’s guess. Still, GameStop’s recent 550% is cute compared to what happens around these parts. So is its peak-2021 pump of more than 5,400% (54x).
In the past five years — the same period as memecoin mania #1 and #2 — DOGE, FLOKI, WIF, BONK and SHIB have all, at their most, multiplied in price hundreds of times. SHIB however takes the cake, exploding by 80,000x (8 million percent).
Bitcoin, ether and Coinbase stock for scale (wink, wink)
Sure, there are some caveats: Many memecoins start trading from near zero, so any real market movement sends prices practically off the chart. Hard to compare that with already-listed stocks within the same timeframe. And stock market circuit breakers do tend to put a damper on things.
But don’t let that get in the way of a good time. 
DOGE, for instance, was launched in 2013 and it still went parabolic in 2021, far more than GameStop, Nikola or Hertz ever did.
In fact, if SHIB was included in the chart below, it would turn the entire meme stocks sector into a tiny, little, insignificant bubble. 
Sounds about right.

The Works

Hong Kong’s bitcoin and ether ETFs saw outflows earlier this week, shaking confidence in their debut.
Following yesterday’s exploit, Pump.fun said the attacker was a “former employee.” 
The Senate passed the resolution to overturn SAB 121, though President Biden has said he plans to veto it.
A Dolce & Gabbana customer is suing the fashion firm after it delivered NFT outfits late, Bloomberg wrote.
Biden’s order to stop a Chinese-tied mining operation came days after CleanSpark bought the sites, CoinDesk reports.

The Morning Riff
Former Alameda CEO Sam Trabucco has been notably absent from the aftermath of FTX’s downfall, though his name tends to pop up when discussing the collapse itself. 
Caroline Ellison, his co-CEO prior to his departure, took the stand at Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial though Trabucco didn’t appear once. He also hasn’t been publicly accused of any wrongdoing.
But yesterday, Trabucco broke his silence in a letter to the court ahead of ex-FTX executive Ryan Salame’s sentencing hearing. 
Trabucco’s letter is over three pages long and is….interesting, to say the least. Not only do we learn a lot about Salame’s home life (he hung 80 photographs of his new partner in his home after dating for a month) but we also get some insight into Trabucco’s time at Alameda. 
Simply put: Trabucco seemed unhappy with the hours and work at Alameda, calling Salame his “lifeline” through the “hardest period of my life.”
Obviously, we can’t know what happened behind closed doors and there are still many questions that remain unanswered about Trabucco’s role and the millions of dollars he walked away with. 
But he’s made one thing clear: He’s a loyal friend.

Antminer L9 Coming Soon: Will Change Litecoin and Dogecoin Mining? | Cryptopolitan

Antminer L9 is coming, with a more powerful and energy-efficient way for Scrypt mining. This hashing algorithm is key for securing the Litecoin network, while also producing Dogecoin. Scrypt miners will face a price tag above $16K, but a chance for higher profitability in mining LTC and DOGE. Bitmain is still the main source of mining rigs, and its new models drove the arms race among miners. Proof-of-work blockchains are still a thing, and new rigs offer more energy efficiency with improved performance, to offset environmental concerns. Antminer L9 to Be Released by the End of MayThe new Antminer Scrypt rig was pre-announced to arrive in May, but there is no set date. The new miner is not yet listed on the Bitmain site. Some vendors, however, have already listed the model for presale, with a price tag starting at $14,700. The new hashing power is not expected to affect Scrypt networks for months, as the first shipments are scheduled for June. Also read: Litecoin Price Prediction 2024-2030: Will LTC Price Hold $100?The Antminer L9 will produce up to 17.6 GH/s, competing with the overall growing mining presence for Litecoin.In the past three years, Litecoin’s mining has gradually grown, and activity is up by 500%. The hashrate is now 1.16 PH/s, breaking to a new range. But this level of mining is negligible compared to Bitcoin’s network. Also read: How is Litecoin a Winner? LTC Leads As Most Widely-Used Coin for Payments and Simple TransactionsHowever, for Litecoin miners, the relatively low competition allows for additional block creation and higher rewards. Litecoin is still between two halving cycles and its block reward is still 6.25 coins per block, with additional Dogecoin (DOGE) issued in every new block created. Is the New Litecoin Miner Profitable?The big question when investing in a mining rig is whether it would pay for itself through rewards and fees. The new Antminer L9 can be profitable, given cheap electricity and peak performance. However, the earnings are potentially around $1,000 per year, depending on different electricity prices. Litecoin and SCRYPT mining is differently profitable and depends on just the creation of new LTC. Other Scrypt-based assets may have different profitabilities. Are Scrypt-Based Tokens Still Relevant?Most Scrypt mining assets are relatively older, created soon after the launch of Bitcoin. Litecoin and Dogecoin are still the most significant and prominent ones. Other mined assets include Syscoin (SYS), MonaCoin (MONA) and ReddCoin (RDD), which survive mostly due to being tied to their online communities. Most Scrypt-based coins have trading volumes close to zero, and some are practically frozen and useless. Any new Scrypt-based hashing power would thus go to LTC and DOGE production, hardly affecting other networks. Mining Links to Web3, NFT ItemsThe old model of mining included the creation of coins, which were then held or sold to cover costs. In some cases, however, miners found other ways to retain value. The newly minted coins are used as collaterals to support the value of NFT or other types of tokens. Thus, not all LTC and DOGE would be sold. Some miners offer a share of their rig’s performance, usually in exchange for fees or for buying a specific NFT. Snekkies, one of the NFT projects on Cardano, is tied to a Scrypt miner, who also holds LTC and DOGE collaterals. LTC is a relatively stable asset, trading at $83.08. DOGE recovered above $0.15, and has also kept within a predictable range. Together, the assets have a loyal community of long-term holders, and are suitable as collaterals for riskier Web3 features. Litecoin Mining Still Hinges on Large PoolsLitecoin mining is impossible to do solo. Just like Bitcoin’s network, Litecoin mining is dominated by four of the largest pools. Most LTC is produced by Bitmain’s own Antpool, as well as ViaBTC, F2Pool and the Binance.com pool. It may be possible that the Antminer L9 would first be available and tested by Antpool, solidifying its leading position. Antpool controls 28.9% of all known hashrate, and discovers on average 16 of every 100 Litecoin blocks. Cryptopolitan reporting by Hristina Beeva.

Is onboarding too hard? Crypto adoption still faces major obstacles

Web3 has been the subject of speculation for many years now, and predictions about what will spur mass adoption are frequent, as are possible obstacles slowing the onboarding process. Some, like Web3 gaming execs, have speculated crypto market hype, and several highly anticipated blockchain games could be the key to mass onboarding. According to a Feb. 22 survey report from key management network Web3Auth, which had 3,378 responses from Web3 users, developers and decision-makers worldwide, respondents think there are still several issues that need ironing out before mass adoption can become a reality. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Robert Hoogendoorn, the head of content at blockchain analytics platform DappRadar, said he thinks two obstacles in particular need to be overcome: a “simplified interface and user experience” and an increase in general consumer knowledge about cybersecurity.“One of these has been improved heavily in the past few years, while the other could use some work. Did you know 60% of American consumers use the same password across multiple accounts?” he said. “That’s the same audience you want to onboard into Web3, and who will act surprised that MegaPepeBitcoinToken turned out to be a rug pull? That’s just one of the major challenges ahead of us.”At the same time, Hoogendoorn says it’s not uncommon for “technological advancement” to come with onboarding challenges. He thinks the Web3 industry has made “significant progress” in this area, though. “Onboarding in Web3 is a challenge. Insiders praise the technology, but for the end-user, it’s all about the experience,” he said. “Only now we’re reaching a point where Web3-powered financial services or video games reach a level of sophistication that could potentially onboard millions,” Hoogendoorn added.Respondents in the Web3Auth survey claim the top hurdle holding people back from adopting Web3 is concerns about security and risks to people’s assets. According to Hoogendoorn, the wider crypto industry has been “labeled a wild west for a decade, and that’s not something that goes well with the general public.” He thinks this perception of poor cybersecurity is an obstacle holding back users from Web3. Related: Web3 can benefit from adopting Web2 optimization: NBX BerlinCases such as the mainstream coverage of the FTX collapse and the subsequent Sam Bankman-Fried trial, where he was sentenced to 25 years in jail for fraud, have done little to help with this perception. Other high-profile crypto company collapses, such as the $10 billion Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital in 2022, have also contributed to the negativity that might be holding back mainstream users from onboarding into Web3. Rug pulls and hacks are also a thorn in the side of Web3. Over $200 million worth of crypto has been lost to hacks and rug pulls in 32 individual incidents so far in 2024, according to a Feb. 29 research report by blockchain security firm Immunefi.Education and positive PR may be the answerHoogendoorn believes the negative perception of Web3 will need to change to incite mass adoption of the tech, and that will likely require “lots of positive PR” from within the industry. A change is also required for the general public, with better education about best security practices. “In general, people are notoriously bad at managing their account names and passwords, as most of them don’t use 2FA and a big number uses the same password all the time,” Hoogendoorn said. “People value safety but don’t act responsibly. In Web2, this can cause issues, but in Web3, this can result in your money being stolen instantly. And when this happens, it — again — rubs off negatively on our industry.”Speaking to Cointelegraph, the BNB Chain Core Development Team said “multiple hurdles could act as blockers” when onboarding people into Web3. The most prominent are a lack of education and accessibility to unfamiliar user experiences or a lack of incentive mechanisms. Related: Web3 domains are an unassuming force in crypto mass adoption — Unstoppable Domains COO“Mass adoption of Web3 will likely be facilitated by several key factors, including user-friendliness, secure and reliable infrastructure and education,” they said. According to the team, Web3 can be difficult to navigate for those new to the space, so it’s important to “offer fun and engaging ways” to get involved, such as meme campaigns that offer incentives and rewards.Overall, the BNB Chain Core Development Team says robust infrastructure, user experience and performance are all critical for onboarding more Web3 users.“The path to mass adoption of Web3 will likely be gradual and multifaceted, involving innovative technology, user-friendly interfaces, and education,” they said.“The priority should remain on improving the usability of existing technology rather than relying solely on breakthroughs to aid the transition from Web2 to Web3.” Complex tech and uncertain regulations slow Web3 adoptionPavel Salas, the chief growth officer at the Gear Foundation — the organization behind the Gear Protocol — said onboarding into Web3 is complex and hard to understand for non-technical users. He told Cointelegraph Web3 applications are not always user-friendly, which poses a considerable barrier to adoption and can keep new users away. “Take playing an on-chain game as an example. Initially, users need to download a wallet and acquire the necessary tokens — these could be specific to the game or a general protocol token like Ethereum or Solana,” he said. “After setup, they face the ongoing requirement of paying for gas with each transaction.”Sami Start, co-founder and CEO of developer integration toolkit Transak, told Cointelegraph that onboarding from fiat to crypto is at a critical bottleneck. He says, “Less than 10% of global internet users own cryptocurrency, reflecting significant entry barriers.” According to a market sizing report from cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com, the global number of crypto users increased by 34% in 2023, growing from 432 million to 580 million people. Online data platform Statista estimates that as of April 2024, there were 5.44 billion internet users worldwide. Start says regulatory complexities and the varied integration with existing financial systems make the transition into Web3 daunting for new users as well. In May 2023, the European Council adopted the first comprehensive legal framework for the crypto industry.However, other countries and jurisdictions have been slower to create a framework for crypto, with some outright banning its use. Start also thinks because the Web3 space is fragmented with many blockchains and protocols, this can confuse users and limit the potential network effects that drive adoption.“As an industry, it’s imperative to streamline these processes, ensuring that converting fiat to crypto is as simple as any traditional online payment,” he said. “By addressing these challenges, we can make the blockchain’s transformative potential accessible to a broader audience and significantly increase adoption rates.”Speaking to Cointelegraph, Ken Timsit, managing director at Web3 startup accelerator Cronos Labs, said that for most crypto users, onboarding takes place on a custodial crypto exchange platform first. He says, “This step works very well nowadays because the top exchanges are regulated and implement KYC [Know Your Customer] controls.” Related: Aussie corporate regulator to build ‘outcome-based’ crypto policiesKYC is a set of steps crypto exchanges take during onboarding to verify customer identity and perform due diligence to understand financial activities and risks.Timsit says, “We would all like to onboard more mainstream users,” but he thinks an issue that needs to be addressed is how the tech is being developed; specifically, it needs to be geared toward mainstream users, not those experienced in crypto. “Many of the recent success stories, such as liquid restaking, modular scaling protocols and memecoins, have been driven by an experienced user base,” he said. “As a result, projects are currently incentivized to build primarily for OGs, whales and degens. At the same time, some mainstream users are still turned off by the lack of regulatory clarity.”

Bank of America Blames Customers, Ignores Law, Denies Fraud Claims Without Any Explanation or Proof Whatsoever: New Class-Action Allegations - The Daily Hodl


								A Bank of America customer just launched a class-action lawsuit accusing the lender of illegally refusing to reimburse legitimate victims of fraud.
Plaintiff Kimberley Dennie says she lost her BofA debit card in February and soon watched several unauthorized transactions hit her account.










Dennie says she promptly reported the card as lost or stolen and submitted a claim, which included a police report detailing what happened, to recover $3,000 that had disappeared from the account.
According to the lawsuit, Bank of America quickly rejected the claim and accused Dennie of authorizing the transactions without offering any evidence, as required by law.
“Despite Plaintiff’s request for an explanation and further review, and submitting a police report for the stolen card and fraudulent transactions, Bank of America mechanically rejected Plaintiff’s claim without performing a reasonable investigation and instead, issued form denial notices devoid of any factual findings or documentation from its alleged investigation…
It was Bank of America’s burden to prove that these disputed transactions were authorized – not Plaintiff’s – and its failure to do so is unlawful and unfair to Plaintiff and thousands of other consumers who have to bear the consequences of stolen funds in unlimited sums.”
The lawsuit accuses the banking giant of routinely and brazenly rejecting customers’ legitimate claims while sending out vague, boilerplate letters of denial.
“Bank of America fails to comply with its statutory obligations by failing to provide written explanations of its denials. 
Instead, Bank of America routinely denies claims without any explanation whatsoever, stating only its conclusion that a claim has been denied. Bank of America’s boilerplate denial letters flip the burden of proof onto consumers to disprove the supposed reasonableness of the Bank’s investigation. But [the Electronic Funds Transfer Act] puts the burden of proof on financial institutions to show that disputed charges were authorized.”
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in North Carolina, with the plaintiff seeking “actual damages, punitive damages, and an injunction on behalf of the general public to prevent the Bank from continuing to engage in its illegal and/or unfair practices.”

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsSo much for the GameStop meme stock revival—and the related meme coin surge, too.With GameStop’s recent share price gains all but evaporated, an unofficial GameStop tribute coin on Solana is similarly down after shooting to a new all-time high price this week. The GME token has dropped to a price of $0.0067, per data from CoinGecko, falling 69% from that new peak set on Wednesday.GME on Solana, which has no official affiliation with the video game retailer, had been trading flat for weeks after launching in January and seeing a brief surge of momentum in early February. Trading volume over the last 24 hours is down to about $65 million—about one-third of this week’s peak, matching the price dip.Even so, the GME token is still up a massive 1,080% over the past week.

At a current price of $20.50, GME shares are down 68% since the Tuesday peak, per data from Google Finance.GameStop’s share price spiked on Monday following the apparent return of Roaring Kitty, aka Keith Gill, the GME enthusiast who helped spark 2021’s meme stock craze. Other so-called meme stocks, such as movie theater chain AMC, also jumped this week, along with meme cryptocurrencies.But the buzz didn’t last, perhaps in part because Roaring Kitty hasn’t actually done much of substance since.

Trump Crypto Boom: Ex-President's Portfolio Soars 4,000% Amid Re-Election Frenzy


								Former US President Donald Trump has found himself at the epicenter of a cryptocurrency-fueled windfall.
Data from market intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence reveals that Trump’s cryptocurrency portfolio has surged by a staggering 4,000% – a gain largely driven by the meteoric rise of the “Save America” meme coin, affectionately dubbed “TRUMP.”

According to the report, Trump’s affiliated crypto wallet has been the recipient of multiple airdrops of the TRUMP token, the latest of which occurred just 30 minutes prior to the analysis.
These generous airdrops have propelled the wallet’s value from a modest $7.4 million to a staggering $9 million in a single day, with the TRUMP meme coin alone accounting for a remarkable $1.30 million of that increase.
Source: Arkham Intelligence
From Humble Beginnings To Crypto Dominance
Trump’s crypto journey has been nothing short of remarkable. As of January 1st, his wallet held a mere $142,500 worth of TRUMP tokens and $778,000 in Ethereum (ETH).
However, in the months since, his crypto empire has expanded exponentially, with the wallet now boasting nearly 580,000 TRUMP tokens valued at $5.8 million, and his ETH holdings growing to $1.30 million.
Total crypto market cap currently at $2.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView
The marketing director for the TRUMP meme coin, Steven Steele, expressed that this is a clear indicator of the support from Trump’s fan base and the broader crypto community.
It’s evident that he has fully embraced cryptocurrency, and this has undoubtedly contributed to the surge in popularity of the TRUMP token.

Trump Token: Political Influence Meets Crypto Speculation
Trump’s crypto windfall is not merely a financial anomaly; it’s a testament to the interplay between political influence and the speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market.
The former president’s pro-crypto stance, which includes a pledge to allow Americans to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions if re-elected, has galvanized his supporters and the broader crypto community alike.

The report notes that this unprecedented growth in Trump’s crypto holdings underscores the powerful influence that high-profile figures can wield over the cryptocurrency market.
As the 2024 election approaches, Trump’s crypto strategy and the support from his base could set a precedent for other political figures to leverage digital assets in their campaigns.
The TRUMP token’s increase in value highlights the unpredictable and speculative character of the crypto ecosystem, particularly when it comes to politically sensitive or meme-based assets.

MATIC price's breakout odds depend on THESE key metrics - AMBCrypto



Historical data using the MVRV ratio indicated a possible 31% hike for MATIC in the mid-term
Old tokens have refrained from moving – A sign that another correction might be unlikely

A crucial MATIC on-chain metric has shown signs that the token could be ready to reverse its losses of the last few months. At press time, MATIC was valued at $0.69 on the charts following a depreciation of 26.38% over the last  90 days.
The metric that flashed the aforementioned sign was the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The MVRV ratio determines if an asset is undervalued or overvalued, depending on investor profitability in the market.
At press time, the 30-day MVRV ratio for MATIC had a reading of -0.97%. Historically, the price of MATIC bounces when the metric is between -8% and -16%.
After the lows, come the highs
This, because many holders are holding at a price lower than the historical cost basis. Thus, instead of realizing losses, market participants may take advantage of the decline and accumulate. Most times, this results in a higher value.
On 14 May, the MVRV ratio was -8.22%. However, the price of MATIC rose from that zone, pushing the metric to a much higher level.
Source: Santiment
In February, when a similar thing happened, MATIC’s price went on to hit $1.20. In this market, history does not exactly repeat itself. However, trends tend to be similar.
Therefore, if the ratio breaks into the positive zone, it is likely that MATIC’s next target might be $1, considering that it is a key area of interest.
Whether MATIC would be able to hold on to the price depends on the holders. If some decide to book profits at the projected price, MATIC might retrace on the charts.
However, sustained demand at that level could trigger a further uptrend, one that could send the price to $1.30. However, this conclusion might sound too hasty without checking other indicators.
MATIC diamond hands are not quitting
Another metric AMBCrypto analyzed was dormant circulation. If the dormant circulation spikes, it means that tokens that have moved in a long while are being transacted. In this case, the token might face selling pressure.
However, a low reading of the metric seemed to indiate that long-term investors are sticking to HODLing, instead of liquidating. That was the case with MATIC.
If sustained, the price of MATIC might not fall. Instead, it will consolidate for some time before a breakout eventually comes to pass.
Source: Santiment
In the meantime, the ratio of on-chain volume in profit to loss fell to 0.42. Readings like this imply that most transactions involving the token ended up in red, rather than in green.

Read Polygon [MATIC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

From all indications, this on-chain volume in profit might begin to improve if MATIC validates the prediction above. However, should a change from the bullish bias appear, transactions in loss might continue to dominate.

BREAKING: Coinbase Announces New Altcoin Listing - Bitcoin Sistemi


In the statement made by the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, it was reported that the Drift Protocol (DRIFT) altocoin will be listed on the exchange with the experimental label.
In the official statement made by Coinbase, it was stated that the DRIFT token will be supported on the Solana network.


The experimental label is used by the exchange to identify high-volatility and high-risk assets.
DRIFT had recently entered the listing roadmap of the exchange. However, DRIFT is a newly launched altcoin and was distributed to users via airdrop yesterday afternoon.





A total of 120 million DRIFT tokens were distributed to users during the airdrop event, which corresponds to 12% of the total supply.
Interestingly, the developers followed a different way to distribute the airdrop in question. In order to avoid network congestion and also prevent early sales, they announced that they will give an extra bonus of 20% of their airdrop to users who do not request the first airdrop for 6 hours.

SEC Never Loses? Veteran Labels Ripple Case Mixed Verdict


In a notable development, the SEC has appointed a new director of the Chicago Regional Office, the commission’s second-largest regional office. Amid the backdrop of this appointment, the ongoing discourse around cryptocurrency regulation has been reignited.Crypto enthusiasts quickly questioned the new director's stance on crypto, hinting at the pervasive uncertainty within the industry about regulatory attitudes.However, Marc Fagel, a former SEC worker and specialist in security law enforcement, clarified that personal stances on crypto are irrelevant in such regulatory roles. According to Fagel, the primary focus for individuals in these positions is the enforcement of federal securities laws, not personal opinions on cryptocurrencies.Fagel’s remarks come at a time when the SEC's approach to cryptocurrency enforcement remains a contentious issue. Critics argue that the federal securities laws are outdated and frequently misapplied to cryptocurrency protocols and foundations. Fagel countered this criticism by emphasizing the SEC's track record in crypto enforcement actions, noting that the SEC has yet to lose a case on the merits. He acknowledged that the Ripple case was a mixed result but underscored that the courts have generally upheld the SEC's positions.SEC v. RippleThe Ripple case, presided over by Judge Analisa Torres, has been particularly significant. In her ruling on July 13, 2023, Torres determined that while the XRP token itself is not a security, the manner in which it was sold could constitute the sale of a security.Specifically, institutional sales of XRP were deemed unregistered offers and sales of investment contracts, while programmatic sales and other XRP transactions by Ripple were not.Currently, the Ripple case has moved to the remedies phase, with the SEC demanding a $1.9 billion fine, a figure the company contests, suggesting the penalty should not exceed $10 million.

Pump.fun has redeployed the contracts, and trading is now live with 0% fees for the next seven days.Memecoin launchpad Pump.fun said that a former employee was responsible for an exploit that took place on Thursday.This exploit led to the theft of 12,300 SOL, valued at $1.9 million at the time of the hack.In a post-mortem report posted on X (formerly Twitter), Pump.fun revealed that the former employee "illegitimately took access of the withdraw authority" and used flash loans on a Solana-based lending protocol to borrow SOL.Flash loans are uncollateralized loans that must be repaid within the same blockchain block, allowing the exploiter to quickly acquire a large amount of SOL without requiring upfront capital.The ExploitThe rogue employee exploited the borrowed SOL to purchase “as many coins” as possible on Pump.fun until the prices of these coins hit 100% on their respective bonding curves.In the Pump.fun ecosystem, bonding curves set the price of a coin based on its current supply, causing the price to increase as more coins are bought. Once these coins reached the maximum price point on the bonding curves, the exploiter gained access to the liquidity locked in these curves, which is the pooled funds supporting the trading and stability of those coins.By 17:00 UTC, all trading on Pump.fun was halted to prevent further damage. The platform stated that, "out of a total of $45m of liquidity in the bonding curve contracts, only ~$1.9m was affected."To compensate affected users, Pump.fun noted that the team "will seed the LPs for each affected coin with an equal or greater amount of SOL liquidity that the coin had at 15:21 UTC" within the next 24 hours.Pump.fun has since redeployed the contracts, and trading is live now with 0% trading fees for the next seven days.Since its launch in January, Pump.fun has seen its revenue surge to $22 million, data from DeFiLlama shows. On May 10, Pump.fun became the second-largest revenue generating platform in DeFi, surpassed only by the Ethereum Network.What is Pump.fun?Pump.fun is a memecoin launchpad platform designed to simplify the process of launching a token on Solana or Blast, making it accessible even to those with no coding experience.The platform allows users to create their own tokens within minutes, streamlining the initial launch phase by trading the new token along a bonding curve.According to Pump.fun, this approach helps "prevent rugs by making sure that all created tokens are safe," ensuring that each coin is a fair launch with "no presale and no team allocation."While that may be true, the system unfortunately did not prevent a flashloan attack.

Pepe Price Prediction as PEPE Drops 12% From Recent Peak – Time to Buy the Dip? / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Pepe (PEPE) price has been pulling lower since hitting fresh record highs earlier this week. Traders are wondering whether now might be the time to buy the recent dip, as PEPE has dropped 12% from its peak.Pepe spiked up to new record highs above $0.000011 earlier this week following GameStop icon Roaring Kitty’s abrupt return.The legendary retail investor was a leading figure in the 2021 meme stock rally.And his return to X for the first time since 2021 on Monday injected momentum into meme stocks and meme coins.But the Pepe price has since dropped back to just over $0.00010.Chart analysis suggests that it might be too soon to buy into PEPE’s latest pullback. Here’s why.Pepe Price Prediction – Time to Buy the Dip?
Despite the latest pullback, the Pepe bulls are still in control of the market.The meme coin continues to trade well above its major short-term moving averages, which have acted as support.Pepe also broke out of an ascending triangle structure earlier this week.Traders looking to go long might want to wait for the Pepe price to retest the upper bounds of this ascending triangle before placing their bets.Indeed, $0.00000920 will likely offer very strong support for the price.The Pepe price could rebound strongly from this key support level. Source: TradingViewPepe’s market cap of just under $4.3 billion suggests that there is plenty of room left for the meme coin to run higher in this bull market as it grows in popularity.Pepe bulls will hope the meme coin can one day rival Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).These top meme coins have respective $21.9 billion and $14.6 billion.Dogecoin’s official Twitter has 3.9 million followers, and Shiba Inu has 3.8 million.By contrast, Pepe has 650,000 followers, so it still lags by some distance in terms of popularity.Crypto Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice (DICE)
Pepe has a lot of upside potential, but few would expect it to 10x or more.Investors looking to make bigger profits in the 20-50x region should consider the often-overlooked investment strategy of presale investing.Upstart Web3 projects often sell their tokens at a discount to early investors.If presale investors can find high-potential projects, they can book huge profits.One presale project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is the new GambleFi ICO Mega Dice Casino.Mega Dice is a crypto casino that recently launched a presale of its utility token, DICE.The casino already has over 10,000 active monthly players and over $50 million wagered monthly, which ensures that demand for DICE will be strong.Indeed, strong demand is already evident in the success of the presale, which recently exceeded $1 million.At $0.075 per token, DICE has a $30 million market cap. That’s relatively low, considering the real-world adoption Mega Dice’s platform is already garnering.Mega Dice is already a market leader in GambleFi. As the sector grows, its coin could one day be worth over billions of dollars. DICE could easily be a 50-100x coin.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presale

Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and This Trump-Themed Memecoin Have Outpaced Bitcoin This Week - Benzinga

So far, 2024 has undeniably been the year for memecoins. Countless new tokens have been released, and a handful of them have touted gains to the magnitude of thousands of percent. Additionally, the hype does not seem to be dying down. The tokens continue to go up and, in this case, some are outpacing the broader cryptocurrency market. Don't Miss:Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and MAGA Coin (TRUMP) have all performed better than bitcoin this past week. These memecoins do very little to add actual value to investors and instead focus on leaning into their memes. Surprisingly, this has resulted in enormous amounts of attention and buying activity.Shiba Inu is one of the older memecoins still afloat in 2024. Started in August 2020, the token quickly soared as it received attention from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. This week, the price is up more than 7%, bringing its market cap to over $14 billion. Started on the ethereum blockchain a little over a year ago, PEPE is a memecoin based on the infamous Pepe meme from the early 2000s, which features a crudely drawn frog. The token has climbed the crypto charts, and currently sits in the top 25 tokens by market cap, boasting a total of more than $4 billion. This week, PEPE's price is up by more than 17%.Trending: Large boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets — has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?A somewhat lesser known, but equally as interesting memecoin is MAGA Coin (TRUMP). This token, created in August 2023, combines the community and low-utility aspects of memecoins with the avid supporters of former President Donald Trump. The token has performed extremely well in 2024 and is up nearly 70% this week. Bitcoin also moved up this week on the heels of soft inflation data on Tuesday and comments from Trump himself about wanting to help the adoption of crypto. The CPI report came in better than expected, with inflation showing a 0.3% month-on-month increase in April, below the 0.4% expected. Additionally, Trump spoke at an NFT event, saying, If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, you better vote for Trump." Combined, these events helped propel bitcoin from $60,000 to over $66,000 this week. Overall, bitcoin is up just over 6% this week. This means that each of the memecoins noted above has outperformed bitcoin, which has also performed exceptionally well. For comparison, the S&P 500 is up around 2% this week, and the Nasdaq 100 is up just over 2.5%. Read Next:

Hong Kong Tests China's Digital Yuan (e-CNY) for Residents


							

Hong Kong pilots China’s digital yuan (e-CNY) for residents



Residents have a 50,000 yuan annual limit



China aims to expand e-CNY’s role in global transactions




Hong Kong launched a pilot program allowing residents to use China’s CBDC, the e-CNY, for the first time outside mainland China. This initiative marks a significant step in China’s efforts to internationalize the e-CNY and potentially increase the yuan’s role in global transactions, according to Bloomberg reports.



Residents within designated pilot areas can now create e-CNY wallets using their local mobile phones through participating banks like Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. The program also allows users to top up their wallets via Hong Kong’s Faster Payment System (FPS), facilitating cross-border payments within the Greater Bay Area and other pilot regions in mainland China.



Speaking on the development, Eddie Yue, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, noted that Hong Kong citizens can load their wallets via the local FPS payment system, enhancing cross-border transactions with mainland China. 




“We will continue to work closely with the People’s Bank of China to gradually expand the application of e-CNY, enrich the range of functionalities” and promote the acceptance of the digital yuan by more retail merchants in both Hong Kong and China,” Yue asserted.




While adoption remains limited due to existing digital payment options and security concerns, the e-CNY user base has grown to 260 million since its initial pilot in 2020. This growth aligns with China’s broader ambition to internationalize the yuan, as evidenced by the increasing use of yuan-denominated payments reported by Swift in recent years.



Howard Lee, Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, clarified that tourists can also utilize e-CNY for transactions within Hong Kong. However, Hong Kong residents are subject to a spending limit of 50,000 yuan annually.









This program aligns with Hong Kong’s aspirations to become a hub for virtual assets. Recent initiatives include the launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the introduction of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges.



According to the Bloomberg report, China began using e-CNY for international trade settlements in 2023, facilitating transactions in commodities, crude oil, and minerals. This development highlights the expanding scope of the e-CNY’s applications.

Bitcoin and U.S. Stocks Show Increasing Correlation: Bloomberg Report | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to Bloomberg, the 90-day correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 index, a tech-heavy benchmark, reached 0.46 this week—the highest since late August. A coefficient of 1 indicates that assets move in perfect sync, while -1 suggests they move in opposite directions. Per the article, when the Fed began raising rates in early 2022, the correlation peaked at over 0.8, the highest since Bitcoin gained mainstream recognition.



Joshua Lim, co-founder of Arbelos Markets, told Bloomberg that investors are increasingly viewing crypto as a growth asset, valuing its technological capabilities and function as a value transfer mechanism. This perspective aligns Bitcoin more closely with growth-oriented assets like tech equities.



Bitcoin has been variously described as digital gold, an inflation hedge, and a store of value. However, its price volatility has challenged these narratives. The U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January directly introduced the cryptocurrency to a broader investor base.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Toby Winterflood, Chief Product Officer at CCData, said to Bloomberg that since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 has risen, which challenges its reputation as a store of value. He attributes Bitcoin’s recent highs to the maturation of these ETFs, which have rapidly grown to become some of the fastest in history. Bitcoin surged following the launch of these ETFs on January 11, reaching nearly $74,000 in March before stabilizing as demand cooled. On Friday, Bitcoin rose by about 2.3% to around $67,064, marking a nearly 10% increase this week. Year-to-date, Bitcoin has jumped approximately 60%, compared to an 11.73% rise in the S&P 500 and a 12.19% increase in the Nasdaq-100.

Lim pointed out that traditional investors started paying more attention to Bitcoin due to catalysts like US ETFs, its record high in March, and the halving event in April. Now, apparently, with these catalysts behind, the focus has shifted to the broader macroeconomic picture.



On May 15, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced yesterday that the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) rose by 0.3 percent in April on a seasonally adjusted basis, following a 0.4 percent increase in March. Over the past 12 months, the all-items index has climbed 3.4 per cent before seasonal adjustment. Despite this progress, Bloomberg says, several Fed officials have suggested maintaining higher borrowing costs to ensure inflation continues to decline, indicating they are not in a hurry to cut rates.

‘Soak my Deck’ captain Sam Trabucco sails in for Ryan Salame


No one seems to know the whereabouts of Sam Trabucco, the once-CEO of Alameda Research who purchased a multi-million dollar yacht named ‘Soak My Deck’ after Alameda embezzled customer funds from FTX. Nevertheless, he’s broken cover this week to pen a lengthy character reference for his criminal colleague, Ryan Salame.
For over a year, Trabucco has been completely silent amid a global manhunt. However, he thought his assessment of Salame’s character would be so helpful to a judge prior to signing a final punishment against Salame that he decided to reappear. 
In his letter, Trabucco qualified his analysis multiple times. He admitted, “Ryan is my best friend. He has also committed crimes.” Elsewhere, Trabucco states the obvious: “Ryan deserves to face the consequences of his actions — he intimately understands that.”

Sam Trabucco’s character reference letter for a criminal
Of course, Trabucco never admits to any wrongdoing himself in his three-page letter. He, unlike almost all other executives at Alameda and FTX, hasn’t pleaded guilty to any crimes. Incredibly, neither has any law enforcement agency in the US publicly announced any criminal charge against him.




For some reason, Trabucco thought a judge would find his rambling letter useful.
Ryan Salame: Lead of political election fraud at FTX
Salame, in addition to apparently being Trabucco’s best friend (who knew!), pled guilty to participating in three criminal conspiracies: making unlawful political contributions to US politicians, defrauding the US Federal Election Commission, and operation of an unlicensed money transmitter. He is asking for leniency and an 18-month prison sentence but will likely receive more. 
Salame had millions in liquid assets, a tavern, two Massachusetts properties, and a Porsche before he agreed to surrender substantially all his assets to authorities.
Trabucco studied mathematics and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he worked with Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and imprisoned CEO of FTX. The two originally met at a 2010 math camp at Mount Holyoke College. A few weeks ago, a judge in New York sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn.
Before working at FTX and its sister trading arm Alameda Research, Trabucco worked at a quantitative trading firm like several other FTX executives. Unlike Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison, who worked at Jane Street, Trabucco worked at Susquehanna. Trabucco received at least $25 million in compensation while working for Bankman-Fried.
