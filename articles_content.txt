Tether strengthens blockchain and stablecoin compliance with Chainalysis

The world’s largest stablecoin issuer, Tether, has recently enhanced compliance measures through the blockchain monitoring solution by Chainalysis.
In particular, the purpose of the collaboration is to create a custom solution to monitor secondary market activities. Let’s see all the details below.

Stablecoin news: Tether partners with blockchain data platform Chainalysis
As anticipated, Tether, the leading company in the digital asset sector, has partnered with Chainalysis, a renowned blockchain data platform, to develop a customized solution.
The purpose of the latter is to allow monitoring of secondary market activities.
The secondary market includes transactions involving USDT (Tether’s stablecoin) within a broader ecosystem, beyond direct agreements between Tether and its counterparts. 
The solution developed by Chainalysis allows Tether to systematically monitor these transactions, offering a clearer view of the USDT market.
This tool allows Tether compliance professionals to identify wallets that may pose risks or be linked to addresses involved in illegal or sanctioned activities.
The solution integrates various monitoring and analysis tools. These include sanctions monitoring, which lists in detail the addresses and transactions related to sanctioned entities. 
Furthermore, they include a categorization function that divides USDT holders by type, such as exchanges and darknet markets.
Finally, it provides a detailed analysis of the main USDT portfolios, allowing for a thorough examination of the movements of heavyweight investors. 
It also provides a illicit transaction detector, essential for identifying activities potentially linked to crimes such as terrorism financing.
Some statements regarding the new collaboration 
Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, commented as follows: 
“Collaborating with Chainalysis represents an important step towards greater transparency and security in the world of cryptocurrencies. Tether is committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity and this collaboration confirms our proactive approach in protecting our ecosystem from illicit activities.”
On the other hand, Jonathan Levin, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Chainalysis, said: 
“Tether’s proactivity in monitoring the secondary market of USDT, the most widely used stablecoin in the world, has the potential to transform the entire ecosystem and make it safer. The transparency of cryptocurrencies provides the opportunity to work with law enforcement to block illegal funds and discourage the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities such as terrorism and scams.”
Tether is committed to actively combating illicit activities in the cryptocurrency industry. The company collaborates with 124 law enforcement agencies in 43 global jurisdictions, promoting communication and information exchange to combat illegal activities.
The strict enforcement of compliance rules and prompt action against the improper use of USDT demonstrate Tether’s commitment to maintaining high standards and contributing to creating a safer environment for all participants.
Tether marks a record quarter with profits of $1 billion
Tether has recently recorded a record profit in the first quarter of 2024. According to a recent attestation report, the company reported a net profit of 1 billion dollars, with a total group net worth of 11.37 billion dollars. 
These results represent a significant leap forward compared to the 7.01 billion dollars recorded at the end of 2023. Furthermore, Tether reported the highest percentage ever of holdings in Treasury bonds.
These data highlight the strong growth of Tether Holdings Limited at the beginning of 2024. The company attributes its success to stablecoin issuers and reserve managers, who contributed 1 billion dollars to the overall result. 
Most of Tether’s profit comes from operations with US Treasury securities, while a smaller portion comes from positions in Bitcoin and Gold.
Regarding investments in Treasury bonds, Tether has increased its direct and indirect positions to over 90 billion dollars in the first quarter of 2024. 
The company has also included in the calculations the indirect exposures through reverse overnight repurchase agreements secured by Treasury securities and investments in money market funds.
This is the first time that Tether reveals its net worth, a gesture that underlines the company’s growing commitment to transparency. 
Furthermore, Tether has announced to keep 1 billion dollars as excess reserve, a buffer to support the stablecoin supply, bringing the total reserves to about 6.3 billion dollars.

Jack Dorsey's Block (SQ) Q1 2024 Shareholder Letter; Doubles Down on Bitcoin | Cryptopolitan

Jack Dorsey has certainly been an avid believer in Bitcoin and blockchain technology. His recent letter to Block Inc. shareholders keeps living up to his firm belief in a future where Bitcoin’s use cases are well refined. In his statement, Jack says he strongly believes the internet will have a native currency, and it’s just a matter of time before it’s achieved. In his Shareholder letter, Jack Dorsey expresses his ambitions for Bitcoin and Block. According to him, making Bitcoin more usable every day means seeing Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, realizing Satoshi Nakamoto’s original dream for the cryptocurrency. Jack Dorsey’s Block Inc. has always been heavily involved with Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. In the Q1 Shareholder’s letter, Dorsey defends Block’s interests in Bitcoin, saying that the company spends a lot of time on Bitcoin because it believes the world needs an open protocol for money, one that isn’t owned or controlled by any single entity. Block has since been deeply involved in developing the open protocol to help serve more people around the world. Dorsey dubbed down on Bitcoin, saying unlike other cryptocurrencies, Block is focused on Bitcoin because of its capabilities and intended use case. Other cryptocurrencies in the market seek to solve different problems that are not aligned with Block Inc.’s mission. Jack Dorsey’s Block Inc. Plans for BitcoinIn 2018, Block became the first publicly listed company to offer a Bitcoin product. Since then, the company has focused on making Bitcoin accessible, more secure, and usable on a daily basis. Jack Dorsey said these three core directives have been the company’s main focus since. Guided by the three core directives, Block Inc. built a simple app called Cash App that allows users to buy, sell, and withdraw Bitcoin. As a result of a successful launch, the app has generated 3.3% and 4.2% of Block’s gross profits in 2022 and 2023, with only 0.7% of related expenses. Jack closed his Shareholders’ letter with a huge announcement for the Bitcoin community, saying that, going forward, Block will be investing 10% of its gross profits from Bitcoin products into Bitcoin purchases each month. The Dollar-Cost Averaging approach will minimize the impact of volatility on Block’s Bitcoin assets.The company, in general, has had a good run with Bitcoin, being one of the first to incorporate BTC into its balance sheets. Jack Dorsey revealed Block’s Bitcoin holdings have more than doubled (160%) from $220 million initially invested to the current net value of $573 million.

Bitpanda: the crypto exchange has become a leader in Europe

Bitpanda closes its first quarter of 2024 with its position as the leading crypto-exchange in Europe, thanks to its offering of a whopping 411 cryptocurrencies. 
Not only that, through its B2B platform, Bitpanda Technology Solutions (BTS), these cryptos are also available to partner banks, fintech companies, (neo-)brokers, and cryptocurrency companies. 

Bitpanda: the leading exchange in Europe now offers a total of 411 cryptocurrencies, also available on BTS
Good news at home Bitpanda: the broker confirms to be a leader in Europe for its wide range of cryptocurrencies and more. 
And indeed, Bitpanda now boasts over 4.5 million European users in almost 30 countries, after a significant period of growth. Its leadership can also rely on its wide range of 411 cryptocurrencies, as well as 2,800 digital assets including stocks, ETFs, precious metals, and commodities. 
These cryptocurrencies (and all assets) have also been made available on the B2B platform, Bitpanda Technology Solutions (BTS), involving partner banks, fintech companies, (neo-)brokers, and cryptocurrency companies. 
Specifically, BTS provides the infrastructure to unlock trading for over 19.5 million customers across Europe.
In this way, traditional banks, fintech companies, (neo-) brokers, and cryptocurrency companies will be able to offer trading, investment, and custody services for every asset class in a modular way, integrating a modular and scalable trading infrastructure 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Not only that, BTS is an ISO 27001 certified platform and involves other features such as savings plans, asset-to-asset swaps, and crypto staking functionalities.
Bitpanda: the crypto-exchange and its B2B platform, BTS, conquering Europe
Bitpanda is expanding also thanks to the results of its new B2B platform, Bitpanda Technology Solutions (or BTS). 
In this regard, Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, CEO of BTS, said:
“When we launched BTS, we knew it would cause a significant disruption in the European banking space. Competition has never been so fierce for banking customers, as more and more people in Europe are taking an interest in their finances, even exploring crypto assets. With BTS, our partners get an authorized, modular, secure, and scalable trading infrastructure they can rely on in just a few months. Tokenization is here to stay, access to it is now the benchmark by which banks are measured, and this is what BTS enables them to do.”
Not only that, such growth and expansion of Bitpanda aims to conquer Europe, also from a regulatory perspective. 
Philipp Bohrn, CEO and Head of Regulation at Bitpanda, commented: 
“This extension of the license is another important piece of the puzzle. The corresponding law was only introduced in February 2023 and we received the relevant license less than a year after applying for it. Bitpanda is the first provider of virtual currencies to have all the necessary licenses to offer not only virtual currencies to its customers, but also financial instruments throughout the European Union. For us at Bitpanda, regulatory compliance is not only a fundamental part of our strategy, but also a key differentiating factor from other market operators. Bitpanda actively seeks exchange with regulatory authorities and will continue to do so within the framework of MiCAR.”
Q1 2024: important partnerships and 
Only in this first quarter (or Q1) of 2024, the Austrian exchange Bipanda seems to have acted strategically, aiming precisely to achieve the desired growth results. 
And indeed, right in January 2024, Bitpanda consolidated its long-term partnership with the renowned German football club Bayern Munich, becoming the exclusive crypto partner. 
Already with this collaboration, Bitpanda has secured a wide television visibility, being well represented inside and around the Allianz Arena. Furthermore, there is the opportunity to collaborate with the players as part of a broader branding commitment. 
When it comes to financial institutions, Bipanda has then entered into a new partnership with Raiffeisenlandesbank Niederösterreich-Wien (RLB NÖ-Wien) bank, to offer crypto trading together. 
Thanks to the new partnership, customers of the traditional bank RLB NÖ-Wien can access well over 2000 digital assets (such as crypto, precious metals, etc) through the mobile banking app “Mein ELBA”.
More recently, however, Bitpanda welcomed a new partner into its home: the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW), the largest federal bank in Germany. In this case, Bitpanda is involved in launching crypto custody services, through its “investment-as-a-service” infrastructure.

The Cryptonomist

Important crypto news for Jito, which has become the largest protocol on the Solana blockchain, with 10 million SOL, equivalent to 1.4 billion dollars in total locked value.
Let’s see below all the details. 

Jito reaches a prominent position on the Solana crypto blockchain
As anticipated, the liquid staking and MEV infrastructure project Jito has become the largest protocol on the Solana blockchain, with a total value locked (TVL) of 1.4 billion dollars.
With an equivalent of about 10 million SOL, Jito represents approximately 38% of the $3.7 billion TVL of the Solana ecosystem, according to DeFiLlama data.
The Marinade staking protocol is in second place with 1.37 billion dollars of TVL, followed by Kamino, Raydium, and Marginfi with 1 billion dollars, 613 million dollars, and 424 million dollars respectively.
In the liquid staking sector in general, Jito is among the top five on all blockchains, with 3% of the total TVL of 45.5 billion dollars. 
Lido dominates this category with 27.6 billion dollars, followed by Rocket Pool, Binance, and Mantle with 3.6 billion dollars, 2.6 billion dollars, and 1.4 billion dollars respectively.
Approximately 40% of Jito’s flagship liquid staking token supply, JitoSOL, is used as collateral in DeFi.
Lucas Bruder, collaborator of Jito Network, stated the following:
“This is just an inevitable step in the growth of Jito Network. It would not have been possible without the support of Jito supporters, JitoSOL stakers, and all the DeFi protocols on Solana, as well as the engineers working to make Solana an ideal place to build.”
Jito prepares to compete in the restaking market
Jito is also exploring the development of a restaking protocol, as reported by CoinDesk, citing four sources close to the matter. 
This positioning could allow Jito to enter the restaking market, which currently has a TVL of 15.2 billion dollars, with EigenLayer dominating with 14.7 billion dollars.
As for the TVL of Solana, we see that, after touching a minimum of 210 million dollars during the bear market of 2022, it has risen to 3.7 billion dollars, with a growth of about 150% since the beginning of the year.
However, it remains significantly below the all-time high of over 10 billion dollars reached in November 2021.
Jito’s crypto, JTO, reaches new highs 
JTO, the native cryptocurrency of the Jito network, is experiencing a period of strong growth. In the last few weeks, its price has increased by 10%, reaching 3.88 dollars, with a market capitalization of over 450 million dollars. 
This increase follows a recent fluctuation that brought the value of JTO above 5 dollars, followed by a sharp drop to 3.15 dollars, with a subsequent recovery that allowed JTO to rise over 20% from the April low.
Parallel to the increase in price, the open interest of JTO has risen significantly on all major cryptocurrency exchanges, with an increase between 20% and 45% on platforms like Binance, OKX, and Bitget. 
This increase in open interest is a key indicator of market sentiment, suggesting that the bullish trend may continue. 
Indeed, as we know, when open interest grows along with prices, it can indicate greater momentum and greater confidence from investors.
Jito offers a series of advantages to investors, including the possibility of converting SOL into JitoSOL to maintain liquidity and earn staking rewards, as well as obtaining additional benefits from MEV.
We remind you that MEV refers to profit opportunities resulting from transaction ordering, which can be exploited through arbitrage techniques. 
The Jito Foundation was created to address the challenges related to the EVS, promoting a fair distribution of profits and ensuring greater transparency. 
In addition, Jito has developed an open source validation client to promote greater competitiveness in the MEV extraction sector on Solana.

The Secret Behind How AI-Powered Ethereum Trades Made This Trader a Millionaire

Editorial Note: The following content does not reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions. 
With the introduction of artificial intelligence in the investment sector, people are changing the way they invest in volatile cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. An industry that once required traders to learn complex market dynamics and study the plethora of crypto projects can now be entered into with minimal knowledge and experience.
Among several hundred newly launched AI-based trading platforms, AlgosOne’s AI trading bot has been gaining popularity over the past months. The trading bot sets itself apart from its competitors by assuring a trade rate of up to 80% with minimal user input.
Naomi Ross – a corporate executive – is one of the many AlgosOne users who achieved remarkable results through Ethereum trading. Excited to see what AI-powered trading can do for you? Try out AlgosOne’s 14-day risk-free trial!

VIDEO

How Did Naomi Discover the Algosone AI Trading Bot?
Naomi Ross, at 45, is a high-ranking executive at a multinational corporation. Despite the success of her career, Naomi was keen to grow her savings beyond the limitations of traditional investment options. However, even outside the boardroom, being equally committed to her family, she barely had any time to explore financial markets and the intricacies of trading in her schedule.
After her brief research about the cryptocurrency space, Naomi’s attention was caught by Ethereum, particularly its evolving decentralized ecosystem and solid potential for institutional adoption. Yet, cryptocurrency trading of all sorts, due to its highly volatile nature and the need for constant market monitoring, seemed overwhelming.
Naomi’s initial attempt to enter the cryptocurrency market was met with the same challenges faced by many new investors. While looking for platforms, she came across AlgosOne – an AI-powered trading bot designed specifically for new traders with little to no knowledge about the industry. What initially intrigued her was the way AlgosOne implements artificial intelligence and machine learning in its core technology to manage investments.


The platform utilizes deep neural networks and natural language processing models, similar to GPT-4 and LLaMA, to digest and analyze various data sources. This data includes historical and real-time market information, price movements, relevant news articles, and social media sentiments. By analyzing these complex sets of data, AlgosOne’s AI is able to dissect the market and identify patterns and trends. This enables the trading bot to execute trades with an incredible success rate of more than 80% while minimizing the risk.
Her Experience Trading Crypto With AlgosOne
The primary factor that convinced Naomi to try out AlgosOne’s AI trading was the platform’s ability to carry out trades autonomously without the need for user input. Unlike traditional trading strategies that demand constant monitoring and active decision-making based on extended market analysis, AlgosOne offers a hands-off approach. This resonated with Naomi’s busy schedule, allowing her to focus on her career and family while AlgosOne did the heavy lifting, managing her Ethereum investments with a profit margin.

“Let’s be honest, initially, I was skeptical. AI managing my investments? That too in an extremely volatile asset like Ethereum? It sounded too good to be true,” confessed Naomi. “But the low minimum deposit requirement convinced me to give it a shot. At the start, I put in just $300 to test the waters. And honestly, the whole experience has been much simpler than I expected. I didn’t have to become a crypto expert – the AI took care of everything for me.”
AlgosOne is determined to make the user experience as streamlined and worry-free as possible. Investors are only required to register their accounts and deposit their funds. Beyond that, AlgosOne’s AI takes care of everything, meticulously analyzing the price action data for assets like Ethereum and capitalizing on optimal opportunities with precision. On top of the automation, to make crypto trading more accessible for new investors, AlgosOne’s minimum deposit is only $300.
To top it all off, the platform also provides a commitment-free 14-day free trial, which you can avail of right now!
Making Millions From Crypto Trading

“My initial doubts were soon gone when AlgosOne earned me far more profit on my $300 investment than I expected. I was genuinely surprised to see the trading bot perform so well with my nominal Ethereum investment,” said Naomi, sharing her experience.
AlgosOne’s success rate of over 80% for crypto trading, as well as other markets such as forex and stocks, is yet to be beaten by any other competitor platform. AlgosOne’s underlying infrastructure uses a data-driven approach and is able to shift to the market conditions. By analyzing the historical and current market data streams in real time, the AI is able to recognize price patterns across both shorter and broader timeframes.
Moreover, as the platform processes new information and experiences, the AI model refines its predictive capabilities over time. As a result, despite the rapid fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market, AlgosOne is able to pinpoint entry and exit positions as well as trade size for opportunities with optimal profit-to-risk ratios. 
For instance, even in high-risk market situations, where, let’s say, the win-loss ratio is 50%, the trading bot will smartly allocate only a small portion of the total investment compared to a much safer trade where the profit probability is about 90%. This adaptive nature of the platform enables it to maximize profits and minimize risk in rising and falling markets alike.
“Once I saw AlgosOne consistently turning a profit, I knew this wasn’t just luck. The AI was making smart decisions, and my returns were growing steadily. That’s when I decided to put more skin in the game and reinvest a larger sum,” remarked Naomi.


“AlgosOne’s trading tier system made perfect sense – the more I invested, the more benefits I unlocked. I could access bigger trades, which meant potentially larger returns. At the same time, the fees went down, much lower than most trading bots I came across. It felt like a win-win situation. And, let me tell you, that decision paid off in a big way. My initial investment grew  far exceeding anything I’d ever achieved with my traditional investment portfolio.”
Conclusion
Naomi Ross’s story – from scepticism to making money – is a testament to AlgosOne’s ability to empower traders, even those with no prior experience and knowledge, to achieve success in the cryptocurrency market. The platform’s approach to making trades based on in-depth market data analysis allows users to stay ahead of the curve and profit on fleeting market opportunities with minimum manual work.
“AlgosOne gave me the tools and confidence to navigate crypto assets like Ethereum, even with my busy schedule. The results speak for themselves.”

Therefore, he published a thread to clarify his prediction.Martinez explained that the correction Dogecoin is currently undergoing is normal for this meme coin and has been observed before DOGE broke into a bull run in the past. He referred to 2017, when DOGE broke out of a descending triangle pattern. In that year, the meme coin dumped 40% before it started on a massive 982% bull run. A similar scenario played out in 2021 – a retracement by 56% occurred before a 12,197% surge and the all-time high. Currently, Dogecoin has again broken out of a similar pattern and is expected to ignite a bull run.

Fear Back For 1st Time Since October As Crypto Greed Takes The Backseat


								The luster appears to have faded from Bitcoin’s crown. After a stellar run culminating in a record-breaking price in late March, the world’s leading cryptocurrency has experienced a sharp correction, plunging investor sentiment into the abyss. This sudden shift can be attributed to a confluence of factors, with the “Fear and Greed Index” playing a fascinating role in this rollercoaster ride, alongside a record exodus from a key investment vehicle.

Bitcoin And The Fear Gauge: A Delicate Dance
The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a sentiment analysis tool that attempts to capture the overall emotional temperature of the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 signifying “Extreme Fear” and 100 representing “Extreme Greed.” This psychological barometer plays a surprisingly significant role in Bitcoin’s price movements.

Source: Alternative.me
During Bitcoin’s ascent to its peak, the Fear and Greed Index hovered comfortably in the “Greed” zone. This instilled a sense of euphoria among investors, encouraging a “buy the dip” mentality. Every price drop was seen as a buying opportunity, further fueling the upward momentum.
However, the recent price plunge triggered a dramatic shift in sentiment. The index plummeted to a value of 43, firmly entering the “Fear” zone. This sudden lurch towards pessimism triggered a wave of panic selling, as investors fearful of further losses rushed to offload their holdings.

A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy? The Crypto Fear Index & Market Psychology
The Fear and Greed Index, while a valuable tool, can become a self-fulfilling prophecy in volatile markets like Bitcoin. When fear dominates the market sentiment, it can trigger a domino effect. As investors see the index dip, their own anxieties rise, leading them to sell their Bitcoin holdings.
This selling pressure then pushes the price down further, reinforcing the initial fear and prompting further selloffs. This cyclical pattern can exacerbate price corrections, creating a negative feedback loop.

Beyond The Fear: Market Fundamentals And Long-Term Outlook
While the short-term picture for Bitcoin appears gloomy, some analysts believe this is a necessary correction following the rapid run-up preceding the halving event. The halving, which reduces the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation every block, had fueled speculation and a buying frenzy. However, with the event now in the past, the market is adjusting to the new reality.
Adding Fuel To The Fire: Record Outflows From Spot Bitcoin ETFs
Further compounding the woes of Bitcoin is a record exodus from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On May 1st, a staggering $560 million net outflow was recorded from these investment vehicles.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price without directly owning the cryptocurrency. This record outflow signifies a significant loss of confidence among some institutional investors, potentially spooking retail investors as well.
Despite the current turbulence, long-term Bitcoin believers remain optimistic. They point to the cryptocurrency’s underlying fundamentals, such as its decentralized nature and limited supply, as reasons for its long-term potential. However, the road to recovery might be bumpy, and investors should be prepared for further volatility in the near future.

UK gov't calls for action on AI copyright, market competition

The United Kingdom government’s response to a parliamentary report on artificial intelligence (AI) resulted in a demand for closer intervention.A House of Lords February report on generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) highlighted the government’s narrowing focus on high‑stakes AI safety, which works as a deterrent to international competition.In response to the report, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, Michelle Donelan, clarified the government’s AI oversight is in line with most of the parliamentary recommendations. However, Lords Member Baroness Stowell of Beeston (Tina Stowell) wrote back on May 2, asking the U.K. government to “go beyond its current position” on the way it handles copyright infringement and market competition in AI.Baroness Stowell, the Chair of the Communications and Digital Committee, House of Lords, pointed out the need for updated copyright legislation. She said:“On copyright, the Government has set up and subsequently disbanded a failed series of roundtables led by the Intellectual Property Office. The commitment to ministerial engagement is helpful but the next steps have been left unclear.”Stowell further expressed her disappointment in the government’s lack of commitment to enhanced governance measures for AI standards and policy decisions. She also recommended policy discussions around oversight of market competition.“We reiterate our suggestion that market competition is made an explicit policy objective: it should be embedded within the design and review process for new policies and standards, and subject to structured internal and external critique.”The U.K. government’s recent response to the parliamentary signals a new acceptance of regulatory reforms for AI.

Cleverly cited crypto fundraising by groups as the rationale behind the new police powers.“These reforms will also enhance our national security. Terrorist organisations like Daesh are known to raise funds through crypto transactions and these updated powers will enable our agencies to more easily strip them of their assets.”The new regulations were implemented following the passage of a crime bill by the U.K. parliament in 2023, which facilitated the rapid seizure of cryptocurrency.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

Nigerian fintechs crack down on crypto, users face account blocks

Some Nigerian fintech platforms have warned users against connecting their platforms with crypto transactions or face heavy sanctions amid the country’s ongoing efforts to regulate cryptocurrency.Nigerian fintech firms Moniepoint, PalmPay and Paga have notified customers that their accounts will be blocked if they facilitate crypto transactions with them. This comes after the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) ordered some new banks, including Moniepoint, to stop onboarding new customers. In the notification issued to customers on May 2, 2024, Moniepoint said:“In line with CBN regulation, we will close the account of anyone engaging in crypto or other virtual assets transactions and share their details with relevant authorities.”This notification marks a reversal of the Central Bank of Nigeria’s previous announcement to lift the crypto ban imposed in 2021. In the CBN circular issued in December 2023, the central bank directed financial institutions to facilitate account opening, provide designated settlement services, and act as intermediaries for firms engaging in crypto asset transactions.Source: Tola Joseph FadugbagbeThe December circular also stated that it supersedes the one from 2017 and the one from 2021, which restricted banks and other financial institutions from operating accounts for cryptocurrency service providers. An X user, who is also a PalmPay customer, said his account was frozen and would only be unfrozen if he agreed to sign an agreement mandating him to abstain from crypto transactions.Related: Nigerian court postpones money laundering trial of Binance and execsPaga also emailed customers, stating that it is licensed by the CBN and that it is committed to compliance with all CBN regulations.“Pursuant to the CBN circular with reference FPR/DIR/GEN/CIR/06/10, we wish to remind you that dealing in or facilitating transactions in cryptocurrency and other virtual currencies is not permitted.”The circular referenced by Paga is from 2017, and it warns banks and other financial institutions about their relations with crypto exchanges and customers who transact cryptocurrency. The CBN had earlier denied a report saying it issued a directive requiring all banks and financial institutions to identify individuals or entities engaging in transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges and to ensure that such accounts are put on Post No Debit (PND) instruction — a directive issued by a bank or financial institution to restrict certain transactions on a customer’s account — for six months.The alleged circular also stated that regulated financial institutions engaged in crypto or facilitating payments for crypto exchanges are prohibited.

Friend.Tech's Native Token FRIEND Tanks to $2.5 After Airdrop

"Most users got 10x less airdrop than what they were expecting, so they are not even claiming that airdrop, as its less than 200$ for most of the retail investors," Malviya told CoinDesk in a direct message on X. "But at the same time few people ended up making crazy amount. So its a clear case of very concentred airdrop where leading creators took the most supply home through airdrop, leaving retail in disguise."

Michael Saylor Presents Bitcoin as the Best Crypto Asset


							

Michael Saylor describes Bitcoin as the best crypto asset, with no other second-best asset.



MicroStrategy CEO hails Bitcoin as the single solution for capital appreciation in an inflationary environment.



Saylor points out the key differences between Bitcoin and altcoins, highlighting the significance of proof-of-work-based consensus.




Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, the largest public holder of Bitcoin, spotted Bitcoin as the best crypto asset ever, with no other second-best asset. In a keynote address delivered at “MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations,” Saylor presented Bitcoin as the “single solution” for capital appreciation in an inflationary environment.



Saylor shared insights on Bitcoin’s price appreciation and continued monetization. Reflecting on Greek philosopher Archimedes’ words, “Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand and I can move the world,” Saylor added, “Bitcoin is the place to stand.” Further, presenting Bitcoin as “the best,” Saylor asserted,




 “There’s no more powerful idea than the digital transformation of capital… No force on earth can stop an idea whose time has come. This is an idea. Its time has come. It’s unstoppable. And so I’m going to end with the observation that Bitcoin is the best. The best what? The best.” 




Explaining the major differences between Bitcoin and alternative coins, known as Altcoins, Saylor highlighted the significance of proof-of-work-based consensus in the crypto space. Providing further details into the matter, the MicroStrategy Chairman used the example of Bitcoin ETFs and Ether ETFs. While Spot ETFs were approved and successfully launched, the launch of Ether ETFs still remains a question. He stated,




 “When Ethereum is not going to be approved, sometime this summer it’ll be very clear to everyone that Ethereum is deemed a crypto asset security, not a commodity. After that, you’re going to see that [for] Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano – everything down the stack.”




Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading below the $60k mark despite a slight recovery from the bearish track. Currently trading at $59,551, BTC has experienced a marginal surge of 3% in one day. However, the cryptocurrency has declined by 7% in one week and 10% in one month.

Important Ripple v. SEC Lawsuit Update: Here's How the Trial's Going


																TL;DR

Ripple contests the SEC’s classification of the “Fox Declaration” as standard evidence, arguing it’s expert testimony, which affects the legal proceedings.
Predictions suggest a possible $100 million settlement in case, potentially impacting XRP’s value and the broader crypto market.


Ripple Strikes Back
The legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) escalated recently due to a disagreement on one key witness’ testimony. The two entities can not find common ground on a statement from Andrea Fox (known as the “Fox Declaration”).
The company initially argued that the testimony represented an unsolicited expert opinion, while the regulator described the process as “standard summary evidence in support of calculations for disgorgement.” 
The Commission also claimed that the “Fox Declaration” consists of information derived from documents generated by Ripple itself, including tax returns and financial statements, which can be useful for determining the case’s outcome.
Most recently, the firm filed a letter in further support of its initial request. It maintained that the SEC failed to show that the “Fox Declaration” is summary evidence rather than expert testimony. 




“Fox is an expert because she purports to use technical or other specialized knowledge to help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. She does not merely apply basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records, as the SEC contends.
 Rather, she analyzes Ripple’s records, third-party evidence, and expert reports; draws inferences and conclusions about those documents; and calculates disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and discount amounts based on her analysis.”
The company went further, arguing that even if Andrea Fox could be classified as a summary witness (rather than an expert), the SEC failed to disclose her before the end of the discovery process.
Having that said, Ripple insisted that the testimony should not be taken into account when determining the case’s resolution. 
Is a Settlement on the Horizon?
Despite the start of the trial, it remains unclear when the Ripple v SEC case will be officially closed or whether the parties will shake hands on a mutual agreement. One person who predicted the second scenario is the American lawyer, Jeremy Hogan. He thinks the lawsuit may draw to an end this summer following a $100 million settlement.
“I’m saying that the Judge will order 0 disgorgement but throws the SEC a bone and orders Ripple to pay a $100 million penalty,” Hogan stated.
Recall that the watchdog sought a $2 billion fine on the company alleging XRP sales violations. The latter insisted that the penalty should not exceed $10 million.
The outcome of the case might trigger a substantial price rally on Ripple’s native token and the entire crypto market (in the event of a decisive victory for the firm). On the other hand, the sector could be negatively affected if the SEC emerges victorious.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Eyes $60K, Toncoin (TON) Soars 12% Daily (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price recovery attempts continued in the past 24 hours as the asset neared $60,000 for the first time in days but failed to overcome that line.
The altcoins are also slightly in the green, with ETH closing down on $3,000, while SOL has neared $140.
BTC Goes for $60K
The primary cryptocurrency experienced several quite brutal days in which its price dropped by more than eight grand. It all started quite positively actually as BTC soared to nearly $65,000 during the early trading days of the Morning Asian session.
However, the bears intercepted the move at this point and propelled the first decline of many. In a matter of hours, bitcoin found itself dumping to under $62,000 and to $60,000 later that day.
The pressure kept mounting and BTC lost that physiological support level. This culminated in another massive nosedive that drove the cryptocurrency to a multi-month low of $56,500 on Wednesday morning, ahead of the highly-anticipated US FOMC meeting.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


Once that concluded, BTC jumped by two grand as the Fed said it will not raise the interest rates any further, but lost those gains immediately. It wasn’t until yesterday when the asset finally started to regain some traction and pumped to $60,000 hours ago.
It was stopped there and was pushed down to about $59,200 as of now. Its market cap has increased to $1.166 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts is slightly above 50%.

TON Steals the Show
Most altcoins suffered quite badly as well at the start of the business week but charted impressive gains yesterday. Some, such as Toncoin, have doubled down. TON has soared by nearly 12% in the past 24 hours again and now sits above $5.3.
HBAR, IMX, PEPE, TAO, and CRO have also produced impressive increases in the past day.
Ethereum is close to $3,300 after a 1.5% daily increase, SOL has neared $140 following a 3.7% surge, and DOGE is above $0.13 after gaining 4%.
The total crypto market cap has recovered another $40 billion since yesterday and is up to $2.330 trillion on CG.

R. Kiyosaki warns ‘the crash has begun’ and it is ‘a bad one’


Amid his numerous warnings of an upcoming financial crash, famous investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ Robert Kiyosaki has now shifted the narrative, stating that the crash has already begun and listing his rules to remember during this time.
As it happens, Kiyosaki specified that the bad news was that this crash “will be a bad one,” but the good news was that “crashes are the best time to get rich,” as “bargains will float to the surface,” according to the X post that the popular finance educator published on May 3.
On top of that, he offered the six main rules to remember in a crash, which include:


#1 Don’t catch falling knives
According to Kiyosaki, patience is a virtue, and greediness is a flaw during a crash, even when there are bargains are dropping left and right, therefore he advises “just because prices are falling, do not get greedy,” and “wait until prices have bottomed and no one wants the asset you want.”

For instance, in late March, Kiyosaki highlighted that the price of silver at the time was still well below its all-time high (ATH), praising it as the best bargain as it was “not only a precious metal” but also “an industrial metal and a strategic metal” with soaring demand due to wars erupting all over the world.
#2 Study
As someone who has always touted the importance of financial education, Kiyosaki believes it is particularly important during a crisis, recommending YouTube as a “great source for real and fake teachers” and to “invest time to get into the heads of the teacher.”
Indeed, he earlier warned that fiscal stupidity and lack of financial education in the United States were the biggest threats to the country, referring to traditional teachers as bureaucrats who lack the competence to teach their students about finances and the economy.
#3 New friends
Furthermore, Kiyosaki urges his followers to “seek new friends who are on the same path you are on.” In other words, he advises staying away from victims – “people who blame others for their problems,” and Marxists – “people who expect the government to solve their problems.”
Specifically, he has earlier slammed the current government in the US, headed by President Joe Biden, as ‘Marxist,’ arguing that they  “took over the US in the 2020 election [and]will raise property taxes, impose rent controls, as rising interest rates decrease property values.”
#4 Start a side hustle
Also, he praises self-sufficiency, which involves owning “your own business,” particularly as artificial intelligence (AI) “is going to wipe out millions of jobs.” Hence, he recommends starting a small business and becoming an entrepreneur instead of being an “employee afraid of losing their job.”
Indeed, Kiyosaki has argued that a side hustle may “provide you income (…) as the economy crashes, stock markets go bust, pensions crash and unemployment rises” and might even “grow into the next Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) or Bitcoin (BTC),” as Finbold reported in late 2022.
#5 Choose great teachers
Closely connected to his rule #2, Kiyosaki believes that “YouTube has an abundance of teachers, some good, many bad,” telling his followers to choose his own teachers, including Ken McElroy for real estate, Tom Wheelwright for tax strategy, John MacGregor for stocks, and Mike Mauceli for oil, adding:

“Be careful who influences your brain, your attitude, and your spirit.”

As a reminder, he has earlier admitted that his whole family were school teachers, arguing that this is how he knew that “they’re all basically bureaucrats [and financially] stupid,” and that, as such, no one should trust school teachers or take financial advice from them.
#6 Don’t save money
Finally, he argues against saving “fake money” or fiat currencies like the US dollar, Euro, Yen, or Peso, as it “goes down in value,” suggesting instead to “save gold, silver, [and] Bitcoin,” in other words, “real money that goes up in value, especially in a market crash.”
In fact, Kiyosaki has previously pointed out that “the rich save gold, silver, Bitcoin” while “the poor and middle class want jobs that promise a steady paycheck but offer no job security,” and “fake $,” which they invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, & [exchange-traded funds (ETFs)].”
Conclusion
All things considered, Robert Kiyosaki has long warned about the looming threat of a worldwide financial collapse, particularly in the US, where the “fake” dollar is eroding the global dominance and pushing the American empire to its end.” However, only time will tell if and just how correct he was in his predictions.

Bonk: The Solana Meme Coin Phenomenon Shaking Up the Crypto World - Brave New Coin

The meme coin named Bonk Coin, based on the Solana blockchain, has gained significant attention and stirred up the cryptocurrency market.
Bonk is a type of meme coin, similar in spirit to Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, but it operates on the Solana network, which is known for its high-speed transactions and lower costs compared to Ethereum.
Bonk reportedly gained traction as a reaction to the perceived centralization and venture capital influence in the Solana ecosystem. It was distributed in a unique manner, with a significant portion of its total supply given away to Solana users, NFT projects, and developers, ostensibly to foster a more community-focused approach.
This token experienced substantial volatility shortly after its launch, showcasing both rapid increases in value and sharp declines, typical of many meme-based cryptocurrencies. This volatility reflects the speculative nature of such assets, where market prices can be heavily influenced by social media trends, community sentiment, and influencer endorsements.
What is Bonk Coin?
Bonk coin is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, designed to promote fair distribution and reduce the perceived centralization and venture capital influence in the Solana ecosystem.
When was Bonk Coin created?
Launched on Christmas Day, December 25, 2022, Bonk coin was initially distributed as a free airdrop specifically targeted at the Solana community. This strategic move was aimed at fostering widespread adoption and encouraging community participation within the Solana ecosystem
How does Bonk work?
As a meme coin, Bonk relies heavily on community involvement and sentiment. It leverages a decentralized approach where decisions can be influenced by community votes, especially through mechanisms like a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This ensures that token holders can have a say in significant decisions regarding the project’s future.
Bonk Use Cases
While initially starting as a meme coin, Bonk aims to expand its utility in various ways:
Tipping and Microtransactions: Users can use Bonk for small transactions or as a tipping currency within the Solana ecosystem, encouraging interactions and rewards among community members.
Participation in DeFi: Bonk can be integrated into various DeFi platforms for staking, lending, or liquidity provision, providing its holders with opportunities to earn interest or other rewards.
NFT Marketplaces: Bonk coins might be used in NFT marketplaces integrated with Solana for buying, selling, or trading digital assets, enhancing its utility beyond mere speculation.
Bonk Current Tokenomics

Circulating Supply: 65.19 trillion BONK
Total and Max Supply: 93.53 trillion BONK
Current Market Cap: $990.72 million


Bonk Tokenomics Distribution 
Choosing the Right Wallet for Your Bonk Coin and Other Tokens

To manage your Bonk coin and other digital assets, selecting a wallet that best fits your security and functionality needs is crucial. Whether you prefer a wallet dedicated to the Solana ecosystem or a more versatile multi chain wallet, there are several reliable options available:
Phantom Wallet: Ideal for those heavily invested in the Solana network, Phantom Wallet allows for efficient management of Solana-based assets like Bonk coin. It supports various DeFi and NFT functionalities integral to the Solana blockchain.
Klever Wallet: For those seeking a multi-chain wallet, Klever offers a comprehensive solution with support for multiple blockchains. Klever Wallet is available as a mobile app, browser extension, and even a hardware wallet, catering to various levels of security needs. This makes it an excellent choice for managing a diverse portfolio, including Bonk coin, with features facilitating easy swapping and secure storage. For more information, check out the Bonk Wallet on Klever Wallet’s website.
Trust Wallet: As a user-friendly multi chain wallet, Trust Wallet supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies across different blockchains, making it ideal for those who prefer having all their assets in one place.
MetaMask: While primarily known for its integration with Ethereum, MetaMask also supports other blockchains through custom RPCs, making it a flexible option for managing a variety of tokens.
By choosing a wallet that aligns with your needs, whether it’s focused on a specific blockchain like Solana or supports multiple chains, you can ensure that your cryptocurrencies are secure and accessible. Always remember to keep your private keys and seed phrases in a secure location and consider using additional security measures like two-factor authentication to protect your assets.

SHIB Shows Meme Token Resilience, Hard Fork Expected to Add New Features | Cryptopolitan

SHIB survived the worst of this week’s correction, and even briefly rallied along with Dogecoin (DOGE). But SHIB goes beyond the pure meme narrative of tokens like BONK, SLERF, Dogwifhat and FLOKI. SHIB traded at $0.000023, its mid-range level for the past month. SHIB also shows it can rally from every dip in the past weeks, with trading volumes often surpassing $1B. The momentum from the past days may extend and cover the weekly loss gap for SHIB.Shiba Inu remains a volatile project with inherent risk. But it is also one of the meme coins with the highest ambition to also become a Web3 hub, serving decentralized finance, as well as games and NFT collections and airdrops. Shiba Inu Prepares for Two-Stage Hard ForkShuba Inu completed the first stage of the Shibarium hard fork, planned for May 2 at block height 4,504,576. The Bor hard fork, as it is known, improves the efficiency of block production and communication between block operators. After the hard fork, the Shibarium network will introduce a small lag to synchronize nodes and avoid conflicting states of the blockchain.The second stage, the Heimdall hard fork, was scheduled for May 3, 12:30 EST, at block height 3,941,864. The Heimdall fork has improvements for the finalizing layer of Shibarium, where transactions become truly immutable. What is the Shibarium NetworkThe Shibarium network is gaining importance as the native transaction layer for the ShibaInu project. The network already carries more than 1.7M wallets, while SHIB tokens on the Ethereum network are held in 1.4M wallets.As of May 2024, SHIB is a two-chain token, but it still requires manual bridging from its various versions. Shibarium also tries to optimize fees so that its network becomes more attractive. Nonetheless, people continue to use SHIB in its Ethereum-based version for trading, allowing them to deposit it into centralized exchanges.The Shibarium network is supported by 100 Validator Nodes. Each node operator must hold at least 10,000 BONE tokens, often collected from the community of delegators. Validator nodes payout rewards and try to retain delegators with favorable payouts.SHIB Shows Signs of GrowthShiba Inu is now working to grow the Shibarium ecosystem and turn it into a successful scaling solution. Shiba Inu is also going through a fee-burning program, which also indicates usage levels. In April, Shiba Inu achieved the highest burn rate for the past three months, showing an expansion of transactions. The project has integrated Ethereum’s Shanghai hard fork upgrades and will keep evolving with future hard forks. The network’s growth and upgrades serve to remove the status of a non-serious project, as SHIB aims to have utility and multiple use cases. Already, Shibarium carries several small emerging DEX markets, as well as a Shibarium domain name service, similar to Ethereum addresses.Shiba Inu Prepares for Privacy LayerShiba Inu added a new token to its portfolio, the reward asset TREAT. The intention was for TREAT to work through a confidential layer of the Shibarium network. TREAT is added to the whole Shiba Inu ecosystem of tokens, which includes SHIB, BONE, LEASH, as well as the SHI stablecoin. Shiba Inu found additional funding for the TREAT token, raising $12M in April. TREAT also draws in new buyers from other blockchain projects.The TREAT token launched in 2023 and started active trading in March, when it reached its all-time high. On May 3, TREAT traded at $0.00085, showing its ability to bounce and achieve significant gains in the short term.

Friend.Tech Upgrade Launches With Native Token in Epic V2 Push



Decentralized social network Friend.Tech just bagged a new upgrade by pushing out its new naive token for trading on its native decentralized exchange on the Base network. According to DexScreener, the new token is currently trading at $3 with a total circulating supply of 14.5 million.

It was earlier rumored that Friend Tech is possibly considering introducing a non-transferable token with the ticker POINTS. The information was based on a leaked smart contract related to the version 2 launch of Friend.Tech, scheduled for May 3. Aside from the POINTS token, the V2 launch was expected to come with a new smart contract feature called Clubs.
“New smart-contract called Clubs. Anyone can create multiple clubs and a bonding curve among several options,” said @Cbb0fe, the X user who first talked about the token launch. “1.5% platform fee and 1.5% staking contract. Club keys are bought with $POINT.”




The token airdrop eventually coincided with the launch of Friend.Tech’s version 2 and it came with the Clubs feature.
The 1.5% fee on every transaction will go to liquidity providers on its DEX. Users are required to join one Club and follow a minimum of 10 users on Friend.Tech to gain access to their airdropped POINTS token. With the launch of POINTS, Friend Tech’s  native token FRIEND has slumped to $2.5, down from a high of $169.
Friend.Tech Suffers Sign Drop in Transaction
This V2 launch marks a re-emergence for the Web3.0 social media platform after it dealt a huge blow a few months ago. The protocol was launched in August 2023 after which it generated protocol fees of $1.42 million within just 24 hours. At this time, DefiLlama data confirmed that the achievement placed Friend Tech ahead of Tron and Uniswap.
This further highlighted its development as an emerging prominent protocol in the crypto space. In a period of two weeks, the platform allegedly registered over 100,000 users and generated about $25 million. Friend Tech’s core proposition lies in its novel approach to turning social connections into tradable assets. Users can tokenize their social networks by purchasing shares of other users’ profiles.
Unfortunately, the network saw a significant drop in transactions in less than one month of its official launch. Its daily fees plummeted on August 26 by about 87% and rested at $225,000. Daily trading volume on the platform plunged from $16.9 million to $953,000. Transactions on Friend. tech also fell by over 90% from its peak on August 21.
This bearish outlook impacted negatively on the decentralized social network. Even the former President of Polygon Labs Ryan Wyatt justifiably described Friend.Tech as a Ponzi scheme that cannot retain customers.


The relaunch is likely a major step towards correcting the negative narrative surrounding Friend.tech.

Ripple Will Lose Motion To Stop The SEC’s Opposition Filing - Lawyer


							

Bill Morgan, thinks Ripple will lose its “Motion to Strike” filing in the ongoing lawsuit against the SEC.



Morgan believes the Judge would accept Adrea Fox’s evidence and allow Ripple to depose her.



Ripple filed a letter supporting its April 22, 2024 motion to strike new expert materials.




Foremost crypto lawyer Bill Morgan thinks Ripple will lose its “Motion to Strike” filing in the ongoing lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Morgan highlighted this in a recent post on X, noting that he believes the Judge will accept the SEC’s summary witness Andrea Fox’s evidence as an expert and permit Ripple to depose her.







According to Morgan, following the series of events, the public can wait to see what the SEC would say on May 6 in its reply brief on remedies and await the Court’s remedies decision. Morgan’s post followed reports that Ripple had filed a letter supporting its April 22 motion to strike new expert materials. The letter also serves as a reply to the SEC’s April 29 opposition to Ripple’s earlier motion to strike.



In the referenced letter, Ripple highlighted that the SEC failed to show that Fox is summary evidence rather than expert testimony. The fintech firm also argued that the witness’s testimony was not timely under the Court’s scheduling order.



In further explanation, Ripple noted that the SEC does not dispute that if Fox is an expert, it had to serve a report from her during remedies discovery. The blockchain firm also highlighted that the parties’ agreement and the Court’s scheduling order required the SEC to disclose Fox before the close of discovery, citing a joint letter by the parties.









Ripple is in a prolonged litigation with the SEC over its XRP sales over the years. The case has directly impacted XRP’s price, following unstable sentiments among the XRP community. On Thursday, the top altcoin surged about 4% in a surprise move as the community anticipated Ripple’s latest filing.  



XRP traded for $0.51873 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView, with the crypto market showing signs of a momentum loss going into the weekend.

Bold Statements About Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Altcoins from Bitcoin Bull Michael Saylor! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The long-standing debate about whether Ethereum is a commodity or a security was recently brought to court.
While the SEC claims that ETH is a security, Ethereum development company Consensys recently stated in the lawsuit it filed against the SEC that ETH is not a security.



At this point, while many comments have been made about ETH, the latest evaluation came from MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, known for his support for Bitcoin.
Saylor, who made surprising statements about Ethereum, claimed that ETH is a security.





Speaking at the MicroStrategy World 2024 conference yesterday, Saylor argued that the largest altcoin is a security, not a commodity.
Michael Saylor went further, stating that the SEC will classify Ethereum as a security this summer and reject spot Ethereum ETFs.


Saylor believes that the SEC will classify many altcoins other than ETH as securities, such as BNB, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP.

“Ethereum should be considered a security, not a commodity. After ETH, you will see that many altcoins such as BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano are also unregistered securities.”
The SEC will not approve any spot ETH ETFs. Ethereum and other altcoins, which are securities, will never be accepted by Wall Street. “None of them will be accepted as cryptocurrencies by mainstream institutional investors.”

After these statements, the famous name also touched upon Bitcoin and argued that Bitcoin is the only leading cryptocurrency in institutional acceptance. Saylor described BTC as the “only universal” cryptocurrency suitable for institutional-level investments and added that there will be no other cryptocurrency than Bitcoin.

Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patent

Crypto community members expressed differing opinions as Ethereum Name Service (ENS) officially challenged a United States patent granted to Unstoppable Domains (UD) in January 2023. On May 2, ENS petitioned the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to challenge the validity of the UD patent. The company said that this move aims to ensure that the web “remains a collaborative space.” Source: ENSENS believes that UD has patented the technology that they pioneered. “This isn’t flattery — it’s theft. We have to fight this to ensure that ENS remains unrestricted for all,” ENS wrote.ENS also added that their organization “thrives on decentralization and public benefit.” According to the firm, the UD patent threatens to distort or destroy their core vision and beliefs. This includes the belief that core web functions must be free and not barricaded by patents. Some crypto community members supported ENS’ move against UD, while others argued against the petition. Cinneamhain Ventures’ Adam Cochran believes that the UD patent is not valid. Cochran argued that blockchain names, which were designed by ENS, must remain a perpetual public good and open intellectual property. “One of the critical values in this space is building in the open and not creating IP capture,” Cochran added. Decentralized finance (DeFi) advocates at the DeFi Education Fund also expressed their support for ENS. The organization said that it aligns with ENS in advocating and advancing open-source protocols. But a crypto community member argued that ENS has “nothing left for them but to attack UD.” The X user alleged that ENS “incite their friends not to work with UD” and said that the organization exhausts investors with high fees. Another X user said that this is an attempt from ENS to gaslight. The community member argued that patents are not granted without due process. The X user also urged ENS to keep the petition on the court and not on X. Related: ENS data from Etherscan now visible in Google search resultsUnstoppable Domains founder Matthew Gould responded to ENS on X and said that ENS was cited on the patent along with other blockchain domain systems. The UD founder said that the patent was reviewed with these citations and is valid.

Update! EIGEN Foundation makes new announcements on EIGEN Stakedrop | Cryptopolitan

Opinions on the EIGEN Stakedrop have flooded Crypto Twitter after its recent launch. Some excited, some cautious, and all in all, the Eigen Foundation is continuing to benefit from large media coverage and engagements on Twitter. The Eigen Foundation recently launched the EIGEN token and released a detailed outline for its stakedrop. However, after the announcements, the community responded back to the Eigen Foundation with multiple complaints about the high gas fees and a stingy approach to EIGEN token distribution, among others. Today, the Eigen Foundation has responded to the valuable feedback from its community and there’s some good news for those who’ve been interacting with EigenLayer. In response, the Eigen Foundation will be giving away an additional 100 EIGEN tokens to more than 280,000 users. The tokens will, however, only be available to those who’ve interacted with EigenLayer before April 29th. According to the update, the tokens will be reflected in allocations claimed after May 10th. The team will conduct an operation to filter out possible Sybil accounts, before rewarding Season 1 users with 10 EIGEN tokens (floor) and a (boost) of 100 EIGEN tokens. Eigen has made adjustments to meet community demands, highlighting that the foundation had already made plans to push for broader distribution. Eigen’s response, by allocating more EIGEN tokens for the stakedrop aligns with their mission, claiming that all they had to do was to accelerate the plan into Season 1 to accommodate community needs. Eigen Foundation’s Additional Clarifications The Eigen Foundation also had to make important clarifications on the processes mentioned when announcing the Stakedrop. The three major areas of clarification include Timeline, Lockup countdown, and Testnet user allocations. TimelinePrevious announcements indicated that EIGEN will be unlockable after new features go live. However, the Eigen Foundation did not specify when the new features could possibly go live to enable EIGEN transferability. They have now picked a date and it’s September 30th, 2024.Lockup CountdownThe community has also requested detailed information concerning the fund’s lockup and how EigenLayer will handle it. As earlier communicated, the funds on the protocol will be locked up for a while. Eigen Foundation clarifies that both Investors and team funds will remain locked up for one year after EIGEN becomes transferable. Giving users transfer powers way earlier than the team. The team will unlock at 4% per month, a year after and will be fully unlocked in three years. Testnet UsersThe developer community also received complaints from testnet users, claiming they were incorrectly removed from the eligibility list. Eigen Foundation has since clarified that the updates will be made and formal communication on the issue will be provided in due course.

Crypto exchanges to meet Nigerian SEC chief for regulatory talks

The Blockchain Industry Coordinating Committee of Nigeria (BICCoN) is convening a roundtable on May 6 between the new Director General of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and local and international crypto exchanges in Nigeria to discuss and seek consensus on the country’s crypto status.The BICCoN chair, Lucky Uwakwe, explained on a call with Cointelegraph that the meeting is open to all digital assets exchange operators, wallet providers, other virtual asset service providers (VASPs), and relevant industry associations and bodies to address pertinent issues and chart a progressive course for crypto regulations in Nigeria.Uwakwe explained that the virtual meeting is being convened at the invitation of Dr. Emomotimi Agama, the new DG of SEC Nigeria. Agama aims to engage with key stakeholders in the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem to address regulatory challenges and opportunities through collaborative dialogue. Agama, who was recently appointed to head the regulatory body, is known for his wealth of experience in blockchain and the capital market.According to Uwakwe, the meeting will allow different industry associations to present their perspectives on the current state of crypto in Nigeria. Some of these associations include Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG), Cryptographic Development Initiative in Nigeria (CDIN), Digital Currency Consortium (DCC) and Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SiBAN)Uwakwe expressed hope that the meeting could spark the right kind of change that would favor all crypto stakeholders in Nigeria and on the international scene. Uwakwe said:“Everyone’s presence and insights are invaluable as we collectively navigate the regulatory terrain and strive toward fostering an environment conducive to innovation and growth within the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector.”Nigeria has taken steps contradicting its December 2023 stance of lifting the crypto ban and has since launched probes into the use of cryptocurrency in the country. Related: Nigerian fintechs crack down on crypto, users face account blocksIn February, the Nigerian government used the country’s telecommunication providers to prevent local crypto users from accessing the websites of various crypto exchanges, such as Binance, OctaFX and others.Nigeria’s SEC also proposed an amendment to the rules guiding platforms offering crypto services, suggesting a hike in the registration fee for crypto exchanges from 30 million naira — the nation’s fiat currency — ($18,620) to 150 million naira ($93,000).Although the SEC attributes the proposed changes to input from industry stakeholders, some have criticized the 500 million naira ($310,343) paid-up capital requirement. They argue that this high fee would primarily favor foreign firms and disadvantage local entities.Magazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime

Pantera Capital invests in TON, eyes support for crypto adoption via Telegram - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Pantera Capital has announced it invested an undisclosed amount in TON.
The venture capital firm says TON’s integration with messaging platform Telegram could be a game-changer in crypto adoption.

Venture capital firm Pantera Capital has invested in The Open Network (TON) blockchain, the layer-1 network powered by Toncoin (TON).
TON was originally launched by messaging app giant Telegram and currently run by the open-source community.
In details shared in an announcement on Thursday, Pantera Capital said its investment aims at bolstering future growth for TON amid the push to bring more people to crypto via Telegram. 
Telegram integration boosts TON’s potential
The VC platform’s confidence in TON’s future and capacity to drive crypto adoption is down to the extensive use of crypto in the Telegram network.
“By leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and seamless UX with the vibrancy of TON’s emerging ecosystem, we believe TON has the potential to become one of the largest crypto networks,” Pantera wrote in the blog post.
While Pantera did not disclose the amount involved in the investment, it says Telegram, which has more than 900 million monthly active users, is the only major messaging app that is well poised to integrate Web3. 
As an illustration, the company cites Telegram’s monthly downloads of over 36.7 million in January this year as being ten times higher that of rival Signal.
“We believe Telegram is well positioned to bring crypto to the world because of its shared Web3 ethos and large distribution,” the company noted.
This outlook is strengthened by TON’s architecture, which features multiple components – TON Blockchain, TON Storage, TON DNS and TON Services. TON Blockchain serves as the backbone of this ecosystem, providing for a network with high transaction throughput, scalability and utility for millions of users.
Toncoin (TON) surges 
Pantera is investing in TON at a time the crypto platform is garnering massive interest from across the ecosystem.
Telegram has driven some of the biggest developments for TON, particularly its endorsement of the project. The decision to incorporate Toncoin (TON) token in a revenue-sharing program for channel owners. Telegram is also bringing tokenized emojis and stickers to its users via the TON blockchain.
Meanwhile, Tether’s integration and launch of native USDT on TON is another huge step for Telegram users.
TON price soared after the Pantera Capital news, with the altcoin jumping more than 12% to highs of $5.39 early Friday.

Dormant Ethereum holder moves $5.8M in ETH - More profit-taking now? - AMBCrypto



Stash was received during ETH’s ICO at 31 cents per token
Investor would lock a humongous 950719% in profits if they decide to sell

In what was a development that caught the eye of the broader cryptocurrency market, an Ethereum [ETH] holder woke up after nearly 9 years of dormancy to transfer their entire holdings to another wallet on Thursday.
Old ETH on the move
According to on-chain data tracking platform Lookonchain, an early investor who received 1,969 ETH during Ethereum’s initial coin offering (ICO) was seen moving 1,960 ETH. The transferred supply was worth $5.8 million at prevailing market prices. The participant received the ETH at 31 cents per token as part of the ICO.
The purpose of the transfer was yet to be ascertained, at the time of writing. However, there could be several explanations behind the move, with the most dominant narrative being realization of profits. At current prices, the investor would lock a humongous 950719% in profits.
Other factors could be diversifying their portfolios for other tokens.
Not the first time
Similar instances of reactivation of old ETH received during Genesis were seen earlier in the year. On 24 March, for instance, a participant moved the entirety of their 2,000 ETH received during the ICO. Before that, a wallet transferred 1,732 ETH to crypto-exchange Kraken on 2o February.
AMBCrypto investigated further using Santiment data and spotted sharp spikes in the movement of ETH that were inactive for more than five years. In nearly all the instances, the movement of dormant coins was followed by a price drop. This finding lends weight to the profit-taking theory discussed earlier.

ZKSNACKS Coinjoin Coordination Service Will Stop Functioning From June 1


							

ZKSNACKS has announced it is shutting down its Coinjoin coordination service from June 1, 2024.



The company cited regulatory uncertainty as the main reason for its decision.



Wasabi Wallet will continue functioning as a regular Bitcoin wallet.




ZKSNACKS, the company pioneering the development of the Wasabi wallet, has announced it is shutting down its Coinjoin coordination service from June 1, 2024. In a recent report, the company cited regulatory uncertainty as the main reason for discontinuing the privacy-focused service.







Posting on the Wasabi wallet blog, zkSNACKs highlighted that it decided to shut down the Coinjoin service following thoughtful considerations. However, the company noted that it will continue functioning as a regular Bitcoin wallet where users can generate private keys to receive and send Bitcoins.



Meanwhile, the firm highlighted Wasabi Wallet’s inherent privacy capabilities based on a filtering architecture on its client side, Tor integration, and custom coin selection functionalities. However, zkSNACKs highlighted the Bitcoin blockchain’s nature that prevents users from obtaining complete privacy without Coinjoins.



Furthermore, zkSNACKs noted that discontinuing its Coinjoin services would affect users of wallet clients that connect to the zkSNACKs coordinator, including Trezor Suite and BTCPayServer.









Wasabi Wallet is a pioneer privacy solution on the Bitcoin network that launched in 2018 as a free open-source software, and zkSNACKs noted it would maintain the protocol despite discontinuing Coinjoin. As an open-source solution, users can contribute, open new issues, submit pull requests, or even fork the Wasabi Wallet.



The decision to discontinue the Coinjoin privacy solution comes amid ongoing litigation between the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the foremost cryptocurrency privacy solution, Tornado Cash. In a recent twist of events, the DOJ filed an opposition to Tornado Cash’s co-founder’s motion asking the court to dismiss the money laundering, sanctions violations, and other charges labeled against him.

BNP Paribas buys shares of BlackRock's Bitcoin spot ETF

BNP Paribas, the second largest bank in Europe in terms of assets under management, has announced its investment in Bitcoin using BlackRock’s spot ETF tool.
The exposure of the credit institution on cryptocurrency has been revealed through form 13F, a quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that shows all the company’s managed activities.
Although the investment in IBIT may seem modest compared to the economic possibilities of the banking giant, its entry into the world of Bitcoin ETFs marks an important step towards achieving mainstream acceptance of this asset class.
Let’s see all the details below.

French bank BNP Paribas has purchased BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF: details from form 13F
According to the information from the 13F form filed on April 31, 2024 with the SEC, the bank BNP Paribas would have purchased shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) for $41,600.
Despite the figure being quite small, especially if we consider the second largest banking group in Europe with an AUM of 600 billion dollars, its entry sets an important precedent for other credit institutions that may intend to expose themselves to Bitcoin.
Going into more detail, based on what is reported in model 13F, which we remind you is mandatory for managers with institutional investments above 100 million dollars, BNP Paribas would have purchased 1,030 shares of IBIT in the first quarter of 2024 at $40.47 per share, for a total of $41,684.10, less than the value of a single Bitcoin at current prices.

Other banking giants and asset managers have entered the doors of the cryptographic market with Bitcoin spot ETFs. Among these are the best known Park Avenue Securities, Inscription Capital, Wedbush Private Capital and American National Bank.
Anyway BNP Paribas enjoys a much greater reputation being classified as one of the 6 most financially solid banks in the world by the rating agency Standard & Poor’s. 
The news of its exposure, although relatively small, could push the entire European banking sector to consider the possibility of a strategic investment aimed at increasing the performance of its portfolio.
In this regard, we report an analysis by Grayscale, which highlights how a 5% allocation to Bitcoin could maximize the returns (adjusted for risk) of a balanced portfolio, rather than focusing on bonds and stocks.
Since they were launched in January of this year, Bitcoin spot ETFs have already surpassed $200 billion in cumulative volume, marking an important milestone for the digital finance sector.
It seems that in addition to retail investors, institutional investors are also attracted to this instrument: we will see in the future which will be the next giants to join the ranks of bitcoiners.
Meanwhile, some insights from BlackRock suggest that investments in ETFs are set to expand, with potential imminent allocations from sovereign funds, pensions, and endowments.
Netflow trend of its Bitcoin ETF: 7 consecutive days in the red
While BNP Paribas begins to acquire IBIT shares of BlackRock, the net flows of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States mark negative values day after day, fueling the drop in the price of the cryptocurrency.
According to data from Farside Investors, from April 24th to May 2nd, each trading session on these products ended with more outflow than inflow.
Grayscale still dominates the stage in terms of sales, representing the largest ETF, with an AUM of 17.2 billion dollars.
Blackrock instead, which follows in second place the rival with an AUM of 16.4 billion dollars, has recorded an anomalous trend having marked 0 trades from April 24th to 30th, and a netflow of 36.9 million on May 1st, then returning to 0 the following day.
The situation at the moment seems to be in the hands of sellers, effectively influencing the price action of BTC pushing it towards 52,000 USD.
The short-term future of cryptocurrency, in addition to the internal scenarios of spot ETFs, is also and above all marked by the performance of the global economy at a macro level.
The next interventions of the FED will be crucial in determining the economic policies of the American central bank, and consequently the influence on risk-on assets such as Bitcoin.
Probably the hot season for investments will arrive in the middle of summer or around September/October, as soon as the first interest rate cut is made as a sign of tightening easing. 
Meanwhile, Bitcoin spot ETFs, regardless of the market direction, attract very significant trading volumes, totaling over $200 billion.
Since the beginning of the year, the netflow is positive for 11.1 billion dollars, despite the outflow of 17.5 billion from Grayscale.

Dutch Authority Seizes $12 Million in ZKasino Rug Pull Case


In a notable crackdown on crypto fraud, the Dutch anti-fraud agency FIOD has arrested a 26-year-old man. 
He is suspected of fraud, embezzlement, and money laundering concerning the ZKasino rug pull, marking a critical development in combating crypto-related scams.
Dutch Agency Investigates ZKasino Rug Pull 
FIOD initiated a rigorous investigation on April 25, spurred by alerts from X (formerly Twitter) and intelligence from their departments. The focus was a significant rug pull involving the gambling platform ZKasino, where over $32 million was invested by global victims. 

“Investors were led to believe that they would get their investments back within 30 days. That did not happen. The smart contract was set up in such a technical way that suggests that this return was not intended,” FIOD wrote.

During the operation, authorities searched a residence and seized various digital data carriers. Assets confiscated included over €11.4 million (~ $12.2 million) in real estate, a luxury car, and diverse cryptocurrencies. 
The agency presented the suspect before a magistrate. Consequently, they managed to extend the suspect’s detention by fourteen days to allow further investigation.
Moreover, FIOD worked closely with Binance’s Financial Crime Compliance and Investigations Team to secure millions in cryptocurrencies. This collaboration highlights the growing synergy between law enforcement and cryptocurrency platforms in addressing financial crimes.
Additionally, FIOD believes there are probabilities for more arrests, as investigation evolves.

The allegations against ZKasino have drawn severe criticism from industry experts, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He criticized the platform for its fraudulent misuse of zero-knowledge proofs, stressing that emerging technologies are increasingly becoming buzzwords exploited by scammers. 

“There is nothing “ZK” about ZKasino except that it lives on zksync, correct? I guess we have to adapt; even “ZK” is now a mainstream enough buzzword that full-on scammers are adopting it,” Buterin remarked.

Additionally, ZKasino faced serious accusations from ZigZag Exchange last month, which charged its developers with diverting development funds for personal use. Although these claims initially attracted little attention, the escalating complaints from the crypto community brought the issues to prominence. 
ZigZag also alleged that ZKasino made false claims about its funding and failed to compensate many developers and contractors.

In response to the unfolding controversy, significant players in the cryptocurrency market took decisive action. Notably, the MEXC exchange canceled its planned token listing for ZKasino to protect its users’ rights, while Ape Terminal canceled its Initial DEX Offering linked to ZKasino, assuring refunds to all participants.

Dogecoin Mirroring Price Action That Preceded Massive Bull Runs in the Past, Says Trader - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Ali Martinez is saying that the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) is exhibiting behavior it has previously displayed before embarking on massive rallies.
Martinez tells his 61,200 followers on the social media platform X that the largest memecoin by market cap earlier this year broke out of a descending triangle, which is considered bullish if the price breaks out above the upper trend line, on the weekly chart.










“It is currently undergoing a 47% price correction, very similar to previous cycles, which could ignite the next DOGE bull run!”

All Bitcoin ETFs Are Dropping Their Holdings

Recently, nine Bitcoin ETFs significantly reduced their holdings by a total of 8,107 BTC, worth approximately $478.22 million. This reduction included notable entities such as BlackRock, which reduced its holdings by 638 BTC (about $37.62 million). Similarly, Fidelity and Grayscale reduced their holdings by 3,323 BTC (around $196 million) and 1,588 BTC (approximately $93.66 million), respectively.This substantial decrease in Bitcoin holdings by ETFs coincides with the cryptocurrency's price drop below the $60,000 mark, a critical support level that had previously been considered a strong threshold that held the market together. This price decline has led to significant outflows, indicating a shift in investor sentiment toward caution due to increased market volatility and potential risk aversion.BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewFrom the recent chart analysis, Bitcoin shows that it struggled to maintain levels above $60,000 and faced resistance near $61,018. Following the drop, the price found temporary footing around $52,107, suggesting a possible new lower boundary of support. Currently, Bitcoin is trading slightly above $59,375, trying to recover from recent falls but still below the critical resistance level.For Bitcoin's price to exhibit growth and regain confidence among investors, it would need to consistently hold above the $52,107 (200 EMA) support level and ideally break through the resistance at $61,018. This movement would likely require positive sentiment across the market, possibly driven by rising demand for risky assets.Looking ahead, the key for Bitcoin will be its ability to stabilize and attract investors back to a bullish stance. If it successfully maintains above the mentioned support and breaks past the resistance, it could signal a turnaround to a bullish market. However, failure to do so might see the price testing even lower support levels, possibly around $50,000.

First Option Data of May Announced! Has the Expected Rise Signal Arrived for Bitcoin and Etherem? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Bitcoin fell below $60,000 in the declines that started in April. While the BTC price dropped to $56,000, it later recovered and approached $60,000.
Now, while a rise is expected in BTC and altcoins, eyes are turned to Bitcoin and Ethereum options that will expire today.


According to the news of Singapore-based crypto options data platform Greeks.live, 23,000 BTC and 330,000 ETH options will expire on May 3.
Accordingly, while the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.49, the maximum loss point is $61,000 and the notional value is $1.4 billion.





Looking at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.36, a maximum loss point of $3,000, and a notional value of $1 billion.
Stating that Bitcoin continued to fall after its ATH in March, Greeks.live said that the failure of Hong Kong ETFs to meet expectations and the continuation of outflows in spot ETFs in the USA were effective in this decline.



“The crypto market continued to decline this week, with BTC falling to a new low since March.
This decline was due to the failure of Hong Kong ETFs to achieve the expected volume increase and the continuation of outflows in US BTC ETFs. These led to a weakening of market confidence.
However, sustained horizontal movements are unlikely to last long. And without the necessary catalysts for recovery, a downward slide is inevitable.”

What Does the Put/Call Ratio Indicate for Bitcoin and Ethereum?
The put/call ratio is calculated by dividing the number of put options by the number of call options. A ratio below 1 means there are more purchases than puts, indicating an upward trend.
A ratio above 1 means there are more put options than call options, indicating a bearish trend. A ratio close to 1 means the market is balanced or neutral.





For Bitcoin, this rate is 0.49; For Ethereum it appears as 0.36. Accordingly, although these rates indicate an upward trend for BTC and ETH, they alone will not be sufficient data for an increase or decrease.
Time will tell how these rates, along with other data and signals, will affect prices. At this point, do not make your investment decisions based on a single data or report.

Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) Forming Dead Cat Bounce? Questionable Reversal

Shiba Inu is currently exhibiting signs of a weak reversal, also known as a dead cat bounce. Unfortunately, as things unfold, there is a good possibility of Shiba Inu simply losing steam and reversing downwards. One way or another, the market's state, in general, will be a decisive factor here. In recent trading sessions, SHIB has shown some upward momentum from its lows, but this trend lacks the strength we saw in previous strong rallies. The volume accompanying these price changes has been notably low, indicating a lack of substantial buying interest. This scenario is often a red flag suggesting that the asset does not have enough backing at this point in time. SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewExamining the chart, SHIB is trading near the $0.00002264 mark, struggling to break past the immediate resistance level at $0.00002384. This resistance level is crucial as it previously acted as both support and resistance, making it a significant price point for the asset. If SHIB manages to sustain a breakout above this level, it might target the next resistance near $0.00002447.However, the potential for a further decline cannot be ignored. SHIB is showing signs that the lows around $0.00002175 might not hold if selling pressure increases. Such a breakdown could see SHIB testing even lower supports, potentially around $0.00002000, a level crucial for the Shbia Inu's foreseeable future. The broader sentiment around Shiba Inu mirrors the general risk currently prevalent on the market. Investors are cautious, steering away from assets considered risky, especially meme coins like SHIB. The overall market demand for such assets is close to nonexistent.

Bitcoin miner CleanSpark records highest single mining day in April in post-halving report

CleanSpark has released its first monthly unaudited Bitcoin mining and operations update since the halving. The company exceeded 17 EH/s in hashrate, mining an impressive 721 BTC with a record daily high of over 48 BTC.CEO Zach Bradford highlighted the company’s monthly gains in efficiency metrics as they deploy advanced S21 machines across their expanding facilities. These improvements have amplified mining output and optimized operational costs. He commented,“The remarkable increase in transaction fees immediately following the halving has significantly bolstered our bitcoin production this month, resulting in a robust increase to our bitcoin treasury.”Bradford emphasized CleanSpark’s industry-leading scale and low mining costs, positioning them to excel in the new post-halving environment. The company has already observed signs of less efficient miners ceasing operations, which is expected to contribute to a decline in the global hash rate and a temporary yet beneficial correction in Bitcoin’s spot price over the coming weeks.In April 2024, CleanSpark mined 721 BTC, bringing their year-to-date total to 2,752 BTC. As of April 30, the company held 5,739 BTC in its treasury. CleanSpark sold 2.88 bitcoin in April at an average price of approximately $64,000 per Bitcoin. Their deployed fleet consisted of 136,496 miners with a month-end fleet efficiency of 24.22 J/TH and a current hashrate of 17.3 EH/s.The company is making progress on expanding its Dalton, GA, campus. Once complete, the expansion, referred to as Dalton 4, will run a fleet of S21s in a 15MW facility, adding approximately 0.8 EH/s. This will bring CleanSpark’s total hashrate at the Dalton campus, consisting of four independent data centers, to 2.4 EH/s.CleanSpark’s strong performance in April demonstrates its ability to thrive in the competitive post-halving Bitcoin mining landscape. With its focus on efficiency, expanding operations, and strategic planning, the company believes it is well-positioned for continued success in the months and years ahead.Mentioned in this article

Solana vs Polygon and TRON - What DEX volumes and TVLs tell us - AMBCrypto



Solana outperformed Polygon and Tron in terms of transaction volume
DEX volumes and TVL surged, while overall interest in Solana NFTs waned

Recently activity and interest on the Solana [SOL] network dipped. Despite the slowdown in activity, however, it still managed to outperform networks such as Polygon and Tron.
In fact, Artemis’s data revealed that Solana continued to dominate in terms of transfer volume and came second only to Ethereum on this front.
Source: Artemis
DEX volumes on the rise
However, it wasn’t just overall activity where Solana prospered, with recent data indicating that Solana did well in terms of DEX (Decentralized Exchange) volumes too. Over the last few days alone, Solana’s DEX volumes grew from $691 million to $1.2 billion. This surge in DEX volumes highlighted the popularity of Solana’s DEXs, indicative of a budding ecosystem.
The activity on the DEXs on Solana can be largely attributed to the popularity of memecoins on the Solana network. The low fees required to build tokens on the Solana network caused a surge in the creation and trading of memecoins, leading to the DEX volumes growing.
Source: Artemis
Owing to these factors, Solana did relatively well in terms of TVL (Total Value Locked) as well. In fact, Solana managed to have an average TVL of $3.7 billion over the last few days.
Here, it’s worth noting that even though Solana’s TVL was consistent, protocols such as Tron continued to outperform Solana on this front.
Source: Artemis
Despite Solana’s consistent activity and TVL, however, the revenue generated on the network continued to decline.
In fact, over the past week, the revenue generated by Solana fell from $1.1 million to $381,000. Tron took the lead in this department as well and continued to generate high amounts of revenue.
Even though the overall metrics of the Solana ecosystem have been showing signs of a healthy network, areas such as TVL and revenue would need to improve for long-term sustainability.

Read Solana’s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-25

NFT interest falls
Another area where Solana would need to see improvement would be in the NFT sector. Over the last few weeks, interest in blue chip NFT collections has plummeted.
Coupled with that, the total floor value of the average Solana NFT collection and NFT sales volumes have also declined.

FTX Ex-Executive Ryan Salame surrenders $5.9M estate in Bahamas

Ryan Salame, the former co-head at FTX Digital Markets, has agreed to surrender a million-dollar estate in the Bahamas. This decision is a concession he made as part of the plea bargain with American authorities. An object in question we are holding, valued at $5.9 million, is situated in the Marina Residences at Albany Building 10 Condominium, Unit 3A in particular. Alipay Salame’s agreement for the transfer is meant to be an important part of restitution for $5.6 million for FTX Trading Ltd and related creditors.The process of asset transfer was stated in the motion filed on May 1, 2023, with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The filings stated that instead of selling the property, the debtors prefer to pursue a deed in lieu of foreclosure in order to sidestep the possible losses from a quick sale. This strategy aims to keep the value of their other Bahamian real estate properties and then monetize them in the future.Salame made a strategic choice to utilize the land to pay the restitution that was accepted to avoid the financial hardships of a cash payment. The agreement is viewed as satisfactory for both parties, Salame and the debtors, enabling the former to pay the full penalty and avoid asset forfeiture.FTX bankruptcy unravels complex property dealsIn September 2021, Salame purchased the property from the Alameda Research account at Silvergate Bank, where he sent a 10% deposit ($7.2 million). Consequently, the next installments for the same property were paid to Salame through the FTX DM correspondent account in the total sum of $8.1 million, transferred from the Fidelity Bank account in the Bahamas. Such funds were meant to be attached to the balance of the purchase payment.On March 31, 2022, Salame and Alameda Research signed a promissory note to confirm the terms of payment between Salame and Alameda. According to the note, Salame would pay Alameda $8.1 million back. Besides that development, the company was compelled to disclose its financial arrangement due to the broader unraveling of FTX and Alameda, which led to bankruptcy filings in November 2022. Real estate transactions are also among the things that have been unwound in the current bankruptcy flow of files.The transfer of the property to finalize the restitution is indispensable to settle the rift through which the funds of previous FTX Digital Markets tenures were lost. This is a measure towards wider initiatives to deal with the negative impact following the company’s demise.Ryan Salame pleads guilty, awaits sentencingRyan Salame was charged with conspiracy to make illegal political contributions, defraud the Federal Election Commission, and run an unregistered money transmission company. His guilty plea last September resulted in the present restitution agreement. Salame will be sentenced on May 28, 2024, though the criminal proceedings may not end on the same date.The case has raised the question of regulation and law in the cryptocurrency industry. Alongside FTX, ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who was accused of the crime, was also given 25 years in prison in March last year. The resolution of Salame’s case, comprising the transfer of property, is being continuously reviewed to understand the circumvention of comprehensive financial crimes involving cryptocurrency organizations. The implications may also possibly set a precedent for future regulatory mechanisms that cater to cryptocurrency markets and prevent the recurrence of similar situations.

Australia Clarifies Crypto Use in Non-Cash Payment Facilities - DailyCoin


        
Australia has set a precedent for crypto in non-cash payments.



The precedent emanated from a ruling in ASIC’s case against BPS.



The case is still ongoing.
Justice Downes of Australia’s Federal Court has set a judicial precedent clarifying the legality of non-cash payment facilities involving cryptocurrency assets.On May 3, the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) announced its first court win against BPS Financial Pty (BPS), a company the regulator accused of advertising Qoin tokens as a mode of payment via Qoin Wallet for goods and services offered by Qoin Merchants.In delivering judgment, the court highlighted the legal shortcomings of BPS’s crypto-based, non-cash payment product.When Crypto Is Illegal in Non-Cash PaymentsAccording to the announcement, Justice Downes found that BPS’s offering contravened Australia’s Corporations Act as the company did not hold an Australian Financial Services License, “nor was authorized by a licensed holder to provide financial advice about the Qoin Wallet.”
Pointing out deceptive promotion, the court noted that BPS misrepresented that the Qoin wallet was officially registered when it was not and that it could be used to acquire goods and services from an “increasing number of Qoin merchants,” when in fact “it was declining.”The court further established that BPS misled its customers that they could exchange Qoin tokens for fiat or other cryptocurrencies through independent exchanges.
“The Court found the only digital currency exchange that accepted Qoin prior to November 2021 was BTX Exchange, which was not independent of BPS and did not permit crypto assets to be exchanged with each other,” ASIC stated.Per ASIC Chair Joe Longo, the ruling has set a significant precedent in Australia’s crypto industry by clarifying what a regulated product constituted and when the underlying provider needed a license.Following the first outcome, the court directed ASIC and BPS to “confer with respect to directions” that may be made for further hearings.Read about Australia’s plans for a Bitcoin ETF:Australia Mulls Bitcoin ETF to Bolster Crypto Hub AmbitionsStay updated on BTCC’s massive crypto trading contest:BTCC Sets 10M USDT Rewards for Its World Trading Contest

                        The Jupiter price has risen by 8% in the past 24 hours, with its move to $1.01 coming as the wider crypto market gains by a more modest 2.5% today.This means that JUP is basically flat in a week, but down by 3% in a fortnight and by 40% in a month.The DeFi utility token is also down by 49% since reaching an all-time high of $2 on January 31 of this year.However, this slippage arguably means that the coin is ready to rebound in a big way, with today’s jump potentially the beginning of a significant rally.Jupiter Price Prediction as JUP Gains 8% Overnight — Is It Time to Load Up?
What’s interesting about JUP’s chart is that the coin had been in a weak position in recent days and weeks, but its indicators now suggest that it’s making a return.This is particularly noticeable with the coin’s 30-day average (orange), which is on the brink of overtaking its 200-day (blue), a move which typically indicates a breakout.Source: TradingViewAt the same time, JUP’s relative strength index (purple) has finally risen above 60 today.While it has dipped in the past few hours it’s likely to rebound soon, given that it had already spent so long below 50 over the past week.It’s also encouraging that the coin’s trading volume has risen from $70 million a few days ago to $140 million today.This indicates rising interest in the token, and because volumes had been low for several weeks, it’s possible that today is the beginning of a sustained increase.One of the fundamental reasons for JUP’s gains over the past couple of days is that Jupiter recently announced the launch of a new liquid staking token, JupSOL.The high yields offered by this token have driven investors to Jupiter, with the latest data now showing that the latter is the biggest DEX in the market in terms of unique active wallets.Such growth is likely to push the Jupiter price higher in the medium- and long-term, especially as and when rate cuts arrive and help the wider market rally.JUP could possibly hit $1.30 by the end of the summer, before returning to its ATH by the end of 2024.Diversification into Low-Cap Alts for Big Gains
While JUP is an exciting prospect right now, it isn’t the only alt in the market with strong potential for big gains in the near and more distant future.We’re also seeing a wide variety of presale tokens that have been raising large sums on the basis of having solid fundamentals and communities.And one of the hottest at the moment is Sealana (SEAL), a Solana-based meme coin which launched its token offering only this week.It has already raised just over $140,000, with this total only likely to accelerate as word spreads about the project.Source: sealana.ioSealana has chosen the seal as its meme, albeit an anthropomorphic seal that likes to trade crypto and make enough money to not have to work.It already seems that its stylings are attracting investors, with SEAL on course to become the latest Solana meme token to outperform much of the market.While additional details about the project will emerge in due course, traders can already join its presale by going to the official Sealana website.There, they can send SOL to the following address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.They can currently buy Sealana at an exchange rate of 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which converts to around $0.02 at today’s prices. Given what we’ve seen from other Solana-based meme tokens this year (e.g. WIF), SEAL could surge well beyond this price once it lists in the next few weeks.Buyers will receive their tokens via an airdrop, once the sale ends, at which point they will be able to sell (or hold) and make some potentially large profits.Buy SEAL Today

Nigerian BICCoN calls for crypto exchanges round table with SEC chief amid crackdown - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Recently, crypto exchanges like Binance have found themselves under serious scrutiny in Nigeria
The BICCoN-led initiative for a meeting between the SEC chief and crypto exchanges reflects a commitment to fostering a conducive crypto environment.
The outcome of the discussions holds the potential to shape the future trajectory of crypto regulation in Nigeria.

Nigeria’s cryptocurrency landscape is witnessing a flurry of activity as regulatory discussions heat up. Amidst crackdowns by the Nigerian Central Bank (CBN) on crypto transactions, the Blockchain Industry Coordinating Committee of Nigeria (BICCoN) has called for a pivotal meeting between the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) chief and local and international crypto exchanges.
Regulatory dialogue fuels hope for crypto exchanges
Despite efforts to promote regulatory clarity, Nigeria’s crypto space faces contradictions and challenges amid recent actions by the Nigerian Central Bank including crackdowns on crypto transactions and probes into cryptocurrency usage. Moreover, telecommunications providers have been compelled to block local crypto users from accessing various crypto exchanges’ websites.
Also, in 2022, the SEC introduced new crypto rules, including a substantial hike in registration fees for crypto exchanges, sparking criticism, particularly due to the potential disadvantage to local entities.
The meeting, slated for May 6, aims to address the regulatory challenges and seek consensus on the country’s crypto status. It signals a potential turning point in Nigeria’s crypto regulatory landscape after a period of intense crackdown on cryptocurrency activities in the country.
Dr. Emomotimi Agama, the newly appointed SEC Director General, has extended invitations to industry players, including Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG), Cryptographic Development Initiative in Nigeria (CDIN), Digital Currency Consortium (DCC), and Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SiBAN).
If fruitful the meeting will foster collaborative efforts in navigating regulatory challenges and unlocking opportunities for growth within Nigeria’s crypto ecosystem.
With diverse perspectives being brought to the table, there is optimism that the meeting could spark positive changes benefiting all crypto stakeholders in Nigeria and on the international stage.

                        The Bonk ($BONK) meme coin is one of today’s biggest rallies, with the BONK price skyrocketing 13.4% in 24 hours.The Solamna meme coin currently trades for $0.00002611. Its overnight gains are the highest of any top 100 currency, except Arweave (AR) which blew up 19.5% to trade at $34.98.That also makes it the fastest appreciating meme coin among the seven largest by market capitalization. Sector leader Dogecoin ($DOGE) only added 3.4% overnight and trades at $0.1327 at the start of the weekend. BONK’s trading chart shows an asset that rose in step with the rest of the market during the early March rally. However, where Bitcoin peaked in the middle of the month, BONK peaked very early on; on March 4 it posted a new all-time high of $0.00004547, though it has since fallen back by 42.5%. Source: TradingViewBONK is currently trading slightly against the grain of the rest of the market. The token’s price is currently valued higher than its 30-day moving average, as seen in the respective green and blue lines. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 67 and climbing, investors appear to be pumping the token, however this momentum is likely to die down quickly.Bonk Bounces Back Faster Than Bitcoin
Market leaders Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH) had more muted recoveries. The world’s favorite cryptocurrency added 2.5% to trade at $59,305 on Friday morning, UTC. Its number one contender added 1.3% and sells at $2,976 as of this writing. Markets were rocked on Tuesday by news that Binance’s founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao received a four-month prison sentence for charges related to money laundering. Prosecutors argued that Binance’s previously lax approach to KYC and AML enabled multiple criminal actors to launder money through the exchange.Wednesday threw up another reason for investors to become risk-averse.

Jack Dorsey's Company, Block, Announced Which Cryptocurrency It Will Buy With Its Profits! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Jack Dorsey's company Block, formerly known as Square, saw its shares rise in after-hours trading Thursday after a first-quarter earnings report that beat analysts' expectations.
Block's Bitcoin Investment Strategy Boosts Shares
The company reported adjusted earnings of 85 cents per share, beating the consensus estimate by 13 cents and generating revenue of $5.97 billion, topping Wall Street's projection of $5.82 billion. Gross profit in this quarter increased by 22% compared to the previous year, reaching $2.09 billion.


In a notable move, the Jack Dorsey-led company announced plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings and open source its treasury blueprint to encourage others to do the same.

Block will invest 10% of the gross profit it makes from Bitcoin products into Bitcoin purchases each month. The company's original Bitcoin investment of $220 million has already increased by nearly 160% to $573 million.


“We believe the world needs an open monetary protocol that is not owned or controlled by any single entity,” Dorsey said.





“We believe Bitcoin is the best and only candidate to be this protocol and ultimately the native currency of the internet.”
The company's Cash App unit recorded a 25% increase in gross profit in the first quarter compared to the same period a year ago.


This growth was primarily driven by strong performance in Cash App Card, BNPL platform, Bitcoin products and Cash App Borrow, as well as inflows and monetization rate per asset.
While the total amount of Bitcoin sales sold to customers and recorded as Bitcoin revenue was $2.73 billion, a gross profit of $80 million was achieved in the first quarter.

Dutch police arrest suspect in $30 million ZKasino scam - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Dutch police arrested a 26-year-old man on April 29.
The arrest is connected to the ZKasino crypto gambling scam that involves over $30 million.
Police have seized 11.4 million euros ($12.2 million) in crypto and other assets from the suspect.

Dutch police have arrested a 26-year-old man amid a law enforcement investigation around ZKasino. The crypto project is allegedly a crypto gambling scam involving more than $30 million.
ZKasino scam suspect arrested
According to the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD), authorities detained the individual on April 29, on suspicion of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering. The arrest comes after an outcry from the public in the wake of suspicious activities around the ZKasino platform.
Dutch authorities have seized more than 11.4 million euros ($12.2 million) in crypto assets, real estate and a luxury car from the suspect, FIOD announced on May 3.
Scrutiny on ZKasino increased in mid-April after multiple crypto exchanges and platforms, including Ape Terminal, halted listing of the project’s token amid scam allegations.
FIOD says a criminal investigation into ZKasino launched on April 25. 
The probe into the crypto gambling platform revolves around a potential rug pull, with over $30 million invested by people from across the world. Investors were led to believe they would receive returns on their money within 30 days.
Zkasino raised 10,515 ETH from investors in March. Ahead of its launch, ZKasino attracted over 10,000 participants to its $ZKAS token bridge. 
However, red flags hit when the team moved all of the ETH to a Lido staking account and changed wording content on its website. Despite widespread condemnation, with security analysts pointing to a potential rug pull, the ZKasino team called these FUD and alleged the project’s launch would go live.
According to FIOD, the suspect will be detained for fourteen days to allow for further investigations.

Bitcoin and Ether options worth $2.4B set to expire May 3, max BTC pain at $61K

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) options contracts worth a combined $2.4 billion are set to expire on May 3, which could lead to increased market volatility.A Bitcoin options contract is a derivative contract that allows investors to speculate on Bitcoin price movements without owning Bitcoin itself. There are two types: call and put options. Call options give investors the right to buy a cryptocurrency at a specific price before a certain date. Put options, on the other hand, allow investors to sell a cryptocurrency at a particular price before the expiry date.Investors often use the put/call ratio as a metric to assess the general state of the market. If traders are purchasing more puts than calls, it is considered a bearish sign, and if they are purchasing more calls than puts, then the market sentiment is considered bullish. A put-to-call ratio below 0.7 is considered bullish, while a ratio of more than 1 is regarded as a bearish indicator.Related: US lawmakers urge SEC to approve Bitcoin options tradingOn May 3, a total of 23,367 Bitcoin contracts worth $1.39 billion are set to expire. Data from the Deribit exchange reveal that the put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options contracts is currently at 0.5, with a maximum pain point of $61,000. The maximum pain point refers to the price at which the asset will cause financial losses to the greatest number of holders.Bitcoin options expiry.

Bitcoin and Ether have experienced bearish pressure in the past couple of weeks. The BTC price fell below $60,000, marking an almost 20% weekly correction post-halving. The Ether price also fell below $2,900.

DOJ Crackdown on Privacy App Sparks Debate on Digital Financial Privacy


							

DOJ crackdown on Wasabi Wallet’s coinjoin service raises digital privacy concerns.



Whistleblower Edward Snowden criticises slow progress on Bitcoin privacy by Developers.



Privacy advocates urge developers to find solutions for anonymous transactions.




DOJ’s Crackdown on Privacy App Wasabi Wallet Raises Concerns About Financial Privacy in Digital Age. Privacy-focused Wasabi wallet has shut down its Coinjoin Coordination service. Naomi Brockwell, a cryptocurrency and privacy advocate criticized the DOJ’s action on Twitter, stressing the importance of financial privacy for a free society.







zkSNACKs, the company behind the development of Wasabi Wallet tweeted that it is is discontinuing its conjoin coordination service effective June 1st, 2024, after years of dedicated work to enhance Bitcoin’s privacy. 



Privacy Advocate Edward Snowden who has always been a famous figure in the world of cryptocurrencies and privacy joined the conversation. Snowden used the Wasabi wallet discontinuation tweet as a reference to indicate Bitcoin Developers that the clock on Privacy is ticking as the DOJ is criminalising Privacy-focused developments in the industry.









Going back in the 2020 conversation, Snowden and Brockwell discussed the need for privacy in Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Snowden, a champion for privacy and freedoms, questioned the slow progress on issues like scaling and privacy within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. He pointed out the weaknesses in existing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, regarding privacy protections.



Brockwell’s tweet aligns with Snowden’s concerns, as the DOJ’s crackdown highlights the ongoing struggle to ensure financial privacy in the digital age. Snowden argues that developers have had ample time to address these issues but haven’t provided viable solutions, reflecting a broader sentiment within the cryptocurrency community.

Bitcoin Spot ETFs In Hong Kong Gains Attention: Bloomberg Analyst Weighs In | Bitcoinist.com


								Following a successful first-day trade of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in Hong Kong, popular Bloomberg Intelligence expert Eric Balchunas has taken center stage to analyze the historical introduction of the products in the country.
Hong Kong’s Bitcoin Spot ETFs Attract Notable Inflows
On Tuesday, Eric Balchunas called Hong Kong Spot Bitcoin ETFs a market for ants, as it is just 1/168th the size of the funds in the United States. He further highlighted that the debut of HK spot ETFs coincided well with the US slowdown, so their inflows will more than offset the marginally negative US flows.

Given the notable inflows seen on the first day, the Human and Machine channel called out the analyst noting that after raising more than HK$11.2 million on their first day of operation, Hong Kong’s Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs countered net outflows from the US market.
Responding to the channel’s post, Balchunas stated that he and his team recently released a memo including the final data regarding HK’s spot ETFs, which is not as timely as in the US. According to the expert, he previously projected the products would garner a $1 billion inflow in two years. However, with Hong Kong witnessing $292 million in assets on day 1, he believes his predictions might be way ahead of schedule and corrections can derail plans, as seen in the US market.
During the first day of trading, Ethereum spot ETFs took up 15% of the market, and investors seemed to be drawn to larger funds rather than lower fees. The ChinaAMC BTC spot ETF (3042 HK) with higher fees saw the highest inflow valued at $124 million on the first day. Meanwhile, other funds with lesser fees like the Harvest Bitcoin Spot ETF (3439 HK) and Bosera Hashkey Bitcoin ETF (3008 HK) saw a net inflow of $63 million and $61 million respectively on day one.
Eric Balchunas’s emphasis seemed to have fueled confusion among community members, as a pseudonymous X user questioned the analyst on the difference between the $292 million in assets and the HK$11.2 million of inflows. 
Balchunas responded saying that the exact $292 million in assets that were contributed as seed money just prior to launch are not included in the volume calculation. Meanwhile, in the US, seed money is withheld until the first day to make the volume appear larger, which aids in marketing.
The Funds Sees Massive Outflows In US
The Bloomberg expert’s review came in light of the massive outflows witnessed in the US market surpassing $500 million in a day. Wednesday saw the fastest-ever selloff of US BTC spot ETFs by investors, recording a cumulative net outflow of $563.7 million.

According to data from Farside Investors, this marks the biggest outflow since the funds started trading early this year. Of the 10 Spot Bitcoin ETFs, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw the largest withdrawals, totaling $191.1 million.
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) had withdrawals of about $167.4 million, while Blackrock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a whopping $36.9 million withdrawn, marking its first day of outflows since its inception.

3 May: 5 Solana Memecoins That Could Skyrocket 9,000% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

                        Coinbase has reported a remarkable revenue of $1.6 billion in the first quarter of the year, representing a substantial 72% increase compared to the previous quarter. The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States also disclosed a net income of $1.18 billion ($4.40 per share). The impressive performance was driven by a surge in transactions resulting from the overall uptrend in the cryptocurrency market and a favorable change in accounting rules related to cryptocurrencies.Coinbase Transaction Revenue Doubles
Consumer transaction revenue experienced a doubling effect, reaching $935.2 million, with volume soaring by over 93% to $56 billion. Institutional trading witnessed even more significant growth, with revenue surging by 133% to $85.4 million compared to the previous quarter, while volume more than doubled to $256 billion. Bitcoin played a prominent role in both consumer and institutional transactions, accounting for one-third of the activity.These figures, which surpassed analysts’ predictions of $1.34 billion in revenue and net income of $1.09 per share, greatly exceeded expectations. Following the announcement, Coinbase’s shares experienced a slight decline in after-hours trading, having initially risen nearly 9% to approximately $229 earlier in the day. It is worth noting that a year ago, the shares traded at a mere $51.It is worth noting that during the first quarter of the previous year, Coinbase reported losses of $78.9 million (or 34 cents per share).Moreover, Coinbase’s Q1 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) reached an impressive $1 billion, surpassing the total for the entire previous year. While the quarterly results were overall strong, the exceptional revenue figures were partly boosted by a one-time $737 million paper gain resulting from new accounting rules that allow crypto firms to record price increases in their balance sheets.US Market Share Increased
In a letter to shareholders accompanying the quarterly report, Coinbase highlighted the progress made towards its 2024 priorities of driving revenue, utility, and regulatory clarity.The company emphasized its increased market share in U.S. spot and derivatives, achieving all-time highs on Coinbase Prime, and witnessing a significant increase in USDC market capitalization.Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 chain, Base, launched in August, generated $56.1 million in revenue during the first quarter. Base outperformed Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, and developer activity on the network increased by an impressive 800%. Additionally, Coinbase acquired a minority stake in Circle, the issuer of stablecoin USDC, which experienced a 30% growth in market capitalization in Q1. As a result, Coinbase’s subscriptions and services revenue increased by one-third, including a 15% boost in stablecoin revenue.While Coinbase has diversified its revenue streams with Base and USDC, the recent gains were primarily driven by favorable market conditions. For example, during this quarter, the price of Bitcoin rose by 57% and reached an all-time high of $73,000 due to over $50 billion flowing into 10 spot exchange-traded funds approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 11.However, Coinbase’s transaction expenses also grew significantly, increasing by 73% to $217 million. Looking ahead to Q2, the company estimates its overall expenses to be as high as $890 million, primarily driven by the elevated costs associated with higher trading volumes, including customer support and infrastructure expenses.

Ripple sell-off alert: 200 million XRP reserved for May dumps


Ripple has reserved 200 million out of the 1 billion XRP unlocked in May for its monthly sell-off. This amount is worth nearly $104 million, with XRP price trading below $0.52.
Currently, the company has around 39.70 billion tokens locked in escrows from the initial distribution that never circulated. Ripple unlocks 1 billion of these XRP tokens every month and re-locks an arbitrary amount for further release.
Finbold has tracked these unlocks, identifying patterns that affect the asset’s long-term value and also XRP’s short-term price action.


Notably, Ripple used two new accounts for May’s unlock, starting a new escrow epoch with the ‘Ripple (24)‘ and ‘Ripple (25)‘ labeled accounts. Previously, the company was using ‘Ripple (22)’ and ‘Ripple (23)’, now with no escrows left, as reported on April 30.
Ripple XRP reserves and escrow activity in May
As developed, ‘Ripple (24)’ first sent the 200 million XRP for May’s sell-off to ‘Ripple (1)’. Later, the account sent 300 million tokens to ‘Ripple (13)’ and re-locked the amount for an escrow to September 2027.

Meanwhile, the ‘Ripple (25)’ account sent 500 million to ‘Ripple (12)’, which is also scheduled to finish in September 2027.
Monthly Ripple (XRP) unlock – May, 2024. Source: Finbold
XRP price analysis amid Ripple sell-offs
Interestingly, Ripple’s previous sell-offs and escrow activities coincide with meaningful XRP price movements. Finbold placed each of the company’s observed sales year-to-date on XRP’s daily chart.
So far, Ripple made its sales on January 7, 16, and 30, February 5, 11, and 20, March 5 and 13, and April 14 and 24. Interestingly, only three out of ten days had a slightly positive price action. Yet, even these ‘green’ days were made of shy gains, while the negative ones were more impactful.

As of this writing, XRP trades at $0.519, bouncing back from support at $0.50. Therefore, investors should closely monitor Ripple’s selling activities in May, as they could slow down an expected price recovery.

Australian Stock Exchange Set to Approve Spot Bitcoin ETFs by End of 2024



                    

Australia’s major stock exchange, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), may soon give the green light to several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) before the close of 2024.



VanEck Australia and local ETF-focused fund manager BetaShares are poised to have their spot Bitcoin ETF applications approved by year-end, according to insiders cited by Bloomberg, mirroring moves made by fund issuers in the United States and Hong Kong.




The surge in spot Bitcoin ETF applications follows approvals in the United States, where a total of eleven products have amassed a staggering $53 billion in assets under management (AUM).



Justin Arzadon, BetaShares’ head of digital, credited the substantial inflows into U.S.-based ETFs as a catalyst for launching similar products in Australia, asserting they demonstrate the enduring presence of digital assets.



Jeff Yew, CEO of Monochrome, a crypto asset management firm with a competing exchange application, described Australia as a “very crypto-heavy country” and anticipates Australian spot Bitcoin ETFs to draw in $3 billion to $4 billion in net inflows within the initial three years.

Yew highlighted the demand for Bitcoin ETFs among fund managers seeking exposure to Bitcoin, self-managed super fund (SMSF) investors, and a segment of retail investors.



Currently, SMSF investors carry direct exposure to Bitcoin on crypto exchanges, a practice Yew views as inherently risky, akin to a “ticking time bomb” should exchanges falter.



He emphasized the regulatory oversight and safety afforded by Bitcoin ETFs, contrasting them with direct crypto exchange exposure. 




Monochrome initially sought approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the ASX in July 14, 2023, but shifted to Cboe Australia due to the ASX’s prolonged approval process.



Yew cited Cboe Australia’s more pragmatic timeline and transparent listing framework as reasons for the switch, noting the challenges the ASX has faced with regulatory issues and limited appetite for new products. 



Despite this, Yew remains optimistic about Cboe Australia approving Monochrome’s application “within the next few weeks.”

Biggest Friend.tech whale dumps tokens as users struggle to claim airdrop

The largest airdrop recipient on Friend.tech has sold all their tokens just hours after the airdrop, leading to concerns over the token’s price action.Just hours after the Friend.tech airdrop went live on May 3, the largest whale, known as “Murphys1d,” sold over 55,000 of the newly-issued Friend tokens, blockchain data shows.Beyond the sell-off, some users were unable to claim their airdrop tokens, including crypto investor Luke Martin, who wrote in a May 3 X post:“Watching the value of my airdrop go from 7 figures to 5 figures in the span of 2 hours while I keep refreshing the page trying to claim....still can’t claim. Adds insult to injury.”Martin added that the whale wallet seems to be linked to a fake X account with no activity, enabling it to farm over 500,000 Friend.tech points risk-free.The new Friend.tech (FRIEND) token has fallen over 52.5% since its launch, from $3.26 to just $1.32 as of 9:50 am UTC. The token’s price fell over 32% in the last hour before publication, according to CoinGecko data.FRIEND/USDT chart. Source: CoinGeckoWhile the selling by the largest Friend.tech whale may impact the market in the short term, it doesn’t necessarily dictate a token’s long-term trajectory, according to Anndy Lian, intergovernmental blockchain expert and author of NFT: From Zero to Hero. Lian told Cointelegraph:“While it might cause a short-term dip in price due to increased supply and potential panic selling, it doesn’t always mean a long-term downtrend. To me, it is a good thing […] The sell-off would mean a more decentralized distribution of tokens. A broader distribution reduces the risk of a single entity having excessive control over the project.”However, Lian noted that the token’s value will mainly rely on the community’s trust in Friend.tech and how the team manages the current situation.Related: LayerZero cross-chain interoperability protocol completes first airdrop snapshotAirdrop farmers continue to plague token launchesThe mysterious Friend.tech whale is another example of a professional airdrop farmer (squatter) who interacts with emerging protocols solely for the airdrop rewards, often with multiple wallets to compound rewards.The main issue with airdrop farmers is that they tend to market sell all their airdropped tokens, creating significant sell pressure and resulting in more panic selling by legitimate protocol users.An example of this came at the end of April, when the Omni Network’s OMNI token fell 55% in less than 18 hours following its airdrop, losing over half its market capitalization.In March 2023, it was revealed that airdrop hunters consolidated $3.3 million worth of tokens from Arbitrum’s ARB airdrop from 1,496 wallets into just two wallets they had controlled.Related: ‘Mr. 100’ buys the Bitcoin dip for the first time since halving — Is the BTC bottom in?

Logos publishes privacy manifesto on largest-ever Bitcoin block from 2009 - Crypto Briefing




Logos, a decentralized and privacy-focused technology stack, has inscribed its manifesto on the largest-ever Bitcoin block, measuring 3.99 MB in size.The inscription, which precedes the launch of an Ordinals collection called Logos Operators, was made on a satoshi created in 2009 in block 3,479.Logos (also named as Logos Network), characterizes itself as a politically neutral tech stack supporting self-sovereign virtual territories. It provides the technical foundation for cyber states, parallel societies, network states, or any borderless public institution based on voluntary consent.According to Logos, the Logos Operators collection “will serve as the pseudonymous identities of the first inhabitants of the Logos technology stack that will enable people to exit the existing internet system.”The project claims that privacy should be considered a “fundamental right,” with the aim of establishing transparency and self-sovereign monetary policy. “Logos is the ancient Greek concept for the connection between language, reason, and the order of the universe,” the manifesto states.The manifesto was authored by Logos co-founder Jarrad Hope, who also worked as the co-founder of Status, open-source mobile client for Ethereum. Logos envisions a society where individuals are not “treated as machines,” emphasizing anonymity, non-elitism, and the centrality of people in its vision. The project aims to rebuild the internet to protect civil liberties by design and is actively recruiting high-level “Operators” to join the new ecosystem, which they describe as “a sovereign enclave in cyberspace.”The Logos technology stack consists of three modular protocol components, including:
Waku: A peer-to-peer messaging protocol for secure communication
Codex: A decentralized storage solution
Nomos: A Layer 1 blockchain with a focus on privacy and scalability
The project has made significant progress in recent months.

First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Hovers Around $59K to End Week

Bitcoin tested a return to $60,000 during the Asian morning on Friday before retreating to trade around $59,000. BTC has gained about 2% in the last 24 hours as it continues its recovery from a midweek rout that saw it sink below $57,000 following a drop of 16% in April, the worst month since June 2022. JPMorgan said in a report yesterday that retail investors played a bigger part in the sell-off than institutional investors. The bank is opting for a cautious stance on crypto markets in the near term due to a lack of positive catalysts. The wider crypto market has risen 1.7% in 24 hours as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20).

There Is No Option of Parole For Sam Bankman-Fried - Defense Attorney


							

According to Carlo D’Angelo, Sam Bankman-Fried’s jail destination would be determined by a couple of factors.



D’Angelo believes Bankman-Fried will not be sent to the same prison as his co-defendants.



With the absence of parole, Bankman-Fried would likely spend not less than 21 years in jail.




Renowned Crypto Criminal Defense Lawyer Carlo D’Angelo has aired his view on developments surrounding the sentencing of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. D’Angelo spoke extensively with Tiffany Fong, a renowned independent journalist covering issues around crypto crimes.







During their interaction, D’Angelo told Fong that several factors would determine Bankman-Fried’s jail destination. He explained that the Bureau of Prisons would recommend a prison destination for the convict based on several considerations. 



According to the defense attorney, the authorities would consider factors like the current inhabitants of a prison. With that, they would know if co-defendants who cooperated and testified against Bankman-Fried during litigation are in the same prison. He highlighted that having Bankman-Fried in the same environment as people who testified against him could cause problems.



D’Angelo noted that the authorities will consider the convict’s specific mental health needs. Hence, they could send him to a unit that can cater to those needs. The litigation expert noted that adding to the individual needs of Bankman-Fried, the prison authorities will try as much as possible to keep him close to his family.









Considering the length of Bankman-Fried’s sentence and the possibility of parole, D’Angelo explained that the convict would get credit for the time he served waiting for trial and sentencing. He clarified that the time credit will not cover the period when Bankman-Fried was under house arrest. 



Other than that, the defense lawyer noted that the U.S. Federal system has abolished parole for prison sentences. However, he clarified that the Bureau of Prison can award “Good Time.” According to him, that could happen if Bankman-Fried avoids having disciplinary issues. However, he noted that generally, convicts like Bankman-Fried are likely to serve about 85% of their jail term within the prison system.

Pro-XRP Lawyers Predict Ripple Will Lose Its Latest Motion


								In the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), pro-XRP community lawyers have offered a pessimistic outlook for Ripple’s latest court motion. Attorney Jeremy Hogan, known for his vocal support of Ripple in the crypto community, expressed via X (formerly Twitter) that he anticipates a loss for Ripple in its recent legal maneuver.
Ripple Will Lose This Time: Pro-XRP Lawyers Claim
Sharing his thoughts on X (formerly Twitter), Hogan remarked, “The hardest thing to do on CT is say that you think the SEC will win a motion. But HERE GOES: I think the SEC will win this motion.” He elaborated that even if the court recognizes the SEC’s witness, Andrea Fox, as an expert, the likely outcome would be similar to previous cases, where the court allowed Ripple to depose the witness rather than striking them from the record entirely. Hogan concluded his statement with a humorous but serious remark, “Now, excuse me while I go pray I’m wrong, which is not often.”
The discussion was sparked by an update from James K. Filan, a former defense lawyer, who reported on Ripple’s filing of a letter in further support of its April 22, 2024 ,motion. The motion was a reply to the SEC’s opposition, which had been filed a week prior, on April 29, 2024.


Bill Morgan, another attorney advocating for XRP, shared Hogan’s sentiment in a separate post. Morgan stated, “I think Ripple will lose the motion but the judge will accept Fox gave some expert evidence and permit Ripple to depose her. Then we can see what SEC says on May 6 in its reply brief on remedies and then await a decision on remedies.”

Notably, the court dealt with a similar situation involving the “Ferrante Declaration” earlier in the case. This declaration, much like the later Fox Declaration, was used by the SEC to summarize financial data and calculations concerning Ripple’s financial activities. Ripple had opposed this declaration, arguing against its admission, but the court permitted it as summary evidence, not as expert testimony.
However, Judge Torres allowed the declaration, treating it as permissible summary evidence under the law, rather than as expert testimony. This previous decision is likely what Jeremy Hogan refers to with “like it did before,” indicating a precedent where the court allowed Ripple to challenge a witness through deposition instead of striking the witness entirely.
Background Of The Motion
At the heart of the dispute is Ripple’s objection to the SEC’s expert declaration by Andrea Fox, which Ripple argues has been improperly categorized by the SEC. According to Ripple, Fox performs a deep analytical review of Ripple’s financial records, drawing conclusions that influence core aspects of the case, such as disgorgement calculations and pre-judgment interest.

According to the filing, “Fox analyzes Ripple’s records, third-party evidence, and expert reports; draws inferences and conclusions about those documents; and calculates disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and discount amounts based on her analysis.”. Ripple emphasizes that this level of analysis requires more than basic arithmetic, countering the SEC’s portrayal of Fox’s role.
Ripple further accuses the SEC of failing to disclose Fox’s involvement as an expert witness during the discovery phase, which they argue is a requirement under the court’s scheduling order. The filing details that the SEC’s late disclosure of Fox does not comply with the agreed timeline which was set to complete remedies-related discovery by February 20, 2024.
“Discovery could not be ‘completed,’ as the Court directed, if the SEC had not yet disclosed a witness whose testimony the agency planned to present and whose deposition Ripple had reserved its right to take”.
Moreover, Ripple contrasts Fox’s extensive and detailed declaration, which includes specialized accounting assessments, against previous summary witness testimonies cited by the SEC, which involved straightforward data compilation without analytical interpretation.
Ripple concludes that the SEC’s approach to Fox’s declaration and her qualifications contradicts their characterization of her as a non-expert, summary witness, and thus, her testimony should be struck for non-compliance with the discovery rules.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.51945.

Coinbase CEO: “Developer Activity on Base Increased Eightfold in Q1” | Cryptoglobe


                                
Base is a Layer-2 blockchain built by Coinbase on top of the Ethereum network. Layer-2 solutions are designed to enhance the scalability and efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain. Base aims to provide a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly environment for building decentralized applications (dApps).



Here’s how it works:



Rollups: Base leverages the power of “rollups,” specifically optimistic rollups. This technique bundles large batches of transactions off of the main Ethereum chain, processing them on Base for faster and cheaper execution. Only a compressed summary of the batch is then submitted back to the Ethereum mainnet for final settlement.Ethereum Security: By settling transactions back onto the Ethereum mainnet, Base inherits the robust security and decentralization properties of Ethereum.OP Stack: Base is built using Optimism’s OP Stack, an open-source toolkit for creating interoperable, cost-effective, and scalable rollups. This shared infrastructure envisions a future “superchain” of connected Layer-2 networks.



Overall, Base wants to facilitate developers’ creation of dApps that are as seamless and affordable to use as traditional web apps while maintaining the security of the Ethereum ecosystem.



Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong highlighted significant advancements in Base during the company’s first-quarter earnings call on May 2, 2024. Armstrong drew an interesting parallel, likening the evolution of blockchain through Layer 2 solutions to the internet’s leap from dial-up to broadband. This evolution is critical as it underpins the potential for blockchain technology to host a plethora of new applications within the crypto economy.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Base has made remarkable strides in enhancing the efficiency of crypto transactions. According to Armstrong, these enhancements are pivotal in achieving Coinbase’s ambitious goal of processing average crypto transactions in under one second for less than one cent worldwide. The impact of Base on the crypto transaction landscape is profound, with transaction fees and confirmation times drastically reduced. This improvement is in line with Coinbase’s strategy to make crypto transactions as seamless and cost-effective as possible.



The first quarter of 2024 saw an eightfold increase in developer activity on Base, indicating growing confidence and interest in its capabilities. Armstrong revealed that in the past 30 days alone, Base has processed more than double the transactions of the entire Ethereum Layer 1 network. This milestone not only underscores Base’s robust performance but also cements its position as the leading Layer 2 solution in terms of transaction volume.



One of the significant enhancements to Base includes an approximate 80% reduction in transaction fees through various protocol upgrades. These lower fees, often below one cent, are particularly advantageous for users and developers who seek efficient and economical blockchain interactions.



Moreover, Armstrong announced the integration of the US Dollar Coin (USDC) on Base across all Coinbase products. This integration facilitates nearly free and instant global payments in a stable, USD-denominated digital asset. Armstrong emphasized the transformative potential of this development, projecting it as a monumental step towards overhauling the global financial system. By significantly reducing the billions in payment fees currently borne by consumers and businesses, Coinbase aims to foster a more accessible and equitable financial ecosystem.

ZeroHedge will host a weird gold v. bitcoin debate today


ZeroHedge, Daniel Ivandjiiski’s popular current events blog and news brand, will moderate a debate tonight between two celebrity gold bugs versus two crypto promoters.
This evening at 7pm EDT, ZeroHedge will host gold bug Peter Schiff and ‘Dr. Doom’ Nouriel Roubini on the anti-crypto side, and Anthony Scaramucci and Erik Voorhees on the pro-crypto side.
The debate, which will stream on YouTube, will be moderated by Crypto Banter channel owner Ran Neuner. Neuner is part of Mario Nawfal’s team that rose to prominence thanks in part to Elon Musk’s endorsements of their Twitter (now X) Spaces. Neuner follows a trend of ZeroHedge using Nawfal’s team to host celebrity debates. Indeed, Nawfal himself has hosted a ZeroHedge debate.
The panelists have debated their pro-gold and pro-crypto arguments on social media for years and if they continue their tradition of talking over each other, Neuner will have to keep a firm grip on the mic controls. 

Read more: FBI and SEC likely investigating Mario Nawfal after wave of complaints
Four conflicted, talkative, bombastic debaters

Erik Voorhees is best known as the founder of ShapeShift, a digital exchange with an interesting history that included transforming into a DAO to dodge know-your-customer and anti-money laundering laws. Even with that dodge, it had to pay a settlement to the Securities and Exchange Commission for listing unregistered securities.
Anthony Scaramucci is a former senior White House staffer-turned-founder of SkyBridge Capital, a hedge fund that made money from some lucky breaks. For example, the fund manager received a phone call from Sam Bankman-Fried’s father seemingly just in time to warn him that FTX was going to collapse. It helps to have the dad of the founder of the largest pyramid scheme since Enron tip you off prior to its collapse, unlike millions of blindsided customers.
Peter Schiff has frequently bashed bitcoin and has called it worthless for years. Indeed, seven years ago, he predicted bitcoin would go to $0.00. He’s managed a gold fund that has underperformed gold for over a decade.
Nouriel Roubini is an anti-bitcoin economist frequently referred to as ‘Dr. Doom.’ He predicted bitcoin would collapse to $0 four years ago.

Neither gold nor crypto have displaced fiat
Roubini and Schiff support gold as the world’s preeminent store of value. Because gold isn’t easy to subdivide, assay, or carry for use as a medium of exchange, Schiff repeatedly endorsed Canadian debit card company GoldMoney as the best way to use gold for day-to-day transactions.
GoldMoney and its gold-backed debit card, however, never gained popularity. GoldMoney’s share price languishes 80% below its all-time high set seven years ago.
Nouriel Roubini (a.k.a. Dr. Doom) predicted bitcoin would collapse to $0 four years ago.
To be fair, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are also not easy to use for day-to-day transactions without relying on a trusted third party. Thousands of crypto merchant service companies and point-of-sale terminals have gone bankrupt. Although crypto is easy to subdivide, assay, carry, and transact on-chain, burdensome financial regulations turn its acceptance, tax treatment, and conversion into fiat an accounting compliance nightmare.
Obviously, Voorhees and Scaramucci are likely to vocalize their typical arguments for crypto like self-sovereignty, censorship-resistance, and unconfiscatability. Roubini and Schiff, meanwhile, might take a jab at Voorhees for running a company that allegedly broke US financial regulations. Voorhees’ company ShapeShift paid a $275,000 penalty to settle SEC claims that it dealt unregistered crypto securities.

3 cryptocurrencies under $0.10 to buy next week


As the current week nears its conclusion with the cryptocurrency market in the state of cautious recovery from the recent losses, some of its assets, still available at a low price threshold of under $0.10 per wholecoin, might be a good investment in the week to come.
In this context, Finbold has scoured the cryptoverse to deliver the list of three digital currencies that are currently trading at the price below just ten cents apiece and which might represent some of the best purchase choices for crypto traders and investors next week.
#1 Shiba Inu (SHIB)
As the first on the list, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently formed a bullish flag pattern on its daily chart, which crypto expert Ali Martinez pointed out could potentially lead to another upward surge, as this classic continuation chart pattern signifies a consolidation period following a strong price increase.



Currently, however, SHIB is changing hands at $0.00002275, which indicates a modest 0.25% loss in the last 24 hours while declining 10.55% across the previous seven days and accumulating a drop of 15.53% over the past month, according to the latest charts.

#2 IoTeX (IOTX)
Meanwhile, another renowned crypto expert, Michaël van de Poppe, has recommended IoTeX (IOTX), a native token of the eponymous EVM-compatible blockchain that employs a global team of more than 40 research scientists and engineers, as he earlier noted that the “altcoins momentum is on the horizon.”

For now, the price of IOTX stands at $0.05338, suggesting a gain of 0.60% on the day, as it moves to reverse the dip of 12.50% from over the past week and the amassed losses of 29.63% in the last 30 days, as per the most recent information retrieved by Finbold on May 3.

#3 SKALE (SKL)
Finally, van de Poppe has also earlier recommended SKALE (SKL), a token of the modular blockchain network promising to bring scalability to Ethereum (ETH) and which the crypto specialist recommended as an altcoin to “generate a 3X in BTC, with the lowest amount of risk.”

That said, at press time, SKL was trading at the price of $0.07321, having dropped 2.17% during the day, after declining 18.59% last week and making a more significant dive of 38.73% on its monthly chart, according to the latest data.

Conclusion
All things considered, accumulating the above cryptocurrencies under $0.10 might be a good idea for the upcoming week, but it is important to remember that things in this sector can sometimes make a sudden turn, so doing one’s own research is critical before investing in any of them.

Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE: LNG) has recently disclosed its financial outcomes for the first quarter of 2024, showcasing a robust performance that underscores the company’s strong position in the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market.



During this period, Cheniere reported remarkable revenues of approximately $4.3 billion, an impressive net income of around $0.5 billion, and a solid Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.8 billion.



Furthermore, the company generated a Distributable Cash Flow of about $1.2 billion, indicating a healthy financial status and operational efficiency. These results reflect Cheniere’s adept management and strategic operations, positioning it as a leading provider of LNG with a significant competitive edge in the energy sector.



In addition to its financial achievements, Cheniere has confidently reconfirmed its full-year 2024 financial guidance, projecting a Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA ranging between $5.5 billion to $6.0 billion and a Distributable Cash Flow between $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion.



This forward-looking stance is supported by the company’s comprehensive capital allocation plan, which saw the repurchase of approximately 7.5 million shares of common stock for about $1.2 billion, the prepayment of $150 million of consolidated long-term indebtedness, and the payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.435 per share of common stock.



Cheniere Energy Outperforms Revenue Expectations in Q1, EPS Miss



Cheniere’s performance in the first quarter notably exceeded revenue expectations ($4.25 billion reported against $3.97 billion expected) with the actual earnings per share (EPS) of $2.13 falling short of the expected $2.29.



The comparison of these results against market expectations underscores Cheniere’s robust business model and its adeptness in navigating the complexities of the energy sector. 





Cheniere’s Guidance for Full Year 2024 Remains Optimistic



Looking ahead, Cheniere’s guidance for the full year 2024 remains optimistic, with the company poised to achieve its projected financial targets. This optimism is rooted in the company’s strategic initiatives and operational efficiencies, which are expected to continue driving growth and profitability. Cheniere’s focus on excellence in execution across its operations, construction, and project development initiatives is pivotal to its success.



The company’s ongoing pursuit of LNG capacity expansions at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi further exemplifies its commitment to enhancing energy security, reliability, and environmental benefits for its customers. With a proven track record and a clear strategic vision, Cheniere is well-positioned to navigate the future challenges and opportunities within the global LNG market, thereby delivering sustained value to its stakeholders.

CryptoPunks’ all-time sales volume now stands at an impressive US$2.82 billion as the third best-selling set of NFTs.



CryptoPunk 7846 was the highest-valued NFT to change hands on Thursday. It sold for US$557,804 in Ether, around US$300,000 lower than its last sale.



Fellow Ethereum collection Bored Ape Yacht Club claimed the third spot in daily sales, generating US$1.06 million. Yuga Labs’ flagship collection is the second best-selling NFT, withUS$3.14 billion.



Other notable movements in the top 10 list NFT market include DMarket, which saw a slight decrease in daily sales to US$899,114.68. $WZRD BRC-20 NFTs experienced a more than twofold increase in daily sales, jumping to US$718,591.

Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE) Launches on Solana, Will Rally 7,200% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Skinny Doge presents a similar opportunity.



Skinny Doge has market cap below $13,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,200% in the coming two days, and Skinny Doge could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Skinny Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Skinny Doge on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Skinny Doge by entering its contract address – 913qkdtENF3qvSBZjtoNxETZi93xHgRDuHNGvdzkECF4 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SKINDOGE.

Top Analyst Says One Blue-Chip Altcoin ‘Begging To Break Out,’ Updates Outlook on Bitcoin and Ethereum - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is expressing bullish sentiment on a top-10 altcoin by market capitalization.
The analyst pseudonymously known as DonAlt tells 59,100 subscribers of the TechnicalRoundup YouTube channel that the price action of BNB, the native token of the BNB Chain, is currently signaling massive upside potential.










“I like BNB… I like the BNB chart. This is BNB/USD [chart], it’s basically begging to break out. I think a dip on this would just be a buy.”
BNB is trading at $561 at time of writing.
According to the pseudonymous analyst, the fourth-largest crypto asset by market cap would cease being attractive for a long opportunity if it drops by around 20% from the current level.
“Anything below $450 would start looking a little bit dicey. But just generally this just looks very strong. 
And then if you go on the BNB/BTC pair, you see what absolute dominance looks like. That’s actually a really good looking chart. So if you actually want to have a coin that looks good… BNB is one of them. That chart looks excellent.”
Next up is Bitcoin (BTC). According to the closely followed analyst, the behavior of Bitcoin around two key levels will signal where the flagship crypto asset is likely to head to next.
“I think any close above $70,000 [on the monthly chart] is probably going to go towards $80,000, $90,000… any close below $57,000 is probably going to go towards like $45,000.”
Bitcoin is trading at $58,840 at time of writing.
On Ethereum (ETH), DonAlt says,
“If the weekly closes above $3,000 this week… then we can talk about maybe going back to $4,000. So like I’m more bullish in ETH than I have been in almost years at this point.”
Ethereum is trading at $2,988 at time of writing.

Friend.tech Community in Uproar Amid Token and V2 Launch - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsSocial crypto platform Friend.tech has launched its new native token alongside version two (V2) of the decentralized social media. But so far, it's not going very smoothly.FRIEND tokens were supposed to be airdropped to those captured in an April snapshot. Unfortunately, it appears that many users have struggled to claim their tokens.“Literally all my friend.tech points are gone and I have 0 FRIEND to claim?” one Twitter user panicked. “I'm NOT selling my FRIEND airdrop (Cause I can't even claim it),” another said.Friend.tech launched in August 2023, quickly gaining a ton of hype as well as a fair few critics. The decentralized social network, on Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Base, allows users to buy and sell “keys” that are linked to Twitter accounts.Friend.tech did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.Now with the launch of version two of the platform, which happened alongside the token airdrop, users are also able to join community owned spaces called Clubs that are operated by key holders.But even those who managed to claim their tokens weren’t happy with its price tanking 46% from $2.78 to $1.49 in less than four hours, according to CoinGecko. The community believes the devs only adding $0.01 in liquidity is the primary factor in its value tanking so quickly.Even those who were in it for the social media platform were left short changed as it appears that the new Clubs feature—a key step for gaining airdrop eligibility—isn’t working as planned. Users are reporting that the platform is not registering that they have joined a club or that newly made clubs aren’t showing on the platform.“This shitty SocialFi app [is] still not verifying [the] join club step,” one Twitter user moaned. “I hate Friendtech.”This has resulted in a number of community members turning against what was previously the darling of the Web3 industry—some threatening to dump their tokens the moment they’re airdropped.“I had a lot of hope with friend.tech V2,” Twitter user mcSleuth said. “Here we are after V2, app still looks like shit, is slow as fuck and after 8 months the only update we got was 'clubs' (which people are only using to claim their airdrop and dump it).” He continued, “how does one fumble this bad.”Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Binance helped ED In India, Exposed Scam Apps


                                Binance Gives Hand To ED To Cut Off Scam Apps In India                                Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange is getting ready to come back to India After being banned for a while in the Indian market, preparing to pay a fine of $2 million. However, Besides this, Binance has taken a step that could improve its standing with the Indian government. Recently, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in India cracked down on an online scam app named E-Nuggets, seizing around $10 million. What's particularly noteworthy is that Binance, along with ZebPay and WazirX helped ED in uncovering this significant scam. According to reports, E-Nuggets had approximately $10 million stored across 70 different cryptocurrency wallets associated with these three exchanges. The ED reached out to them to block these wallet addresses and transfer the crypto assets to the agency's wallet, and all three exchanges cooperated. By assisting in exposing a scam app, Binance seems to be trying to demonstrate to the Indian government its commitment to following all regulations and also aiding in stopping any illegal activities. This fits with Binance's plan to meet all of India's conditions before fully coming back into the market.Binance Keen To Get Back In Good Books Of Indian GovernmentBinance aims to get back in the good books of the Indian government. After being banned in India for about four months now again Binance is fully prepared to return. Recently, the Binance Exchange paid a fine of $2 million for this purpose. Binance is ready to comply with all the conditions set by the Indian government for its return, including registration with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), paying penalties, and following all applicable laws in India, such as the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the VDA Taxation Framework. In doing so, assisting the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in cracking down on a scam app is also part of Binance's strategy. This sends a message to the Indian government that Binance not only intends to abide by all necessary rules in India but also is willing to assist the government in preventing any illegal activities.ConclusionAccording to Coin Gabbar, Binance understands that to capture big markets like India, it must comply with all the conditions set by the Indian government. If it falls behind in doing so, it might face expulsion from the country. However, considering the current situation, being excluded from significant markets like India could be detrimental for any crypto exchange, especially for Binance, which is the world's largest crypto exchange. Therefore, Binance is not only willing to stand by all rules and regulations in India but also planning to introduce payment solutions, establish a dedicated Indian team, and invest in India's blockchain system. It can be hoped that Binance will soon be included in the good books of the Indian government and may receive some concessions from the Indian government in the future. This step will help Binance run its operations smoothly in significant countries like India. Also Read: Block Co-Founder Jack Dorsey Planning To Buy BTC

April Job Report Shows Cooling Labor Market, Unemployment Hits 3.9% - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April job report on Friday, revealing a cooling labor market with narrower job gains across several major industries. The report showed that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in April, falling short of economists’ expectations.



Despite the slowdown in job growth, the unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.9%, while average hourly earnings increased by 0.2% month-over-month and 3.9% year-over-year. 



Job Growth and Wage Pressures



The healthcare industry led the way in job creation, adding 56,000 jobs, followed by social assistance with 31,000 jobs, transportation and warehousing with 22,000 jobs, and retail trade with 20,000 jobs. The average workweek was reduced to 34.3 hours, indicating a potential slowdown in economic activity. Revisions to previous months’ job growth figures showed that February’s job growth was revised down from 270,000 to 236,000, while March’s job growth was revised up from 303,000 to 315,000.



Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that wage pressures were not creating a significant inflationary impulse, citing declining trends from peak levels during the post-pandemic recovery period. The labor force participation rate held steady at 62.7%, and the employment-population ratio remained little changed at 60.2%.





Market Reaction and Economic Implications



As of the time of writing, the stock market responded positively to the April job report, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rising by 322.37 points or 0.85%, the NASDAQ Composite increasing by 235.48 points or 1.51%, and the S&P 500 gaining 45.81 points or 0.91%. The bond market reaction, however, suggested an increase in demand for safer investments, with the US 10-year Treasury Yield dropping by 0.096 percentage points to 4.475%, possibly due to concerns over slowing job growth and uncertainty over future economic growth.



Commodities like gold and oil rose, with gold increasing by $13.4 or 0.58% and crude oil going up by $0.59 or 0.75%, indicating a hedge against potential inflation and economic uncertainty. The Euro (EUR/USD) slightly strengthened against the dollar, moving up by 0.718%, while the Japanese Yen (USD/JPY) weakened against the dollar, dropping by 1.015%.



The April job report suggests that the U.S. economy is experiencing a gradual slowdown in job growth, which may help ease inflationary pressures. However, the slower pace of job creation also raises concerns about the sustainability of the economic recovery and the potential impact on consumer spending and business investment.



As the Federal Reserve continues to monitor the labor market and inflation data, policymakers will need to carefully navigate the challenges of maintaining price stability while supporting economic growth in the coming months.







Do you think the Federal Reserve will conduct two rate cuts this year, as expected by consensus after the jobs report? Let us know in the comments.

We Asked AI to Predict Kentucky Derby Winners-Here Are Its Picks - Decrypt

In the world of horse racing, tomorrow's Kentucky Derby is the Super Bowl, the World Series, and the NBA Finals all rolled into one. The “greatest two minutes in sports” is the marquee matchup in a series of over a dozen races, but if predicting the outcome of the March Madness basketball tourney is tricky, it gets even harder when you combine both human and equine unpredictability.Throw in factors like the weather and conditions of each race track, and the odds of picking winners—the obsession that drives the $500 billion horse racing market—are not exactly in your favor.In one 20-horse race, the odds of correctly picking the winner are simply 1 in 20. But wagering on horse races can get  complicated. If you want to predict the exact order of the top two, three, or four horses, known as an exacta, trifecta, and superfecta, the odds skyrocket to 1 in 380, 1 in 6,840, and 1 in 103,025.But wait! There's more! Players often “box” their choices to increase the chance of winning. This means they bet on all possible combinations of their favored horses. The odds of winning a boxed exotic bet are better than playing them straight, 1 in 190 for a boxed exacta, 1 in 1,140 for a boxed trifecta, and 1 in 16,215 for a boxed superfecta. However, the payouts are also reduced accordingly.Some bettors might relish the prospect of spending hours poring over stats and racing forms, but we invested our time in creating a tool to get us to an answer more quickly—meanwhile crafting a system that can be called up when the next Kentucky Derby draws near.Enter AIThere are a variety of ways to enlist artificial intelligence in horse racing. You could process reams of data based on your own methodology, trust a third-party pre-trained model, or even build a bespoke solution from the ground up. We decided to build a GPT we named it HorseGPT to crunch the numbers and make the picks for us.A GPT is a type of AI agent built atop a large language model like ChatGPT from market leader OpenAI. A customized agent works with a set of pre-defined prompts and training data to guide its behavior. This approach is less complex than training a model from the ground up, but proved to be good enough to pick winners and defend those choices.We did start from scratch in one sense: we were completely new to playing the horses, and don't know the first thing about “handicapping nags” or other terms of art. The most popular AI chatbots were similarly ignorant at first.We carefully curated prompts to instill HorseGPT with expertise in data science specific to horse racing: how weather affects times, the role of jockeys and riding styles, the importance of post positions, and so on. We then fed it a mix of research papers and blogs covering the theoretical aspects of wagering, and layered on practical knowledge: how to read racing forms, what the statistics mean, which factors are most predictive, expert betting strategies, and more.Finally, we gave HorseGPT a wealth of historical Kentucky Derby data, arming it with the raw information needed to put its freshly imparted skills to use.We unleashed HorseGPT on official racing forms for this year's Derby. We asked HorseGPT to carefully analyze each race's form, identify the top contenders, and recommend wager types and strategies based on deep background knowledge derived from race statistics.The big fourWithout further ado, here are HorseGPT's predictions for the 150th “Running of the Roses” at the 2024 Kentucky Derby on Saturday. The main race is race number 12.Given the profiles of the horses and their racing styles, here’s its recommended betting strategy:
Win Bets: Place win bets on both Sierra Leone and Fierceness. These horses have demonstrated consistent performance and high potential for winning, making them solid choices for direct win bets.
Each-Way Bet: Consider an each-way bet on Just a Touch. This horse shows potential but might not be as strong a favorite as the others, offering a good balance for a bet that covers both winning and placing.
As for so-called exotic bets?
Exacta Box: Box Sierra Leone and Fierceness in an exacta. This bet will win if either horse finishes first and the other second, in any order.
Trifecta Box: Box Sierra Leone, Fierceness, and Just a Touch. This covers more combinations, increasing the chance of a high payout if these top contenders finish in the top three in any order.
Superfecta Bet: For a higher-risk but higher-reward bet, place a superfecta picking Sierra Leone, Fierceness, Just a Touch, and include a dark horse like Mystik Dan or Domestic Product based on their potential to outperform expectations under muddy conditions.
A second and third opinionTo double and triple check our work, we did give other powerful AI tools and models a spin. However, building agents with Claude or Reka required API credits and careful coding. Cutting to the chase, we attempted to rely on their  respective massive training datasets, building an elaborate prompt to secure their winning picks.Interestingly enough, our HorseGPT AI agent and the other out-of-the-box chatbots seemed to agree with each other, and with many experts analysts cited by the official Kentucky Derby website. Just a Touch was the only aberration. HorseGPT put it in a top-three spot, but the other experts—AI and human—went with Catching Freedom instead.That said, some human experts like James Cully and Kaitilin Free are also optimistic about Just a TOuch.The top three by consensus among our AIs and our mixed slate of experts is to bet on Sierra Leone, Fierceness, and Catching Freedom.Hold your horsesWe didn't know how to read a racing form, but HorseGPT could break down each statistic and factor in mere minutes after being coached with prompts and research material. We may not be handicapping savants, but we fed our model information provided by experts. That's the power of these large language models: if you know how to work with a chatbot, but once you've ‘taught’ them and fed them high-quality information, they rapidly acquire domain expertise.But before you rush off to place bets—if allowed under the laws of your local jurisdiction—remember that predicting anything as messy as humans—whether it's bracketology, horse racing, or even stock market trends—requires nuance. AI and conventional mathematic models analyze past performance and make predictions based on "ceteris paribus," or status quo, conditions.But they can't predict extraordinary circumstances like an injury, a sudden rain, or a jockey or horse simply having a bad day. That unpredictability, of course, is part of the thrill.Bonus picks for the other racesUnlike a human bettor, HorseGPT doesn't tire of crunching numbers. So we also asked our AI model to digest the racing form for each of the other eleven races this weekend. The amount of data available was not the same, admittedly, but HorseGPT applied the same methodology. For the completists, here were the results.Race 1:Win Bet: Pure Force is a strong candidate for a win bet given his solid workouts, strong breeding, and trainer's track record.Exotic Bets:
Exacta: Box Pure Force and Evan On Earth. Both horses have shown good form and could end up as the top two.
Trifecta: Box Pure Force, Evan On Earth, and Top Gun Rocket. Adding Top Gun Rocket could catch a mid-pack finisher improving with equipment changes.
Superfecta: Add Lou's Legacy to the trifecta box for a superfecta bet, banking on his consistency to grab a lower-tier finish.
Race 2:Win Bet: Scylla due to strong performances and favorable conditions.Exotic Bets:
Exacta Box: Play with Scylla, Coppa Girl, and Joke Sisi.
Trifecta Box: Add Steel Racer for depth given the competitive ML odds and past performance.
Superfecta: Include Zawish and Victorious for their potential in past performance at Churchill Downs.
Race 3:Win Bet: Mindframe due to the highest potential shown in debut and strong workouts.Exotic Bets:
Exacta Box: Mindframe and Invigorated. Both horses show strong early career forms.
Trifecta Part Wheel: Mindframe, Invigorated, and Cornishman in varying positions.
Superfecta Additions: Consider adding Elephants Ear and Bee Dancer for their consistent performances to increase coverage.
Race 4:Win Bet: Place win bets on Best Actor due to high consistency and performance, particularly if the track remains dry.Exotic Bets:
Place/Show Bets: Strong Quality and U. S. Army are good candidates for Place and Show bets, offering a balance of risk and reward with their solid track records.
Exactas and Trifectas: Consider an exacta box between Best Actor, Strong Quality, and U. S. Army. For trifectas, adding a slightly less favored horse like Denington or Five Star General might yield higher payouts if they manage to sneak into the top three.
Race 5:Top Picks: Pure Force and Lou's Legacy stand out based on their training and past performances.Win Bet: Pure Force seems a strong contender for a win bet.Exotic Bets:
Consider a box with Pure Force, Lou's Legacy, and Evan On Earth.
Longshot Bet: Manfredi could be a valuable bet for superfecta placements due to his fast training times despite low race figures.
Race 6:Win/Place Bets: Alva Starr and Vahva are the most consistent and should be considered for win/place bets.Exotic Bets:
Consider a trifecta box including Alva Starr, Red Carpet Ready, and Vahva. This selection balances the field's top performers with proven records.
Longshots: For those looking for higher risk but higher reward bets, consider adding Flying Connection to exotic bets like superfecta given her decent performance but lower rating.
Race 7:Win Bets: Chili Flag and Walkathon are compelling choices for win bets due to their strong performances and experience on turf.Place/Show Bets: Ag Bullet and Cairo Consort are suitable for place and show bets, given their solid records and ability to perform under pressure.Exotic Bets: Consider a trifecta or superfecta box including Chili Flag, Walkathon, Ag Bullet, and Cairo Consort to capitalize on their combined strengths.Race 8:Win Bets: Top Conor and Nash appear to be the strongest bets based on their high Beyer figures and earnings.
Place/Show Bets: Consider Beeline and Vlahos for place/show bets due to their potential and performance metrics.Exotic Bets: A trifecta box involving Top Conor, Nash, and Beeline or Vlahos might be promising. Adjust based on the latest track conditions and any pre-race observations.Race 9:Top Picks for Dry Track: Legend of Time, Neat, and Set.Top Picks for Muddy Track: Legend of Time, Neat, and Cugino.Exotic Bets: Consider a trifecta box including Legend of Time, Neat, and Set or Cugino. Add Stay Hot for superfecta bets, particularly in dry conditions.Potential Longshots: Blue Eyed George and Lord Bullingdon could offer value in more complex betting structures like superfectas due to their moderate ratings but potential for upset.Race 10:Win Bets: Tejano Twist and Gun Pilot appear to be strong choices based on their Beyer figures and proven performances.Place/Show Bets: Mr. Wireless and Three Technique are suitable for place and show bets, given their solid records.Exotic Bets: Consider a trifecta or superfecta including Tejano Twist, Gun Pilot, Mr. Wireless, and Three Technique to capitalize on their combined strengths.Race 11:Win Bets: I'm Very Busy stands out due to its high Beyer figure and recent performance, making it a strong candidate for win bets.Place/Show Bets: Integration and Program Trading have shown consistent performance, making them good candidates for place or show bets.Exotic Bets: A trifecta box involving I'm Very Busy, Far Bridge, and Program Trading could yield a high return, leveraging their combined strengths and track compatibility.Race 13:Win Bet: General Partner: due to its strong performances, highest earnings in the field, and solid Beyer figures.Place/Show Bets:
Discreet Mischief: Bet on place/show given its impressive Beyer of 117 and proven ability in dirt sprints, making it a strong candidate in dry conditions.
Jefferson Street: Also consider for place/show due to its solid performance history and good adaptability to both dry and slightly muddy conditions.
Exotic Bets:
Exacta Box: General Partner and Discreet Mischief: These two horses because of their top performance metrics and proven track records, which make them the strongest contenders for the top two positions.
Trifecta Box: General Partner, Discreet Mischief, and Jefferson Street: Add Jefferson Street for its consistent earning and ability to finish strong, making this trio likely to dominate the top three spots.
Superfecta: Include Pirate or Raging Torrent: Consider these for the fourth spot in superfecta bets. Pirate has shown some strong performances and could be a dark horse in this race, especially with an experienced jockey like I. Ortiz, Jr. Raging Torrent has consistent Beyer figures and could perform well if the pace is fast, making either a solid choice to round out the top four.
Race 14:Win Bet: Gun Party due to consistent performance and good finishing strength.Place/Show Bets: Timeout and Dive Bomber are recommended for their high potential and strong debut performances.Exotic Bets:
Exacta Box: Gun Party and Timeout because of their top performance metrics and promising track records.
Trifecta Box: Add Dive Bomber to the mix for his speed figures and potential under dry conditions.
Superfecta: Consider including Banned for Life as a wildcard due to his training speeds and high Beyer figure.

USDC overtakes USDT: Compliance is key to stablecoin dominance

Tether has long dominated the stablecoin sector thanks in large part to USDT’s status as the first fiat-backed stablecoin.However, new serious competitors have entered the stablecoin market over the past several years, giving USDT (USDT) a run for its money.Since 2024, the transaction volume of Circle’s stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), has been on the rise. According to payments giant Visa, USDC’s monthly transactions flipped USDT for the first time in December 2023. In March 2024, USDC’s transaction volume began to rise steadily, maintaining its dominance while USDT lost transaction volume. On March 24, 2024, USDC closed the week with almost five times more volume than USDT. On April 21, 2024, USDT’s weekly transaction volume downtrend continued, shrinking to $89 billion while USDC increased to $455 billion.While USDC launched in 2018, it has already reached 20% of the total stablecoin market. The battle for stablecoin leadership is clearly between USDT and USDC, as together they cover 90% of the total stablecoin market, according to a January 2024 report from crypto exchange OKX.According to on-chain data, USDC is absorbing crypto’s institutional adoption. This may threaten USDT’s hegemony, as institutional investors are expected to drive the bull market.Stablecoins race to attract institutional investors The crypto market has evolved greatly over the years, from a market flooded by fraudulent projects in the initial coin offering (ICO) era to a market that is set to onboard major institutional investors following the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds earlier this year. The crypto market has matured and may have stepped into a “new phase” where “compliance is super important,” as former Binane CEO Changpeng Zhao posted on X on May 2.Recent: Bitcoin L2s set to explode as Runes congest BTC networkThis focus on compliance is opening up competition between companies that wish to attract the new wave of investors entering the crypto market — i.e., stablecoins that are compliant will come out on top.In this regard, USDT — which has previously been the target of reports casting doubt on the fidelity of its reserves — faces a challenge.Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at fintech firm and crypto exchange YouHodler, told Cointelegraph:“USDT is an offshore stablecoin with a lack of transparency and regulation, while USDC is closely watched by U.S. authorities.”Tether is based in the British Virgin Islands, which is considered a tax haven for off-shore banking. In contrast, USDC issuer Circle is under U.S. jurisdiction, as it’s based in Boston, Massachusetts. USDC’s strategy of branding itself as a fully regulated, transparent stablecoin may be pushing Tether to try to clean up its public image. On April 1, it completed a “gold standard” independent audit from the ​​American Institute of Certified Accountants.Upcoming regulation frameworks in the United States and Europe may be factors that attract regulatory-compliant users to use USDC over USDT. On April 17, the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act was introduced in the United States Congress. If it becomes law, it will affect all stablecoins in the U.S. market.If Tether wishes to get a stamp of approval from U.S. authorities, it will need to change its off-shore establishment to avoid missing out on one of the biggest markets in the world.In the European Union market, the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets regulatory framework will require stablecoin issuers to register as e-money issuers starting June 30. In anticipation of the regulations coming into full effect later this year, Circle has placed EURC — the sister version of USDC, pegged to the euro — in an advantageous position. Recent: Binance ties SAFU fund to USDC: Is the fund missing out on potential gains?On March 21, 2023, Circle applied for a Digital Asset Service Provider license from the French regulatory authorities. The permissions would grant Circle to become a registered digital asset service provider, which would “enable Circle to on-shore its flagship product for the European market” and “begin the process to become MiCA conforming e-money token under the new regime,” according to a press release. Tether still hasn’t applied to become an e-money issuer in the EU.USDC’s consolidation in transaction volume may be a cue that Tether should not ignore. If it becomes the norm, Tether may have already lost its crown as the king of stablecoins.

FTX Exec Loses Paradise, Surrenders $5.9 Million Bahamas Mansion


								The implosion of cryptocurrency giant FTX continues to cast a long shadow, with the latest twist involving a Bahamas mansion and a plea deal. Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, a subsidiary of the now-bankrupt exchange, has agreed to forfeit his luxury home on the Caribbean island as part of a criminal prosecution settlement.

FTX: The Spectacular Rise And Fall
Once a shining star in the crypto-verse, FTX boasted a valuation of $32 billion at its peak. However, the company’s house of cards came tumbling down in November 2022. Allegations of misuse of customer funds and mismanagement sparked a liquidity crisis, leading to the crypto exchange’s sudden bankruptcy filing. The collapse sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, wiping out billions of dollars in investor wealth and eroding trust in the industry.


Salame’s Bahamas Dealings
According to court documents filed by the company’s debtors with the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, Salame faces charges of conspiracy to make illegal campaign contributions, mislead election authorities, and operate an unlicensed money transmitter business. The filing also sheds light on a curious Bahamas property transaction.
A $5.9 Million House Financed By Alameda Research
The court documents allege that in September 2021, Salame agreed to purchase a $7.2 million mansion in the Bahamas. Notably, a 10% deposit for the property came from an account belonging to Alameda Research, another FTX affiliate implicated in the exchange’s downfall. Just two months later, FTX Digital Markets itself wired the remaining balance to Salame’s attorney from a Bahamas bank account.

Turning A Paradise Property Into Repayment
With Salame pleading guilty to the criminal charges, the plea deal offers a unique solution. Instead of a traditional cash restitution of $5.6 million, Salame will surrender ownership of his Bahamas residence to FTX debtors. This arrangement seems to benefit both parties.
Salame avoids the hassle and potential financial loss of selling the property in a currently sluggish Bahamas real estate market, where high-end sales volumes have reportedly dropped by as much as 25%. For FTX debtors, the mansion presents a tangible asset that can be liquidated to recoup some of the lost funds owed to creditors.

Lingering Questions And Regulatory Scrutiny
The FTX saga continues to raise questions about the company’s internal financial controls and the conduct of its executives. Salame’s Bahamas property deal, funded by an FTX affiliate, raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the use of customer funds.

Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs To Reach $1 Billion AUM By 2024 End, Kraken Unit Predicts | Bitcoinist.com


								London-based CF Benchmarks, a unit of crypto exchange Kraken, is positioning itself as a notable beneficiary of the surge in spot Bitcoin ETFs this year and shares an increasingly bullish outlook for the ETF market in Hong Kong and the US through 2024. 
According to Bloomberg, with the recent debut of these ETFs in the US in January and their subsequent launch in Hong Kong, CF Benchmarks has become a key reference data provider for approximately $24 billion of cryptocurrency ETFs. This figure is dominated by Bitcoin funds, including the $15.9 billion vehicle offered by BlackRock in the US.
Bitcoin ETFs Set To Shine In Hong Kong
CF Benchmarks licenses its benchmarks to the ETFs and earns fees based on assets under management. The company currently represents around half of the crypto benchmarking market and is actively collaborating with the new Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong. 

Sui Chung, the CEO of CF Benchmarks, told Bloomberg that he envisions expanding crypto ETFs into other markets such as South Korea and Israel. Chung notes that South Korea, in particular, has seen ETFs become the preferred option for long-term savings and has shown a high level of adoption of digital assets.
Notably, while CF Benchmarks initially anticipated $5 billion in assets for the US spot-Bitcoin ETFs utilizing its indexes, the actual amount has exceeded four times that figure. 
Looking ahead, Chung expects the Hong Kong products to accumulate as much as $1 billion in funds under management by the end of 2024.
Contrasting Trends
The introduction of ETFs in the US sparked a significant rally, propelling Bitcoin to an all-time high of nearly $74,000 in March. However, since then, the token has experienced a decline, shedding approximately 20%, to a current trading price of $59,000 as investor demand for the funds waned.

On Wednesday, the group of nearly a dozen US products faced its largest daily net outflow, resulting in assets under management standing at approximately $47 billion.

On the other hand, Hong Kong’s emerging market recorded a trading volume of HK$48.91 million (approximately US$6.26 million) for six Hong Kong-based ETFs on May 3. 
Among the six Hong Kong spot ETFs for virtual assets, the Bitcoin ETF commanded the lion’s share of trading volume, accounting for HK$43.41 million. Additionally, the Ethereum ETF recorded a trading volume of HK$5.5 million.
In contrast to the Hong Kong market, the trading volume of US-based Bitcoin ETFs soared to an impressive $1.72 billion on May 2.

EigenLayer has been in the news this week after it announced its ‘stakedrop,’ where it will distribute EIGEN tokens to early users of the restaking platform. 
Sreeram Kannan, founder and CEO of EigenLayer, and Robert Drost, CEO and executive director of the Eigen Foundation, discuss the launch of the token, a “universal intersubjective work token” and how it allows for slashing, or penalizing, for externally observable faults, such as data unavailability. The Eigen Foundation, a non-profit entity based in the Cayman Islands, was also recently established to grow the protocol and assist in creating a decentralized community. 
They also address criticisms of the token’s launch, including geoblocking and the initial non-transferability of stakedrops for the community and explain why they decided to allocate an additional 100 EIGEN tokens for all participants in the stakedrop. Plus, they reveal a target date by when a decision about the token unlock date should be made. 
Show highlights:



The buzz around the universal intersubjective work token and what it was created for
What constitutes the digital commons and its two primary characteristics
How the EIGEN token is designed to prevent the necessity of forking an entire blockchain
Whether dapps should evolve into AVSes and EigenLayer’s complementary role to Ethereum, not replacing it
Why the Eigen Foundation was established and how it differs from Eigen Labs
Robert’s response to the criticism regarding the exclusion of certain countries
Why EIGEN will be distributed linearly, despite it potentially favoring whales
EigenLayer’s announcement of an updated stakedrop, after listening to community feedback

The Bitcoin halving is over - greener mining is coming - Blockworks


People typically care about price above all else when it comes to the Bitcoin halving.
Instead, what they should be paying attention to is the net positive Bitcoin can have for the future of humanity. 
While Bitcoin has long been criticized for being bad for the environment, the trend toward renewables and mining actually shows the opposite. Yes, fossil fuels are still a major component of the Bitcoin network, but with the halving freshly behind us and the block subsidy cut in half, miners with fewer operational expenses, like renewables, will continue their ascent. 
The halving will be a catalyst for a greener, more renewable bitcoin mining movement to finally be recognized among its most staunch critics as a net positive for the environment.
Fossil fuels are the fiat of bitcoin mining 
Bitcoin mining has been constantly criticized for its energy consumption and use of non-renewable energy sources. While the trend is reversing, a significant portion of bitcoin mining still relies on fossil fuels. 
But why has there been a reliance on fossil fuels in the first place? Simply because fossil fuels have incredibly high energy density and are relatively stable, making them ideal as an energy carrier. 
Read more from our opinion section: This Bitcoin halving cycle, miners need a new energy strategy
While fossil fuel plants have relatively low upfront costs to build, they require the continuous procurement of fuel, i.e. low capex high opex. And that fuel is subject to variable pricing and increasingly prone to shocks. With climate change taking center stage this year, and with the role fossil fuels play, there is increased regulatory risk. Fossil fuels are essentially borrowing against the future for instant gratification, and it is we the people who will inevitably foot the bill for the consequences, with compounding interest. This is the definition of high time preference thinking — and it’s antithetical to Bitcoin’s philosophy. 
But the good news is that there is a trend toward renewables and longer term, low time preference thinking already taking shape. 
The economics of renewables 
In addition to the environmental benefits, the shift towards renewable energy sources in bitcoin mining also makes economic sense. While renewables have a high initial capital expense, once they are installed, the energy produced has a low marginal cost — it costs nothing for the sun to shine or the wind to blow or the geo to therm. If there is no buyer for any given kWh, then the cost of said unit of energy will go to $0. This is increasingly the case for renewable generation capacity that has yet to connect to the grid.
What’s more, renewable energy sources like ocean thermal, wind and solar power, have become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels in recent years. As a result, miners using renewable energy sources can enjoy lower operational costs, making them better positioned to weather the reduced block subsidy as we progress through the fifth epoch. 
Additionally, the use of renewable energy sources enables energy sovereignty and decentralization. Whereas only a few nations have fossil fuel deposits, every country has access to renewables. This has led to massive centralization in the energy industry where a handful of super majors and state-run oil companies exert vertical control on the entire supply chain. 
Facing the long term economics  
Despite the economics favoring renewables over fossil fuels for the bitcoin mining industry, there are still challenges to overcome in the long term. The external cost of fossil fuel use has yet to be factored into their cost. This amounts to a government and taxpayer subsidy that artificially depresses the price today, making fossil fuel use more attractive in the short term.
What’s more, the intermittency of some renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, poses grid balancing challenges. But in areas with significant renewable energy resources, like Texas, bitcoin mining is gaining recognition for its ability to nearly instantaneously cycle on and off. During times of excess production, mining facilities provide a buyer for unused energy, while during high demand, the facilities are able to shut down to free up that power. This unique attribute is being integrated directly into the generation side, expanding renewables to new frontiers.
Gradually, then suddenly
As bitcoin mining continues to favor renewables and decarbonize energy markets in this fifth epoch, it will be undeniable how powerful this one two punch is. We will see more renewable, off-grid mining operations pop up, and we will even see historically dominant fossil fuel miners integrate renewables into their mix. It will likely take bitcoin mining catalyzing a new renewable energy source, like ocean thermal, for some of the staunchest critics outside of the industry to come around and see mining as a net positive. But it’s only a matter of time.

Apple Shatters Records with Unprecedented $110 Billion Stock Buyback | Cryptoglobe


                                
Tech giant Apple unveiled a record $110 billion stock buyback program, the largest ever seen in the United States above the firm’s own previous buyback programs of $90 to $100 billion seen in 2021 and 2018, respectively.



Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said the number is “astonishing,” with sheer size of the buyback program sparking speculation, as  some analysts suggested it signals a shift in Apple’s identity.



Sosnick posits that Apple might be transitioning from a “high-powered growth stock” reliant on research and development to a “value stock” prioritizing shareholder returns.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The company holds the top six spots on the list of the ten largest U.S. share-repurchase announcements, further distancing itself from competitors like Chevron, whose largest buyback was of $75 billion, and Google’s parent company Alphabet, whose largest buyback was of $70 billion.



The news of the buyback program coincided with Apple’s positive quarterly results, exceeding Wall Street expectations. The company not only surpassed sales estimates but also projected a return to revenue growth in the current quarter.



Additionally, Apple extended its streak of consecutive quarterly dividend increases to twelve years. The company currently pays investors $0.24 per share, with a dividend yield just above the 0.5% level. Its stock price rose over 8% in premarket trading to now stand above $180.

Friend Tech Token Tanks After Shambled Debut - The Defiant

Friend Tech copped backlash as many users struggled to claim tokens.The freshly launched and long-awaited FRIEND token is trading at just a $25 million market cap following a launch that left many community members complaining.On May 3, the entire supply of FRIEND became claimable alongside Friend Tech’s v2 iteration. Friend Tech v2 also introduced a native decentralized exchange, BunnySwap, a revamped networking and social platform dubbed Money Club, and a new points system.However, with many users experiencing errors when attempting to claim their tokens, FRIEND being non-transferable except to trade on BunnySwap, and BunnySwap’s liquidity pool reportedly seeded with a single FRIEND token, the project has attracted widespread criticism.“They're likely going to seed with that 1 [FRIEND] and it'll be a madhouse from there,” tweeted 0xBreadguy, a DeFi developer. “Walled garden for degens away from any exchanges, who literally can't interact without having faked being a normal user first. It's on-chain anarchy for the foreseeable future.”“The Friend Tech claim is cooked because the app is generating the wrong proofs,” said 0x5f_eth of Ethos Network. “Doesn’t seem like everyone has the issue.”“For [Friend Tech co-founder] Racer’s final act, he’s enabled the ability for users to watch the price of $FRIEND free fall on the app without being able to load their wallet balance or claim their tokens,” said SplitCapital, a crypto analyst.Steep price declineAccording to CoinGecko, FRIEND crashed 67% over three hours to a low of $0.89 after debuting at $3.26. However, price data from DexScreener shows roughly twice as much chronological price action, including a brief spike to roughly $170 that reversed over 15 minutes.The token has since posted a sharp bounce from its low to change hands at $1.57, still equating to a meager market cap of $25.3 million.FRIEND/WETH price chart. Source: DexScreener.Luke Martin, the host of the Stacks Podcast, said they were stuck watching the value of their airdrop allocation fall from seven figures in value to five figures over two hours while unsuccessfully attempting to claim.Martin also flagged one of Friend Tech’s larger farmers unloading six figures worth of FRIEND immediately after claiming. “This was the largest sybil on Friend Tech dumping all his points in one clip,” Martin said.Fall from graceFriend Tech burst onto the burgeoning SocialFi scene in August 2023. The platform allows users to buy and trade “keys” allowing access to chatrooms associated with Twitter accounts.With prominent crypto analysts promising keyholders access to exclusive tips and alpha while also earning a 5% fee on key trades, Friend Tech rapidly emerged as a booming web3 platform.Friend Tech also earns a 5% fee on key sales, driving $1 million in daily revenue as volume peaked above $20 million in September, according to Dune Analytics. However, activity on the platform has since collapsed, with volume slumping to an all-time low below $60,000 on March 2.Data from Dune Analytics also shows daily users dipping below 1,000 in April, marking a pullback of more than 99% from its October high of nearly 74,000.

However, less than 1,500 users drove under $410,000 worth of trades daily during the final week of April as activity dried up again.According to 0xBreadGuy, Friend Tech will earn a 1.5% fee on Money Clubs, a 1.5% fee on Bunnyswap trades, and 5% on Friend Tech key swaps from its v2 iteration.Friend Tech creators will also continue to take a 5% fee on key swap, and share of referral fees.

Bitcoin Price (BTC) Rises Above $60K After Jobs Miss

Interest rates and the U.S. dollar have both risen strongly in 2024, particularly over the past few weeks, as market expectations of a slowing in economic growth and inflation have failed to pan out. Four months ago, a series of five or six 2024 interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve had been priced into forward markets, but, prior today, that was whittled down to one or two, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

BTC price targets with a Bitcoin short squeeze incoming


Bitcoin (BTC) drastically crashed this week, revisiting levels of over two months ago and affecting the cryptocurrency market‘s sentiment. In a dominating bearish market, traders started favoring short positions, which can lead to short squeezes in the following weeks.
Notably, long-position traders lost $400 million in liquidations during the crash, as fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) took over. This long squeeze rebalanced Bitcoin’s derivatives market, clearing most of the opened long positions.
As a result, the market’s open interest (OI) has weighted toward shorts, reaching record negative funding rates year-to-date. Finbold retrieved data from CoinGlass on March 3 showing BTC’s OI-weighted funding rate at its worst levels of 2024.


Essentially, negative funding rates mean Bitcoin short-sellers have to pay interest to long-position traders as they hold their positions. This is a mechanism created to keep the open interest balanced among longs and shorts even during high volatility events.

Bitcoin short squeeze and likely price targets
As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading below the key resistance level of $60,000 per coin. This level is important from both a psychological and technical analysis perspective, considering it has been strong support since March.
Therefore, breaking out from the $60,000 could lead to a sentiment shift to the ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO). Thus, triggering two potential short-squeeze events as massive collateral liquidity pools can become BTC price targets for market makers.
In particular, Bitcoin has over $1.72 billion worth of short-seller liquidations at $71,715. However, CoinGlass’s 1-month heatmap also shows significant liquidity at $67,420 and smaller pools around both key zones.
A short squeeze could reward Bitcoin traders with gains of 14% and 21% from the $59,200 at press time to the first and second liquidation levels, respectively.
BTC Liquidation Heatmap, 1-month chart. Source: CoinGlass
Despite the optimistic outlook for a potential short squeeze and over 14% gains, investors must remain cautious with Bitcoin trading. This is due to macroeconomic concerns related to the Fed’s interest rates and microeconomic concerns related to Bitcoin miners’ revenue drop, which affects network security.
In this context, investment experts from the renowned bank Standard Chartered foresee BTC reaching between $52,000 and $50,000 in the short term.
Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies, including BTC, have high volatility and are hard to forecast further performance.

BREAKING: US Non-Farm Employment Data Announced! What Was Bitcoin's Initial Reaction? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, approached $ 60,000 while trying to recover after the sharp declines it experienced.
While Bitcoin is currently at $59,000, some analysts warn investors that the decline may continue.


While various factors such as the decline in spot Bitcoin ETFs and the decrease in the possibility of a FED interest rate cut were effective in this decline, all eyes on BTC and altcoins today turned to the economic data from the USA.
The data announced on the first Friday of each month is closely followed by investors and stakeholders to understand the state of the economy.





The data disclosed is as follows:
Non-agricultural employment Data: Announced 175k – Expected 238k – Previous 303k


Unemployment data: Announced 3.9% – Expected 3.8% – Previous 3.8%
Bitcoin's reaction after the incoming data was as follows:






Effect of Non-Farm Employment and Unemployment Data on Price!
Non-agricultural employment data coming in above expectations is considered a signal of economic recovery in that country and has a positive impact on the currency.
Changes in the labor market have a significant impact on the FED's monetary policy. The FED, which thinks that the labor market should cool down in addition to the decrease in inflation, follows employment data closely.
If the announced data exceeds expectations, we can see that DXY (dollar index) rises and Bitcoin retreats slightly. If it comes below expectations, it may cause us to see a retreat in DXY.

The increase in the unemployment rate may cause us to see a sharp retreat in DXY. This will also be positive for Bitcoin.
In both possibilities, volatility will be high during the minutes when the data is announced.

MoonPay Enables Crypto Purchases via PayPal


							

MoonPay partners with PayPal to facilitate crypto transactions for U.S. users.



Users can buy cryptocurrencies through MoonPay using PayPal accounts.



PayPal provides an added layer of security.




MoonPay has taken a positive step in its cryptocurrency services, partnering with PayPal to facilitate crypto-fiat transactions for U.S. residents. With this integration, US-based users of the FinTech app can purchase cryptocurrency through PayPal.



MoonPay disclosed this news on its X account, saying, “Today, we’re thrilled to announce a game-changing integration: MoonPay has partnered with @PayPal to offer seamless fiat-to-crypto transactions for users in the U.S.!”



In a separate post on its website, MoonPay stated that this collaboration will allow U.S. customers to buy digital assets using their existing PayPal accounts. In addition, they can automatically initiate direct bank withdrawals or use a debit card, making the transaction process simpler.



Moreover, PayPal provides an added layer of security, meaning users can conduct cryptocurrency transactions without sharing complete financial information.



Ivan Soto-Wright, co-founder and CEO of MoonPay, commented on this development, noting that “PayPal has always been at the forefront of revolutionizing commerce globally.” 



Soto-Wright highlighted that users are exploring alternative “financial systems.” Hence, this partnership reflects the company’s goal of offering consumers access to several options, including cryptocurrency. 









He added, “By integrating PayPal, we are enabling consumers to transact with crypto in an already familiar environment and significantly lower the barrier to entry for new users.” In essence, this partnership represents a move to streamline cryptocurrency transactions and make them more accessible to a broader audience of users.



Through this integration, PayPal’s extensive user base, exceeding 426 million globally, gains access to crypto purchases. On the other hand, MoonPay, which offers crypto-based services to an established user base of over 15 million, stands to benefit from the expanded reach facilitated by PayPal’s platform.



Furthermore, this initiative is strategic for both entities as it enables PayPal to further diversify its offerings and explore new avenues within the digital asset sector. Simultaneously, it strengthens MoonPay’s position as a leading provider of accessible crypto-purchasing solutions, particularly within the U.S. market.

In the letter addressed to Judge Sarah Netburn, Ripple argued that the SEC has failed to show that Andrea Fox’s declaration is “summary evidence rather than expert testimony or that it was under the court’s scheduling order.” In line with this, they requested that her testimony be struck out. 

Ripple initially raised this motion in opposition to the SEC’s motion for remedies and entry of final judgment. They argued that the SEC erred in relying on Fox’s testimony, as she was never disclosed as a fact or expert witness and was not deposed during the initial discovery or supplemental remedies discovery.
In reply to Ripple’s initial motion, the SEC tried to paint Fox as a summary witness rather than an expert witness, which Ripple had classified her testimony as. The Commission argued that “Ripple incorrectly claims this declaration constitutes expert testimony.” It further stated that this wasn’t the case, claiming that Fox’s declaration was a “standard summary evidence permissible” under the law. 
This was what made Ripple pivot in its latest court filing. It argued that even if Fox was a summary witness (and not an expert witness, as believed), the SEC hasn’t done enough to prove this. The crypto firm noted that the Commission has also failed to explain why Fox’s declaration highlighted her qualification as an accountant if they weren’t trying to paint her as an expert witness. 
Usually, a witness’s qualification would only matter if the witness in question was meant to give expert testimony. As such, although the SEC argues that Fox isn’t, everything points to her being an expert rather than a summary witness. 
Another Argument On Why Fox Is An Expert Witness
In its reply, the SEC claimed that Fox was a summary witness because her declaration only applied “basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records.” However, Ripple refuted this argument, noting that Fox’s actions suggested she was acting as an expert witness. They stated how the accountant used her specialized knowledge to analyze not only Ripple’s records but also third-party evidence and expert reports. 

She then used her analysis to draw inferences and conclusions about the documents she reviewed. Ripple also claimed that she calculated the disgorgement, prejudgement interest, and discount amounts based on her analysis. Basically, the crypto firm was hinting at the fact that the SEC stipulated its proposed fine of almost $2 billion based on Fox’s judgment.
Ripple also alluded to how the SEC had cited one of Fox’s inferences in its remedies memorandum. According to the crypto firm, “a layperson could not “infer” what entries “appear to” mean by doing basic math.”

Turbos Finance pioneers new liquidity strategies for Sui


Turbos Finance, a decentralized exchange (DEX), has unveiled two market-first liquidity strategies within the Sui (SUI) ecosystem, according to the information shared with Finbold on May 2.
The new strategies aim to revolutionize automated liquidity management and simplify liquidity provision.
Turbos Finance’s liquidity strategies
The first strategy is a network-centric automated liquidity management vault for CLMM positions on the Turbos DEX within the Sui network. 


The second is an innovative Auto-swap capability combined with Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategies meant to simplify liquidity provision.
With these automated rebalance vaults, liquidity providers (LPs) can increase their returns with less effort. 
On the other hand, retail investors and professional strategy managers will also be able to optimize their strategies and LP yield.
The Isolated Position Model
Turbos’ key innovations in automated rebalance vaults include the Isolated Position Model (IPM).
Different from the traditional share pool model, IPM offers individual fund management for LPs, utilizing Sui’s exceptional gas efficiency and scalability and setting a new decentralized finance (DeFi) benchmark for asset management.
Additionally, the introduction of Auto-compound Fee and Rewards will make it easier to form LP pairs by allowing single-token deposits for automatic pairing. 
This new feature is set to attract more users, improve Total Value Locked (TVL), increase network activity, and introduce systematic investment via DCA LP functionalities.
To further incentivize and reward active users, Turbos will introduce a referral program offering fee waivers.
New Sui data models
Ted Shao, Co-founder of Turbos Finance, commented on the partnership, stating:

“Our rebalance vault leverages the unique capabilities of Sui to transform user interaction with DeFi. Users precisely manage their assets individually, adapting to market shifts with real-time, high-frequency adjustments. Our vault simplifies asset management through rebalancing and compounding to maximize returns with minimal effort.”

Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-founder and Chief Product Officer (CPO) at Mysten Labs, the investors in Turbos Finance, echoed Shao’s sentiment, expressing excitement about the innovative digital asset management strategies introduced.
Abiodun emphasized the exciting opportunities provided by new data models, as well as the exceptional gas efficiency and scalable architecture of the Sui platform.
The new liquidity strategies will be implemented on May 3, with ongoing updates and optimizations planned to enhance efficiency and user experience. 
The launch of DCA strategies is scheduled for Q3.

BTC is the Best Crypto Network; It’s Not Just the Best Crypto Asset - Michael Saylor | Cryptopolitan

Yesterday at Microstrategy World: Bitcoin for corporations, Michael Saylor had multiple strong positive remarks on Bitcoin and its network. Saylor, categorically said Bitcoin is the best Cryptocurrency Network and not just the best crypto asset. Simply put, there is no second best to Bitcoin. His words.Video Courtesy of MicroStrategy. According to Michael Saylor, Bitcoin is the best treasury asset since it is able to provide accretion, unlike the US dollar which creates dilution. Bitcoin, according to MicroStrategy’s Executive Chairman, provides the most ideal alternative investment, which has absolutely no correlation to state-owned currencies and no affiliations to corporations. The man certainly holds Bitcoin in high regard, claiming that Bitcoin is the best bank and path to peace and prosperity. He does not see Bitcoin as a single product, instead, Bitcoin is a full-fledged ecosystem of products, securities, companies, derivatives, and even professions. In his presentation, he mentioned there are up to 220 million Bitcoin holders globally and the robust network certainly provides the most secure crypto network. Currently there are approximately 420 million crypto users today. According to Michael Saylor, all Altcoins are facing major regulatory issues, competing against one another, attempting to tread new waters, and getting hacked among others. These challenges, eventually could blow up and all the liquidity from these ecosystems would flow right into Bitcoin, why? -you guessed it, the best crypto network with 100% acceptance. Michael Saylor says Bitcoin is the most widely bought investment asset in the world and he makes incredibly good points to back this case. Considering Bitcoin is held by over 400 million users worldwide, it makes it one of the most popular assets, and all holders want the same thing, for BTC price to do well on the markets. Bitcoin’s Institutional Adoption and the Future – Michael Saylor“There’s no more powerful idea than the digital transformation of capital… No force on earth can stop an idea whose time has come. This is an idea. Its time has come. It’s unstoppable. And so I’m going to end with the observation that Bitcoin is the best. The best what? The best.”The MicroStrategy Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor.According to him the digital transformation of capital can improve several aspects of our life. In fact, he mentions that digital transformation, although isn’t a solution to all world problems, it is indeed a solution to half of the problems in the world. In his closing remarks, Saylor urged attendees to Study, Buy, Hold, Build on, Advocate for, Defend, and Enjoy Bitcoin.

The Rise of DeFi Lending: How ZeroLend is Transforming the space



                    

If you’ve ever gone through the process of applying for a loan through traditional banking, you know it can be quite cumbersome. Traditionally, securing a loan meant dealing with a maze of paperwork, credit checks, and lengthy approval procedures. However, DeFi lending changes this narrative entirely. Now, borrowers can utilize their crypto assets as collateral, instantly accessing funds through smart contracts seamlessly integrated into blockchain networks. This is the reality of DeFi lending, a sector that is witnessing rapid growth, with an astonishing $24.62 billion locked in smart contracts.



Amidst the booming DeFi lending market, ZeroLend stands out with its unique features. Let’s delve into how this platform is revolutionizing the way you can securely and smoothly avail credit.

With an estimated 15-17% of the total supply allocated for community airdrops, ZeroLend demonstrates its commitment to inclusivity and community engagement.



Leading the DeFi Revolution



ZeroLend’s exponential growth positions it as a formidable contender in the lending space, rapidly ascending the ranks to become one of the top 10 lending protocols alongside industry stalwarts like Aave, Compound, and Spark. With a remarkable $200 million growth in Total Value Locked (TVL) in 2024, ZeroLend sets its sights on revolutionizing DeFi lending and simplifying it for the retail audience.




ZeroLend’s Innovations in DeFi Lending



Curve-like Tokenomics

Immutable (IMX) Faces Token Unlock, Will the Market Absorb Potential Selling? | Cryptopolitan

Tokens have been locked up for years for many high-profile projects. To protect investors and prove transparency, many projects store some of those tokens in a preset smart contract, to be unlocked at a certain date. Some of the most significant unlocking programs belonged to Ripple, where each month the market waited to see if the new unlocked batch would be sold. A new token unlock is coming up this week for Immutable (IMX), one of the high-profile L2 networks. Immutable will increase its free float with up to 2%, after a new batch of tokens gets unlocked on May 6.As of May 2024, Immutable has unlocked more than 65.51% of all locked tokens. The current unlock is valued at $1.57M, and represents 1.93% of the free float. From this moment onward, the unlocks will accelerate even more, increasing the supply of IMX. The market trades around 2.46% of the available supply, which may put pressure on the IMX market price.IMX Tokens Hold Relatively Low LiquidityDays before the unlock, IMX traded at $2.21, while trading volumes were around $70M in 24 hours. But this activity comes with thin availability of buyers. The 2% slippage liquidity for IMX is just around $152K, just a fraction of the size of the upcoming token unlock. IMX is sinking from its recent short-term peak above $3.60, but remains a bit more active after several years of stagnation. The most new IMX comes from rewards for ecosystem development. IMX is also eligible for staking programs, as well as special quests. The Immutable community can now receive daily Gem rewards for bridging IMX tokens. Over time, IMX holders will receive more IMX into their balance, especially for swapping and bridging quests. The Immutable project has a long-term view of developing its ecosystem. Still, in the coming months, there will be more IMX available, and it will either be used in incentivized programs, or deflate the market in case of direct selling. Immutable Brings Gems Holding ProgramImmutable offers incentives to hold onto IMX tokens and receive future rewards. Currently, the daily quests offered require users to just hold a balance of at least 20 IMX and collect three Gems daily. The more Gems accrued, the more future rewards and bonuses will come to the player. Gems will then serve to put the player in a higher tier for future IMX airdrops or additional rewards, access or exclusive deals. With this move, IMX has turned into a point-farming protocol, aiming to protect its main token from selling. Immutable Aims to Jump-Start Web3 RecoveryImmutable has grown a significant ecosystem of games, including high-profile projects like Illuvium, or upcoming ones like Wagmi Game. But players may need a bit more to regain their enthusiasm for Web3 gaming. To that goal, Immutable brings incentives with a value of $50M to boost participation in its portfolio of games. Part of the rewards will also go to the holders of collectibles and NFT. Immutable has been a driver of NFT creation and trading, targeting high-profile projects as a partner.More High-Profile Token Unlocks Coming in the Next MonthIn the next month, several projects will expand their free float. Token unlocks are coming from Arbitrum (ARB), with a value of nearly $9M. ApeCoin (APE) will inject $8.89M worth of tokens. Optimism (OP) will also grow its circulation with an additional 1.15%, after spending years as a tokenless project.A more significant unlock is expected from Sui Foundation (SUI), which will release around 20% of its supply. The new tokens are valued at $189M based on current market prices. Sui is one of the projects with a complex program of locked tokens. On May 31, additional data show several tiers of token owners will have their assets unlocked. Nearly 1B SUI tokens will potentially enter the market from that date onward. In the long term, some of the remaining SUI tokens will remain locked until after 2030. Over the years, Sui will also accelerate the unlocking of vaults, in a series of events of both gradual increases and “cliff unlocks” that will inflate the supply more significantly.

Tap Into the Most Lucrative ETH to USDT Exchange with the Lowest Fees Today



                    

Swapping ETH to USDT has become a staple transaction in cryptocurrency, offering swift and strategic benefits for savvy investors and active traders. These enthusiasts often capitalize on this famous trading pair, emphasizing the importance of securing a profitable exchange rate and low-to-zero transaction fees. Today, we invite you to explore CrowdSwap, a standout platform that promises enhanced financial opportunities and prioritizes your trading efficiency. Discover why CrowdSwap could be your go-to choice for making the most of your cryptocurrency transactions.



Tether, also called USDT, is a stablecoin directly pegged to the US dollar, providing a buffer against the often severe price movements every day in cryptocurrencies such as ETH. In the frequently turbulent realm of cryptocurrency trading, stablecoins such as Tether play a crucial role. USDT emerged as the foremost stablecoin, enjoying significant trading volume and widespread recognition. Amidst the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency commerce spaces, Tether, valued in the billions, presents itself as a steadfast and reliable option. To shield their profits and mitigate potential losses, traders and investors frequently opt to convert their assets into USDT, underscoring its esteemed position within the trading community.




In contrast, Ethereum (ETH) ranks just below Bitcoin in terms of commerce funding and general popularity. Its versatility and extensive range of applications have garnered significant esteem within the cryptocurrency community, prompting numerous individuals to either buy or exchange their tokens for ETH. ETH holds value for investment and trading purposes, and its diverse advantages within the Ethereum ecosystem. However, as previously noted, there are instances where investors may find it prudent to convert their ETH holdings into more stable assets like USDT.



Diving deep into CrowdSwap’s Ethereum to Tether exchange



Developed in Germany in 2020, this decentralized platform is dedicated to cryptocurrency trading and generating passive income. CrowdSwap is expertly crafted for quick and easy cross-chain swaps, requiring only a few clicks for operation. Users can seamlessly exchange tokens without the hassle of managing wallets or navigating complex network settings.

All transaction fees are presented upfront, with absolutely no hidden costs.



The exchange’s trade tracking system further enhances its user-friendliness, allowing you to effortlessly track transaction status, review all your activities, and employ advanced filtering options not commonly available on other exchanges.




Lightning-fast cross-chain substitutes



With CrowdSwap, cross-chain transactions and fast, secure substitution are made possible, and token movement between several blockchain networks is easy. Take advantage of unrestricted bridging, trading, and infinite substitution of any token between chains.



Limit orders across chains



You can improve your commerce approach and exclude potential risks using CrowdSwap’s limit orders system. With it, you can set limit orders across various blockchains, altogether avoiding the once-necessary bridge between chain structures, thus reducing the risk of exposure. The feature allows users to determine the exact amount of coins and the value they want to purchase or trade them. Then, these orders are put on hold until the broader market sentiment meets the user’s wants, detailed in the limit order. By leveraging this functionality, you can entirely protect your investments or sidestep commerce volatility.



How CrowdSwap revolutionized the Ethereum to Tether landscape



As you may have noticed, CrowdSwap offers a highly efficient and cost-effective solution for exchanging Ethereum (ETH) for Tether (USDT). By leveraging advanced technology to minimize transaction fees and optimize trading routes, this promising company ensures a seamless exchange experience and maximizes user value. This platform is ideal for individuals who manage their cryptocurrency investments smartly, providing a reliable tool for those seeking to transition between ETH and USDT with minimal cost and maximum efficiency.



CrowdSwap is actively taking its place as the spearheader of the current cryptocurrency community. With the launch of the first decentralized ETF, it quickly set itself apart from the competition. On top of that, the variety of decentralized and general swap infrastructures it offers to its clients is immensely comprehensive and deserves praise.




The ETF is a promising new venture within the larger cryptocurrency market. We suggest all our readers keep a close eye on this platform’s future innovations and expansions, as it might spell a lucrative opportunity in the coming years.



CrowdSwap demonstrates a commendable approach to cryptocurrency exchanges. However, to truly appreciate the innovation and efficiency it brings to the table, visit the platform directly, explore its services, and experience the benefits yourself.

Arweave (AR) Rallies on New Futures Market Launch, Network Marks Transaction Record | Cryptopolitan

Arweave (AR) recovered strongly to $35, remaining close to its weekly peak. Arweave is part of the new batch of projects that started trading in 2021, and is yet to recover the all-time high of above $80 achieved during the 2021-2022 bull market.AR traded at $35.07 with volumes close to $200M in 24 hours and $355K in liquidity for 2% slippage. AR remains in the green on the weekly chart, as the project entered the top 50 of coins based on market capitalization. AR is also an outlier among tokens, for having 99% of its supply in circulation, with no locked coins or vaults. Additionally, around 8% of all tokens are actively traded in a 24-hour period. AR retains mid-range liquidity in its most active trading pairs on Binance.The immediate reason for the AR rally was a recent listing on the Coinbase futures market, along with Hedera and Theta Network. The full effect of futures trading is yet to be seen, as the new markets will open from May 9.Arweave Marks Transaction Peak in AprilThe Arweave ecosystem aims to build the decentralized ledger for data storage and retrieval. Arweave protocol has been tested for years now, and has proven robust as a tool for permanent data storage. A distributed system aims to disrupt existing cloud solutions, with the potential to create truly neutral web apps and storage that does not expire due to time constraints. Increased usage also translates into demand for AR tokens, as they are the main currency to pay for storage. Over the past few months, Arweave noted increased data inflows and transactions on its specialized blockchain.Arweave is now in the most active stage of building up its ecosystem and social media community. An expanding token is only helping to retain new supporters. The Arweave community have picked the Weavers nickname. Arweave is now trying to retain users by also offering gamified bounties. Arweave Moves to Decentralized ComputingArweave is also targeting developers directly, with the potential to build decentralized applications. The platform has carried distributed data solutions for a total of six years, while expanding beyond storage and into distributed computing. With the new addition of AO Computer, Arweave turns similar to projects like the Internet Computer.The Arweave services are available for end users, but also as enterprise solutions. Distributed data and computation was also implemented by other blockchain projects, showing that Arweave is compatible with all types of data needs.On Arweave’s distributed storage, the platform brings a more accessible way of interacting with blockchain records. Over the years, blockchains become too large and only dedicated entities try to hold the entire history. Arweave aims to prevent that data overload, by incentivizing distributed storage and retrieval of the blockchain history.Arweave also branched into the AO Computer project, which positions itself as a hub for developers. In general, Arweave aims to add new activities and branches, becoming a multi-product hub. Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are also one of the targets for Arweave. In the coming months, Arweave may also add faster forms of swapping and DeFi capabilities. But the key project remains the AO computer, which will aim to transfer fast messages for decentralized Internet services. AO Computer is still in the testnet stage, but Arweave hopes to repeat the success of its decentralized data network. In the coming months, the AO evolution from test net to official launch may continue to drive attention for Arweave, as well as the AR token. The launch of the AO test net was among the big events for Arweave, which caused a 40% token rally in February. Arweave Uses Data-Based Mining ProtocolArweave uses a process of mining, where each node has to prove they have stored as much data as possible. The Arweave protocol checks randomly for a selected piece of data. Miners receive rewards if they have that data in storage and available for retrieval. Mining with proof of data storage is possible even for consumer-grade electronics. There are also other roles for securing the blockchain, such as observer nodes. All network participants will receive incentive IO tokens for securing the project’s distributed services.

Kraken’s Indices Unit Claims 50% of Crypto Benchmarking Market - DailyCoin


        
One of Kraken’s crypto units has achieved a key milestone.



The unit is a beneficiary of the spot Bitcoin ETF boom in the U.S.



The unit now controls a significant share of the crypto benchmarking market.
Kraken’s indices provider CF Benchmarks has tapped the spot Bitcoin ETF boom to control a significant share of the crypto benchmarking market, the company said Friday.Founded in 2017 and acquired by Kraken in 2019, CF Benchmarks has established itself as a leading digital asset index provider authorized by the UK’s FCA. The company has partnerships with notable industry heavyweights, including Nomura, Hashdex, and Custodia.CF Benchmarks Dominates Crypto BenchmarkingIn a Bloomberg report dated May 3, CF Benchmarks claimed that it represented “roughly half the crypto benchmarking market” following this year’s boom in U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
The company said it provides reference data for about $24 billion in cryptocurrency ETFs, mostly the new fleet of Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin funds, including BlackRock’s $15 billion IBIT. CF Benchmarks licenses its benchmarks to these funds in exchange for fees that rise in tandem with assets under management (AUM).Per the report, the company anticipated $5 billion of assets this year for the U.S. Bitcoin ETFs that use its indices but the amount has exceeded this projection by four times, providing more opportunities for CF Benchmarks.Looking ahead, CF Benchmarks is keen on tapping the new Hong Kong crypto ETF market.
“South Korea is a market where ETFs have become the wrapper of choice for long-term savings,” CF Benchmarks CEO Sui Chung stated. “It is also a market where digital assets have gained a high degree of adoption.”Besides forecasting as much as $1 billion in AUM for the Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ether funds, Chung sees crypto ETFs reaching Israel and South Korea next.  Read about BTCC’s massive crypto trading competition:BTCC Sets 10M USDT Rewards for Its World Trading ContestStay updated on Binance’s collaboration with India to nab a multimillion-dollar scam:Binance Collaborates with Indian Authorities to Nab $10M Scam

New Solana Memecoin Homo Pepe (HOMPEPE) to Skyrocket 8,000% and Take On Shiba Inu and Bonk



                    

Homo Pepe (HOMPEPE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK).



Homo Pepe (HOMPEPE), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK).




Early investors in SHIB and BONK made astronomical returns, and Homo Pepe presents a similar opportunity.



Homo Pepe has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 5,300% in the coming two days, and Homo Pepe could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Homo Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Homo Pepe on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – HmnxTLpi2QYp9LCB1p8yFgR3X5xqVmE4eAnWU4xMYGe1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, BONK and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMPEPE.

On May 1, an anonymous wallet executed a major transaction on the Robinhood exchange, acquiring 1.75 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens, valued at approximately $40 million.
The data from Whale Alert shows that this substantial acquisition involved two separate transfers, each moving 875 billion SHIB in under a minute.




The massive transactions occurred from Robinhood to the wallet address ‘0x73AF3bcf944a6559933396c1577B257e2054D935. 
According to Etherscan data, this wallet has previously moved SHIB to and from Robinhood as well. Over the past month, this address has engaged significantly in the SHIB market with high-volume transactions. 
Notably, it transferred 3 trillion SHIB into Robinhood on April 24, showcasing a pattern of regular inflows and outflows with the platform. This behavior underscores its considerable influence in the market, with the wallet currently holding over 5.88 trillion SHIB, valued at approximately $128 million.
Market impact and predictions
Professional crypto trader Ali Martinez mentioned in a post on X (formerly Twitter) recently that Shiba Inu appears to be forming a bull flag on its daily chart. A bull flag is a bullish pattern, suggesting that the crypto asset is poised for further upward movement. Anticipating this, the crypto analyst revealed that he is placing buy orders around $0.000018343, aiming for a bullish breakout that could propel Shiba Inu’s price to $0.000072323.

Despite the market’s recent dips, the trading volume and wallet activities suggest continuous interest in Shiba Inu tokens, highlighting the volatile yet intriguing nature of cryptocurrency investments. 
According to data from Coinmarketcap, the Shiba Inu daily trading volume has risen approximately 40%. This surge is driven mostly by the Binance crypto exchange, whose Japanese arm announced a number of sought-after trading pairs, including SHIB.

As of press time, Shiba Inu was changing hands at a price of $0.00002363, recording an increase of 3.18% in the last 24 hours. The current market activity surrounding Shiba Inu reflects a vibrant and dynamic market. Observations and analyses provided by market experts suggest a bullish outlook for SHIB, making it a noteworthy consideration for investors looking for exposure in the cryptocurrency space.
As the market continues to evolve, it will be crucial for investors and analysts alike to stay informed of such trends and movements to optimize their strategies in the ever-changing landscape of digital assets.

Bitcoin Billionaire Arthur Hayes Predicts Market Bottom Is In, 'Slow Grind Higher' - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsWhen the Bitcoin price tanks, traders tend to take cover and look for signs that the market has reached bottom and will reverse its trajectory.To that end, Bitcoin billionaire and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes has some cautious optimism to share. "While I don’t expect crypto to fully realize the recent U.S. monetary announcements’ inflationary nature immediately," he wrote in a blog post, "I expect prices to bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher."In other words, he thinks that the worst is over—for now.Earlier this week, Bitcoin crashed below $57,000 ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting. But when Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that interest rates would again remain unchanged—which many investors were expecting—prices traded sideways.At the time of writing, Bitcoin has reclaimed $61,000 for the first time since the end of April, having gained 4.6% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.While Hayes predicts that the bottom is in for Bitcoin, his strategy does not include adding to his BTC bags."I certainly won’t be babysitting Bitcoin when I could be two-stepping," he wrote, adding that, "The recent intense puke out provides an excellent opportunity to unstake my USDe and spend synthetic dollars on high beta shitcoins. I’m buying Solana and doggie coins for momentum trading positions."The good news, he said, is that recent developments at the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve, and the recent bailout of Republic First Bank are all indicators that dollar liquidity will start to increase. It was only just a month ago—ahead of the most recent Bitcoin halving—that Hayes was bearish on prices because of dwindling dollar liquidity.One of the main macroeconomic indicators he highlight was the Federal Reserve preparing to borrow more money between now and the end of June—approximately $41 billion than previously announced in January."That’s no bueno if you are a holder of Treasuries," Hayes explained, saying that this will bump up the supply of Treasury bonds. That, he said, will likely increase long-term bond rates."Yellen’s response to that will be some form of yield curve control," he wrote in the blog post, "and that’s when Bitcoin begins its ascent for realz to $1 million."Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Why This Crypto Bull Run Might Not Live Up To The Past: Analyst


                            In a detailed analysis shared with his 788,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), renowned analyst Pentoshi has forecasted a more restrained outlook for the current crypto bull run, suggesting that it may not mirror the explosive growth seen in previous cycles. His insights provide a deep dive into the underlying factors that could temper the market’s performance.
Why Crypto Investors Have To Expect Diminishing Returns
Pentoshi began his analysis by stating, “This cycle should have the largest diminishing returns of any cycle,” attributing this prediction to several key market conditions. Primarily, he noted that the base market capitalization for cryptocurrencies has increased significantly in each successive cycle, setting a higher starting point that makes further exponential growth increasingly challenging.
“Each cycle has set a floor about 10x the previous lows in terms of market cap,” Pentoshi explained. He provided a historical context, recounting that when he entered the crypto market in 2017, the market cap for altcoins was only around $12-15 billion, a figure that ballooned to over $1 trillion during peak periods. He argued, “That growth isn’t repeatable,” pointing out that the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which was then nascent, played a significant role in driving previous cycles’ exceptional returns.

Another significant factor Pentoshi highlighted is the dramatic increase in the number of altcoins and the corresponding market dilution. “Today, however, there are a lot more alts, and a lot more dilution,” he remarked, indicating that the proliferation of new tokens spreads investment thinner across the market, reducing the potential for individual tokens to achieve substantial price increases.
Pentoshi also touched upon the demographic shifts in crypto ownership. He contrasted the early days of crypto adoption, when approximately 2% of Americans were involved in the market, to the present, where over 25% of Americans have some form of crypto investment. “It just requires more capital to move the markets, and there will continue to be a lot more alts, spreading it out further,” he noted, emphasizing the logistical and financial challenges of replicating past growth rates in a much more saturated market.
An often-overlooked aspect of market dynamics, according to Pentoshi, is the role of token liquidity and its impact on price stability. He detailed that recently, tokens amounting to about $250 million were unlocked daily, though not necessarily sold. “Assuming they all got sold, that is the inflows you’d need just to keep prices stable for 24 hours,” he explained, highlighting the delicate balance required to maintain current market levels, let alone drive prices upward.

Looking forward, Pentoshi was conservative in his expectations for the Total3 index, which tracks the top 125 altcoins (excludes Bitcoin and Ethereum). He estimated, “My best guess is that this cycle we don’t see Total 3 go 2x past the 21′ cycle ATH. So 2.2T max for Total3.” This projection underscores his broader thesis that while the market continues to offer daily opportunities, the era of “easy, outsized gains” might be behind us.
Pentoshi concluded his analysis with advice for investors, suggesting a more cautious approach to market participation. “If you believe the cycle is 50% over, you should be taking out more than you are putting in and building up some cash and buying other assets with lower risk in the meantime,” he advised, stressing the importance of securing gains and diversifying holdings to mitigate risk.
Reflecting on the psychological aspects of investing, he added, “Most people never really learn. Because if you can’t control your greed, and defeat it, you are destined to give back your gains repeatedly.” His parting words were a reminder of the cyclical and often predatory nature of financial markets, urging investors to secure profits and protect themselves from foreseeable downturns.
At press time, TOTAL3 stood at $635.565 billion, which is still more than -43 % below the last cycle high.

Bitcoin Headed For A 'W-Shaped Reversal,' Says Crypto Expert, Who Sees Altseason 'Around The Corner' - Benzinga

Pseudonymous researcher Alex Wacy predicts that Bitcoin BTC/USD has reached its bottom at $52,000, sparking discussions on the cryptocurrency's future.What Happened: In a recent analysis shared on May 2, Wacy observed the crypto community’s focus on the $52,000 level for Bitcoin. He noted increased buyer interest at this level and suggested that every price rise is being viewed as a short entry to $52,000."Everyone is eyeing $52,000, but it’s not feasible to dump the price up just so everyone can buy in," Wacy writes.In an ideal scenario, where Bitcoin’s price would rise to $62,000, retract to just below $56,500, and then rapidly pump to over $70,000, it would mark the start of an altseason. If Wacy’s analysis proves accurate, it could signal a significant shift in the crypto market.Drawing parallels to previous situations when Bitcoin was at $17,000 and $28,000, Wacy predicted a similar outcome. He also suggested that buying altcoins at current levels is not a mistake, indicating an attractive risk-reward ratio for investors looking to diversify their crypto portfolios.Also Read: Is Bitcoin’s Fall Over? Top Crypto Analyst Says ‘Altcoins Are Going To Take Over Until…’Why It Matters: If Wacy’s analysis proves accurate, it could signal a significant shift in the crypto market. The potential W-shaped reversal pattern and the start of an altseason would be a welcome development for investors who have weathered the recent market turbulence.Wacy emphasized the importance of buying Bitcoin in parts rather than trying to catch the bottom, citing personal experience as a lesson. In another tweet, Wacy writes, "It doesn’t matter if it’s $58,000, $52,000, or $43,000, the alt season is just around the corner and top alts that retail understands and generates interest will be pumped."While the accuracy of Wacy’s predictions remains to be seen, his analysis provides a compelling perspective on the potential direction of the crypto market and the opportunities that may arise for both Bitcoin and altcoins.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: What The FOMC Meeting Means For Bitcoin’s Next MoveImage:

How can you own a genuine Banksy? The answer’s on the blockchain - CoinJournal



                    

                    10101.art, a ground-breaking art-tech platform, celebrated its official launch in Dubai’s Monada Art gallery this week.
Bringing the power of the distributed ledger to the global art market, 10101.art leverages blockchain technology to make iconic works by Banksy, Warhol, Picasso, Dali, and others available for collective ownership.
Alina Krot, CEO of 10101.art, sat down to discuss the platform’s launch with Philip Hoey, Director of CoinJournal.

Philip Hoey: Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with CoinJournal, Alina. Let’s kick off with a quick overview of your platform – can you describe the journey that led you and your team to launch 10101.art?
Alina Krot: My journey to the art world was quite long. Even though art has always been my passion, my first career choice was finance. I used to work with high-risk assets and large investment lending projects in a bank before getting into the startup scene. 5 years later I realized that the big corporate world is not for me. In 2019, I got involved in WEB 3. This choice allowed me to dive into the blockchain field and work on several projects, gaining valuable experience.
Eventually, I’d grown to take a product management role. All that experience made me realize that basically any traditional sphere can be made more accessible with blockchain.
The puzzle of financial expertise and art appreciation came together when I met Iryna, founder of 10101.art. I realized that the art market can actually become more inclusive with the power of blockchain. Moreover, I knew I could really contribute to that.
PH: What first sparked your interest in combining physical art with blockchain technology?
AK: I guess it was the realization of the absolute benefits blockchain is able to bring to the art industry. And by that I mean collective ownership and democratization of the art market itself. For a long time art ownership was a privilege of the richer people. Blockchain and collective ownership is making this market accessible for everyone. 
Every year more and more industries, such as real estate, healthcare, finance, etc. have already realized the benefits of blockchain implementation, so I’m pretty sure that a more widespread adoption will bring new disruptive innovations in numerous fields.
PH: NFT enthusiasts will be very familiar with investing in digital assets, but 10101.art is pioneering the use of NFTs for physical artworks. Given that many of these artworks are considered masterpieces and will almost certainly appreciate in value, it seems like this might offer collectors a less risky approach to engaging with art. Would you agree with that?
AK: Absolutely, owning a piece of art on 10101.art is definitely less risky, especially for those familiar with the NFT space. 
First, there are liquidity issues. Traditionally, art can be tough to sell quickly, especially for collectors with little to no experience. With collective ownership through NFTs, individuals are able to trade them on a secondary market.
Another huge advantage is affordability. 10101.art allows people to buy a smaller piece of a valuable artwork. This makes masterpiece ownership much more reachable compared to needing to buy the whole thing at auctions.
There’s also the transparency factor. Blockchain technology provides a clear record of ownership and the artwork’s history, which can be reassuring.

PH: In the past there have been other platforms that have used special purpose vehicles to enable fractional ownership of famous artworks, but leveraging the power of the blockchain seems like a more efficient process than forming a new SPV every time a new artwork is offered for sale. Would you say physical NFTs are the future of fractional ownership in the art world? 
AK: There’s no doubt that traditional collective ownership models, reliant on special purpose vehicles (SPVs), can be inefficient. The need to establish a new SPV for each artwork creates significant administrative burdens. In this regard, physical NFTs, leveraging the power of blockchain technology, offer a compelling alternative.
The efficiency gains associated with NFTs are undeniable. By eliminating the requirement for bespoke SPVs, co-ownership becomes streamlined. Additionally, the inherent transparency and security of blockchain facilitates seamless transactions and clear ownership tracking.
Furthermore, physical NFTs democratize access to the art world. By tokenizing high-value artworks, individuals who might not possess the resources to acquire a masterpiece outright can still participate in the art market.
PH: Which blockchain does 10101.art use?
AK: Currently our platform operates on Ethereum blockchain. But we also plan to launch some collections using other new EVM-compatible blockchains in the near future.
PH: Can you explain the tokenization process?
AK: Of course. The tokenization process on 10101.art is divided into four major stages.
The process begins with a dedicated team scouring valuable collections, auction houses, and galleries. Authenticity is paramount, so each piece undergoes careful examination before being considered.
Once an artwork is selected, our development team scans and uploads it for safekeeping on a secure, decentralized system. This ensures the digital record remains tamper-proof and readily accessible. Here’s where the magic of blockchain comes in: using smart contracts, we split ownership of an artwork into tokens. These contracts clearly define the total number of tokens available and their initial value, providing complete transparency. All ownership rights over a particular painting are specified in the documents defining co-ownership, published on our website.
Eventually, individuals become co-owners of a renowned artwork. By purchasing a token, they don’t just acquire a digital image. They gain a verifiable stake in the physical piece itself, stored at our partner gallery, Monada Art.

PH: How many fragments is each individual artwork divided into, and is there a limit to how many tokens an individual art collector can buy for that artwork?
AK: The amount of fragments depends on the artwork itself. For example, so far there are 1500 pieces of Banksy’s “Turf War” and 1200 of Warhol’s “Campbell’s Soup Cans” in total available on 10101.art. However, there’s no actual limit.
PH: Do 10101.art users use crypto to buy these artworks, or can they also use fiat?
AK: Our team is currently working on that matter. So, the only thing I can say is stay tuned for the updates on our social media! We’ll announce the start of fiat payments soon.
PH: If an enthusiast wants to buy a whole artwork on 10101.art is that possible?
AK: It is possible, although it’s an individual procedure. If you’re interested in buying a whole artwork, feel free to contact us and we’ll figure it out.
PH: What happens if all of the tokens for a particular artwork aren’t sold?
AK: If a painting is not completely sold within the allotted time, all issued NFTs are burned, and the refund option becomes available to users.

PH: Do art collectors receive proof of ownership when they buy an artwork piece on 10101.art?
AK: Of course. NFTs act as digital proof of ownership for the portion of the artwork purchased. They reside on a blockchain which tracks ownership and verifies its authenticity. Additionally, new artworks owners also receive a physical certificate of ownership upon purchase. 
PH: How do you decide which artworks to list on 10101.art?
AK: Our goal is to provide people with the most promising pieces possible, and to achieve that, we rely on a team of highly respected art experts and dealers from around the world.  They evaluate each artwork meticulously based on a number of key factors.
One of the top priorities is artistic significance. We want to feature works by the most influential artists throughout history, those who have truly shaped the art world.  These could be from any country or era, as long as their artistic impact is undeniable.
Another important factor is recognizability. There’s power in iconic styles. Our experts look for works with a clear artistic identity, pieces that are instantly recognizable by the artist’s signature style. 
Finally, authenticity is absolutely crucial. Our team carefully examines all documentation associated with a piece, including expert reports, certificates of authenticity, and a clear ownership history. This process ensures that the artwork we offer is genuine and has a verifiable past.
PH: When a new artwork is listed on 10101.art, how do you determine its valuation?
AK: We obtain this information from our network of curators and art dealers and align it with our business model, sticking to the principle of making the work accessible to our collectors, while maintaining margins that allow the business to grow.
PH: How do you handle the physical storage and display of those artworks? Are they displayed publicly?
AK: Every artwork presented on 10101.art is stored in Monada Art gallery in Dubai, DIFC. The gallery opened in 2023 and is now our official partner on exclusive terms who shares our vision and mission to make art accessible. 
PH: Can art collectors visit the artworks they have bought to see them in real life?
AK: Yes. Monada Art is open for anyone who wants to see our collection in person and get closer to fine art. Every visitor is welcomed there, so if you’re eager to visit the gallery we offer a tour with our gallery manager Dayana. 
PH: If an art collector wants to sell their NFTs at a later date, will 10101.art eventually offer a secondary market for this?
AK: Yes, we’re working on the development of a secondary platform. We’ll announce its launch soon on our social media. Keep posted!
PH: How has your background in finance influenced your approach to running 10101.art?
AK: My background in finance has been incredibly valuable in building 10101.art.  You might think finance and art are separate worlds, but financial literacy is crucial in the art market as well.
For example, risk management is a core skill in both fields. As an art platform, we need to carefully evaluate artists, artwork provenance, and market trends. This financial lens helps me steer 10101.art towards pieces that hold strong potential for our users.
Strategic thinking is another big one. Finance is all about planning for the long term, and that’s exactly what we’re doing at 10101.art. We’re not just chasing the next hot artist or trend. We’re building a platform that will reshape the art market for years to come. It’s about making high-value art accessible to a wider audience, while creating a new way to own a piece of art. By the way, let’s connect on LinkedIn if this idea resonates with you. 
PH: Can you offer our readers a sneak peek into any well known artworks you hope to list on 10101.art in the future?
AK: Every new artwork in our collection is a valuable masterpiece, so we’re willing to make every new arrival special. We’re ready to surprise you, so stay tuned for the updates!
PH: What are some of the most exciting trends you’re seeing in the art market today?
AK: Real world assets are a huge trend in the art market today. More and more art tokenization platforms, such as 10101.art appear. Even apart from art, lots of other industries started to tokenize physical objects valuable in real life. 
We in 10101.art are not just seeing this exciting trend, we’re leading it with a mission of making fine art more reachable.

Coinbase Q1 Crushes It, But Fickle Crypto Winds Linger - DailyCoin


        
Coinbase reported significantly better than expected Q1 results.



The company acknowledged the importance of revenue diversification.



Next quarter results appear on track.
With inflation remaining stubbornly high and interest rates unchanged since July 2023, modest earnings growth was the general expectation for earnings season. However, Coinbase bucked that trend spectacularly, releasing Q1 2024 numbers that blew Wall Street projections out of the water. The leading US crypto exchange earned $1,638 million in total revenue, trouncing estimates of $1,321 million and soaring 72% higher than the previous quarter. However, a period of recent crypto instability, in which Bitcoin sunk to a 9-week low of $56,600, served as a stark reminder of Coinbase’s precarious business model and its ability to deliver consistent growth and shareholder returns over the long term.Coinbase on a RollIn acknowledgment of its precarious business model, the Risk Factors Summary section of Coinbase’s current 10-Q report stated, “Our total revenue is substantially dependent on the prices of crypto assets and volume of transactions conducted on our platform.” The filing warned that a decline in either metric may negatively impact operations, including the company’s stock price. 
Nonetheless, Coinbase has taken strides to diversify its revenue streams beyond the core exchange trading fees. This quarter, its “Other subscription and services revenue” soared 122% year-over-year to $63,686 million, up from $28,682 million in Q1 2023. Subscriptions offer users benefits like zero fees, higher staking rewards, priority support, and advanced analytics tools.Custodial fee revenue jumped 90% to $32,341 million, compared to $17,043 million a year prior. The increase is largely attributed to Coinbase providing custody services for 90% of the Bitcoin ETFs that launched in the US in Q1.Subscription and services revenue figures per the latest Q-10 reportHowever, concerns continue to swirl around Coinbase’s ability to limit its exposure when the inevitable bear market arrives. Diversification StrategyCoinbase recognized that diversifying and growing its subscription and services revenue is key to mitigating its exposure to crypto price volatility. 
Owen Lau, analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., agreed that adopting a diversification strategy “can provide some downside protection” when cryptocurrency prices and volumes turn bearish.However, investor concerns continue to swirl about the company’s ability to build out these income streams further in the future.Q2 Appears on TrackThe shareholder letter painted an optimistic tone for Q2, stating that transaction revenue in April came in at $300 million, which is around on track to match Q1’s $1,077 million transaction revenue in Q1. However, Coinbase cautioned against projecting future quarterly results based on one month’s actual.The company provided a similarly positive forecast for its subscription and services revenue stream in Q2, estimating it will land between $525-$600 million, subject to crypto prices remaining at levels seen this year. This would approximately match or exceed Q1’s $511 million figure.On the Flipside
Shareholders celebrated the Q1 results as EPS came in at $4.40, smashing expectations of $1.15, and up 323% on Q4 2023.



Coinbase is subject to an SEC complaint which may impact the company‘s financial position going forward.



Before Q4 2023, Coinbase suffered seven consecutive quarters of losses.
Why This MattersCoinbase’s Q1 results underscore the paradox of being buoyed by Bitcoin’s overperformance yet shackled by its volatility. While revenue diversification such as subscriptions may offer some downside protection, it’s noted that all such diversified streams are still crypto-related.Coinbase seeks higher court intervention in SEC lawsuit case.Coinbase Appeals SEC Lawsuit: A Regulatory Turning Point?Analysts predict imminent altseason as Bitcoin Dominance plummets: Altseason Alert: Bitcoin Dominance Crumbles, Altcoins Primed

Edward Snowden Delivers ‘Final’ Bitcoin Warning: Here’s Why


								Edward Snowden, the well-known whistleblower, reiterated his long standing concerns about Bitcoin’s privacy features, or the lack thereof in a recent post on X. Snowden’s latest comments emerge in the wake of a significant announcement by the Wasabi Wallet team concerning their decision to discontinue their coinjoin coordination service, a cornerstone for enhancing user privacy on the Bitcoin network.
‘The Clock Is Ticking’ For Bitcoin, Says Snowden
Snowden expressed his frustration with the slow pace of privacy enhancements within Bitcoin’s protocol. “I’ve been warning Bitcoin developers for ten years that privacy needs to be provided for at the protocol level. This is the final warning. The clock is ticking,” Snowden posted on X, commenting on Wasabi Wallet’s announcement from yesterday.


Wasabi Wallet, developed by zkSNACKs, has been a pioneering solution aimed at enhancing privacy for Bitcoin transactions through its coinjoin coordination service. However, a recent blog post by the Wasabi Wallet team detailed their decision to halt this service as of June 1, 2024.

“After years of relentless dedication to improve Bitcoin’s privacy, zkSNACKs, the company pioneering the development of Wasabi Wallet, is shutting down its coinjoin coordination service,” the post read. The developers highlighted ongoing regulatory pressures and the need for legal clarity as key reasons behind their decision.
Despite discontinuing the coinjoin service, Wasabi Wallet will continue to operate as a conventional BTC wallet. The team assured users of continued privacy enhancements through other features like client-side filtering, Tor integration, and custom coin selection, though they acknowledged these measures do not ensure complete privacy on their own.

This development arrives amid increasing scrutiny and legal challenges facing crypto privacy tools. Notably, New York federal prosecutors recently charged the founders of another privacy-focused wallet, Samourai Wallet, with facilitating illegal transactions worth over $2 billion. This action is part of a broader crackdown by US authorities on wallets and mixers associated with illicit activities.
While Snowden has lauded Bitcoin in February as the “most significant monetary advance since the creation of coinage,” his concerns about BTC built-in privacy have been consistent. In November 2021, he lauded the advancements made by Zcash, another cryptocurrency known for its strong privacy features.
He stated, “Zcash meaningfully advanced what cryptocurrency could DO, and that’s what I admired about it. And my primary criticism of Bitcoin is still, so many years later, that they haven’t addressed its enormous on-chain privacy problem.”
In contrast, Samson Mow, a prominent figure in promoting nation-state adoption of Bitcoin, downplayed the significance of Wasabi’s announcement. Mow argued, “I don’t get why everyone is crying about this. Wasabi is open-source. You can run your own coordinator too. This is like the Pirate Bay saying they won’t seed torrents anymore. Yes, good and smart move.”
At press time, BTC traded at $61,900.

Ethereum's next price target - ETH can climb to $3,300 ONLY if... - AMBCrypto



Ethereum’s price appreciated by more than 2.5% in the last 24 hours 
Most metrics and market indicators looked bullish on ETH’s charts

As market sentiment changed over the last few hours, Ethereum [ETH] benefited from the same as its daily chart turned green. However, the latest uptick might just be the beginning of a massive rally, especially since the king of altcoins’ price is now moving inside a bullish pattern. 
Ethereum’s bullish move
The last 7 days weren’t in the investors’ best interests as ETH’s price dropped by over 5%. However, as the market trend changed, ETH also managed to push its price up by more than 2.5% in 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,988.30 with a market capitalization of over $358 billion. 
Interestingly, things might get even better for ETH in the coming days. World of Charts, a popular crypto-analyst, recently shared a tweet highlighting that the ETH/BTC pair was moving inside a falling edge pattern. A successful breakout from the pattern could result in ETH hitting new highs in the coming months. 
Therefore, AMBCrypto checked ETH’s metrics to see whether it would manage a breakout. Our analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that ETH’s network growth hiked over the last few days. Simply put, more addresses were created to transfer the token as its active withdrawal rate climbed last week. 
Additionally, Ethereum’s supply held by top addresses also rose slightly, suggesting that buying pressure on the token was high.
On the contrary, its MVRV ratio remained low. At press time, ETH’s MVRV ratio had a value of -6.22%.
Source: Santiment
Ethereum’s weekly target
Since most metrics seemed bullish, AMBCrypto then checked ETH’s daily chart to see whether a further uptrend was inevitable. 
We found that ETH’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp uptick from the neutral level. The Money Flow Index (MFI) also went north. Both of these indicators suggest that the chances of a sustained bull rally are high. 
On the other hand, the MACD supported the sellers as it flashed a bearish crossover on the charts. 
Source: TradingView
We then analyzed Hyblock Capital’s data to find out the possible targets ETH might hit this week if the bull rally lasts. In order for ETH to sustain the rally, it will be crucial for the token to go above $3,100, as liquidations would rise sharply. 

Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25 

A hike in liquidations could result in a price correction. A successful breakout above that level could allow ETH to climb to $3,300 by the end of this week if everything falls into place.

Following the record outflow in Bitcoin ETFs due to the influence of the FED, there was a serious decrease in yesterday's outflows! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States recorded net outflows of $34.4 million on Thursday, slowing compared to the previous day's record outflows.
Daily Outflows Decrease in Spot Bitcoin ETFs
Grayscale's GBTC, which has been experiencing persistent outflows, was the only ETF to record net fund outflows on Thursday, totaling $55 million, according to SoSoValue data.


In comparison, Ark Invest's ARKB led daily net inflows with $13 million inflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs from Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie, Invesco and Galaxy Digital reported smaller net inflows, totaling $6 million.
BlackRock and Fidelity's Bitcoin funds, which rank second and third in terms of total net assets, both recorded zero flows on Thursday.





Bloomberg's ETF analyst James Seyffart previously explained that a zero-flow day is within ETFs' normal operations.

A record was set for Bitcoin ETF outflows on Wednesday, recording $563.7 million, the largest outflow ever. Fidelity's FBTC, which started its fund outflow just last week, witnessed $191 million outflow from the fund, surpassing GBTC's outflow.


Wednesday also marked the first day of daily net fund outflows for BlackRock's IBIT.
However, industry experts emphasize that such fluctuations are not unusual in the ETF world. “These ETFs generally run smoothly. Entries and exits are part of the norm in the life of an ETF,” said James Seyffart, acknowledging the importance of the exit figure.

Why Bitcoin Spiked Above $62,000 Following The April Jobs Report - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD spiked to over $62,000 in Friday morning trading following the U.S. Labor Department’s April jobs report.What Happened: The data shows the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in April, falling short of the consensus estimate of 240,000. The unemployment rate came in at 3.9%, slightly higher than the expected 3.8%.Economist and trader Alex Krüger described the report as “bullish” and “weaker than expected payrolls, yet still strong,” noting that the crypto market’s reaction was in sync with other risk assets.Read Also: ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ Author Robert Kiyosaki Unveils His Bitcoin Strategy Amid Market Crash: ‘The Best Time To Get Rich’Why It Matters: The mixed results of the April jobs report have sparked a debate about the potential implications for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and the broader economy. Some analysts, such as James van Straten, lead analyst at CryptoSlate, argue that two potential rate cuts in 2024 could lead to more inflation while not bringing back jobs.Self-proclaimed value investor Mike Alfred sees the weakening US Dollar Index (DXY) as a bullish sign for Bitcoin and select mining stocks.Nick Timiraos, Chief economics correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, believes the April jobs report is unlikely to change much for the Federal Reserve. He sees the Fed more focused on inflation data, with another jobs report due before their next meeting but notes that the report “will certainly help ease fears about reacceleration/overheating.”The market reaction lends further credibility to the thesis that macroeconomic developments are back to being the main driver of short-term Bitcoin price action.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $61,770, up 5.5% over the past 24 hours. What’s Next: These topics are expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Federal Reserve Takes Cautious Stand On Inflation, Powell Signals Preference For Rate Cuts Over HikesThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Bitcoin Fees Normalize After Runes' Coming Out Party Abruptly Ends - The Defiant

Runes’ on-chain activity and Bitcoin transaction fees dropped more than 97% in two weeks.Bitcoin’s transaction fees have returned to normal after a brief parabolic spike triggered by the launch of Runes, the hyped protocol enabling the creation of Bitcon-based tokens.Data from Dune analytics shows that Runes’ daily transaction count tanked 97.5% to 19,000 from an all-time high of 753,584 on April 23. The pull-back coincides with Runes’ share of Bitcoin’s on-chain activity dropping to 30% from 81.3% over the same period.Breakdown of Bitcoin transaction volume by type. Source: Dune Analytics.However, the sharp decline in Runes activity has provided a respite for ordinary Bitcoin users.Average transaction fees on the network have pulled back by 97% to $3.60 since posting an all-time high of $128 on April 20 coinciding with the launch of Runes, according to BitInfoCharts. The record high marked a 4,375% increase in fees from $2.86 two weeks prior.Ryan Song, head at CoinWestern Ventures, a Bitcoin mining consultancy firm, told The Defiant that Bitcoin’s Rune-induced congestion was the result of an initial flurry of token minting driven by rampant Runes speculation."The Bitcoin network was experiencing a heavy increase in load, which can be largely attributed to minting,” Song said. “A wave of minting operations ensued due to heightened speculation around Runes, placing unnatural demands on the already limited Bitcoin block space.”Bitcoin transaction fees. Source: BitInfoChartsOn April 29, Glassnode reported that 53% of the $117 million in fee revenue collected by Runes was accrued on its first day. On April 28, daily fee revenue had crashed to just $1.03 million, down 98% since the protocol’s debut.Bitcoin tokensRunes went live on April 20, the same day as Bitcoin's fourth halving event, leading to a bottleneck in network activity that spiked transactions as users raced to deploy tokens using the protocol.Runes leverages Ordinals inscriptions in a bid to overcome the efficiencies associated with the BRC-20 protocol — which allowed users to create fungible tokens on Bitcoin for the first time when it launched in March 2023. While BRC-20 tokens quickly exploded in popularity, the protocol garnered criticism for being data-intensive, driving mempool congestion, and pushing up transaction fees on Bitcoin.Despite the sharp decline in Runes activity, the protocol appears to have secured a healthy dominance over Bitcoin token activity — which accounted for nearly one-quarter of Bitcoin transactions on May 3.Runes made up 81% of Bitcoin token transactions, followed by BRC-20 tokens with 12%, and Ordinals with 5.65%.

                        Meme coins are set for a renaissance in the coming months. While their novelty premise has detractors dismissing them as flash-in-the-pan phenomena, several meme coin projects have proven their worth over the years and become the closest thing the notoriously volatile crypto industry has to “safe money”.The number one contender right now is stalwart daddy Dogecoin. $DOGE is a cryptocurrency that claims to be both the first meme coin and the first canine coin.Launched in 2013, Dogecoin creators Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer initially created it to satirize the minting frenzy. For the two nocoiners, it was a cynical overture, but they didn’t bet on crypto fans loving it.People saw it as a symbol of crypto’s fun and irreverence as well as its viral appeal and supported it loyally for over a decade to help it become the ninth biggest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of nearly $20 billion dollars. It also has endorsements from a diverse array of celebrities, including Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons and Mark Cuban.But the big question is this: can Dogecoin go from a current price of $0.1317 all the way up to $1? The most straightforward answer is “not anytime soon.”It’s also looking like the reign of the dog coins is over. Several new species have entered the market with viral appeal. This list will examine the four biggest species of meme coin right now to see which projects have what it takes to hit $1 in 2024.Will Dogecoin Reach $1?
DOGE has come close. Two years ago at the height of the Bitcoin bull run, Dogecoin set an all-time high of $0.7316. However, there’s grounds to think that this was substantially overpriced by the market. Since then, Dogecoin has shed a lot of value, while Bitcoin has this year set new all-time highs.It would take another bull run or a new use case for Dogecoin in order to pump the asset up to a dollar. With regards to the former, many analysts say a bull run is incoming now that Bitcoin has completed its fourth quadrennial halving.The halving was a predetermined software update that happened on April 20 and slashed mining rewards in half. Since this has bottlenecked the amount of Bitcoin hitting the open market, it’s possible that there could be a new bull run in the coming months. Others have argued that the halving was priced in this time.And with regards to the underlying tech, Dogecoin is pretty old. Like Bitcoin, it uses a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, whereby the miners with the most computing and electricity resources mine the most $DOGE. Due to Dogecoin’s smart contract limitations, it also can’t really boast of having an ecosystem.That means among conscientious investors, it’s likely to take a backseat to more useful or energy-efficient coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) and Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE).How About Frogs and the Sloths?
Pepe Coin ($PEPE) is the third biggest meme coin in the world. Like Dogecoin, it’s based on a meme that everybody and their grandmas have heard of. However, its $3.4 billion market cap still puts it a digit short of being in the same league as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.At today’s price of $0.058114 and with a previous all-time high of $0.00001064, it’s dead certain that PEPE is not on track to claim a dollar. However, one project that could is the sloth-themed Slerf coin ($SLERF). Slerf has an interesting story. On launch day, a major mishap resulted in the accidental burning of $10 million in $SLERF, intended for some 25,000 trusting presale buyers.Shortly after launching, Slerf ratcheted an all-time high (ATH) market cap of $750 million wSealana ($SEAL), the all-American redneck seal, within a few hours. As 24-hour trading volume surged close to $2.5 billion, the token actually hit an ATH price of $1.28 from a launch price of $1.10 before falling to its current level. Still, at its current price, Slerf is more likely to hit a dollar than Dogecoin.But it’s currently getting stiff competition from Slothana, a new sloth meme token that is about to launch. $SLOTH is the same genus as $SLERF with one key difference. He’s a major pothead, and is likely to be a hit among likeminded slow creatures.Finally, There’s Sealana the Meme Coin $SEAL
If dogs, frogs and sloths don’t do it for you, Solana’s Sealana ($SEAL), the all-American redneck seal, is quickly opening purse strings in a hilarious new presale. Sealana is a spin on the viral South Park character Gamer Guy, aka Fat Computer Nerd. Gamer Guy appeared in the hit cartoon’s side-splitting World of Warcraft episode and instantly became a viral meme all on his own, recognizable by his milk-bottle glasses, screen-locked stare, messy room and gravity-defying girth. He has since symbolized anyone from the legions of disgruntled keyboard warriors writing sharp, acerbic opinions in internet comments sections, to a kind of Everyman – a symbol of the idler in everyone. Sealana is Gamer Guy but Web3. Beached at his PC desk and growing by the day, Sealana is so absorbed in degen trades that he’s abandoned his previously trim figure for a diet of chips and tinned tuna. His obsession with finding the next big Solana meme coin keeps his flippers busy and his room looking like a bomb hit it. A true patriot in search of the lost American Dream!VIDEOHis presale is barely 48 hours old and it has already taken in over $150,000 in investments, according to the website. There are rumors that the Sealana team was also behind the popular Slerf ($SLERF) project. Rumors suggest that the team wants another successful launch, this time without accidentally burning $10m in tokens.For every 1 SOL, investors get 6,900 $SEAL tokens after the ICO’s concludes. This puts them in pole position to exploit some potentially explosive appreciation through the presale and beyond.Users can pay using a widget on the website or by sending SOL from a decentralized wallet to this address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.Interested?

Bitcoin’s (BTC) Recent Weakness Has Not Been Isolated to Crypto Markets, Coinbase Says

The problem with looking at U.S. ETF inflows as a proxy for global price discovery is most obvious with gold, Coinbase said. The largest gold ETF in the U.S., SPDR Gold Shares, has had a net outflow of $3 billion in 2024 even as the precious metal has risen 12% year-to-date.

Bitcoin Price Leaps Over $61k Following US Unemployment Data - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin leaped over $61,000 in the hour that followed the release of a government employment report.At time of publication, the price of Bitcoin is around $61,640, up 5.2% on the day, according to data from CoinGecko.Bitcoin's price surge followed the U.S. government’s Nonfarm Payrolls report, published this morning, which forecasted that the unemployment rate for April was 3.9%—that's 0.1% higher than the 3.8% expected.High unemployment makes it more likely that the Fed will consider lowering interest rates, increasing the attractiveness of risk assets like stocks and crypto.The Fed lowered rates to between zero to 0.25% in response to the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. But two years later, in March 2022, the Fed began hiking rates to fight inflation. The hikes continued until they peaked at 5.25% to 5.50% in July 2023. Bitcoin ended that month at $29,230.11, down 4.1% for the month and half the price it is now.It’s been a rocky week for Bitcoin. Since the Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs went live, on April 30, Bitcoin’s price tumbled, first  to below $60,000 and eventually slipping below $57,000.This led Bitcoin billionaire Arthur Hayes to predict that Bitcoin's price has bottomed out. In a blog post, the former BitMEX CEO predicted that prices would “bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher.”Bitcoin ETFs have been taking a hit with a weekly outflow of $599 million, according to CoinShares. The U.S. in particular took a huge hit of $860 million outflowing, with BlackRock’s IBIT fund taking its first daily loss yesterday. Hong Kong’s ETFs were a bright spot, though, flowing in nearly $300 million in its first week.Ethereum has seen similar gains, since the publication of the Nonfarm Payroll report, climbing 2.8% to around $3,050. Over the same period Solana jumped 4.4% to around $142, amid a crazy week for meme coins on the blockchain.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

‘There’s Not Much More Downside Left To Go’: Trader Says Bitcoin Close to Bottom After Deepest Retrace of Cycle - The Daily Hodl


								A cryptocurrency analyst and trader is saying Bitcoin (BTC) may have reached a market bottom after correcting down into the high $50,000 range.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 74,900 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin’s latest correction is the cycle’s deepest, suggesting a further decline is unlikely.










“This single corrective period is now the deepest corrective period in this cycle to date. It has eclipsed the 23% corrective period that we saw in early 2023. This is now deeper than that. This is getting to even minus 24% territory. So, we now know this is the deepest retrace in this cycle.”
Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube
Given the relative degree of the correction, the analyst believes Bitcoin is most likely bottoming at these price levels and will start to rally once more. He also says another reason he believes the bottom may be in is because the correction is currently the second longest at about 50 days.
“I think there’s not much more downside left to go. So the risk-to-reward ratio here is definitely favoring the bulls in terms of getting to a bottom quite soon because we’re seeing retrace depth get to the point where it’s the deepest correction in this cycle…
We have a deep correction. We have a long correction. How much deeper can it be? How much longer can it go on for? We are getting really close to the bottom here just based on pullbacks in this cycle.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $59,332 at time of writing, up more than 2% in the last 24 hours.

At press time, the coin is trading at $0.00000801.This is a whopping 31.5% price surge since Wednesday this week. One of the factors that has driven this price surge is the major U.S. exchange Kraken adding a PEPE-based margin pair, exposing the cryptocurrency to millions of traders.PEPE emerged in April last year. Made by an anonymous developer team, it was inspired by a popular meme based on the Pepe the Frog character. Several major exchanges quickly added support for PEPE last year, and this contributed to the expansion of its popularity on the cryptocurrency market.

Friend.Tech Launches Version 2 With Native Token Airdrop, But Not Everything Goes According To Plan... - Benzinga

Decentralized social platform Friend.Tech made a splash on Friday with the launch of its highly anticipated version 2 and the airdrop of its native token. What Happened: However, the initial excitement was quickly tempered by a dramatic price crash and technical issues plaguing the airdrop process.Starting its trading journey on the Base network—a Coinbase-supported Layer-2 blockchain for Ethereum ETH/USD—the FRIEND token wicked to a high of $169. However, the excitement was short-lived as it quickly retracted to trade below $1.30 at the time of writing, according to data from DexScreener.Friend.Tech, which began operations in August of the previous year as an invite-only platform, has been known for rewarding user engagement with a points system. The introduction of the Money Club is expected to enhance this model by providing a dedicated space for financial discussions and networking, further enriching the community experience.Despite the buzz surrounding the version 2 launch and the FRIEND token airdrop—initially slated for April 20 but later adjusted—the platform’s total locked crypto assets have seen a decline. From a peak of $52.04 million in early October, the value has dipped below $25 million, marking a 40% drop, according to data from DeFiLlama.Also Read: Bitcoin Market In Distribution: Are We Nearing A Bottom?The run-up to the release saw a flurry of activity as users anticipated the new features and token rewards. Yet, not all has gone smoothly post-launch. The platform captured a snapshot last week for a 100% airdrop of the FRIEND token, but several users have encountered issues with claiming their tokens. Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Reetika Malik voiced her frustrations on social media platform X, stating, “I’m not selling my FRIEND airdrop (cause I can’t even claim it).”These developments highlight the volatile nature of cryptocurrency projects and the challenges faced by platforms in managing user expectations and technical deployments. What’s Next: As Friend.Tech navigates these hurdles, the broader implications of such innovations will be a key topic at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: MoonPay Partners With PayPal To Simplify Crypto Purchases For US UsersImage: Shutterstock

Bitcoin, the first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to lows of $56,500 earlier in the week as investors became jittery about the Fed interest rate decision. In what seemingly soothed the markets, Fed Chair Jerome Powell doused fears about interest rate hikes, stating that this was unlikely to be the Fed's next move presently. Bitcoin then started to rebound. On-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock noted that Bitcoin's drop below $57,000 brought it to the same levels of holders in loss as in similar drawbacks in the previous cycle. IntoTheBlock highlights the key supply and demand levels to watch for Bitcoin as the crypto market faces uncertainty. These levels have emerged as points of interest, reflecting the ongoing battle between bulls and bears as Bitcoin seeks direction amid volatile market conditions.The $62,000 level is seen as a significant resistance point, a price at which there are a substantial amount of sell orders. Here, Bitcoin faces significant selling pressure from traders looking to capitalize on short-term gains. This level represents a psychological barrier for many market participants, who view it as a potential point of reversal or consolidation in Bitcoin's price trajectory.Conversely, the $58,000 mark is viewed as a crucial support level, a price at which buy orders accumulate, reflecting strong demand. This is seen as a critical line in the sand for Bitcoin bulls, who are keen to defend this level and prevent further downside movement. A breach of this support zone could trigger additional selling pressure and potentially lead to a deeper correction in Bitcoin's price.In the days ahead, market participants will closely monitor price action for clues about Bitcoin's next move. The recent volatility on the market, driven by a combination of macroeconomic factors and investor sentiment, has heightened uncertainty and added to the significance of these supply and demand zones.At the time of writing, BTC was up 0.37% in the last 24 hours to $59,095.

Dutch Authorities Bust Alleged Gambling Platform Scam, Seize Millions - Coin Edition


							

Dutch authorities arrest suspects in alleged $30M crypto scam on Zkasino platform



The ZKasino platform is said to have promised high returns but was designed to fail.



The FIOD seized €11.4M in crypto, real estate & a luxury car linked to the suspect.




Dutch authorities, the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) has cracked down on a large-scale online gambling platform scam on April 29th, 2024. They arrested a 26-year-old man suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering in connection with ZKasino which is the platform at the center of the investigation.







The investigation revealed a concerning pattern. Over $30 million USD in cryptocurrency had been invested by victims worldwide on ZKasino. The platform allegedly promised high returns within a short timeframe of 30 days.



However, a technical analysis of the platform’s smart contract – the self-executing code governing its operations – revealed a crucial detail. The contract was deliberately designed in a way that made it impossible to deliver the promised returns. This strongly suggests a “rug pull” scheme, a notorious crypto scam tactic where developers vanish with investor funds after raising capital through a project.









FIOD officials swiftly took action. A search warrant was executed, leading to the seizure of digital evidence as well as over €11.4 million worth of assets. This included real estate likely purchased with stolen funds and a luxury car that could be used by the suspect. Mulitple cryptocurrencies are believed to be linked to the scam. To ensure a thorough investigation, the suspect’s detention was extended by a court order.



The investigation itself was initiated based on reports on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) and intelligence gathered by FIOD’s own departments. Recognizing the evolving nature of financial crime, FIOD collaborated with cryptocurrency exchange Binance. This collaboration proved crucial, as it helped secure millions of euros in stolen cryptocurrencies before they could be further dispersed or laundered.

Market Movers Today: Apple, Amgen, Expedia, Fortinet - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



One of the highlights of today’s market so far is Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) rise to $184.55 at the time of writing, up over 6.5% after the tech giant announced a record-setting $110 billion stock buyback. Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) is also seeing impressive gains due to the excitement surrounding its weight-loss drug. Notable losers today include Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE) and Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT).



Amgen, Live Nation Entertainment, and Apple Lead the Pack



Amgen led the pack with an impressive 12.79% surge, reaching a live price of $314, up from the previous close of $278.39. Wall Street’s excitement over the company’s weight-loss drug fueled this remarkable increase, marking Amgen’s best day since 2009. Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE: LYV) followed closely with an 8.64% increase, as its stock price climbed to $95.9 from $88.27, driven by a boom in concert ticket sales that led to revenue outperforming estimates.



Apple also had a strong showing, rising by 6.66% to hit $184.55, up from $173.03. The company’s announcement of a $110 billion buyback and a positive earnings report propelled this jump, resulting in its most significant rally in 18 months. Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) gained 6.42%, with its price moving to $112.87 from $106.06, as the company’s expansion of deployments in Florida showcased strong investor interest. Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG) went up by 5.3%, reaching $3,657.09 from $3,472.91, as analysts adjusted their price targets upwards, reflecting confidence in the company’s growth.



Other notable gainers included Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG) with a 5.12% rise, Digital Realty Trust (NYSE: DLR) with a 5.1% increase, Motorola Solutions (NYSE: MSI) advancing by 4.98%, Builders FirstSource (NYSE: BLDR) and First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR) both seeing a 4.63% increase, and Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET) rising by 3.98%. These increases were driven by various factors, such as dividend declarations, AI stock plays, adjusted price targets, positive analyst reports, and strong corporate performance.





Expedia and Fortinet Among Notable Declines Today



On the other hand, several stocks experienced notable declines. Illumina (NASDAQ: ILMN) dropped by 3.09%, with its price at $120.16, down from $123.99, following mixed analyst adjustments and a widening adjusted operating loss. Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) fell by 3.16%, with its price at $732.03, down from $755.91, amidst a competitive weight-loss drug market affecting investor sentiment. Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH) decreased by 4.18%, with its live price at $98.68, down from $102.98, due to a missed earnings expectation and concerns over FDA warnings related to unapproved syringes.



Trimble (NASDSAQ: TRMB) saw a 5.08% decline, with its price at $57.04, down from $60.09, as the company’s downbeat quarterly forecast contributed to the negative movement. Ingersoll Rand (NYSE: IR) dropped by 6.54%, with its price at $86.78, down from $92.85, following earnings that, despite beating expectations, did not meet investor optimism.



DaVita (NYSE: DVA) fell by 6.71%, with its price at $132.69, down from $142.24, linked to a challenging healthcare market and investor reactions to quarterly results. Fortinet experienced an 8.18% decrease, with its live price at $59.87, down from $65.20, following a mixed earnings report and downward adjustments by analysts. Expedia plummeted by 13.85%, with its price at $117.24, down from $136.09, attributed to a disappointing earnings report and lowered price targets by analysts.

Pepe's Rapidly Soaring $2.5B Futures Outstrip ARB & Optimism - DailyCoin


        
PEPE coin flips two popular Layer-2 blockchains by global market cap.



10 days ago, Coinbase listed PEPE on Futures after numerous delays.



PEPE jumped into crypto’s TOP 30 as Futures volume surpassed DOGE.
In a rather surprising turn of events, the popular frog-themed meme coin Pepe (PEPE) surged past Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP). These two popular Layer-2 blockchains built atop Ethereum (ETH) now encircle a smaller market capitalization than PEPE.PEPE Inks 11% Daily Gains Against All OddsPEPE’s price trend reversal came on May 1, after the token fell to its monthly lows at $0.00000609. As the general crypto markets succumbed to an all-round drawdown, the leading crypto asset, Bitcoin (BTC), plunged to $56K, a level unseen since late February 2024.Sporting a very low price correlation with Bitcoin, Pepe was among the first altcoins to bounce back from the double-digit deficit incurred since last week. Over the past 24 hours, PEPE soared by 11%, completing a 50% run over the past two weeks. This coincides with crypto whales and sharks piquing attention to PEPE, as a massive $591M was transacted in PEPE over the past 7-days.PEPE Futures Explodes With $2.5B On DemandMost of PEPE’s market sentiment-defying run can be attributed to the skyrocketing demand for the memecoin in Derivatives markets. Indeed, the latest on-chain data from CoinGlass tells us that PEPE Futures now encompasses a $2.48 billion volume, which makes PEPE the leading meme coin in Derivatives markets.
To compare, Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest memecoin by global market capitalization, accounted for $2.13 billion in Derivatives volume over the past 24-hour period. In addition, the Open Interest (OI) metric for PEPE Futures has risen by 27.97%, which indicates that Derivatives traders have renewed interest in the token.The popularity of PEPE Futures comes amid Coinbase’s listing of the memecoin on its advanced and International platforms.
However, most PEPE Futures trades occur on Binance and Bybit. Intriguingly, Binance’s users seem to be more bullish on PEPE than the rest. Binance’s long versus short ratio stands at 1.1137, while the overall long versus short positions are balanced at 1.0239. Judging by recent liquidations, short sells are having a hard time with $1.36M liquidated over the past 24 hours.On the Flipside
As PEPE holders are waiting for a plausible Coinbase Spot listing, the Spot markets also picked up a substantial hike in trading volume.



With $1,707,898,087 in 24-hour trading volume, PEPE sales on Spot still outweigh the bids by $3 million, seeing a 22% hike in combined orders.
Why This MattersPEPE token is among the top-performing alternative crypto assets in yearly terms, with 654% gains over the latest 365-day timeframe.Delve into DailyCoin’s trending crypto stories:BTCC Sets 10M USDT Rewards for Its World Trading ContestSolana Founder Sneers at Claims of Memecoin Scaring Builders

Fidelity: US Pension Funds Explore Crypto And Bitcoin, Eyeing $10 Trillion AUM | Bitcoinist.com


								According to a recent survey by Fidelity Digital Assets, institutional investors, including US pension plans, are increasingly inclined to invest in crypto assets, including Bitcoin. 
The survey covered various institutional investor segments, including financial advisors, family offices, hedge funds, endowments, foundations, and pension funds. 
Institutional Investors Dominate Crypto Adoption
The survey findings indicate a significant surge in institutional interest in crypto assets. Of the total respondents, 74% expressed their intention to buy or invest in digital assets in the future, a slight increase from 71% in the previous year. 
Notably, US high-net-worth investors showcased a substantial rise in their preference for crypto assets, with future interest surging from 31% to 74% year over year.

Despite the positive sentiment, the survey also illuminated the concerns and barriers faced by institutional investors. Price volatility emerged as the most significant obstacle, with 50% of respondents citing it as their primary concern. 
Other key concerns included the lack of fundamentals to gauge appropriate value (37%), security issues (35%), market manipulation (35%), and regulatory classification of certain coins as “unregistered securities” (33%).
The survey highlighted a notable shift in perception among institutional investors. Investors in the US and Europe reported increased familiarity, improved perception, and a higher number of crypto asset investments. Europe has caught up with Asia in terms of overall adoption and positive perception, while the US still lags behind.
In terms of specific investor groups, high-net-worth investors, crypto hedge funds/venture capital firms, and financial advisors exhibited the highest adoption rates and consideration of digital assets. 
This higher adoption may be attributed to the organizational structures and investment decision-making policies of these groups. On the other hand, family offices, pensions/defined benefit plans, traditional hedge funds, and endowments and foundations showed lower levels of adoption.
Bitcoin ETFs Garner Strong Interest
The survey also explored the features of digital assets that institutional investors find most appealing. The potential for high upside, the opportunity for innovative tech investments, and the enablement of decentralization were cited as the most attractive aspects. 
Additionally, participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) and yield opportunities gained more attention compared to the previous year, while concerns about lack of correlation decreased.
The study suggests that institutional investors in Europe and Asia are more accepting of digital assets in their portfolios than their US counterparts.

Ultimately, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and multi-digital asset funds, both actively and passively managed, emerged as the most appealing products among surveyed investors. European respondents also expressed interest in digital asset interest accrual offerings. Fidelity Digital Assets also expressed the following: 
The increased adoption reflected in the data speaks to a strong first half of the year for the digital assets industry. While the markets have faced many headwinds in recent months, we believe that digital assets fundamentals remain strong and that the institutionalization of the market over the past several years has positioned it to weather recent events. Institutional investors are experienced in managing through cycles, and the largely inherent factors that they cited as appealing in this study will likely remain as the market emerges from this period.

Bitcoin price prediction - Should you buy and is $100K still on the cards? - AMBCrypto



BTC recovered over 3.5% of its value in the last 24 hours 
Selling pressure on Bitcoin rose, despite the recent price hike 

The past week was somewhat of a bloodbath for Bitcoin [BTC] as its value dropped below $56,000 on the charts. The FUD around the cryptocurrency fueled speculations, with many expecting BTC to fall even further down. 
However, the market trend changed over the last 24 hours. In fact, some would argue that Bitcoin is finally taking its first steps towards $100k now. 
Bitcoin eyeing $100k?
Bitcoin finally got rid of the bears as its daily chart turned green. According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, BTC was up by more than 3.5% in just 24 hours. It was trading at $59,623.01, with a market capitalization of over $1.17 trillion. 
Meanwhile, Titan on Crypto, a popular crypto-analyst, recently shared a tweet highlighting an interesting development. As per the tweet, the last price correction might have been the last deviation from BTC’s road towards $100k. This seemed to be the case as well as historically, whenever such deviations have happened, BTC’s price has gained bullish momentum soon after. 
To be precise, similar episodes happened in March 2023, June 2023, and January 2024. 
The possibility of BTC touching $100k in the coming weeks is high now, especially since the coin’s network-to-value (NVT) ratio dropped – A sign that the coin may be undervalued.
Source: Glassnode
Are investors buying Bitcoin?
Since the chances of a bull rally seem to be high, this might be the right opportunity for investors to accumulate BTC.
 Therefore, AMBCrypto checked Bitcoin’s metrics to see whether buying pressure was high. We found that BTC’s exchange balance registered a sharp upward trend. At press time, BTC’s exchange balance stood at 2.33 billion BTC. 
Source: Glassnode
This indicated that investors have been selling BTC. On top of that, BTC’s supply on exchanges rose last week, while its supply outside of exchanges dropped. 
The fact that selling pressure on BTC was high was further proven by its exchange inflow, which spiked multiple times in the last seven days. 
Source: Santiment
Here, it is interesting to note that the hike in selling pressure didn’t have a negative impact on market sentiment. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that BTC’s weighted sentiment hiked, suggesting the dominance of bullish sentiment.

Finally, its social volume also remained high, reflecting the king of crypto’s popularity in the crypto space. 
Whether investors’ confidence will be enough for BTC to stick to its road to $100k will be an enticing episode to keep an eye on.

Nigerian Fintechs Take Stand Against Crypto: Users Feel the Heat - Coin Edition


							

Nigerian fintechs, including Moniepoint, PalmPay, and Paga, tighten measures against crypto.



Users face account blocks as Nigerian fintech platforms enforce CBN directives.



Moniepoint notifies customers of account closure for engaging in crypto transactions.




Several Nigerian fintech platforms, including Moniepoint, PalmPay, and Paga, have intensified their measures against cryptocurrency transactions. These actions align with directives from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Users of these platforms now face the risk of having their accounts blocked if they engage in crypto-related activities.



On May 2, 2024, Moniepoint issued a notification to its customers. It stated that accounts involved in crypto transactions would be closed. It also mentioned that user details would be shared with relevant authorities. This step follows CBN’s guidelines for regulating the digital currency space.







Similarly, PalmPay and Paga have also communicated to their customers the risks of engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. A user of PalmPay reported that his account was frozen due to such activities. The account will only be unfrozen if he agrees to abstain from any future crypto transactions.







In a recent email, Paga reiterated its commitment to adhering to CBN’s regulations. They reminded their customers that transactions in cryptocurrency are strictly prohibited. This is in compliance with a 2017 CBN circular. The circular warns financial institutions about their interactions with crypto exchanges and individuals transacting in cryptocurrencies.



In December 2023, the CBN seemed to soften its stance on cryptocurrencies. It issued a circular allowing financial institutions to open accounts and provide services for crypto firms. This circular also claimed to supersede previous ones from 2017 and 2021. However, recent actions by fintech firms suggest a more stringent application of the rules.



Earlier, Coinedition media reported on directives from the CBN to all banks and financial institutions. They were instructed to identify and monitor individuals or entities transacting with cryptocurrency exchanges. According to these directives, such accounts must be placed under a Post No Debit (PND) instruction for six months.



Under the PND instructions, customers are prohibited from performing certain transactions. These include withdrawing funds or making payments. The CBN also identified several crypto exchanges such as Bybit, KuCoin, OKX, and Binance. These platforms are said to lack the necessary operational licenses in Nigeria.



This move is part of a broader effort by the Nigerian government to regulate the cryptocurrency market. The government aims to prevent potential risks associated with unregulated digital currencies. These risks include money laundering and other illegal activities.

$2,700,000 To Be Given Away, No Strings Attached, As Google-Backed Guaranteed Income Pilot Prepares for Launch - The Daily Hodl


								Tech giant Google is backing a new multi-million dollar guaranteed income project.
The pilot program, dubbed “It All Adds Up,” is preparing to give a total of $2.7 million to 225 families that are struggling with homelessness in San Francisco.










The five-year program will begin by giving $1,000 per month to each family for one year.
“It takes four full-time minimum wage jobs to afford a two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco. In addition to rent, many families spend guaranteed income on basic necessities – and in doing so, they can begin to lift up and think beyond the day-to-day…
Here in the U.S., pilots have taken off in every region—from Tacoma, Washington, to Madison, Wisconsin, and Gainesville, Florida. But no one has evaluated the impact of GBI on Bay Area families and housing stability until now.”
An additional 225 families will act as a control group for the study by receiving $50 per month for a year.
The program is open to families who have used the Compass Family Services or Hamilton Families housing programs.
Participants will be able to use the money however they choose, and researchers will use administrative data and information collected from surveys to track the outcomes.
The program is backed by Google’s charitable arm, known as Google.org, and The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab.

Venture capital pours $2.4B into crypto startups in early 2024

After three consecutive quarters of decline, crypto and blockchain startups have witnessed a significant uptick in venture capital investment.According to data compiled by Galaxy Research, investors injected $2.49 billion across 603 deals in the first quarter of 2024, representing a 29% increase in funding and a 68% rise in deal count from the previous quarter. A sustained recovery must be confirmed by subsequent quarters of growth, the report states, adding:“This was the first rise in both capital invested and deal count in 3 quarters, perhaps signaling that Q4 2023 was the “bottom,” although a continuation of QoQ increases – and a more meaningful increase – would confirm that over the coming quarters.”Several factors influenced this quarter’s investment dynamics, including the introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), innovations in areas such as restaking, modularity, and Bitcoin layer-2 solutions, as well as macroeconomic factors such as interest rates.Capital Invested and Deal Count in 1Q24. Source: Galaxy ResearchThe historical correlation between Bitcoin prices and venture capital investments in crypto has weakened over the past year. The report notes that while Bitcoin has shown considerable price increases, venture capital activity has been stagnant until the recent surge in early 2024. However, investment levels are still not comparable to those reached when Bitcoin previously exceeded $60,000.In addition, 80% of the invested capital in the quarter was allocated to early-stage startups. In contrast, later-stage companies faced tougher conditions, as many larger, generalist venture capital firms have either left the sector or substantially cut back their investments, noted Galaxy. Capital invested by category and stage. Source: Galaxy ResearchInvestment activity within the industry was dominated by the infrastructure sector, which accounted for 24% of total capital raised in the quarter, including EigenLayer’s $100 million funding round. Moreover, the Web3 and trading sectors captured 21% and 17% of the total capital, respectively.Geographically, the United States remained a dominant force in the crypto venture space, with American startups involved in 37.3% of all deals and capturing 42.9% of the invested capital. Singapore followed with 10.8% of the total deal count, while the United Kingdom had 10.2%, Switzerland had 3.5%, and Hong Kong had 3.2%.Furthermore, Galaxy notes that fundraising conditions remain challenging, with macroeconomic conditions and regulatory uncertainties weighing on the industry:“At the start of 2024, investors widely believed that rates would come down significantly over 2024, but throughout Q1, strong inflation data has tempered expectations for rate cuts this year, which has helped maintain a difficult fundraising environment for venture capitalists.”Magazine: ‘Crypto is inevitable’ so we went ‘all in’ — Meet Vance Spencer, permabull

Is This The Time To Buy Altcoins? Crypto Researcher Sees These '2 Main Options' - Benzinga

Viktor, a pseudonymous researcher focused on decentralized finance, recently shared his thoughts on the potential for altcoins to outperform Bitcoin BTC/USD in the current market.What Happened: In his latest tweet, the researcher noted that altcoins have been performing better than Bitcoin during the recent market downturn. He proposed two possible scenarios: altcoins could suffer a significant drop in the next downward move, or they might not have many sellers left relative to Bitcoin due to the April 12-13 liquidation cascades.Coinglass data indicates that Bitcoin’s long liquidations on April 13 peaked at a multi-month high of $261.1 million. Citing these dumps as evidence, he leans towards the second scenario.He observed that while Bitcoin was only slightly down from the top, some altcoins had already dropped by 50%. This, he suggested, indicated that the risk-reward was in favor of altcoins versus Bitcoin, especially for those who entered close to the April 13 bottom of $65,000.Also Read: Bitcoin Headed For A ‘W-Shaped Reversal,’ Says Crypto Expert, Who Sees Altseason ‘Around The Corner’Why It Matters: Viktor also drew parallels to the market dumps in May and June 2022, where altcoins were severely impacted during the Luna collapse in May but then outperformed Bitcoin for nearly three months following the 3AC/Celsius collapse in June."What’s more, June 2022 would have been the bottom if it wasn’t for FTX," he notes.While the overall market health depends on Bitcoin’s performance, Viktor sees the current $57,000 zone as a potential bottom for the crypto king, given the likelihood of investors front-running the $52,000 support level.In another tweet, on May 2, VIKTOR notes the highest volume of coins on Bybit perpetual. While the top three are Bitcoin, Ethereum ETH/USD, and Solana SOL/USD, the list is followed by Pepe PEPE/USD, Dogecoin DOGE/USD, and Dogwifhat WIF/USD, reporting the largest increases of 14%, 4%, and 15%, respectively.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Is Bitcoin’s Fall Over?

Crypto trader loses $70.5 million in address poisoning scam, highest recorded yet

Blockchain security firm Cyvers Alert reported that an unnamed crypto trader lost 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), equivalent to $70.5 million worth, to address poisoning.The firm said:“Are we mistaken, or has someone truly lost $68 million worth of WBTC? Our system has detected another address falling victim to address poisoning, losing 1,155 WBTC.”Meir Dolev, the founder and CTO of Cyvers, added that this was “probably the highest value lost due to an address-poisoning scam.”Address poisoningAddress poisoning is one tactic malicious entities employ to exploit crypto traders. This nefarious act typically ensnares victims by luring them into transferring digital assets to fraudulent addresses owned by scammers.The modus operandi involves creating addresses strikingly similar to the target’s, employing identical starting and ending characters to deceive unsuspecting victims.Subsequently, they execute a crypto transfer from the newly fabricated matching address to the target’s wallet, contaminating the transaction history. The victim, unaware, inadvertently copies the tainted address from the transaction log instead of referencing their records, thereby directing funds into the hacker’s wallet.Notably, this kind of attack has become somewhat prevalent in the industry, with Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, highlighting one such incident last year. At the time, Zhao said:“The scammers are so good now they generate addresses with the same starting and ending letters, which is what most people check for when doing a crypto transfer. In fact, many wallets hide the middle part of the address with ‘…’ to make the UI look better.”Mentioned in this article

Second Day of Data on Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs Arrived! What is the situation according to the first day data! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Hong Kong's three spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced a significant decline in Bitcoin inflows on the second trading day.
Bitcoin Inflows into Hong Kong's Spot ETFs Drop on Second Trading Day
ETFs managed by China Asset Management (ChinaAMC), Harvest, Bosera, and HashKey saw inflows of 174.73 BTC ($10.3 million), compared to inflows of 3,910 BTC ($240 million) on the first day of trading.


Despite the drop, trading volume remained steady at over $9.7 million on both days, according to SoSoValue data.
SoSoValue clarified that physical Bitcoin ETF shares purchased do not generate dollar-denominated cash inflows. Therefore, these are not included in the daily net entry statistics.





The firm instead uses a BTC inflow metric, which measures the actual amount of bitcoin entering or leaving all ETFs on a given trading day.

As of Thursday, the ETFs held approximately 4,000 BTC, with total net assets decreasing slightly from $247.7 million on the first day to $235.7 million. May 1 was a public holiday in Hong Kong and markets were closed.


Among the three spot Bitcoin products, the ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF had the largest net assets at approximately $115.6 million. Harvest's ETF had about $62.4 million and the Bosera HashKey Bitcoin ETF had about $57.7 million.
Unlike the Hong Kong market, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US experienced net outflows of $34.4 million today, following record outflows of $563.7 million the day before.

As the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price continues to navigate through a period of consolidation, on-chain data reveals a surprising insight: a massive 733 trillion SHIB tokens held in wallets remain profitable despite the current lull in SHIB's price. This revelation underscores the resilience and long-term commitment of SHIB holders, despite short-term fluctuations in market sentiment.The Break Even Price indicator looks at realized gains and losses based on on-chain data for addresses that are currently holding the crypto asset. Despite the recent SHIB price lull, this on-chain indicator reveals a substantial portion of SHIB holders continue to hold onto their tokens at levels where they are in profit.Shiba Inu (SHIB) Break Even Price, Courtesy: IntoTheBlockAccording to IntoTheBlock's breakeven price indicator, a whopping 733.61 trillion SHIB held by 653,530 Shiba Inu addresses are in profit, having been bought in the range of $0.000002 and $0.000022 at an average price of $0.000011. This figure highlights the significant accumulation of tokens by SHIB holders who have weathered multiple market cycles and remain committed to their hodling strategy. Furthermore, this might suggest that many holders are taking a long-term perspective on their SHIB holdings. Rather than succumbing to short-term market volatility, these holders are focused on the potential future growth and adoption of SHIB, as well as the development of the broader Shiba Inu ecosystem.SHIB price actionAt the time of writing, SHIB was up 4% in the last 24 hours to $0.00002372, matching the general market recovery. After five straight days of falls, the SHIB price began to recover from its May 1 low of $0.0000223. Shiba Inu is continuing its recovery into the third day, achieving highs of $0.00002383 in today's session. Shiba Inu has been consolidating in a large range between $0.00001837 and $0.00003285, following its slide from highs of $0.000045 on March 5. In the very short term, a sustained break above the daily moving average 50 at $0.00002635 might spark a new move for the SHIB price, with targets at $0.0000328 and, eventually, the $0.0000457 level.

How to determine crypto cost basis for accurate tax filings

What is cost basis in crypto?In the context of cryptocurrencies, “cost basis” refers to the initial outlay paid for digital assets. It is an important consideration when calculating capital gains or losses from the sale or disposal of cryptocurrencies. The capital gains or losses on an investor’s crypto sale are calculated as the selling price minus the cost basis.To avoid tax complications, the cost basis must be reported accurately; otherwise, one may have an underpayment or overpayment of taxes, which may result in fines from the tax authorities. Furthermore, accurate reporting is much more important due to the increased scrutiny that tax authorities throughout the world are placing on crypto transactions.Tax authorities require individuals to declare their cryptocurrency transactions for tax purposes in numerous jurisdictions, including the United States. Penalties and audits may result from inaccurate cost basis reporting. As a result, investors must keep thorough records of all of their cryptocurrency transactions, including the purchase price, the date of the transaction and any additional costs. Common methods for calculating crypto cost basisThere are various methods to calculate the cost basis for cryptocurrencies, as discussed below:Specific identificationSpecific identification is a popular method for calculating the cost basis of cryptocurrency holdings. Investors are able to determine and monitor the cost basis of each cryptocurrency asset separately using this method. Investors who are selling or disposing of crypto assets indicate the exact units they are selling and the price at which they were purchased.Because this method accounts for the specific purchase price of the units being sold, it enables an accurate cost basis calculation. It is especially helpful for investors who wish to carefully choose what units to sell depending on their cost basis and holding duration to optimize their tax outcomes. To understand how this method works, let’s consider a hypothetical example: An investor purchased 1 Bitcoin (BTC) on Jan. 1, 2023, for $30,000 and 1 BTC on May 1, 2023, for $50,000. They can select which particular purchase to utilize as their cost basis if they choose to sell 1 BTC.To implement a specific identification method, every crypto transaction must be meticulously documented, including the purchase price, date and any associated costs. Compared to other approaches, it may also be more difficult and time-consuming to execute, even if it provides the highest level of accuracy in cost basis reporting.First-in, first-out (FIFO)Another common way to calculate the cost basis of crypto holdings is the “first-in, first-out” (FIFO) method. Under FIFO, the crypto assets that are bought first will be sold first. This approach assumes that the oldest cryptocurrency holdings are the ones being sold or otherwise disposed of, which makes transaction tracking easier. Let’s assume that on Jan. 1, 2023, an investor paid $30,000 to acquire 1 BTC; on May 1, 2023, they paid $50,000. The oldest purchase price — i.e., $30,000 — is automatically used as the cost basis when they sell 1 BTC.Even though FIFO is simple to implement, there are situations in which it may result in increased tax costs due to the possibility that assets with lower purchase prices would be sold, increasing capital gains and, in turn, taxes. Despite this drawback, FIFO remains a popular option for many investors because it is straightforward to apply; people who are not actively trading cryptocurrencies prefer such a method for calculating their tax liabilities.Last-in, first-out (LIFO)As opposed to FIFO, “last-in, first-out” (LIFO) assumes the crypto assets that were most recently bought will be sold first, indicating that the most recent purchase price serves as the asset’s cost basis.Let’s assume that on Jan. 1, 2023, an investor paid $30,000 to acquire 1 BTC, and on May 1, 2023, they paid $50,000. When they sell 1 BTC, the cost basis is automatically the most recent purchase price. In some circumstances, the LIFO approach may be beneficial, particularly when prices are rising. Investors may be able to reduce their capital gains and, in turn, their tax obligations by selling their most recent acquisitions first. However, in cases where the most recent assets acquired have a lower cost basis than older assets, LIFO can also result in greater taxes.Compared to FIFO, the LIFO approach is less frequently employed to determine crypto tax liabilities despite possible tax benefits. This is because LIFO may be less desirable to many investors due to its potential complexity and the need for more thorough record-keeping.Highest-in, first-out (HIFO)A strategic way for determining the cost basis of crypto holdings for taxation purposes, the “highest-in, first-out” (HIFO) method assumes that the most expensive cryptocurrency assets are sold first (in contrast to FIFO and LIFO).Investors can strategically reduce their capital gains and, thereby, their tax liability by selling their assets on the highest-cost basis first. When there is a price appreciation and the cost basis of the assets being sold is higher, this strategy is especially advantageous.To understand how the HIFO method works, let’s assume that an investor purchased 1 BTC on Jan. 1, 2023, for $30,000, followed by 1 BTC on May 1, 2023, for $50,000. When they sell 1 BTC, the cost basis is automatically the highest purchase price.Although HIFO can lead to lower capital gains taxes, it may not be a good fit for all investors, as it requires careful record-keeping. Additionally, investors should ensure they keep proper documents to back up their calculations because tax authorities may scrutinize the use of HIFO. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, investors wishing to reduce their tax obligations on crypto transactions may utilize the HIFO approach.Average cost basis (ACB) By using this technique, investors may calculate the average price of all the cryptocurrencies they own. The cost basis of the sold crypto assets is then established using this average price.Let’s assume an investor purchased 2 BTC, 1 at $30,000 (Jan. 1, 2023) and 1 at $50,000 (May 1, 2023). Their average cost basis would be calculated as follows:The average cost approach offers a middle ground between potential tax optimization and simplicity. Adopting an average price for all holdings of the same cryptocurrency makes calculating the cost base simpler. Investors who frequently buy and sell cryptocurrencies and wish to expedite their record-keeping procedures may find this strategy helpful.The average cost approach is still a popular choice among investors despite perhaps not providing the same level of tax efficiency as FIFO or HIFO, for example. While still providing a reasonable degree of accuracy in cost basis reporting, it also aids in ensuring compliance with tax requirements.Documentation required for accurate cost basis calculationIn the case of cryptocurrencies, complete transaction documentation is necessary for an accurate cost basis assessment. Investors need to maintain thorough records of the following data:Date and time of purchase: The date and time when cryptocurrency was purchased.Purchase price: The cost incurred when purchasing a cryptocurrency.Transaction fees: Any costs — e.g., gas fees — incurred while making a purchase.Type of transaction: Whether it was a purchase, sale, exchange or another type of transaction.Wallet addresses: The addresses involved in the transaction.Transaction ID: A unique identifier assigned to every transaction.Documentation is essential for tax reporting purposes to ensure compliance with tax legislation and reduce the possibility of errors or discrepancies in capital gains calculations. Furthermore, thorough record-keeping might assist investors in properly responding to any tax authorities’ audits or queries.Variations in crypto cost basis calculation among different jurisdictions Different countries use different methods to determine the cost basis of cryptocurrencies, which affects investors’ tax liabilities. The “pooled” strategy, an adaptation of the ACB method, is the most widely used technique in the United Kingdom. Using this strategy, investors calculate the average cost of all identical cryptocurrency holdings to determine the cost basis for tax purposes.The specific identification approach is commonly utilized in Canada to facilitate tax optimization. The United States permits specific identification but leans toward FIFO as the default method. A few methods are used in Australia, such as specific identification, FIFO and, in some cases, ACB. It’s important to remember that certain tax regulations can change, and seeking professional advice tailored to your jurisdiction is always the safest approach.Calculating cost basis for different types of crypto transactionsCalculating the cost basis for different types of cryptocurrency transactions requires specific considerations:Buying cryptocurrencyThe sum of money spent on purchasing a cryptocurrency serves as its cost basis. This covers the cost of the cryptocurrency and any transaction fees paid at the time of purchase.Example: The total cost basis would be $10,020 if an investor paid $10,000 for 1 BTC and a $20 transaction fee.Selling cryptocurrencyThe capital gains or losses on a cryptocurrency sale are calculated by deducting the cost basis from the selling price. The initial cryptocurrency purchase price plus any transaction fees paid at the time of purchase make up the cost basis.Example: The capital gain would be $980 if an investor sold 0.5 BTC for $7,000 and its cost basis was $6,020 (plus a $20 transaction fee).Exchanging cryptocurrency for goods or servicesThe fair market value of the cryptocurrency at the time of the exchange serves as the cost basis for trading it for goods or services. It is determined by the value of the cryptocurrency in U.S. dollars at the time of the transaction.Example: The cost basis for the transaction would be $700 if an investor traded 0.1 BTC for a $500 product, and the fair market value of 0.1 Bitcoin at the time of the exchange was $700.Receiving cryptocurrency as income or giftsThe fair market value of a cryptocurrency at the time of receipt serves as the cost basis for receiving cryptocurrency as gifts or income. Usually, the value of the cryptocurrency in U.S. dollars at the time of receipt determines this amount.Example: If an investor receives 0.2 BTC as a gift and its fair market worth is $1,300, then $1,300 would be the cost basis of the gifted Bitcoin.How to handle various crypto events for cost basis calculationHard forks and airdropsThe cost basis of new cryptocurrency obtained via hard forks and airdrops is typically regarded as $0. However, since it will be used to determine capital gains or losses when the new cryptocurrency is subsequently sold or otherwise disposed of, it is crucial to keep track of the fair market value of the cryptocurrency at the time of receipt.Example: If a hard fork or airdrop results in an investor receiving five units of a new cryptocurrency and each unit’s fair market value is $100 at the time of receipt, then $500 would be the new cryptocurrency’s cost basis.Staking and mining rewardsRewards for staking and mining are normally recognized as income at the cryptocurrency’s fair market value on the date of receipt. The fair market value becomes the cost basis for the cryptocurrency received.Example: The cost basis for the staked cryptocurrency would be $200 if an investor received five units of the cryptocurrency as a staking reward, and the fair market value of each unit at the time of receipt was $40.Crypto-to-crypto swapsThe fair market value of the cryptocurrency given up at the time of the swap is used to determine the cost basis of the new cryptocurrency acquired via a crypto-to-crypto swap. This fair market value serves as the new cryptocurrency’s cost basis.Example: If an investor swaps 2 BTC for 100 units of a different cryptocurrency and the fair market value of 2 BTC at the time of the swap is $150,000, the cost basis for the new cryptocurrency would be $150,000.Adjusting crypto cost basis for transaction fees and other costsThe cost basis of cryptocurrency assets must be adjusted for transaction fees and other associated expenses. One way to do this is to include transaction costs in the cost basis. When buying a cryptocurrency, for example, the total cost basis should include any fees paid during the transaction in addition to the asset’s purchase price. Similarly, all transaction fees related to the sale of a cryptocurrency should be deducted from the revenues.Investors should also take exchange fees and other expenses into account in addition to transaction fees. It is important to include these fees — which cryptocurrency exchanges charge for executing trades — in the total cost basis calculation. Investors can ensure that their cost basis calculations appropriately reflect the total amount invested in purchasing and disposing of crypto assets by accounting for transaction fees and other associated expenses. Benefits of using crypto tax software for accurate tax filingsFor correct tax reporting, there are a number of advantages to using crypto tax software. Firstly, it saves investors’ time and lowers the possibility of mistakes in their tax filings by automating the process of calculating capital gains and losses. These platforms can easily integrate with wallets and cryptocurrency exchanges, importing transaction data automatically and producing comprehensive reports for tax purposes.Secondly, by using the proper cost basis technique and taking transaction fees and other expenses into account, crypto tax software ensures that tax requirements are followed. By doing this, investors can reduce the possibility of audits or fines from tax authorities by appropriately disclosing their cryptocurrency transactions.These platforms also offer real-time tax estimations, which allow investors to evaluate their annual tax obligations and make well-informed decisions regarding their cryptocurrency holdings. Furthermore, many cryptocurrency tax software solutions provide tax-loss harvesting capabilities, which enable investors to optimize their tax outcomes by deliberately offsetting gains with asset sales.

This Dogecoin (DOGE) Wallet Is Shutting Down


DogeChain, a popular platform for managing Dogecoin transactions, has declared it will shut down on June 1, 2024. 
The platform urges users to quickly transfer their DOGE tokens to other wallets and secure their private keys before the shutdown.
Dogecoin (DOGE) Wallet Closure Announced
The announcement on the DogeChain website marks the end of a key service within the Dogecoin community. This platform has been essential for storing, sending, and receiving Dogecoin for several years. 
Indeed, it was more than a DOGE wallet, it was an integral part of the Dogecoin ecosystem. Operating on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and powered by Polygon (MATIC), DogeChain has provided a Layer-2 scaling solution. This setup has facilitated quicker, cost-effective transactions and expanded access to NFTs, blockchain-based games, and DeFi services for Dogecoin holders.
Now, the platform advises users to move their assets promptly to prevent any potential losses.


“Ensure you transfer your DOGE from DogeChain.info (only use the .info domain!) by June 1. Also, keep a copy of your private keys if you continue to use these addresses, as this will enable you to recover any funds accidentally sent or received in the future,” Dogecoin developer Mishaboar stated.

The decision to close the platform was part of a collective step forward for the Dogecoin community to embrace newer, more reliable, and decentralized platforms. As June 1 nears, all DogeChain users must act swiftly to secure their assets.

Massive Bitcoin Volatility, Ripple (XRP) Trial, and CZ's Sentencing: This Week's Crypto Recap


																Bitcoin’s price went on quite the wild ride throughout the past seven days. The cryptocurrency is down 4.2% during that period but this summary doesn’t do the action any justice, so let’s dive in.
The market was fairly calm in the beginning of the week, trading at around $64K with little signs of significant volatility. Things started going downhill after April 30th, however. It was then BTC took a massive hit, dropping toward $60K, sending many investors in panic.
The next day, on May 1st, BTC tumbled below $57K. This coincided with the first-ever day of IBIT ETF outflows. This is the spot Bitcoin ETF launched by BlackRock, which was up only in terms of flows until that date. The market has since been recovering, with BTC skyrocketing toward $62K today, recording gains upwards of 5% in the past 24 hours alone.
I told you things got heated up, but that’s not all.
Putting price-action aside, the industry saw a couple of major developments as well. Firs, Changpeng Zhao – the former CEO and one of Binance’s founders – finally received his sentence. He will spend 4 months in jail for violating regulations associated with anti-money laundering.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


This puts an end to a case that’s been dragged on for many months. CZ said he will do his time and move on to the next chapter of his life – education.
In another piece of news, it was reported that Bitcoin Jeasus – Roger Ver – got arrested in Spain. He is reportedly accused of tax evasion to the tune of a whopping $50 million. Ver is closely associated with Bitcoin Cash and one of the cryptocurrency’s most vocal supporters.
All in all, the BTC halving is gone and many were expecting for the prices to continue ripping. So far, this has clearly not been the case, but some analysts are pointing out that this is in line with historical price movements preceding a post-halving bull run.
Will the market pick up? Time will tell! If one thing is clear, it’s that next week will likely be just as exciting as this one!

Crypto landscape signals turbulence and dissatisfaction: IntoTheBlock - Crypto Briefing




The current crypto landscape signals turbulence and dissatisfaction from investors, according to IntoTheBlock’s “On-chain Insights” newsletter. The price drop registered by Bitcoin (BTC), the subdued impact of new Hong Kong ETFs, and the EIGEN token launch initial fiasco are the main reasons.The crypto rally this year hit a rough patch as Bitcoin’s value seesawed between $57,000 and $59,000 following the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain interest rates. Despite persistent inflation, rates remained unchanged at two-decade highs, between 5.25% and 5.5%.Moreover, Bitcoin’s value concluded April with a loss exceeding 12%, marking its first monthly decline since August 2023. IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out of the Money Around Price” indicator shows that only 37.4% of holders within the +/-15% price bracket are currently in profit, highlighting the market’s volatility.Image: IntoTheBlockThe introduction of US Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year initially spurred market growth, with BTC reaching new highs. However, the influx of new capital into these ETFs has waned, contributing to the market’s downward pressure.In contrast, Hong Kong’s recent launch of six new products holding BTC and Ethereum (ETH) had a less significant impact, with a combined trading volume of approximately $12.7 million on their debut day, compared to the $4.6 billion of the US spot ETFs.Furthermore, the Eigen Foundation’s announcement of the EIGEN token airdrop has also stirred the crypto community. With 15% of the initial 1.67 billion EIGEN tokens earmarked for community distribution, early users with accumulated “points” are set to receive the first 5% through the airdrop.Yet, the airdrop details have led to over 12,412 withdrawal requests, fueled by disappointment over restrictive policies and the token’s initial non-transferability. The full effect of these withdrawals will emerge after EigenLayer’s seven-day processing period.Image: IntoTheBlockThe crypto community backlash was so significant that Eigen Foundation reassessed the ‘stakedrop’ distribution to add more tokens to users, as the entity informed on May 2.In summary, the crypto market is experiencing volatility with Bitcoin’s price drop and . , with restrictive conditions leading to a surge in withdrawal requests. These events underscore a period of turbulence and dissatisfaction in the crypto market.

Krakenâs subsidiary is a quiet giant in Bitcoin ETF growth: Bloomberg - Crypto Briefing




Kraken’s subsidiary, CF Benchmarks, is a quiet major player in the growing popularity of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Bloomberg reported on Friday. The company provides benchmark indexes for roughly $24 billion worth of crypto ETFs, including BlackRock’s US-based Bitcoin ETF and all six of the newly launched Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong.CF Benchmarks operates by licensing its data to ETF providers, with fees that scale with the ETF’s investor base. The company claims it holds about half of the crypto benchmarking market. This dominance has placed CF Benchmarks at the heart of Bitcoin ETF growth, especially with the successful introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, which has led to increased revenue streams for the firm.CF Benchmarks CEO, Sui Chung, reported that assets for US spot-Bitcoin ETFs utilizing CF Benchmarks’ indexes have exceeded expectations, reaching more than four times the anticipated $5 billion this year. He also predicted that Hong Kong products would manage up to $1 billion by the end of 2024.Chung anticipates CF Benchmarks’ revenue to increase significantly this year and plans to expand their workforce by a third. The company is also setting its sights on new markets, including South Korea and Israel, where there is a strong affinity for digital assets and ETFs.“South Korea is a market where ETFs have become the wrapper of choice for long-term savings,” Chung said. “It is also a market where digital assets have gained a high degree of adoption.”From the US decline to Hong Kong’s modest startWhile the launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs initially drove Bitcoin’s price to a record high in March 2024, the price has faltered as investor demand for the funds has cooled. Bitcoin ETFs in the US witnessed their largest daily outflow on Wednesday, with assets under management closing at approximately $47 billion.Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s debut of spot crypto ETFs was not particularly strong. On March 2, the second day of trading, Hong Kong’s three bitcoin exchange-traded funds saw inflows of $10.3 million, based on data from SoSoValue. This figure was considerably lower compared to the first trading day, with $240 million in inflows. Trading volume on both days reached $9.7 million.However, these Hong Kong-listed spot Bitcoin funds currently hold around $238 million BTC in assets under management.

Asset Management Company Fidelity Announces Investors Who Are Favorable to Bitcoin ETFs! - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to Fidelity Digital Assets Vice President Manuel Nordeste, retirement planners are slowly warming up to the idea of investing in crypto assets.
Retirees Examine Crypto Investments, Fidelity Sees $4.7 Trillion Opportunity
Speaking at an event in London, Nordeste revealed that defined benefit plans and other pension funds have begun discussing crypto assets with their investment committees.


While the crypto market is largely dominated by small-scale but sophisticated investors such as family offices and high-net-worth individuals, larger institutional investors are starting to show interest.
Nordeste noted that Fidelity Digital Assets, founded in 2018, initially attracted interest from family offices, private asset managers and hedge funds, but is now beginning to engage larger institutional investors and companies.





A survey by Fidelity Digital Assets found that 80% of high-net-worth individuals have a positive view of digital assets, compared to just 23% of retirement plans.

Additionally, while 48% of these individuals had invested in digital assets, only 7% of their retirement plans had invested in digital assets.


Pension funds, known for their conservative strategies, are taking a cautious approach to the volatile crypto market.
Nordeste explained that unlike pensions, which require more time and specific market conditions, smaller firms can be more agile and take more risks due to their flexible investment mandates.





Fidelity rival BlackRock recently said it expects institutions, including pension funds, to begin trading in the Bitcoin spot market through exchange-traded fund (ETF) products approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in January.

Friend.tech Token Launch Turns Into A Nightmare As Price Dives 98%


                            The decentralized social network Friend.tech, launched in August 2023, is facing a significant setback as its native token, FRIEND, experiences a staggering 98.5% drop in value. 
Investors who participated in the recent airdrop of FRIEND tokens have expressed serious concerns about the development, highlighting issues with token claiming and app functionality.
Investors Hit Hard As FRIEND Token Crashes
Upon its debut, the FRIEND token entered the market with a trading price of $169 per token, attracting 18,000 holders, and boasting a circulating supply of 14 million tokens. 
However, the current trading price has plummeted to approximately $1.26, resulting in a market cap of $27.7 million and liquidity of $5.4 million, according to DexScreener data, leaving many investors frustrated.

The airdrop process, which aimed to distribute tokens to the community, has faced its fair share of challenges. Users on social media site X (formerly Twitter) expressed frustration over the declining value of their airdropped tokens. 
Some claimants experienced difficulties claiming their tokens, while others reported watching the value of their holdings diminish significantly in hours. 
One user even accused a prominent figure of orchestrating a rug pull, further fueling the community’s discontent. 
DeFi Researcher Slams Friend.tech V2 Launch
Despite the current downturn, some crypto analysts predict a potential recovery for the FRIEND token. Notably, crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades suggests that the token’s value may rise in the future, emphasizing that market sentiment may change once users start to see returns on their investments.
However, concerns remain regarding the functionality of the Friend.tech app, which experienced significant issues during its initial weeks.
DeFi researcher DeFi Ignas expressed disappointment in Friend.tech’s V2 launch, describing it as a “massive flop.” Ignas criticized the app’s usability issues and questioned whether the team’s focus was misplaced during development. Speculation arose regarding whether the team deliberately orchestrated a price decline to prompt a subsequent surge in value.

Despite this, the self-proclaimed number one creator on Friend.tech’s platform, using the pseudonym “Captain Levi,” stated the following in support of the token:
The dump is brutal but actually healthy as jeeters sell at heavily discounted prices while real users have not even waken up to the full potential of V2 and money clubs given the app barely works. think we already saw bottom and price should slowly recover as users buy clubs
As Friend.tech grapples with the challenges surrounding the FRIEND token, the crypto community eagerly awaits improvements in app functionality and a potential revival of the token’s value.

Shiba Inu Team Member Reveals ShibaSwap Network Expansion Plan That Could Send SHIB Price Flying | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu marketing lead, Lucie has announced plans that would see ShibaSwap, a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on the Ethereum blockchain expanding to a new chain. This new development could significantly transform the Shibarium ecosystem, potentially fueling a price leap for Shiba Inu’s native token, SHIB and Shibarium’s BONE.
ShibaSwap Is Going Multi-Chain
While the Shiba Inu ecosystem is still celebrating the completion of the Shibarium hardfork, Lucie has dropped a new mega development, announcing that ShibaSwap will be going multichain, operating on both the Ethereum network and the Shibarium Layer 2 network.

According to a new edition of The Shib Magazine, the integration of ShibaSwap on two prominent chains will represent a significant milestone for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, as ShibaSwap will be “enhancing rather than replacing its foundational Ethereum connections.” The decentralized exchange had initially operated solely on the Ethereum blockchain, however with the upcoming transition, ShibaSwap will be accessible on both chains, potentially improving its overall functionality and drastically reducing gas fees.
This new integration will also enable ShibaSwap to overcome the limitations of a single blockchain network, ensuring a seamless and more reliable trading experience for its growing community. Additionally, the expansion into Shibarium’s L2 network will have immense benefits on Shibarium’s ecosystem token, BONE.
Maximus, a seasoned moderator at Shiba Inu’s Tech disclosed that ShibaSwap’s integration into Shibarium will potentially reduce BONE’s substantial supply, totaling more than 249.9 million, with a circulating supply of 229.9 million.
He further clarified how the planned transition will supposedly decrease BONE’s supply, explaining that “both builders and users will need some BONE to use Shibarium while projects will acquire BONE to add liquidity for their tokens, and lock this liquidity, or even burn the liquidity tokens, locking BONE forever.” This reduction in the token’s supply is expected to improve the value of BONE, and possibly SHIB over time.
Shiba Inu Token Set For New Gains
Following the completion of Shibarium’s hard fork on April 29, the price of SHIB witnessed significant gains, surging by approximately 3.78% in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.000022, according to CoinMarketCap.

The announcement of ShibaSwap’s upcoming expansion into the Shibarium network alongside the conclusion of Shibarium’s upgrade could potentially drive new adoption and interest into the Shiba Inu ecosystem. This in turn could fuel a price increase for SHIB, enabling the popular meme coin to soar to new highs.
While speaking to The Shib Magazine, Maximus disclosed that he expects a significant increase in volume in BONE, as the transition is a change that most community members have been excited for. He revealed that Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens could potentially experience a price increase, concluding that a favorable price action will benefit the community and the ecosystem in the long run.

Betting on Solana and 'doggie coins?' Here's why this exec backs that idea - AMBCrypto



Analysts expect Fed and U.S Treasury moves to affect the market in a slow, but positive way
Hayes eyes Solana, “doggie coins” for momentum trading as liquidity improves

Market analysts expect a mild bullish impact on Bitcoin [BTC] and overall markets from the recent “dovish” Fed rate decision and the U.S Treasury QRA (Quarterly Refunding Announcement).
According to Singapore-based institutional crypto-trading firm QCP, the U.S Fed and QRA were “more dovish than expected.” It noted that, 
‘At FOMC, Powell said that the Fed is not looking to hike rates and announced the slowing of Quantitative Tightening (QT) from $60bn monthly to $25bn. For QRA, the Treasury will keep issuances for longer maturities unchanged, reducing fears of a spike in longer-term yields. This should help push down the USD rally, which is positive for risk assets.” 
BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes echoed similar sentiments, but underlined that the liquidity impact will be mild on the charts. 
“The impact of this QRA is mildly dollar liquidity positive….But it will help pump our bags slowly over time.”
Hayes eyes Solana, “doggie coins” for momentum trading
Hayes added that the current negative price movement will dampen as liquidity slowly improves each month. In fact, he expects BTC to reclaim $60k and remain range-bound within $60k-70k until August. 
That’s not all though, with the exec expecting other altcoins to perform better. For his part, Hayes is eyeing Solana [SOL], dogwifhat [WIF], Dogecoin [DOGE] for momentum trading. Part of his statement read, 
“I’m buying Solana and doggie coins for momentum trading positions.”
Momentum trading is a technique that involves buying or selling an asset that moves extremely in one direction, followed by exits when price flash reversal signs. Asset manager Franklin Templeton also has a bullish inclination towards Solana. 
However, SOL’s latest price action chalked a downtrend and revealed that short traders have profited from the market dump. It was trading at $136 at press time, down 35% from its record high of $210 in mid-March. 
However, bulls have defended the $126 short-term support twice, in mid-April and early May. Even so, a decisive trend reversal could materialize only if the price moves above the previous lower high of $160.
Additionally, Santiment data showed that overall market sentiment around SOL was still negative, as indicated by the weighted sentiment’s negative reading. So, a strong bullish reversal is unlikely in the short-term.

Apple Leads the US Buyback Resurgence, But Is it Sustainable? - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



On Thursday, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) sparked a mini-controversy with its Q2 2024 earnings report. The phone company announced the largest share buyback program in the history of the US stock market, worth $110 billion. This surpassed Apple’s own record of $100 billion buyback program announced in 2018.



Only Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) came close second at $75 billion in January 2023.



But for those who have read Apple’s deeper coverage in March, this was not surprising. The company is facing stiff competition from several fronts. South Korean Samsung and Chinese Huawei and Xiaomi arguably pose a better value for the money for most consumers.



Although Apple branched out beyond the smartphone market, it still comprises the bulk of the revenue. For Q2 2024, Apple tracked $90.8 billion net sales, a 4% decline year-over-year. Of those, the iPhone segment was responsible for $45.9 billion, or 50% of Apple’s revenue.



Moreover, Apple priced its Vision Pro entry in the AR/VR market as a luxury item, as if Meta’s Oculus Quest doesn’t exist or suffers from decades of failures to launch. Compounded with rising costs of living via inflationary pressure, Apple’s focus on a closed, premium ecosystem doesn’t bode well for growth.



However, is a record-breaking share repurchase program the right strategy to boost AAPL value? Wouldn’t that transform Apple from a growth Big Tech stock into a value stock?



It turns out, this financial novelty has its root in inflation, mirroring today’s macroeconomic landscape.



Stock Buybacks: Market Manipulation or Value Booster Driven by Macro?



Up until the early 1980s, share repurchase programs were illegal. After all, by repurchasing its own shares on the open market, the company’s insiders would have an advantage that can be construed as market manipulation.



Nonetheless, during that period of rampant inflation, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deemed it as another mechanism to return shareholder value beyond dividends. By passing Rule 10b-18 in 1982, the SEC made it a valid move to combat high inflation. This way, instead of engaging in the expense of expansion, companies can tweak their share supply so the stock price can keep up with inflation.



As the inflation rate is becoming sticky and crushing meme stocks, Goldman Sachs reported a six-year high in stock buybacks and mergers worth $625 billion this year, as of the end of March. GS analysts forecast the continuation of this trend, with S&P 500 firms ramping up share repurchases by 13% by the end of the year to $934 billion and then crossing the $1 trillion milestone in 2025.



This trend is the opposite of 2023, when there was a 13% decline in corporate buybacks. However, this was the year of recessionary concerns wherein recession was seen as the ultimate remedy for inflation at the cost of unemployment. 





Limits to Stock Buybacks



By artificially tampering with shares’ supply, much like central banks do with fiat currencies, companies create a false sense of stock demand. In the irrational waters of the stock market, this has great potential for stock overvaluation. In turn, this creates a pull-the-rug potential.



Moreover, such large expenditures to boost stock value are displacing resources for growth. Instead of investing in employees or research and development, the purpose of the company shifts to financialization. 



At a time when Apple faces antitrust charges, the company not only increased share repurchases but increased dividend payouts by 4%. Early on, in January 2019, Apple CEO Tim Cook made it clear that the company’s bottom line rests on its closed ecosystem that generates high brand loyalty.




“…my honest opinion is that there is a culture of innovation in Apple and that culture of innovation combined with these incredible, loyal customers, happy customers, this ecosystem, this virtuous ecosystem, is something that is probably underappreciated.”



Tim Cook in Mad Money with Jim Cramer interview.




If the latest antitrust lawsuit were to break those ecosystem walls, such as imposing “extraordinary costs on developers, businesses, and consumers”, Apple’s value proposition would likely lag behind buyback efforts.



In a way, just as the USG conducts record-breaking interest payments to pay for its money supply tampering, instead of building great projects, Apple may find itself in a similar bind. 







Do you think Apple will engender more shareholder loyalty in the future, as a value stock, or will this dynamic eventually burn out?

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Hits $62K as DOGE, SHIB, NEAR Lead Crypto Bounce After Soft Jobs Data

Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, said in his latest essay early Friday that bitcoin has likely bottomed at this week's lows of $56,000, but warned investors to expect a gradual climb instead of a swift recovery to the March highs as markets will cool for the next few months. "Did bitcoin hit a local low [...] earlier this week," asked Hayes. "Yes," he concluded. "I expect prices to bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher."

Opinion: Gemini wants you to vote for anti-democracy politicians


Gemini, the exchange that sent about a billion dollars into Genesis before it shut down withdrawals, has now partnered with ‘Stand With Crypto,’ a tool that will make it easier for Gemini to encourage its users to vote for certain politicians. 
Stand With Crypto has previously partnered with other crypto firms, including Coinbase, to make sure as many users as possible are encouraged to vote for these politicians.
Politicians endorsed by the service include Cynthia Lummis, the senator who attempted to interfere with the peaceful transition of power following the 2020 election. She gets an ‘A.’

Read more: Coinbase: Politics for me, but not for thee
A number of other politicians who wanted to make sure people’s votes were not counted also received high grades from the service, which is used by Coinbase, Gemini, Paradigm, Paxos, Anchroage, Blockchain dot com, and more.
These politicians include Ted Cruz, Tommy Tuberville, Jim Banks, Ted Budd, Tim Burchett, and Ben Cline.
The endorsement of these politicians becomes even more objectionable when you actually click on their names. Guy Reschenthaler gets a ‘supportive of crypto’ grade, but it also says, “Guy Reschenthaler has made 0 statements about crypto.” 
Speaking of interfering with the peaceful transition of power, we also see this service endorse Donald Trump, a sexual abuser, with a ‘B.’ This would be the same Trump who once said, “Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam,” and who once stated that the value of cryptocurrencies was “based on thin air.”
Trump has also been indicted for his fake state elector scheme in which many of the aforementioned politicians were complicit.
The crypto industry is very happy to endorse more than two dozen candidates who took serious steps to permanently change the ability for American votes to be counted, all to keep an authoritarian sexual abuser in power.

It signifies that Coinbase is bound to gain from the increasing trade volumes and transaction fees.However, Coinbase strongly depends on the market prices of crypto assets and the transaction volumes on its platform. This positions the company in a marginal risk position. Notwithstanding, Coinbase has shown the ability to implore creative ways to mitigate these risks and diversify its revenue sources. By implementing such a business strategy, the company was positively rewarded, with growth in subscription services revenues of 122% in the first quarter of 2024 only. Custodial fee revenue jumped by 90% to $32.341 million, primarily due to Coinbase’s role as the custodian of one-quarter of all bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) set up and listed in the United States over the given period.Navigating market uncertaintyDespite Coinbase’s central role in the crypto industry’s success, the question of whether this business model is durable during volatile times of changing markets still exists.

Thus, the organization continues to conduct due diligence on all macroeconomic environments and tailors its approaches to prevent losses.Ahead, Coinbase hopes that its update will expand the company’s performance into quarters, where the results of the next quarter will be in line with the previously stated upward surge.

Hong Kong's Virtual Asset ETF Trading Surges, Analysts Warn of Challenges Ahead


							

Hong Kong ETFs face challenges in matching the scale and dominance of US counterparts.



Analysts project moderate inflows for Hong Kong’s ETFs, cautioning against unrealistic expectations.



Hong Kong’s spot ETFs for virtual assets surged on May 3, led by Bitcoin ETFs with HK$43.41 million in trading volume.





The Hong Kong market reported an increase in trading volumes for spot ETFs associated with virtual assets on May 3. The overall trading volume came to HK$48.91 million, with Ethereum ETFs coming in second at HK$5.5 million and Bitcoin ETFs dominating at HK$43.41 million. On May 2, for instance, trading volume for US Bitcoin spot ETFs reached an astounding $1.72 billion, indicating a notable divergence in market activity.







The approval of spot Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has generated enthusiasm, but analysts are cautious about the possible inflows. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, projects moderate inflows of about $500 million, but he believes the Hong Kong market may struggle to reach the size of its US rivals.







Balchunas attributes this conservative estimate to several factors. Firstly, Hong Kong’s ETF market, valued at $50 billion, is relatively small compared to the US market. Moreover, restrictions on Chinese locals purchasing these ETFs limit potential demand. Additionally, the absence of major players like BlackRock in Hong Kong’s ETF landscape may hinder significant investments.



In addition, the Hong Kong market’s underlying ecosystem is thought to be less efficient and accessible than the US market, which causes premium discounts and larger spreads for exchange-traded funds. Additionally, investors used to lower-cost choices in the US may be put off by the relatively higher fees (1% to 2%) attached to Hong Kong ETFs, as noted by Balchunas.



Despite the anticipation surrounding the approval of ETFs in Hong Kong, Bitcoin is trading at $59,112.26, experiencing a growth of 0.73% in the last 24 hours. While Hong Kong ETFs may hold potential in the long run, they are unlikely to match the scale and dominance of their US counterparts upon launch.

CFTC Commissioner wants to create AI Fraud Task Force

United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Kristin Johnson recently advanced three proposals for the regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies as they apply to U.S. financial markets. Speaking at the Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) meeting held on May 2, Johnson laid out the CFTC’s three-pronged agenda consisting of the establishment of a “principles-based framework” to assess the risks associated with integrating AI into financial markets, heightened penalties the intentional misuse of AI, and the creation of a task force to “evaluate, assess, and harmonize guidance, supervision, and regulation that addresses the increasing integration of AI in financial markets.”While government calls for the creation of investigatory task forces and common-sense risk assessment platforms are nothing new, Johnson’s assertion that crimes committed with the use of AI should be given “heightened penalties” would pose significant changes to the existing legal framework. Johnson cited a previous speech given by U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, who’d said that “guns enhance danger, so when they’re used to commit crimes, sentences are more severe. Like a firearm, AI can also enhance the danger of a crime.”Per Johnson, the advent of AI technologies and their potential for misuse should be treated in a similar manner:“To address these concerns, the Commission should introduce heightened penalties for those who intentionally use AI technologies to engage in fraud, market manipulation, or the evasion of our regulations. Bad actors who would use AI to violate our rules must be put on notice and sufficiently deterred from using AI as a weapon to engage in fraud, market manipulation, or to otherwise disrupt the operations or integrity of our markets.”The commissioner’s speech comes on the heels of the CFTC’s appointment of its first Chief AI Officer, Ted Kaouk. Kaouk’s previous role within the CFTC was as its Chief Data Officer and Director of the Division of Data.Source: @FSCDems on X. Meanwhile, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, recently penned a letter to U.S. president Joseph Biden recommending Johnson be nominated for the position of Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. If nominated and approved, Johnson would play a key role in instituting legislation and policies related to the U.S. financial market.

Heavily followed crypto trader Cold Blooded Shiller shared his thoughts on Bitcoin’s BTC/USD short-term prospects, expressing skepticism about reclaiming the $62,000 mark.What Happened: In his latest tweet, Shiller expressed his belief that despite the positive momentum, the $62,000 mark still represents a bearish retest for the world’s largest cryptocurrency.He also highlighted the potential for further upside, stating, "The good news is, if it does reclaim, we’ve got the green light for more madness." This sentiment suggests that a successful breach of the $62,000 resistance could open the doors for a continued rally in the Bitcoin market.The trader also took the opportunity to check in with his followers, asking, "The other good news is if it does reject you all made lots of money in this bounce, right?"Looking ahead, Cold Blooded Shiller shared his personal opinion on the likelihood of Bitcoin reclaiming the $62,000 level, stating, "I think if $62k is reclaimed that’s the correction done.

New Bitcoin ETF Decision from SEC as Bitcoin Surges After Weak Data from the US - Bitcoin Sistemi


The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it has postponed its decision on the proposed 7RCC Spot Bitcoin and Carbon Credit Futures ETF. The agency said it needed additional time to evaluate next steps for ETFs focused on carbon credit futures contracts and Bitcoin.
In its statement, the SEC announced that it would make a decision to “approve or disapprove or initiate action” for the ETF by June 24, 2024. The Commission stated that a longer period of time was needed to take action on the proposed rule change, ensuring it had sufficient time to evaluate the results.



According to past filings, the proposed fund plans to allocate 80% of its assets to Bitcoin and 20% to financial instruments, including swap agreements that provide exposure to Carbon Credit Futures represented by the index.
The S-1 registration statement for the spot BTC and carbon credit futures ETF was filed on December 18, 2023, about a month before the SEC approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs.





Hong Kong's ETF launches also came right after Bitcoin's halving event. However, these ETFs failed to deliver the expected boom effect.
Bitcoin price increased by nearly 5% during the day as non-farm employment data from the USA remained weak and was traded at $ 61,759 at the time of writing this article.

BTC optimism as institutional investors report millions in Bitcoin ETFs ownership


This year marked a significant shift in the investment landscape, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved nine spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. This development has opened a pathway for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) through familiar investment vehicles, integrating cryptocurrency into the mainstream financial market.
In a notable display of confidence in cryptocurrencies, Hong Kong-based asset managers have invested a substantial $112 million in US spot Bitcoin ETFs as per new data by Eric Balchunas  Senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg.

Hong Kong asset managers show strong support for US Bitcoin ETFs
Hong Kong-based Yong Rong Asset Management has made a significant investment by purchasing $38 million worth of BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust, which now comprises 12.14% of its total holdings. 


The portfolio of Yong Rong features a mix of high-tech and cryptocurrency assets, including stocks such as  Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)  alongside Bitcoin, creating what’s commonly known as the “LFG Portfolio.” According to the data, Yong Rong Asset Management has the highest single ETF investment at $30 million in IBIT.
Another Hong Kong firm, Ovata Capital Management, has also significantly invested in this asset class by acquiring stakes in four different spot Bitcoin ETFs, totaling over $74 million. These ETFs, managed by major financial institutions including Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, and BlackRock, highlight Ovata’s strategic diversification within this asset class.
Notably, Ovata has become the largest allocator in Bitcoin ETFs to date, with four out of its five biggest holdings in this category. This burgeoning interest arrives just as Hong Kong has started to embrace Bitcoin and Ethereum investment offerings, yet the global appeal of US ETFs continues to draw significant capital from overseas investors.
The strategic moves by Yong Rong and Ovata signify a strong institutional endorsement of Bitcoin as a viable component of diversified investment portfolios.

Recently, BlackRock’s IBIT reported its first-ever outflows, totaling $37 million. James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg, speculated that Yong Rong Asset Management may be moving its investments from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF to a Hong Kong-based spot Bitcoin ETF, potentially driving these outflows.
The Bitcoin market has shown remarkable resilience recently, with the price of Bitcoin recovering to over $61,000. The continued embrace of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) offerings by Hong Kong, coupled with the sustained appeal of US ETFs globally, cements a strong institutional endorsement for Bitcoin.
This evolving enthusiasm signifies a broader acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial landscape, promising an exciting future for investors navigating this digital frontier.

Wasabi Wallet To Eliminate Coinjoin Amid U.S. Regulatory Fears - The Defiant

The move follows U.S. authorities targeting privacy protocols and non-custodial wallets.Wasabi Wallet, a popular Bitcoin wallet, will no longer offer its Coinjoin feature, a service providing privacy for on-chain transactions.Announced on May 2, ZkSNACKS, the development team behind Wasabi Wallet, said it will discontinue support for Coinjoin transactions from June 1. The team alluded to increasing regulatory hostility towards cryptocurrency privacy protocols from U.S. authorities as the primary motivation behind its decision.“After years of relentless dedication to improve Bitcoin’s privacy, zkSNACKs… is shutting down its Coinjoin coordination service,” the blog post said. "We have always made efforts to operate under legal clarity. At this point, we need to regain more certainty before moving forward.”Moving forward, the Wasabi wallet will solely function as a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet without offering Coinjoin transactions, meaning users can continue to create wallets and transfer assets using the protocol.“Wasabi Wallet is a free and open-source software and will continue to be maintained,” zkSNACKS said.Coinjoin describes a process combining multiple Bitcoin transactions to obfuscate the flow of funds and provide privacy to users transacting on-chain. The technique was first articulated by Greg Maxwell, an early Bitcoin developer, in 2013.“A Coinjoin is a special Bitcoin transaction where several peers get together to literally join their coins in a single transaction,” Wasabi’s documentation said. “The goal is to gain privacy by breaking the link of which input ‘pays’ which output so that none of the outputs can be attributed to the owner of the input.”Third-party wallet clients that previously offered Coinjoin transactions via Wasabi will also be unable to offer the service, including the popular hardware wallet, Trezor, and the payment processor, BTCPay.War on privacyWasabi’s decision to abandon its Coinjoin features comes as on-chain privacy protocols are increasingIn August 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department took the unprecedented action of adding Tornado Cash, a popular Ethereum-based privacy protocol, to its sanctions list, making it illegal for U.S. residents to interact with Tornado Cash. The move came in response to Lazarus Group, the North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, increasingly adopting Tornado Cash as a means to launder stolen crypto assets.In November, the Treasury Department followed up by sanctioning Sinbad, another cryptocurrency mixer implicated in enabling North Korean money laundering activities. “Mixing services that enable criminal actors, such as the Lazarus Group, to launder stolen assets will face serious consequences,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, Wally Adeyemo.On April 24, the U.S. Department of Justice charged the two founders of the popular privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet Samourai with money laundering and unlicensed money-transmitting offenses. The DoJ accuses the pair of facilitating $2 billion in illicit transactions and laundering $100 million in criminal proceeds from darknet marketplaces. They now face sentences of up to 20 years and five years imprisonment respectively.Non-custodial crackdown?ZkSNACKS’ move to discontinue Coinjoin also follows the project blocking U.S. residents from accessing its website and wallet on April 27.The team attributed the move to concerns of a broader crackdown on non-custodial wallets from U.S. authorities. ZkSNACKS alluded to the Wells Notice that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued to Consensys, the company behind the popular MetaMask wallet on April 26. A Wells Notice proceeds the filing of a formal legal complaint.“In light of recent announcements by U.S. authorities,zkSNACKs is now strictly prohibiting U.S. users from using its services,” zkSNACKS said.On April 26, Acinq, the developer of Phoenix Wallet, similarly announced its decision to exit the U.S. market. Acinq said the wallet will no longer be accessible via U.S. app stores starting May 3.

Bitcoin on Track To Explode by Over 1,500%, According to On-Chain Analyst Willy Woo - Here’s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								On-chain analyst Willy Woo believes Bitcoin (BTC) is on track to increase by over 1,500% based on one main driver.
Woo tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that increasing adoption of Bitcoin could drive the top-performing digital asset to $1 million within 11 years.










According to Woo, there is a historic correlation between Bitcoin’s value and the the number of Bitcoin users, which he expects to continue to increase based on his growth curve model.
“On track for $1 million per BTC as ‘fair value’ by 2035. That’s if we take the user growth curve as a guide for valuation. Remember I said fair value and not peak value in bull market hype. 

In the early days price was slow to catch up to user count. BTC didn’t even have a price until the 1000th user came in. Thanks to the blockchain we have a high resolution view of users using forensic clustering of addresses into entities. 
Price discovery started with early markets like New Liberty Standard and Mt. Gox. By Aug 2011 Bitstamp launched and we had multiple global exchanges to properly price the asset. (shaded region below). 
After 2012 price pretty much oscillated around the increasing user count.”

Source: Willy Woo/X
Woo believes that Bitcoin is still early on in adoption, comparing the asset to the Internet’s adoption rate.
“Bitcoin is at 4.7% world adoption, this is the same as January 1999 for Internet adoption. You are still early and that’s backed by the best data available.”

ZKasino $32M Scam Suspect Arrested: Here’s What We Know - DailyCoin


        
Dutch authorities arrest 26-year-old in connection to ZKasino scam.



Over 11 million euros in assets were confiscated.



Further arrests and asset recovery efforts are underway.
The recent case involving the ZKasino platform highlights the darker side of crypto. A supposed investment opportunity in a blockchain casino turned into a $32 million fraud. On Friday, May 3, Dutch authorities revealed an arrest of a man linked to the ZKasino platform, amid allegations of an exit scam. platform, which had been presented as a lucrative investment opportunity in the online gambling arena, is now accused of a rug pull. The ZKasino Fraudster Arrested, $11M SeizedOn Monday, April 29, the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) arrested a 26-year-old suspect linked to a cryptocurrency scam involving ZKasino, an online gambling platform. This platform, which portrayed itself as a legitimate investment opportunity, is now at the center of an investigation following reports of $32 million in stolen funds from investors.
The arrest followed a series of events, starting with investigations on April 25, sparked by user complaints and intelligence reports. The authorities executed a raid and seized assets worth approximately 11.4 million euros, including high-value items such as real estate, luxury cars, and various cryptocurrencies.Investigations have revealed that ZKasino’s operations were likely a “rug pull,” meaning that developers just took off with investors’ funds. The smart contract associated with ZKasino was reportedly configured to make it appear that investors would receive a return on their investments within 30 days. However, this setup was a facade to mislead investors. In an effort to crack down on this fraud, the FIOD collaborated with Binance’s Financial Crime Compliance and Investigations Team. The authorities have made it clear that returning the seized assets to the victims is a priority, which requires cooperation from those involved in the fraud. Further arrests and investigative actions have not been ruled out as the inquiry progresses.
The FIOD has also reached out to the public, urging victims of the scam to come forward and provide information that could assist in the ongoing investigations and eventual prosecution of additional suspects involved in the scam.ZKasino Raised Alarms Over Potential Rug PullOn April 22, reports surfaced of the potential ZKasino exit scam following its mainnet launch. Namely, investors have reported unauthorized token swaps and restricted withdrawal access. Initially, ZKasino promised to refund investors with Ethereum but unexpectedly swapped these for its own $ZKAS tokens. Further complicating matters, these funds were then transferred to a staking protocol, contradicting their previous statements about refunding investors directly.The controversy has led to several exchanges and platforms postponing or canceling their plans to list $ZKAS tokens, citing suspicious activities.Unlike traditional online casinos, which are heavily regulated to protect consumers, many blockchain-based casinos exist outside of strict regulatory oversight. This often leads to an increased risk of fraud and scams.On the Flipside
Binance has a long track record of collaborating with authorities against scammers. In early May, the firm worked with Indian authorities to arrest those responsible for a $10 million pig butchering scam. 



Despite several high-profile cases, crypto hacks and scams are consistently trending lower.
Why This MattersThe ZKasino scam underscores the critical need for more sophisticated security measures in crypto, especially in online gambling. As these platforms continue to grow, ensuring the safety of investor funds is essential for maintaining trust in crypto.Read more about the clues pointing to a Zkasino rug pull: Why ZKasino Mainnet Launch Is Stirring FUD Among InvestorsRead more about MicroStrategy’s big plans for Bitcoin: MicroStrategy Takes on Worldcoin ID With Bitcoin Inscriptions

$133,163,900,000 in Deposits Exit US Banking System in One Week As Former Fed President Warns Lenders Are Vulnerable - The Daily Hodl


								People are once again pulling their money out of the US banking system.
The latest data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) system shows total deposits in all commercial banks fell $133.163 billion in seven days, from $17.580 trillion on April 10th to $17.446 trillion on April 17th.










The new numbers have erased gains that banks made at the start of this year, and total deposits remain below the industry’s all-time high of $18.205 trillion, which was reached right before last year’s banking crisis began.
Amid the backdrop of another bank failure last week, the industry at large continues to battle high interest rates from the Fed, unrealized losses on US bonds, competition from money market funds and concern about exposure to commercial real estate.
Former Kansas Fed president Thomas Hoenig warns in a new interview with David Lin that 722 US banks are still at risk of failure due to massive unrealized losses.
Explains Hoening,
“I think [the banks are] very vulnerable to the fact that we still have interest rates that are much higher than they were when a lot of these loans were made, when the policy rate, the Fed funds rate was close to zero. Now it’s almost 5.5%. Those conditions of higher rates have not changed.
When they say the unrealized losses, it’s across the loan and investment portfolio.
Those regional banks that failed last year were really involved with losses in their credit risk-free, government and government-guaranteed assets. They were taking these very huge reductions in the value of those assets in terms of real value. But they did not have to mark them down because they were so-called ‘hold to maturity’ assets or as available for sale for certain banks did not have to be written down at one time. 
Once you sell any part of that, you have to write the whole portfolio down, and that’s why there are potential losses.”
In December, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) reported that US banks were holding $684 billion in unrealized losses.
And Hoening says lenders are now at greater risk of realizing those losses with borrowers increasingly failing to make payments amid a high interest rate environment.
“You see that in the call reports of banks – the income and call reports of banks across the nation. You see non-performing loans rising pretty substantially by three times what they were. They’ve had to add to their loan loss reserves to try and shore up the bank’s balance sheet behind those weak loans.
Those are all in play and with interest rates remaining large, a lot of these loans are now just starting to reprice – these commercial real estate loans. 
Now the question is: can the borrower, instead of having a cap rate of 5% or 6%, have a cap rate of 9% or 10% and still make that work? 
So the industry is vulnerable. The Fed knows that, and I think the market investors know that as well.”

Fidelity Reveals Pension Funds Are Exploring Crypto - The Defiant

The exploration is still in its very early stages, said Fidelity’s VP of Digital Assets.Pension funds are cozying up to crypto.WatcherGuru reported that Manuel Nordeste, Fidelity’s VP of digital assets, said in an event that pension funds “are only starting to talk to their investment committees” about crypto assets.The move has the potential to mobilize trillions in capital towards the digital asset industry. According to a 2023 report by the OECD, the 87 top pension funds alone had $9.8 trillion in investments in 2022.Nordeste isn’t the only top-level Wall Street executive that believes trillions are waiting to flood the crypto market.Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, predicted $1 trillion to enter the digital asset space thanks to the astounding success of the spot Bitcoin ETFs. “The January launch of spot bitcoin ETFs opened up the crypto market to investment professionals in a major way for the first time ever,” wrote Hougan in an internal memo on April 1.Fidelity Has Been Pioneering Crypto and TradFiFidelity Investments has been spearheading the crossroads of traditional finance and crypto.In the midst of the grueling bear market in 2018, the firm–which handles $4.9 trillion in assets under management–opened its digital asset arm, and has since deployed billions across the market.FBTC is one of the most favored spot Bitcoin ETFs for investors, trailing only Grayscale’s GBTC and Blackrock’s IBIT in terms of total onchain holdings. A Dune dashboard reports Fidelity holding 147,955 BTC or $9.1 billion on behalf of its clients (translating to 17% of the total sector), with GBTC holding 291,969 BTC and IBIT showcasing 273,825 bitcoin.The firm has also been paving the way for broader institutional crypto adoption. It applied for a spot Ethereum ETF which would also include a staking option for its clients. However, the SEC has repeatedly delayed giving a verdict, causing experts to estimate a 50-50 chance of approval by the May 23 deadline.

Battle For Privacy: DOJ Targets Crypto Wallets, Stirring Major Concerns Over Digital Rights


								The recent actions of the US Department of Justice (DOJ) have ignited a fierce debate on the future of financial privacy.
The crackdown on Wasabi Wallet’s service has raised significant concerns among privacy advocates and crypto users alike, spotlighting the tension between regulatory actions and the right to private digital transactions.

A Blow To Privacy: DOJ Targets Wasabi Wallet
Wasabi Wallet, known for its privacy-focused features, recently announced the shutdown of its Coinjoin coordination service. This service was integral to enhancing user anonymity by mixing details of multiple transactions to obscure the trail back to the fund’s original source.
The decision came after heightened scrutiny from the DOJ, which has increasingly focused on privacy tools under the guise of preventing illicit financial activities. This action has not only disrupted service operations but also sparked a broader conversation about privacy rights in the digital realm.
Naomi Brockwell, a vocal cryptocurrency advocate, expressed her dismay on X, emphasizing that financial privacy is fundamental to a free society. Her sentiments echo a growing discomfort among digital users and privacy proponents who view such regulatory measures as “overly intrusive” and “detrimental” to personal freedoms.

The Reaction From The Crypto Community
The response from the crypto community was swift and pointed, with notable figures like Edward Snowden weighing in on the implications for Bitcoin’s future. Snowden, a long-time advocate for privacy rights, criticized the slow progress on enhancing privacy features within the Bitcoin network.
His comments reflect a frustration with the ongoing vulnerability of cryptocurrencies to potential government oversight and interference.
Snowden also underscored the urgency for developers to innovate and implement strong privacy solutions that could withstand governmental pressures.
He pointed out that the technological capability exists but the implementation has lagged, leaving users exposed and the promise of decentralized financial systems unfulfilled. Snowden noted in a post on X:
I’ve been warning Bitcoin developers for ten years that privacy needs to be provided for at the protocol level. This is the final warning. The clock is ticking.
Meanwhile, the implications of the DOJ’s actions extend beyond Wasabi Wallet. So far, the US DOJ appears to be on a trend of increased regulatory interventions in the cryptocurrency space.

Recently, following the enforcement measures against Tornado Cash and Binance, the DOJ recently initiated a lawsuit against KuCoin, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, for multiple regulatory violations, including breaches of anti-money laundering laws in the United States.

Crypto Pundit Lists 4 Altcoins To Buy Once The Bitcoin Price Bottoms


                            Crypto analyst DonAlt has listed four altcoins he will buy once he believes that Bitcoin’s price has bottomed. The analyst further provided insights into why he is particularly bullish on these altcoins. 
Ethereum Is Number One On The Altcoins List
DonAlt mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he will buy “ETH, DOGE, LTC, and maybe PEPE” whenever he believes BTC has bottomed. In a video posted on his YouTube channel, he gave insights into why he was bullish on these crypto tokens, especially Ethereum.

The crypto analyst mentioned that Ethereum is now low enough for him to be comfortable with buying. He also suggested that the crypto token was likely a good buy at this price level, stating that it is currently having a good price action (especially on the weekly chart) with Bitcoin struggling. 
DonAlt added that Ethereum will likely experience a good breakout as Bitcoin struggles and that its underperformance could be over soon. However, DonAlt hasn’t bought Ethereum yet. He revealed that he will bet on Ethereum if Bitcoin reclaims $62,000. 
The analyst further suggested that Bitcoin reclaiming this level would determine whether or not the bottom was in. To support his stance, he noted that many altcoins are struggling to hold their support levels due to Bitcoin’s breakdown. However, if Bitcoin were to reclaim $62,000, the rest of the market would likely pick up, too. 
Meanwhile, DonAlt remarked that Ethereum could move to $4,000 if it manages to close above $3,000 on its weekly chart. He further stated that this is the most bullish he has been on the second-largest crypto token in years. 
Why Dogecoin (DOGE) And Pepe (PEPE)
DonAlt didn’t give an exact reason why he was looking to buy Litecoin other than the fact that it is an old coin. However, he gave insights into why he was bullish on the other two altcoins, Dogecoin and Pepe. 

According to him, the foremost meme coin is still likely to reach $1 if Bitcoin hasn’t topped out, which presents an opportunity to make a lot of money. Interestingly, he had previously claimed that Dogecoin was a better investment than Bitcoin. He also revealed that he is waiting for Dogecoin to drop to around $0.11 before buying, although he is still comfortable with buying around $0.15 if it doesn’t. 
Meanwhile, as to why he is bullish on Pepe, he suggested that the meme coin was a good buy because of its recent performance. He went as far as comparing it to Dogwifhat (WIF) and claimed that he would pick Pepe over it because Pepe is on a “non-joke-like chain” (Ethereum), unlike WIF, which is a “meme on a meme chain” (Solana).

Is Bitcoin price's bottom in? Key signs from its 84.4% finding say... - AMBCrypto



The percentage of BTC supply in profit has declined by 15% since 5 March
Coin’s Age Consumed and Network Realized Profit/Loss metrics refuted claims of a price bottom

The percentage of Bitcoin [BTC] supply in profit has dropped to a two-month low of 84.4%, according to Santiment’s latest update on X (Formerly known as Twitter). 
In fact, according to the on-chain data provider, figures for the same rallied to a year-to-date peak of 99.93% on 5 March. However, it has since fallen on the charts. 
Source: Santiment
When this ratio declines in this manner, it means that an increasing portion of BTC investors hold their coins at a loss. This often happens when BTC’s price see a slight correction and short-term holders who bought relatively recently at higher prices panic and begin to sell their holdings.
In its post, Santiment assessed the metric’s historical performance and concluded that “lower levels generally justify more bullish conditions.”
This, because a low supply-in-profit ratio can be viewed as a contrarian indicator. When it falls, it indicates that weak/paper hands have been removed from the market, making way for new demand in the market. A declining supply-in-profit ratio could signal that an asset’s price is approaching its bottom, as there are fewer sellers left in the market.
Is the bottom in?
To assess whether BTC’s price has reached its bottom and if a rally is next, a key metric to consider is the coin’s Age Consumed. This metric tracks the movement of its long-held idle coins. This metric is deemed to be a good marker of assets’ local price tops and bottoms because long-term holders rarely move their dormant coins around. As such, when they do, it is noteworthy as it often results in major shifts in market trends.
When this metric rises, it signals that a significant number of previously held idle tokens have begun to change addresses.

Conversely, when it falls, it means that long-held coins remain in wallet addresses without being traded.  
According to Santiment, BTC’s Age Consumed has been relatively flat since 3 April, suggesting that there has not been any significant movement of dormant coins, which could have marked a local bottom. 
Another important metric to consider is BTC’s Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL). It tracks the difference between the price at which coins were last moved on the blockchain and their current market price. Historically, NPL declines are a marker for when an asset has reached a local bottom. This, because when these dips happen, they signal the short-term capitulation of ‘weak hands’ and the re-entry of new money into the market. 
As per the same, there is no indication that a price bottom has been reached on the charts yet.

Saga Reveals First ‘Power-Level Over 9,000’ Airdrop With $10 Million in Tokens - Decrypt

Saga, a layer-1 blockchain with a focus on gaming, recently built up a ton of hype for its mainnet and token launch by running a play-to-airdrop campaign and rewarding DeFi stakers across various networks. But the incentives don't stop there. Saga is now rolling out its next wave with a colorfully-titled campaign.The “Power-Level Over 9,000” airdrop campaign—named after a “Dragon Ball Z” reference that became an internet meme—was first revealed in April and leans on partnerships with more than 100 projects across various chains, Saga says, including games and other decentralized apps.The campaign will dole out bundles of crypto tokens and NFTs from those partners to SAGA holders who stake their tokens within the network. On Thursday, Saga revealed that it has already taken the first snapshot of SAGA token stakers for the initial wave of reward “vaults” that will be sent to eligible users.The snapshot was taken on April 26 at block 262,311 for the Saga network, and the network will ultimately award 3 million SAGA—some $10.2 million worth at the current price of $3.40—to wallets that meet the criteria.Any SAGA user who staked more than 101 SAGA (over $340 worth at current price), or anyone who staked at least 95% of their SAGA genesis airdrop from the April 9 mainnet launch, will earn a share of the rewards. Genesis airdrop recipients who staked at least 95% of the initial drop will also get a 4x “loyalty bonus” for holding and staking their tokens.It’s not yet clear when Saga will distribute these initial “vaults” of token rewards, though the network’s team added that a claims page will be opened roughly one week ahead of the distribution. Furthermore, the “first few vaults will be used to refine eligibility criteria” ahead of the broader planned slate of partner airdrops.According to SAGA, more than 30 million tokens went unclaimed from the genesis airdrop, so this first vault drop represents approximately 10% of the remaining stash that will now be used for incentives. Another 110 million network tokens have been allocated for airdrops and rewards, the blog post reads.Furthermore, Saga previously said that it has lined up more than 100 partner projects across chains to contribute tokens and NFTs for future drops. Announced partners include the Avalanche-based first-person shooter Shrapnel, as well as Ethereum games The Sandbox and Wilder World.Saga is billed as a “layer-1 to launch layer-1s,” which means that the network is designed to let projects deploy their own dedicated chains rather than having everything built on a single mainnet. It’s also designed complement other chains, letting projects build across networks and tap into Saga’s “chainlets” structure as needed to support their apps.While not exclusively focused on gaming, some 80% of testnet projects were focused on gaming, and Saga used gaming competitions as a way to hand out airdrop allocations.Furthermore, the team has launched its own in-house game publishing division called Saga Origins, which plans to release games that are “provocative, expansive, [and] uncompromising,” as CEO and co-founder Rebecca Liao told Decrypt’s GG in April.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Crypto Markets Surge on U.S. Jobs Report - The Defiant

U.S. jobs report missed expectations, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.9%.
Crypto markets rose on Friday morning following the release of the US government's jobs report for April.Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, was trading around $61,800 — a 4.6% rise over 24 hours, at 1:30pm EST. Ether (ETH) was trading at over $3,000, and Dogecoin (DOGE) climbed by 4%. Solana and Avalanche also saw increases of 3%, according to CoinGecko.This surge in the crypto market on Friday can be attributed to several factors, one of which is the Federal Reserve's less aggressive stance on monetary policy and the news of PayPal's integration with MoonPay.Justin Berett, a crypto analyst, told The Defiant that when a big player in the finance sector like PayPal embraces crypto services, it lends credibility to the crypto market.“This legitimacy can attract traditional investors and the general public, who might have previously been skeptical about cryptocurrencies, to recognize and potentially engage with this asset class,” he said.Jobs ReportAccording to the government's Nonfarm Payrolls report released Friday morning, the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in April. This figure falls short of economist forecasts for 243,000 jobs and March's 315,000.The unemployment rate for April was 3.9%, slightly higher than forecasts for 3.8% and March's 3.8%.Weaker than expected economic data fuels speculation the Fed will ease its monetary policy, which usually leads to increased risk appetite.The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the surge with a 1.5% gain while the S&P 500 also surged by 1.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite rallied by 1.8%.Company EarningsMeanwhile, Coinbase Global, a major cryptocurrency exchange, reported making profits for the second consecutive quarter thanks to a rise in crypto trading during the first three months of 2024. Despite this robust financial performance, pre-market trading on Friday saw almost a 4% decrease in the company's stock value.In other news, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey announced that his financial company Block, Inc. plans to invest 10% of its Bitcoin product profits into purchasing Bitcoin every month."Going forward, each month we will be investing 10% of our gross profit from Bitcoin products into Bitcoin purchases," Dorsey stated in a shareholder letter, which also reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter.Block's first-quarter results, saw 60% increase in Bitcoin gross profit to $80.1 million from customer sales through its Cash App business. Following this news, Block's stock rose by 6.19% after hours trading on Friday.

Why tracking bitcoin ETF flows matters. And why it doesn’t. - Blockworks


Those keeping tabs on the crypto industry (this writer included) have been quick to refresh pages of daily bitcoin ETF flow data and digest them.
News headlines have kept segment observers up to date on the money going into, and more recently leaving, these funds. 
The pent-up angst over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s long term refusal to approve spot bitcoin ETFs left many speculating about the potential investor capital these products would attract out of the gate. 
There were also considerations about whether this demand would be enough to spur further interest, in order to draw both retail and institutional investors, along with their capital, into the crypto space.
We now have the initial data to answer some of these pressing questions.
On day one, the funds tallied trading volumes of $4.5 billion, and $655 million of net inflows. By two months in, after the category welcomed $1 billion in assets on March 12 alone, the funds’ inflows amounted to $11.1 billion.
The total stands at about the same level today as momentum has slowed in recent weeks.   
Continued GBTC outflows have coincided with stalled demand for the category’s most consistent flow-gatherers: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC). 
And in an unprecedented turn Wednesday, 10 of the funds — including those by BlackRock and Fidelity — each saw outflows, spurring a $564 million exodus on the day.
Read more: BlackRock, Fidelity bitcoin ETFs bleed Wednesday, joining GBTC
With this background established, we can now zoom out to examine the broader implications of bitcoin ETF flows.
Bitcoin ETF flow impact 
Because bitcoin is a speculative investment, inflows and outflows typically dictate price moves, said Bryan Armour, director of North America passive strategies research at Morningstar.  
After all, bitcoin ETFs actually buy and hold bitcoins. The number of bitcoins in circulation will ultimately be capped at 21 million, and the new bitcoin entering the supply dropped by half on April 19. 
Ipso facto, bitcoin ETF issuer purchasing in response to demand for the funds was a contributor to bitcoin’s price rally to a new all-time high of about $73,000 in mid-March. The opposite can happen when people sell shares of their bitcoin ETFs. 
“ETF flows are meaningful because they provide a glimpse of how a substantial portion of the market that previously lacked straightforward exposure to crypto is behaving,” said David Lawant, head of research at FalconX. “I expect, therefore, ETF flows to continue to influence crypto price action.”
And we know many people care about bitcoin price action.
But what the flows represent, beyond numbers, is also worth noting.
Bitcoin ETF acceptance proved there was untapped demand for crypto and that institutions were willing to jump into the space, Armour told Blockworks.

“That signals support for future growth and interest in the broader crypto market and the future of blockchain technology,” he added.
Ignoring the shorter-term noise
Though bitcoin ETF flows will contribute to BTC price movements, this impact is set to unfold gradually over the coming quarters and years, Lawant said.
“While monitoring these flows is crucial and short-term fluctuations may capture headlines, I think it’s essential to filter out the short-term noise and focus on the factors that are more relevant in the long run,” he noted.
The seven straight days of bitcoin ETF net outflows may cause some alarm to the space’s interest parties. But this reversal was expected, Armour said.   
“Demand cannot continue at the rapid pace seen early on for spot bitcoin ETFs,” he told Blockworks. “Demand will become intermittent, but I wouldn’t expect major sustained outflows without a significant price decline.”
Bitcoin’s price stood at about 61,700 at noon ET — up 4.5% on the day and down 4% from a week ago. 
Other segment observers took to the platform formerly called Twitter to let new ETF investors know that outflows are a thing that happens, regardless of the underlying asset.
Nate Geraci pointed to year-to-date outflows for State Street Global Advisors’ SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which stand at about $2.9 billion, according to ETF.com. That comes despite the price of gold being up about 11% from the start of 2024. 
“This is what ETFs do,” Geraci wrote on X. “Inflows don’t go up in [a] straight line.”
A little spat broke out when macro strategist Jim Bianco highlighted the latest bitcoin ETF outflows in an X post Thursday. The president of Bianco Research had formerly said that “normies” getting into crypto had been “rugged” following a so-called sell-the-news correction in the weeks after the fund launched.  
Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that outflows for the day in question (Wednesday’s $564 million of bleeding) roughly represented just 1% of the category’s assets under management. 
The outflows over the past few weeks combined to amount to less than 5% of the segment’s total assets, which Balchunas added “is totally normal for [a] risk asset ETF during sell-off.”
“Are you saying yesterday was not a beginning, but an end?” Bianco replied. 
Balchunas: could see the ETFs shedding 10% of assets under management if bitcoin’s correction worsens.“But, it’s a good [question] in that all of this is just beginning if we zoom out,” the Bloomberg Intelligence analyst noted. “These ETFs will be around for years, decades. And they tend to win assets and volume [versus] other vehicles over time, albeit not always in a perfectly straight line.”

There is only so much you can surmise from bitcoin ETF inflows and outflows, as the data gathered doesn’t shed light on where prices go next, Armour said.“Will speculators flee during a bear market to the point of creating an existential crisis?” Armour posed. “Will crypto’s integration into daily life support current price levels? I don’t think a framework exists for accurately predicting where crypto will go from here.”

Spot bitcoin ETFs are “just one cog in the bitcoin machine,” Armour added. They represent roughly 4% of bitcoin’s market cap. 
“Their rapid ascension had an outsized impact on the price of bitcoin, but the broader bitcoin ecosystem will regain its influence as US ETF flows stabilize,” Armour said.

$5.5M Move Shakes Ethereum as Genesis-Era Wallet Awakens - DailyCoin


        
An Ethereum ICO participant has moved for the first time in nearly nine years.



The massive ETH transfer has stoked sell-off concerns.



ETH remains below $3,000 after recent macroeconomic and whale-induced sell-offs.
Amid recent macroeconomic concerns and hitherto dormant whale movement, Ethereum has experienced a steady decline in recent weeks that has seen it drop below the psychologically important $3,000 price level for the first time since February 2024. Further stirring sell-off concerns, another Ethereum Genesis-era address has moved after nearly nine years of dormancy.Ethereum ICO Participant Sends Out $5.5M in ETHOn Thursday, May 2, crypto smart money tracker Lookonchain disclosed that a wallet that had received 1,969.488 ETH, currently worth around $5.9 million, had moved for the first time in nearly nine years, sending out 1,960 ETH worth $5.5 million. While the purpose of the recent transfer is unclear, dormant wallet address movement is typically seen as bearish. This sentiment is mainly due to the unrealized profits these accounts are sitting on. At the same time, the significant assets they control can often influence price movements.
In the case of the recent dormant whale move, the entity purchased its holdings at $0.31 per ETH, or about $610. At current prices, it is looking at an over 960,000% gain of over $5.8 million.Amid the market concerns, ETH continues to trade below the $3,000 price point at $2,961, according to CoinMarketCap data at the time of writing.On the Flipside 
ETH has not reacted significantly to the news.



ETH is still up over 30% year-to-date (YTD).
Why This Matters Crypto investors follow the movements of large crypto holders like the recently active dormant address, as they can impact price. For long dormant addresses, the chances of a sell-off are usually higher due to large unrealized profits.

Iran & Arkansas - Is crypto mining under threat right now? - AMBCrypto



Senators Warren and King believe Iran’s crypto mining profits pose national security concerns
Arkansas lawmakers passed a bill regulating crypto mining

With Bitcoin’s halving well behind the industry right now, all eyes are now fixed on miners and the ripple effects on crypto mining worldwide. At the forefront of this discussion stands Iran, a country that has a history of facilitating mining services and has used crypto-mining to evade global sanctions. 
According to U.S Senators Elizabeth Warren and Angus King, “Iran has raised millions of dollars through mining crypto.”
Senators’ letter highlights concerns 
In a joint letter written by Warren and King, the Senators have now sought clarification over the Biden administration’s plans to tackle Iran’s use of cryptocurrency mining to evade U.S. and international sanctions. According to the lawmakers, 
“This ongoing activity by the Iranian government threatens our national security.” 
They added, 
“Crypto-mining has become increasingly lucrative for Iran. Between 2015 and 2021, Bitcoin mining funnelled more than $186 million into Iranian crypto-platforms, most of it in 2021.”
 Arkansas’s passage of new bills
Crypto-mining isn’t an international issue alone. Domestically too, it has been in the news a lot lately. In fact, Arkansas lawmakers have now approved two bills regulating cryptocurrency mining. The decision stems from criticisms surrounding noisy operations, excessive water and electricity consumption, and cybersecurity risks linked to foreign ownership.
Senate Bill 78 imposes noise limits and ownership restrictions on crypto-mines, while empowering local governments too. On the other hand, Senate Bill 79 mandates state licensing through the Oil and Gas Commission.
These bills aim to rectify perceived shortcomings in the 2023 Arkansas Data Centers Act (Act 851), which previously prevented local oversight of crypto-mining. Despite its smooth passage in 2023, Act 851 drew criticism from some quarters for being inadequate on the regulatory front. 
Lawmakers’ debate 
Lawmakers, acknowledging their oversight, have responded by passing these new bills, marking a notable legislative development during a fiscal session. It’s worth pointing out, however, that during the debate between the lawmakers, Rep. Tippi McCullough asked, 
“Does the bill mandate, specific types of noise reduction listed, or might open it up to maybe just putting some cotton balls outside the walls and saying ‘we tried to reduce the noise.’”
Sen. Joshua Bryant replied, 
“The bill should be read to mean that noise reduction must be as effective as those methods.” 
Not everyone agreed with the scope of these bills though, with some voicing reservations while others claimed that this is simply a temporary solution until something permanent is legislated upon. 
Needless to say, despite it being almost a month after the halving, miners still have a lot on their minds. Both on the domestic and the international scale.

Cartier jewelry heir arrested for laundering drug money with USDT


The US Justice Department (DoJ) has indicted and arrested an heir to the Cartier jewelry empire with conspiring to launder the proceeds of drug trafficking using tether (USDT).
In Miami, law enforcement arrested Maximilien de Hoop Cartier, a direct descendant of Louis Cartier, the founder of the luxury watch, necklace, and bracelet maker, where he was allegedly coordinating with a Colombian drug cartel.
Alongside five Colombian nationals, Cartier tried to import 100 kilos of cocaine and launder hundreds of millions of dollars, mostly through over-the-counter (OTC) USDT trades. They actually succeeded at laundering 14.5 million USDT before their arrests.
Cartier is currently in a Miami detention center while his co-conspirators are in Colombian jails.
To carry out his scheme, Cartier controlled shell companies and misrepresented to financial institutions that they were in the business of software and technology. He then used the companies’ accounts, according to the indictment, as unlicensed money transmitters.
Using USDT, dollars, pesos, and other currencies, Cartier laundered hundreds of millions of dollars worth of criminal proceeds.

Cartier jewelry heir loved tether
Cartier has spent most of his life in France, although his citizenship is Argentine. He faces four counts of criminal misconduct: money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering, transacting in property derived from specified unlawful activity, and operating an unlicensed money remitter.
Jeweler Louis Francis Cartier founded the luxury brand in Paris in 1847. Maximilien Cartier, his descendant, also owned a wine, beer, and bottled water company, Patagonia.
USDT is uniquely suited to money laundering. It substitutes directly for dollars yet, unlike bank transfers, may be sent permissionlessly to anyone using 16 blockchains within seconds. For drug cartels accustomed to risky cash deliveries and unreliable bank wires, USDT’s nearly instant and irreversible settlement is a welcome upgrade.

The Dollar Won, but Might the U.S. Lose Control of the Dollar?

Synthetic dollars, in effect, can cost more than “real” dollars because you need to over-capitalize your collateral in order to avoid the risk of losing that alignment with the U.S. dollar. Despite these risks, quite a few blockchain-based digital assets have been established with a peg to the U.S. dollar. The dai, from MakerDAO, is probably the most successful of these, though its backing today includes some U.S. dollar assets. There are others, however, that are pegged purely based on cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that do not connect with the dollar.

MicroStrategy dives into Bitcoin ‘Decentralized ID’; What’s next for MSTR stock?


MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), a well-known leader in Bitcoin (BTC) investments, has recently ventured into blockchain technology, capturing significant attention.
At the company’s Bitcoin For Corporations conference on May 1, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor unveiled “MicroStrategy Orange,” a new decentralized identity solution that operates directly on the Bitcoin network.
This service, MicroStrategy Orange, marks a pivotal advancement in using the Bitcoin blockchain for more than just financial transactions. 


It utilizes Ordinal-based inscriptions to create decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that store and retrieve data without depending on sidechains. The system is designed for high scalability and efficiency, capable of processing up to 10,000 DIDs in a single transaction.
An unofficial draft shared on GitHub outlines the service’s objective:

The goal of this method is to deliver trustless, tamper-proof, and enduring decentralized identities utilizing only the public Bitcoin blockchain as a data source.

Further expanding its blockchain offerings, MicroStrategy has leveraged the Bitcoin Ordinals Protocol to issue these DIDs, which provide a level of pseudonymity similar to that of Bitcoin transactions. This protocol facilitates data storage and communication on individual satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin.
MicroStrategy has already developed one practical application of this technology, “Orange For Outlook.” This application integrates digital signatures into emails, allowing recipients to verify the sender’s identity, thus enhancing the security and trustworthiness of digital communications.
Criticisms and market response
Despite its innovative prospects, MicroStrategy’s project has faced criticism. Tony Giorgio, co-founder of Mutiny Wallet, has questioned the viability of DIDs and criticized Saylor’s method of utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain for data storage. 

On the other hand, some Bitcoin enthusiasts and supporters viewed  it as a legitimate extension of Bitcoin’s functionality beyond speculative uses like NFTs. 
Fred Krueger pointed out the practical applications of using Bitcoin as a data layer, supporting the integration of Ordinals for such purposes.

MSTR stock analysis
MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings stand at 214,400 BTC, costing an average of $35,180 per Bitcoin. Amidst these developments, MSTR stock has shown significant volatility. As of the latest trading session, the stock is priced at $1,222, down from a high of $1,723 in early April.

This price action reflects a bearish sentiment among investors, compounded by CEO Michael Saylor selling 400,000 shares of his company’s stock since the beginning of the year.

Current analysis indicates a potential further decline in stock prices, despite an average 12-month price target of $1,733.75 by Wall Street analysts.

A Comprehensive Guide to Shorting Bitcoin on Binance and Coinbase | Coin Insider


Key Takeaways:Understand the risks: Shorting Bitcoin involves betting that its price will decrease. This means you’re vulnerable to potential losses if the price rises instead. Due to Bitcoin’s volatility, shorting can be particularly risky. Make sure you’re prepared for possible losses and only invest what you can afford to lose.Research the platforms: Both Binance and Coinbase offer options for shorting Bitcoin, but their processes and requirements may differ. Research each platform thoroughly to understand its fee structures, margin requirements, and limitations on shorting Bitcoin. Utilise risk management strategies: Implement risk management strategies to protect your investment. This may include setting stop-loss orders to automatically sell your Bitcoin if the price reaches a certain threshold, diversifying your portfolio to mitigate losses, and staying informed about market trends and news that could impact Bitcoin’s price.Shorting Bitcoin, also known as short-selling, is a trading strategy where an investor aims to profit from a lessening in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) Overview of Shorting BitcoinShort-selling BTC is unlike traditional investing, where you buy low and sell high; shorting involves selling high and buying low. This plan is employed by traders anticipating a downward market movement. For instance, traders take a loan from a trading platform, sell it with the hope it will decline, and then purchase it to repay it. If the price drops, they repurchase BTC at a lower cost and thus profit. Although shorting BTC seems alluring, it can be risky because if the BTC price goes up, traders will still need to purchase it at a price greater than what they initially traded for, resulting in significant losses. In shorting, BTC futures and options such as derivative contracts can be used, exposing traders to price fluctuations without owning them. Identifying Potential Bitcoin Shorting OpportunitiesIn the world of cryptocurrencies, BTC remains a focal point for traders seeking long and short positions. Shorting BTC involves selling it at a high price with the anticipation of repurchasing it at a lower cost to profit from the price difference. However, shorting comes with significant risks due to BTCs notorious price swings. Technical AnalysisUtilise technical indicators such as Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and Bollinger Bands to gauge the market sentiment and identify potential entry points for short positions. Look for overbought conditions or bearish reversal patterns on the price chart.Market SentimentMonitor market sentiment through social media, news outlets, and sentiment analysis tools. Negative news or a shift in sentiment towards BTC can create shorting opportunities. For instance, regulatory announcements, security breaches, or negative comments from influential figures can trigger a bearish trend.Fundamental AnalysisConsider fundamental factors that could impact BTC price. These may include regulation changes, technological developments, adoption rates, macroeconomic factors, and geopolitical events. Any adverse news or events affecting the BTC ecosystem could signal a potential downtrend suitable for shorting.Market VolatilityBTC is known for its high volatility, which can create opportunities for short-term traders. Monitor volatility levels using indicators like Average True Range (ATR) to identify periods of heightened volatility that may precede price declines. Be cautious during low volatility periods, which indicate a potential price breakout.Chart PatternsStudy chart patterns such as head and shoulders, double tops, and descending triangles, which often precede price reversals. These patterns can supply valuable insights into potential shorting opportunities when connected with other technical indicators and market analysis.Risk ManagementImplement effective plans to protect your capital when shorting BTC. Set stop-loss orders to limit future losses and adhere to strict risk-reward ratios. Avoid over-leveraging positions, as BTC volatility can lead to swift losses if the market moves against your position.Macro TrendsAnalyse broader market trends and correlations with traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. Economic downturns or market crashes in traditional markets may trigger a flight to safety, leading investors to sell risky assets like BTC.Hedge Against Long PositionsShorting BTC can also be used as a hedge against long positions to mitigate downside risk during uncertain market conditions. You can protect your portfolio from poor price movements by shorting an equivalent amount of BTC to your long position.Continuous MonitoringStay aware and monitor the market for trends, sentiment, and fundamental factors that could affect BTC price dynamics. Markets can quickly reverse direction, so be prepared to adjust your shorting strategy accordingly.Understanding Shorting on BinanceBinance is one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, offering a wide range of trading options, including shorting. Create an AccountIf you don’t already have one, sign up for a Binance account. Complete the verification process as required by the platform.Deposit Funds You can deposit funds into your Binance account by transferring BTC or any other supported crypto from another exchange or wallet.Navigate to the Futures Trading Section Binance offers futures trading, where you can short BTC with leverage. Go to the futures trading section on the Binance website or mobile app.Choose Bitcoin Futures ContractSelect the futures contract you want to trade on Binance. The contracts have different expiration dates and leverage options.Enter Short PositionOnce you’ve chosen your desired futures contract, enter the amount you want to short and select “Sell/Short.” Be cautious with leverage, as it amplifies both gains and losses.Monitor and Close PositionMonitor your position as the market moves. You can close your short position anytime by placing a buy order for the same amount of BTC futures contracts.Shorting Bitcoin on CoinbaseWhile Coinbase is primarily known as a crypto brokerage, it also offers advanced trading features through Coinbase Pro. Here’s how you can short BTC on Coinbase Pro:Create an Account If you don’t have a Coinbase account, sign up for one. Verify your identity and complete the necessary steps to access Coinbase Pro.Deposit Funds Transfer funds to your Coinbase account. You can deposit fiat currency via bank transfer or crypto from another exchange or wallet.Navigate to Coinbase ProGo to the Coinbase Pro platform once your funds are available. The interface is more suitable for advanced trading than the standard Coinbase interface.Place a Sell OrderOn the trading dashboard, select the BTC trading pair you want to short (e.g., BTC/USD) and place a sell order for the amount of BTC you want to short.Monitor and Close PositionKeep track of your short position as the market moves. You can close your position by placing a buy order for the same amount of BTC when you think it’s profitable.Risk Management and ConsiderationsShorting BTC can be profitable, but it also carries significant risks. Use Stop-Loss Orders Implement stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the market moves against your short position.Manage Leverage Be cautious when trading with leverage, as it amplifies profits and losses. Only use leverage if you fully understand how it works and are comfortable with the associated risks.Stay Informed Stay updated on market trends, news, and events that could impact the price of BTC. Market sentiment can change rapidly, affecting your short position.Diversify Your PortfolioAvoid putting all your funds into short positions on BTC alone. Diversifying your portfolio can help mitigate risk.Practice Risk ManagementOnly trade with funds you can afford to lose. Avoid over-leveraging or risking more than you can comfortably lose in a trade.Shorting Bitcoin on exchanges like Binance and Coinbase can be lucrative if executed correctly. It requires careful planning, risk management, and market analysis. By following the steps outlined in this guide and implementing proper risk management techniques, you can profit from downward movements in the price of Bitcoin. Remember to stay informed, monitor your positions closely, and be prepared to adjust your strategy as market conditions change.

Bitcoin is back above $60K, stocks rally on cooler jobs data - Blockworks


The price of bitcoin was back above $61,000 this afternoon in New York while stocks rallied on reports that hiring is starting to slow. 
Bitcoin was up more than 4% over 24 hours at time of publication, paring losses from earlier in the week that saw the largest cryptocurrency dip as low as $56,500, per Coinbase. Ether similarly bounced Friday, once again hitting the $3,000 level after hovering in the high $2,000 range for most of the week. 
US stocks broadly opened higher Friday after the latest jobs report showed the economy added 175,000 positions in April, finally coming more in line with the pre-pandemic average of 183,000 job gains per month.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes were up 1% and 2%, respectively, at time of publication. The end-of-week rally was enough to push both indexes into the green over the past five trading days. 
Crypto-related stocks posted mixed returns midway through Friday’s session. Coinbase lost 3% even after earnings released Thursday showed that revenue beat expectations by close to 20%. MicroStrategy and mining operation Marathon Digital, on the other hand, were in the green, posting around 8% and 3% gains, respectively, Friday. 
The latest jobs data comes days after the Federal Reserve announced that interest rates would be holding steady for the time being. Central bankers will need to see further evidence that inflation is falling and the labor market is cooling, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. 
Even after Friday’s promising report, Fed fund futures markets still showed only a 14% chance of a rate cut in June, according to data from CME Group. The delayed cut cycle could bode well for risk assets like cryptos, though, analysts said. 
“With rate hikes off the table and markets already pricing in little to no cuts for 2024, we think that this bodes constructively for risk assets as the worst of stagflationary headwinds might be behind us,” analysts from Ryze Labs said in a note Friday.

Why Friend.Tech's FRIEND Token Crashed After Crypto Airdrop


Friend.Tech, a decentralized social media platform, has launched its much-anticipated crypto airdrop. 
Shortly after its introduction, the FRIEND token experienced a significant price drop as the platform rolled out its latest version, Friend.Tech V2.
Friend.Tech Releases Airdrop, FRIEND Token Drops
On May 3, Friend.Tech distributed its native token, FRIEND, and introduced version 2 of the platform, featuring new additions like the Money Club. Right after trading commenced on Base, the token’s price surged to $169 but then sharply dropped to $3.26.
The biggest recipient of the crypto airdrop on Friend.Tech liquidated his entire token holdings a few hours after receiving them, sparking worries about the impact on the token’s market value. As a result, the FRIEND token experienced another decline of 52.5%, dropping from $3.26 to $1.32. 
The unstable price movements appear to stem from issues with liquidity. Liquidity is the market’s capacity to handle large purchases and sales without significant price changes. In markets with low liquidity, a small number of large transactions can disproportionately influence the market price.


“This has to be a joke, Friend.Tech only added $0.01 in liquidity. So first you milk your users with fees, then you get them to add liquidity so that they can dump on each other. Top class team here,” a crypto community memeber said.

Despite the controversy, Friend.Tech is the ninth-largest protocol on the Base network with a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $28 million. 
The introduction of the Money Club in V2 aims to renew interest as communities can now manage shared treasuries. Other features include customizable engagement metrics in chats to enhance user interaction. These improvements position Friend.Tech to not only increase platform usage but also regain its competitive edge in decentralized social networks.

Arthur Hayes Sees Bitcoin Bottom In, Predicts 'Range-Bound Price Action' Until August - Benzinga

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes on Friday said that Bitcoin BTC/USD has likely hit a local bottom and is poised for a comeback despite the recent price drop to around $58,000 levels.What Happened: In his latest blog post, Hayes expressed concerns about the implications of recent U.S. financial policies, stating, “Did Bitcoin hit a local low at around $58,600 earlier this week? Yes.”He predicts a rally to above $60,000 and then “range-bound price action between $60,000 and $70,000 until August.” Hayes attributes this volatility to a series of macroeconomic triggers including U.S. tax season pressures, speculation about Federal Reserve actions, and broader market reactions to regulatory news.Highlighting the role of U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve policies, Hayes points out that changes in quantitative tightening and interest payments could significantly influence liquidity in the financial system. He notes, “Reducing the pace of asset runoff from the Fed's balance in accordance with their quantitative tightening (QT) program sounds benign. But make no mistake — by reducing the rate of QT from $95 billion to $60 billion per month, the Fed is essentially adding $35 billion per month of dollar liquidity.”Also Read: Friend.Tech Launches Version 2 With Native Token Airdrop, But Not Everything Goes According To Plan…The financial instability highlighted by the recent failure of small banks, such as Republic First Bank, and the responses to these events have stirred significant discussions about the security of digital assets. The FDIC’s intervention to insure all deposits following the bank’s failure has been critiqued by Hayes as a form of stealth money printing that could have long-term inflationary impacts.These developments come at a crucial time when the cryptocurrency community is looking towards future regulations and innovations in digital asset security. What’s Next: This topic is set to be a major discussion point at the upcoming Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, where industry leaders will explore the implications of recent economic policies on cryptocurrencies and discuss strategies to enhance digital asset security and investor confidence in this volatile market.Read Next: Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $34M Net Outflow On ThursdayImage: Shutterstock

Bitcoin HODLing: Weak Hands Not Capitulating Despite Crash


								On-chain data suggests the Bitcoin short-term holders haven’t been capitulating during the crash, a sign that a shift has occurred in the market.
Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Haven’t Been Doing Much Loss-Selling Recently
As pointed out by analyst James Van Straten in a post on X, the BTC short-term holders haven’t been sending much BTC at a loss recently, despite the plunge the asset’s price has suffered.
The “short-term holders” (STHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. These investors make up one of the two main divisions of the BTC market, with the other cohort being known as the “long-term holders” (LTHs).

Statistically, the longer an investor holds their coins, the less likely they are to sell at any point. As such, the LTHs are considered the resolute side of the market, while the STHs are considered the weak hands.
Generally, the STHs easily sell whenever a change in the market happens, like a crash or rally. As such, these investors could be expected to have participated in some selling during the latest plummet in the coin as well.
One way to track whether these investors are selling or not is to track their exchange deposits. Holders don’t always deposit to these platforms for selling, as they offer other services as well, but inflows during a rally/crash are more often than not an indication of a selloff.
In the current discussion, the entire exchange transfer volume for this cohort isn’t of interest, but only the part of it that’s being deposited at a loss. As Straten has highlighted in the chart below, a curious pattern has emerged in this loss exchange inflow volume for the STHs.

The value of the metric appears to have been on the decline in recent weeks | Source: @jvs_btc on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin transfer volume from the STHs in loss to exchanges registered a huge spike back in January, as the market downturn following the approval of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) occurred.
In the price decline that followed the top in May, the metric also registered a large spike, although notably smaller in scale than the January one. It would appear that during both of these drawdowns, the STHs had shown a significant capitulation reaction.
During the latest crash, however, the trend doesn’t appear to have been the same. “What is really interesting is that in these past two days, Bitcoin dropped 12%, but STHs sent very little Bitcoin to exchanges at a loss,” notes the analyst.

This would suggest that these weak hands have gained some strength recently. “Lettuce hands are becoming slightly less erratic, signs of a maturing market,” says Straten.
BTC Price
Bitcoin has shown some recovery from the crash during the past 24 hours as its price has now returned back to the $60,700 level.

Australian court rules against Qoin issuer BPS Financial on 4 charges

The Australian Securities & Investment Commission (ASIC) has won a court case against BPS Financial. The firm is accused of deceptive practices in connection with its non-cash payment facility, powered by the Qoin token.The Federal Court of Australia found that BPS made four false claims. Specifically, BPS claimed that Qoin was registered or approved by the government, legally complaint, freely exchangeable for other crypto assets or fiat and was accepted by a growing network of merchants. The court ruled that BPS violated the Corporations Act and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act. It ordered the sides to confer on the next steps before another hearing this year, which may include penalties.BPS launched Qoin in January 2020. According to its website, the Qoin ecosystem consists of its token, blockchain, wallet  and a “payment facility.” Qoin has more than 100,000 users and 36,000 registered merchants, and there were 394 million Qoin tokens in circulation at the end of June 2021, it added.Source: ASIC MediaA class action suit was filed against BPS in November 2021 for deception, noncompliance with regulations and being a pyramid scheme. That case appears to remain open. Qoin was also expelled from the Blockchain Australia industry association in February 2021.ASIC initiated its action against BPS in October 2022. According to its statement, the court decision in its favor was the first ruling against a non-cash payment facility involving crypto. ASIC Chair Joe Longo said:"ASIC has taken a number of enforcement actions against crypto asset businesses with the intention of clarifying what is a regulated product and when the provider needs a licence."Related: Swyftx to chop its ‘Earn’ program this week, citing murky regulationsASIC sued financial product comparison website Finder.com in December 2022 for offering an unlicensed cryptocurrency yield-bearing product. The court ruled against ASIC in March and  ASIC is appealing that decision. In a case brought by ASIC against crypto lender Block Earner, the court ruled that managed crypto products providing a yield require a license, but products that “pass through” an entity as access to decentralized finance (DeFi) may not.

Costly Mistake: Victim Loses $68 Million In Address Poisoning Scam


																Crypto hackers have claimed another major victim, fooling him into sending $68 million to a wallet he thought was somebody else’s.
Blockchain data indicates that a once-wealthy Ethereum user lost all of his Bitcoin holdings after hackers contaminated a recipient’s wallet history. The user now holds just $1.6 million in crypto at his address.
The Danger Of Address Poisoning
According to Etherscan, the sending wallet’s remaining assets include 0.89 ETH ($2,747) and 1.63 million dollar-pegged DAI stablecoins.
The assets stolen from the victim included 1155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) – a token that operates like a stablecoin for Bitcoin on the Ethereum network, mirroring the price of the dominant digital asset. Naturally, WBTC is vulnerable to the many hacks and exploits common in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as address poisoning.
Wallet contamination or “address poisoning” involves sending a transaction – usually of zero or negligible value – to a victim’s wallet, simply so that the attacker’s address appears in the victim’s transaction history.




Notably, attackers will deliberately generate their address to have several starting and ending characters that match those of an address belonging to the victim. Popular wallet software often shrinks addresses to display only the first and last characters, making the differences in the middle undetectable on the surface.
Address Poisoning In Action
In this case, both the attacker’s address and the real target address had characters starting with 0xd9A1, and ending with 853a91.
Ideally, the attacker hopes they try to copy that address from their history the next time they intend to receive a transaction, under the mistaken belief that it’s their address or that of someone they know.
Last year, address poisoners targeted a series of SafeWallet users, stealing $2 million within one week. Back in February, a Kraken user was robbed of 1 million USDT after scammers poisoned their history mimicking the victim’s prior interaction with the exchange.
Metamask suggests users avoid copying transactions from their history, and to add frequently used addresses to their address book to avoid using any that aren’t specifically whitelisted.
“This advice applies to your own address as much as it does the addresses of others to whom you may be sending funds,” the wallet provider states on its website.

MicroStrategy Orange: Everything You Need to Know About Decentralized ID on Bitcoin - Decrypt

Following through on hints that MicroStrategy would get into Bitcoin software development as the Ordinals craze took off last summer, the company this week announced MicroStrategy Orange, a decentralized identity (DID) platform. The sprawling concept has applications for combating social media bots and spam, authenticating documents, and securing medical records.As the proposed specification for Orange went public on GitHub, it received a mixed reaction from Crypto Twitter, in part due to its technical complexity of the plans. Here’s a basic primer on the proposed digital ID system, and how it ties into Bitcoin.What is MicroStrategy Orange?MicroStrategy Orange is a Bitcoin-based decentralized identity (DID) system that was introduced by MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, alongside Executive VP of Engineering Cezary Raczko, at the annual MicroStrategy World conference on May 1.MicroStrategy Orange is an attempt to facilitate immutable, or permanently fixed, decentralized identities. These identifiers would then provide a way for individuals to control and verify their identity without relying on a central authority.How would Orange be used in real life?MicroStrategy said the potential of MicroStrategy Orange and decentralized identifiers on Bitcoin could also be used to verify users on social media applications, or authenticate text messages or medical records.For example, a social media app could verify a user's DID on the Bitcoin blockchain and display an "orange check" to other users. Or a medical record's metadata—perhaps a hash of its contents at a fixed point in time—could be stored on Bitcoin and used to authenticate its owner and that it hasn't been modified. Public records like land and home deeds could also be inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain.What is DID:BTC, and how does Bitcoin fit into it?By establishing a decentralized identity system on Bitcoin, dubbed DID:BTC, users can benefit from the robust security and global decentralized network of the Bitcoin blockchain.According to MicroStrategy, DID:BTC uses a modified version of Ordinals inscriptions. Introduced in January 2023, Ordinals inscriptions are digital assets (images, text, music, videos) that are “inscribed” onto an individual Satoshi, the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin.In the case of MicroStrategy Orange, the inscription space would be used to store DID-related data and updates. This identity, authentication, and verification information would be separate from other digital data—for example, images or documents—which would be stored elsewhere.As a result, DID-authenticated files could be created and updated without hitting size or content restrictions, yet take advantage of the cost-saving mechanism introduced by the Segregated Witness (SegWit) protocol in the Bitcoin network.SegWit, introduced in 2017, increases Bitcoin’s block capacity by separating signature data from transaction data, reducing transaction sizes and enhancing scalability.What does the proposed DID:BTC specification tell us?The preliminary draft of the Bitcoin Orange plan was published on GitHub, allowing public inspection, comment, and eventually in-line discussion and collaborative edits. While largely technical, it covers several major topics, including how data would be formatted in Bitcoin inscriptions and its privacy implications.For example, the spec allows for updates to be made to DID:BTC identifiers on-chain. While the original DID identifier is immutable, the associated content and keys associated with it can be modified.Updates to DID:BTC identifiers are made using JSON, a standard format for data exchange.In cases where an identity needs to be removed, meanwhile, MicroStrategy said a DID:BTC identifier can be deactivated by “spending” it—setting a flag using residual UTXO (unspent transaction output).What are critics saying about MicroStrategy Orange?Reactions to MicroStrategy’s announcement were mixed on Crypto Twitter, with some Bitcoin enthusiasts saying DID data is not welcome on the world’s dominant blockchain. It's a similar reaction that we've seen to the rise of Ordinals inscriptions, along with Bitcoin meme coins via the BRC-20 and Runes token standards.Taproot Wizards CEO Udi Wertheimer joked that "laser-eye maxis" who supported Saylor's sizable Bitcoin buys were "in absolute shambles as their lord and savior" brought "institutional-grade spam" to the blockchain.“I don’t like shitcoins at all, but if I close my eyes this speech sounds like it coming from the US government,” one post said, with another calling Saylor “fed boy.”“WTF is this dog vomit trash? No. Never. No,” another replied.Saylor had honed in on the commercial implications of Ordinals inscriptions as soon as they emerged, Bitcoin proponent and venture capitalist Preston Pysh pointed out.When will we be able to use Orange?MicroStrategy did not say when the Orange protocol would come online, and noted that information published on GitHub is an unofficial early draft. Even when finalized, there’s no telling whether other Bitcoin projects, crypto platforms, or apps would make use of it.Edited by Ryan Ozawa and Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Two US Representatives Urge the SEC To Approve Options on Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A pair of bipartisan US congressmen are reportedly asking the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to greenlight options trading on spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Citing a letter sent to SEC chair Gary Gensler, Axios reports that Representatives Mike Flood (R-NE) and Wiley Nickel (D-NC) say that approving options trading on Bitcoin ETFs is critical and crucial to investors that the securities watchdog seeks to protect.










Reads the document, according to Axios,
“We urge you, without delay, to approve options on spot Bitcoin ETPs or to provide an explanation for the Commission’s difference in treatment between options for Bitcoin futures ETFs—which are currently trading—and options for the spot Bitcoin ETPs (exchange-traded products).” 
Several exchanges, including Cboe, BOX, MIAX, Nasdaq ISE, and NYSE American, have filed with the SEC to offer options trading on the new Bitcoin ETFs.
The SEC has not yet acted on the exchanges’ proposals and is currently soliciting public comment on rule changes that will permit options trading on Bitcoin funds.
The agency says the proposed rule changes should align with the provisions in the Securities Exchange Act that aim to protect investors and the public interest.
Says the SEC in a notice dated April 24,
“[T]he Commission invites the written views of interested persons concerning whether the proposed rule changes are consistent with Section 6(b)(5), or any other provision of the Act, or the rules and regulations thereunder.”

Bitcoin Jumps Above $61,000 as US Unemployment Rate Rises With Fewer-Than-Expected Jobs Added - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin (BTC) is surging past the $61,000 price level as new data reveals that unemployment is on the rise in the US.
According to a new economic news release from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), fewer-than-expected nonfarm jobs were added in the US during the month of April, contributing to the unemployment rate rising from 3.8% to 3.9%.










“Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 175,000 in April, and the unemployment rate changed little at 3.9 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Job gains occurred in health care, in social assistance, and in transportation and warehousing… 
Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult men (3.6 percent) increased in April.” 
However, the data also reveals that hourly wages for nonfarm workers are on the rise as the average hourly earnings increased by $0.07 during the month of April. Over the last year, their average hourly earnings have gone up nearly 4%.
Though the US was able to add 175,000 jobs during the month of April, it missed the mark as CNBC reports the Dow Jones consensus estimate was that about 240,000 jobs would be created.
News of the unemployment data coincided with the top crypto asset by market cap skyrocketing in price. The crypto king is trading for $61,428 at time of writing, a 3.6% increase during the last 24 hours. On January 23rd, BTC was valued at $39,833.

Binance Burns 1.5B LUNC in Quest to Reduce Overprinted Supply - DailyCoin


        
Binance’s latest LUNC burn removes 1.5B coins from LUNC circulation.



Terra Luna Classic’s trading volume significantly dropped since March.



Analysts measure LUNC’s breakout chances based on a triple bottom.
Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) has received a strong boost from Binance, the leading crypto exchange by trading volume. Ever since Terra’s blockchain experienced a devastating crisis in May 2022, the exchange has taken it upon itself to reduce the overprinted supply of LUNC.Revitalization Efforts Post-UST CrashWhile the collapse has led to both Terra (LUNA) and Terra USD (UST) crumbling to pieces, the blockchain’s original coins were relaunched as Terra Luna Classic and Terra Classic USD (USTC). As TerraForm Labs focused on Terra 2.0 before going bankrupt, the classic Terra tokens were given to the LUNC community.As a method of bolstering recovery, Binance’s founder and former CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao lent a helping hand and explained that “minting, forking, don’t create value. Buying back, burning does, but it requires funds.” Since then, 21 LUNC burning batches have been conducted.With the latest Terra Classic burn ceremony on May 1, Binance has destroyed 1.5B tokens. According to on-chain records, this latest burning puts Terra Luna Classic’s remaining supply at 5,799,881,270,168 tokens.Can LUNC Make It Back to TOP 100?According to Binance’s burning strategy, the crypto exchange utilizes LUNC’s trading fees in relevant Spot pairs. This initiative inspired stakers and validators to approach other crypto exchanges to set up an all-around LUNC burning policy.In addition, the community aims to coordinate burns involving USTC, as the depegged algorithmic stablecoin is still trading below two cents. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency chart analysts believe that LUNC’s make-or-break moment underlies the $0.00013 price range.According to crypto trader Derek, LUNC is attempting to break out from short-term support, depicted in the graph above with three green-colored upward arrows. Breaking past this momentary support line on May 2, 2024, LUNC now trades at $0.0001045, with a 3.4% upswing over the past 24 hours.
The trader believes a stronger bounce back to the $0.00016 level is on the cards if LUNC manages to close the week above $0.000103. Hence, a gradual upward trajectory to reclaim a $1bn market cap could put LUNC back in the TOP 100. In contrast to today’s LUNC outbreak, the altcoin is still 25.5% down over the past 30 days.On the Flipside
Binance managed to collect a significantly lower amount of trading fees in the 21st Terra Luna Classic burn ceremony on May 1, 2024.



To compare, a gargantuan 4.17B LUNC tokens were burnt in March converting to $722.6K as LUNC daily trades hemmed in over $100M per day.
Why This MattersDespite falling out from the TOP 100 by market cap, Terra Luna Classic’s coordinated rejuvenation efforts continue with assistance from community developers and major crypto exchanges.Discover DailyCoin’s popular crypto news:Kraken’s Indices Unit Claims 50% of Crypto Benchmarking MarketAltcoin Season: Tips and Tactics for Market Research

ZKasino Scam: Dutch authorities arrest rug pull member | Cryptopolitan

Though crypto has been used for positive purposes across the globe, its negative use is nothing new. It has been used for different criminal activities, including scams. Dutch authorities announced recently that they have arrested a 26-year-old man allegedly for rug pull in betting platform ZKasino. ZKasino ScamZKasino is a betting platform that can be used for online gambling using crypto. There is a range of tools and templates that can allow a range of users to work on crypto betting. Furthermore, there is no need to have coding experience. It enables users to transfer tokens between Ethereum and ZKasino chain. It is globally ranked 38th for gambling in online platforms. Furthermore, it is useable on a range of programs which include Arbitrum, Fantom, Polygon, etc. The negative side of this platform is that there is no need for KYC, signups, and other procedures. As the result of no verification, there is a possibility of rug pulls and other scams happening to the customers. Though the company claims to have fairness and transparency, there are various incidents where the users were scammed.

Authorities expect that a breakthrough regarding the scam will happen. Affected to be repaidThe investigation is likely to continue and once the details are complete regarding the keys, the repatriation of funds will take place. Though it will take time there are increased chances that the repatriation of assets to the ZKasino affectees will take place. The alleged person had been in focus of authorities since 25 April and the outcoming details show that it won’t take much time to solve. ConclusionDutch authorities have announced that they have arrested a suspect related to rug pull scam ZKasino. The mentioned platform announced return of assets after thirty days but it didn’t happen. The arrest of its member has been a breakthrough and there is a chance that the affectees might get thier funds back.

US job growth slows as Bitcoin price soars past $62,000


Bitcoin surged past US$62,000 on Friday, as data from the United States Labor Department reported the unemployment rate rising to 3.9% last month.



In April, the U.S. economy’s job growth decelerated, with the creation of 175,000 non-farm jobs falling short of the 243,000 jobs forecasted.



The Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates steady has contributed to the softening of the U.S. dollar and Bitcoin’s rebound.



Bitcoin, which fell to as low as US$56,800 this week, traded at US$61,678 at 2:30 p.m. ET, according to CoinGeck.

	
	
	
	


Bitcoin’s rebound follows multiple positive developments for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, including the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong on Tuesday.



The Bitcoin network underwent the quadrennial halving on April 20, cutting miner rewards by 50% from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoins.



The halving impacts the scarcity of the asset by slowing down the inflow of new Bitcoins.



The launch of Runes, which is a new fungible token protocol on Bitcoin, also coincided with the halving.

Solana to join Bitcoin and Ethereum as top crypto assets, $1.6 trillion asset manager predicts - Crypto Briefing




Franklin Templeton, a global investment firm managing 1.6 trillion dollars, has released a report titled “Solana: Accelerated Adoption,” which predicts that Solana is positioned to become the third major crypto asset after Bitcoin and Ethereum.The report states, “Our view is that Solana’s growth is likely to continue because it is well positioned to capture the next wave of crypto adoption, solidifying itself as the third major crypto asset after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).”The analysts highlight that Solana has dominated in capturing the surge of crypto activity during this period, particularly driven by major airdrops in the Solana ecosystem, such as Jito and Pyth. “These airdrops created a billion dollar plus wealth effect in the ecosystem, driving SOL and other Solana ecosystem tokens higher, especially meme coins,” the report states.Franklin Templeton’s analysts point out that Solana has seen a significant increase in total fees and decentralized exchange volumes over the past year, indicating strong growth.“In the past year, Solana has seen significant growth demonstrated through an increase in both total fees and DEX volumes on the network,” the report mentions.The asset manager believes that Solana is uniquely qualified to capture the next wave of adoption in several sectors, including decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), payments (especially micropayments), compression NFTs (XNFTs), and centralized limit order books (CLOBs) with payment-for-order-flow. While Solana has experienced congestion issues due to high demand, the developer community is actively working on solutions. One major catalyst expected to address these issues is Firedancer, a Solana validator client developed by Jump Crypto. Franklin Templeton’s growing interest in Solana, as seen in their tweets earlier this year, stems from the firm’s attraction to Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko’s vision and the significant developments in Solana’s ecosystem during Q4 2023, including progress in decentralized prediction markets (DePIN), DeFi, meme coins, NFTs.

As Bitcoin Pumps, These Altcoins Are Doing Even Better - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe global crypto market cap stands at $2.29 trillion, marking a 3.50% increase over the last day, according to CoinMarketCap. Excluding stablecoins, 96% of the Top 100 tokens are registering gains, leaving only LEO, Gnosis, Axelar, and Celestia in bearish territory with less than 1.2% in losses.That closes out the week with at least one bullish day, as Bitcoin is also up over 4% in the last 24 hours and above $61,800 at time of writing, CoinGecko data shows.There are also 64 top coins that are posting better percentual gains than BTC: ORDI, TON, and BONK are among the top performers, each with impressive price movements in the last 24 hours.ORDI, a cryptocurrency that operates within the Ordinals protocol ecosystem based on blockchain technology, is the best-performing token in the top 100 in terms of price appreciation in the last day. ORDI went from $35.50 to $41.60, marking 17.55% growth in the last 24 hours. The coin is almost canceling out the losses of last week and is now down less than 2.5% in the last seven days.ORDI is going through an interesting pattern, even though it's a young coin. The short-term trend is bearish, with the EMA55 above of the EMA10. This is considered bearish because traders need to hold the coin for longer in order to be profitable. It also shows a strong ADX of 26 points.Today's spike is putting the price over the EMA 55, however, which could reduce the breach between the two EMAs and signal a possible bullish bounce over the next few days.In a bullish scenario, ORDI could test a new resistance near $53 for an additional 30% recovery. However, if the bearish trend remains, it could dip around 38% testing support at around $25.50.The second-best performing token in the Top 100 is Toncoin (TON), the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a project started by Telegram and then handed over to the open-source community after a legal tussle with the SEC. TON is up 9.76% in the last 24 hours, going from $5 to $5.52. TON also canceled out last week's losses, registering a weekly gain of 3.2%—9.2% over the last 30 days.In terms of fundamentals, there’s some hype around TON after an announcement by Pantera Capital, a crypto VC firm with over $5 billion in assets under management, of an investment in the TON blockchain. Pantera didn’t disclose the amount of money they put into the development of the TON network, but they didn’t mince words praising the blockchain and its potential.“We believe TON has the capacity to introduce crypto to the masses because it is used extensively within the Telegram network,” Pantera Capital said in its official announcement yesterday.TON seems a little stronger than ORDI, pointing to a stable bullish bounce. The price broke past the resistance of the EMA10, proving it's bullish at least in the short term. The RSI at 50 points shows a balance of forces, and the Squeeze Momentum Indicator is pointing toward an end to the bearish trend and the beginning of a bullish impulse. The coin is currently testing a weak resistance and the margin of operation is low.A bullish scenario puts TON into a zone near $6 for a 12% spike, with a bearish scenario sending the coin back to $4.90 for a price dip of 10.6%.Another coin with an interesting performance is BONK, a Solana-based meme coin that gained popularity in the latest crypto bull run. The coin is up 9.75% in the last 24 hours, going from $0.00002467 to $0.00002716. Like ORDI and TON, it wiped out last week's losses, rising 3.3% in the last 7 days and 16.9% in the last 30 days.Right now, BONK is trading sideways and has remained flat since mid-March. The coin has been bouncing between $0.00002950 and $0.00001940 with an atypical dip in mid-April. The ADX is weak due to the price behavior that is basically trading with no trend. However, the Squeeze Momentum Indicator points to a bullish impulse that may turn into a steady bullish trend.The bullish and bearish scenarios are marked by both support and resistance. An optimistic performance would take the coin to $0.00002950 for a 9% spike, and a pessimistic performance would dip the coin 25% to $0.00001940.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

This is Why XRP and Uniswap Networks Are Growing


XRP and Uniswap have demonstrated a considerable increase in the number of new addresses. 
This growth reflects heightened investor interest and expanding market activity.
XRP and Uniswap See Significant Increase
Ripple’s XRP has experienced a 7% increase in non-empty addresses in the past six months, rising to 5.2 million. According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, this uptick might reflect a broader acceptance of XRP as a mainstream financial asset, drawing new and seasoned investors into its ecosystem.
This growth is corroborated by the XRP Ledger, with a staggering 59.77 billion XRP held within these addresses. Interestingly, only a tiny fraction of these addresses, about 1,939, show zero balances.
On the other hand, Uniswap has also seen a staggering 140% increase in new addresses over the past year. It now stands at 7.26 million addresses, up from 3.03 million in May 2023.


“Uniswap wallets more than doubled in the past year! That’s a 140% increase from 3.03 million in May 2023 to 7.26 million in May 2024. This surge coincides with Uniswap surpassing a historic $2 trillion in cumulative trading volume in early April.” a crypto community leader said.

CRV Teases Recovery Signs as It Closes Week With Green Tick - DailyCoin


        
The native token of Curve Finance is recording minimal gains following its weeks-long decline.



The gradual uptick has seen Curve DAO rebound from its record low value.



The slightly upward momentum of the broader crypto market is fueling recovery optimism.
The recently concluded week was rough for Curve DAO (CRV), the native token of the Curve ecosystem, which struggled to regain balance following a deep sink into an all-time low. Despite market fluctuations rippling through select assets with modest gains, CRV remained stagnant, unable to reverse its downward trajectory.However, in a surprising end to the week, the token may have its sights set on recovery.Curve Climbs 4% on Road to RecoveryAccording to CR V’s trading data on Friday, May 3, the token has fluttered between 3.7% to 4% uptick in the last 24 hours, valued at $0.435. The uptick marks a reversal of fortune for Curve DAO, correcting its week-long lows.  
While only minimal, Curve’s present upward momentum marks an approximate 30% increase from its record low value of $0.33, which it dipped to on April 12 in the wake of a crypto market crash. Source: CoinMarketCap However, the token still sits 36% below its year-opening value of $0.605, and a staggering 93% below its year-high value of over $0.8, dashing the once-heightened excitement for its potential to reclaim a $1 peg.The upward pressure in Curve DAO’s price is likely tied to the modest recovery witnessed in Bitcoin (BTC), which also had a rather challenging week. Currently trading over $61,600 BTC has recorded a total 4.4% uptick over the past day.
This marks a rebound from the token giant’s week-low range of $56,000 to $57,000, sparking recovery hopes across the broader market. Read this to discover the liquidation scare CRV’s all-time low crash triggered for its founder:Curve Founder Eases Contagion Fears, Slashing Debt to $42.7M This coin mixer is adopting preventive measures to avoid the DOJ’s scrutiny, find out more:Wasabi Wallet Exits Mixing Sector as DOJ Pressure Piles on

Bitcoin Bottom In? Retracement From $73,800 Is Deeper And Took Longer To Form


                            Some analysts were frightened by the recent drop in Bitcoin prices. Though the coin is showing signs of strength, multiple leveraged longs were liquidated early this week. 
In a post on X, one analyst thinks Bitcoin might have just found support, bottoming up after the contraction this week, pushing it lower from the multi-week range established in mid-March through to the better part of April.
 Bitcoin Retracement Is Deeper And Took Longer: Bottom In?
Expressing confidence, the analyst cited a historical pattern. Based on a price action assessment in the weekly chart, the analyst notes that whenever Bitcoin posts a deep retracement, there is usually a higher probability of the coin bottoming up and shaking off weakness. 

At the same time, prices tend to recover after a retracement that takes longer than expected.

Building on their historical pattern observation, the analyst applied it to the current BTC situation. The trader said up to the current level, the retracement from an all-time high is deeper and also took longer than usual, spanning several weeks. As a result, the analyst projected a high likelihood that Bitcoin prices might have found a bottom. 
While confidence abounds, it is still challenging to pick bottoms. Bitcoin and crypto assets are volatile, with prices moving quickly in either direction. At spot rates, Bitcoin is trading above $60,000, reversing losses of May 1. 
Even though this might cement the analyst’s position, BTC remains within a bear breakout formation, defined by the wide-ranging, high-volume bear bar of April 30.

Moreover, the coin is still boxed away from the April trade range, suggesting that weakness remains. Should there be a conclusive close above $62,000, the trend will likely shift in favor of bulls, reversing the losses of April 30. 

Before then, aggressive traders might be unloading at higher prices, aligning with the current bearish formation.
Market Forces Will Shape BTC Prices
Despite the bearish outlook, most analysts are bullish, expecting a sharp price recovery. One of them took to X, suggesting that buyers will likely take charge if prices recover from spot rates and return to the horizontal range of March to April.

The pace and direction at which prices move going forward lean on market factors. So far, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers are decreasing their holdings. 
At the same time, the United States Federal Reserve is tracking inflation and other metrics as they tune monetary policy. If inflation drops, the USD will likely strengthen, heaping more pressure on the world’s most valuable crypto.

Bitcoin's price will hold these levels until August - Arthur Hayes - AMBCrypto



Arthur Hayes is predicting a slow upward trend for Bitcoin after hitting a local bottom
Bitcoin’s value will stabilize between $60,000 and $70,000 until August, he added

The last few weeks have been difficult for the crypto-market, with the same marked by a sharp decline in Bitcoin’s value. From a peak of $73,000 in March, Bitcoin has tumbled by over 19%, with a notable 7.8% drop in the past week alone. This steep decline has left investors and market watchers searching for signs of stability and potential recovery paths.
Exec weighs In: A turnaround on the horizon?
However, Arthur Hayes, the former Chief Executive of BitMEX, has shared a glimmer of hope amidst the market’s volatility. In his latest blog post, the exec suggested that Bitcoin has hit a local bottom, while also predicting gradual upward movement in the coming months. 
This perspective offers a contrast to the prevailing market sentiment, which has been largely bearish due to various economic pressures. These include Federal Reserve policy uncertainties and a general slowdown in cryptocurrency investments.
Hayes believes that the recent 12% retreat in Bitcoin’s price was necessary for market correction, attributing it to the U.S. tax season, which often prompts investors to liquidate holdings for tax liabilities. Additionally, he pointed to the “sell the news” effect that has been around since Bitcoin’s latest halving and a deceleration in the growth of assets under management in spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
Market mechanics: Liquidity and future projections
One of the more intriguing aspects of Hayes’s analysis is his discussion on the implications of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening (QT) strategy. He believes that the tapering of QT could lead to increased liquidity in the financial markets, potentially benefiting riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. 
In fact, he described this process as a form of “stealth money printing” that could bolster asset prices, leading to a sustained recovery phase. 
Moreover, Hayes is optimistic about the market’s capacity to absorb these changes and start a slow ascent. He envisages a scenario where the market will stabilize and then commence a gradual climb, mitigating the more drastic price movements seen recently. A far as his price prediction is concerned, Hayes noted, 
“A rally to above $60,000 and then range-bound price action between $60,000 and $70,000 until August.”
Here, it’s worth noting that over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has shown signs of a supposed “slow climb” on the charts. While it hiked to a 24-hour high of $59,966, BTC also recorded a trading volume that exceeded $30 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. 
Melker believes otherwise
Despite these positive projections, however, some analysts are more cautious. According to Scott Melker, for instance, because Bitcoin has broken past crucial support levels, now serving as resistance, this might trigger further price drops. In fact, he believes that a potential freefall to about $52,000 wouldn’t be out of the question.
Melker further claimed that the recent decline is relatively minor, marking only a 23% drop and well in line with previous corrections observed during this cycle. A more significant correction of 30% to 40% is likely during this market phase, he added.

Is Buying XRP A Profitable Trade? Crypto Analyst Says It’s “Dead” | Bitcoinist.com


								XRP has largely had a lackluster price movement in recent months, although it continues to show promise for real-world utility. Particularly, the price of XRP was recently rejected at $0.66 after a little surge which saw it falling back down as far as the $0.42 price level. The crypto now finds itself ranging between $0.6 and $0.4, which means it has failed to break over new price territories for the past two years. 
While some analysts see this trend as XRP still being undervalued, others are of a pessimistic outlook. Analyst Josh Olszewicz is part of the latter group of crypto analysts. In a recent analysis, Olszewicz noted the “dead” state of XRP while discussing the current state of altcoins. 
Current State Of XRP And The Crypto Market
XRP has failed to keep up with the gains of other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. While the total crypto market cap has climbed over 50% in the past year, XRP has lagged. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have broken into new all-time highs and others like Solana are on their way to creating new all-time highs.

XRP on the other hand, has failed to break above $1. This poor performance has led many critics to claim that interest in XRP is fading, especially as an investment asset.
The failure of XRP to break into new price levels was brought to the attention of crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz, who pointed out an interesting position regarding the cryptocurrency.  During his presentation on his technical analysis of altcoins, Olszewicz made the observation that XRP is not particularly ideal for investors who want to make a profit. He essentially referred to the cryptocurrency as “dead.”
“I just don’t know why anybody will bother trading this. It’s at the same price it was since 2018. It’s dead. It’s dead money,” the analyst said regarding XRP.
Is XRP Actually Dead?
Recent market dynamics have seen XRP falling in the market cap rankings. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.515 and is the 7th largest cryptocurrency. Some analysts argue that XRP is primed for significant growth. XRP bulls point to Ripple’s partnerships with major banks and payment providers as a sign of future success. 

Despite the lackluster price growth, XRP remains steady in terms of trading activity. Interestingly, Olszewicz noted that XRP will have days when traders can profit. However, holding while waiting for a longer-term bullish outlook doesn’t make sense to him. 
Crypto analyst EGRAG is of a different opinion. According to him, XRP could surge by over 700% and reach the $4 price level over a longer time frame.

Bitcoin Flashes Potentially Bullish Indicator Amid Crypto Market Downtick, According to Analytics Firm Santiment - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing a potentially bullish indicator amid an overall crypto market downtick, according to the digital asset analytics firm Santiment.
The firm notes in a new post on the social media platform X that the percentage of the BTC network’s available supply in profit is 84.4%.










Explains Santiment,
“This BTC ratio is at its lowest level in 2 months. Lower levels generally justify more bullish conditions.”
Source: Santiment/X
BTC is trading at $59,170 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 2.5% in the past 24 hours but down more than 8% in the past seven days.
A fellow analytics firm, CryptoQuant, looked into potential factors driving the downtick in the BTC market over the past week.
“Market sentiment towards Bitcoin is waning, evident from negative Coinbase premiums and lesser leverage in futures. This decrease in enthusiasm suggests a cautious approach from traders.
A slowdown in BTC demand from large investors (whales) is evident. The growth peaked at 12% monthly in late March, now down to 6%. Such deceleration affects potential price rallies, which rely on robust whale demand.”
Source: Santiment/X
CryptoQuant also notes that miners have been selling off BTC, adding to the market’s supply and “undermining potential price supports.” According to the analytics firm, increased short positions also indicate that traders have been betting on the top crypto asset dropping lower.

Here’s Why One Crypto Analyst Doesn’t Think an Ethereum ETF Will Get Approval Despite ‘Altcoin Bull Market’ - The Daily Hodl


								One widely followed crypto analyst is warning Ethereum (ETH) traders that an ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) is unlikely to happen soon.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 715,800 followers on the social media platform X that traders may have to wait a little longer for an ETH ETF.










“The Ethereum ETF is likely not going to be approved in May.
However, the markets are undervaluing a potential approval in August, as Ethereum is still getting sold off.
I think the chances of an approval in August is positive, through which I expect Ethereum to outperform.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
According to Van de Poppe, the current turbulence of the crypto markets presents an opportunity for crypto investors.
“You wanted to buy Bitcoin at <$60,000.
You wanted to buy Chainlink at <$15.
You wanted to buy any altcoin in a correction.
However, now, emotions kicked in and sentiment expects another drop, while the opportunity is here.
Maybe you don’t feel you want to, but this is the time.”
According to Van de Poppe, he favors trading newer altcoins over the “old” ones.
“Old coins continue to provide bad returns as Polygon (MATIC) is on a cycle low. 
It’s in the area of interest, but you should wonder whether it is going to generate a lot of returns or whether a new coin is going to yield higher upward returns.
To me: I stick to new coins.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
MATIC is currently down 20% in the last month.
The analyst concludes by noting the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) data is helping fuel today’s Bitcoin (BTC) rally and a wider altcoin bull run.
“Terrible economic data -> DXY (US dollar index) down, additionally the case for quarterly earnings and rate cuts will increase and therefore risk-on assets rally.
Bitcoin back to $61,600.
FOMC was the low for the markets and the altcoin bull market has started.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
BTC is worth $61,702 at time of writing, up 4% on the day.

Solana Game ‘Nyan Heroes’ Returning With Expanded Play-to-Airdrop Rewards - Decrypt

Following its initial pre-alpha demo playtest in late March and early April, Overwatch-esque hero shooter Nyan Heroes will bring its online servers back online next week amid a renewed play-to-airdrop push for the Epic Games Store PC title.Nyan Heroes is a team-based shooter with NFT assets and an upcoming token on the Solana blockchain. Its  servers will relaunch beginning May 8, and the second pre-alpha demo playtest period will include a new ranked mode for players.9 Lives Interactive Creative Director and CEO Max Fu told Decrypt that the playtest period is currently slated to last until May 26, though it’s possible that the studio will extend that window.Ahead of the pre-alpha revival, Nyan Heroes has launched the second season of its play-to-airdrop campaign, which will expand the kinds of rewards that players can accumulate—and will translate into an allocation for the game’s eventual NYAN token airdrop on Solana.Previously, players could earn in-game MEOW points for completing an array of rotating in-game quests, which included tasks like playing a certain number of matches, notching a particular number of enemy kills, and so on.In season two, the play-to-airdrop campaign will also add CATNIP points, which rewards for gameplay performance and add a multiplier to players’ airdrop allocations. CATNIP will exist alongside MEOW, and remain in the game during future seasons as well.Players were already able to earn CATNIP during the first season of gameplay, but the rewards functionality was not yet enabled. Those earned points will be carried over into the second season and they will factor into airdrop allocations.CATNIP can also be earned outside the game for social media engagement via Nyan Heroes’ play-to-airdrop dashboard.Nyan Heroes has racked up more than 200,000 downloads to date on the Epic Games Store, according to the studio, and hit a peak of more than 45,000 daily active users during the initial pre-alpha playtest window. The studio says that 20% of users were “Web2 players,” based on its data, suggesting mainstream crossover with the Epic Games Store’s traditional gamer base.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Snowden goes after Bitcoin devs, Elon, and puppy killers in X flurry

Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the United States National Security Agency accused of espionage after leaking classified information, had a busy day on the X social media app on May 2 when he seemed to have a modicum of vitriol for everyone from the current governor of South Dakota to the world’s richest person. Snowden, an outspoken whistleblower who lived in asylum in Russia until 2022, when he was granted full citizenship in the country, has risen to media prominence in the wake of his whistleblower incident. Currently, he holds celebrity status, especially among some technology-based communities and is well known for speaking out on topics he considers related to freedom and privacy. Elon MuskAnother celebrity technologist who’s known for speaking out on issues related to freedom, Elon Musk, was among those who drew the ire of Snowden during his May 2nd tirade. After Musk posted a poll asking whether someone who “tears down the American flag and puts up another flag in its place” should be deported to the country whose flag they raised, Snowden chastised the billionaire with a lesson on freedom of expression. Source: @ElonMusk on X. “First of all,” Snowden began in a post on Musk’s X social media platform, “Americans' freedom of expression, which includes all manner of flag-trampling and other unlikable acts, is constitutionally-protected for a very good reason.” He then asked what would happen if someone replaced the U.S. flag with a flag bearing the McDonald’s logo.In an additional post, Snowden continued:Source: @Snowden on X“Because no law—even one described, like the Constitution, as the "supreme law of the land"—possesses a force of its own; the ink cannot leap from the page to fight for your rights. A law can only defend the people when the people defend the law. Its power derives from our own.”To the best of our knowledge, Musk hasn’t responded. Related: Musk to charge new X users to post, but some say it won’t stop the botsBitcoinOn the subject of Bitcoin, Snowden posted what he called his final warning: Source: @Snowden on X. “I've been warning Bitcoin developers for ten years that privacy needs to be provided for at the protocol level,” he wrote, before adding “This is the final warning. The clock is ticking.”The warning was evidently prompted by news that Wasabi Wallet developer zkSNACKs was shutting down. It’s unclear exactly what Snowden was warning against, but the whistleblower has long been associated with cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin, as a proponent and advocate. Kristi NoemAfter opining on the state of free speech on X and Bitcoin’s future, Snowden turned his barbed commentary on South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem. The embattled republican recently became the target of massive social and traditional media backlash after excerpts from an upcoming book she authored were found to contain the story of her shooting a 14-month-old puppy in the head. Noem has since gone on to defend her actions as allowable under the law and, in subsequent commentary, even gone so far as to say the puppy was untrainable and dangerous. It was these comments, apparently, that set Snowden off and caused him to draw a comparison between excessive force in the field of law enforcement and Noem’s farm animal policies. Source: @Snowden on X. Snowden’s post referred to Noem as a “puppy-killer” adding “OK lady, sure. Soon the police union will tell us that the pup was coming right for her; sudden movement, feared for her life.”

Good Bad News for Crypto | Bankless


Back already? Risk assets pumped this morning following weaker-than-expected employment with Bitcoin up nearly 5%, a surge directly attributable to the increased probability of steeper and sooner interest rate cuts. Why is bad news good for your bags?The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics released employment data for the month of April at 8:30 AM EST this morning (the moment this morning’s BTC rally was incited), showing that non-farm payrolls increased by 175k as the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9%.Non-farm payrolls came in below the consensus expectations for 243k jobs, the series’s worst month since October 2023, and the unemployment rate is now back at 2024 highs despite ticking down slightly after March’s massive employment beat.On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell specifically stated that a weakening labor market could spur the interest rate cuts market participants have eagerly awaited; today’s weakening employment data created massive increases in the odds for a cut.Yields on US Treasuries, which have plummeted throughout the month of May, continued on their trajectory lower as the imminence of rate cuts received further confirmation meanwhile market participants are now pricing in a base case of two interest cuts in 2024.
Policymakers, prolific financial thinkers, and the media apparatus have buttered you up to believe that an economy in decline is somehow a bullish catalyst because it will incite rate cuts, however, this is far from the truth. History demonstrates time-and-time again that rate cuts typically coincide with the deepest points of recession, demonstrating that interest rate manipulation is only one of numerous variables that impact the economy.Fundamentally, bond yields are a reflection of future growth and inflation expectations. Their move lower suggests that there will be no reinflation and that growth is headed lower.Interest rates below the “neutral rate” at which we achieve stable employment and inflation can service an economic boon, but this neutral rate falls sharply into recessions, meaning that rate cuts alone may be inadequate to offset economic decline.The Fed claims to be entirely “data dependent,” but this leaves them focused on lagging data metrics and staring in the rearview mirror; by the time they run over the pedestrian ahead, it will be too late.While near-zero interest rates are certainly nice for capitalized borrowers, they are meaningless when the availability of credit is slim and the quality of borrowers is declining alongside the value of their assets.

Price analysis 5/3: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, DOGE, TON, ADA, AVAX, SHIB

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are trying to stage a comeback by pushing the price above the psychologically crucial level of $60,000. Veteran trader Peter Brandt said in a X post that if Bitcoin holds the most recent lows and moves higher, it will be considered a “very common bull market continuation chart construction.”Analysts are bullish on the long-term prospects of Bitcoin but do not expect the uptrend to start in a hurry. Bitfinex Alpha market report said that Bitcoin could stay range-bound for one to two months “with swings of $10,000 on either side.”Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Traders are likely to keep a close watch on the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. According to Farside Investors data, the Bitcoin ETFs witnessed outflows of $563 million on May 1. The sentiment is likely to pick up after the Bitcoin ETFs witness net inflows for a few successive days. Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes believes the sell-off has ended, and the crypto markets may head higher.What important resistance levels may act as a roadblock for the recovery? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin is taking support in the zone between the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $58,017 and the 61.8% retracement level of $54,298.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bulls pushed the price back above the breakdown level of $59,600 on May 3, indicating that the recent fall may have been a bear trap. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to stall the relief rally at the 20-day exponential moving average ($63,366) and then at the 50-day simple moving average ($66,151).If the price turns down from the moving averages, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then make one more attempt to sink the BTC/USDT pair below $56,500. If they succeed, the pair may slump to $54,298.Conversely, a break above the 50-day SMA will suggest that the pair may extend its stay inside the range for some more time.Ether price analysisEther (ETH) fell below the $2,850 support on May 1, but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid demand at lower levels.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 45 show that the bears have a slight edge. If the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA ($3,152), the bears will try to yank the ETH/USDT pair to the support line of the descending channel pattern.Contrarily, if the price rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the selling pressure could be reducing. The bulls will have thrust the pair above the resistance line to indicate the end of the downtrend.BNB price analysisBNB (BNB) has been oscillating inside the large range between $495 and $635 for the past several days, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf the price sustains below the moving averages, the BNB/USDT pair could slide to the strong support at $495. Buyers are likely to buy this level and keep the range intact. However, if the bears prevail, the pair could start a downtrend to $460 and thereafter to $400.Instead, if the price rises above the moving averages, the pair could climb to the overhead resistance of $635. This is a significant resistance for the bears to defend because a break above it could catapult the pair to $692.Solana price analysisThe bears pulled Solana (SOL) below the $126 support but could not maintain the lower levels, indicating buying by the bulls. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe SOL/USDT pair has reached the 20-day EMA ($145), an important level to watch out for.

Dutch authorities arrest suspect in ZKasino gambling scam, seize $12.2 million in assets

The Netherlands’ Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) announced the arrest of a 26-year-old suspected to be involved in the ZKasino decentralized gambling platform scam.Meanwhile, speculations within the crypto community suggest that the arrested person could potentially be the pseudonymous founder of the platform known as Derivatives Monke.Asset seizuresIn the wake of the arrest, Dutch authorities revealed the seizure of assets, including digital assets, real estate, and luxury vehicles, worth around 11.4 million euros ($12.2 million).Meanwhile, this arrest signals a pivotal development in the ZKasino fraud case, in which investors suffered losses exceeding $33 million in Ethereum. The platform initially pledged a 30-day investment return guarantee but later diverted users’ ETH to the Ethereum-based liquid staking protocol Lido.According to Dutch authorities, the platform’s smart contract configuration strongly indicated that it did not intend to refund the funds.FIOD added:“During the investigation the FIOD worked closely with staff from the Financial Crime Compliance and Investigations Team of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which helped secure millions of euros in cryptocurrencies.”Simultaneously, Dutch authorities assured the stolen funds would be restituted to the victims. However, they underscored the importance of victim cooperation and encouraged the sharing of any pertinent information to aid ongoing investigations.Community celebratesMembers of the crypto community on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) have expressed satisfaction with news of the arrest, viewing it as a significant stride towards recovering their funds and attaining justice.Concurrently, the perusal of a chat group established by ZKasino victims showed a collective willingness to collaborate with law enforcement agencies. Notably, they are already anticipating that the authorities would secure the arrest of other culprits.A user identified as Pursuit of Profit on Telegram said.“The Dutch intelligence service are monsters! The best out there, now that they got him in custody and seized his electronic devices, they will locate every one of them involved in the scam based on digital footprints from communications etc. Just wait for it.”Latest Netherlands Stories

Wasabi Wallet Exits Mixing Sector as DOJ Pressure Piles on - DailyCoin


        
Coin mixer Wasabi Wallet will discontinue its conjoin coordination service.



The move comes amid intensifying enforcement actions from US authorities.



The Wasabi wallet conjoin feature suspension will impact other wallet service providers.
From Tornado Cash to Samourai Wallet, privacy-focused crypto mixers have dominated industry headlines in recent months, drawing attention to intense regulatory drama and market exits. On April 29, 2024, zkSNACKs-owned Wasabi Wallet was added to the list, announcing its exit from the United States, completely restricting user access to its services within the jurisdiction. Less than a week after the key decision, the firm announced the discontinuation of its coin mixing service, prompting questions about the reason behind its recent flurry of actions.Wasabi Wallet Axes Conjoin Feature: Fear of the DOJ?Revealed in a blog post on May 2, 2024, Wasabi Wallet’s decision comes amidst intensified enforcement actions from the Department of Justice, as the company seeks to evade potential scrutiny of its offerings by United States authorities.
According to the firm, the conjoin coordination suspension, which will take effect on June 1, 2024, aligns with its efforts to operate “under legal clarity,” echoing the concerns stated for its US market exit.“This decision was made after careful consideration and with a heavy heart. Throughout our history, we have always made efforts to operate under legal clarity. At this point, we need to regain more certainty before moving forward,” stated the blog post. While it will no longer offer complete privacy, the wallet emphasized that it will continue to function as a Bitcoin wallet and maintain other privacy features, such as its client-side filtering architecture, Tor integration, and custom coin selection.Wasabi Wallet’s decision follows a series of preventive measures undertaken by other coin-mixing service providers amid increased efforts to avoid the DoJ’s line of fire.DoJ Cracks on Crypto MixersIn August 2023, authorities initiated legal proceedings against popular crypto mixer Tornado Cash, alleging its frequent adoption by hackers to conceal traces of their illicitly acquired funds.
The DoJ accused the firm of facilitating nearly $1 billion in illegal transactions for sanctioned organizations such as the North Korean-linked hacker group Lazarus, charging its principal co-founders, Roman Storm, and Roman Semenov, for aiding cybercrime and violating regulations.Nearly a year later, authorities turned their attention to the Bitcoin mixer Samourai Wallet for similar charges. Alleging the facilitation of $2.1 billion in illegal transactions. On April 24, 2024, the Justice Department arrested Samourai founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill, indicting them on charges of money laundering and sanctions violations.The two Samourai Wallet founders, Keonne Rodriguez and William Longman Hill have also been arrested by the DOJ, facing a 25-year sentence each if convicted.On the Flipside
Crypto mixers have been labeled as aiding terror financing, and the recent rise in geopolitical tensions, such as the Israel-Iran conflict, could be a contributing factor to the heightened crackdown on crypto mixers.



Following Wasabi Wallet’s announcement, hardware wallet provider Trezor, which utilized the coinjoin feature, also declared the discontinuation of its service.



The arrested Samourai Wallet co-founder, Keonne Rodriguez has recently pleaded not guilty to the DoJ’s charges.
Why This MattersWasabi Wallet’s suspension of the coinjoin coin mixing feature highlights its compliance and efforts to avoid potential legal repercussions from the Department of Justice (DoJ). However, even with the preventive measures, the firm may still be subject to enforcement if linked to previous illicit activities.Discover the FBI’s cautions to investors as crypto mixer crackdown continues:FBI Warns Americans as Crypto Enforcement Actions Intensify Indian authorities and Binance have recently busted a fraudulent crypto scheme, read more:Binance Collaborates With Indian Authorities to Nab $10M Scam

Bitcoin Needs To Cross New 'Line In The Sand' To Confirm It Was A 'Fake Dip': 10x Research - Benzinga

Crypto research firm 10x Research on Thursday highlighted a crucial chart that Bitcoin BTC/USD traders should be monitoring closely.What Happened: In its latest newsletter titled “Fake Dip?” 10x Research pointed out that Bitcoin’s relative strength has retraced back to 40%, which has been associated with rally attempts on three occasions since early 2023. The firm also identified a new “line in the sand” at $62,000, where they might change their view if Bitcoin fails to break above this level quickly.The newsletter mentioned four instances where Bitcoin broke below a triangle support level but quickly reversed due to various bullish news or events:
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s proposal for uncapped deposit insurance.



Blackrock’s filing for a Bitcoin ETF.



Franklin Templeton joining the Bitcoin ETF race.



A drop in U.S. Core PCE below 3.0%.
Read Also: ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Robert Kiyosaki Unveils His Bitcoin Strategy Amid Market Crash: ‘The Best Time To Get Rich'Why It Matters: The current triangle breakdown appears more severe than the previous four instances, and the distribution pattern resembles a top rather than a sideways move. 10x Research’s trend model is currently in a downtrend, similar to January 2024, while it was in a bull trend during the other three dips.The research firm emphasizes that the longer Bitcoin stays below the $62,000 level, the more difficult it will become to break above it again. While their three reversal indicators remain bearish, they are open to the possibility of buying this dip if Bitcoin falls deep enough or rallies, although this is not their base case scenario.The research firm had previously cautioned that prices might fall another 20% and drop into the low $50,000s.What’s Next: These topics are expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Now Read: Why Bitcoin Spiked Above $62,000 Following The April Jobs ReportThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Major Fraud Case: Victim Sends $71 Million in Bitcoin to Fraudster's Wallet with His Own Hands - Bitcoin Sistemi


A wallet lost 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), worth over $71 million, due to a sophisticated phishing attack known as 'address poisoning'.
The incident occurred approximately six hours ago when the victim created a new address as “0xd9A1b0B1e1aE382DbDc898Ea68012FfcB2853a91” and transferred 0.05 Ether (ETH) to this new address. In a cunning move, the fraudster created an address with the same initials and ending letters and transferred 0 ETH to the victim, causing the transfer to appear in the transaction history.


Many wallets hide the middle part of the address with “…” for a cleaner user interface. When the victim wanted to transfer his WBTC to his new address, he accidentally copied the scammer's address with the same starting and ending letters. As a result, they transferred 1,155 WBTC worth $71 million directly to the fraudster.

Address poisoning is a type of attack where the hacker creates a wallet address similar to the victim's through spoofed address services or address mining and spams the victim with a large number of transactions. If the victim accidentally copies the hacker's fake address, they will accidentally transfer their funds to the hacker instead of their own wallet.





Changpeng Zhao, former CEO of Binance, explained that such attacks can be deceptively effective. “Scammers are now so good at generating addresses with the same starting and ending letters that most people only check this when transferring cryptocurrency,” Zhao wrote in a social media post following a similar security incident in August 2023.

LayerZero demands sybil airdrop farmers to self-report - Crypto Briefing




LayerZero, a protocol enabling connections between incompatible blockchains, has given sybil airdrop farmers an opportunity to self-report their addresses by May 17 in exchange for a reduced token allocation.According to LayerZero, those who decide to come forward will receive 15% of their intended allocation, while those who do not are at risk of receiving “nothing” from the planned token airdrop.Sybil airdrop farming refers to an ostensibly deceptive practice where individuals engage in Sybil attacks by creating multiple fake identities or accounts to exploit airdrop programs.A Sybil attack is enacted when an individual creates numerous false accounts to gain an unfair advantage, such as receiving more airdrop tokens than legitimately entitled. This behavior has been deemed unethical for undermining the perceived fairness and security of airdrop programs, although many in the space still use it as a method. A blog post from LayerZero details how the project plans to address the issue and implement sybil filtering methods used to detect mercenary airdrop farming activity are implemented. Notably, some of the filtering parameters include minting valueless NFTs and spamming low-value transactions across multiple blockchains to register activity.Sybil activity, where users adopt tactics such as creating multiple addresses to increase their share of an airdrop, is a significant issue for crypto projects. This is particularly true when an airdrop is anticipated, as user activity often declines once the token distribution occurs, with mercenary farmers moving their funds to projects that have yet to distribute tokens.“We are giving all sybil users an opportunity to self-report within the next 14 days in return for 15% of their intended allocation, no questions asked,” LayerZero stated in the X postLayerZero itself has experienced a decline in user activity since announcing its airdrop snapshot. According to data from the protocol’s onchain explorer, daily cross-chain transactions fell from around 300,000 on April 30, the day before the airdrop announcement, to about 150,000 currently, representing a drop of more than 50%.To counter the mass exit of users post-airdrop, some crypto projects have begun adopting a process of distributing tokens in multiple rounds.Protocols such as decentralized exchange Jupiter and Ethereum restaking platform EigenLayer have chosen this approach. On this end, speculation has arisen that LayerZero may follow suit, as the team stated that the May 1 snapshot was the first for the airdrop, suggesting the possibility of future snapshots.

Crypto Expert Turns Bullish On Bitcoin, Predicts Quantitative Easing Will Begin Soon


                            Crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe has made a bullish case for Bitcoin as he alluded to macroeconomic factors that could soon play out in the flagship crypto’s favor. In line with this, he urged Bitcoin investors to take action with a parabolic surge on the horizon. 
An Imminent Quantitative Easing Would Be Good For Bitcoin
Van de Poppe suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin will rise on the back of a Quantitative Easing (QE), which he anticipates is “close.” He noted that the Fed has already started to “unwind Treasury buybacks and is reducing QT [Quantitative Tightening].” He claims this is happening because the economic data has worsened, which puts the US at risk of a recession. 

Therefore, the Fed seeks to avoid this recession by buying back long-term government bonds and injecting liquidity into the financial system. As the crypto expert predicts, this could be good since it will force the Fed to take a more dovish stance and possibly lower interest rates, boosting investors’ confidence to go all in on risk assets like Bitcoin. 
Van de Popper further predicts that this Quantitative Easing will become evident in the data released in the coming months. In line with this, he advised investors to long Bitcoin. It is worth noting that Bitcoin dropped to as low as $57,000 ahead of the latest FOMC meeting, with many investors seeming to have anticipated a hawkish stance from the Fed. 
However, as the crypto expert noted, the rates remain unchanged, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised the possibility of a rate cut as early as June. Given Bitcoin’s price recovery since then, this development looks to have already revived a bullish sentiment among investors. 
What To Expect Going Forward
In another X post, Van de Popper revealed his expectations for the crypto market going forward. He stated that Bitcoin will consolidate and go sideways (possibly ahead of the QE which will boost its price in the coming months. Meanwhile, he also expects Altcoins to “heavily outperform and rotation kicks in.”

The crypto expert had previously echoed a similar sentiment when he stated that he expects altcoins to bounce in their Bitcoin pairs while Bitcoin faces a period of consolidation that he doesn’t expect to change in the “coming months.” 
Back then, he also mentioned that there would be a narrative shift to Ethereum, and he reaffirmed this belief in a more recent X post, stating that he expects a lot from the second-largest crypto token by market cap.  
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $59,100, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Crypto Biz: The Bitcoin summer, Avalanche integrates with Stripe, and more

While developers have long focused on the Ethereum network, the Bitcoin ecosystem is making a comeback, with several initiatives now aiming to innovate on the original blockchain.Recent developments include the growing ties between Bitcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi), driving the demand for layer-2 protocols to unclog the Bitcoin blockchain and reduce transaction fees as on-chain activity soars.Major players like Coinbase are also reviewing Bitcoin offerings. The crypto exchange finally added the Lightning Network as an alternative for users seeking to transfer Bitcoin (BTC), following Binance’s similar move nearly a year ago. Meanwhile, software firm Animoca Brands has partnered with the Opal Foundation — a new Bitcoin ecosystem protocol — to enter the Bitcoin industry.The introduction of Runes on the Bitcoin blockchain has ignited further buzz. The new token standard was launched on April 20, allowing fungible tokens to be created on the network. Rune transactions have added over 1,200 BTC worth of transaction fees to miners in less than 10 days.This week’s Crypto Biz features the Lightning Network rollout on Coinbase, Avalanche integrating with Stripe, MicroStrategy earning results and a tokenized fund from BlackRock. Avalanche integrates with Stripe for fiat-to-crypto onboardingThe Avalanche C-Chain network has integrated with payment firm Stripe, allowing verified Stripe users to buy Avalanche’s (AVAX) token and send it to their wallets, according to the network’s developer, Ava Labs. Eight Avalanche Web3 apps have also been integrated with the platform. According to the post, Avalanche app developers can now embed a customizable widget into their interfaces, allowing users to convert fiat to crypto via Stripe’s platform. The integration attempts to solve the “cold start problem” in Web3, the post stated, which occurs when “customers don’t have enough funds in their wallets to carry out transactions on the platform.” To solve this issue, Stripe will handle “all the KYC, payments, fraud, and compliance,” allowing the developer to focus on the app itself.Source: AvalancheMicroStrategy Q1 net loss hits $53.1 million, but Bitcoin buying spree continuesMicroStrategy reported a net loss of $53.1 million in the first quarter of 2024, largely due to a $191.6 million impairment loss on digital assets, which was significantly higher than the previous year. The firm’s revenue also decreased by 5.5% to $115.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. Under traditional accounting methods, their Bitcoin holdings were valued at $5.07 billion but would have been marked at $15.2 billion if valued at fair market price, reflecting a 65% increase in Bitcoin’s value during the quarter. The company continued to acquire more Bitcoin in April, and it now holds 214,400 BTC worth $13.5 billion, bought at an average purchase price of $35,180.BlackRock’s BUIDL becomes the world’s largest tokenized treasury fundThe BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) has become the largest treasury fund tokenized on the blockchain, overtaking Franklin Templeton’s similar fund. With a market cap of $375 million, BlackRock’s recently launched BUIDL fund has exceeded the $368 million market cap of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (BENJI), which has been around for a year, according to data from Dune Analytics. Last week, BUIDL attracted $70 million, including a significant investment from Ondo Finance. During the same period, BENJI saw a 3.7% decrease in its assets under management. Across various blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon and Solana, over $1.2 billion in U.S. Treasurys is now tokenized.Coinbase integrates Lightning Network for Bitcoin transactionsCoinbase now supports the Bitcoin Lightning Network, offering users the option of transferring Bitcoin using Lightning or the Bitcoin network. Using the Lightning Network, Coinbase customers can transfer Bitcoin more quickly and cheaply than transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. Transfers on Lightning are “instant,” in contrast to transfers on the Bitcoin network, which may take 10 minutes to two hours because of the limited number of transactions per second the Bitcoin network processes. To use the Lightning Network, the intended recipient sends an invoice consisting of a lengthy string of characters that Coinbase will recognize as the amount of the transfer. In some cases, Lightning transfers may take several hours or fail because of a unique implementation or fee structure, Coinbase warned on April 30.Crypto Biz is your weekly pulse on the business behind blockchain and crypto, delivered directly to your inbox every Thursday.

Your Free Tokens Are Not Available | Bankless


EigenLayer’s token drop was announced on Monday, but plenty of users across the globe were disgruntled that the claim page for EIGEN is "Not Available" to them!Who can't claim?Not only are residents from a expansive list of nations including the U.S. banned from claiming EIGEN, the claims site explicitly blocks users from interacting with the frontend via VPN or other proxy technologies! The extensive list of countries excluded from the EIGEN drop.This restriction came as a shock to some existing users due to unfettered access to the EigenLayer frontend otherwise, and limited communication from the protocol on their plans for aggressive geo-blocking.While EigenLayer is far from the first protocol to pursue some of these limitations in their token distribution, the outsized EIGEN opportunity is leading users in impacted geographies to wonder whether they will continue to be excluded from future gains until regulators get their act together.The New Normal for Airdrops?Considering the hostile and unclear regulatory backdrop crypto protocols are forced to operate under, disappointments like the EIGEN claim restrictions are becoming more and more common.Amid a lack of clear guidance from existing statutes and the refusal of American financial system regulators to provide satisfactory guidelines for digital assets, protocol operators and token issuers are left guessing how to best avoid the scrutiny of agencies such as the SEC.This lack of regulatory clarity has infested every corner of the crypto industry, making it exceedingly difficult for users to access crypto protocols and often prohibiting users from accessing the free money which their onchain interactions entitled them to claim.
Because the presence of token distributions to American (and sanctioned) users can easily place crypto protocols within the jurisdiction of various American regulators, projects frequently block IP addresses originating from America and nations sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).While teams had historically sought to mitigate potential liability by simply banning IP addresses from restricted nations, a September 2023 settlement made between the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and DeFi derivatives platform Opyn indicates that regulators believed their blocking of IPs was insufficient at prohibiting restricted users from accessing the platform, placing it within the jurisdiction of U.S. regulators.
This approach is not unique to EigenLayer and has been adopted for numerous airdrop distributions, such as Celestia’s TIA, and implemented by certain bluechip protocols to prevent unauthorized access to their frontends, including MakerDAO’s Spark lending protocol.To minimize the potential for American regulators to target their projects while still preserving access to their decentralized protocol and maintaining the ability to launch tokens, many projects have now resorted to completely banning VPNs, eliminating any possibility that users from restricted nations can access their products.Thankfully, there are still avenues for restricted users to access these protocols, either via directly interacting with smart contracts onchain or physically changing their location, but unfortunately, it appears highly likely that the stringent combination of geoblocking and VPN restriction will be the norm for the majority of token issuers going forward.Airdrop hunters would be keen to anticipate and prepare for geographical token claim restrictions whenever engaging with early stage projects, regardless of whether they can interact with the underlying protocol via its frontend.

MakerDAO unveils two new tokens in a major overhaul - CoinJournal



                    

                    
The two new tokens teased by MakerDAO are NewStable (NST) and NewGovToken (NGT).
NST replaces Dai and offers upgraded features while NGT replaced MKR and empowers broader governance participation.
Existing Dai and MKR holders will have the choice to transition to the new tokens or continue using their current assets.

MakerDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization that oversees the Maker Protocol, has announced the introduction of two new tokens – NewStable (NST) and NewGovToken (NGT).
These tokens mark a significant milestone in MakerDAO’s evolution, offering enhanced stability and governance features within its ecosystem.
NewStable (NST) token
The NewStable (NST) token represents an upgraded version of Dai, designed to promote broader adoption and provide advanced stability features.
Existing Dai holders will have the option to seamlessly upgrade to NST while retaining the flexibility to convert their holdings back to Dai at any time.
Additionally, NST holders will be able to participate in farming activities to earn NewGovToken (NGT) from the moment of launch.
NewGovToken (NGT) token
The NewGovToken (NGT) token serves as the new governance token within the MakerDAO ecosystem, offering Maker (MKR) holders the opportunity to upgrade their tokens.
Each MKR token will convert to 24,000 NGT during the upgrade process, strategically redenominated to encourage broader engagement in governance activities. This initiative aims to enable more users to hold a significant number of NGT, empowering them to actively influence the future direction of the MakerDAO ecosystem.
MakerDAO expanding its offerings while maintaining flexibility
With the introduction of NST and NGT, MakerDAO is expanding its offerings while maintaining flexibility for users.
The upcoming brand reveal will mark the official introduction of these tokens into the ecosystem, providing users with access to new features and opportunities.
In addition to the token launch, MakerDAO is also exploring investment opportunities to further strengthen its ecosystem. Plans include a substantial investment of $600 million in DAI into USDe and staked USDe (sUSDe) through Morpho Labs’ DeFi lending protocol. These investments aim to support the development and growth of stablecoin assets within the DeFi space.

Most Dogecoin Holders Didn't Buy the Elon Musk Top - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsElon Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency is far, far away from an all-time high price of $0.73 set in 2021. But for a majority of Dogecoin holders, there’s little reason to tuck their tail in between their legs.Some 77% of Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are in the money—meaning the cryptocurrency’s price is above what it was relative to when people bought it—according to IntoTheBlock. With 21% of Dogecoin holders posting paper losses, that leaves a 2% sliver of holders at breakeven.The original meme coin with a market capitalization of $20 billion was created in 2013 as a joke, but it has a semi-serious place in the Tesla CEO’s heart. Based on a popular meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, a cadre of canine-themed coins have steadily spawned in Dogecoin’s wake.Though Musk’s Dogecoin posts have largely petered off, his cheerleading on Twitter spurred Dogecoin’s ascent in 2021. DOGE set its peak price of $0.73 early on May 8, 2021—just hours before Musk was set to appear on "Saturday Night Live." Meme coin investors prayed that his prominent hosting role would propel DOGE, perhaps even to the fabled $1.00 mark.Instead, the opposite happened. The token buckled over 20% in roughly an hour as Elon and his mom poked fun at Dogecoin, and he joked that it was "a hustle" during the show's "Weekend Update" segment. It's never recovered since.Though some believe meme coins are undermining the long-term vision of crypto, meme coin mania can lead some traders to outsized returns. For others, risky bets can sour quickly as the crypto market oscillates with hallmark volatility.The price of Dogecoin had risen 5% over the past day to $0.14, as of this writing, according to CoinGecko. Still, the cryptocurrency’s price has fallen 21% over the past 30 days—notably off from multi-year highs of $0.22 in March.When it comes to the extent of holders’ paper gains, however, it appears Dogecoin isn’t top dog relative to other meme coins boasting a furry, four-legged mascot. That title currently belongs to the Ethereum-based meme coin Floki, with 83% of holders situated in the money.Toward the tail end of the pack, 60% of Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders have profits on paper. (IntoTheBlock doesn’t report data on the Solana-based DogWifHat or Bonk.) Meanwhile, 75% of holders for the meme coin Pepe are in the green.Drawing on everything from pop culture to internet memes—and even celebrity deaths—meme coins are distinct as a subgroup of digital assets that often offer little to no utility. Instead, they move mostly on vibes. Sometimes, though, they disappear entirely.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

SHIB Shibarium Boosts Speed with Augmented Hard Fork Changes - DailyCoin


        
Shibarium devs enhance Layer-2’s infrastructure with a double hard fork.



Shiba Inu (SHIB) soared above $0.000023 as the first installment went live.



SHIB Army members enquired about the long-awaited auto-burning portal.
Developers at Shiba Inu (SHIB) have announced a smooth transition to the new version of Shibarium Layer-2. As planned, Shibarium’s blockchain underwent a hard fork on May 2, 2024, at the block height of 4504576. This was confirmed by Shibarium Network’s official X handle on Thursday evening.Met with greetings and encouragement from the Shiba Inu community, this hard fork on Shibarium is slated to bring a couple of key improvements as Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain is soon to turn one year old. Directed at enhancing user experience, one of the key changes is going to be predictable gas fees and a substantially faster transaction speed.Bi-Folded Shibarium Hard Fork ExplainedA second part of this hard fork is set to occur at block height 3941864. The already implemented upgrade is referred to as Bor and is centered around state sync confirmation, which significantly accelerates performance.
The latter part of Shibarium’s hard fork is called the Heimdall, which is supposed to bring “deterministic finality” to Shibarium’s blockchain. In other words, Heimdall brings a stable and more reliable gas fee distribution on-chain, meaning that crypto enthusiasts who are using Shibarium in ultra-high traffic times won’t pay disproportionate gas fees.Aside from fixing the fluctuating gas fee issues during times of heavy demand, Shiba Inu’s developers have also fixed the bugs in relation to its non-fungible token (NFT) mechanism.On the Flipside
Many SHIB custodians have drawn attention to the highly anticipated auto-burning function, which was meant to be included in one of the major Shibarium upgrades.
Why This MattersShiba Inu’s focus on building a digital infrastructure for the vibrant community of SHIB holders has already borne fruit through a selection of services, ranging from a self-custodial digital identity to an upcoming Layer-3 blockchain.

Bitfinex whales bolster Bitcoin holdings by 6% amid recent price surge | CryptoSlate

Quick TakeOver the past few days, Bitfinex has recorded a substantial 6% increase in Bitcoin (BTC) long positions held by whales — totaling a staggering 48,615 BTC.BTCUSD Longs: Bitfinex: (Source: TradingView)Analyzing Bitfinex whale activity in 2024 reveals a clear pattern: On Feb. 10, these whales held over 76,000 BTC, but by March’s all-time high, the holdings had decreased to 42,000 BTC.Notably, Bitfinex whales anticipated the flagship crypto’s subsequent decline from its peak of approximately $73,500 to $56,500 on May 1. Since hitting their lowest position on April 13, Bitfinex whales have steadily increased their holdings.Amid BTC’s recent surge from $56,500 to $62,000 over the past two days, Bitfinex whales have continued to reinforce their positions.Historical trends suggest that Bitfinex whale activity often serves as a reliable indicator of price direction. When Bitcoin prices peak, whale-long positions tend to bottom out, and these entities have capitalized on market dips to increase their position. Conversely, as prices ascend, whales gradually offload their positions.

Render Network - A Blockchain-Powered Compute Marketplace for Graphics and AI-Based Projects | Cryptoglobe


                                
The world of visual storytelling is constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. From breathtaking 3D animations to captivating special effects and the exciting possibilities of AI-generated visuals, the demand for rendering power continues to skyrocket. Finding accessible and affordable solutions is crucial for creators, studios, and now, even AI developers. This is where the Render Network (RNDR) shines.



The Render Network is a groundbreaking decentralized platform designed to connect those who need rendering power with those who have idle GPUs (graphics processing units) to offer. It functions as a vast, distributed supercomputer dedicated to rendering tasks.



Here’s how it works: Creators who need their projects rendered submit them to the Render Network. Individuals or companies (Node operators) offer their spare GPU power, and the network matches the right resources for the job. Once the rendering is complete, creators pay for the service using RNDR, the network’s native cryptocurrency. In return, Node Operators earn RNDR for contributing their computing resources.



The RNDR token is the lifeblood of the Render Network, facilitating payments for rendering services and incentivizing users to share their resources.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Beyond its core rendering capabilities, Render Network holds immense potential for the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Here’s why:



Accelerating AI Training: Training certain AI models, especially those dealing with image or video generation, can be incredibly resource-intensive. Render Network’s distributed GPU power could significantly speed up this process.Scaling AI Inference: Even after training, some AI models require substantial computing power to make inferences. Render Network offers a potential avenue for cost-effective and scalable AI inference.Distributed AI Workloads: Certain AI applications benefit from splitting tasks across multiple machines – a model well-suited to Render Network’s architecture.



Render Network is actively forging a path within the AI landscape. Collaborations with projects like Stability AI signal the platform’s commitment to supporting and optimizing AI workflows. As it continues to evolve, Render Network could become an invaluable asset for both rendering tasks and AI innovation.







At the time of writing (8:25 p.m. UTC on May 3), RNDR is trading at around $8.33, up 7.36% in the past 24-hour period and 88.88% year-to-date.

EigenLayer Airdrop Outcry Shows Points are Raising Traders' Expectations - The Defiant

Eigen Layer airdropped tokens this week and there was huge backlash. Some criticism was more warranted than others but beyond allocation levels and tokenomics, the main reason the outcry was so fierce is because traders felt a social contract was broken.First, the details. EigenLayer distributed 5% of its 1.67 billion token supply this week. This was the first phase of its airdrop, which will distribute 15% of token supply to its users.Reminder that EigenLayer is DeFi’s third-largest protocol, with almost $15 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. It enables users to re-stake their Ether or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to earn additional yield by securing third-party applications called Actively Validated Services (AVS).This was a hugely anticipated airdrop – it basically mobilized an entire sector within Ethereum. For months, EigenLayer has awarded points to restakers based on the size of their deposits and how long they participated in restaking. Then, liquid restaking protocols started giving out their own points, which would compound on top of EigenLayer points to users staking there.Free Money ExpectationsTraders’ expectations that they’ll get what’s essentially “free money,” is in part what has driven over $15 billion to EigenLayer, and $10 billion to the liquid restaking sector as a whole.So, all those traders farming points and staking ETH and LSTs and LRTs had been waiting for this airdrop.But it was a disappointment to many of them and the backlash was so intense, it actually pushed EigenLayer to change the terms of the drop.Five Main PointsThe main points the EigenLayer community criticized were:EigenLayer excluded liquid restaking protocols from the dropEigen excluded users from major jurisdictions including the United States and CanadaOnly 5% of tokens were airdroppedThe linear allocation of tokens.EIGEN tokens are initially non-transferable.Let’s get the easy ones out of the way: EigenLayer excluded liquid restaking protocols from the drop, but they said they would include these in their Phase 2. The Eigen Foundation said it’s already been in touch with these teams to coordinate the airdrop.Next, the point that EigenLayer also excluded users from countries including the United States, Canada, Korea, Russia and China. This is of course because of regulatory concerns. The list of excluded countries goes on and on.In this case, I think criticism is founded, especially with regards to excluding the U.S. It is reasonable to believe that a large chunk of Eigen’s TVL comes from U.S. users. Looking at traffic for crypto websites, at least half comes from the U.S. That’s where active investors in crypto are, and where people who actually have money to invest in DeFi protocols are.Some people said, “Eigen had no issues taking money from all these risky jurisdictions, but it’s being extra careful in giving money away.” I think they’re right to call a double standard here. You can’t have it both ways.“Never Promised an Airdrop"I’ve also seen an argument that goes, “people are crying because they didn’t get an airdrop they were never promised.”To me that should be almost insulting to any web3 native. If you’re giving away points, especially if you have billions in TVL, $100 million in VC investment, and have either announced or hinted there’s a token coming up, it’s expected those points will correspond to tokens down the line.To put it in crypto terms, this is social consensus. It’s learned behavior in a community that has become a social contract. By incentivizing users with points so that they stake their money, but then not following through with the corresponding tokens, EigenLayer essentially broke that social contract.“Only 5% of Tokens”Next criticism is that “only” 5% of tokens were airdropped. This is an interesting one. The question is, is this in line with other airdrops or is it an outlier?First, it’s important to keep in mind that total airdrop accounts for 15% of total supply.If that were the total share reserved for the community, then that would indeed be extremely low. For context, token allocations saved an average of 40% of tokens to community incentives or distributions in 2023, according to a report by Liquify. Community allocation has been around 40% since 2019, the report shows.But EigenLayer is also allocating 15% of tokens to community initiatives and 15% to ecosystem development. Added all together, this community pool equals 45% – in line with what’s been the norm.In terms of the 15% allocation for the airdrop, that’s also in line with what most major projects have done. Uniswap’s airdrop was for 15% of token supply, Arbitrum’s was for 12.75%, and Jito was for 10%, according to research by IntoTheBlock.I think the reason why 15% felt like a smaller share, is because tokens were distributed among more people. There were 280,000 eligible wallets in the airdrop, compared with 250,000 wallets in the Uniswap airdrop, for instance. And that’s because points had signaled an airdrop was coming, and so more people were incentivized to re-stake ETH and participate in the ecosystem.Guaranteed MinimumNext criticism was the linear allocation of tokens, meaning eligible wallets receive EIGEN proportionally to the points they hold. For example, a wallet holding 100 Eigen points will receive 100 EIGEN. The Eigen Foundation said it chose the linear distribution approach to prevent Sybil attacks, where an individual could use multiple addresses and bots to claim a disproportionately large share of the airdrop.The big criticism here is that the small stakers are at a disadvantage.EigenLayer initially tried to balance things out for small stakers by setting aside roughly 1% of the Season 1 tokens to guarantee that each restaker gets at least 10 EIGEN. After the outcry they increased this minimum level by 100, meaning all Season 1 users will receive a minimum of 110 EIGEN.Non-TransferabiltyThe other criticism EigenLayer addressed is that EIGEN tokens are initially non-transferable, meaning that holders will not be able to sell their tokens.Eigen said the reason why they made the token non-transferable is to allow for community discussion of EIGEN’s novel design, parameters, and proposed implementation; that they wanted key payments and slashing features to be well established; and to enhanced decentralization by allowing for a broader distribution of EIGENs, including through the 15% reserved for future stakedrop seasons.The reason why it’s problematic to make the token non-transferrable is that it gives an unfair advantage to insiders, who got larger token allocations and are subject to vesting. Tokens of investors and early contributors are locked for one year, after which for the following second and third years, 4% of total tokens are unlocked each month.But say EigenLayer waited one year until the token became transferable. That means insiders can start to immediately sell their tokens as soon as it becomes tradable.EigenLayer addressed this by clarifying that the lockup countdown starts after transferability.They also provided a clearer timeline as to when the token will be transferable, saying the features they want to see enabled for transferability are targeted for the protocol’s mainnet launch in September this year.Points Changed AirdropsAfter analyzing each criticism, I understand why people were upset with the geo-block and lack of transferability, but I don’t think it’s fair to say the team was “greedy and didn’t distribute enough tokens,” as their token allocation is in line with what’s been the norm.But what’s clear is that the introduction of points has materially changed the game for airdrops. They introduced higher expectations from token distributions, and in my opinion, rightfully so. Traders and projects are effectively entering a social contract where traders put their capital at risk to perform actions projects are incentivizing with points.Why put money at risk in exchange for points? Because there is the expectation that those points will become money (via tokens) down the line. The expectation is there because that is effectively what has been playing out in DeFi, with multiple projects’ points systems effectively leading to airdrops, and entire multi-billion dollar protocols built around the concept. By awarding points, you are entering into this game and it’s disingenuous to pretend otherwise.

Has Bitcoin Price Peaked? Fundstrat Founder Tom Lee Clarifies - Bitcoin Sistemi


Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee believes that the Bitcoin price has not peaked yet.
In the latest episode of the “Speak Up” program with famous American investor Anthony Scaramucci, Lee expressed his belief that the current market situation is not a peak indicator for BTC.


“That doesn't mean it's going to reverse today, but I don't think it's a peak,” Lee said. Seeing the recent decline in Bitcoin's price as a bear trap, Lee claims that it could potentially be a good buying opportunity. “I think the April turmoil is kind of fooling us,” he added.
Lee also highlighted Bitcoin's technological breakthrough, describing it as “the purest form of trust.” He argued that Bitcoin's high level of security gives it a significant benefit.






Bitcoin has a proven track record as an asset that has been around for 15 years. Lee posed the question: “How many trillion-dollar markets have existed for 15 years and then disappeared? Never in history.”
Lee is confident that Bitcoin's price will not drop to zero due to the size of the market. He describes such a scenario as “unprecedented”:


“There have been many attempts to eliminate Bitcoin, but ultimately financial institutions are slowly starting to realize that it is actually a great solution. That's why BlackRock and others are supporting this through spot Bitcoin ETFs.”

increased demand for trading of Hong Kong's Virtual Asset ETFs soars

Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) connected to virtual assets saw a spike in trading volumes in Hong Kong. The granting of the license from the Hong Kong SFC has brought about some hope. Nonetheless, a host of other difficulties stand in the way.Strong initial trading volumes reflect Hong Kong’s investor enthusiasmETF trading volumes featuring virtual assets in Hong Kong displayed the commencement in a sound way as the overall trading volume increased to HK$48.91 million. During the day, Bitcoin ETF continued to be the ruler with the sum amount of HK$43.41 million, while Ethereum ETF conquered second place with HK$5.5 million. However, this increased volume of trading highlights greater interest in the virtual gold rush within the Hong Kong market.Despite the cautious approach, experts acknowledge that the ongoing regulatory and market challenges still remain which may hinder the technological progress since the digital transformation of the financial sector has had a significant impact on several aspects of our lives.While the green-light of virtual asset ETFs was well received the remain worry is  about the prospects of such products. In a way, crypto-ETFs can be seen as a huge step forward, but for longer-term investors, they might still be a bit skeptical. Eric Balchunas, who is the Senior ETF Analyst of Bloomberg, suggests  that there will moderate inflows of around $500 million into this market, which reflects the trouble that Hong Kong is having to reach the size of its American competitors.Market size and governmental regulation as a resistanceAnalysts provide various justifications for placing conservative estimates. Against the backdrop of the US market of $15 trillion, Hong Kong ETF, at $50 billion in value, is not that large. In addition, impediments of control imposed by the Chinese regulators on their local citizens in the stipulation for these ETFs demand limit their desires for purchase.prominent players such as BlackRock which are absent in the Hong Kong ETF market support the invests of larger sizes.there are plans that the infrastructure of the Hong Kong market is yet to be equitable and efficient similar to the substitute US market. Unrelated to this, we realize that this inefficiency causes premium discounts and wider spreads for exchange-traded funds which can possibly cause accomplished investors who are already accustomed to the convenience of the US market to lose interest.If another reason is to be added, the higher fees are also contributing to the low estimate for the ETF investment, but it may be between 1%~2%. If investors who are used to paying for low-cost securities in the US fees are options, this can be a turn-off. As per BalchunasImplications for the futurethe success of virtual asset ETFs in Hong Kong can only be assessed in the long run. The initial numbers of trading volumes may indicate their promising future for the region, however, the comparison with the scale and dominance of the US virtual asset ETFs may give a clearer perspective of whether Hong Kong can match up to their American counterparts. The initial fruitful stream submission is a tell-tale sign of the rising eagerness for virtual assets investment in the area.Hong Kong’s crypto ETFs immediately receive robust trading volumes upon their launch underlines the challenge ahead of the industry as it strives to solidify itself as a highly competitive player in a crowded international space.

This significant move reflects Yong Rong’s confidence in the potential of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, as a store of value and investment opportunity.
Yong Rong’s potential impact on IBIT outflows
In an intriguing analysis by James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, concerns were raised regarding the potential impact of Yong Rong Asset Management’s investment strategy on IBIT. Seyffart suggested that a significant selloff by Yong Rong could trigger major outflows from IBIT, potentially affecting market dynamics.
Furthermore, speculations were made about the possibility of Yong Rong migrating its investments from IBIT to a Hong Kong-based spot Bitcoin ETF, although potential gains taxes could present a hurdle to such a move.

Ovata’s strategic investments underscore the growing interest and demand for Bitcoin-related investment products in the global market.
BTC price recovers after testing multi-month lows
After recent fluctuations in the market, the price of Bitcoin has managed to recover, surpassing the $62,000 mark. At press time, BTC was trading at $62,042.15.
This price surge comes amidst cooling labour market conditions and an unexpected increase in unemployment rates to 3.9%, higher than the anticipated 3.8%.
Analysts speculate that the Federal Reserve may implement further rate cuts this year, as indicated by FED Swaps signalling two rate cuts of 25 bps each.
These market dynamics highlight the resilience of Bitcoin and its potential to serve as a hedge against economic uncertainties.

Poisoned Wallet Address Loses $70 Million in ‘Very Suspicious’ WBTC Transaction - The Defiant

A fake transaction led a user to send 1,155 WBTC to the wrong address.An unsuspecting user lost $69 million in WBTC today after sending the funds to an address linked with an attack known as address poisoning.Web3 cybersecurity firm Certik first alerted of the malicious transaction early Friday morning. The attacker mimicked a transfer of 0.05 ETH, or $150, which led the victim to send the funds to the wrong address, according to Certik’s X account.Poisoning addresses refers to attackers sending spam transactions to an address in order to confuse inattentive users. Users then copy the fraudulent address–which usually begins and ends with the same six digits– instead of sending funds to a legitimate wallet address.Hackers can know an address linked to a user’s exchange account because of recurring payments and other transaction flows.Low Success RateThe pseudonymous Officer, a threat researcher formerly of the Web3 cybersecurity firm ImmuneFi, told The Defiant that these types of attacks are very common but usually have a low success rate.According to Etherscan, after the attack, the perpetrator moved the funds in eight separate transactions.According to Officer, many users are lazy when operating in the crypto space.“A lot of people have a bad habit of blind copying the last address from their transaction history, just to be sure,” he said. Hackers take advantage of this behavior by sending small sums of crypto from similar-looking addresses.Triple CheckHow to counter such attacks?“Don't trust Clipboard especially given the fact that malware with almost the same scheme exists (it usually targets a clipboard), check all digits one by one and add hot addresses to the allow list (if possible),” he warned.Exploits have been on a negative curve during 2024.Hackers stole $336 million in crypto in the first quarter this year, a 23% drop from the same time last year, according to the latest report by Web3 security firm ImmuneFi.

The amount is 8% smaller than the total invested in March, which had the largest monthly fundraising since October 2022.Investments in crypto startups focused on building blockchain infrastructure surpassed $730 million, representing 78% of all the amount raised last month. This is even more than the $655 million seen in March, the month with the largest infrastructure allocations in the first quarter.Layer-1 blockchain Monad registered the largest fundraising round in the period, with $225 million received from players such as Paradigm, Electric Capital, and Coinbase Ventures.Berachain is another layer-1 blockchain that received a significant amount of funding in April, totaling $100 million invested by Framework Ventures, Samsung Next, Arrington Capital, and many others.Moreover, a $90 million private sale of OP tokens from Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Optimism to a16z on April 30 adds to the infrastructure investments.The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector also received more funding from VCs in April, with $157 million captured last month surpassing March by $50 million. Ellipsis Labs received $20 million in a round led by Paradigm to build an on-chain liquidity primitive on Solana’s blockchain.Another sector in crypto that received more attention from VCs in April is the Web3-focused applications sector, jumping from gathering $3 million in March to $19 million in April. The startup Legitimate led the investments with $4.3 million received last month to build its product aimed at bridging the physical and digital worlds.Web3 gaming was the only sector in the blockchain industry that registered a smaller capital influx from VCs into its projects, sliding from $83 million to $24.7 million in April. Crypto gaming studio Avalon received $10 million from VCs, almost half of all the funding directed at this sector last month.

CFTC Commissioner Johnson Proposes AI Recommendations, Looping in DeFi - Benzinga

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Kristin Johnson proposed recommendations such as heightened penalties to address artificial intelligence in financial markets, including decentralized finance. In a speech delivered at the Sidley Austin and Rutgers Law School Fintech and Blockchain Symposium, Commissioner Johnson outlined her concerns about AI and how that applies to DeFi. "Deploying AI in ecosystems running on blockchain technology raises novel issues for supervision, risk management, and compliance, as well as enforcement" Johnson said on Friday. AI has been integrated into financial markets, including brokerage apps, compliance programs and robo-advisers. In DeFi, AI can be used in automated trading and algorithmic trading. AI in general has raised concerns among regulators over risks such as manipulation and fraud, bias and customer protection. Read the full story at The Block.Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Victim Loses Over $71 Million Worth of WBTC in Purported 'Address Poisoning' Attack - Benzinga

Someone lost over $71 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin WBTC/USD in what appears to be an address poisoning attack. The victim transferred 1,155 WBTC ($71.1 million) to the alleged attacker, according to on-chain transfers from the Etherscan blockchain explorer.  A poisoning attack when the hacker conjures a wallet address similar to the victim's, either through vanity address services or through address mining, and spams the victim with numerous transactions. If the victim accidentally copies the hacker's fake address, they'll have transferred their funds to the hacker instead of to their own. Read the full story at The Block.Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Dogecoin Rival Shiba Inu (SHIB) Completes Highly Anticipated Shibarium Hard Fork - The Daily Hodl


								Dogecoin (DOGE) competitor Shiba Inu (SHIB) is announcing the completion of its highly anticipated Shibarium hard fork.
In a new thread on the social media platform X, the team behind the dog-themed meme asset says they have officially completed the Shibarium hard fork, a move traders have been expecting since last year.










“Shibarium has successfully completed its hard fork at block height 4504576! Get ready for: blazing-fast transactions and predictable gas fees!”
Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution, initially released a beta bridge for public use in July 2023. It utilized both plasma and proof-of-stake (PoS) technology to allow investors to shift tokens between Shibarium and the leading smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH).
In June 2023, Lucie, a content market specialist for Shiba Inu, detailed the benefits of Shibarium, including lower gas fees, faster transactions, more use cases for the Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) digital asset, as well as enhanced security features.
 “Shibarium empowers projects by offering scalability, cost-effectiveness, and enhanced security. The reduced gas fees on Shibarium can have a significant impact on Bone, increasing its demand and potential value.
With Shibarium, projects have the opportunity to innovate, expand, and create a more accessible and thriving decentralized ecosystem.” 
In September 2023, it was reported that Shibarium was growing rapidly, surpassing 2.5 million transactions overall, reaching 200,000 daily transactions on average. Furthermore, it was revealed that the protocol had over 1.2 million unique wallet addresses using its service while the amount of BONE reached 27.1 million.
SHIB is trading for $0.000024 at time of writing, a 5.2% increase during the last 24 hours.

Crypto Downturn a Buying Opportunity: BitMEX Founder Says ‘Buy in May, Go Away’ | Cryptoglobe


                                
Arthur Hayes, the founder of popular cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform BitMEX, has recently shared his analysis of the recent turmoil in the cryptocurrency markets. He predicts a local bottom has been hit and suggests upcoming rangebound action.



In a post titled “Mayday” on the BitMEX blog, Hayes attributed the volatility seen in the cryptocurrency space to a confluence of factors that included the conclusion of the U.S. tax season, anxieties surrounding potential Federal Reserve policy changes, Bitcoin’s recent halving event, and stagnant growth in assets under management for spot U.S. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



Hayes revealed he views the recent downturn as a necessary correction for speculative excesses and suggested that “tourists” will likely sit out the upcoming recovery, while experienced investors will HODL and potentially accumulate more established assets like Bitcoin and Ether, and potentially take advantage of “high-beta” (more volatile) cryptocurrencies like Dog Wif Hat and other memecoins.



A central theme in Hayes’ analysis is the Federal Reserve’s recent adjustments to its quantitative tightening (QT) program. Initially aiming to reduce bond purchases by $95 billion per month, the Fed has scaled this back to $60 billion, something Hayes interprets as a disguised form of quantitative easing, injecting an additional $35 billion per month back into the dollar liquidity pool.



He argues that when combined with other measures, this reduction in QT effectively increases the stimulus provided to global financial markets. Hayes also examined recent actions by the U.S. Treasury Department, led by Secretary Janet Yellen and dissected the Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA) which forecasts borrowing and cash balances for upcoming quarters.



The QRA for the second quarter of the year projects borrowing $243 billion, $41 billion above prior estimates due to lower-than-expected tax revenue. Hayes suggests this increased Treasury issuance could lead to higher long-term interest rates and speculated that Yellen might counter this with yield curve control measures, a scenario that could potentially trigger a significant rally in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.



The recent collapse of Republic First Bank also entered into Hayes’ analysis, as he criticized the swift response by monetary authorities, which ensured all depositors were compensated.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

While this may appear reassuring, Hayes argued it masks underlying vulnerabilities within the U.S. banking system and added that this “safety net” effectively guarantees even uninsured deposits, leading to a form of hidden money printing by the government which could fuel further inflationary pressures. He wrote:



Like the other stealth money printing policies discussed in this essay, there is no massive liquidity injection today. However, we now know with full confidence that trillions of contingent liabilities have been added to the Fed’s balance sheet, which will be funded with printed money.



Unfazed by the recent market turbulence, Hayes advocates for active investment, creating a section titled “buy in May, go away” in a play on the popular financial saying “sell in May and go away” that is based on stocks’ historical underperformance between May and October.



Hayes recommended investors reender the market as the “slow addition of billions of dollars of liquidity each month will dampen negative price movement from here on out,” and while he doesn’t expected “ crypto to fully realize the recent US monetary announcements’ inflationary nature immediately, I expect prices to bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher. “



Per his words the “recent intense puke” provides him an opportunity to buy Solana and “doggie coins for momentum trading position,” while longer-term position will see him “identify other tokens” he believes are undervalued.



He noted that after accumulating this month he will “ set it, forget it, and wait for the market to appreciate the inflationary nature of the recent US monetary policy announcements.”



In his footnotes, he suggested he believes Bitcoin hit a local low earlier this week below the $58,000 mark and believes it will now rally to surpass $60,000 and enter a range-bound period between $60,000 and $70,000 until August.

OKX Latest To Fold in Nigeria's War on Crypto, Pulls Naira P2P - DailyCoin


        
OKX has removed naira support from its p2p platform.



The crypto exchange’s move comes after Nigerian authorities forced Binance to do so over a month ago.



Local reports indicate that a blanket ban on crypto p2p trading may be in the works.
Nigerian crypto users are quickly running out of options.As part of efforts to stem the free fall of the naira, the country’s local currency, authorities have turned their attention to the crypto sector, alleging that peer-to-peer (p2p) traders are manipulating the naira through pump-and-dump strategies. In line with this reasoning, the country’s central bank has launched a wide-reaching campaign against the crypto industry that, till now, has seen most of the focus on Binance, forcing the firm to shut down its naira p2p platform and charging it for money laundering and tax evasion.However, as authorities have repeatedly made clear, Binance is not the only firm in its crosshairs. Following Binance, OKX has now also seized naira p2p support.Changing Market RequirementsAs of Friday, May 3, the Nigerian naira could no longer be found on OKX’s p2p marketplace. 
OKX confirmed the removal of the currency from the platform in an X post from its official help desk account, citing “a change in local market requirements.”“We understand that this change might have an impact on your trading preferences, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause,” the team added.
Most Nigerian crypto users have been left wondering which exchange would be the next domino to fall while decrying the potential effects on young people who have built businesses and streams of income around the sector.The recent OKX move comes as rumors of a looming crypto p2p ban gain momentum.Back to Square One?On Friday, May 3, a local news outlet reported that at least three fintech startups in the country, including Moniepoint, Paga, and Palmpay, will block the accounts of users engaging in crypto p2p trading and report suspected transactions to authorities in line with the National Security Adviser (NSA) designating crypto trading as a national security issue.According to two persons familiar with the matter that the outlet cited, regulations to impose a ban on crypto p2p trading will soon be unveiled. If it happens, the ban would effectively be a U-turn on the Central Bank’s December 2023 decision to lift a two-year ban on banks facilitating crypto transactions.Meanwhile, this week, authorities have already frozen the accounts of over 1,000 crypto traders in the country amid ongoing investigations into money laundering and terrorism financing.On the Flipside 
Nigerian OKX users can still access other services on the platform and transfer their assets to other platforms if desired.



A recent circular dubbed as fake by Nigeria’s central bank had instructed banks to freeze the accounts of cryptocurrency traders, stoking crypto ban fears.
Why This MattersOKX’s move to cease naira support on its p2p platform suggests Nigeria’s crackdown on crypto is intensifying, foreboding a potential blanket ban on crypto p2p transactions. This move could force crypto p2p transactions to move to encrypted messaging platforms lacking the escrow services offered by exchanges, exposing users to greater risks of scams.Read this for more on Nigeria’s war on crypto:Unraveling Binance’s Nigeria Woes as Govt Hunts User InfoLearn more about a recent move from a hitherto dormant Ethereum whale:$5.5M Move Shakes Ethereum as Genesis-Era Wallet Awakens

Bitcoin Analyst Says Rally To Over $90,000 Programmed As Money Supply Grows


								Bitcoin price action might be dicey, undergoing a major corrective phase. However, even as $60,000 looks slippery for upbeat bulls, some analysts are optimistic that the coin is ready for a strong leg up. 
Going by past price action, analysts maintain that the coin will surge above $73,800 and register fresh all-time highs closer to or higher than $100,000 in this projected expansion.
Historical Price Action Places BTC Above $90,000 In Coming Months
One analyst, posting on platform X, offered a bold prediction based on price action from late 2022. Then, Bitcoin spectacularly collapsed to as low as $15,500 before bouncing back sharply throughout 2023 and Q1 2024. 
Bitcoin may surge to at least $90,000 | Source: Analyst on X
Therefore, if Bitcoin follows this formation, the coin will soar to $90,000 and even reach $100,000. While the timeframe for this potential surge remains unclear, another analyst on platform Y chimed in with a specific prediction.

In a post on X, the analyst said it is imperative that Bitcoin trades above $60,000 so that the uptrend momentum doesn’t fizzle. This resilience will form the base of a leg up that will see Bitcoin roar to as high as $95,000 by August 2024. The timing of this potential peak is because, the analyst explains, price action is fractal and thus tends to rhyme.
Bitcoin price trending upwards on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView
Further bolstering this bullish outlook, another analyst noted that after prices sunk to as low as $56,500 this week, it retested a key support trend line. 
Since this trend line is held, the analyst predicts that “it is only a matter of time” before prices shoot higher. However, prices will flip green if there is a close above the current all-time high of $73,800.
Inflation Remains High And M2 Supply In The United States Growing
With the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Bitcoin is now interwoven with global markets. Accordingly, key events in traditional finance will likely impact crypto prices and sentiment. One key metric that investors and analysts have been monitoring is inflation. 
Related Reading: FTX Exec Loses Paradise, Surrenders $5.9 Million Bahamas Mansion
Inflation has been higher than the benchmark 2% in the United States, an obstacle preventing the Federal Reserve from slashing rates further. 

However, even as inflation drops—from the 2021 to 2024 cycle—the M2 money supply has been rising, according to FRED Economic data. The last time it grew, it triggered a bull run that forced the coin to fresh all-time highs of around $70,000.

Developers of Popular Altcoin Announce Two More Tokens - Also Launching Farming - Bitcoin Sistemi


MakerDAO, a leading platform in decentralized finance (DeFi), announced that it plans to introduce two new tokens to its ecosystem, NewStable (NST) and NewGovToken (NGT). The official names of these tokens will be announced at an upcoming brand launch.
NewStable was introduced as the codename for an upgraded version of Dai, MakerDAO's existing stablecoin. According to the official statement, this new token is designed for wider adoption and comes with improved stability features. According to the statement, there will be a possibility of constantly returning from this token to DAI, another stablecoin.




In addition, NST holders will have the opportunity to farm to earn NGT from launch. A total of NGT 600 million will be distributed annually to participating NST holders through farming.






According to the statement, NewGovToken represents a refined approach to governance in the MakerDAO ecosystem. It is designed to encourage broader participation and more dynamic decision-making processes. Each Maker (MKR) token can be converted into 24,000 NGT.
The total supply of NewGovToken has been strategically renominated compared to MKR. Therefore, during the upgrade, each MKR will convert into 24,000 NewGovTokens. This revaluation of NewGovToken will result in more users owning a significant number of NewGovTokens.


According to the official statement, these innovations represent an expansion and will not replace the existing Dai (DAI) and Maker (MKR) tokens.

Solana Enters Buy Territory On Major Crypto Market Rebound - DailyCoin


        
Solana has experienced a significant rally.



Technical indicators move decisively in the buy territory. 



The overall crypto market trends have been positive.
After a brief decline, Solana has entered what appears to be a bullish phase once again, as a part of a broader positive movement in the crypto markets. The bullish momentum comes amid a positive macroeconomic shift and corporate adoption. What’s Behind the Crypto Market SurgeOn Friday, May 3, Solana’s rose to $142, up 3% from the previous day. Its performance followed a larger trend in the crypto market, as the crypto market cap in the same period increased by 3.75% within 24 hours, reaching $2.29 trillion. This surge was influenced by several major developments, including macroeconomic factors and adoption.  Firstly, the Federal Reserve has signaled a shift towards a less hawkish monetary policy, maintaining the interest rates unchanged at 5.25% to 5.50% while indicating the potential for three rate cuts in the coming year. This shift is good for riskier assets like crypto, as investors divest from low-yielding bonds​. 
Adding to the sentiment, PayPal announced a partnership with cryptocurrency firm MoonPay, opening its ecosystem to crypto trading. The move opens up crypto to PayPal’s 426 million customers worldwide. In light of this, Solana’s technical indicators have shown a significant bullish reversal. What Solana’s Technicals SaySolana’s recent increase to $142.09 is supported by several short-term buying signals from its moving averages. The 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Simple Moving Average (SMA) stand at 139.63 and 138.94, respectively, both indicating a buy. However, medium-term indicators signal caution. Specifically, the 20-day EMA and SMA, at 144.90 and 142.20, respectively, and the 30-day EMA and SMA, at 148.94 and 151.71, all hint at sell signals. These suggest that Solana might face resistance near these higher average values.
Oscillators, which help identify market momentum and potential reversal points, also show a mixed sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), sitting at 45.93, shows a neutral position, not in overbought or oversold territory. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), with a value of -7.02, indicates a buy signal. This suggests increasing bullish momentum, which if sustained, could push Solana’s price further up. Other oscillators like the Stochastic RSI and the Commodity Channel Index are also in neutral zones. Given the latest surge, Solana demonstrates robust short-term growth, supported by favorable technical indicators. However, the mixed signals from medium-term moving averages and oscillators suggest a potential reversal in the future.On the Flipside
Solana has been experiencing ongoing congestion issues, leading to a significant increase in transaction failures. However, these issues have not deterred Solana investors. 



Technical analysis indicates the current market sentiment, rather than a prediction of future price movements. 
Why This MattersThe recent rise in Solana’s price, with the broader crypto market, is significant because it reflects increased investor confidence and market acceptance. Such movements suggest that cryptocurrencies are becoming more integrated into the mainstream financial ecosystem.Read more about the recent Solana price movement. Solana Sees Momentum Dwindle as Updates Fail to Fix CongestionRead more about the ZKasino rug pull: ZKasino $32M Scam Suspect Arrested: Here’s What We Know

XRP Forms On-Chain Signal That Led To 16% Crash Last Time


                            On-chain data shows that many old coins have moved on the XRP network recently, a sign that proved to be bearish for the coin last time.
XRP Age Consumed Metric Has Registered A Large Spike
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, XRP has just observed a large movement of dormant coins similar to what the asset witnessed last month.
The indicator of interest here is the “Age Consumed,” which shows “the amount of tokens changing addresses on a certain date, multiplied by the time since they last moved,” as per Santiment’s definition.

When this metric has a high value, it means that a large number of coins previously dormant have finally been moved to the blockchain. Old coins are generally less likely to become involved in selling, as they belong to the more resolute hands in the market. As such, any large movements of these coins can be worth noting since it’s not an event that happens too often.
The below chart shows the trend in this indicator for XRP over the past month or so:

The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on X
From the graph, it’s visible that the XRP Age Consumed registered a sharp spike at the start of this month, implying that some old hands have decided to break their silence.
This latest spike has been quite massive in scale and has been reminiscent of another spike that was seen last month. Interestingly, this previous spike occurred shortly before the price of the cryptocurrency tanked 16%.
Thus, the previous spike would have corresponded to some HODLers moving to sell their coins. It’s possible that the latest large dormant coin movement was also made for a similar purpose, and hence, it can prove to be bearish for XRP.
Santiment points out that this may not be so after all, though, saying:
There is an argument that this old coin movement is related to potential #buythedip interest from key stakeholders, and prices have been climbing mildly since this May spike occurred.
While this dormant coin movement may turn out to be bullish this time around, there is another signal brewing for the asset that can also be something to keep an eye on.
As highlighted in the same chart, the Total Open Interest for XRP, which keeps track of the number of derivative positions currently open on all exchanges related to the asset, has been going up recently.
This metric is now at a 3-week high of $483.4 million, implying that there is a notable amount of speculation in the market right now. Historically, this has led to volatility in the price.

In theory, this volatility can take the asset in either direction, but it’s worth noting that the crash last month occurred after the Open Interest hit extreme levels. So far, though, the indicator hasn’t quite yet reached the same highs.
XRP Price
XRP is yet to make any significant recovery from the crash last month as its price is still trading around $0.52.

Dogecoin Open Interest Crashes 66.5% In One Month, What Does This Mean For Price? | Bitcoinist.com


								The Dogecoin open interest has seen a massive crash in the last month, leading to concerns about the future prospects of the meme coin. It is now a long way from its March all-time highs and has returned to the low levels of early February.
Dogecoin Open Interest Sees 66.5% Crash
In March, the Dogecoin open interest had risen to a new all-time high of $1.91 billion after a month of steady increase. This was followed by an increase in the DOGE price as investors rushed to join the rally and secure gains. This steady growth would continue into the start of April, but since then, the price has been on a downtrend.

Data from Coinglass shows that on April 1, the total Dogecoin open interest came out to $1.87 billion. But in the space of one week, the open interest had fallen by $600 million. The decline continued through to the end of April and by the end of the month, the open interest was at $763 million.

Source: Coinglass
With the month of May following the bearish trend of April, the decline in the open interest has been constant. At the time of writing, the total Dogecoin open interest is sitting at $625.7 million, a whopping 66.5% crash from its $1.87 billion level just a month ago.
The last time the Dogecoin open interest was this low was toward the end of February. However, the open interest is still a long way from its January lows when it was trending below $300 million. At the same time, the DOGE price is also higher, suggesting the last few months have been quite good for the meme coin.
How Will DOGE Price React?
The reaction to a sharp drop in open interest has always been the same, ending with the price of the cryptocurrency seeing a decline. Dogecoin has stuck to this trend as its price has dumped almost 50% at the same time as bears continue to exert dominance.

If the DOGE open interest continues to decline, then investors can expect the price to follow the same path. Such a crash could send the Dogecoin price below the $0.12 support, which could be the start of a downward spiral.
However, if the open interest does recover, then a reversal in price is expected as well. Mostly, this would depend on how the price of Bitcoin performs from now on, but as interest begins to grow and traders take more positions, it gives room for Dogecoin to grow.

FLOKI's trend reversal depends on THIS key factor panning out - AMBCrypto



Positive sentiment and interactions around Floki Inu grew significantly over the last few days
Despite the surge in price, however, holders remained unprofitable

Once upon a time, Floki Inu [FLOKI] was left behind as other memecoins entered the market and flooded social media platforms with hype. However, recent data suggests that this could finally be changing.
A rise in popularity
According to LunarCrush’s data, FLOKI has dominated the field in terms of social activity. Apart from Solana, the memecoin has outperformed all other coins in this space. Over the last 24 hours, the positive sentiment around the altcoin grew by 89%. Additionally, the number of interactions FLOKI was having across social media platforms also surged.
Because Floki is a memecoin, the success of the token depends on its popularity on social media.
Source: X
Looking at the price
Due to the surge in activity on social media platforms, the price of FLOKI surged materially. In the last 24 hours alone, the price of FLOKI hiked by 6.19%. However, this surge in price did not translate to a bullish trend. In fact, since 28 March, the price of FLOKI has fallen on the charts. After the decline in price, FLOKI continued to hit lower lows and lower highs – Indicative of a bearish trend.
For FLOKI to reverse the trend and rally again, its price would have to break past the $0.00020873-level in the future. It would need massive bullish momentum to do the same. While the RSI (Relative Strength Index) for FLOKI hiked to 51.4, the uptick wasn’t significant enough for a big move.
Moreover, the CMF(Chaikin Money Flow) for the token also declined, pointing to heightened selling pressure on FLOKI’s markets. It remains to be seen whether the price of FLOKI succumbs to the selling pressure or not.
Source: Trading View
How are holders doing?
A massive factor that contributes to selling pressure of a token is the profitability of addresses. If holders become profitable in a very short span of time, they are much likely to sell their holdings. This was not the case with FLOKI.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the MVRV ratio of FLOKI declined, indicating that most holders are yet to see profits. This means that the price of FLOKI could surge further before holders indulge in profit taking, while subsequently causing a correction.

Realistic or not, here’s FLOKI market cap in BTC‘s terms

Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Snaps Losing Streak, Pulls In $63 Million - Decrypt

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF finally drew more new cash than it lost, snapping an 11-week streak with a positive gain of $63 million, according to CoinGlass.GBTC has been seen so many investors cashing out since competing spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January, its outflows alone often weighed down the entire nascent space.“Holy crap $GBTC had inflows today,” tweeted Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. “Their 80 day-ish streak is finally over. I had to run my eyes and double check the data but it’s true."He added: “On a scale of 1-10 how ‘we’re so back’ is this?”GBTC is still the largest Bitcoin spot ETF, with over $18.7 billion assets under management (AUM), coupled to about 297,000 Bitcoin. But constant outflows allowed newer competitors to close the gap, and the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has $17.2 billion AUM as of Tuesday.The good news for Grayscale comes soon after spot Bitcoin ETFs logged their worst day on record, when half a billion dollars in net outflows coincided with a drop in the price of BTC on Wednesday.Bitcoin ETFs saw mid-week outflows of $563 million, CoinGlass data showed, overshadowing the previous daily record $326 million set n in mid-March.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Coinbase's Base could make it the NVIDIA of DeFia

Coinbase’s first-quarter earnings report — released May 2 — indicated the company has been thriving thanks to a vibrant market for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) over the last several months. However, the numbers indicated Base platform has shown even greater potential — and could make Coinbase the NVIDIA of decentralized finance (DeFi).Launched in August 2023, Base is a secure, low-cost Ethereum layer-2 solution built to scale Coinbase’s user base on-chain to make transactions faster. Coinbase’s vision is to decentralize Base and create an open, global crypto ecosystem leveraging the security of the Ethereum mainnet, which is accessible to everyone. According to Coinbase’s Q1 report, volume on Base has surged past its competitors, particularly after the rollout of Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade. DeFi crypto exchanges on Base saw daily trading volume surpass $1 billion per day, narrowing the gap between Coinbase’s main centralized exchange trading volumes, where almost 250 cryptocurrencies are traded.Related: Crypto leaders should stop flirting with CBDCsThe Dencun upgrade significantly boosted activity on Base. Within a short span, Base experienced a surge in daily transaction volume and revenue, surpassing competitors like Optimism and Arbitrum. The upgrade reduced costs for layer-2 scaling chains such as Base and led to a surge in user engagement and transaction volume.New Base users have climbed by more than 8 million between July 2023 and May 2024. Source: DuneSince the upgrade, Base has consistently processed more than 3 million transactions daily, substantially lifting its fee revenue. If this pace is sustained, Base could become a big growth driver for Coinbase. Since the Dencun upgrade, the fees that Base has earned have surpassed the other major Ethereum scaling networks.The spike in Base’s revenue is attributed to its support for DeFi protocols, with roughly 250 protocols currently operating on the network. Its impressive rise in market share in such short period of time illustrates Base’s potential — and undergirds the case that Coinbase could become the NVIDIA of DeFi as a long-term industry leader. Outlook for Q2Now that Bitcoin's halving — one of its major price drivers — is over, the outlook for cryptos may turn back to macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation, the direction of stock markets and geopolitical tensions. The Federal Reserve’s “higher for longer” stance is one of the catalysts that could set a risk-off mood in the markets and exert downward pressure on riskier assets. Coinbase provided good guidance for the second quarter of 2024, but cautioned that results will depend on crypto prices. Since Bitcoin peaked in mid-March trading volumes have been declining, and the second quarter is likely to be weaker than the first, especially if crypto prices continue to slide. Over the long-term, Bitcoin’s bull run is likely to resume. Higher price levels are in the cards. But in the short-term, further weakness is likely to unfold.Coinbase custodian fee revenue is expected to riseCoinbase revenue from transactions is roughly half of net revenue. The other half comes from non-transactions revenue, which encompass subscriptions and services: stablecoin revenue, custodial fees, blockchain rewards, and interest income. The non-transactions revenue has seen a strong growth over the past two years and could offset fluctuations in transactions revenue, which is highly correlated to cryptocurrencies prices. Coinbase is the custodian for eight of the 11 new Bitcoin ETFs launched on Jan. 10. These ETFs have reached close to $60 billion in assets under management in the first quarter of 2024. Coinbase charges a fee for assets under custody, which are a few basis-points on the assets under custody. As the assets under management in these ETFs increase, Coinbase custodian fees would rise too. Coinbase custodian fee revenue was $19.7 million in Q4’23. After the launch of the Bitcoin ETFs in mid-January, Coinbase revenue from custody fees rose 90% to $32.3 million. Cryptocurrency custodians have a similar role to banks in traditional finance – to settle trades, manage regulatory reporting, keep, and manage clients’ assets. However, for crypto markets the process is more complex as it is more specific to digital assets. Also, the technology, security and storage requirements are different. Base could offset some future declines in trading volumesWhile Base is likely to become a contributor to Coinbase’s top line revenue, it is likely to take some time. The additional — possibly substantial — source of revenue could help Coinbase's share price loosen its correlation to cryptocurrency price in the future. Related: Jerome Powell’s pivot heralds a boring summer for BitcoinOverall, there is still huge potential for cryptos to grow thanks to the United States' 11 Bitcoin ETFs. Likewise, six Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs launched in Hong Kong in April, and the Australian Securities Exchange may also approve its first Bitcoin ETFs before 2025.These factors are likely to offer consistent support for crypto in the long run, which will be beneficial for Coinbase transaction and non-transaction revenue. While declining crypto prices are likely to weigh on Coinbase’s share price in the short-term, Coinbase’s diversification of revenue drivers is likely to lead to higher share prices in the long-term.Violeta Todorova is a guest columnist for Cointelegraph and a senior research analyst for Leverage Shares.

                        While many market segments panic-sold their Bitcoin (BTC) this week, the digital currency’s largest whales seem to have bought the dip with size.Whales Buy The Bitcoin Dip
According to data provided by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, active Bitcoin whale addresses accumulated 47,000 BTC within 24 hours following Bitcoin’s slide this week below $57,000 per coin.An active whale address is defined as owning at least 100 BTC, and having engaged in on-chain activity within the past day. Young Ju said the balances discount centralized exchanges and Bitcoin miners, but include certain Bitcoin custodians such as Bitcoin ETF providers.“We’re entering a new era,” Young Ju wrote to Twitter regarding the data. Though whale balances have significantly increased since Bitcoin spot ETFs were approved in the United States this year, the executive says this week’s balance spike was “not ETF related.”A day prior, Young Ju highlighted how new Bitcoin whales, including spot ETF buyers, went underwater on their investments after Bitcoin plunged under $60,800.Similarly, analysis from lead Glassnode analyst James Check found that Bitcoin’s broader short-term holder cost basis as of Wednesday was $59,600. Statistically, short-term holders are more likely to panic sell their holdings once their cost basis is lost, exacerbating price volatility at the time.Regardless, Check also said that the dip was of a standard size seen in typical Bitcoin bull markets, and predicted it would make a good time to buy. As of Friday, Bitcoin has surged back to $62,700, proving profitable for anyone who followed his advice.Interpreting The Data
According to analyst TXMCtrades, the increased whale address balance may actually not represent whales accumulating coins, but instead show “innocuous wallet management flow” among larger entities.“There are hundreds/thousands of unidentified on-chain entities with big footprints, but people who don’t look at this data all day will be encouraged to leap to wild conclusions,” he wrote to Twitter on Friday.Bitcoin ETF data shows that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) had net inflows on Friday for the first time since launching as a Bitcoin spot ETF, possibly signaling the first strong inflow day for Bitcoin ETFs at large in almost a month.

                        In a major step towards launching its native token, ZRO, cross-chain interoperability protocol LayerZero successfully completed its first airdrop snapshot on May 1. The snapshot marks a crucial stage in the protocol’s development and has generated considerable excitement within the DeFi community.LayerZero Labs confirmed the completion of the airdrop snapshot via an X post on May 2. The snapshot will determine the allocation of ZRO tokens to eligible participants upon the official launch, expected to occur in the first half of 2024.“LayerZero will have a native token within the protocol, and its distribution is expected to happen in the first half of 2024,” the announcement read.Anticipation for the ZRO token launch is already evident, particularly on decentralized exchanges. On Hyperliquid, the world’s largest perps DEX, a perpetual futures contract for ZRO, is currently trading at $8.4. This suggests a fully diluted valuation of approximately $17 billion for the forthcoming token.Potential Implications of the LayerZero AirdropWhile the LayerZero airdrop presents an exciting opportunity for the protocol and its community, it raises concerns about the potential impact of Sybil users. These individuals claim airdrops with multiple cryptocurrency wallets solely to sell the rewards without any intention of long-term engagement with the protocol. This practice can lead to a sharp decline in the price of the newly airdropped token following its launch.Several past airdrops have been affected by airdrop hunters. In February, it was revealed that the eligibility list for Starknet’s airdrop was predominantly composed of Sybil users, with 701,544 addresses out of 1.3 million linked to their activity. Similarly, in March 2023, 1,496 wallets belonging to airdrop hunters accumulated over $3.3 million worth of tokens from the Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop, contributing to a subsequent price decline.

Traders turn to tools such as DEXScreener as they hunt for top crypto gainers today in the on-chain markets / Source: Cryptonews
                        With blue-chip cryptocurrency markets recovering on Friday as macro traders price back in multiple rate cuts for 2024 following the latest US jobs report, traders looking for top crypto gainers today continue to turn to the highly illiquid and volatile on-chain markets for opportunities.On-chain markets refer to the market for crypto tokens and assets issued directly on the blockchain.For example, Shiba Inu (SHIB), crypto’s second-largest meme coin, was issued as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum.It can be traded off-chain on centralized exchanges, but the “real” SHIB trade all occurs on Ethereum.Wallets can send these tokens between themselves, or SHIB can be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEX).There is virtually no barrier to anyone launching their own token on a blockchain like Ethereum.That’s why new meme coins and shitcoins are popping up all the time. New coins often post fast exponential gains – this is why traders flock to the on-chain market. To try to hit the jackpot.But in these highly illiquid markets, a token can lose virtually all of its value in next to no time.And that’s not the only risk. Most newly launched tokens are either scams or pump and dump schemes and have no long-term value.Traders must always do their due diligence before investing. And traders must never risk more than they can afford to lose.That being said, here are some top crypto gainers today on Ethereum, according to DEX analytics tool DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayArky (ARKY)A new dog meme coin called Arky (ARKY), which claims to be named after the Bitcoin founder’s dog, is pumping.Last up 15,300% as per DEXScreener, it’s one of the top crypto gainers today.https://twitter.com/Arky_Coin/status/1786257974639661389The token last had a market cap of around $630,000 with around $100,000 in locked liquidity.The token has two issues with its smart contract, so traders should be careful. That being said, the community appears to like this coin.ARKY has 82 rock emoji votes on DEXScreener versus only 3 shitcoin votes and 7 red flag votes.PEEPO (PEEPO)A shitcoin called PEEPO (PEEPO) that has been around for over a year has suddenly sprung into life.As per DEXScreener, it just hit new yearly highs after pumping 320%.The token’s market cap was last around $5.6 million,  with around $930,000 in locked liquidity.Having been around over a year, PEEPO probably isn’t a scam at this point. More of just a failed meme coin trying to make a comeback.Three Protocol Token (THREE)Three Protocol Token (THREE) is pumping on Friday, having gained 100% in 24 hours as per DEXScreener.The decentralized marketplace-focused protocol’s token was last at a market cap of around $28 million.The token has amassed an impressive $800,000 in locked liquidity and only has one smart contract issue.Alternative Investment Strategy to Consider – Presales

Brian Armstrong Calls Coinbase's Base Top Layer 2 Solution


Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has stated that Base now leads as the top Layer-2 solution by transaction volume. 
Base harnesses “optimistic rollups” to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs by batching transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain. These transactions are later consolidated and finalized on the Ethereum mainnet, maintaining the high-security standards for which Ethereum is known. This efficient process significantly lowers costs.
 Top Layer 2 Solution With the Highest Transaction Volume
Armstrong detailed the innovations driving this shift during the first-quarter earnings call on May 2, 2024. The significant transaction volume on the network represents a significant leap in blockchain capability. 
According to Armstrong, it reflects Coinbase’s commitment to making crypto transactions as efficient and cost-effective as possible.

“Base has helped dramatically reduce transaction fees and confirmation times, getting us closer to our goal of having the average crypto transaction take less than one second and cost less than $0.01 anywhere in the world. Developer activity on it increased eightfold in Q1. In the last 30 days, Base has processed over two times as many transactions as the entire Ethereum network on Layer 1. Base is now the No. 1 Layer 2 solution by number of transactions processed, a huge accomplishment,” Armstrong said.

While numerous DeFi initiatives have launched on Base, the native projects on this platform have captured a substantial market share. 

For instance, Aerodrome, the top decentralized exchange (DEX) in its ecosystem regarding total value locked (TVL), has recently matched Uniswap in fee generation. This is particularly significant given that Uniswap operates across 16 different chains.
Moreover, Friend.Tech, a decentralized social media platform on Base, airdropped its native token, FRIEND, on Friday in conjunction with V2. The launch and airdrop are speculated to boost the Base ecosystem’s presence significantly.

The advancements in Base have led to an approximate 80% reduction in transaction fees, thanks to various protocol upgrades. Alongside these cost reductions, Armstrong announced the integration of the US Dollar Coin (USDC) across all Coinbase products.

Solana (SOL) Is Battling for Comeback, Bitcoin Is Ready for $60,000 Again, Dogecoin (DOGE) Profitable for 80% of Holders

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



Solana has been displaying a spirited attempt to reclaim its previous highs after a challenging period. The asset recently approached the $140 price level, and technical indicators suggest that a reversal may be on the horizon.Currently, Solana is testing the 100-day EMA, which coincides closely with the $140 level. This is a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency, as the 100 EMA often acts as a significant barometer for bullish or bearish trends. The increasing trading volume accompanying this price action adds a surprising twist to the narrative. Typically, a rise in volume alongside a test of key moving averages indicates strong potential for a breakout.Solana/USDT Chart by TradingViewIf Solana successfully breaches the 100 EMA, the next significant resistance lies around the $150 price point. Overcoming this barrier could confirm the start of a more sustained rally. The increase in volume supports the hypothesis of a breakout, hinting at growing investor interest and potential accumulation at these levels.On the support side, Solana finds a robust base around $115, as indicated by previous price reactions in this region. A strong bounce from this support could further solidify the base for its upward trajectory. However, if this level fails to hold, Solana might face downward pressure, testing lower support levels, possibly around the $100 mark.A successful climb above the 100 EMA could pave the way for a rally toward $150 and potentially higher, marking a significant recovery phase for Solana.  Bitcoin hits crucial levelBitcoin is once again nearing the critical threshold of $60,000, showcasing its potential for another significant rally. Currently, the cryptocurrency is hovering around the 100-day EMA, positioned at approximately $59,000.  Despite the proximity to this key level, the current market tempo indicates a cautious approach among investors. The trading volume and price movements suggest a slower climb than anticipated, which could impact Bitcoin's ability to smoothly surpass the $60,000 mark. The immediate resistance after $60,000 is observed around the $63,500 mark, which Bitcoin approached but did not conclusively breach in recent trading sessions. If Bitcoin manages to sustain momentum and break through the $60,000 resistance, this would likely set the stage for a test of higher resistances near $66,000.On the downside, support levels are distinctly visible. The most immediate robust support lies at $52,100, a level that has historically held up well against bearish downturns. Should Bitcoin experience a pullback, maintaining above this support would be crucial for sustaining bullish sentiment on the market.Dogecoin's impressive performanceDogecoin's market shows a significant concentration of holdings, with 63% of Dogecoin's total supply held by large holders apart from the 80% profitability of the asset. This concentration can lead to increased price volatility as decisions by a few can significantly impact the market's price. Additionally, the holder composition by time held reveals that a majority, 65%, have held their tokens for over a year, indicating strong loyalty or long-term speculation among holders.The overall market signals for Dogecoin are mostly bearish, with on-chain signals indicating slight bearish sentiment due to a minor decrease in the money metric and large transactions. This could suggest a cautious approach by investors in response to recent price movements or broader market conditions. Exchange data reveals $278.73 million in outflows, which might indicate that some investors are moving their holdings off exchanges, possibly to private wallets for long-term holding or in response to market uncertainty.Looking at the Dogecoin price chart, it is currently testing a crucial support level around $0.12 which is represented by the 200 EMA. If this level holds, it could prevent further declines; however, if it breaks, Dogecoin could see lower lows. On the upside, resistance lies near $0.15334, and a break above this could signal a potential recovery.

OpenAI Could Challenge Google and Perplexity With AI-Powered Search: Reports - Decrypt

Already top of mind in the red-hot artificial intelligence space, OpenAI could be working on an AI-powered search engine to challenge tech titan Google, as well as the web-savvy AI tool Perplexity.The tantalizing face-off over the future of finding information online is emerging from rumors and purported insider leaks. The first hints surfaced in February, when The Information reported that OpenAI was developing a search app aimed at Google's core competency.If true, it would be a marked departure from the company's current arrangement with Microsoft to use Bing to give ChatGPT access to the web. Bing uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve answers by folding data from web searches into GPT-4 chatbot responses—giving it an edge in terms of currency of information.More recently, a well-known leaker in the AI space who goes by the pseudonym Jimmy Apples asserted that OpenAI could announce a new search engine soon. Citing a flurry of new domain name records emanating from chatgpt.com, he posited that the Mountain View, Calif.-based firm is preparing to host an event to showcase this new capability."10am, 9th of May for an OpenAI event apparently, might not be model release but search engine announcement,” he tweeted. “Guess they can’t help themselves to upstage Google I/O"—the annual developers conference scheduled to kick off on Tuesday.Ashutosh Shrivastava—another Twitter user who is active in the AI community—delved further, claiming that OpenAI had been very active with a new subdomain named search.chatgpt.com."OpenAI's recent SSL certificate logs revealed something interesting: the domain (search-dot-chatgpt-dot-com) may indicate that OpenAI is developing a search functionality. " he said.A standard WHOIS domain registry search confirms that the subdomain exists, but attempts to access it fail.Jimmy Apples also said OpenAI may be testing more features or AI models."I count at least 50+ new async subdomains since the 24th of April," he tweeted, speculating that a new ChatGPT search engine might offer faster responses than its main chatbot and feature strong summarization capabilities.Web search and AIUntil the explosive debut of consumer-ready AI tools like ChatGPT, Google was the king of search, providing the main way people found information online. But its central position is being challenged as users become more comfortable asking a chatbot for answers than conducting a Google search.For some, the shift can't come soon enough, as Google search results are increasingly crowded with paid placement and sites that exist only to draw search traffic.On the other hand, the currency and completeness of information provided by AI models is often a weakness of chatbots—as well as devices intended to make the smartphone obsolete. Two high-profile AI gadget releases in the past month—the Humane AI pin and the Rabbit R1—have laid bare the limitations of this much-hyped approach to ubiquitous computing.Some companies are already combining AI and search. Perplexity is an AI-powered search engine that has built up a reputation in the AI space and drawn major investments from Nvidia and Jeff Bezos. Recently, Microsoft —which is OpenAI’s leading investor—banned employees from using Perplexity for security reasons. And while its reach is miniscule compared to tools from OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, Perplexity is seeing historic levels of interest right now, according to Google Trends.Image: Google TrendsIf OpenAI develops a native GPT-powered search engine, it would go head to head with Google Search, which has essentially owned this critical facet of the internet since it's launch in 1998. It will also immediately dwarf Perplexity's leadership in the more niche area of AI-powered search engines.Marketing platform Semrush estimates that there are 5.9 million Google searches conducted each minute, adding up to 8.5 billion searches per day or 3.1 trillion searches per year. Only 17 months old, ChatGPT currently has about 1.6 billion visits per month, while Perplexity is used by 10 million people every month.In a recent podcast with Lex Fridman, OpenAI chief, Sam Altman hinted at OpenAI's interest in reinventing web search.“The intersection of LLMs plus search, I don’t think anyone has cracked the code on yet,” he said. “I would love to go do that. I think that would be cool.”As of now, there has been no official announcement from OpenAI regarding the development of a search engine, and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comments from Decrypt. But based on its founders enthusiasm for the space, a new AI search engine seems more likely than not.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Crypto Whales Snatch Up $2.9 Billion in Bitcoin in Single-Day Frenzy | Cryptoglobe


                                
Large cryptocurrency holders, colloquially known as whales, have accumulated nearly 47,000 Bitcoins in the past day worth around $2.9 billion, according to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant.



The data, shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) by the company’s founder and CEO Ki Young Ju, shows the balances of cryptocurrency whales last active over the past 24-hour period surged exponentially, with the CEO saying “we’re entering a new era” as a result.







The whale accumulation came after a recent price dip that saw Bitcoin’s pricep lunge from over $60,000 to a low just below the $57,000 mark before it quickly started recovering, with the cryptocurrency having surged more than 4.5% over the last 24 hours to now trade at $61,700.



As CryptoGlobe reported some institutions may be among those buying the dip, as BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe whose asset management arm has over $600 billion in assets under management, has gained exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin via a spot exchange-traded fund.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

According to a recent 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the bank has purchased shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), as first reported by Bitcoin Magazine.



Large institutional investors managing over $100 million in assets have to, every quarter, disclose their holdings via 13F filings and after the successful launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., these filings have been closely watched by industry sleuths.



Notably, an executive at BlackRock has revealed sovereign wealth funds are showing interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF, and could start trading it over the next few months.



Such an investment would show a significantly different attitude towards digital assets. Foreign wealth funds like Kuwait’s Invstment Authority (KIA), the oldest sovereign wealth fund in the world, and Norway’s well-known $1.6 trillion wealth fund, could make ripples in the market with even conservative allocations.

Fantom Revival: Crypto Analyst Predicts A Jump To $1.2 For FTM Price


                            Fantom (FTM) had initially reclaimed the $1 level back in March and expectations were that the coin would rise to $2. But that was before the market crash sent prices spiraling, and Fantom lost almost 50% of its value during this time. However, all hope is not lost of for the coin, as one crypto analyst expects a return of the bullish momentum as long as certain conditions are met.
Fantom Searching For Support
Crypto analyst MyCryptoParadise took to TradingView to share their analysis on the Fantom price and how it could see a recovery. After the price fell to $0.56, the altcoin began to look for support, which would serve as a bounce-off point, and the analyst revealed that the altcoin is actually getting closer to this support.

For now, the support lies at $0.5679, which is the point that bulls need to hold to confirm a bullish breakout. Following a rejection at the $0.79 resistance, this point has become even more important to hold, as the FTM price searches for “renewed momentum.”
“Should FTM successfully find support and bounce from this level, it could potentially form a double bottom pattern, with the neckline acting as resistance around the 0.798 mark,” the crypto analyst said, highlighting the importance of finding support.
In the event of a breakout, the analyst expects at least a 100% move from here. The first major level to break it the $1 level, and then after that, the crypto analyst sees the price going as high as $1.2 as long as the trend is confirmed.

FTM Could Break Down Further
On the flip side of this, the crypto analyst also identifies a scenario where the Fantom price could continue to break down. In the event that the altcoin is unable to find support above $0.56 and breaks through it instead, the bloodbath could continue.

The bearish continuation which the analyst sees in a situation like this will send the price below $0.5 eventually. The support for the FTM price then lies at the next Bullish OB area, which the crypto analyst identifies to be around $0.449.
“💎 Reclaiming the support at 0.568 would be crucial for FTM to maintain its bullish momentum,” the analyst said. “Should FTM fail to bounce even after reaching the Bullish OB area, it would signal a bullish invalidation, indicating a continuation of the bearish trend.”
Presently, the Fantom price is trending above support at $0.6641. However, it is down 3% in the last day with 10% losses in the last week.

Dogecoin's $1 billion loss means its $0.15 price target is... - AMBCrypto



DOGE’s price might slip below $0.13 since liquidity in the derivatives dropped
Fewer coins moved over the week, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s run has taken a break

According to Coinglass, since 1 April, Dogecoin’s [DOGE] Open Interest has fallen from $2.11 billion to $780 million. Here, Open Interest (OI) is the value of open positions in a contract. The metric increases or decreases based on net positioning.
If the OI increases, it means new money is coming into the market and buyers are aggressive.
A lot of money leaves DOGE
However, the OI decline for Dogecoin implies that contracts worth over $1 billion were closed in a little over 30 days. From a trading perspective, this means that sellers have been aggressive while most traders took liquidity out.
This inefficiency has also affected DOGE’s price. According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE was valued at $0.13 at press time. This figure alluded to a 28.11% price fall in the last 30 days alone.
Source: Coinglass
While the memecoin’s price appreciated over the last 24 hours, in light of the OI decline, it does not seem that the aggressive downside would stop soon. If this is the case, DOGE might either hold on to $0.13 or a decline to $0.11 could be next.
Furthermore, the broader market shares a similar sentiment too. AMBCrypto noticed this after evaluating the Weighted Sentiment.
According to data from Santiment, Dogecoin’s Weighted Sentiment was -0.411. This reading implies that market participants do not expect a short-term recovery for DOGE.
Besides this, we considered the Funding Rate. Funding Rate is the cost of holding an open perp position. If funding is positive, it means longs are paying shorts a fee.
No way to $0.15 now
A negative reading implies that shorts are paying longs. At press time, DOGE’s Funding Rate was positive but moving lower. As the price moves higher and funding drops, perp buyers might be in disbelief.
With little to no aggression from longs, DOGE’s price might evade flipping the overhead resistance. Therefore, an upswing past $0.15 might be impossible within the next few days.
Source: Santiment
Furthermore, activity has started to rise again on Dogecoin’s network. On 25 April, the number of active addresses on the network was less than 50,000.
Active addresses show the number of wallets interacting with a project. At press time, that number had increased to 67,200— Meaning that users are back to making a lot of transactions on the network.
However, this metric was nowhere near the levels seen when DOGE changed hands at $0.20. If the metric stays at this level, DOGE’s price might hike, but it is almost certain that the uptrend will not last.

Additionally, the one-day circulation was 2.54 billion, indicating that Dogecoin’s usage fell on the charts. Ergo, as long as fewer coins are moved, DOGE might remain stuck within a tight range.

Nigeria poised to outlaw P2P crypto trading over national security concerns

Nigeria’s National Security Adviser (NSA) is set to label crypto trading as a national security threat, signaling an impending crackdown on peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto transactions, according to local media reports and CryptoSlate sources.The move follows the decision of at least three major Nigerian fintech startups — Moniepoint, Paga, and Palmpay — to block accounts involved in crypto dealings and report such activities to law enforcement.According to Moniepoint CEO Tosin Eniolorunda, the NSA’s classification is expected to pave the way for new regulations banning P2P crypto trading, with an official announcement anticipated soon.This represents a notable shift in regulatory stance, particularly after the Bola Tinubu administration had previously shown a more lenient attitude toward crypto. In fact, in December 2023, the Central Bank of Nigeria lifted a two-year ban on crypto transactions, hinting at a more welcoming regulatory environment.However, recent months have seen a reversal in this trend, with authorities blaming crypto speculators for exacerbating the volatility of the foreign exchange (FX) market. The proposed ban on P2P trading is based on the Central Bank’s assertion that crypto traders exploit this method to manipulate the Nigerian naira through pump-and-dump schemes.Central Bank Governor Olayemi Cardoso alleged in February 2024 that Binance had facilitated $26 billion in untraceable transactions, leading to a crackdown on the exchange and the freezing of over 1,000 bank accounts linked to P2P transactions.In a related development, four prominent fintech firms were recently directed to halt the opening of new customer accounts, though the source of this directive remains unclear.Moniepoint’s CEO, Tosin Eniolorunda, confirmed that the move was at the behest of the NSA, who expressed concerns over the ease with which fintech platforms facilitate account openings, particularly Tier 3 accounts.While a spokesperson for the NSA declined to provide further details, this development highlights the increasing scrutiny over the rapid proliferation of accounts facilitated by fintech startups. Traditional banks have long raised concerns that such accounts serve as conduits for illicit funds.Responding to these concerns, the Central Bank amended its rules in December 2023, mandating fintech startups to verify the identities of all account holders by March 2024.As Nigeria braces for further regulatory measures in the crypto space, the fate of P2P trading remains uncertain amid mounting national security concerns and evolving regulatory landscapes.

                        Friend.tech native token $FRIEND fell 50% on May 3 after its debut as the largest whale dumped their holdings. Meanwhile, users couldn’t access their airdropped tokens.As BaseScan data shows, within hours of the airdrop, the largest holder, “Murphys1d,” sold over 55,000 of the newly issued $FRIEND.This led to an immediate 53.3% drop in the token’s price from $3.26 to $1.30 as of writing. Friend.tech Community Unable to Access Airdrop 
Beyond the sell-off, some users were unable to claim their airdrop, forcing them to watch helplessly as $FRIEND’s price plummeted. Crypto investor Luke Martin commented that this just “adds insult to injury.”This issue is much at fault for liquidity issues – the market’s inability to absorb large buy and sell orders at stable prices.In a low liquidity environment, a few large orders can have an outsized impact on the market price.$FRIEND only had $0.01 worth of liquidity, leaving holders vulnerable. The extremely low liquidity evoked outrage within the community.“First you milk your users with fees, then you get them to add liquidity so that they can dump on each other,” disgruntled X user mcSleuth commented.Airdrop Farmers Continue to Plague Token Launches
Friend.tech dump is just one example of a professional airdrop farmer. These “squatters” interact with emerging protocols solely for the airdrop rewards, often with multiple wallets to compound rewards.This comes at a heavy cost to the communities surrounding the protocols squatters target. Dumps create major selling pressure, causing legitimate protocol users to panic and sell their holdings. In April 2024, Omni Network was similarly affected by Sybil farmers. Their native OMNI token fell 55% in less than 18 hours following its airdrop, losing over half of its market capitalization. While these events can have a huge negative impact on price action, it is only often short-term. $FRIEND may struggle following this event, but its community of investors may pull it through in the long term.

5 Solana Memecoins That Could Skyrocket Over 9,000% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Web3 gaming reception shifts from skepticism to enthusiasm: Shrapnelâs Head of Studio - Crypto Briefing




Blockchain gaming is received with excitement by 46% of traditional PC gamers, according to a survey by Web3 PC games distribution platform Ultra. This signs a possible shift in how traditional gamers perceive the blockchain gaming industry, something that Don Norbury, Head of Studio at Shrapnel, discussed with Crypto Briefing.Norbury said that during this year’s edition of the Game Developers Conference (GDC), he could witness this shift in the gaming community after attending the event for the third time as a Shrapnel team member, adding that he uses GDC “as a measuring stick for sentiment in the game development community,” as gamers’ sentiment don’t always line up.“I would say three years ago, which was really when we just started the idea of Shrapnel, it was kind of curiosity, like stifled curiosity about just this blockchain thing. And people [developers] weren’t contrary to consumer sentiment, they weren’t outright hostile,” shared Norbury.A good thermometer of how the traditional gaming community didn’t have an appreciation for this industry is the famous post by Linkin Park member Mike Shinoda about the matter in January 2022. Back then, gamers flooded the publication’s commentary area rejecting the idea of having crypto or non-fungible tokens in their games.This sentiment started changing when blockchain games showed their value to the gaming industry and people started asking themselves “why wasn’t it always the way to do things?” stated Norbury.“I would say that [the shift happened] a year ago, when we came up with an MVP that was called MPX, a multiplayer experiment, and we did a behind-closed-doors demo where we invited people all week long and it was massively oversubscribed. And at that time, the people that we were talking to had moved to conversations about how are we going to solve these problems that are very much typical game dev problems, which are like, ‘how are you gonna prevent cheating?’,” explained Shrapnel’s Head of Studio.Moreover, creators of mainstream games, such as multiplayer first-person shooter Valorant, started discussing more aspects of gaming. “Like ‘nerding out’ game dev attitude, as opposed to asking questions about like what blockchain was or what token economies were.”In this year’s edition, Norbury joked that Shrapnel’s team “almost needed a lot of bouncers,” because the interest from attendees in the game was higher than ever.“Everybody wanted to talk to us about how we were doing what we were doing, how they could get into it, how to avoid certain pitfalls, how do we structure, foundations in our company. I couldn’t go three feet without somebody wanting to engage and learn more.”Different from previous editions, gamers could see in this year’s GDC how fun and full of energy Web3 gamers are through Shrapnel, added Norbury.From Web2 to Web3Don Norbury and most of Shrapnel’s team have an extensive ‘Web2 gaming’ background, working on well-known titles such as Bioshock Infinite. He told Crypto Briefing that the main difference between these gaming universes is that Web3 is very much about ownership, affordance, transportability, and interoperability.“These are the reasons we’re even building our technical infrastructure the way that we are so that everything in Shrapnel from the get-go can go to any chain and any platform. It’s all built that way natively,” added Norbury.Furthermore, since Web3 is about giving ownership of assets to the players, it demands a special and constant awareness of open market economics. “Now you have to think of something having a limited supply, right? Having reinforced scarcity. You don’t always have to do that, but you need to be aware of what the repercussions are.”Web3 and esports togetherEsports, the competitive sector of the games industry, is an important part of this ecosystem nowadays, projected by Statista to reach $4.3 billion in revenue this year. One of the latest developments connecting esports and gaming is the $120 million investment made by Saudi Arabia to boost both sectors in the country.Norbury believes that a competitive landscape created on Web3 gaming is relevant, and could provide a “much-needed catalyst” for its success. Although highlighting parts of esports that need solving, such as quick seasons, the life cycle of teams and gamers, and mimicking some of the wrong aspects of traditional sports, he shares that esports and gaming are “a natural marriage.”“It’s not just a business model problem. I think there’s an ongoing fandom, people’s interests, and willingness to pay money to go to an event or watch something. […] I think that Web3, and we’re taking this approach from an e-sports perspective, offers a unique avenue to allow more grassroots esports as opposed to these giant LAN events or giant like the Overwatch League where you had to pay millions and millions of dollars right out of the gate just to have your org be part of it.”Moreover, Norbury highlights the gaming guilds in Web3, which he describes as “networks of humans that are already together and have similar interests with different specialties.”“Some of them are players, some of them are promoters. Some people are just like all about the financing side of it, right? But you look at it and if you squint, they kind of have the same shape as what you would expect a tournament promoter or an organization to have.”Therefore, the relationship between Web3 gaming and esports has a bi-directional value from Norbury’s perspective, where the structure of both industries boost each other.“It’s not just this one thing from a business perspective that they [Web3 gaming guilds] are trying to do. It’s almost like a brand thing, a marketing thing, a social thing. And I think that’s the shape within Web3 that’ll ultimately succeed the most,” he concludes.

Is Internet Computer Going to Zero? ICP Price Drops 2.3%, Investors Rush Into This New GambleFi Token / Source: Cryptonews
                        Investors are concerned that promising cryptocurrency Internet Computer (ICP) could be headed to zero, with its rally since late 2024 looking at risk of petering out and are instead turning to a promising new GambleFi token called Mega Dice (DICE).ICP was last changing hands at $13.64 and is attempting to push back above its 21DMA.The cryptocurrency has been probing an uptrend that has been in play since late 2023.Should this uptrend snap, a quick fall back to $10 is on the cards.With ICP is at risk of breaking lower towards $10, investors are checking out this exciting new GambleFi token. Source: TradingViewInternet Computer is a decentralized blockchain network that is attempting to realize the vision of a functional global computing network.Despite launching back in May 2021, ICP has failed to garner much by way of real-world adoption.The blockchain last had only around $95 million in cryptocurrency locked in smart contracts, as per DeFi Llama.That a paltry amount compared to Ethereum, which has $134 billion.It’s no surprise then that some investors fear that ICP will never gain real-world traction and will go to zero.That’s a risky bet to make. ICP is a highly speculative coin, which remains subject to abrupt rallies as risk appetite picks up.But ICP may never make it back to its 2021 highs near $350.With ICP at risk of dropping back below $10, it’s no wonder that investors are checking out this new GambleFi token called Mega Dice (DICE).ICP Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice (DICE)
Crypto investors looking for investments with greater upside potential than ICP should check out presale investing.Web3 projects and protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to raise funds for development.If presale investors can find a good project that gains traction in the market, they can book exponential gains.One project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is Mega Dice Casino.This already well-established crypto casino has launched a presale of its utility token DICE.DICE holders get big cashback benefits on their wagers and can also generate passive income via DICE staking.The crypto casino is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors.The project has already raised $700,000. And potential investors better move quickly, as when the $1 million milestone is hit, the DICE price will rise.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presale

                        OpenAI’s ChatGPT’s absence in China has created a unique opportunity for a new wave of artificial intelligence startups in China, each vying to fill the void and establish themselves as leaders in the generative AI space.Backed by major regional investors, these startups are developing advanced AI systems capable of producing various content, from images and text to music, posing a major challenge to OpenAI’s global supremacy.Chinese Startups Challenging the Reign of OpenAI
Four key startups have become leaders in China’s AI sector, each achieving unicorn status with valuations exceeding $1 billion. Zhipu AI, backed by giants like Alibaba Cloud and Tencent, is leading with a valuation of $2.5 billion. They focus on providing comprehensive AI solutions and have amassed a team of 800 employees.Moonshot AI, also valued at $2.5 billion, targets students and office workers with its text summarization technology. Their AI chatbot, Kimi, experienced explosive growth, with over 12 million visits in March alone.OpenAI Alternatives
MiniMax, based in Shanghai, takes a unique approach, employing anime-themed characters to engage the gaming market. Their interactive avatars, valued at $2.5 billion, can generate responses, jokes, and even flirt with users. Meanwhile, 01.ai, with a valuation of $1.2 billion, focuses on open-source models tailored for the Chinese market, such as the productivity-focused Wanzhi.“There is no winner of foundation models yet in the China market. These are some of the names leading the charge to claim that title,” Charlie Dai, Vice President and principal analyst at tech-focused consultancy Forrester, told the Financial Times.This diverse range of approaches demonstrates China’s AI startups’ adaptability as they compete with OpenAI.With approximately 262 AI-focused startups offering ChatGPT alternatives to the Chinese market, the race for AI dominance is heating up. As these Chinese startups continue to advance and grow, they can reshape the future of generative AI, challenging OpenAI’s position and offering new possibilities for the industry.

DOJ charges former Cred execs over $783M fraud and money laundering scheme - Crypto Briefing




The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced charges against three former executives of the now-bankrupt crypto lending and investing firm Cred, alleging their involvement in a scheme that led to customers losing crypto holdings currently valued at over $783 million.The accused individuals include Cred co-owner and former CEO Daniel Schatt, former CFO Joseph Podulka, and former CCO James Alexander. IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Mark Mosley described the defendants’ alleged activities at Cred as a “predatory, deceptive scheme.”According to the indictments, the executives made numerous false statements starting no later than March 2020, claiming that Cred only engaged in collateralized and guaranteed lending, utilized hedged crypto investments, and had all-weather protection against volatility. Marketing materials also allegedly falsely advertised Cred as a licensed lender with comprehensive insurance.“The indictments levied demonstrate the investigative capabilities of IRS Criminal Investigation and our commitment to pursuing justice against financial criminals,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Mark Mosley.Even after a 2020 flash crash, the executives allegedly portrayed Cred as solvent and promised that insurance would make customers whole. Despite Cred’s General Counsel admitting potential insolvency, the executives allegedly sought new customer funds instead of disclosing the firm’s true financial situation.The executives also allegedly failed to disclose that nearly all customer yields were generated by a single company making micro-loans to Chinese gamers.A federal grand jury charged each of the three individuals with varying counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering, with combined maximum sentences amounting to decades in prison and millions of dollars in fines.Schatt and Podulka made their first court appearance on May 2 and are scheduled to return on May 8, while Alexander’s initial appearance is pending. The case is proceeding in the Northern District of California.“This prosecution demonstrates our determination to keep our markets free of fraudsters and safe for investors,” said U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey.The DOJ’s announcement comes amid a series of recent cases targeting individuals in the cryptocurrency industry, including charges against Bitcoin proponent Roger Ver for alleged tax evasion and against the founders of the privacy-enabled crypto wallet Samourai Wallet.At the time of Cred’s bankruptcy filing on November 7, 2020, customers had suffered losses of cryptocurrency assets with a market value of $150 million, which has since risen to a potential maximum market value of over $783 million.

Memecoins Resurgence? POPCAT And MEW Surge 20%


                            As the crypto market settles in on this new phase of the crypto cycle, some memecoins have shown remarkable performance over the last couple of days.
Cat-theme tokens have significantly grown in popularity during this bull run, with some, like Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW), making it to the top 10 memecoins list. Other feline-inspired tokens like Popcat (POPCAT) and Wen (WEN) have had a stellar week after recent partnerships that caused the price to surge by 20% overnight.

Was The Memecoin Surge Fueled By Bitcoin?
The memecoins sector has been dominated by dogs, with tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) being the flagship memecoins for the last few years. During this bull cycle, dog-themed tokens like Bonk (BONK) and dogwifhat (WIF) have been the talk of the town, and some of the tokens with the strongest performance.
Since its launch in January 2023, Bonk has surged around 4291%, while WIF has soared about 1512% since December 2023. Moreover, the sector has shown stellar performances with cryptocurrencies like PEPE and Book of Meme (BOME).
Bitcoin (BTC) has dominated this cycle alongside memecoins, as highlighted by top crypto analysts like Alex Krüger and Altcoin Sherpa. However, their performance has been strongly co-related to BTC’s in most cases.


The rest of the market has gone down with Bitcoin whenever the flagship cryptocurrency faces a strong retrace. Consequentially, when BTC has recovered, most sectors, including memecoins, have regained their levels. It’s worth noting that some tokens like Popcat have continued to perform well, even during the recent rally slowdowns.
On Thursday, Bitcoin successfully tested the $59,000 resistance level after spending most of May’s first days hovering between $57,000-$58,000. In the last hours of the day, the largest cryptocurrency seemingly turned the resistance level into a support zone, pumping the price of several memecoins.
As a result, the memecoin market was 9.46% up on Thursday night. Similarly, cat-themed tokens were up by 22.09% with a market capitalization of $1.581 billion, per CoinMarketCap data.
Cat-Themed Memecoins Take The Lead With Popcat
Despite dominating the memecoins market, canine-inspired tokens have lost some ground against the increasing popularity of feline-inspired ones. While the cats’ tokens had increased over 20% in the previous 24 hours, the dogs’ sector only surged 3.7% in the same timeframe.
Over the last few days, cat-themed memecoins have been among the top gainers in the crypto market. For instance, Popcat has remarkably maintained its upward trajectory during the recent retrace and also joined the top 10 memecoins list.
Popcat, which seems to be building a loyal community, has continuously shown double-digit gain percentages this week. As reported by SolanaFloor, the token momentarily flippled BOME with its $570.3 million market capitalization.
Moreover, as Bitcoin reclaimed the $59,000 level, the cat-themed token saw a 31% price increase in the daily timeframe. This made Popcat the largest gainer among the top ten memecoins.
According to memecoin analyst Murad, Popcat will surge to $5-10 in the short-term as “the Crowned Top Cat.” As the token reached its all-time high (ATH) of $0.618 on Thursday, the trader highlighted several targets, including a long-term $20 scenario.

Murad expects the token “to go to $1 quickly” next time it closes above $0.63. Per the analysts, “It’s Cat Season baby and $POPCAT is in control.”
MEW Remains A Popular Cat
A month ago, MEW joined the dogs’ pack after becoming the eighth largest memecoin by market capitalization. Since then, the lonely cat’s performance has struggled, with a 51.8% and 28.4% price decrease in the monthly and weekly timeframes.
Despite the recent drop in performance, the token has remained one of the hottest topics among altcoins. On Monday, crypto exchange Bidget crowned MEW as the most searched altcoin on the exchange, beating PEPE and SOL on the “#BidgetTrendingSpot.”
At the time of writing, the token has shown a remarkable 12% price recovery in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $0.00424.

However, the corrective phase might end soon, going by the predictions of popular on-chain analyst Ali Martinez. On ADA’s daily chart, Martinez spotted a buy signal on the TD Sequential indicator, suggesting a potential relief rally for the next 1-4 days.
To make better sense of the forecast, AMBCrypto examined other key technical indicators of ADA.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) rose steadily in the last 2-3 days, a sign that selling pressure has been easing. That being said, the broader sentiment was still bearish and the RSI needed to rise above 40 to justify the prospect of a sustained rally. A move above neutral-50 would strengthen bullish sentiments.
The buying pressure was also apparent in the rise of On Balance Volume since the beginning of May. At press time, it mirrored ADA’s price action on the charts, raising hopes of a sustained rally.

Assessing whales’ response
Cardano’s downturn in price caught the attention of whale investors. On 30 April, transactions worth more than $100k spiked to their highest levels since November 2023.
On analysis of different whale cohorts, intriguing observations came to light. Smaller whales, with ADA holdings ranging from 1,000 to 1 million, decreased in number, suggesting that they have been selling off.
Larger whales, on the other hand, were accumulating, as addresses holding between 1 million to 100 million coins increased in number. Hence, it was evident that significant capital was flowing from smaller whales to bigger whales.

Former Cred execs face wire fraud and money laundering charges

Three former executives of bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Cred have been charged over allegedly engaging in wire fraud and money laundering prior to the firm declaring bankruptcy in November 2020.“This prosecution demonstrates our determination to keep our markets free of fraudsters and safe for investors,” the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California wrote in a May 3 statement.Former CEO Daniel Schatt and CFO Joseph Podulka face 13 charges of wire fraud and money laundering, while CCO James Alexander is charged with four counts.“It highlights a predatory, deceptive scheme defrauding potential victims of hundreds of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency at market value,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Mark Mosley.The three executives maximum sentence per count, if convicted.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank Holding $7,427,000,000,000 Off-Balance Sheet in Potentially Dangerous Cocktail of Unknown Assets: Report - The Daily Hodl


								JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank are keeping trillions of dollars in unknown and potentially risky assets off of their balance sheets, according to new data from the US government.
The new numbers – compiled by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) and first reported on by Wall Street on Parade – show JPMorgan Chase holds $3.227 trillion off-balance sheet, Bank of America holds $1.6 trillion off-balance sheet and Citibank holds $2.6 trillion off-balance sheet.










The Federal Reserve defines off-balance sheet activities as “quite diverse in nature” and says they may include such instruments as firm loan commitments, standby letters of credit, foreign exchange, financial futures, forward contracts, options, interest rate swap contracts and other derivative products.
Off-balance sheet accounting has been a common practice in the banking industry for years and as Wall Street on Parade notes, it played a major role in the 2008 financial crisis.
“More than other banks, Citigroup held assets off of its balance sheet, in part to hold down capital requirements… if those had been included, leverage in 2007 would have been 48:1, or about 53% higher…
Citigroup, of course, blew itself up in 2008 and received the largest bailouts in global banking history. By March of 2009, its stock was trading at 99 cents.”
In July of last year, the Federal Reserve announced a proposal that would impose higher capital requirements on banks to ensure their balance sheets are more resilient in economic downturns.
CEOs at JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon and State Street argued against the proposed changes in a Senate Banking Oversight Committee hearing in December.
In a prepared statement, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the changes would damage the banking industry and the economy at large.
“Despite zero evidence that large U.S. banks are undercapitalized today, the proposed Basel III Endgame rule, if enacted, would unjustifiably and unnecessarily increase capital requirements by 20-25% for the largest banks. 
Banks would be limited in their ability to deploy capital in the times we’re most needed, and the rule will have a harmful ripple effect on the economy, markets, businesses of all sizes and American households.”

How L2s like Optimism, Base, and Arbitrum are shaping up for May - AMBCrypto



Blast recorded explosive month-on-month growth in terms of new addresses
OP’s daily active addresses rose in May, while others saw their numbers fall

Layer 2s have made quite a buzz over the last few months because of their high network activity. As the first month of Q2 came to an end, Coin98 Analytics shared a monthly report highlighting the states of multiple top L2s, including Optimism [OP], Arbitrum [ARB], zkSync Era, and Base. 
L2s’ state in April 
Coin98 Analytics’ report revealed that OP dominated others in terms of total addresses, as its value stood at 138 million. Base and ARB trailed behind, with values of 71.9 million and 22.3 million, respectively. 
Moreover, OP also hit an all-time high on certain days this month, with over 450k new addresses per day. In April, Optimism recorded the highest number of new addresses created. Though OP’s numbers were the highest, Base and ARB also saw significant growth in April. 
Source: X
While the aforementioned L2s’ performance was commendable, Blast took the limelight because of its explosive growth. Coin98 found that Blast’s number of addresses grew by a whopping 42% in April, while OP, Base, and ARB’s growth rates were 2%, 4%, and 12%, respectively. 
The report additionally looked at L2s’ transactions in April. opBNB nabbed the first spot with over 872 million transactions. ARB, zkSync, and OP followed behind as their total transactions stood at 472 million, 346 million, and 257 million, respectively. 
Interestingly, Blast noted the highest growth rate in terms of transactions as well, with a hike of 112% month-on-month. 
Also, the top 4 Layer 2 protocols with the largest TVLs have seen significant shifts in money flows, with ARB sitting on top. Base recorded a 24% MoM hike with figures of over $284 million. On the contrary, Arbitrum registered a decline of over $371 million in TVL.
Source: X
How is May looking?
Since the month of April was pretty active for L2s, AMBCrypto then checked the latest data to find out how these aforementioned L2s have done so far in May. However, our analysis of Artemis’ data revealed that ARB, Base, and zkSync’s daily active addresses have started to fall.
Optimism acted differently as its active addresses rose. While Base and zkSync’s daily transactions declined, Base and OP’s numbers moved up slightly.
Source: Artemis

Realistic or not, here’s ARB market cap in BTC’s terms   

As far as captured value is concerned, Base had the highest revenue when May began, followed by OP. The declining trend was also true in this regard, as Base and zkSync’s graphs started to decline. 
On the other hand, ARB and OP’s revenue gained upward momentum in May. 
In light of these metrics, it seems likely that OP and ARB might see promising growth in May while Base and zkSync face some trouble.

MakerDAO announces launch of two new tokens | Cryptopolitan

MakerDAO has announced that it will launch two new tokens. The two tokens were announced in March and named NewStable and NewGovToken. These two tokens are intended for the broader participation of users in governance activities.  MakerDAO and announcement of new tokensMakerDAO is a global financial system that claims to have brought the first unbiased currency DAI. The mentioned currency is one of the leading stablecoins that is overcollateralized. Furthermore, the mentioned ecosystem is known for its decentralized governance adding to its value. Though there was a great controversy regarding algorithmic stablecoins MakerDAO’s DAI was able to steer clear.MakerDAO stablecoin is stabilized through cryptocurrencies as well as stablecoins like USDC. This protocol was launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain and its stablecoin is pegged to the US dollar. The protocol works by allowing loans in DAI while they have to use other cryptocurrencies as collateral.If a user wants to get a $100,000 DAI, they would have to collateralize $170,000 worth of ETH, thus providing it protection against potential problems. According to available information, DAI has been backed by the worth of about $10.6 billion assets in crypto while assets in the real world amount to $100 million.   In a big leap, MakerDAO has announced that it will launch two new tokens to further improve its governance model. The two tokens have been named NewStable and NewGOV. These two will be introduced to the ecosystem after the upcoming brand reveal. NewStable and NewGOVNewStable is an upgraded version of Dai which has been enhanced for broader adoption and improved stability. According to the official statement on X, the official name of NewStable will be unveiled in the upcoming brand reveal. The NewGOV token has been designed to improve the governance approach in the ecosystem. It has been designed in order to ensure that more users participate in the governance and the decision-making becomes robust. The process of the conversion of the tokens is simple where the users can upgrade to NewStable from Dai while they have an option to revert. In the case of NewGOV, 1 MKR can be converted to 24,000 NGT. The redenomination has been announced in order to improve the participation of users in governance. Furthermore, the statement has clarified that the two tokens will not replace DAI and MKR, rather they represent an expansion. The users will have the option to transition to the newly announced tokens.As per available information, NST holders can engage in the farming of NGT. 600 million NGT will be available on an annual basis to the participating NST holders. Farming won’t be available to US users while those accessing the services on VPN won’t be able to farm. According to the official sources, the strategic supply of NewGOV tokens has been redenominated in comparison to MKR.  What’s next?Those who participate in the farming or conversion to the new tokens will be able to utilize a range of benefits. These include access to new features and opportunities. Those who transition to the latest tokens will be able to gain access to the latest functions in the ecosystem. There is flexibility and choice as the new tokens are introduced, thus the users will be able to choose between the available options. These tokens are a gateway to future products and services and will provide entry to the evolving ecosystem. Interested users can stay connected to the Maker Ecosystem to get new updates. ConclusionMakerDAO has announced the launch of two new tokens, which have been codenamed NewStable and NewGOV. The two tokens will be officially revealed in the upcoming brand reveal event. The two tokens are aimed at bringing ease and facilitation to the users.

BTC-e operator has pleaded guilty to money laundering | Cryptopolitan

The US Department of Justice has continued to hunt those who have been involved in the criminal use of crypto. In a recent development, it announced that it had held a Russian national for his involvement with BTC-e. The mentioned person had been found involved in the use of crypto exchange for money laundering and has pleaded guilty. BTC-e and its operationsBTC-e was a cryptocurrency trading platform that had been in operation from 2011 to 2017. Its servers were based in the US while it served Russian nationals. The US government found out about the servers and other details in 2017 and seized its funds as well as the website. It was founded by Alexander Vinnik and Aleksandr Bilyuchenko.  The website held a considerable amount of Bitcoin exchange volume, amounting to about 3%. Later it was taken over by someone else and it was used for the financing of war in Donbass. The mentioned website was charged with money laundering in 2017 and the significant event was alleged involvement in the money laundering of the funds of Mt. Gox. In order to repay its customers, BTC-e created WEX tokens which were later presented as proof at court. These tokens presented a value of $1 and were issued to customer accounts to present the value of customers’ investments.Money laundering and BTC-e involvementOne of the leading persons behind the BTC-e was Alexander Vinnik who operated the mentioned cryptocurrency exchange. As the allegations of money laundering and other activities surrounding the mentioned website grew, Vinnik was arrested. Vinnik had worked as an operator of BTC-e from 2011 to 2017 and had processed a considerably big chunk of transactions. The number of processed transactions was about 1 million while the amount processed using these transactions in crypto amounted to $9 billion. The mentioned person was arrested in Greece in 2017 and it took a long process to extradite him to the US. Vinnik had initially denied that he was an operator at BTC-e, rather he claimed to have been only an employee. BTC-e hadn’t been registered as a money business service in the US. In addition to that, it hadn’t any KYC policy nor had it any rules to collect customer data to prevent money laundering. According to the press release from the US DoJ, the mentioned website received funds from different criminal activities. These activities included hacks, ransomware attacks, and other scams. Though France, Russia, and the US tried to ensure that Vinnik was extradited to their respective states, the US was able to make it. The US DoJ has said that this case shows their commitment to prevention and combating crypto crime. Furthermore, the guilty plea shows that DoJ has used all available resources and tools to fight money laundering. Transactions and losses caused by BTC-eAs said above, BTC-e processed transactions worth more than $9 billion from 2011 to 2017, which has caused huge losses. The number of transactions shows the huge number of crime perpetrators who have been involved in money laundering.  According to the press statement, Vinik had direct involvement in losses of more than $121 million. Alexander Vinnik had been proven guilty of willfully violating US AML laws while a $12 million civil penalty was pending. The affected might get restitution of their funds with the resolution of this case.  ConclusionUS DoJ has said in a statement that Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national, has pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering. The mentioned person had been involved in money laundering through the virtual cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e. The mentioned exchange was seized in 2017 by US authorities.

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) to Surge 7,000% Within 48 Hours, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Whale Alert: Massive 1.75 Trillion Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Purchase on Robinhood Draws Speculation | Cryptoglobe


                                
A major anonymous Shiba Inu whale wallet executed a series of large transactions on the popular Robinhood exchange, accumulating a staggering 1.75 trillion $SHIB tokens, valued at roughly $40 million.



The whale’s accumulation was first spotted by whale monitoring service Whale Alert, which pointed on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to two massive SHIB transactions off of Robinhood’s wallets to unknown wallets. Both transactions were of 875 billion SHIB, worth nearly $20 million.







This whale activity coincides with a potential bullish signal for SHIB. According to a recent post by Ali Martinez, a prominent cryptocurrency trader, Shiba Inu’s daily chart appears to be forming a “bull flag,” a technical indicator suggesting an imminent price surge. 



Anticipating this breakout, Martinez revealed plans to place buy orders around the $0.000018343 mark, aiming to capitalize on a potential rise in SHIB’s price.







As CryptoGlobe reported, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency has according to blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant seen its reserves on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges drop to their lowest level since February 2022.



CryptoQuant’s data also shows a predominantly negative SHIB exchange netflow over the past week, showing a large movement of tokens from centralized exchanges to self-custody wallets that suggests a decrease in immediate selling pressure, which is generally considered a bullish signal.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Beyond these exchange-related metrics, other developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem also hint at a potential price rise, with a growing SHIB burning rate helping remove tokens from circulation and reduce circulating supply.



SHIB’s cryptocurrency community has helped it maintain a strong social activity, with social intelligence firm Lunar Crush noting earlier this month SHIB is “signaling bullish” as it has been seeing increasing social activity paired with accelerating market volume and rising price action.



As CryptoGlobe reported, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency could, according to an analyst, surge in the near future based on technical analysis, as the analyst suggested its chart shows a symmetrical triangle pattern, often interpreted by traders as a bullish signal.



A symmetrical triangle pattern is formed by drawing trendlines, one falling and another one rising, along a converging price range. To confirm a valid break and not a false one, traders should look for a surge in volume and at least two consecutive closes beyond the trendline, according to Investopedia.



Symmetrical triangles usually indicate that the price will continue in the same direction as before the triangle formed. Therefore, traders would expect the price to break upward if a symmetrical triangle follows an uptrend.

The $1 Trillion Power Couple Reshaping Finance - The Daily Hodl


								
 
The DeFi (decentralized finance) market has staged an impressive comeback over the past 12 months – with the TVL (total value locked) across all protocols doubling to $93 billion.
Meanwhile, excitement surrounding the capabilities of generative AI continues to build.
A Bloomberg report suggests this industry could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032 and “fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates.”
DeFi and AI (artificial intelligence) are set to go from strength to strength in their respective fields over the coming decade.
But there’s been little discussion about the seismic impact these technologies can have if applied together – delivering exponential growth and revolutionizing finance on a global scale.
In the seven years since DeFi protocols came into existence, a blossoming ecosystem of financial applications and services have been built on top of blockchain networks, offering a modern, real-time parallel to the outdated and slow infrastructure relied upon by traditional institutions.
Smart contracts now offer self-executing agreements that eliminate the need for intermediaries and open up access to lending, borrowing, trading and saving – all with much more competitive interest rates.
When you peel away the complicated jargon and talk of liquidity pools and yield farming, the opportunities that DeFi presents are nothing short of mind-blowing.
In a world where access to banking services is governed by strict eligibility criteria that billions of people are unable to meet, these protocols can secure financial inclusion for unbanked and underbanked populations around the world.
Now, anyone can manage their money through a smartphone.
Funds can be sent and received instantly and cheaply without depending on gatekeepers who charge punishing fees, while those shut out of receiving a credit score can now build a reputation on the blockchain.
By bringing DeFi and AI together, a multi-trillion-dollar power couple begins to form with truly transformative use cases.
But what does this look like in practice – and what are the opportunities and challenges on the horizon as we redefine the future?










DeFi done right
AI’s ability to digest vast datasets in the blink of an eye, make intelligent predictions and connect the dots between trends is going to supercharge the world of DeFi.
We’re barely scratching the surface when it comes to the potential applications.
Algorithms powered by AI can analyze market trends, bringing together news coverage, social media posts, historical data and brand-new figures in the time it takes a human to get a cup of coffee.
Applied correctly, this allows traders to stay ahead of the curve, enables businesses to detect changing behaviors and helps forward-thinking entrepreneurs spot compelling opportunities for new goods and services.
What’s more, all of these in-depth insights can be delivered with full automation, saving time and boosting productivity.
Together, AI and DeFi will also reinvent the way we interact with money, personalizing financial services like never before.
Imagine an algorithm that makes bespoke recommendations on the products you’ll love based on past purchases or uncovers discounts for car rentals and accommodation when you’re booking flights.
While the barriers to entry surrounding investments and financial planning have started to come down in recent years, many consumers still lack the means and the know-how to prepare for a brighter future.
In the coming years, all of that will change, with AI-enriched platforms enabling investors to save regularly, invest wisely and budget meticulously.
And instead of adopting a ‘one size fits all’ approach, each user would be able to benefit from specific plans based on their income and outgoings – with investment portfolios and trading strategies tailored to an individual’s risk tolerance and long-term goals.
Broadening access to fintech can be done safely as AI and DeFi converge.
Both technologies will also prove invaluable in the fight against identity fraud, which cost Americans a staggering $23 billion last year.
Advanced analytics, fueled by machine learning, have the power to detect complex patterns of fraud in multiple locations instantaneously – while the cryptographic security offered by blockchain platforms helps remove some of the attack vectors commonly exploited by malicious actors.
This, when coupled with faster and more accurate KYC (know your customer) checks, can prevent funds from being stolen in the first place, and make DeFi platforms an even safer environment for storing assets.
A win-win situation for consumers and lenders also starts to emerge, thanks to a revolution in credit underwriting.
Applications can be scrutinized using alternative data points – enabling self-employed individuals to access capital rather than suffer arbitrary rejections – with users building a reputation score on immutable blockchains.
This leads to more informed lending decisions for DeFi platforms and the development of robust risk management strategies.
Leveraging machine learning, AI can automate the creation and execution of smart contracts, streamlining operations and eliminating the potential for human error.
We’re already starting to see innovative new projects take advantage of these capabilities like Zircuit, a layer-two blockchain with AI-enabled security, and Ritual, the network for open AI infrastructure.
Innovating responsibly
There’s so much to be excited about – and a lot to be working on. But against this backdrop of innovation, careful consideration must be paid to the potential pitfalls of a close integration between AI and DeFi.
Data quality, privacy and security are three crucial themes that innovators need to focus on as they build new products.
Robust safeguards need to be in place to shield protocols against adversarial attacks.
The complexities of regulatory compliance are another hurdle to overcome, with jurisdictions worldwide set to pay closer attention to both technologies in the years ahead.
There are also ethical implications to reflect on. The purveyors of AI tools need to ensure they mitigate the risk of algorithmic bias that leads to unjust outcomes.
State-of-the-art cybersecurity is required to ensure that the personal data processed by up-and-coming platforms isn’t misused for malicious purposes.
And as AI models are developed, transparency is needed to ensure potential errors can be remedied – and that the public has confidence in the systems they’re interacting with.
Let’s not forget that new technology also represents a steep learning curve for consumers, who can be resistant to change.
DeFi and AI have the potential to redefine finance as we know it.
By democratizing access, promoting inclusion and fostering a more transparent and secure ecosystem, this technological marriage could usher in a new era of empowerment for all.
But to truly unlock their potential, we must address future challenges head-on and ensure these tools are responsibly implemented.
The future of finance rests on our ability to harness the power of AI and DeFi for good.

DOGE, SHIB, PEPE Among Top Performers Daily, BTC Rises to $63K (Weekend Watch)


																Bitcoin’s recovery tour continues as the cryptocurrency jumped from under $59,000 yesterday to a multi-day peak of over $63,000 earlier today.
Most altcoins have followed suit with impressive gains once again, including the ever-volatile meme coin sector.
BTC Goes After $63K
Bitcoin had a highly adverse trading week as its price dumped hard on a few occasions. It all started positively on Monday morning when BTC pumped to almost $65,000, but the bears took control of the market immediately and pushed it south to $62,000.
The declines were far from over as the asset further slumped to and below $60,000. The correction culminated in a two-month low of $56,500 charted on Wednesday, ahead of the latest US FOMC meeting.
Once that was completed and the Fed said it will not raise the interest rates soon, BTC reacted with a $2,000 pump and dump and returned to its starting position. It started to recover more ground in the following hours and neared $60,000 yesterday, as reported.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


It was stopped there at first, but managed to break through that psychological resistance later that day. The bulls kept the pressure on and pushed BTC to a multi-day peak of $63,500. Despite losing some ground since then, bitcoin currently sits at around $63,000.
Its 6% daily increase means that its market cap has risen to $1.240 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands at 50.5%.

Grayscale’s GBTC stops bleeding: First inflow since launch

Grayscale Investments has achieved its first day of net positive inflows for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). This comes after nearly four months of continuous outflows since its conversion to a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January.On May 3, Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $63 million in inflows after recording approximately $17.5 billion of outflows since the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs launched on Jan. 11, according to Farside preliminary data.Among the other funds reported so far, Franklin Templeton's Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) saw its highest ever inflow with $60.9 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led the day's inflows with $102.6 million, followed by Bitwise Bitcoin Fund (BITB) with $33.5 million and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) with $33.2 million.Grayscale's GBTC recorded its first day of inflows on May 3. Source: Farside The crypto community has been speculating how the turn in events might impact Bitcoin’s (BTC) price. Pseudonymous crypto investor DivXman told his followers that the GBTC was the “primary source” of sell pressure across all spot Bitcoin ETFs, but “the tides” could be turning.“That effectively means a significant decrease in sell pressure and additional increase in demand while ETFs collectively are buying more BTC than miners can create,” he explained to his 20,800 X followers in a May 3 post.Crypto trader Jelle predicted to his 80,300 X followers on the same day that Bitcoin's new all-time high is on the horizon.“60 million dollars worth of inflows for Grayscale's ETF. The halving chop will come to an end, and 6-figure Bitcoin will follow shortly after.”Related: Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF ‘halves’ before BTC halvingMeanwhile, crypto trader Jordan Lindsey responded to the news by pointing to Bitcoin’s price saying it is “obviously responding both to outflows and inflows.”Bitcoin’s price has increased 4.91% over the past 24 hours to $62,840 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.Bitcoin has recovered after trading below a key support level at $58,926. Source: CoinMarketCapSeveral factors contributed to Grayscale’s ongoing outflows since the launch of the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. One reason is GBTC's high fees compared to other available ETFs. GBTC's fee is set at 1.5%, whereas the fees for other ETFs are all below 1%.The cheapest is currently Franklin Templeton with a 0.19% fee. Another main driver is bankrupt crypto firms FTX and Genesis selling off large amounts of GBTC shares in an effort to repay creditors.On April 6, Cointelegraph reported that Genesis liquidated approximately 36 million GBTC shares for the amount of $2.1 billion to purchase 32,041 Bitcoin. Magazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?
