Ethereum Adds Over 260K Wallets in 2 Days: Will ETH Rally? - DailyCoin


        
Ethereum has recently witnessed its most significant two-day network growth in nearly two years.



The network growth comes despite recent price struggles.



Macroeconomic conditions and an ongoing SEC investigation continue to weigh on the asset’s price.
Despite recent ETH price struggles, things are not looking all bad for the Ethereum network. Recent data suggests that at the start of the week, the network saw its highest influx of new accounts in nearly two years.Could this network growth be the catalyst ETH needs?Ethereum Network Gains Over 260K New WalletsLike most crypto assets, ETH experienced a steep decline this week amid jitters over the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision, which was announced on Wednesday, May 1. Despite this market uncertainty, Santiment Feed data has revealed that thousands were still jumping into the Ethereum ecosystem at a record rate.
On Wednesday, Santiment Feed disclosed that over 260,000 new Ethereum wallets were created between April 28 and April 29, the highest two-day network growth since October 8 and October 9, 2022. While the reason for the recent network growth spike is unclear, over the weekend, the Ethereum community saw some excitement as the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) stirred hopes of spot Ethereum ETF approvals by listing Franklin Templeton’s planned offering on its website.Regardless of the catalyst, the network growth metric has sparked optimism amongst some Ethereum users. This optimism comes as network growth is typically bullish for underlying crypto assets. Still, uncertainties remain.Overarching ConcernsSignificant growth in the number of addresses in a network is typically viewed as a sign of strong network fundamentals, highlighting a potential for increased capital inflows. 
However, the impact of this network growth is not always immediately reflected in price, particularly when investors have overarching concerns. At present, these concerns for Ethereum include continued high interest rates in the U.S. and the SEC’s unclear position on the asset’s classification.At the time of writing, ETH continues to trade below the psychologically important $3,000 price level at $2,991, per CoinMarketCap data.On the Flipside 
Despite recent price struggles, Ethereum is still up over 30% year-to-date (YTD) from an opening price of around $2,282.
Why This MattersEthereum is the second largest crypto asset in terms of market capitalization. While the recent network growth may not translate to immediate price gains, it suggests continued interest in the ecosystem.Read this for more on ETH:SEC to OK Leveraged ETH ETFs… While Probing Security Status?See how Polygon (MATIC) is reacting to the recent market downturn:Polygon (MATIC) Plunges in BTC-Led Flush: Can It Hold Support?

Bitcoin Institutionals Behind $57,000 Crash? Data Says So


								Data shows the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium has been negative for a while now, a sign that institutional selling has been occurring behind the scenes.
Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Turned Quite Negative Recently
As pointed out by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has been negative for seven straight days.
The “Coinbase Premium Gap” is an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the BTC prices listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair). When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is greater than on Binance right now. Such a trend implies the buying pressure is higher (or alternatively, the selling pressure is lower) on the former than the latter.

On the other hand, the indicator being red suggests the presence of higher selling pressure on the Coinbase platform, which has pushed the price of the asset lower on it.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past year:

The price of the asset appears to have been quite negative in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has been negative for the past week or so, implying that the selling pressure on Coinbase has been higher than on Binance.
Recently, the indicator has assumed some especially sharp negative values, which have coincided with the recent crash that the cryptocurrency has observed. This could suggest that selling on the platform may be behind the crash.
This has actually been the pattern observed in 2024 so far, as the asset’s price has seemed to be sensitive to changes in the metric. When the rally was ongoing earlier, the indicator had been at highly positive levels, but this buying seems to have ended now.
Coinbase is popularly known to be used by the American institutional entities, while Binance has a more global userbase. As such, the indicator’s value reflects how the behavior of the US-based institutional traders differs from that of the global investors.
Since the Bitcoin price has been reacting to movements in the Coinbase Premium Gap this year, it would appear that these whales have been driving the price action.

The latest red values of the indicator would imply that these investors have been participating in a selloff recently. As long as this streak of negative levels continues, it’s possible that Bitcoin will continue to observe bearish price action.
A flip towards the positive, on the other hand, would suggest at least sideways movement around the current levels, if not outright a switch towards bullish momentum. It now remains to be seen what moves the Coinbase users will make in the coming days.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $58,600, down over 7% in the last seven days.

Well-known cryptocurrency analyst il Capo of Crypto announced today that he opened a long position in Solana (SOL) following the recent declines in the crypto market.
The analyst said that SOL has reached an important support level at $131, and if this level is broken, the said support will turn into resistance. He also added that he sees a potential double bottom formation on the SOL chart.


However, the analyst, who shared another statement after his statement, said that he made another addition to his position after the price of SOL increased, and the average entry price for the coin was 133.71 dollars.
At the time of writing this article, SOL price is trading at $138.43.





However, it should not be forgotten that il Capo was wrong in many of his analyses. Although he has made bullish statements recently, the analyst reiterated his bearish views during the rally in which the BTC price rose to $ 70,000 and announced that he expected the BTC price to fall to $ 12,000.

Analysts have different opinions regarding Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market. il Capo said that BTC should receive liquidity between $57,000 and $59,000. Now he has announced that he prefers to wait for more signs of where the market will go.

Pantera invests in TON with high expectations for Telegram’s future

Pantera Capital has invested an undisclosed amount in The Open Network (TON). It is the crypto-focused venture capital firm’s “latest” investment in TON and motivated by its connection to the Telegram messaging service, the company said.Telegram’s decision in April to incorporate TON gives TON “potential to become one of the largest crypto networks,” Pantera said in a long and enthusiastic blog post on its website. Telegram, with its 900 million monthly users and 36.7 million monthly downloads, “is well positioned to bring crypto to the world because of its shared Web3 ethos.” In a laundry list of TON’s virtues, Pantera said the architecture of the TON blockchain provides performance and scalability that compares favorably with leading blockchains, and its wallet offers high utility with a simple interface. A comparison of scalability among major blockchains. Source: Pantera CapitalPantera also praised the mini-apps TON enables on Telegram:“Earlier this year, we observed how memecoin trading tools like BonkBot generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue through Telegram’s user interface. TON-based applications, such as StormTrade, now enable users to trade perpetuals, cryptocurrencies, stocks, and equities using the same interface.” Furthermore, Telegram is offering new opportunities for monetization, such as ad revenue sharing and tradable customized usernames, virtual phone numbers and emojis.Related: Tether issued on TON blockchain at a ‘great start,’ says CEO — Now at $60MThe Telegram-TON linkup was a notable achievement, Pantera noted. TON was originally designed to integrate with Telegram, but its initial attempt was foiled by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Telegram was able to reunite TON after the network was relaunched by independent developers, making it the only major messaging platform to incorporate Web3.

Coinbase Ranked As Top Spot Crypto Exchange in CCData's Latest Exchange Benchmark | Cryptoglobe


                                
CCData, a leading provider of digital asset market data and analysis, has recently released the latest edition (April 2024) of its highly anticipated Exchange Benchmark report. This comprehensive study, which has become an industry standard for evaluating the risk associated with cryptocurrency exchanges, offers valuable insights into the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.



The Exchange Benchmark, first launched in 2019, has undergone significant expansions and enhancements to its methodology, now encompassing over 100 exchanges across 8 key categories, including Security, Legal/Regulation, KYC/Transaction Risk, Team/Exchange, Data Provision, Asset Quality/Diversity, Market Quality, and Transparency. The report covers both centralized exchanges (spot and derivatives) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), with the latter being assessed based on a separate set of metrics tailored to their unique characteristics (Security, Community, Transparency, Governance, Market Quality, User Experience, and Incentives).



One of the key highlights from the April 2024 report is the continued dominance of Coinbase, which has maintained its top ranking for the second consecutive Exchange Benchmark. Coinbase’s strong performance can be attributed to its high scores in the Legal/Regulation and Security sections, which have been revamped to ensure the highest level of risk mitigation and accountability.



Out of the 98 spot exchanges evaluated, 17 achieved Top-Tier status (BB+ or higher), with Coinbase and Bitstamp being the only exchanges to score above 80 points. Kraken and Bybit also impressed, obtaining AA rankings with scores above 75. The report cites improved Market Quality, new VASP licenses, and the increased adoption of off-exchange settlement offerings as major drivers behind these top-tier scores.



In the derivatives space, 10 out of 27 exchanges reached Top-Tier status, with OKX and Bybit leading the pack with AA grades and scores of 82.5 and 81.2, respectively. Both exchanges scored full marks in the Derivatives Market Quality category, alongside Binance, which was thresholded due to a major negative event resulting from their recent CFTC settlement.



The April 2024 report also highlighted a significant increase in due diligence questionnaire submissions, with nearly 50% of Top-Tier exchanges across spot and derivatives markets providing completed DDQs. This trend reflects a growing commitment to transparency among leading exchanges and a desire to align with the increasingly robust Exchange Benchmark methodology.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

According to data from VASPnet, 68 out of 103 exchanges hold a VASP License, while 26 are registered as a Money Service Business. Notably, over 95% of Top-Tier exchanges are regulated, compared to only 60% of Lower-Tier exchanges.



The report also sheds light on the rising popularity of Off-Exchange Settlement solutions, which help mitigate counterparty risk by allowing assets to be mirrored on exchanges and traded natively while user funds are held in cold storage with regulated custodians. A total of 18 exchanges now offer access to this service, with 9 of them achieving Top-Tier status.



Despite the tougher criteria introduced in the latest benchmark, the overall performance of exchanges has improved, with the dominant grade remaining a B in the last two iterations. However, the number of AA-grade exchanges has declined by 43% since the last benchmark, reflecting the superior performance of leading exchanges.



Top-Tier centralized exchanges experienced a remarkable 775% surge in monthly volume, from ~$250bn in Oct-23 to ~$2.17tn in Apr-24, significantly outpacing the 313% increase seen among Lower-Tier exchanges. This trend highlights the market’s growing demand for robust risk mitigation and optimal market liquidity.



The report also underscores the importance of assessing counterparty risk factors, given the consistent uptrend in centralized exchange volumes, which grew by 345% since the last Benchmark, reaching an all-time high monthly volume of over $3tn by the end of March.



In terms of market quality, the report found that AA and A ranked exchanges account for 78% of the Daily Average Volumes across ranked exchanges during the collection period, while Top-Tier exchanges make up over 85% overall. This finding suggests that traders and investors prioritize volume and liquidity, especially when coupled with high regulatory compliance, robust infrastructure, and optimal market quality.



Finally, the report delves into the critical factors of spread and top-of-book liquidity, identifying Binance and OKX as the best-performing exchanges in terms of maintaining tight spreads and deep liquidity across key trading pairs.

Mom Sexualizes Herself on Livestream for Son’s Meme Coin-Then Ghosts - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsA kid and his mom begged viewers on their livestream to invest in their meme coin LIVEMOM while she bounced her boobs on camera.Then things got weird.The Kick stream, titled “live with mom,” launched early this morning and lasted just under an hour of the pair urging viewers to hit market cap milestones. If and when the market cap grew, the boy would do something degrading, like eating dog food, or his mom would sexualize herself, like doing 15 squats in front of the camera. And the ploy worked—at least, for a while.After the pair abruptly ended the livestream and deleted the associated social media accounts, the price of the token crashed, with early LIVEMOM buyers claiming the duo had rugged. Yet, somehow, the price of the token is now going up, as degen traders gravitate toward the LIVEMOM “lore.”“Do you wanna see him pour milk over these 36DDs?” the woman in the video, who claimed to be the boy’s mother, said to the livestream, bouncing her breasts at the camera. “[My son] actually suckled on these. Now he’s going to get to pour milk on them.” Incestuous degeneracy apparently goes viral quickly. The stream peaked at around 1,500 viewers within minutes. In turn, the token began to pump as eggs were cracked on the kid’s head, and the family begged viewers to pump the coin.Messages like “One nipple at 300K, deal?” flooded the chat. “Dudes 13 and pimping out his mom,” another said while others begged, “TAKE IT OFF PLS.”According to a viewer of the livestream, a pseudonymous trader who goes by “Doonhamer,” the token’s price directly correlated with what the mom was doing. If she went off screen, the token would drop. If she shook her boobs, the token would pump.“We were baffled, dude, we couldn’t believe it. This prepubescent, but also could have been of age, kid with his mom enticing viewers to buy a coin with his mom shaking the assets, the marketing,” pseudonymous viewer Shamrock told Decrypt. “I was laughing my ass off, until he rugged.”To be clear, we don’t know if the pair in the video are really mother and son, only that they portrayed themselves this way. It’s also possible that the male in the video is of age, though appears to be quite young. It’s also unclear if the pair cashed out and caused the price of the token to crash, but deleting social media accounts and ghosting your “investors” are the hallmarks of a cryptocurrency rug pull—a type of scam that is all too common in the space.When the token touched the $300,000 market cap milestone—which would have resulted in the mom doing 15 squats—the kid said that his phone ran out of battery. Viewers of the stream didn’t buy it. “Oh my phone died, damn damn damn,” the kid said, according to livestream viewers who spoke with Decrypt, suggesting his phone was the webcam, “We’ll run it back tomorrow.”At this same time, the token crashed from $310,000 market cap down to $129,000 in less than five minutes. Half an hour later, the stream came back on with a new token LIVEMOM2. Egg had been washed out of the kid's hair and the mom had changed her top. But this 15 minute stream didn’t see as much success, instantly falling to zero after reaching a $100,000 market cap.Since then, the project’s Kick and Twitter account have both been taken down. The duo has gone dark, yet to be heard from again.Since the initial crash, early buyers of the LIVEMOM token have reclaimed the project, in a sort of “community takeover,” by embracing the livestream as lore. At the time of writing, investors have pumped the token up to a $835,000 market cap with nearly 200 people in a Telegram voice chat discussing the chaos.DisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Altseason Alert: Bitcoin Dominance Crumbles, Altcoins Primed - DailyCoin


        
Crypto markets are caught in an accumulation period at present.



This week saw markets sell-off, with Bitcoin sinking to a new local price bottom.



A strong bounce in altcoins adds to calls of an incoming altseason.
Bitcoin tumbled to a nine-week low this week following the Fed’s decision to leave rates unchanged. Although the leading cryptocurrency has since made a muted recovery, growing 1.4% over the last 24 hours, altcoins have largely outperformed. A handful of the top 100 tokens, including PEPE, Wormhole, and Arweave, posted double-digit gains.Amidst this backdrop, Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) plummeted on Wednesday, which, coupled with altcoin overperformance, points to a potential altseason in the making.Bitcoin Dominance Tops OutBTC.D took a significant dip on Wednesday, falling from 54.87% to 53.91%, marking a four-week low while adding to calls of an incoming altseason.   BTC.D daily chart per Trading ViewBitcoin’s crypto market dominance has been trending lower since recording a year-to-date high of 57% on April 13. This trend has caught the attention of YouTuber Scott Melker, who believed this may have been the local top for Bitcoin Dominance.
Trader “Mikybull 🐂 Crypto” noted that Wednesday’s dip in BTC.D broke below a rising wedge pattern, and combined with bearish divergence on the Relative Strength Index, led him to conclude the move is the start of a downtrend that will culminate in an “explosive altseason.”However, while altcoins appear to be outperforming Bitcoin, that in itself is not a confirmation of altseason.Altseason On?There is no definitive agreed-upon definition of altseason. Still, these periods are typically characterized by outsized gains in altcoins relative to both Bitcoin and fiat currencies like the US dollar. Altseasons represent a shift in investor sentiment, as the dynamic involves capital flows out of Bitcoin into altcoin projects, reflecting a heightened appetite for risk among crypto investors.
A willingness to embrace higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities underscores the optimism and bullish sentiment that typically pervades the market during an altseason.Wednesday’s sell-off in crypto markets was met with a strong bounce in altcoins, as denoted by the long bottom wick on the daily May 1 candle of the total crypto market cap, excluding the BTC chart. This indicated that investors were quick to accumulate altcoins at discounted prices.Total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin per Trading ViewHowever, bears rejected a break above $1 trillion on Wednesday and again on Thursday, suggesting that altseason is not yet here. On the Flipside
There are countless incidents of Bitcoin Dominance waning, yet no altseason arrives.



Altcoins benefit from outsized percentage gains (and losses) due to having smaller market caps.

Bitcoin Market In Distribution: Are We Nearing A Bottom? - Benzinga

Since Bitcoin’s BTC/USD March all-time high of $73,000, the market has transitioned into a phase of widespread net distribution, with investors cashing in on profits.What Happened: In their latest report, Glassnode analyzes the nuances of investor behavior to identify potential turning points.Euphoria Phase with a Cool-OffWhile the Net Unrealized Profit & Loss (NUPL) metric confirms the ongoing Euphoria phase of the bull market, it has cooled down significantly since the correction began. This indicates a shift in sentiment compared to the rapid price appreciation seen earlier.Short-Term Holders Driving the MarketAnalyzing the breakdown of sell-side pressure reveals that short-term holders (those who recently acquired Bitcoin) are currently the most active sellers. Understanding their cost basis and spending patterns can offer insights into potential market bottoms.Identifying Potential Local BottomsGlassnode’s research introduces a framework for identifying potential local bottoms based on the behavior of short-term holders. Here are the key takeaways:
1w-1m Cost Basis: This metric tracks the average cost of Bitcoin for investors who bought within the last 1-4 weeks. It acts as a sensitive indicator of their selling pressure.



MVRV Ratio: This ratio measures the spot price against the 1w-1m cost basis, indicating how much below their average price recent buyers are willing to sell. During corrections, it typically falls within the 0.9-1 range.



Realized Loss: This metric measures the total USD value of Bitcoin sold at a loss by the 1w-1m holder cohort. Spikes in realized loss often coincide with market bottoms, as panicked selling intensifies. 
Also Read: BlackRock Anticipates Renewed Institutional Interest In Bitcoin Spot ETFsCurrent Market Conditions and Potential Bottom FormationAt the time of writing, the 1w-1m cost basis sits at $66.7k, while the MVRV ratio falls within the typical correction range. Additionally, realized loss for this group has surpassed the 90-day standard deviation threshold, indicating significant selling pressure.These factors suggest that the market might be hammering out a local bottom formation around the $60k-$66.7k range. However, a sustained break below the MVRV threshold could trigger further selling and establish a new equilibrium.This analysis by Glassnode provides valuable insights into the current state of the Bitcoin market. While distribution is the dominant trend, short-term holder behavior offers clues for identifying potential turning points and navigating market corrections.Looking Ahead: Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets EventEvents like Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 19 provide crucial platforms for industry leaders and analysts to discuss these evolving market dynamics and collaborate on navigating the complexities of the digital asset ecosystem.Read Next: Jack Dorsey’s Block Under Examination From Authorities Over Alleged Sanctions ViolationsThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

The move for an ‘undervalued’ bitcoin miner? Perhaps selling the company. - Blockworks


Stronghold Digital Mining executives want you to know they’re not happy about the company’s stock price.
As a result, they are considering selling the bitcoin miner’s assets. Or the company outright.
Such a sale could be among the first deals after the April 19 Bitcoin halving — when per-block mining rewards were reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Various industry watchers said they expected mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity to pick up following the event. 
Read more: Bitcoin miner consolidation appears imminent as halving looms
Executives touted the company’s attributes during Stronghold’s Thursday earnings call. 
It has 130 megawatts (MW) of energized data center capacity with an installed hash rate of 4.1 exahash per second. Stronghold also owns 750 or so acres of land, as well as the transmission lines that connect its assets to the PJM grid.
Stronghold’s current capacity could expand to more than 400 MW, with a potential focus on supporting the growing segments of AI and machine learning, Stronghold Greg Beard said on the call.
“We own a portfolio of hard assets where every known available comparable valuation is significantly in excess of the public market price of Stronghold today,” Beard noted. “Recognizing this dislocation, we have initiated a process to do something about it.”
The company has hired financial and legal advisors as part of a “formal strategic review process,” the company said in a Thursday news release.
Stronghold is considering “the sale of all or part of the company,” or another transaction that involves some or all of its assets, it added in a statement.
The company’s stock price was $3.16 at 12 pm ET — down 52% year to date.
This price plummet so far this year is more than most of the mining industry’s largest public competitors. Bitcoin mining behemoths Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Hut 8 for example, have seen share prices drop between 28% and 35% so far this year. 
Core Scientific stock is down just 5%, while CleanSpark is up 44% from the start of 2024.
Read more: How the Bitcoin halving could impact ailing mining stocks
Stronghold tallied net income of $5.8 million during the first quarter, executives said Thursday. It held $8 million in combined cash and bitcoin on its balance sheet, as of April 30, including 26 BTC.
Beard said Stronghold trades at more than a 70% discount on an enterprise value to hash rate capacity basis.
“While factors such as scale and leverage could explain a modest discount, trading at a fraction of our peers’ multiple continues to be hard for us to understand,” he added.
The Stronghold CEO previously told Blockworks that selling the company, or its assets, to an interested industry peer would be “something to consider.” 
“Generally speaking, companies that are misunderstood by the public market that have actual attributes and value that can be valued by other public companies…tend to be realized in that way,” Beard said last month. 
Read more: Financial trouble for bitcoin miners: A look back, and ahead as the halving looms 
Joe Flynn, an analyst at Compass Point Research and Trading, wrote in an April 9 research note that Stronghold’s debt and limited access to capital markets put it in a tough position. 
It could potentially reduce expenses and “high overhead” as a small public company by selling its “valuable” infrastructure and access to power, he added.
The Stronghold executives said there is no timetable for when its strategic review process will be complete. 
They then abruptly ended Thursday’s earnings call.
Beard said: “Given the sensitivity of the process that we’ve undertaken, we are not going to have a Q&A session today.”

Asian markets react to Fed interest rates data - It's not good

Global markets experienced volatility during Thursday’s trading session as U.S. stocks closed with a mixed performance due to the Federal Reserve’s decision to postpone interest rate cuts. Any optimism for a string of interest rate reductions in 2024 has quickly faded as the economy and inflation show unexpected resilience.U.S. shares were poised for an upward trajectory, with the futures for the S&P 500 showing a strong surge of 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures indicating a 0.4% increase.Markets all over the world react to Fed ratesEuropean markets started the day with a mix of gains and losses, as investors braced themselves for a flurry of corporate earnings announcements. In early trading, London’s FTSE 100 rose by 0.4% to reach 8,155.28. Germany’s DAX saw a slight decrease of less than 0.1% to 17,925.06, while the CAC 40 in Paris experienced a 0.7% decline to 7,926.97.The Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo experienced a slight decline of 0.1% and ended the day at 38,236.07. As per the announcement yesterday, the Committee aims to attain full employment and maintain a stable inflation rate of 2 percent in the long term. Additionally, the Fed Committee believes that the risks of achieving its employment and inflation goals have become more balanced over the past year. The economic outlook is filled with uncertainty, and the Committee is closely monitoring inflation risks. The Fed added that:In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
 FedMarkets in AsiaThe Japanese yen experienced a significant surge of up to 2% during the early hours of Asia on Thursday. This surge was fueled by speculation surrounding the possibility of Japanese authorities engaging in another round of yen-buying intervention. Additionally, the weakening of the U.S. dollar following the Federal Reserve meeting also contributed to this surge. Afterwards, the yen changed direction and nullified its earlier gains. The dollar had risen to 155.44 yen, compared to its previous rate of 154.91 yen.The Kospi in South Korea experienced a 0.3% decline, settling at 2,683.65. This drop came after the release of official data indicating a 2.9% year-on-year increase in consumer prices for April, which was a slower rate compared to March.The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong saw a 2.4% increase, reaching 18,187.56. Several markets in China were closed for the Labor Day holiday. Meanwhile, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 saw a modest 0.2% increase, reaching 7,587.00.On Wednesday, the S&P 500 experienced a 0.3% decline, closing at 5,018.39. This drop came after the Federal Reserve decided to maintain its main interest rate at its highest level since 2001, which was in line with market expectations. The index experienced a significant rally of 1.2% during the afternoon, only to relinquish all of its gains by the end of the trading session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 0.2% to reach 37,903.29, while the Nasdaq composite experienced a 0.3% decline, closing at 15,605.48.Asian crypto markets’ performanceIn recent months, inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2% objective, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pointed out. This has caused stock prices to decline and dashed traders’ hopes for imminent cuts in interest rates. He also mentioned that it may take more time than initially anticipated to gain enough confidence to reduce interest rates. This action would help alleviate the strain on the economy and stabilize investment prices.The price of bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a modest rebound in the minutes following the news, although it continues to face downward pressure. It is currently down over 4% for the session, trading at $58,000.Furthermore, alongside the rate news, the FOMC revealed its decision to decrease the reduction of Treasuries held on its balance sheet, known as quantitative tightening (QT), from $60 billion per month to a more modest $25 billion per month. Assuming all other factors remain constant, the move is expected to increase risk appetite and drive up asset prices.

89% of Holders of Gary Gensler’s Praised Token in Loss, Just 8% See Profits - Coin Edition


							

Algorand holders face significant losses, with a staggering 89% underwater.



Only 8% of investors in ALGO are currently in profit at its price of $0.1818.



Gary Gensler previously praised Algorand, helping the asset reach $3.56 ATH.




As the crypto market experiences a downturn, crypto investors feel the heat, particularly those holding Algorand (ALGO), Gary Gensler’s praised project. Data from the analytics platform IntoTheBlock shows that 89% of ALGO holders are at a loss. These investors are “out of the money,” meaning the overwhelming majority of ALGO investors hold the asset below the price they first bought them. 



ALGO trades at $0.1818 at press time, with a 5% gain in the last 24 hours. At this market value, only 8% of Algorand holders are profitable. In parallel, 3% are at break even, neither bearish making profit or gains.



Source: IntoTheBlock



Remarkably, among the cryptocurrencies monitored by IntoTheBlock, ALGO stands out as having the highest percentage of holders in a loss position.



Furthermore, IntoTheBlock statistics indicated that at least 83% of these Algorand investors are long-term investors holding the asset for more than a year. Only 15% joined the ALGO market within the last year. Meanwhile, 2% of the holder spectrum accounts for those who bought ALGO within the last 30 days.



Silvio Micali, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor, founded Algorand in 2017. This blockchain project garnered praise from the now infamous U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, Gary Gensler. 









This was during Gensler’s tenure teaching at the MIT Sloan School of Management in 2018 and 2019. Specifically, during a 2019 presentation, Gensler remarked that Algorand is “a great technology that has a performance with which you could create Uber on top of it.”



This endorsement gained more significance after Gensler assumed the role of SEC Chair in 2021. However, when the SEC filed a lawsuit against the crypto trading platform Bittrex last April, it classified ALGO as a security. 



Despite initial optimism and endorsements, Algorand has struggled to keep pace with its peers in recent years. Three months after Gensler’s 2019 presentation, ALGO surged to an all-time high of $3.56. However, selling at around $0.1818, the asset reflects a staggering 94% drop in value since then.

BONK at risk? Funding rates suggest this about memecoin's price - AMBCrypto



BONK’s funding rates have been mostly negative since the 13th of April.
Its price may decline further if bearish momentum climbs.

The recent decline in Bonk’s [BONK] value has been accompanied by negative funding rates in the meme coin‘s futures market, according to data from Coinglass.
Funding rates are a mechanism used in perpetual futures contracts to ensure the contract price stays close to the spot price. 
When an asset’s futures funding rates turn negative, it suggests a strong demand for short positions. This is considered a bearish signal and a precursor to an asset’s price decline. 
According to Coinglass data, BONK’s funding rate across crypto exchanges has been predominantly negative since the 13th of April.  
Source: Coinglass
As of this writing, it was -0.0068%. This value shows that there are more traders in BONK’s futures market expecting its price to fall than traders buying the memecoin with the expectation of selling at a higher price.
A look at its futures open interest revealed a similar pattern of decline since 26th April. At press time, the memecoin’s futures open interest was $6 million, having declined by 33% in the last week.
An asset’s futures open interest refers to the total number of its futures contracts that have yet to be settled or closed. When it declines in this manner, it indicates an increase in the number of market participants exiting their positions without opening ones.
 It is also regarded as a bearish signal.
What BONK might do next?
BONK witnessed a brief price rally between the 20th and 25th of April, which caused its price to rise above support. 
By 25th April, the memecoin’s rally hit a snag as it could not break above resistance at $0.000029. After that, it trended downward to retest support. 
However, due to the spike in bearish momentum, BONK broke below support to close at $0.000018 on 1st May.
Source: BONK/USDT on TradingView
If bear power continues to climb, the meme coin may experience a further decline to exchange hands at $0.000015. Should the bulls fail to regain control at this point, BONK’s price may slide further downward, forcing the memecoin to trade at $0.000012.
However, if bullish momentum spikes, the coin may retest support and rally toward reclaiming resistance at $0.000029.

Shiba Inu Flashes Bull Flag, Why A 150% Price Jump Is Imminent | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu (SHIB) could soon witness a significant price rally, with crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighting a bullish pattern forming on the meme coin’s chart. Shiba Inu’s price could potentially see a 150% gain when this rally happens. 
A Bull Flag Is Forming On SHIB’s Chart
Martinez mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Shiba Inu looks to be forming a bull flag on its daily chart. A bull flag is a bullish pattern that indicates that the crypto asset will soon see further moves to the upside. In anticipation of this move, the crypto analyst further revealed that he was placing a buy order around $0.000018343, aiming for a bullish breakout that would send Shiba Inu’s price to $0.000072323. 


Source: X

Seeing that a rise to that price level represents about a 150% price gain for the meme coin, some of Martinez’s followers seemed skeptical about the prediction, with some jokingly asking the crypto analyst if his account was hacked again. Interestingly, this prediction is far from ambitious, considering that Martinez previously predicted that the meme coin could eventually rise to $0.011. 
Meanwhile, those looking to jump on Martinez’s trade idea could also adopt Crypto analyst Crypto Noan’s profit-taking strategy if Shiba Inu doesn’t get to $0.000072323 as Martinez predicts. Noan highlighted four price levels at which SHIB investors should consider taking profit as the meme coin moves to the upside. 
These price levels are $0.000028181, $0.000032816, $0.000039035, and $0.000043609. That means that all Noan’s take profit-targets will be filled on Shiba Inu’s potential rise to $0.000072323. Therefore, investors might want to consider securing some profits along the way
Shiba Inu Could Indeed Hit $0.000072323 Soon
Shiba Inu rising to $0.00072323 looks like a real possibility, considering that crypto analyst and trader Xanrox hinted that the meme coin would rise to as high as $0.00008854 by July. Xanrox also predicted that Shiba Inu will record a 300% price gain before the end of this year. Therefore, a 150% move from its current price level could easily be attained. 

Moreover, other crypto analysts like Javon Marks have predicted that SHIB could shed another zero and rise to as high as $0.0001553 in this bull run. Shiba already announced its intention to be one of the best-performing assets in this cycle, with a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 100%.    
At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00002196, up over 3% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin Slump Pushes New Whales Underwater: A Rare Opportunity To Buy?


                            As Bitcoin slumps, on-chain data by Ki Young Ju, the founder of the blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, paints a stark picture: all new whales, including holders of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are now underwater. 
New Whales And Spot ETF Investors Are In Red
Taking to X, Ju said that more losses would be incoming, predicting that HODLers will find “max pain” at around $51,000. The dip is less than $10,000 from spot rates, suggesting that although there are cracks, the correction might not be deep. 

This overview is welcomed, considering the recent sell-off. Even so, predicting price bottoms in a fast-moving market influenced by multiple forces is tough.

As price action stands, Ju says believers may take the opportunity to double down on the coin. The founder adds that the current price discount presents an opportunity for savvy investors to outperform traditional finance whales, including institutions with BTC exposure via spot ETFs in the United States.

Bitcoin is under immense liquidation pressure at the time of this writing. Though bulls soaked up the sell-off earlier today, the coin remains within a bearish breakout. Prices are trading below the support zone of between $60,000 and $61,000 and below April 2024.
Inflow To Spot Bitcoin ETFs Decline As Sentiment Deteriorate
This formation suggests that though bulls are optimistic, the path of least resistance remains southwards for now. BTC dropped after posting impressive returns from October 2023 to March 2024, when prices peaked. Some analysts think the current cool-off is inevitable following sharp gains in the last six months.
The fact that whales are underwater was unexpected, considering the state of affairs in the last week of April. Then, the inflow from new whales nearly doubled the cumulative holdings of older whales. Analysts said this influx of fresh capital pointed to growing institutional interest. 
However, looking at the current price action, new whales are now in the red territory, and their excitement seems to wane. 

According to Lookonchain data, inflow into the eight-spot Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock, has stalled. On May 1, all issuers, including Grayscale via GBTC, decreased by 1,950 BTC. Of note is that BlackRock’s IBIT has not seen inflows for five straight days.

Still, confidence abounds. Inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs are highly influenced by sentiment, which rests on how prices perform. If BTC shakes off the current weakness and tears higher in the expected post-Halving rally, spot ETF issuers will begin receiving new inflows.

XRP to Replace the Dollar? Crypto Pundit Predicts Major Role for Ripple's XRP Ledger in Japan ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Cryptocurrency commentator Jack Straw has ignited a debate with his assertion that XRP could potentially replace the US dollar in Japan. This bold statement comes as Ripple, in collaboration with HashKey DX, makes strides in introducing XRP Ledger-based solutions to the Japanese market.



The partnership aims to offer supply chain finance solutions powered by the XRPL blockchain, with the backing of Japanese financial giant SBI Group. If Jack Straw’s prediction holds, this move could significantly impact Japan’s financial landscape and potentially revolutionize cross-border trade.







Ripple’s Strategic Move into the Japanese Market



Ripple’s partnership with HashKey DX marks a strategic move to tap into Japan’s supply chain finance market, which is experiencing rapid growth. A recent research report suggests that blockchain’s role in supply chain finance is set to surge from $360 million to $13.4 billion by 2030.



With the introduction of HashKey DX’s supply chain finance product, which is already successful in China with over $7 billion in trade volume, Ripple aims to replicate this success in Japan. This initiative aligns with Ripple’s broader goal of promoting the adoption of the XRP Ledger and strengthening its position in the global financial ecosystem.



Jack Straw’s assertion that XRP could replace the US dollar in Japan hinges on several key factors. He argues that Japan has already begun adopting XRPL-based solutions, citing SBI Group’s introduction of an XRP-based cross-border payment service last September.

&nbsp



According to Straw, this move signals Japan’s willingness to explore alternatives to traditional banking systems. He further speculates that XRP could be a liquidity source to replace the dollar in Japan’s currency exchange operations, potentially reducing its reliance on the SWIFT network.



Implications for Japan’s Economy and Global Trade



If XRP were to replace the US dollar in Japan’s currency exchange, it could have significant implications for the country’s economy and global trade relationships.



Jack Straw believes this shift would accelerate Japan’s de-dollarization process, leading to the country selling off its dollar reserves in favor of other assets like gold. Additionally, introducing an XRP stablecoin could facilitate the digital movement of funds, further reducing Japan’s dependence on traditional banking systems.



While speculative, Jack Straw’s prediction raises intriguing possibilities for the future of Japan’s economic landscape. If Ripple’s initiatives gain traction in the Japanese market, we could witness a significant shift in how the country conducts its monetary operations.



Michael Saylor Urges Japan to Adopt Bitcoin



Amid the Japanese Yen’s plunge to its lowest value against the USD in 34 years, social media is buzzing with a growing discussion about Bitcoin as a more stable alternative to fiat currency.



This discussion has gained traction, with prominent Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor highlighting Bitcoin’s potential to offer a ray of hope to Japan in the face of its currency challenges.

Bitcoin Transactions Plummet Following Absurd Runes and Halving Surge - Decrypt

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe price of Bitcoin may have taken a hit as of late—but at least you can again make payments using the coin with relative ease. Transaction fees for Bitcoin are now back to the lows it stood at last month. The average cost for a transaction is $4.50 as of this writing, according to BitInfoCharts.Following the quadrennial halving event last month, the cost to send Bitcoin hit a record high of $128 per transaction as the network became clogged with activity following the concurrent launch of Runes, a new standard for creating tokens on the blockchain.The flurry of activity on Bitcoin’s network often made the transaction fee more expensive than the amount of money being sent, Decrypt found.Bitcoin transaction fees go up when more people use the network because they are part of the way transactions are prioritized. Everyone wants their payment to be processed as quickly as possible, given the notorious volatility of BTC.If the network is busy, more users will pay a premium for miners to prioritize validating their transactions. When making a Bitcoin payment, you always have the option of paying lower fees, but by doing so, you risk waiting for hours as miners prioritize more lucrative transactions.Bitcoin miners are increasingly large operations—usually operating warehouses full of computers—that work to mint Bitcoin and process transactions. They are rewarded for each block they process on the network, but that reward was slashed in half in the halving.In order to remain profitable, mining operations need to become more efficient. But in the meantime, higher fees certainly helped.Bitcoin touched a new all-time high of $73,737 last month but stands at $59,248 as of writing, a drop of nearly 20%, according to CoinGecko.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

BlackRock expects spot Bitcoin trading by sovereign funds and pensions |

Bitcoin’s current standing near $60,000 marks a 50% jump since January, a spike largely fueled by the U.S.’s green light on its first spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock, a key player in these ETFs, has caught the attention of big-money investors like sovereign wealth funds, which are getting ready to enter the trading scene in the months ahead.Market Dynamics and Investor InterestBlackRock’s Robert Mitchnick, Head of Bitcoin and Crypto Strategies, recently shared that a diverse group of financial institutions is keen on Bitcoin. This includes pensions, endowments, insurers, other asset managers, and family offices.The company is seeing these firms engage in thorough research and ongoing discussions about Bitcoin. They are contributing by educating them on the crypto industry, Mitchnick told Coindesk. This surge in interest marks a resurgence in Bitcoin discussions, suggesting a strategic shift in how these institutions view portfolio construction with Bitcoin in mind.Despite a temporary slowdown in money moving into spot Bitcoin ETFs after an impressive 71-day run of inflows, Mitchnick believes this is just the calm before a new influx of investment from these heavyweight financial entities.According to him, the anticipation around these ETFs has been building, with over $76 billion already pouring into these products since their inception in January. While currently, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF is offered on an unsolicited basis by some RIAs, plans are on the table to expand access through major wealth advisors like Morgan Stanley.BlackRock’s ETF Performance and Industry TrendsThe race to dominate the ETF market has been a hot topic, especially between BlackRock’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC. The latest data shows IBIT managing assets worth $17.2 billion, while GBTC has about $24.3 billion. A significant portion of IBIT’s funds comes from transfers from Grayscale, with additional inflows from pricier international ETFs and those converting from Bitcoin futures.The shift from futures to spot products indicates a preference among investors to hold Bitcoin directly through more regulated, traditional financial systems, avoiding the complexities of custody and tax implications tied to exchanges. Despite the fierce competition, Mitchnick points out that BlackRock’s focus isn’t on outpacing Grayscale but on equipping their clients with the knowledge to navigate the crypto space effectively.Wednesday brought a stark change, with record outflows from all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs—a first since these funds were established. The downturn saw $563.7 million withdrawn in a single day, culminating in a four-week loss of about $6 billion, a 20% decrease in assets under management.Even BlackRock’s flagship IBIT wasn’t spared, witnessing its first outflows of $36.9 million. The declines in Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC were even steeper, with losses tallying $191.1 million and $167.4 million, respectively.This trend correlates directly with Bitcoin’s price movements. After peaking at an all-time high of $73,000 in March, Bitcoin has since dropped nearly 20%, settling around $59,000. This price drop and the resultant ETF outflows began around the same time, underscoring the challenges and volatility inherent in the crypto market.

Hong Kong Bankers' Guide to the Middle East - Coin Edition


							

Interest among Hong Kong bankers in Middle East opportunities grows.
Bahrain-based Investcorp Holdings recently unveiled plans to launch a $1 billion fund.
The favorable tax environment in the Middle East, with zero income tax, contrasts Hong Kong’s 16% maximum rate, 




Hong Kong bankers are increasingly eyeing opportunities in the Middle East as interest in Asia’s self-acclaimed “World City” increases. This trend is marked by notable developments like the upcoming market forum co-hosted by the Hong Kong Exchange and its Saudi Arabian counterpart. As revealed by Bloomberg, this partnership signals the emerging collaboration between the two regions. 



Moreover, Bahrain-based Investcorp Holdings recently unveiled plans to launch a $1 billion fund. This initiative targets Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, further highlighting increased cross-regional investment strategies.



Bloomberg’s insights noted that the Middle East’s favorable tax environment is a significant catalyst for growing interest as the region’s “zero” income tax starkly contrasts Hong Kong’s 16% maximum rate. 



This factor, coupled with the substantial wealth of Gulf countries, promises appealing prospects for financial professionals seeking tax-efficient opportunities. “Countries in the Middle East are so wealthy that four of the world’s top 10 sovereign wealth funds are from the Gulf—those in Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. So read their lips: They don’t need your taxes,” Bloomberg stated.



However, individuals pointed out lifestyle adjustments such as increased “housing cost” and little reliance on public transportation in the region. Although accommodations in the Middle East are more spacious, sources expressed that Hong Kong offers a more efficient public transit system and unique natural landscapes away from the city center.



Moreover, people stressed the varying alcohol regulations across Gulf cities. While Dubai and Abu Dhabi offer relatively liberal access to alcohol, cities like Riyadh have strict prohibitions. This highlights the importance of understanding cultural norms and regulations in prospective relocation destinations.



Furthermore, for individuals seeking halal dietary requirements, the Middle East offers an array of such restaurants, including “Non-Muslim Only” supermarkets. Given these, financial experts considering relocation should examine factors such as taxation, lifestyle preferences, and cultural nuances before deciding.

With a tiny amount of hWBTC, they managed to drain Hundred Finance’s lending pools. The exploit was analyzed as a combination of flash loans, critical rounding error, and smart contract manipulation.The movement of funds from the Hundred Finance attack mirrors a recent report on a similar incident. Earlier this week, CryptoNews reported that the attacker behind the Poloniex security breach had transferred the funds after months of dormancy.The hacker stole assets worth $33M from the exchange in 2023. A few days ago, they transferred 501 BTC (approximately $32M) to three new wallet addresses to hide the assets’ origin.Crackdown on Crypto Mixer Adds Pressure on Cybercriminals
Many analysts believe it might be difficult for the Hundred Finance hacker to conceal the asset’s origin or convert it to fiat without a trace.To succeed in any of these, the perpetrator has to break the traceability chain that links the funds to the hacked wallet before cashing it out – which is a tall order, as it seems. Typically, crypto mixer services like Samourai Wallet or Tornado Cash – where his exploit originated – would have provided a convenient cover to launder the funds. However, with US regulators breathing down their necks, these services are no longer a viable option for criminals.Last week, the creators of Samourai Wallet founders were arrested and charged by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) over the alleged laundering of $100 million from an illicit market and helping criminals to launder $1.7B.This comes after Tornado Cash’s co-founders, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, were indicted for allegedly enabling more than $1 billion in money laundering through their platform.Meanwhile, global regulators are tightening the screws on crypto users who hide their transaction histories. The European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers on April 24, 2024, as part of new anti-money laundering regulations.

Elizabeth Warren's Latest Crypto Crusade: Bitcoin Mining In Iran - Decrypt

U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is sounding yet another alarm about the ills of cryptocurrency; this time focused on cryptocurrency mining operations in Iran that she claims are financing Hamas and other terrorist groups around the world.In an open letter to the Biden Administration—co-signed by Sen. Angus King—Warren asked the secretaries of Defense and Treasury as well as the White House National Security Advisor about the administration’s efforts to “combat Iran’s rampant evasion of U.S. and international sanctions through cryptocurrency (crypto) mining.”“Iran legalized the crypto mining industry in 2019,” Warren and King wrote. “In the five years since Iran has raised millions of dollars through mining crypto… a steady revenue source that allows it to purchase imports, move funds domestically and internationally, and fund Hamas and other terrorist organizations.“This ongoing activity by the Iranian government threatens our national security,” the senators warn.“Mining for energy-intensive blockchains like Bitcoin can allow countries to monetize energy resources, some of which cannot be exported due to sanctions,” the letter continued, citing an April 2022 International Monetary Fund (IMF) report.Warren and King also mentioned a February 2024 Chainalysis report. “More than three percent of all inflows to Iranian crypto exchanges—and more than 29% of all Bitcoin inflows—are estimated to come from mining pools,” they wrote.Warren and King enumerated several questions for the Biden Administration to answer regarding Iran's cryptocurrency activities. How much revenue has Iranian crypto miners generated since 2021? What share is collected by the government or its affiliates? And to what extent do these funds support terrorism or military activities?The Senators also want to know what the administration has been doing to address the national security threats posed by Iran's alleged sanction-evading crypto activity.“Unless we take action, Iran will continue to use crypto to fund attacks against Israel,” the senators said.The letter to the White House is the latest salvo from Warren in her ongoing campaign to fight the use of cryptocurrency in illicit activities.In December, Warren called for the Bank Secrecy Act to be updated to address the “threat” of crypto, claiming that North Korea is using cryptocurrency to fund its nuclear weapons program. Then in April, Warren asked the U.S. Department of Justice and Homeland Security to respond to questions on how Congress can help them fight Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) funded with cryptocurrency.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

What Fetch.ai (FET) Price Needs for a 25% Bull Rally


Following the broader market cues, Fetch.ai’s (FET) price fell below the support of $2, but it is likely on the verge of bouncing back. 
This is because the altcoin is in an ideal spot for accumulation, indicating potential gains going forward.
Fetch.ai Is Undervalued
Fetch.ai’s price could observe a recovery, given the altcoin is trading above a key support level. Currently, the altcoin is noting a surge in participation. This is evident in the increase in active addresses in the last 48 hours. 
The total number of investors conducting transactions on the network rose from 1,152 to 2,152, marking a 93% increase. While this could be interpreted as FET holders attempting to sell to minimize their losses, the larger picture is bullish.

An increase in participation combined with a decrease in price is usually considered a buy signal. This divergence created by the daily active addresses and price suggests increased supply and lower demand, making it an ideal buy zone.

Furthermore, FET is highly undervalued at the moment, which makes it an attractive investment. This can be noted using the Sharpe Ratio. 
This indicator measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment, considering its volatility. It helps investors assess the return generated per unit of risk taken, providing insight into the efficiency of an investment in generating returns relative to its risk.
Given that Fetch.ai’s Sharpe ratio is bouncing back from a six-month low, it has considerable room for growth.
Read More: How Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) Transform Crypto?

Fetch.ai Sharpe Ratio. Source: Messari
FET Price Prediction: Gains Ahead
Fetch.ai’s price, trading at $1.95 at the time of writing, is just under the support line formed at $1.96. This support level has been tested multiple times in the past and has not yet been broken down. Considerable gains have followed a bounce back from this support.
Thus, the likely outcome for FET is a rally towards $2.46. This resistance was tested in the last run-up from $1.96 and would mark a 25% rally for Fetch.ai price, provided it successfully breached the $2.26 barrier.

On the other hand, if Fetch.ai’s price falls through the support at $1.96, it could escape the consolidation. In doing so, the bullish thesis will be invalidated, and FET could fall to $1.71.

No, Elon Musk Is Not Testing XRP Payments


Vet, a validator on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has shut down rumors about Elon Musk's X social media network testing XRP payments. The rumor was based on the fact that a transaction with the "Musk" label was recently spotted on the network. However, as noted by Vet, there is no authorization needed from the famous entrepreneur for labeling this account. "I can label my account to be by Musk or JPM as well. No proof needed," he added. X is actually expected to launch peer-to-peer payments this year. However, it is not clear whether Musk's social network will actually support cryptocurrencies. In any case, Dogecoin appears to be the likeliest contender, so the idea of XRP being used for payments on X appears to be extremely far-fetched. A fix is coming There is an amendment that is supposed to add Decentralized Identifier (DID) functionality to the ledger. According to Vet, it will solve the impersonalization issue. cardThe amendment, which was developed in accordance with standards and guidelines for the World Wide Web, will be able to provide users with their own digital identity that will not be dependent on any centralized authority. On top of being decentralized, DIDs are also cryptographically verifiable, meaning that they are tamper-evident.  An account holder will be able to generate a DID that will be used for signing digital documents, making transactions, and logging into websites The identity of an XRPL user would be verified with the help of a DID document that could contain cryptographic public keys. Only those who control private keys can change the content of the document. Users are advised against uploading personal information in these documents.

US lawmakers urge SEC to approve Bitcoin options trading

United States lawmakers are reportedly pressing the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve options trading on Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs). According to a report by Axios, Representatives Mike Flood and Wiley Nickel recently wrote a letter to the Commission’s chair, Gary Gensler, urging the SEC to stop discriminating against crypto funds."We urge you, without delay, to approve options on spot Bitcoin ETPs or to provide an explanation for the Commission’s difference in treatment between options for Bitcoin futures ETFs — which are currently trading — and options for the spot Bitcoin ETPs,” reads the bipartisan letter. Options are financial instruments that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset — in this case, Bitcoin — at a fixed price by a certain date. The instrument is commonly used for hedging against price movements, limiting potential losses and enabling investors to generate additional income through strategies. The approval, according to Flood and Nickel, is crucial for the investors that the SEC "seeks to protect."The agency has been holding off on decisions on applications from the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets submitted in January. Nasdaq filed to list and trade options on BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, while Cboe intends to offer options trading on various BTC funds. Similarly, the NYSE intends to trade options on Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Grayscale Bitcoin Trusts (GBTC) and any other trusts holding Bitcoin.Recently, the Commission initiated a new consultation round on the proposed rule change to permit options trading on Bitcoin funds.

Time to Buy SHIB? Popular Analyst Bets on a 300% Shiba Inu Price Rally


																TL;DR

Shiba Inu experienced a 5% price increase daily, with optimistic forecasts from analysts like Ali Martinez, who predicts a significant upcoming rally due to positive chart patterns.
The potential for an uptick is supported by a significant resurgence in SHIB’s burning program and ongoing enhancements to Shibarium.


Betting on a SHIB Bull Run
The cryptocurrency market flashed green today (May 2) after suffering substantial losses the previous day. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is among the best performers (at least from the top 20 club), registering a 5% price increase on a 24-hour scale.

SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko
One analyst who is optimistic that the meme coin is yet to experience a significant rally is Ali Martinez. The X user believes SHIB’s price trajectory might be forming a bull flag on the daily chart.
Ali Martinez went further, admitting to placing buy orders at current rates and expecting a 300% surge to approximately $0.000072323 in the near future.
Other analysts who recently envisioned a bright future for the meme coin include Rekt Capital and crypto content creator Jake Gagain. The former forecasted a triple-digit price increase, while the latter maintained that “fading” Shiba Inu “is a major mistake.” 




The Contributing Factors
Two essential elements that may fuel a SHIB rally in the short term are the asset’s burning program and the development of Shibarium.
As CryptoPotato reported, the burn rate spiked by 90% on May 1, whereas the destroyed tokens throughout April equaled almost 1.7 billion. The mechanism’s ultimate goal is to decrease the tremendous circulating supply of Shiba Inu, making it scarcer and possibly more valuable in time.
Shibarium has been making great strides, too. The asset’s layer-2 scaling solution underwent a major upgrade last week and is set to pass through another one this week. The advancements aim at improving user experience, implement quicker block processing times, and empower the community of developers and innovators.
Some of the primary roles of Shibarium include the reduction of transaction fees and enhancing the utility, scalability, and efficiency of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. If you are willing to learn more about the network, feel free to dive into our dedicated video below:

Analysts expect Bitcoin price recovery after Fed leaves rates unchanged

Bitcoin (BTC) price recovered on May 2 after the United States Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged and dampened investors’ hope for rate cuts in 2024. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes released on May 1, the Fed said interest rates would stay at 5.25%–5.50%, adding that it would need “greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%” before cutting rates.The Fed also revealed plans to slow the pace of its balance sheet reductions – the so-called quantitative tightening (QT) – from $60 billion per month to just $25 billion per month. “Beginning in June, the Committee will slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings by reducing the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $60 billion to $25 billion.”Market analyst and X user Fejau said the FOMC press release sent mixed signals, being dovish on the balance sheet and hawkish on rate cuts.

As Crypto Prices and Sentiment Fall, One Analyst Says Bitcoin’s Back Slide Is Almost Over - The Daily Hodl


								After a week of falling prices for crypto led by Bitcoin (BTC), a widely-followed analyst says the bottom is nearly in.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe warns his 715,600 followers on the social media platform X that it could still take some time for BTC to recover from falling nearly 7% in the last two weeks.










“It’s going to take a while for Bitcoin.
However, most of the downside is done. 
There might be another 5-10% correction, but from here, altcoins are going to take over until Bitcoin breaks the all-time high.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
BTC is worth $59,290 at time of writing, up 4% in the last 24 hours.
Pulling back the curtain on altcoins, Van de Poppe says this slump should be expected after the long hibernation of a bear market.
“Sentiment is on the ground, retail isn’t here and the expectations are that the markets will solely continue to fall down. 
That’s entirely expected after the longest bear market for altcoins, which has been taking place for 2.5-3 years.”
Looking specifically at the Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 altcoin Optimism (OP), the analyst remains optimistic about the token’s future.
“One of the strongest performers since the last low; OP.
It’s up more than 50% already.
Expecting to continue running in the coming period, every 20-30% dip is an opportunity to scoop some more.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
OP is worth $2.77 at time of writing, up 9% on the day.
Focusing on the leading altcoin by market cap Ethereum, the crypto analyst thinks ETH could drop to $2,500 before rallying.
“Ethereum might be dropping to the $2,500 area for the most optimal play.
Personally, I don’t think the markets are going to be having such a heavy correction. 
Most of the downside is already in.”

ETH is trading for $2,997 at time of writing, up 4% since yesterday.

Ripple Ramps Up Effort to Strike SEC's Expert Materials


San Francisco-based company Ripple has filed a new letter to bolster its motion to strike the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's expert materials. As reported by U.Today, Ripple moved to strike the expert materials from Andrea Fox, an assistant chief accountant in the regulator's Division of EnforcementIts key argument against the SEC hinged on the untimely disclosure. The defendant said that the regulator was supposed to disclose its expert witness before the final stage of the discovery. Ripple took issue with the fact that Fox was not disclosed as an expert witness. Instead, she was described as a summary witness by the SEC. In its most recent filing, Ripple says that the SEC has no good explanation as to why Fox's declaration touts her as an accountant if she is not testifying as an expert. Ripple asserts that Fox did "much more" than simply copying, pasting, and adding numbers. Furthermore, it says that the SEC's cases do not support the agency's characterization of a summary witness. "Even if Fox were a summary witness, rather an expert, the parties' agreement and the Court's scheduling order required the SEC to disclose her before the close of discovery."In April, Ripple also filed its opposition to the SEC's motion for remedies, arguing that the civil penalty should be reduced to a puny $10 million. Meanwhile, the SEC argued that Ripple had to fork out a whopping $2 billion.The SEC originally took Ripple to court all the way back in December 2020. Last July, the company scored a partial victory, with XRP gaining regulatory clarity in the US. Despite this win, the token has significantly underperformed Bitcoin.

MicroStrategy Takes on Worldcoin ID with Bitcoin Inscriptions - DailyCoin


        
MicroStrategy introduces a decentralized ID system.



Anchors digital identities on Bitcoin’s blockchain.



Challenges Worldcoin and its World. 
Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy is betting big on Bitcoin. Known for its strong Bitcoin maximalist position and large BTC holdings, MicroStrategy is now expanding into a new arena. With its digital identity protocol launch, the firm is creating its own digital identity system, potentially challenging Worldcoin’s World ID system. The goal is to centralize the Bitcoin blockchain to a new digital identity system. Why Digital Identities Are Key for BlockchainDuring the recent MicroStrategy World Conference on Thursday, May 2, Michael Saylor pointed out the need to manage digital identity on the blockchain. He also unveiled a new MicroStrategy Orange protocol, which will use Bitcoin’s inscription technology to create a digital identity system. 
Digital identity has been a contentious issue in crypto due to privacy concerns. However, crypto insides are increasingly converging around the need for such a technology to combat spam and enable decentralized governance. Moreover, the digital ID system could prevent scams. In January, Saylor warned about the staggering rise of AI deepfakes plaguing the crypto space. The scams use realistic videos, including those of himself and figures like Elon Musk, to convince people to send crypto to unaffiliated wallets. So far, Worldcoin, co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, has been the biggest player in the digital identity space. Its orb-scanning technology uses biometric data to verify that users are real humans. This enables it to give priority to real human transactions, reducing the problems with blockchain spam. Now, Saylor seeks to bring these digital IDs to Bitcoin, which is, as he often points out, the most secure and decentralized network. How MicroStrategy’s Digital Identity Will WorkUnlike Worldcoin, MicroStrategy’s new Orange Protocol will not use biometric data. Instead, it will create decentralized identities (DIDs) that can be used for verification without centralized control. The protocol will generate and embed digital identity data directly into the Bitcoin blockchain using the technology known as ordinal inscriptions. 
These inscriptions are not part of the transaction outputs but are appended in a way that does not affect the transaction’s primary purpose (transferring Bitcoin). As such, they did: the method embeds digital identity data directly into the Bitcoin blockchain using a part of the transaction known as the “witness.” Bitcoin’s Segregated Witness (SegWit) method optimizes the space and cost of transactions. By inscribing identity data into this section, the method ensures that identity information is secure and immutable, benefiting from the blockchain’s inherent resistance to tampering and revision.On the Flipside
Unlike Worldcoin, MicroStrategy’s digital ID will not directly provide proof of personhood based on biometric data. Instead, it will leverage the immutability of Bitcoin’s blockchain to create digital identity profiles.



In April, Telegram’s TON introduced its own blockchain digital ID system based on palm prints. 
Why This MattersMicroStrategy’s venture into decentralized digital identities using Bitcoin’s blockchain could offer a secure and immutable alternative to biometric-based systems like Worldcoin. This approach broadens Bitcoin’s application to include vital identity verification processes in the blockchain ecosystem. Read more about why Bitcoin needs a digital ID system: Michael Saylor Sounds the Alarm on Bitcoin Scam EpidemicRead more about Tether’s reserves and where their profits come from: Tether Reports Record Profits: Breaking Down USDT Reserves

US lawmakers warn of Iranian crypto miners threatening national security

United States Senators Elizabeth Warren and Angus King penned a letter to officials warning of potential national security threats posed by cryptocurrency miners in Iran.In a May 1 letter to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the two lawmakers called on the Biden administration to provide information related to possible ties between the Iranian government and local crypto miners and how digital assets might be used to bypass U.S. sanctions. According to Senators Warren and King, Iran has used funds from crypto mining to fund terrorist organizations and the country’s April attack on Israel.“Iran’s use of crypto to evade sanctions poses a direct threat to our national security,” said the letter. “The Iranian military has used crypto to fund known terrorist groups like Hezbollah, the organization believed to be partially responsible for the January 2024 drone strike in Jordan that killed three U.S. service members [...] Unless we take action, Iran will continue to use crypto to fund attacks against Israel.”Source: The HillSenators Warren and King requested U.S. officials provide data on the revenue of crypto miners in Iran, how it is potentially used for money laundering and its response to “address threats to U.S. national security.” The two cited a report from an Iranian think tank saying the government preferred “newly-minted” Bitcoin (BTC), claiming they were “less traceable.” Reports suggested Iranian BTC miners could have produced up to $1 billion in revenue in 2021. Related: Crypto users fooled by fake Elizabeth Warren letter proposing crypto taxIran has been under various sanctions the United States and international authorities imposed since 1979. Iranian officials previously cracked down on crypto mining in the country, citing concerns about electricity use, but the government legalized the practice in 2019. Senator Warren continues to be one of the most outspoken anti-crypto voices in the U.S. government, associating the technology with illicit drug trafficking, terrorism and harmful effects on the economy. She is up for reelection in November and will likely face off against Republican candidate and crypto lawyer John Deaton for her Massachusetts Senate seat.Magazine: Lawmakers’ fear and doubt drives proposed crypto regulations in US

This purchase, as detailed in a 13F filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 1st, saw the bank acquire 1,030 IBIT shares at over $40 per share, totaling $42,684.Market MovesWhile this price per share seems small compared to Bitcoin’s trading price of over $58,000, it is a major investment by BNP Paribas into the cryptocurrency market, particularly into a fund that has quickly become the most successful of the newly approved Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. With this purchase, BNP Paribas is tapping into the success of BlackRock’s IBIT, a fund that leads with $17.24 billion in assets under management despite recent market fluctuations.This acquisition not only marks BNP Paribas as the first major financial institution to get into such a venture but also demonstrates a growing institutional interest in Bitcoin and related investment offerings. The filing reveals that the transaction was part of a broader trend where major traditional financial players begin to engage more deeply with digital assets.Challenges in the Crypto MarketHowever, the cryptocurrency market has seen a lot of volatility. Recent data from CoinGlass indicates that all 10 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced outflows for the first time this Wednesday, marking the most substantial loss since these funds began trading in January. Over the last four weeks, these funds have seen about $6 billion wiped off their books, a reduction of around 20% in assets under management.Source: NasdaqBlackRock’s IBIT saw $36.9 million in outflows, its first such event since inception. The other major funds, Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC, reported losses of $191.1 million and $167.4 million, respectively. This downturn coincides with Bitcoin’s price correction; after a 65% rise to a peak of $73,000 in March, the price has dropped nearly 20%, now hovering around $59,000.Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, provided insights into the situation, noting that while the recent outflows might seem alarming, they align with the typical ebb and flow expected in the early stages of ETFs. He pointed out that despite the market’s downturn, many investors still hold their positions, betting long-term on the asset’s value.The underlying volatility of Bitcoin, much like the recent price corrections influenced by various economic factors—including Federal Reserve policies and the aftermath of Bitcoin halving—remains a crucial reminder to investors about the inherent risks and opportunities in cryptocurrency investments.Moreover, while the market faces these challenges, the broader acceptance and growth of Bitcoin ETFs could be hampered by regulatory delays. For example, despite filings by major exchanges like Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE Arca to the SEC for trading related ETF options, there has been little progress.Balchunas likened the situation to putting a band’s music on Spotify as opposed to selling vinyl records — more audience might be reachable, but the core product must stand strong on its own merits.

Binance Wallet announces support for Bitcoin Atomical ARC-20 assets

Crypto exchange Binance has integrated Bitcoin ARC-20 atomical assets into its native Web3 wallet through its Inscriptions Marketplace. "ARC-20 is a token standard that makes it possible to create fungible tokens that can be held and transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain," Binance staff wrote on May 2. "To celebrate this new integration, we’re offering zero-fee trading on ARC-20 tokens until June 2, 2024."Invented in January, the Atomicals protocol, mirrored after Ethereum's ERC-20 standard, allows for the minting, transferring and updating of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain. "Even if an Atomical is updated or exchanges hands 10,000 times – that amounts to only about 2.5 MB of data (250 bytes x 10,000)," Atomicals developers explained. "Any client, wallet, marketplace, game, and service can rapidly verify the Atomical by processing the history according to the very simple rules."Outside of NFTs, current use for Bitcoin Atomicals includes web hosting, file storage, atomic swaps, real-world asset tokenization, decentralized social media, and many more. Aside from Atomicals, Binance Wallet's May 2 update also includes support for BEVM, a decentralized Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible Bitcoin layer-two based on Taproot that uses BTC as gas fees to execute smart contracts. The move follows the adoption of ARC-20 assets by other exchanges. In February, crypto exchange Bitget announced the support of Bitcoin Atomicals through its native self-custody wallet. Similarly, crypto exchange OKX has an entire marketplace dedicated to Bitcoin Atomical assets. Despite worries about becoming technologically obsolete with the rise of smart contract blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), Bitcoin is rapidly closing the technological gap with the advent of innovations such as Ordinals, Inscriptions, Runes, and Atomicals, all within the past year. Last quarter, Orders Exchange completed integration with the Bitcoin Runes protocol to allow the issuance of fungible tokens on the native network and constructed a Bitcoin asset bridge with MicroVisionChain that enables BRC-20 token swaps. Meanwhile, omnichain yield-generating protocol SolvBTC has accumulated a total value locked (TVL) of $700 million from its yield-bearing Bitcoin minted on Arbitrum, Merlin, and BNB Smart Chain. The protocol estimates the mechanism can generate annual returns of 5%–10% on users’ BTC deposits. Related: Kraken exchange rolls out self-custody crypto wallet, following other CEXs

Aave Labs Unveils Major Upgrades and Expansions with Aave V4 Proposal


																Aave Labs, the team behind the DeFi lending platform Aave, has proposed a slew of major upgrades and expansions two years after introducing its V3.
The suggested improvements include Aave V4, Aave Network, a Cross-Chain Liquidity Layer, non-EVM L1 deployments, and a fresh visual identity.
Aave V4
According to the latest blog post, Aave V4 will be built with a brand-new architecture featuring an efficient and modular design while aiming to minimize disruptions to third-party integrators.
The most important architectural change of the latest iteration is the proposed introduction of a Unified Liquidity Layer, which expands on the Portals concept introduced in Aave V3. This layer enables a fully agnostic, independent, and abstracted infrastructure for liquidity provisioning.
It is also proposed to manage supply/draw caps, interest rates, assets, and incentives while enabling other modules to draw liquidity from it. This would allow the Aave DAO to add or remove borrow modules without the need to migrate liquidity.




The main function of this architecture approach is to facilitate the addition or improvement of borrowing features without overhauling the entire system or the liquidation module while simultaneously addressing the issue of fragmented liquidity present in older versions of the protocol.
Aave’s proposal revealed that the liquidity layer is capable of natively supporting both supplied and natively minted assets, thereby improving integration with GHO and other collateralized protocol-native assets. Aave V4 also proposes fully automated interest rates with adjustable slopes and kink points.
Other Proposed Features
‘Smart Accounts’ is yet another feature that has been proposed for introduction in the V4 iteration in a bid to streamline the user experience by addressing a major issue with Aave V3 – eliminating the need for separate wallets to manage positions when borrowing using eMode or isolated assets. Users will be able to create multiple smart accounts within a single wallet, simplifying interactions with the protocol.
The proposal also features a dynamic configuration mechanism per asset, where users are “hooked” to the current configuration of an asset when they borrow. If a new asset configuration is needed, a new instance is created while existing users remain hooked to the previous configuration.
Meanwhile, the company mentioned that they are collaborating with Chainlink to investigate solutions for fully automating risk management. The concept involves utilizing ad-hoc, on-chain feeds to evaluate asset risk and dynamically adjust risk parameters through control theory or artificial intelligence.

MoonPay Integrates PayPal: Easy Crypto Buys Now Possible


MoonPay, a cryptocurrency payment gateway, has marked a significant milestone by announcing its integration with PayPal. 
This partnership enables US users to purchase cryptocurrencies using their PayPal accounts seamlessly. Therefore, it positions MoonPay as the first on- and off-ramp provider to offer such a service in the US.
MoonPay-Paypal Alliance
The collaboration between MoonPay and PayPal simplifies crypto purchases, especially for users already familiar with PayPal’s services. Customers can utilize their PayPal balance, direct bank withdrawals, or debit cards to fund crypto purchases directly on MoonPay’s platform. 
Ivan Soto-Wright, MoonPay’s co-founder and CEO, told BeInCrypto that the partnership reflects a significant step towards integrating traditional financial services with the field of digital currencies. It streamlines cryptocurrency trading to enhance the user experience.

“For MoonPay users transacting with PayPal, we’ve ensured the process is seamless – users can purchase with PayPal without setting up additional accounts or entering new payment information. And those with an existing PayPal account won’t need to manually input their card information when they buy crypto on MoonPay,” Soto-Wright said. 



He emphasized that this move aims to reduce the entry barriers for new users by providing a familiar transactional environment through PayPal.

“With PayPal embedded into MoonPay’s infrastructure, we can also further optimize conversion when transacting on our platform. Integrations like PayPal will have a significant impact on conversation rates. Many traditional banks do not allow users to purchase crypto on debit/credit cards, but when users pay with PayPal, using that same card, we have already seen a dramatic increase in the success rate of transactions,” Soto-Wright told BeInCrypto.

Moreover, the security measures provided by PayPal protect users’ financial details during transactions, adding an additional layer of trust and safety for MoonPay users. This integration is currently available to all MoonPay customers in the US. It is expected to roll out to MoonPay partner networks in mid-2024.

Major Development in One of the Most Popular Projects Once: Allegedly Will Distribute Airdrop - Bitcoin Sistemi


A cryptocurrency analyst known as CBB0FE on the
The analyst has reportedly discovered what appears to be version 2 of friend.tech smart contracts. However, he warned that these could be “a psychology experiment” by the friend.tech team designed to mislead or confuse observers.


The new token defined with the POINTS ticker cannot be transferred unless it is to certain whitelist addresses. Interestingly, POINTS can be traded on BunnySwap, friend.tech's native decentralized exchange (DEX).
The analyst also found a new smart contract called Clubs. This contract allows anyone to create multiple clubs and choose from a variety of options for a bonding cycle. Club keys are purchased with POINTS. The platform fee for this contract is set at 1.5%, and there is an additional 1.5% fee for the staking contract.






BunnySwap, the native DEX where POINTS can be traded, is known as a fork of Uniswap V2. It allows transactions with a 1.5% fee.
The analyst recently discovered a staking contract called BestFriend SC. A fork of MasterChef, this contract allows users to stake POINTS/ETH liquidity provider (LP) tokens to earn POINTS.


While these findings are certainly intriguing, it is important to remember that they are still speculative at this stage. The friend.tech team has not confirmed any of these details yet.

Asset Management Company BlackRock Announced That There Will Be Fund Flows to Bitcoin ETFs from Different Sectors! - Bitcoin Sistemi


BlackRock, the world's largest asset management company, is witnessing growing interest from a different type of investor in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
BlackRock Expects Increased Interest in Bitcoin ETFs from Sovereign Wealth Funds and Pension Funds
BlackRock head of digital assets Robert Mitchnick predicts that financial institutions such as sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and endowments will begin trading in spot ETFs in the coming months.



“Whether we're talking about pensions, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, insurers, other asset managers, family offices, many of these firms that are interested are having ongoing due diligence and research discussions, and we play a role in terms of education.”

Pent-up demand for the much-anticipated ETFs has seen more than $76 billion accumulated in these products since their approval in January.
Some registered investment advisors (RIAs) already offer BlackRock's IBIT ETF. The next step is expected to be the unlimited offering of Bitcoin ETFs to clients of major wealth advisory players such as Morgan Stanley.






A significant portion of current IBIT assets come from Grayscale exchanges. Other sources could be outflows from higher-priced international products in Canada or Europe, with some coming from Bitcoin futures ETFs being converted back into spot products.

Polkadot surprises traders with latest hike - Can DOT hit $7.5 next? - AMBCrypto



Bearish sentiment around Polkadot dropped in the last few days.
Most market indicators and metrics looked bullish on DOT.

The crypto market has been tumbling in the last few days as most cryptos fell. However, Polkadot [DOT] had other plans, as its daily chart remained green. Does this mean investors should expect the token’s price to rise further in the coming days? 
Polkadot takes a different route 
The recent market drop pushed Bitcoin’s price down by 10% over the last week. Not only BTC, but Ethereum also had a similar fate, as it dropped by nearly 2% in the last 24 hours. 
However, DOT planned to move the other way around. According to CoinMarketCap, Polkadot was up by more than 5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, it was trading at $6.85 with a market capitalization of over $9.8 billion, making it the 14th largest crypto. 
It was also interesting to note that while DOT’s price gained bullish momentum, the blockchain’s network activity also increased. As per AMBCrypto’s look at Artemis’ data, DOT’s daily active addresses have shot up since the 28th of April. 
Thanks to that, the blockchain’s daily transactions also increased. Things in terms of captured value also looked optimistic as both fees and revenue went up.
Source: Artemis
Will Polkadot’s bull rally last?
Since DOT had already begun a bull rally, AMBCrypto then planned to have a closer look at the token’s metrics to find out whether this trend would last longer.
 As per our analysis of Santiment’s data, DOT’s weighted sentiment improved, meaning that bearish sentiment around it decreased over the last few days. Its social volume spiked, reflecting its popularity in the crypto space. 
Source: Santiment
Apart from this, Polkadot’s derivatives metrics also looked optimistic. Its open interest increased along with its price. Whenever the metric moves up, it indicates the chances of the current price trend, which on this occasion was bullish, continuing further.
 Moreover, DOT’s funding rate was low. Generally, prices tend to move in a different direction than funding rates, hinting at a further price rise in the coming days. 
Source: Santiment
A few technical indicators also looked bullish. For example, the MACD displayed a bullish crossover. 
The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered an uptick, indicating a continued price increase. However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) turned bearish as it went down slightly.

Read Polkadot’s [DOT] Price Prediction 2024-25

As per our analysis of Hyblock Capital’s data, it will be crucial for DOT to go above $6.9 in order to sustain its rally. This seemed to be the case, as liquidation would rise shapely at that level, which might result in a price correction. 
A successful breakout above that level could allow DOT to touch $7.5 in the coming weeks.

Crypto's ETF Hype Slowing Down? | Bankless


Record ETF Outflows. Amid the crypto price slump, spot BTC ETFs in America had their worst day on record, posting an all-time high $534M in outflows. Can impending institutional adoption stymie the bleeding?Outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) amounted to $167M, a number that roughly aligns with declines from previous trading days. Unfortunately, that is where the similarities with historical spot BTC ETF flows stops…Not even BlackRock’s IBIT or Franklin Templeton’s EZBC – two ETFs that had yet to go negative – were spared from the drawdown, with yesterday becoming the first day on which every spot BTC ETF experienced simultaneous outflows.Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark Invest’s ARKB both experienced their largest outflow days on record and contributed a whopping $191M to the outflow total.Source: FarsideWhile depressed sentiment has been reflected in US ETF flows, action overseas is giving bulls some cause for optimism!Newly launched spot BTC and ETH ETF instruments in Hong Kong raised $292M of capital on their first day of trading, well ahead of schedule compared to Bloomberg analyst estimates for $1B of inflows within the first two years of launch.Additionally, BNP Paribas, the second-largest European bank with $570B in assets, reported ownership of $42k of BlackRock’s IBIT ETF in recently filed disclosures.Although the allocation represents only a tiny fraction of the bank's total assets, it marks the first confirmed purchase of BTC by a global systemically important bank (GSIB) and could signal that other major financial institutions are becoming comfortable with the concept of BTC adoption.
BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets Robert Mitchnick echoed similar sentiment, stating in an interview with CoinDesk that his conversations with interested firms indicate that sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and endowments may begin trading spot BTC ETF products within the coming months.Yesterday's BTC ETF outflows were certainly staggering, and while it is evident that future lulls in crypto markets will continue to trigger outflows from these products, the potential for widespread institutional adoption could propel BTC price to surpass even the most euphoric projections!Cathie Wood is targeting $3.8M BTC should institutions begin heavily investing in the coin, but nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether this anticipated demand can materialize.

Time To Buy The Bitcoin Dip? Analyst Upbeat As Federal Reserve Turns Dovish


								As Bitcoin drops, liquidating leveraged long bets along the way, one analyst, in a post on X, thinks this might be a prime opportunity to accumulate, citing historical patterns of pullbacks followed by impressive recoveries. 
Time To Load The Bitcoin Dip?
The analyst shared a chart indicating that Bitcoin is within historical retracement ranges. Whenever this happens, prices tend to bounce back sharply, tearing higher, much to the relief of holders.

Solid data back this assessment. The analyst said that since Bitcoin bottomed at $15,500 in 2022, there have been four distinct pullbacks, all within the -20% to -23% range. For the savvy, the trader continued, each of these downturns presented an opportunity to accumulate at a discount. 
Related Reading: Shiba Inu Fees On Fire: What’s Behind The 500% Surge?
Therefore, if history aligns with this preview, Bitcoin may be available at a discount at spot rates. At spot rates, the coin is down by around 23% from all-time highs of $73,800 in mid-March.
Bitcoin price trending downward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView
No one knows how prices will print out in the sessions ahead. However, looking at the candlestick arrangement, BTC has resistance at the $60,000 to $61,000 zone. A clean breakout above this zone might cement the analyst’s preview, setting in motion the start of another leg out that may take out $74,000 in the coming weeks.
Shrinking Spot ETF Inflows, United States Federal Reserve Turns Dovish
Though optimism reigns, the possibility of BTC crashing below the $52,000 and $50,000 support levels cannot be discounted. This outlook, though bearish, is also backed by data. 
For instance, on May 1, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) redeemed $563.7 million worth of BTC. In the past, when the coin was flying from February to mid-March, inflows were hundreds of billions. 
Excitement was palpable even with Grayscale liquidating GBTC, decreasing BTC. Now that there is a marked spike in outflows, it suggests that sellers are in control and spot ETF holders panicking and looking to exit. 

Despite the negative sentiment and predictions of Bitcoin melting to $52,000, another analyst remains positive. Citing the United States Federal Reserve reducing Quantitative Tightening (QT) runoff from $65 billion to $45 billion, the analyst continued that Bitcoin prices might benefit from the “dovish” environment. 
Of note is that the central bank said it is unlikely to hike interest rates. Instead, they look to slash rates when supportive data is showing that inflation is falling towards the 2% benchmark level. Currently, inflation remains high but lower than the 2021 averages.

Ripple's XRP Is Dead Money, Says Analyst Josh Olszewicz


Cryptocurrency analyst Josh Olszewicz recently expressed skepticism about Ripple’s XRP’s profitable trading asset viability. 
Highlighting the cryptocurrency’s lackluster performance, Olszewicz remarked on its stagnant price since 2018, labeling it “dead money.”
XRP’s Profit Potential Questioned
Despite a potential breakout attempt, XRP’s movement on March 11 was rejected. The digital currency tried to rally and break past the $0.66 resistance but failed to sustain higher levels due to intense selling pressure. This downturn led the price to dip below $0.42, setting the stage for a possible retest of the support level at $0.32.
According to Olszewicz, this trading environment for XRP remains fraught with challenges.

“XRP is at the same price it was since 2018… it’s dead right; it’s dead money… It just doesn’t make any sense to me why anybody would trade it unless they have a reallly good reason,” Olszewicz said. 


His analysis highlights a bearish trend on the weekly charts and inconsistency in daily movements, further complicating the trading of XRP.

If XRP’s price does manage to hold at $0.42 and subsequently breaks the Ichimoku Cloud at $0.87, it could indicate a weakening bearish grip. However, such a scenario appears less likely given the current market dynamics. 
Olszewicz’s perspective suggests that XRP’s price will likely hover within a narrow range without significant catalysts, making it a less attractive option for traders seeking substantial returns.

Tether and Chainalysis roll out USDT monitoring solution to counter illicit transactions - Crypto Briefing




Tether has announced a collaboration with blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis to develop a customizable solution for monitoring secondary market activity.The monitoring solution developed by Chainalysis will enable Tether to systematically monitor transactions and gain enhanced understanding and oversight of the USDT market. It will also serve as a proactive source of on-chain intelligence for Tether compliance professionals and investigators, helping them identify wallets that may pose risks or may be associated with illicit and/or sanctioned addresses.Key components of the solution include Sanctions Monitoring, which provides a detailed list of addresses and transactions involving sanctioned entities, and Categorization, which enables a thorough breakdown of USDT holders by type, including exchanges and darknet markets.The system also offers Largest Wallet Analysis, providing an in-depth examination of significant USDT holders and their activities, and an Illicit Transfers Detector, which is integral to identifying transactions potentially associated with illicit categories like terrorist financing.“Cryptocurrency is transparent, and harnessing that transparency to partner with law enforcement and freeze criminal funds is the best way to deter its use for terrorism, scams, and other illicit activity,” shares Jonathan Levin, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Chainalysis.The move comes amid mounting pressure on stablecoins and digital assets, with global regulators eyeing these for their potential role in circumventing international sanctions and facilitating illicit finance.As the most popular stablecoin with over $110 billion in circulation, USDT has faced increasing scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Tether claims that the partnership will enable it to “enhance compliance measures.” The stablecoin, which is pegged to the US dollar and backed primarily by US Treasury bonds, is managed by Wall Street trading house Cantor Fitzgerald.“Tether remains steadfast in its dedication to upholding the highest standards of integrity, and this collaboration reinforces our proactive approach to safeguarding our ecosystem against illicit activities,” shares Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino.A recent report from Reuters suggests that Venezuela’s state-run oil company has been using USDT to bypass US sanctions, while a United Nations report from January highlighted the stablecoin’s alleged role in underground banking and money laundering in East Asia and Southeast Asia. Notably, Tether has worked with 124 law enforcement agencies across 43 global jurisdictions to address concerns on the stablecoin’s use in illicit activities.

New Development in Terra (LUNA) Lawsuit in which SEC Demands $5 Billion - Bitcoin Sistemi


In Terra (LUNA) v. SEC, attorneys representing Terraform Labs are fighting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after the agency sought billions of dollars in fines. The firm's legal team argues that the token sales occurred “almost entirely outside the United States,” according to a brief filed Wednesday.
The SEC disputed this claim, arguing that Terraform Labs “targeted US investors” and therefore should pay a hefty $5.3 billion penalty, mostly in damages. However, Terraform's lawyers disputed this, stating, “…the SEC has presented no evidence that Defendants' limited activities in the United States directly caused any losses, losses in the United States far below the billions of dollars requested by the SEC.” said.



The SEC had previously charged Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon over the algorithmic stablecoin Terra USD (UST) in February 2023. This accusation followed the dramatic collapse of the IHR a year ago. Last month, a jury found both Terraform Labs and Kwon guilty of misleading investors and held them liable for civil fraud.
Algorithmic stablecoins like UST use market incentives through algorithms to maintain a stable price. Terra was linked to Luna, a governance token used to stabilize prices. However, the IHR collapsed in May 2022, resulting in a loss of more than $50 billion. The ongoing legal battle between Terraform Labs and the SEC continues as the future of the company and its cryptocurrencies remains uncertain.

Tether listed four of them in an announcement on its website. Sanctions Monitoring will provide a list of addresses and transactions that involve sanctioned entities. Illicit Transfer Detector will spot transactions that are potentially associated with activities such as terrorism financing.Categorization will classify Tether (USDT) holders by type, such as exchange or darknet market. Largest Wallet Analysis will focus on “significant” USDT holders and their activities. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said: “Our collaboration with Chainalysis marks a pivotal step in our ongoing commitment to establishing transparency and security within the cryptocurrency industry. […] This collaboration reinforces our proactive approach to safeguarding our ecosystem against illicit activities.”Tether has collaborated with authorities in 43 jurisdictions “to address illicit activities,” the announcement pointed out. Nonetheless, the company has come under fire for the stablecoin’s alleged role in criminal activities and terrorism financing.Related: Tether nets record $4.5B profit in Q1 2024 — majority from Bitcoin and goldTether even ran afoul of pro-crypto United States Senator Cynthia Lummis, who sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding an investigation of the role Tether and Binance played in the Hamas attacks on Israel in October. She and cosigner Representative French Hill alleged that Tether was “knowingly facilitating violations of applicable sanctions laws.”Source: TetherA report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime on organized crime in East and Southeast Asia released in January was heavily critical of the role crypto played in financing crime in the region and pointed to USDT in particular. Tether responded by saying the organization ignores the traceability of USDT.Tether has also been criticized for its lack of financial transparency. USDT has a market cap of $109.8 billion, far outflanking its nearest competitor USD Coin (USDC), whose market cap is $33.9 billion.Magazine: Blockchain detectives: Mt.

Coinbase earnings show a bullish start to the year - Blockworks


Coinbase’s earnings seem to show that crypto is ready for a bull market, if it’s not in one currently. 
The company impressed Wall Street with its earnings on Thursday, posting beats across the board.
Coinbase also reported that Base was continuing to see adoption. 
“We are seeing early product market fit with Base, our layer-2 solution, where developer activity has surged and Base has processed over 2x more transactions than Ethereum in the last 30 days,” Coinbase said in its earnings letter. 
Stablecoin revenue also jumped 15% quarter over quarter to $197 million. 
“The primary driver was higher USDC market capitalization, which is the total amount of USDC in circulation. The USDC market capitalization growth rate was the highest among all USD stablecoins in Q1,” the company added. 
Read more about the company’s earnings results in the article below:

Analysts were expecting the crypto exchange to come in on top, but the stock slipped in after-hours trading after notching gains throughout the day Thursday.
The stock hit a low of roughly $200 earlier this week, nearly $30 off of its current price. Bitcoin also notched a weekly low on Wednesday — falling to $56,000 before rebounding to $59,000. It’s down 8.5% in the past seven days.

While it’s important not to downplay Coinbase’s quarter, it is a snippet of time in the past. The weakness seen in the crypto market just this week won’t be reflected in the company’s earnings until next quarter. 
Over the past month, COIN is in the red — down roughly 8% — though it’s still posted impressive gains over the last year, up over 360%. 
Coinbase isn’t the only company showing off its strength as we enter the next phase of the crypto cycle. 
Earlier this week, Tether released its attestation. The stablecoin issuer announced that it smashed previous records, tallying a net profit of $4.5 billion in the first quarter. It previously notched an all-time high of $.28 billion in net profit.

Training AI on Your NFTs | Bankless


Last August, I introduced Metaversal readers to TITLES, an NFT remixing platform with an in-built attribution and payment splits system. After its initial app + protocol combo release, the TITLES team stepped back and realized that the issues of attribution and creative ownership were particularly significant in the emerging AI arts scene. Recognizing this, they’ve since adapted their existing tools to better support AI creatives. Their first major step forward here is a functionality they unveiled today, the ability for artists to train their own custom AI models on NFTs they’ve made before.The idea? Become a leading creator suite and minting hub for artist-trained AI models. I was fortunate enough to be treated to a preview of this new resource as TITLES founder Sören John was familiar with my collection of AI sketches, Stable Peasters, and invited me to test creating a custom model so anyone could make and mint their own Stable Ps. So I did! And I have to say, the process was buttery smooth and took only ~20 minutes. Here’s how the flow works in case you're interesting in trying it out for yourself: 2. In the “New Model” tab, select which of your NFT collections you want to train on—e.g. here I selected Stable Peasters3. Select 5 to 20 NFTs to train your model on and finalize your model’s basic info—the more visually harmonious your selected inputs are, the smoother your model’s outputs will be, so curate thoughtfully4. It will take up to 20 minutes for your model to finish training; you can track its progress in the “Your Models” tab5. When your model is ready, press the “Imagine” button to be taken to the prompting page, where you or anyone else can now create and mint new AI-powered remixes of your underlying collection—then share your model’s link to let others try it out!If you don’t have any NFT collections you’ve created of your own yet, but still want to play around with making AI remixes, try firing off some test prompts with my SPRY01 model, a.k.a. Stable Peasters Readily Yours V1, as seen above.You can input as many prompts as you want without minting anything, but if you do come across an output you love, feel free to save the image or use the TITLES interface to mint the piece as an NFT on Base—just fill out the description and mint details as you please and press “Publish” to finish. What’s cool is that every time outputs are minted like this on TITLES, the original model creator (e.g. me, in the case of SPRY01) earns a small cut of ETH from the mint. This approach allows AI creatives to earn and directly benefit from attribution while still openly sharing their work with everyone else.Looking ahead, keep an eye on TITLES as they enhance and expand upon this custom AI tool in new directions, e.g. allowing more than 20 NFT inputs and so forth. In the coming months, the team also notably plans to release a new AI-powered NFT publishing protocol that will offer artists innovative ways to engage with and profit from their models’ outputs. More on that later!In the meantime, follow TITLES on Twitter or Warpcast to stay current with the project, and if you do make your own AI model or publish any of your own Stable Ps, don’t hesitate to hit me up—I’d love to see what you come up with and would love to mint one of your editions as a keepsake!

Binance Nigeria Case Delayed Again as Procedural Errors Pile Up - DailyCoin


        
A Nigerian court has adjourned the money laundering case against Binance.



The latest delay in the case comes amid continued procedural errors from authorities.



The adjourned date now bears significance for many aspects of the Binance Nigeria debacle.
Delays continue to hound Nigeria’s legal effort against Binance and two of its executives.The trial of Binance and its executives Tigran Gambaryan, the firm’s head of Financial Crime Compliance, and Nadeem Anjarwalla, the firm’s regional manager for Africa, of U.S. and British-Kenyan descent, respectively, on a $35.4 million money laundering charge was supposed to kick off in Nigeria’s Federal High Court Abuja on Thursday, May 2. However, as in many instances in the case so far, procedural errors have caused delays.Binance Money Laundering Case AdjournedOn Thursday, Federal High Court Judge Justice Emeka Nwite adjourned the trial of Binance and its executives on money laundering charges brought by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Nigeria’s anti-graft agency, to May 17.
Per a local news report, the adjournment came as Binance lawyer Tonye Krukrubo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), told the court that contrary to the EFCC’s claims, he had not been served with the necessary documents to prepare for the case.Krukrubo was subsequently served with the reportedly 300 pages-long document in court after a bailiff explained that efforts to serve Binance through Tigran Gambaryan, who is being held in Nigeria’s infamous Kuje prison, had failed as he was inexplicably refused from seeing him.On April 4, Justice Nwite was forced to delay the arraignment of Gambaryan on these same money laundering charges and tax evasion charges from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Nigeria’s tax authority, for similar reasons. Expressing dissatisfaction with the continued lapses from the prosecution in the case, Justice Nwite cautioned against further delays on Thursday.
"It behooves on you, as prosecution, to do all within your power in the trial because I am not going to entertain any delay in this trial again," the Federal High Court judge warned.Meanwhile, following the judge’s recent decision, May 17 has become the date to watch for several aspects of the Binance Nigeria debacle.A Crucial DateBesides now serving as the date for the money laundering trial to kick off in earnest, May 17 is also the rescheduled date for the court to revisit the tax evasion charges brought by the FIRS and rule on Gambaryan’s bail application.The Binance executive was detained in Nigeria with Nadeem Anjarwalla in February 2024 after arriving at the invitation of authorities to negotiate the resolution of complaints bordering on the manipulation of the naira through the firm’s p2p platform. Despite being mid-level executives at Binance, they have been named in the money laundering and tax evasion charges against the firm.While Anjarwalla fled detention in March 2024, Gambaryan has now remained in Nigerian custody for over 60 days, nearly half of which has now been spent in a prison that also houses Islamic State terrorists.On the Flipside
On April 30, U.S. Representative Rich McCormick raised Gambaryan’s detention with the House Foreign Affairs Committee, disclosing that he is working to secure the release of the Binance executive who had also served a decade-long stint as a special agent in the Internal Revenue Service, contributing to several high profile crypto cases including the takedown of Silk Road.



Nigeria is working with Interpol to secure the extradition of Anjarwalla, who has been traced to Kenya.
Why This MattersThe frequent delays in the Binance case raise questions about Nigeria’s handling of the already controversial legal effort.Read this for more on the Binance Nigeria Debacle:Binance Exec Who Fled Nigeria Will Be “Smoked Out”: Interpol VPLearn about Ethereum’s recent record network growth:Ethereum Adds Over 260K Wallets in 2 Days: Will ETH Rally?

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) to Surge Over 7,000% in 48 Hours, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Will Bitcoin fall another 40%? 'Nothing but air,' analyst claims - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s recent price drop has led to significant market liquidations.
Poor performance of the Hong Kong and U.S. spot ETFs underline market struggles.

As Bitcoin [BTC] continued to struggle under significant market pressure, dipping below the $58,000 mark, analysts are now projecting a substantial price correction of 30-40% in the current market cycle. 
This potential drop could see the leading cryptocurrency adjust to values not seen since earlier bullish runs, sparking concerns and anticipatory strategies among investors.
Bitcoin dangles close to $55K
Bitcoin’s recent market behavior has been less than favorable, with a 10% decline over the past week, bringing its trading price precariously close to $55,000. 
According to analyst Scott Melker, Bitcoin has breached critical support levels that are now acting as resistance, potentially leading to further declines. He cautioned,
“Nothing but air until around $52,000 on the chart.” 
This suggested that Bitcoin could face a free-fall if it fails to maintain current support levels.
The technical perspective offers a bleak outlook as well. 
Melker pointed out that the Relative Strength Index (RSI), typically a reliable indicator of when an asset is oversold and likely to rebound, has not reached oversold territory. 
This deviation suggests a lack of strong buying interest and supports the thesis of further price drops. 
This condition is mirrored in the broader price trends observed on the charts, where Bitcoin exhibits a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, signaling sustained bearish momentum. 
According to Melker, the ongoing plunge is only a fraction of what is to come, noting,
“This is still ONLY A 23% correction, very shallow for a bull market and consistent with other corrections on this run. We are yet to see a 30-40% pull back during this bull market, like those of the past.”
Broader market implications
Beyond the immediate price action, broader market indicators reveal underlying challenges. 
Data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment showed a significant drop in Bitcoin’s daily active addresses. 
It plummeted from over 17 million in March to around 14.7 million as of the 1st of May, indicating waning user activity and interest. 
Source: Santiment
The Social Dominance echoed this sentiment, showing a 20% fall.
Source: Santiment
The downturn in Bitcoin’s value has not only dampened the aforementioned market metrics but has also triggered widespread liquidations, impacting numerous traders. 
According to Coinglass, in the last 24 hours alone, approximately 60,795 traders have been liquidated, with total liquidations amounting to $205.12 million. 
Source: Coinglass
Concurrently, as reported by AMBCrypto, the underwhelming debut of the newly listed spot ETFs in Hong Kong only exacerbated the situation. 
These ETFs managed a mere $11 million in trading volume on their first day, starkly contrasting with the much higher figures achieved by U.S.-based spot ETFs at their launch in January.
Furthermore, U.S. spot ETFs have been experiencing a significant outflow, with $161 million withdrawn on Tuesday alone, marking the fifth consecutive day of outflows, as analyzed by AMBCrypto using SoSo Value data. 

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

Additionally, the anticipation of the U.S. Federal Reserve maintaining steady interest rates in the upcoming FOMC meeting—due to higher-than-expected inflation—has led traders to withdraw from riskier investments. 
This added further pressure to an already strained market.

Is It a Good Time to Buy Ethereum (ETH)? On-Chain Data Says So


Ethereum (ETH) price witnessed a fate similar to the rest of the crypto market when the altcoin slipped below $3,000. This, however, has only further validated the bullish pattern ETH has been stuck in.
Closing in on a potential breakout in the next few trading sessions, the altcoin is exhibiting the ideal conditions for accumulation.
Ethereum Selling Slows Down
Investors need to exhibit optimism for a substantial bounce back in Ethereum’s price, as seen in parts of the recent shift in behavior.
The exchange net position change shows that ETH outflows have halted in the last 24 hours as investors refrain from profit-taking. Historically, such slowdowns succeed in a surge in price, after which selling continues.

Given the selling has taken a back seat for now, Ethereum has a shot at bouncing back to reclaim $3,000 as support.

Derived from the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which assesses investor profit or loss, Ethereum’s price could see an uptick.
Ethereum’s 30-day MVRV is sitting at -8%, which signals losses and potentially prompts accumulation. Historically, ETH recovery has occurred within the -4% to -10% MVRV range, labeled as an opportunity zone. 
If investors choose to make the most of it and stock up on ETH, the altcoin could note a stronger recovery.

ETH Price Prediction: 27% Rally
Ethereum’s price trading at $2,945 is bouncing back from the lower trend line of a descending wedge. ETH has been stuck in this pattern for the last two months. The decline below $3,000 only validated the bullish reversal pattern further. 
The likely move from here is an uptick to break through the upper trend line. This would enable ETH to note a potential 27% rally, placing the target price of Ethereum at $4,000.

On the other hand, the volatility of the investors’ optimism could threaten the potential of a rally if the broader market cues turn bearish. Failure to reclaim $3,000 could push ETH below $2,800, invalidating the bullish thesis and sending the altcoin to $2,740.

Popular Dogecoin (DOGE) Layer-2 Solution Dogechain To Shut Down Wallet Services Next Month - The Daily Hodl


								A prominent layer-2 scaling solution for the meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE) is announcing that it is going to be shutting down its wallet services next month.
In a new thread on the social media platform X, Mishaboar, one of Dogecoin’s developers, tells investors to make sure they move their DOGE out of the Dogechain wallet before it shuts down on June 1st as well as keep a copy of their wallet’s private keys.










“Make sure to move your DOGE out of http://dogechain.info (only use the .info domain!) before June 1st. Keeping a copy of Dogechain’s wallets’ private keys is also important – in case you still have the addresses in use somewhere, this will allow you to recover funds you might inadvertently send or receive there in the future.”
Dogechain, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain powered by the technology of Polygon (MATIC), was created as a way to connect the Dogecoin ecosystem to the world of Web3.
Using a proof-of-stake (POS) consensus mechanism, Dogechain allows for faster and cheaper transactions, making non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain-based video games, and decentralized finance (DeFi) services more accessible to holders of the meme coin.
Dogecoin is trading for $0.132 at time of writing, a 10.86% increase during the last 24 hours. On March 28th, DOGE was valued at $0.219.

Analyst Identifies Crucial Dogecoin Support At $0.112-$0.123, Will Price Crash Further? | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin suffered a significant crash in the bloodbath that rocked the crypto market earlier this week, notching double-digit losses in the process. This has sent its support lower, and $0.112-$0.123 is now the level to hold for the meme coin. But what if it falls below this support?
Dogecoin Must Hold Support At $0.112-$0.123
Crypto analyst YG Crypto, in an analysis, identified $0.112-$0.123 as the major support levels for Dogecoin after the price crash. In the post that was made on X (formerly Twitter), the crypto analyst explained that these levels are important due to the fact that they have prevent massive price crashes for Dogecoin in the past.

As such, the meme coin needs to maintain above this level to continue its bullish trend. As of the early hours of Thursday, the DOGE price continues to trade above the higher band of this level, suggesting that the support at $0.123 is significant.
However, YG Crypto warned that if it ends up unable to hold, it could be disastrous for the price. “If the price breaks below this support, it could signal further downward pressure,” the crypto analyst warned. Further, a breakdown below the lower band of this support would constitute another 15% crash, leading to a cumulative 50% decline in the DOGE price from its 2024 peak.


If Dogecoin is able to maintain this support, then buying here could be a unique opportunity. However, the analyst also expressed that technical indicators are not the only useful tools, as market sentiment can also play a big role in where the price could be headed next.
DOGE Price Could Break Out Higher
While the fundamentals seem to be turning bearish for Dogecoin right now, not all analysts are expecting a price decline. One of these bullish crypto analysts is Ali Martinez, who has identified a formation in the DOGE price chart that hasn’t been seem nice 2021.
Martinez explained in his analysis that the Dogecoin price had finally broken out of a descending triangle, something that has been historically bullish for the price. At the same time, the crypto analyst calmed investors’ fears, saying that the current 40% drawdown in the meme coin’s price is par for the course going by historical performance.

According to the analyst, the DOGE price had seen a similar 40% decline in 2017 before breaking out of a descending triangle. The result of this breakout was a 982% bull run that sent the price to new all-time highs. A similar trend was registered in 2021 as well, when the DOGE price fell 56% before breaking out of a descending triangle. This time around, Dogecoin went on its legendary 12,197% rally to reach a new all-time high as well.
Since the meme coin seems to be closely following this trend, the belief that it will do the same thing has become stronger. In the case of 2024, the price has seen a 40% drawdown and has now broken out of a descending triangle. If history rhymes once more, the analyst believes that DOGE can rally 4,600% to $6.


“Over the years, #Dogecoin appears to mirror its previous bull cycles! All you need is a little bit of patience,” Ali Martinez concluded.

Crypto leaders should stop flirting with CBDCs

Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) offer governments the ability to exert absolute control over currency. They should be rejected by all fair-minded blockchain leaders, but that unfortunately is not the case.In June 2023, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) noted that most cryptocurrency innovations have come from the private sector. But it praised central banks for “catching up” through the experimentation of CBDCs and creating state-controlled instant payment systems — like Brazil’s Pix.CBDCs are an experimental form of digital money created by a country's central bank. They are generally controlled through a private network and are both centralized and programmable. This means that central banks can track, monitor and edit transactions. Such capabilities grant authorities extensive control over money flows — including the power to impose spending restrictions, set “expiration” dates on consumers’ savings, and even remotely freeze or seize money. And by 2030, CitiGroup predicts there will be $5 trillion in CBDCs circulating in the global economy.Related: Jerome Powell’s pivot heralds a boring summer for BitcoinWhile some crypto leaders have been quietly concerned about the rise of CBDCs and what they could mean for privacy, democracy and rising authoritarianism, others have openly supported them — even as they paradoxically promote the advantages of decentralized technologies. CitiGroup projections for the level of CBDC usage in 2030. Source: CitiGroupConsensys, the owner of MetaMask and Infura, is one example. It is widely recognized as a foundational force in blockchain technology. It also has an incredibly flirtatious relationship with CBDCS. In partnership with Visa, Consensys is crafting new infrastructure designed to bridge central banks with traditional financial institutions. Other cryptocurrency projects — including Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM) — have likewise been active in allowing their blockchains to be used in the development of CBDCs.Ripple's native cryptocurrency, XRP, operates on a decentralized public ledger akin to Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). Yet, in 2021, Ripple introduced a CBDC platform on a separate, private ledger designed specifically for governments, central banks, and financial institutions. This setup allows these entities to exercise complete control over their newfound digital currencies.Conversely, Stellar advocates for creating CBDCs on its public blockchain, albeit with custom adjustments that allow centralized entities to enhance governance. Within its CBDC Guidebook, Stellar suggests managing monetary policy and programmability centrally but maintaining a decentralized approach to the technological infrastructure and service delivery.In a perfect world, you'd hope major blockchain players like Ripple and Stellar — with their significant banking connections — could use their influence to resist CBDCs on morality grounds, despite the tempting business prospects they present. Yet, even in an imperfect world, it would be impactful for them to openly discuss the real long-term threats of CBDCs — particularly the risks of giving governments overwhelming financial omnipotence. Of course, blockchain pioneers might be happy to see their formerly marginalized technology now discussed in high-level forums such as the IMF and Davos. Yet, while this recognition may be gratifying, it doesn’t translate into a victory for the ideals of blockchain technology. It’s quite the opposite: CBDCs compromise the core principles and benefits of blockchain — such as immutability and decentralization. Can governments be trusted with such power? Historically, the answer is “No,” even in the West. Canada served as one example in 2022 when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau activated the Emergencies Act to unconstitutionally freeze bank accounts linked to anti-lockdown protesters. United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt provided another example when, in 1933, he signed an executive order mandating that citizens hand their gold over to the federal government — or face up to $10,000 in fines and 10 years in prison.Regardless of the consumer safeguards that may be implemented within various future CBDCs, governments will certainly retain extensive control to modify, adjust, and redefine the rules governing this future form of money over time. Related: Solana illustrates the dark side of monolithic blockchainsWhen it suits them, western governments will impose financial sanctions against their own citizens for political means. It's not rocket science to understand embracing CBDCs risks emboldening and normalizing the use of these measures.Cryptocurrencies have been mocked, ridiculed and admittedly have a PR problem following the collapse of FTX and other scammers in the industry. But despite all of cryptos' challenges, its technology, applications and ethos makes the need for CBDCs redundant. We don't need CBDCs for fast, low-fee, accessible transactions for all. Crypto can already do it. With KYC (know your customer) measures, governments can already monitor, tax income and crack down on money laundering in crypto where it arises, without the need for excessive centralized control. CBDCs could be the start of a very slippery slope towards an authoritarian new norm. It's up to our greatest minds and leaders in both blockchain and beyond to wake up and stop flirting with CBDCs. Thought leaders can actively fight back by supporting decentralized alternatives. However, being more vocal in both opposing and challenging CBDCs will empower others to do the same. The current bull run will draw in millions of new investors and enthusiasts — maybe up to 1 billion by the end of 2025. Let's leverage this publicity to spread the word that CBDCs are not the only way forward.Callum Kennard is the founder of Guava Studio, an e-commerce and Web3 marketing agency based in the United Kingdom.

Terraform claims SEC offered ‘no evidence’ for $4.7B in disgorgement

With a hearing scheduled for May 22 to listen to proposed remedies in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) case against Terraform Labs (TFL) and co-founder Do Kwon, the crypto firm has argued for a substantially different judgment than that proposed by the regulator.In a supplement to Terraform’s opposition to the SEC’s motion for final judgment filed on May 1, lawyers representing the crypto firm argued the financial regulator was not entitled to $5.3 billion in disgorgement, interest and civil penalties following a jury finding TFL and Kwon liable for fraud. Terraform built on its previously asserted claims that any disgorgement would effectively have to be obtained from the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a “non-party” in the civil case.According to lawyers for Terraform, the SEC had “no evidence” that the platform’s or Kwon’s activities in the U.S. caused the losses at the center of the civil case. If the commission were to claim disgorgement and civil penalties, according to Terraform, it would give the regulatory a “territorially unlimited injunction.”Source: PACER“TFL’s offers and sales of tokens occurred almost entirely outside the U.S. [...] and the SEC has submitted no evidence that Defendants’ limited activities in the U.S. directly caused any losses, much less the billions the SEC seeks in disgorgement,” said the May 1 filing.Related: Do Kwon’s Terraform Labs files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protectionIn an April 26 filing, Terraform claimed that $1 million in civil penalties would be “far more appropriate” than the SEC’s multibillion-dollar proposal. Kwon, who is currently in Montenegro awaiting extradition to either the U.S. or South Korea, opposed the SEC’s proposed remedies to the civil case on similar grounds to Terraform:“[T]he SEC must still establish that Mr. Kwon engaged in conduct within the United States or conduct without the United States that had a ‘foreseeable substantial effect’ in the United States,” said lawyers for the Terraform co-founder. “Mr. Kwon’s role in the conduct that forms the basis of the SEC’s requested judgment was performed entirely abroad, in Korea and Singapore.”A jury found Terraform and Kwon liable for defrauding investors after a two-week trial with the SEC. All parties are scheduled to present arguments for proposed remedies before Judge Jed Rakoff on May 22. However, it was unclear at the time of publication whether Kwon would be available due to his legal situation in Montenegro.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

Veteran Analyst Speaks Out on Cardano (ADA) - Can ADA Price Bounce Back? - "Trend Reversal Seen" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ali Martinez, one of the well-known analysts in the cryptocurrency world, evaluated the popular altcoin Cardano (ADA) in his latest post.
According to the analyst, the TD Sequential indicator, which correctly predicted the top in Cardano, is currently giving a bullish sign on ADA's daily chart. Martinez said the indicator is forecasting a one- to four-day daily candle rebound that could represent the end of ADA's correction phase.


ADA price is trading at $0.45 at the time of writing this article and has increased by 2.74% in the last 24 hours. However, the price of ADA, which is the 9th largest altcoin in the world, has decreased by 22.5% in the last month. ADA's market capitalization currently stands at $16.2 billion.

In addition, touching on the Bitcoin price, the analyst claimed that the TD Sequential indicator also gave a bull sign on Bitcoin's daily chart. According to the analyst, this indicator for BTC again signaled a rebound on the one to four-day candle.





The TD Sequential indicator is known as a technical analysis tool developed by Tom DeMark. Designed to identify trend extinctions and potential price reversals in financial markets. This indicator works on the principle that prices tend to move in certain patterns before reversing or continuing in the same direction.

Coinbase reports $1.64 billion in revenue on Q1 - Crypto Briefing




Crypto exchange Coinbase reported $1.64 billion in revenue for the first quarter, surpassing the initial expectations of $1.32 billion, as reported by CNBC.The earnings per share stood at $4.40, which may not align directly with the average analyst estimate of $1.09 due to different accounting standards. Coinbase’s net income reached $1.18 billion, or $4.40 per share, marking a stark contrast to the previous year’s loss of $78.9 million, or a loss of 34 cents per share. This profit includes a $650 million mark-to-market gain on crypto assets, reflecting the company’s adoption of updated accounting standards.Consumer transaction revenue hit $935 million, more than doubling from the previous year, while total transaction revenue nearly tripled to $1.07 billion. Subscription and services revenue also contributed with $511 million for the quarter. Despite trading 4% lower in extended trading, Coinbase shares have seen a 30% increase this year, following an almost fivefold surge in 2023.The first quarter also witnessed Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of over $73,000 in March, and Ethereum undergoing a significant upgrade. The influx of institutional investors, particularly with the SEC’s approval of US spot bitcoin ETFs, has also played a role in Coinbase’s performance.By the end of the quarter, these funds had attracted over $50 billion, with many partnering with Coinbase for custody services. However, the company faces challenges, including a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and increased competition from Crypto.com.Additionally, analysts from Raymond James pointed out that four C-suite members of Coinbase sold over $383 million in shares, the most since the company’s Nasdaq listing in 2021.

5 Reasons to Stay Bullish on Crypto | Bankless


If you haven’t noticed, market sentiment has been... pretty bad lately.Bitcoin is down significantly over the past month, a number of altcoins are down much worse, leaving many across Crypto Twitter to share messages of doom and gloom. Yet, despite the current downturn, historical trends and underlying movements suggest we are far from the end of this cycle. Today, we're digging into hope. Here are five reasons not to lose faith in this cycle and look beyond the market's current turmoil.1️⃣ Drawdowns = NormalFor veterans of the cryptocurrency markets, volatility is par for the course.As Bitcoin's fourth 20% correction within the last 12 months, the current pullback proves nothing unusual historically. Surviving multiple drawdowns — ranging from mild 5-10% dips to severe 40-70% plunges — and not getting shaken out is a typical experience during a bull market. Corrections are not just common; they're expected.
2️⃣ Historic Timing At this point, the Bitcoin halving's importance is not so much in its impact on supply as what it implies for the next 12-18 months.Analysis reveals that market bottoms typically occur about 1.3 years before a halving, with peaks following roughly 1.3 years after, around 480 days.These drops can be viewed as a regular pitstop on the road to new all-time highs, aligned with the broader cyclical rhythm of Bitcoin's continued ascent.3️⃣ Institution Long-Term PlaysNow, consider the conviction investors require to lock significant capital into tokens with a multi-year horizon. Recently, a16z acquired about $90M of Optimism's OP token with a two-year vesting period, showing a strong conviction in the Superchain’s potential. Similarly, institutional funds bought $100M of locked SOL during the FTX estate's sale, with terms locking these tokens for a four-year vesting period. This second round of sales, the first seeing $1.7B worth of SOL sold earlier in March, comes at a measly 15% discount ($95-110) to current market prices (~$130) — adding to the significance of the four-year vesting period. These long-term purchases speak to a deep-set conviction of where the market will continue to trend over the coming years.
4️⃣ Fear & Greed SignalsAs a young market that turns on narratives first and foremost, emotion plays a pivotal role in crypto.By examining the Fear & Greed Index, much can be discerned about where the market is headed. On the index, 0 equals max fear, while 100 equals max greed. When the index hit 90 last month, the decline we are experiencing today started. It now sits at ~50, neutral territory that historically signals a bottom is near. On January 24, the index read 48. The following month and a half saw Bitcoin rally from $39K to $73K. A similar pattern occurred last October. The index hit 44, and BTC climbed from ~$26K to $40K by the first week of December.What did Warren Buffett say? Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful?5️⃣ Government HostilityUltimately, the war the U.S. government wages against crypto signals one thing — crypto remains a tool for securing digital rights and freedoms. At its core, Bitcoin and crypto were created to develop a system for true financial independence. With ~25% of the world unbanked and the rest operating on antiquated rails, blockchains offer a solution not only to expedite and connect the whole world’s financial systems, but also to truly own their wealth and access it from anywhere in the world. The recent crackdowns highlight this power, the old world grappling with it, and demonstrate crypto’s ability to preserve financial independence, property ownership, and other fundamental rights. As we move deeper into a fully digital age, the case for crypto enabling digital autonomy only grows more potent, extending beyond finance to also include self-custody of your data and online identity.
🙏Hope AheadDespite the current market sentiment, there remains a compelling case for optimism about the market. The resilience of Bitcoin through its continuous drawdowns, the historical rhythms around halvings, institutions going long, market sentiment indications, and the role crypto plays in preserving digital rights clearly demonstrate reasons to remain bullish. As these cycles play out, it may be wise to expect more corrections going forward but to view them as opportunities, not drawbacks.

Coinbase $1.6 Billion Quarterly Profits Boosted By Stablecoins, Rising Crypto Prices - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsAmerica’s leading crypto exchange said Thursday that sales jumped to $1.6 billion in the first quarter of this year as transaction revenue doubled over the prior three months.Coinbase’s first-quarter revenue is up big compared to $772 million over the same period year ago, the $1.6 billion bottom line exceeding analyst expectations of $1.3 billion. The San Francisco-based company also reported earnings of $4.40 per share, coming in well above Wall Street expectations of $0.90. Coinbase’s transaction revenue jumped to $1.1 billion in the first quarter from $374 million a year ago—doubling transaction revenue of $523 million in the fourth quarter of last year.Coinbase said in a letter to shareholders that its platform saw “revitalized trading activity among customers acquired prior to 2023” alongside growth in new users—including institutional traders. Coinbase turned green last year in the final quarter when it reported a profit of $273.4 million, compared with a loss of $557 million in the same quarter in 2022. A year ago, the company posted a quarterly loss of $79 million as crypto markets languished in the aftermath of FTX.The exchange said in February that it strengthened its balance sheet by reducing debt by $413 million, and its business of allowing customers to earn interest on its USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin helped the company net bigger gains. Interest in the exchange’s stablecoin services increased this year, too: Coinbase said that revenue from the crypto product increased 15% this quarter from the last to $197 million. It added in its shareholder letter that USDC has been the fastest-growing stablecoin in 2024. Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to a stable asset—usually dollars. Coinbase allows its customers to earn interest on such cryptocurrencies. The company refers to these as blockchain rewards. Revenue from Coinbase users staking crypto came in at $151 million, more than double compared to a year ago.The rise in the price of cryptocurrencies following the January approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also helped Coinbase make money. The price of Bitcoin has rallied this year and touched a new all-time high of $73,747 in March. It was trading for a little over $44,000 at the beginning of the year. Coinbase has partnered with most major asset managers that dropped a Bitcoin ETF, providing custody services. In effect, Coinbase said the ETFs’ approvals “unlocked a flywheel of customer engagement across [a] more robust product suite.”Coinbase’s shares rallied 8% Thursday to $230 per share, Nasdaq data shows. But the company’s stock price fell in after-hours trading to around $224 per share following the company’s earnings release.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

As MakerDAO grows, will MKR’s price finally cross $3K? - AMBCrypto



MakerDAO’s market cap and revenue grew significantly over the past year.
Price of MKR surged, despite declining network growth.

Despite the uncertainty the crypto markets have faced over the last few months, MakerDAO [MKR] has been consistently performing well.
MakerDAO expands
According to recent data, MKR’s market cap is up five times in terms of year-on-year growth, while monthly revenues are up 10 times in terms of year-on-year growth.
Source: token terminal
MakerDAO’s dominance in the DeFi sector is a significant factor contributing to this trend. Maker, currently, accounts for nearly 40% of all DeFi profits on Ethereum [ETH].
Its strength lies in its stablecoin DAI, which boasts widespread adoption, deep liquidity, extensive integrations, and a proven track record.
In fact, Maker’s financial prowess is so substantial that it generates more fees than many Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions.
Source: X
Staking season
Historically, Maker has been criticized for its conservative approach. However, its ongoing Endgame rollout aims to change this perception by transforming Maker into a more scalable ecosystem of modular protocols.
In this cycle, Maker is poised to play a crucial role in the staking, restaking, and tokenized basis trading economies by offering on-chain financing options for users.
This presents a multi-billion dollar fee opportunity, positioning Maker to capture a significant portion of DeFi profits.
Already, Maker generates substantial revenue from lending against a fraction of the stETH supply, rivaling the income generated by Lido across the entire stETH supply.
Source: Syncracy
The anticipated use cases for liquid restaking tokens and tokenized basis trading positions are expected to yield similar outcomes, further bolstering Maker’s financial position.

Realistic or not, here’s MKR’s market cap in BTC’s terms

At press time, MKR was trading at $2,706.20 and its price had grown by 4.28% in the last 24 hours. The volume at which it was trading at had surged by 20.16%.
In terms of network growth, there was a decline seen on the broader chart, indicating waning interest from new addresses.

Jack Dorseyâs Block doubles down on Bitcoin, commits 10% of product profit to monthly BTC purchases - Crypto Briefing




Block, the financial services and digital payments company co-founded by Jack Dorsey, has announced plans to purchase Bitcoin every month using 10% of its gross profit from Bitcoin products. The new investment strategy shows the company’s long-term commitment to the flagship crypto, which Dorsey has frequently endorsed as a significant innovation in finance.“We believe the world needs an open protocol for money, one that’s not owned or controlled by any single entity,” Jack Dorsey said in a letter to shareholders on Thursday. “We believe Bitcoin is the best and only candidate to be that protocol, and to ultimately become the native currency of the internet.”As reported, Block’s substantial $220 million investment in Bitcoin has already appreciated by approximately 160%, amounting to $573 million at the end of Q1/2024. This growth comes amid a surge in Bitcoin prices, driven by factors such as US regulatory approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.However, the volatility of the crypto market remains a concern. Despite the risks, Block shows a willingness to adapt as necessary.“We would check back in on this approach and assess Bitcoin as a percentage of our overall liquidity, and would continue to remain nimble in how we move forward here,” Amrita Ahuja, Block’s Chief Financial Officer told Bloomberg.In the first quarter, Block’s Cash App reported a profit of $80 million from Bitcoin transactions, contributing to the company’s current holdings of 8038 BTC.The company’s financial performance has been strong, with first-quarter gross profit reaching $2.09 billion, largely fueled by the $1.26 billion generated by Cash App. Following the announcement, Block’s shares saw a 7.4% increase in late New York trading.Block operates in various sectors including financial services, digital payments, and blockchain technology. The company, formerly known as Square, offers a range of services aimed at small and medium businesses. Currently, less than 3% of Block’s resources are dedicated to Bitcoin projects.Apart from Cash App, the company is also involved in the Bitcoin mining business and self-custody wallet service. In late April, Block officially completed the development of its advanced three-nanometer Bitcoin mining chip and now focuses on building a full Bitcoin mining system.

Bitcoin Price Tumbles After Halving, Defying Expectations of a Rally



                    

The Bitcoin market has experienced a significant downturn following its fourth halving, confounding expectations of a surge similar to previous cycles. 



Since the halving event on April 20, Bitcoin’s value has plummeted by 11%. 




It was trading around $64,000 at the time of the halving, briefly climbed above $67,000 two days later, but then dropped to below $57,000 by May 1, as per CoinGecko.



Currently, the price stands at $57,362, marking a 7% decrease over the last 24 hours and a 17% decline over the month. 



This downturn has surprised market observers who anticipated a rise post-halving, in line with historical trends where significant rallies often followed such events. 




For instance, after the 2016 halving, Bitcoin surged approximately 3,000% within 17 months, achieving a then-record high of $20,000 in December 2017.



This year’s halving diverges from previous patterns due primarily to an unprecedented bull run leading up to the event, which saw Bitcoin reach new highs.

“What’s unique about this latest Bitcoin halving is the incredible bull run and price action leading up to it. 




“Even considering this recent pullback, Bitcoin has still been up 35% since the start of the year,” Mati Greenspan of Quantum Economics explained to Cointelegraph.



Greenspan also reasoned that the recent drop was predictable, given broader economic pressures and market trends, remarking, “Considering the expectation of yet another Fed pivot and what’s happening in the stock market, Bitcoin’s current price action is hardly a surprise. 



“We’ll be a lot smarter about that later today, though.” 



Predictions had been made as early as March 2024 by analysts at JPMorgan, suggesting a potential decline in Bitcoin’s price to around $42,000 post-halving.



Markus Thielen, CEO and head analyst at 10x Research, forecasts a further dip to $52,000. Thielen attributes the previous rally mainly to substantial inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, which have significantly reduced recently.



Despite the current decline, some experts, including investment researcher Lyn Alden, believe there are compelling reasons, beyond just the halving and U.S. ETFs, for Bitcoin to achieve new heights in 2024.

Solana ($SOL) ‘Sniper’ Snags $780,000 in 15 Minutes from Newly Launched Token | Cryptoglobe


                                
A cryptocurrency trader has managed to turn 500 Solana ($SOL) tokens worth around $67.000 into 5,789 SOL worth over $780,000 in just 15 minutes after managing to “snpe” a large portion of a newly launched cryptocurrency’s supply.



According to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the cryptocurrency ‘sniper’ managed to acquire 665 million $QUACK tokens as they first started trading, and later sold the tokens for a significant profit of over $700,000 as its price surged, before the dump led to a downturn.







The cryptocurrency ‘sniper, as Lookonchain referred to them, is likely to be an insider in the project, as insiders have over the current cycle been taking advantage of memecoin token launches to first pump up their prices, and score massive wins in the process.



As CryptoGlobe reported, the team behind a project recently managed to turn just over $6,400 worth of cryptocurrency into over $8.28 million in a single day through the launch of such a meme-inspired cryptocurrency.



In another case, a trader  turned an initial investment of $49,000 into nearly $2 million within just five hours with a newly launched memecoin as well. While insiders have been benefitting, the wider memecoin trend has seen traders make—and lose—fortunes in relatively short amounts of time.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

One trader, for example, managed a loss of $46,000 in just three minutes after the price of the token, Milady Wif Hat ($LADYF) plunged. The incident highlights several key factors native to the cryptocurrency space, which include the volatility inherent to it that’s especially present in lesser-known and meme-inspired cryptocurrencies and the liquidity issues that these newly launched tokens can have, forcing traders to suffer significant losses due to slippage.



In another case, a memecoin saw a dramatic price rise of over 3000% over a 24-hour period, and a cryptocurrency trader managed to take advantage by betting 50 $SOL, worth around $9,000, in the cryptocurrency. Its rise has seen them make a profit of over $123,000.



In another case, a cryptocurrency trader managed to make a profit of over $3 million trading a newly launched Solana-based memecoin within just 12 minutes after betting nearly $2 million on it right after it started trading.



In yet another incident, a trader, identified on-chain by the alias “sundayfunday.sol,” turned a $72,000 investment into a staggering $30 million within just three days trading a little-known cryptocurrency.

2 May: Four New Solana Memecoins That Could Rally 9,000% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.







Market Cap: $3,000




Contract Address: Aeem6NMbRzcLCFxJWCYWatevYLEKEi1P1YkkYJv7dgUd







Market Cap: $16,000



Contract Address: 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML







Market Cap: $15,000




Contract Address: 37Tfn3F5E84KvitHHQVK37KzZZ3qAPCdxjGgBJd8XoVs







Market Cap: $19,000



Contract Address: AiqeRZVZgPkDVVXNTYqz7xGA7bgwuTgE1ShqCkC7C7Em



How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

This Is Why Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Could Drop to $0.10


Dogecoin (DOGE) price could soon incur further losses as investors remain skeptical.
Indeed, the meme coin’s investors are largely pessimistic, without increasing investments.
Dogecoin Loses Support
Dogecoin’s price falling below $0.15 accelerated the decline, bringing the doge-themed token to $0.131 at the time of writing. The meme coin is attempting to secure the support of $0.127, a level that has been tested numerous times in the past.
However, it might face some struggle as DOGE will likely drop back soon owing to investors’ waning support. 

Over $1 billion has been removed from the Futures market in the last three weeks. Indeed, Dogecoin’s Open interest (OI) dropped from $1.6 billion to $667 million in the span of 20 days. This metric represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts held by market participants at any time.

Investors’ actions fall in line with their sentiment as well. Since the beginning of April, DOGE holders have exhibited largely pessimism towards the meme coin. The crypto market conditions and the lack of bullish cues within the Dogecoin network have pulled investors towards bearish expectations.
This is visible in the weighted sentiment, which has been negative for nearly the past month.

DOGE Price Prediction: Failing the Hold
Dogecoin’s price in the short-term timeframe is stuck within a falling wedge. However, this bullish pattern was invalidated after DOGE fell through the lower trend line and received support of $0.127. While the meme coin did recover, it will potentially slip back soon.
The altcoin will likely fall to $0.116, which could create the conditions for a further decline to $0.105. This is the potential outcome on the 4-hour chart.

However, a successful retest of $0.127 could give Dogecoin’s price a shot at securing the recovery. If DOGE does so and rises to breach $0.140, it could test the resistance at $0.151, invalidating the bearish thesis and enabling further rise.

Whales Dive Back Into Solana Meme Coins with SEALANA Crypto Presale Raising $100,000 in Minutes

                        Thursday, May 2, 2024 – A presale for Sealana ($SEAL), the all-American redneck seal, launched on Solana yesterday, taking in $100,000 within minutes of launch.In a sector dominated by land-roving canines, one marine mammal is trading his way out of mom’s basement like a true 21st-century patriot pursuing the elusive American Dream.If his face is familiar, that’s because Sealana is a spin on the viral South Park character Gamer Guy, aka Fat Computer Nerd.Gamer Guy appeared in the hit cartoon’s side-splitting World of Warcraft episode and instantly became a viral meme all on his own, recognizable by his milk-bottle glasses, screen-locked stare, messy room and gravity-defying girth.He has since been used to symbolize anyone from the legions of disgruntled keyboard warriors writing sharp, acerbic opinions in internet comments sections, to a kind of Everyman – a symbol of the idler in everyone.Sealana is Gamer Guy but made in Web3. Whaled at his PC and growing by the day, Sealana is so absorbed in degen trades that he’s abandoned the trim figure of his youth for a diet of chips and tinned tuna. His obsession with finding the next big Solana meme coin keeps his flippers busy and his room looking like a bomb hit it.All anyone needs to dive into the fixed-price presale is a funded SOL wallet. For every 1 SOL, investors get 6,900 $SEAL tokens airdropped to them on the ICO’s conclusion. This puts them in pole position to exploit some potentially explosive appreciation through the presale and the potential Solana meme coin gold rush beyond.Users can pay using a widget on the website or by sending SOL from a decentralized wallet to this address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.Are Meme Coin Fans Now Settling on Solana?
Sealana’s native blockchain, Solana, is rapidly outdoing Ethereum to become the go-to blockchain to launch tomorrow’s biggest meme coins.Amidst a brutal recent sell-off that plunged the price of Bitcoin ($BTC) down 10% to about $57k, Solana coin Popcat ($POPCAT) is pumping 45% in seven days while Solama ($SOLAMA) rallied 25% overnight. Even Dogecoin-imitating chainmates like DogWifHat ($WIF) and Bonk ($BONK) are currently retaining value better than their competitors.Solana itself is also quickly recovering. In the last 24 hours, the price of SOL leapt 10%, far outpacing market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum and showing the fast rebounding capabilities of blockchain’s biggest growing ecosystem.The reasons for this are no mystery. Solana is a digital economy housing $3.637 billion in total value locked (TVL) across various apps and financial services, with over 1 million active users transacting daily and over 2,500 monthly active developers.Sealana also comes hot on the heels of another recent viral Solana meme coin ICO. Slothana ($SLOTH), the 420-friendly sloth, raised a staggering $15 million in a one-month presale that has just concluded.Speaking of popular crypto sloths, there are rumors that the Sealana team was also behind the scenes of another successful fixed-price presale, the popular Slerf ($SLERF) project, which is up 15% in the last 24 hours.Word on the grapevine is that they are having a go at another successful launch, without accidentally burning $10 million worth of tokens.Meme Coin Gold Rush After Bitcoin Halving?
This week’s fallen prices reflect a market that is briefly doing a spot of profit-taking before the effects of a Bitcoin software update known as “the halving” become clearer.The halving slashed mining rewards from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125, effectively halving the issuance of new BTC. Now, with Bitcoin setting new all-time highs this year, many analysts say the crypto market is set to become much more valuable, thanks to the depleted Bitcoin supply.VIDEOThe past three halvings have added significant value to the market well within a year of the update.And when traders begin seeing market-wide green candles again, further meme coin gold rushes will ensue. This time, Solana and its affiliated projects will be at the helm.Don’t ignore the patriot’s call to help Sealana Web3 his way out of mom’s basement.Simply bulk him up with SOL and watch him send a tsunami of $SEAL straight into your wallets!Interested?

                        MoonPay partnered with financial technology giant PayPal on May 2 to expand its crypto trading services within the United States. This collaboration allows MoonPay users to purchase and sell over 100 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, using various payment methods linked to their PayPal accounts.The company announced that MoonPay users in the U.S. can now complete fiat-to-crypto transactions through wallets, bank transfers, or debit cards using a PayPal account.Crypto Now Available To Moonpay US UsersThe integration signifies a notable development for MoonPay, as it became the first platform of its kind to incorporate PayPal. This provides a wider selection of cryptocurrencies compared to platforms that only offer Ether or the PayPal USD stablecoin.MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright highlighted the positive impact of the Moonpay Paypal integration on conversion rates.“Many traditional banks do not allow users to purchase crypto on debit/credit cards, but when users pay with PayPal, using that same card, we have already seen a dramatic increase in the success rate of transactions,” said Soto-Wright.With over 20 million verified users as of May 2024, he emphasized that the PayPal integration will initially be available through MoonPay’s direct-to-consumer products, including the MoonPay App and desktop.The integration is expected to commence with 50% of MoonPay’s customers and expand to other regions, including the United Kingdom and the European Union.Previously, PayPal users had access to a limited selection of digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, PayPal USD, and Bitcoin Cash. With the Moonpay PayPal partnership, however, users now have a broader range of options, including popular tokens like Solana (SOL), Tether (USDT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC).Additionally, MoonPay’s expansion aligns with its commitment to providing fiat-to-crypto transactions with debit and credit cards, mobile payment options like Apple and Google Pay, bank transfers, and local payment methods based on jurisdiction.The company seeks to expand this access to other regions, such as the United Kingdom and the European Union.Moonpay’s Strategic Partnerships Penetrating The Mainstream Market
MoonPay and Mastercard have also recently partnered to advance Web3 integrations, enhance marketing tools, and foster customer engagement.The collaboration sees Mastercard leveraging MoonPay’s web3 creative services — through Nightshift ( Now Otherlife), acquired last October—to modernize its marketing strategies and boost customer loyalty.MoonPay is integrating Mastercard’s solutions, such as Send, Crypto Credentials, and Click-to-Pay, into its services to ensure regulatory compliance and trustworthiness amid increasing regulatory scrutiny in the crypto market.Because of these regulatory troubles, MoonPay appointed Mike Lempres, a former executive from Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), to its board of directors last year amid increased regulatory scrutiny.Lempres, known for his extensive experience in corporate governance and regulatory affairs, brings valuable expertise to MoonPay as it explores product offerings and regulatory challenges.His previous roles at Coinbase, where he played a major role in the exchange’s IPO and growth, highlight his understanding of compliance and risk management in the crypto industry.

Economist Alex Krüger Goes ‘Max Long’ on Crypto Positions - Here Are His Altcoin Picks - The Daily Hodl


								Popular trader and economist Alex Krüger says he’s currently “max long” on the crypto market.
Krüger tells his 173,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s hedged and unhedged multiple times but he’s now max long in “very concentrated positions.”










The economist notes that he’s looking to “de-risk” soon. However, he acknowledges that Bitcoin (BTC) could drop as low as $52,000 after plunging below $59,000. BTC is trading at $57,093 at time of writing and is down more than 4.5% in the past 24 hours.
Explains Krüger,
“I’m not immune to bear raids. My bigger picture view has not changed: new ATHs later in the year (for Bitcoin). End-of-cycle views make little sense to me. A correction was to be expected.” 
The economist also notes that he has positions in the layer-1 blockchains Solana (SOL), Toncoin (TON), Aptos (APT) and Core (CORE), as well as the decentralized data storage protocol Arweave (AR) and Bittensor (TAO), a decentralized blockchain platform that focuses on machine learning and AI.
Krüger adds that APT, CORE, AR and TAO are “much higher risk” than SOL and TON.
The economist also notes that Bitcoin had a bearish response to Wednesday’s U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement.
“Very rare for price to reverse in full right after the press conference is over. And bearish, as the FOMC was dovish. And now you have trapped intraday longs. The one silver lining is BTC is trading in line with equities.”

Bitcoin: Longs erase $100M in 1 day, more to come for BTC's price? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin has dropped below the $60,000 price range.
More long positions have been liquidated in the last 48 hours.

The recent downturn in Bitcoin’s [BTC] price has left traders in long positions vulnerable. With BTC’s price declining further and crossing critical thresholds, many holders are liquidating their positions.
Bitcoin sees over $100 million in liquidations
According to data from Crypto Rank, the cryptocurrency market experienced liquidations totaling over $464 million on the 1st of May, and Bitcoin accounted for over $136 million of this outflow. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the Bitcoin liquidation chart on Coinglass indicated that long positions bore the brunt of the liquidations, with approximately $100.3 million being liquidated on the 1st of May. 
Conversely, short liquidations amounted to around $36.4 million. 
Source: Coinglass
On the 30th of April, long positions also faced more liquidations, with over $95 million being liquidated compared to approximately $18.4 million in short liquidations. 
According to Crypto Rank’s data, long liquidations represented over 80% of the total liquidations recorded on the 1st of May. 
As of the time of this writing, nearly $13 million had been liquidated in long positions, while short liquidations amounted to around $2 million.
More Bitcoin hits exchanges
AMBCrypto’s look at the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow indicated a notable increase in the number of assets being sent to exchanges, suggesting increased selling activity. The number stood at 1200 on the 1st of May. 
Source: CryptoQuant
Further analysis of the BTC flow revealed an inflow of over 32,300. These figures suggested an ongoing trend of increased BTC being sent to exchanges.
BTC in free fall

At the time of writing, BTC was trading at approximately $57,740, showing a less than 1% decline. This prolonged price decline has further entrenched a bearish trend, as indicated by its Relative Strength Index (RSI). 
The downward trajectory in price is also contributing to increased exchange inflow and liquidation of long positions.

Jack Dorsey’s Block to use 10% of Bitcoin profit to buy BTC every month

Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey said his fintech firm Block, Inc. will flip 10% of its gross profit made off its Bitcoin products into buying Bitcoin (BTC) every month.“Going forward, each month we will be investing 10% of our gross profit from Bitcoin products into Bitcoin purchases,” Dorsey wrote in a May 2 shareholder letter inclusive of its better-than-expected first-quarter results.“We were one of the first public companies to put Bitcoin on our balance sheet,” he added. Block bought $220 million worth of BTC across Q4 2020 and Q1 2021.“Our investment in Bitcoin transcends technology; it is an investment in a future where economic empowerment is the norm.”Its latest earnings detailed Block held 8,038 BTC as of March 31 — worth $573 million with reported paper gains of $233 million.Block’s Bitcoin gross profit for the first quarter of 2024 through customer sales with its Cash App business was up nearly 60% year-on-year to $80.1 million.

EigenLayer Increases Minimum Airdrop Allocation - The Defiant

More than 280,000 users of the restaking protocol will receive an additional 100 EIGEN tokens.Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer has updated its EIGEN airdrop allocations in response to severe community backlash.All eligible users will receive an additional 100 EIGEN tokens, provided that they interacted with EigenLayer before April 29.“We heard from many users worldwide who had to pay high gas costs to participate in the protocol. We want to ensure that users, small and large, have equal access,” the Eigen Foundation said in a blog post.The project has also outlined its timeline for unlocking EIGEN tokens, connecting this milestone to its goal of achieving mainnet launch by Sept. 30, at which point the community will be able to vote on enabling transferability.Additionally, the Foundation clarified that the 12-month lockup period for the team and investors will start only after the EIGEN token becomes transferable.EigenLayer is DeFi’s third-largest protocol, with $15 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. It enables users to re-stake their Ether or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to earn additional yield by securing third-party applications called Actively Validated Services (AVS).The update also addressed an oversight where certain testnet users were not allocated tokens. This will be corrected in Phase 2 of Season 1, with more information to be shared in the near future.

                        Iran and Russia are working on CBDC and “digital financial asset” (DFA)-powered trade solutions, an Iranian official has confirmed.Speaking to the Russian media outlet Izvestia, Rahimi Mohsen, the trade attaché of the Iranian Embassy in Russia, said that “nations” were “exploring the use of DFAs and central bank digital currencies.”Mohsen claimed that CBDC-powered “options” could “simplify trade” between Tehran and Moscow.Iran and Russia: ‘There’s a Need to Create Regulations for CBDC Trade’
The attaché stated that CBDCs, including the digital ruble and Iran’s project, the so-called crypto-rial, could “potentially mitigate the impact of sanctions.”Russia has been hit with multiple sanctions packages from the US, the EU, and allied nations since the outbreak of war in Ukraine in 2022.Iran, meanwhile, is facing fresh sanctions following a missile strike on Israel in mid-April, the UK government announced last week.Mohsen conceded that “difficulties remain” with CBDC-related payments, but said lawmakers would need to “create infrastructure and regulations for new payment methods.”He added that Iran “intends to cooperate with Russia” to “implement” new regulations, as “Tehran maintains an effective trade partnership with Moscow.”Sanctions packages are making Iran and Moscow “more interested than ever” in cooperating, claimed Maxim Chereshnev, the Chairman of Russia’s Council for the Development of Foreign Trade and International Economic Relations.Chereshnev added that a CBDC-powered “partnership” with Iran was “strategically important” to Moscow.The move could allow Moscow to “strengthen” its “influence in the Middle East and Central Asia,” he explained.Non-USD Fiat Trades Cost Russian Firms Dearly: Expert
The chairman added that the “inability to make payments in dollars and euros” has forced Russia and Iran to use their own fiat currencies in trade deals.But Chereshnev explained that this causes difficulties to arise when it comes to converting currencies.He added that there were also “discrepancies” between Iranian currency market rates and state-controlled rates.As such, Russian businesses currently lose “about 20-25%” in every trade deal they make using fiat.Chereshnev said that CBDCs would help alleviate this. He said that the “launch of settlements made using DFAs and CBDCs can “simplify trade between states” like Iran and Russia.He also said the tech advances would allow traders to “increase transparency, and boost the security of transactions.”More Russian Partners Ready for CBDC Trading?
Russian banks and other firms have begun issuing DFAs: blockchain-powered securities, commodities, and more; as they look to increase domestic investment options.Earlier this year, President Vladimir Putin signed a law that allows Russian firms to engage in cross-border DFA trade using Russian-issued tokens.The law also allows companies to trade cross-border using the digital ruble. However, experts have noted that this law does not allow Russian companies to use other countries’ DFAs or CBDCs in trade deals.Several other Russian allies have begun accelerating their own digital fiat projects. These include Belarus, which is set to make use of the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network.In February, Mikhail Demidenko, the National Bank of Belarus’s Deputy Head of Research and Strategic Development, said:“The [goal] is primarily the decentralization of cross-border payments. The problem in the modern world is that all payments between countries go through the banking systems of issuers of major currencies like the dollar and euro.”Russian lawmakers have also floated the idea of doing business with China using the digital ruble and the Beijing-backed digital yuan.

Ethereum Name Service challenges Unstoppable Domains' patent - Crypto Briefing




Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has petitioned the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to challenge the validity of a patent obtained by Unstoppable Domains (UD) in 2023. ENS claims that UD’s patent utilizes technology that ENS had developed and open-sourced.In a statement on social media platform X, ENS explained that UD obtained a patent for technology that ENS Labs developed with the intent of being open-source.Both ENS and UD provide domain name and wallet services with top-level domains (TLDs) such as .crypto, .eth, and similarly branded names that form an affinity with the crypto space. ENS alleges that UD patented “ENS’s pioneering technology, directly leveraging our open-source innovations” and that ENS’ contributions were even cited in the patent.“We gave UD every opportunity to avoid this battle: UD refused to open source the patent and refused to make any irrevocable pledges not to use the patent to the detriment of the community,” ENS stated.In response to the petition, Unstoppable Domains founder Matthew Gould stated on X that the patent was reviewed by the examiner with the citations to ENS in place. Gould argued that patents are valid and that “filing patents is very common in both web3 and the domain industry.”On this note, Nick Johnson, the lead developer of ENS, asked Gould to cite the key innovation in UD’s patent that wasn’t already part of ENS.At the time of writing, Gould is yet to reply to Johnson’s query, a lack of response for which the latter posted two cricket emojis.In his initial response to ENS’ thread, Gould argues that Unstoppable Domains has several other patents pending and will continue to file patents to “protect” the company. Gould also mentions that his company had made a non-assertion pledge over a year ago and views the issue as resolved.In July 2022, Unstoppable Domains raised $65 million in a Series A round led by Pantera Capital, sending the firm’s valuation to a unicorn status at $1 billion. ENS, on the other hand, operates based on a set of decentralized smart contracts for an open and public infrastructure.

Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF launch in ‘top 20%’, STRK scam suspect busted: Asia Express


            
Our weekly roundup of news from East Asia curates the industry’s most important developments.



Hong Kong spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFsdisappoint



Six Hong Kong spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs from three issuers have attracted a little over $200 million in assets under management (AUM) since their launch on April 30. This disappointed many whose expectations were set sky high due to the billions of dollars solicited by U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs within one week of their debut in January. 



“We tried to warn everyone to lower expectations re HK,” commented Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. 




“That said, if you localize numbers, this was BIG: e.g., ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF took in $123m on Day One, which already ranks it 6th of 82 ETFs launched in the past 3 yrs in HK and Top 20% overall.” 




Market participants were less impressed, however. At the time of publication, Bitcoin and Ether have lost 10% of their value within the past month. Data from Arkham Intelligence indicate that for two ETFs, the Bosera HashKey Bitcoin ETF and Bosera HashKey Ether ETFs, the AUM figures almost entirely stem from pre-listing subscriptions while trading volume post debut remains stunted. 



The result shouldn’t have come as a surprise. 



Due to capital restrictions, the Hong Kong crypto ETFs are only accessible to the 7.5 million residents of the city and some overseas traders. Mainland Chinese residents, who number over 1.4 billion, are barred from accessing the ETFs without prior Hong Kong residency. In addition, Hong Kong residents could already access the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs prior to the approval of the local ETFs. 






That said, not everyone is bearish on the ETFs’ prospects. According to a recent survey by Hong Kong crypto exchange OSL, 77% of crypto investors in the East Asian city plan to invest in the local spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. 



“This positive investor sentiment powerfully points to the growing acceptance and importance of digital assets in the region’s economy, and Hong Kong is once again marking its place as the digital asset hub,” wrote OSL’s executive director and head of regulatory affairs Gary Tiu. 



Likewise, Balchunas said in a follow-up post that the Hong Kong crypto ETFs’ performance was “way ahead of schedule,” with an AUM of $292 million on day one. The analyst previously set an AUM target of $1 billion within two years for the Hong Kong ETFs, which is still well below the tens of billions of dollars managed by U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Airdrop farmer busted by Chinese police 



Despite mostly outlawing cryptocurrencies, Chinese police have arrested an individual, known only as “Lan,” who allegedly impersonated a Starknet developer and fraudulently claimed 40,000 STRK, worth $120,000 at the time, from the Ethereum layer-two solution’s official airdrop. Authorities reported: “Recently, the Cyber Security Brigade of the Xiangyuan County Public Security Bureau received a report from a victim, claiming that the 40,000 STRK coins that he had contributed to the STRK official development program had been fraudulently claimed by others.”




“With the support of the Cyber Security Detachment of the Changzhi Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Xiangyuan Cyber Police based on relevant clues finally identified the coin theft suspect as Lan, a native of Meizhou, Guangdong Province.”

Lan, who appears to have publicly bragged about the airdrop theft on Twitter, stated that he first searched Starknet on Github, randomly “picked some co-contributors,” and finally “copy their name/efforts,” in the official Starknet airdrop claim form to receive STRK. Chinese police further stated: 




“He searched for relevant workload certificates submitted by others, impersonated other people’s identities and submitted more than 40 forms, and falsely claimed the funds. The victim’s 40,000 STRK coins were transferred to his OKX wallet, and then converted into 91,000 USDT coins (equivalent to more than 637,000 yuan) as his own.”




On Feb. 20, Starknet developers allocated approximately 700 million STRK tokens out of a total supply of 10 billion to reward Starknet developers, and users, Ethereum solo and liquid stakers, as well as projects and developers from outside the Web3 ecosystem. 



Despite prior warnings, accounts from airdrop farmers and copycat accounts were allegedly included in the official airdrop. The project has since surpassed a fully diluted market capitalization of $13 billion.

Binance shuts down Hong Kong-affiliated entity 



HKVAEX, a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange allegedly tied to Binance, has ceased operations as of May 1. 



“We have ceased the registration of new users and have discontinued all trading and deposit functions for existing users,” wrote HKVAEX staff. “Should you encounter any issues or require assistance, particularly after the platform is delisted, please do not hesitate to contact our support.”



Users who do not withdraw assets after the closure will be debited “a custodian fee of USDT 20 or the equivalent in other virtual assets” with weekly snapshots starting from May 1. 



A few months earlier, HKVAEX withdrew its application for a crypto exchange license in Hong Kong. X account Wu Blockchain speculated that the withdrawal may have involved various reasons, including a request to change the audit company or provide more information. The firm did not state an official reason for the withdrawal. 



End of an era for Binance



Changpeng Zhao, the iconic co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange Binance, has been sentenced to four months in prison after pleading guilty to one charge of money laundering. 



“I will do my time, conclude this phase and focus on the next chapter of my life,” the former blockchain executive wrote. “I will remain a passive investor (and holder) in crypto. Our industry has entered a new phase. Compliance is super important,” he added. 



Zhao a Chinese-born Canadian national, founded Binance in 2017 with his spouse Yi He, a Chinese television personality, after a brief stint as the CTO of crypto exchange OKCoin (now OKX). 



Under his leadership, Binance quickly becomes the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, with a market share of over 50%. The exchange pioneered features that are now prominent in the industry, such as swaps, earn, API bots, farm pools, initial offerings, NFT marketplaces, exchange self-custody wallets, and others. 



However, the exchange’s rapid growth came at the cost of failing to maintain an adequate compliance program. Last November, the exchange announced a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over money laundering charges. Zhao also stepped down as CEO as part of a plea deal. 



Binance’s new CEO, Richard Teng, has since stated that “gaps in compliance” from the early days of Binance are firmly in the past and that the crypto exchange is now “totally different.”

JPMorgan Waves Crypto Red Flag: Urges Caution As Market Teeters on Edge


								In recent evaluations by JPMorgan analysts, cryptocurrencies’ future appears to be uncertain. Despite the sector’s rapid expansion and increasing mainstream acceptance, the financial giant advises a cautious approach in the short term.
This conservative stance stems from “diminishing retail interest” and a “scarcity of positive market catalysts.”

Analyzing The Shifts: From Enthusiasm To Caution
JPMorgan’s scrutiny reveals a marked shift in market dynamics. Over recent weeks, significant selling and profit-taking activities have been observed, particularly from retail investors who seem to be retreating from crypto and equity markets.
According to JPMorgan analysts, this trend is corroborated by a notable decrease in net inflows to equity funds, turning negative for the first time since the bullish early quarter.
The analysis further points out that while spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have experienced outflows, retail enthusiasm for stocks has also fallen.
The caution advised by JPMorgan pivots around several critical observations:
• Market Exhaustion: The crypto markets are struggling with elevated positioning, Bitcoin’s high valuation compared to gold, and its production costs.
• Retail Deterioration: Retail investor interest is clearly waning, mirrored by reduced inflows into related assets.
• Institutional Hesitation: Institutional players, including commodity trading advisors and quantitative funds, are taking profits on their previously bullish positions, though at a scale lesser than anticipated.
The analysts noted:
With a lack of positive catalysts, with the retail impulse dissipating and with the three headwinds mentioned previously in our publication (elevated positioning, high bitcoin prices vs. gold and vs. the estimated bitcoin production cost, subdued crypto VC funding) still in place, we maintain a cautious stance on crypto markets over the near term.
Crypto Analyst Predictions Diverge
As JPMorgan adopts a conservative approach to cryptocurrency, other analysts provide more detailed forecasts, particularly for Bitcoin.
Michael van de Poppe, a well-regarded figure in crypto analysis, has suggested that Bitcoin might be nearing the conclusion of its corrective phase, indicating possible upward movements following the establishment of a price floor.

Conversely, Peter Schiff, a known Bitcoin skeptic and gold advocate, has entered the conversation about Bitcoin’s valuation, forecasting a potential decrease in the near term and setting his target at the $54,000 mark.

Meanwhile, despite a rough 7.8% decline over the past week, Bitcoin has shown signs of resilience. Recently, the cryptocurrency has experienced a modest recovery, increasing by 1.8% in a single day, bringing its price to $58,458.

Examining MATIC's future as Polygon records new ATH in key area - AMBCrypto



Polygon’s daily active addresses exceeded 1.4 million. 
MATIC’s price surged by more than 9% in the last 24 hours.

Polygon [MATIC] has been in the new for several weeks because of its high network activity. Things just got even better as a key metric hit an all-time high. 
In the meantime, MATIC’s price gained bullish momentum as the market condition changed.
Polygon’s network activity is rising 
Polygon has performed well in terms of network activity, as its daily active addresses have remained above the 1 million mark for multiple weeks. 
The consistency resulted in the metric touching a new all-time high on the 1st of May. 
According to a recent tweet from Today In Polygon, the blockchain’s daily active addresses touched 1.4 million. 
AMBCrypto’s look at Artemis’ data revealed that the massive rise in active addresses had a positive impact on its daily transactions, as it also surged.
Source: Artemis
Though the blockchain’s network activity was up, things were not good in terms of captured value. AMBCrypto found that while active addresses rose, its fees dropped sharply. 
Because of that, the blockchain’s revenue also declined. 
Polygon’s performance on the DeFi front was also not on par, which was evident from the drop in its TVL.

MATIC bulls are here
MATIC bulls stepped up their game as the token’s price chart turned green. According to CoinMarketCap, MATIC was up by more than 9% in the last 24 hours. 
At the time of writing, it was trading at $0.6944 with a market capitalization of over $6.8 billion. A possible reason behind this price pump could be a rise in buying pressure. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that MATIC’s supply on exchanges dipped.
 This happened at a time when its supply outside of exchanges increased, suggesting buying pressure on Polygon increased. 
Whales’ confidence in MATIC also seemed to have improved, as the supply held by top addresses went up slightly.

To see whether Polygon will manage to sustain this new bull rally, AMBCrypto then planned to take a look at its daily chart.
 We found that MATIC’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp uptick and was headed further above the neutral mark. Similar to the CMF, the Money Flow Index (MFI) also went northward.

Moreover, the technical indicator MACD displayed a bullish upperhand in the market. These technical indicators clearly suggested that the chances of MATIC remaining bullish were high.
 However, nothing can be said with certainty, as the Bollinger Bands pointed out that MATIC’s price was entering a less-volatile zone.

Fantom (FTM) Price Presents Early Buy Signals


Fantom (FTM) price has been consolidating for some time now and could continue. This is because the altcoin has not seen any strong directional bias in weeks.
However, a buy signal currently appears on the on-chain metrics, which could help FTM escape consolidation.
Buy Singlas Pop Up for Fantom
Fantom‘s price trading above $0.63 is a good sign that the altcoin is safe from diving further, as supported by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). This technical analysis tool measures the relationship between two moving averages of an asset’s price. It provides insight into its momentum and potential buy or sell signals. 
During recovery moments, the indicator line (blue) crosses over the signal line (red), confirming a bullish crossover. This is the expected outcome as these lines are inching closer. Once this happens, the Fantom’s price will be eligible for an increase.

Fantom also shows a divergence in the price daily active addresses (DAA) indicator. This can be seen as a buy signal, suggesting an ideal accumulation zone.
This metric is used in cryptocurrency analysis to assess the relationship between an asset’s price and the number of active addresses transacting on its network. It indicates potential discrepancies between market valuation and network usage trends.
Whenever the price of an asset rises and participation decreases, a sell signal can be observed. Conversely, increasing participation and declining prices issue a buy signal, which is the case with FTM presently. If investors opt to make the most of this opportunity and stock up on FTM supply, it could see some recovery soon.

FTM Price Prediction: Rebound

At $0.67 at the time of writing, Fantom’s price maintains its presence above the key support of $0.63. This support line has been tested numerous times this year and remained unbroken since early March.
Such is the case with the resistance block of $0.79 and $0.88 as well. This block has been tested as support and resistance and is usually difficult to breach through or below. 
Even if FTM does manage to post a rally in the next few trading sessions, it will halt the rise at $0.79, which is the lower limit of the resistance block. From there on, it is unclear whether to breach $0.80 or fail to do so.

However, if the support of $0.63 is broken, Fantom’s price could note a considerable drawdown. Falling to $0.55 and below would invalidate the bullish thesis, enabling FTM to note further losses.

3 May: Four Solana Memecoins That Could Skyrocket 9,000% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.







Market Cap: $3,000




Contract Address: Aeem6NMbRzcLCFxJWCYWatevYLEKEi1P1YkkYJv7dgUd







Market Cap: $16,000



Contract Address: 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML







Market Cap: $15,000




Contract Address: 37Tfn3F5E84KvitHHQVK37KzZZ3qAPCdxjGgBJd8XoVs







Market Cap: $19,000



Contract Address: AiqeRZVZgPkDVVXNTYqz7xGA7bgwuTgE1ShqCkC7C7Em



How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

SEC will classify ETH as security and reject spot Ethereum ETFs, says Michael Saylor - Crypto Briefing




Michael Saylor believes that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will label Ethereum as a security this summer and consequently deny all spot Ethereum ETF applications. He also claimed that other major cryptos like Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) will likely face similar security classifications from the SEC.“Ethereum is deemed to be a crypto asset security, not a commodity. After that, you’re gonna see that Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano, everything down the stack is just crypto-asset securities unregistered,” said Saylor during today’s presentation at the MicroStrategy World 2024 conference.“None of them will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF. None of them will be accepted by Wall Street. None of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets,” he added.In contrast, Saylor highlighted Bitcoin’s unique position as the only crypto asset with full institutional acceptance, describing it as the “one universal” institutional-grade crypto asset without any contenders.MicroStrategy’s founder is known as a vocal Bitcoin proponent; he exclusively focuses on Bitcoin investment and building Bitcoin infrastructure.Saylor’s comments come a day after MicroStrategy unveiled MicroStrategy Orange, a Bitcoin-based decentralized identity solution. Earlier this week, the company also announced its acquisition of 122 BTC last month.Mounting skepticismSaylor is not the only person who is skeptical about the near-term approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. Justin Sun, the founder of TRON Foundation, previously voiced concerns about Ethereum ETF’s regulatory hurdles. He believes the SEC will not approve spot Ethereum ETFs this month.The SEC is set to make decisions on filings by VanEck and ARK on May 23 and May 24, respectively. Recent discussions surrounding the SEC’s approval process for spot Bitcoin funds have been notably shallow compared to prior discussions preceding the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin funds, with SEC staff reportedly not engaging in detailed conversations about the proposed Ethereum ETFs.This lack of interaction heightens frustration and raises the chances of either a rejection or a postponement of decisions.A definitive classification for Ethereum could clarify how companies interact with the asset. It could also influence the SEC’s approval of products like spot ETFs and the willingness of companies to engage with Ethereum.However, not everyone shares this doubt. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on the Fox Business show “The Claman Countdown” that a spot Ethereum ETF could still be possible even if the SEC classifies ETH as a security.

Shiba Inu: ShibaSwap to operate on Ethereum, Solana: Impact on SHIB? - AMBCrypto



ShibaSwap’s 24-hour trading volume more than doubled. 
Ecosystem tokens like SHIB and BONE saw impressive spikes in the last 24 hours.

In a major feat for the Shiba Inu [SHIB] ecosystem, decentralized exchange (DEX) ShibaSwap went live on the layer-2 (L2) blockchain Shibarium, ushering in a new multichain era.
The update was provided by Shiba Inu marketing lead Lucie via an X post dated the 1st of May. With the integration, Shibaswap would operate on both the Ethereum [ETH] and Shibarium networks.
The ecosystem’s primary token SHIB was trading at $0.00002245 as of this writing, up 6.4% in the last 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap showed.
Bone ShibaSwap [BONE], ShibaSwap’s governance token, also got a 5.76% hike in the 24-hour period.
Big boost for ShibaSwap
Since its launch in July 2021, ShibaSwap has been functioning on the Ethereum blockchain as a DEX, offering services like staking, liquidity pools, and yield farming.
The platform has handled trades worth more than $17 billion as of this writing, AMBCrypto noted using DeFiLlama data. In the last 24 hours, the trading volume more than doubled to $2.55 million.
Shibarium was due for a hard fork on the 2nd of May, in a bid to make the network faster and more cost-effective.
The improved network performance could provide just the right ecosystem for ShibaSwap to grow further.
What’s in there for SHIB?
Utility projects like ShibaSwap and Shibarium were planned steps by the Shiba Inu ecosystem to rise above the meme coin status and add utility to native tokens.
The news of Shibarum’s integration not only caused SHIB to spike, but resulted in a dramatic increase in the new addresses created on the network, AMBCrypto noted using Santiment data.

The daily active addresses also spiked 11% on the 1st of May. The positive commentary around the coin also increased, as evidenced by the weighted sentiment indicator.
Like the broader market, the second-largest meme coin had a rough April, losing more than 12% throughout the month.

Bitcoin Loses Historical Level, Analyst Says "Reclaim And Bounce, Or Die"


                            An analyst has pointed out how Bitcoin recently closed below a historically important on-chain level, a failure to reclaim which could spell trouble for BTC.
Bitcoin Fell Below Short-Term Holder Cost Basis In Latest Crash
In a new post on X, Maartunn discussed BTC’s recent close below the realized price of the short-term holders and stressed its importance in reclamation.
The “realized price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that tracks the price at which the average investor on the Bitcoin network acquired their coins. In other words, it measures the average cost basis in the BTC market.

When the spot value of a cryptocurrency is below this metric, it means that the average investor in the market is carrying their coins at a loss right now. On the other hand, being above the indicator suggests that the holders as a whole are in the green currently.
In the current topic, the realized price of the entire Bitcoin market isn’t of interest but rather of only a subsection: the short-term holders (STH).
The STHs are the BTC investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. These holders represent the inconsistent side of the market, who easily show a reaction whenever a change like a crash or rally occurs in the sector.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the realized price specifically for these investors over the past year:

The price of the asset appears to have seen a cross under this metric in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
The realized price of the Bitcoin STHs is floating around $58,500. During the latest crash, Bitcoin went as low as below $57,000, meaning that the plunge has put these investors under pressure.
Historically, the average cost basis of the STHs has been significant for the cryptocurrency, as it has taken turns acting as support and resistance, depending on the market’s phase.
During bullish trends, this metric often acts as a point of support. The chart shows that when Bitcoin had declined near this level earlier in the year, it had found a rebound.
The metric acts as resistance during bear markets, keeping the price below it. These patterns may be related to how investor psychology works.

In bullish periods, the STHs might view their cost basis as a profitable buying opportunity, so they accumulate during dips in it, thus helping the price turn around. In bear markets, these investors could look at the level as a point of exit, as they may not believe the price will go up any further.
After closing below the STH realized price earlier, Bitcoin is now fighting to reclaim this historical level. It now remains to be seen if support will once again be found or if the level will truly become lost.
BTC Price
Bitcoin has climbed back above the STH realized price, trading above $59,300. This is certainly a sign in the positive direction, but it’s hard to say whether this recovery will last.

Bitcoin Analyst Is Long On King Crypto As Fed Moves To Unwind Treasury Buybacks: 'QE Is CLose' - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD analyst Michael van de Poppe takes a bullish stance on the cryptocurrency as the Federal Reserve begins unwinding Treasury buybacks, signaling a potential shift in monetary policy.What Happened: Van de Poppe took to social media platform X, to share his concerns. He pointed out that the FED’s decision to unwind Treasury buybacks and reduce QT is a response to worsening economic data, which increases the likelihood of a recession. He suggested that this could become evident in the upcoming months and advised investors to consider long-term investments in Bitcoin.He wrote, “Casually, the FED starts to unwind Treasury buybacks and is reducing QT. Why? Well, the economic data starts to become worse, which means the chances of a potential recession have increased. Likely this will pop up coming months in the data. Long #Bitcoin, QE is close.”Quantitative easing is a monetary policy used by central banks to increase liquidity in the financial system, typically by purchasing long-term government bonds from major banks. This is done to stimulate economic growth by encouraging banks to lend or invest more freely.See Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Closing April With Heavy Losses, Slide Below $60K Causes Over $380M In LiquidationsWhy It Matters: Van de Poppe’s warning comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant fluctuations.

His recent warning about a potential recession adds another layer of uncertainty to the market.Meanwhile, other analysts have been sharing their views on Bitcoin’s future. DonAlt, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, pointed out that despite bearish price action on lower time frames, the outlook remains bullish as long as Bitcoin closes above $60,000 on the weekly timeframe. Meanwhile, Peter Schiff sees Bitcoin in a bear market despite the hype surrounding spot Bitcoin ETFs. He compared Bitcoin’s performance to gold and pointed out that Bitcoin's previous support level of $60,000 now acts as resistance.On the other hand, Bitcoin is battling to reclaim some levels as Solana and meme coins lead the market rebound. This follows a period of losses earlier in the week, with Bitcoin open interest dropping to its lowest levels in two months.Van de Poppe had earlier projected a prolonged recovery period for Bitcoin while anticipating a surge in altcoin performance.Price Action: Bitcoin is presently trading at $59,009, marking a slight 0.10% decline over the last 24 hours.

Crypto Mining Restrictions: Arkansas Lawmakers Approve Bills


								Over the last couple of years, the US government has tried to tighten its grip on different sectors of the crypto industry. As a result, these efforts have received significant backlash from politicians and central figures within the crypto space.
This week, another crackdown on the crypto industry occurred after Arkansas lawmakers approved two bills to address criticism over previous regulations on mining operations.

New Crypto Mining Regulations In Arkansas
News media outlet The Associated Press (AP) reported on Wednesday that Arkansas’ House of Representatives gave final approval to two bills related to crypto mining operations in the state.
The two Senate-backed bills, SB78 and SB79, were among the few non-budget subjects on the legislative session’s agenda and were “overwhelmingly approved” by the majority Republican House. They are on their way to Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders’s desk.
Last year, Arkansas lawmakers faced backlash after approving the Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023. The approved Act 851 set an overall favorable regulatory ground for crypto miners in the state, establishing clear definitions and guidelines.
As Bitcoinist reported, the act included provisions prohibiting discrimination against digital asset miners. Moreover, it sought to protect crypto mining businesses from “discriminatory regulations” and ensure their equal treatment as data centers.
Act 851 was criticized for limiting the local government’s ability to enact measures to regulate mining businesses. Now, Arkansas’ Senate and House of Representatives intend to address the complaints of last year’s Act with the newly approved bills.
These bills tackle the backlash from local officials and residents who live near the operations, who complained about the noise impact on the community. As a result, the lawmakers added the requirement for noise-reduction techniques and a state permit to operate.
Additionally, the two bills addressed water usage restrictions for cooling techniques and removed the limitation to regulate the sound decibels generated by mining facilities. Republican Representative Rick McClure stated:

Let’s do what we can to help those who have been impacted in a negative way, and work for better solutions.

Moreover, the approved bills prohibit the ownership of crypto mining businesses by companies and individuals from several countries, including China.
Nonetheless, it continues to restrict the regulatory power of local authorities over matters like home mining from individuals or rezoning areas where crypto mining businesses are located.
Gov. Sanders To Sign The Bills Despite Concerns
According to AP, one of the Representatives who voted against the bills, democrat Andrew Collins, stated his concern about the wording of the limit and the impact it could have on foreign investment:

We’re casting a net that is both too wide and too narrow. It’s going to catch people up who are totally innocent, and it’s going to miss a lot of people who are either home-grown or are from countries not on this list.

Representative Justin Gonzalez also voted against the bills. During an interview on Wednesday, he expressed his opinion on the matter. To the representative, the bills will “allow local governments to discriminate against a business just because of what it is.”
According to Arkansas Advocate reports, Gonzales doesn’t believe the Act needed to be amended despite not having a problem with the language used to address the foreign ownership issue.
Regardless of the opposition concerns, the bills are expected to be approved by the Arkansas governor. Alexa Henning, Sanders’ spokesperson, stated in an email that both bills will be signed, further alleging adding that:

The Governor was the first in the country to kick a Chinese communist owned company out of her state and strongly supports outlawing foreign adversaries from owning crypto mines in Arkansas, while protecting rural communities and empowering them to crack down on bad actors.

TON Price Soars 9% On Pantera Capital's Investment, Capitalizing On Telegram User Potential


                            Venture capital firm Pantera Capital has invested significantly in The Open Network blockchain. The news, announced on Thursday, resulted in a 9% surge in the network’s native token, Toncoin (TON), pushing its value above the $5 mark.
Pantera Capital Bullish On TON And Telegram Integration
In a statement, Pantera Capital expressed enthusiasm about their latest investment in TON. The Layer 1 network, initially conceived by Telegram and continued by the open-source community, can potentially introduce cryptocurrency to the masses due to its extensive usage within the Telegram network. 

Telegram, used by over 900 million monthly active users, is known for personal and group communication, community building, content sharing, and more. Pantera Capital believes that by leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and user experience, combined with TON’s growing ecosystem, the network could become one of the largest in the cryptocurrency space. Pantera’s announcement further reads:
We at Pantera Capital are thrilled to announce our latest investment in TON, a Layer 1 network originally designed by Telegram and continued by the open-source community.  We believe TON has the capacity to introduce crypto to the masses because it is used extensively within the Telegram network. 
The integration of TON with Telegram aligns with the platform’s vision of providing a “seamless” and “borderless” experience for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments within its user base. 
Tether’s Integration With The Open Network
As previously reported by NewsBTC, Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin in the market, USDT, recently announced the launch of its USDT dollar-pegged token and Tether Gold (XAUT) on The Open Network. 
This integration further increases the potential for P2P payments within Telegram’s extensive user base, a prospect that Pantera Capital aims to capitalize on.

In addition to the investment in TON, Pantera Capital is actively pursuing the launch of a new fund, Pantera Fund V, to raise over $1 billion. This fund aims to provide investors with diverse investment options across the blockchain asset spectrum, encompassing startup equity, early-stage tokens, and liquid tokens.
The new fund has established a minimum investment threshold of $1 million for qualified investors, and the first close is scheduled for April 1, 2025. 
Insiders familiar with the matter have indicated that Pantera Fund V is anticipated to reach a similar size as its predecessor, which successfully amassed approximately $1.25 billion in capital two years ago.

Following the disclosure of Pantera Capital’s investment in The Open Network, the price of TON experienced a notable 9% surge on Thursday, reaching a current trading price of $5.09. This increase comes after a significant price decline, with TON dropping as low as $4.6 after reaching its all-time high (ATH) of $7.65 in mid-April.

As Bitcoin sinks below this key zone, what should you do now? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin short-term whales are underwater, which likely presented an ideal buying opportunity
Metrics resembled how they were before the previous major bull run

Bitcoin [BTC] sank below the key demand zone at $60k.
This region had held the sellers at bay but eventually gave way. Crypto technical analyst CrypNuevo highlighted that we might get a post-FOMC bounce to $61k in a post on X (formerly Twitter).
Should traders expect to see the $60k former support reclaimed? Alternatively, should they look to go short upon a retest? Here’s what market participants could watch out for before making their next move.
The current breakdown has been on a high trading volume
Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView
The key levels are $59.4k and $60.7k in the short term. A cluster of liquidity is likely present near these levels, marking them as critical areas where a bearish continuation could occur.
Such a continuation is expected because the OBV has fallen below two-week support, highlighting selling pressure dominance.

The liquidation levels showed that the cumulative liq levels delta was vastly negative. Therefore, we can expect a move upward in the short-term to collect liquidity and wipe out the imbalance.
The $60.5k and the $63.8k levels had the highest cluster of liquidation levels. Hence, a move to these levels before a reversal southward is anticipated.
Of golden and death crosses

In a CryptoQuant Insights post, user CoinLupin pointed out an interesting development.
Looking at the realized UTXO age bands, the onset of major bull runs came when the realized price of 1-3 month and 2-3 year bands saw a smoothing process.
This happened in 2020 from January to September, and prices tend to consolidate near the realized prices of these age bands.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

In the current cycle, there were not as many golden and death crosses between these two age bands.
However, the recent pullback could be followed by deeper losses as savvy market participants buy from impatient BTC sellers. This could be followed by the true bull run, the analyst pointed out.

US senators, FBI aren’t opposed to crypto privacy: Railgun contributor

United States senators and intelligence agencies may not be as opposed to privacy-focused crypto protocols as some believe, according to Railgun researcher and advocate Alan Scott Jr. Speaking to Cointelegraph at ETH Global in Sydney on May 2, Scott — a contributor and public advocate for Railgun — said based on conversations he’s had with senators and the FBI in Washington D.C., he hasn’t seen any hints of a crypto privacy crusade on Capitol Hill. There are many people in the upper echelons of government who are “generally smart, want to do right, and protect people,” he said.Railgun is a privacy-focused protocol that leverages smart contracts to ensure private transactions for decentralized finance (DeFi) users on the Ethereum network and several of its layer-2 networks including Polygon and Arbitrum. Audience at the ETH Global conference in Sydney. Source: CointelegraphHowever, Railgun is often lumped in the same boat as other crypto privacy protocols, such as Tornado Cash, which has seen the wrong end of the law in recent years. On April 17, an  X account touting itself as the official account for Railgun denied being used by North Korea and other U.S.-sanctioned entities to launder ill-gained crypto — specifically referring to an FBI statement that claimed Railgun was used to launder more than $60 million in Ether (ETH) during the 2022 Harmony bridge exploit. Railgun said its zk-proof tech and “Private Proofs of Innocence” systems prevent bad actors from utilizing its protocol. Scott said crypto users should remember the FBI is a large multifaceted organization and that the people he’d spoken to at the bureau were less concerned with privacy protocols and more concerned with bad actors looking to commit financial crimes. “Their concern is the potential problems around impeding their ability to catch bad actors.” “Which is a great thing for them to be concerned with,” Scott said, explaining earlier that other privacy technology such as Scott said that his conversations with politicians and regulators in the U.S. had been largely positive and that many of them seemed to be genuinely trying their best to understand the new developments in crypto more broadly. “Whenever we talk about crypto, or we talk about DeFi you know, they ask well-informed questions and try to understand what the tech is like, how it operates, and why people like us like it so much,” he said. On April 24, the co-founders of the crypto mixer and Bitcoin wallet Samourai Wallet were arrested on money laundering charges, with the Department of Justice (DOJ) alleging the platform handled $2 billion in unlawful transactions and facilitated $100 million in money laundering transactions. Related: DOJ’s Tornado Cash arguments show ‘obvious disdain for privacy’ — LawyerScott added that despite these actions against mixers like Samourai Wallet and the ongoing persecution of Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm, there didn’t seem to be a crusade against the concept of privacy in crypto more broadly. “What [Railgun} is building is the disintermediation of finance, and DeFi is really quite a beautiful and very important thing to do.”“Privacy is a keystone element of that. So while we’re advocating for it and being loud and talking about privacy as an important thing — it’s completely normal, and it's actually quite boring,” Scott said. “It's already a part of the traditional finance that exists today.”He added that if the concept and application of privacy in crypto were to become illegal, it would be extremely unfortunate. “It just means we created a really hyper-accurate surveillance machine that can be monitored in live time.”Magazine: Lazarus Group’s favorite exploit revealed — Crypto hacks analysis

Bitcoin Mimics 2016 Pattern: Analyst Suggests Price Dip May Be Temporary pen_spark | Cryptoglobe


                                
A popular cryptocurrency analyst has recently identified possible parallels between the current price movements of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) and its 2016 bull run, even after a recent price correction.



According to pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin’s price action has been mirroring its 2016 cycle, with further declines observed in the weeks following the halving event. This recent dip falls within a zone dubbed the “Post-Halving Danger Zone” by the analyst, aligning with a similar price trend seen in 2016.



The analysis, shared with Rekt Capital’s over 450,000 followers on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), highlights that during the 2016 cycle, Bitcoin experienced an 11% price drop roughly three weeks after the halving. Rekt Capital suggested that the current cycle might see similar downside volatility within the next few days. This window coincides with the remaining period of the “Post-Halving Danger Zone.”







The analyst also drew attention to the pre-halving price movements in both 2016 and 2024. After breaking out of a consolidation phase, Bitcoin witnessed a pre-halving rally in both cycles that was then followed by a retracement period around four weeks before the halving event.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

While the initial downward movement in the 2016 retracement was short-lived, Rekt Capital emphasizes the importance of Bitcoin maintaining a price level above $60,000 to potentially avoid a similar extended decline.



Bitcoin is at the time of writing trading at $59,170 after dropping below the $57,000 mark earlier this week amid an aggressive cryptocurrency market sell-off. Notably, the recently launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded outflows amid the sell-off.



Nevertheless BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe whose asset management arm has over $600 billion in assets under management, has gained exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin via these funds.

Traders turn to tools such as DEXScreener as they hunt for top crypto gainers today in the on-chain markets / Source: Cryptonews
                        As blue-chip cryptos stabilize following a tumble earlier this week, with Bitcoin (BTC) consolidating below $60,000, traders are turning to the on-chain markets as they hunt for top crypto gainers today.Bitcoin was last trading close to $59,000 as traders digest recent macro developments. Negative ETF flows are also on the radar after BlackRock’s IBIT saw its first outflows since its January launch.Meanwhile, most major altcoins are also consolidating in wake of recent sell pressure.Downbeat conditions in the blue-chip market is encouraging traders turn to the volatile, unpredictable on-chain markets.On-chain markets refer to the market for assets that were issued and trade directly on the blockchain.Dozens of new tokens are launched every single day. Most are pump-and-dump schemes or scams. But there are some gems to be uncovered, that could hand an early investor quick 10 or even 100x gains.Traders often refer to tools like DEXScreener to locate trending and pumping coins.That being said, here are some of the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum, as per DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayCrypto Felon (FELON)A just-launched shitcoin called Crypto Felon (FELON) has seen a huge 72,000% pump since its launch.That’s according to DEXScreener, which puts its market cap at $2.2 million. The token also has $170,000 in locked liquidity.Somewhat surprisingly given the token is literally called Crypto Felon, it only has one smart contract issue.But traders should assume that all newly launched tokens are scams and always tread with caution.Yield (YIELD)Another just launched shitcoin called Yield (YIELD) is up over 48,000% in 24 hours.DEXScreener puts its market cap at $2.2 million, with just over $200,000 in locked liquidity.Traders should be extra careful with this shitcoin. It has five smart contract issues, including a modifiable tax and unrenounced ownership.Book of Bitcoin (BOOB)Following the success of the meme coin Book of Ethereum, a new token Book of Bitcoin (BOOB) has launched, with the added bonus of boasting a comical ticker.BOOB’s market cap was last $1.1 million, having rallied 29,000% in 24 hours as per DEXScreener.The token has $120,000 in locked liquidity and only one issue with its smart contract, a whitelist.Traders should be aware of the fact that its official X account has been suspended, never a good sign.Alternative Investment Strategy to Consider – Presales
If traders can reliably identify shitcoin gems, they can make a lot of money.But the over-looked strategy of investing in presales can potentially net even higher gains if executed correctly.Web3 projects/protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to fund development.If investors can reliably identify projects that, thanks to their strong vision, use case and competent team, end up gaining traction in the market, they can make big profits.Knowing where to start is one of the biggest barriers to entry in the daunting presale market.That’s why Cryptonews put together a list of their top picks.20 Best Crypto Presales to Invest InAlternatively, check out this video from Cryptonews’ Crypto Arjay, who goes over his top 3 meme coins.

                        Neo Price Prediction as NEO Token Slips 2.3% Despite Market Rebound – Can NEO Reach $20? / Source: TradingViewThe Neo (NEO) price is in focus as the cryptocurrency slips despite a broader market rebound, and as it tests a key medium-term uptrend.NEO was last changing hands just above $16, having traded as low as $15.35 on Wednesday.Neo is a smart contract blockchain that was launched back in 2014, before rebranding to the name Neo in 2017.As per CoinMarketCap, its market cap was last just over $1.1 billion.Despite its age, Neo has failed to catch on like other smart contract blockchains like Ethereum.Indeed, it has never been able to recover to the record high it hit near $200 in 2018.At the peak of the 2021 bull run, it only managed to briefly surpass $140.At current levels, it remains close to 90% down from these highs, and 92% down from its 2018 highs.NEO’s lack of adoption is evident when examining the trade value locked (TVL) in its smart contracts.As per DeFi Llama, its TVL was last only $63 million, giving it a paltry ranking of 62nd in crypto.A low TVL suggests the blockchain has failed to develop sufficiently useful/attractive DeFi protocols to attract investors.That a chain with such weak adoption can achieve a market cap of over $1 billion shows how irrational crypto markets can be.But Neo might not have a $1 billion market cap for long. Indeed, the Neo price appears to be on the verge of a bearish technical breakout that could see it quickly shed 40% of its value.Neo Price Prediction – Can NEO Reach $20?
NEO has been moving higher according to an uptrend since the January lows.But this uptrend looks like it’s about to break. And that could open the door to a drop all the way back to $10.The Neo (NEO) price is in focus as the cryptocurrency slips despite a broader market rebound, and as it tests a key medium-term uptrend. Source: TradingViewBroader crypto market conditions could well remain bearish in wake of Bitcoin’s recent drop under $60,000.Spot Bitcoin ETF demand has flipped net negative, with the ETF experiencing outflows for the past five days.Notably, BlackRock saw its first day of outflows on Wednesday. Outflows come as markets price out near-term rate cuts from the Fed.The Fed emphasized that its too early to be cutting rates on Wednesday. That’s due to recent upside surprises in the inflation data, and amid ongoing strong growth.Rate cuts aren’t now expected until late Q3/Q4 this year. Post-having tailwinds, a more positive macro picture and potentially post-election bullishness could then come in to lift risk appetite.But until then, cryptos like NEO could continue to perform poorly.Can NEO recover to $20? Well, in time and as sentiment improves, that shouldn’t be hard.Given the current token supply of 70.5 million, NEO’s market cap would only be $1.4 billion at this price.Irrationality could yet see NEO pump back towards its previous record peaks above $100.But traders should remember, NEO is a risky bet. Despite being around now for 10 years, it hasn’t shown any real signs of adoption.Its unlikely to become a big success story any time soon.Crypto Alternative to Consider – WienerAI (WAI)
Investors tempted to jump into a risky, speculative coin like NEO obviously have a high-risk tolerance.This appetite towards risk might be better served with a different strategy that, while also risky, has higher upside potential.The strategy in question is presale investing, which involves buying the tokens of upstart crypto projects before they gain traction.Presale investing is risky because projects can fail to deliver on their promises or achieve adoption.But if investors are able to reliably identify high-potential projects, they can bag big gains.A fun new AI meme coin called Wiener AI (WAI) has caught the attention of analysts at Cryptonews.The Sausage dog-themed meme coin offers a suite of handy AI trading capabilities and has already raised over $800,000.Interested investors need to move quickly, as when the presale reaches $1.1 million, the WAI price will rise.Currently priced at $0.000703, investors are buying WAI at a market cap of around $45 million.But investors could be looking at gains of 10x or more if WAI can become a market leader.Not only is WAI an exciting meme coin with AI capabilities, but its also a passive income gem.20% of the supply has been allocated to staking rewards. Presale investors are currently earning a massive 1091% APY.At this rate, investors can double their initial presale investment in under one month.Buy Wiener AI Here

Jack Dorsey's Block Will DCA Into Bitcoin Every Month


In the early morning of today’s Asia time, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Block Inc., revealed the company’s latest plan. Dorsey stated that it intends to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) monthly, utilizing the dollar-cost averaging (DCA) method.
This move highlights Block’s commitment to integrating Bitcoin into its financial strategy. Moreover, it also emphasizes Dorsey’s position as a prominent “Bitcoin maximalist.”
Details of Block’s Bitcoin DCA Strategy Unveiled
Dollar-cost averaging is an investment approach where the same dollar amount is invested in a particular asset at regular intervals regardless of the asset’s price fluctuations. This method helps reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase.
Hence, companies with Bitcoin holdings, like Block, can strategically navigate Bitcoin’s volatile nature using DCA. Furthermore, this approach offers the potential to achieve a lower average cost per share over time.

Read more: What Is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)?
Block provided further details on how they will implement the DCA strategy in its official statement. The company announced it will allocate 10% of its gross profits from Bitcoin-related products towards monthly purchases of Bitcoin.

“Under the DCA program, we plan to purchase Bitcoin on a monthly cadence, starting April 2024. We will execute these over a shorter time window due to lower notional trade values and improved Bitcoin liquidity compared to 2020 and 2021. To reduce slippage, we have chosen to purchase Bitcoin over a two-hour window that has historically had the greatest amount of liquidity,” the company explained.

The shift to a Bitcoin-centric portfolio isn’t new for Block. The company made headlines in October 2020 when it purchased 4,709 BTC at an average price of $10,618 per Bitcoin.
Subsequent investments in February 2021 saw the addition of 3,318 BTC at a much higher price point of $51,236 each. As of March 31, 2024, Block acknowledged owning 8,038 BTC on the company’s balance sheet.

These early investments have proven lucrative. At the same reporting period, Block claimed its initial $233 million investment in Bitcoin had ballooned to approximately $573 million, marking a 146% increase. The remeasurement gain from its $233 million Bitcoin investment contributed to its net income in the first quarter of 2024.

Block’s involvement in the Bitcoin ecosystem has significantly evolved beyond acquisitions. It recently launched a “Bitcoin Conversions” feature for Square users.
This feature allows merchants to convert a portion of their sales directly into Bitcoin, enhancing the utility of Block’s services in the crypto sector. Jack Dorsey explained the rationale behind this strategic direction in a recent letter to investors.


“We believe the world needs an open protocol for money, one that is not owned or controlled by any entity … An open protocol for money helps us serve more people around the world faster,” Dorsey stated.

BTC price chart seen mirroring US spot Bitcoin ETF launch pattern

Bitcoin (BTC) recent decline has some similarities to its behavior post-United States ETF launch in January, with one trader suggesting that this could mean an upswing in the “next week or so.” Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) were launched in Hong Kong on April 30, seeing $217 million worth of net inflows since. However, the price of Bitcoin has fallen almost 7% since launch, according to CoinMarketCap data.WhereAt Social co-founder and crypto trader Quinten Francois suggested the behavior bears similarities to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, which saw the price of Bitcoin fall 14% within 12 days of launch, before rising 7% over the following seven days. If Bitcoin’s price continues to follow the same trend it could see an upswing in the “next week or so,” according to Francois in a May 1 post on X.“There is no straight line to the top. Price correction was more than needed,” added pseudonymous crypto trader StockLizard.Source: Quinten FrancoisHowever, there are some key differences between the two launches. While Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs have seen $217 million worth of net inflows since launching, U.S. ETFs experienced $794 million in outflows over the same period.The Hong Kong-based ETFs also accumulated only $12.4 million in trading volume on their first day, a major difference from the $4.6 billion first-day trading volume of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs.Hong Kong’s ETF launch also comes just after the Bitcoin halving — which often comes with a period of “sideways” price action — along with continued heightened tensions in the Middle East and the United States Federal Reserve extending its period of interest rates within the nation.However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas argued in an April 30 post on X that this is a high figure considering the size of Hong Kong is approximately “1/168th the size of the U.S.” Some traders are concerned that inflows from Hong Kong might not be sufficient to offset the large amount of recent outflows from the U.S., potentially preventing a similar breakout pattern.“Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs are not enough to absorb US ETF selling pressure,” Crypto trading team TOBTC stated in a May 2 post on X.Related: Analysts expect Bitcoin price recovery after Fed leaves rates unchangedMeanwhile, other traders believe that the recent price decline is a healthy market correction for Bitcoin’s price.“The longer theBitcoin consolidation takes the higher its price will meet the trendline,” crypto trader Titan of Crypto stated in a post on X.“Bitcoin’s most recent correction was much needed for price going forward,” added crypto commentator CryptoCon.“The thing Bitcoin critics don’t understand is that we simply don’t care if the price drops,” echoed founder of AirBtc Handre van Heerden.Magazine: Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF launch in ‘top 20%’, STRK scam suspect busted: Asia ExpressThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Trezor to end privacy-enhancing coinjoin feature as Wasabi Wallet steps back - Crypto Briefing




Crypto hardware wallet manufacturer Trezor announced today the discontinuation of the coinjoin feature in its Trezor Suite. The service, provided in partnership with zkSNACKs, the developer of the Wasabi Wallet, will cease by June. Despite the shutdown, Trezor assures users that funds within Coinjoin accounts will remain accessible.Coinjoin is a privacy tool for Bitcoin transactions, allowing users to obscure the origins and destinations of their funds. Trezor was the first hardware wallet to embrace coinjoin transactions. It integrated coinjoin feature into the Trezor Model T in April last year and extended the implementation to the Trezor Model One later in August.zkSNACKs, in a recent blog post, expressed the decision to end its coinjoin coordination service was made with a “heavy heart” and a need for “legal clarity.” The company said Wasabi Wallet will still offer robust privacy features, such as client-side filtering and Tor integration, even without coinjoin.The move follows zkSNACKs’ decision to block US citizens and residents from accessing its services, including Wasabi Wallet, due to recent regulatory pressures. This prohibition extends to related websites and services, with IP address blocking already in effect.Non-custodial crypto service providers face legal showdownPhoenix, another crypto wallet provider, recently announced it would exit the US market due to ongoing regulatory uncertainties. Users are advised to close their channels and transfer their funds before access is terminated on May 5, 2024.“Recent announcements from U.S. authorities cast a doubt on whether self-custodial wallet providers, Lightning service providers, or even Lightning nodes could be considered Money Services Businesses and be regulated as such,” Acinq, the Bitcoin company behind Phoenix explained its decision.The exodus follows the SEC’s recent crackdown on non-custodial wallet provider Samourai Wallet and growing scrutiny over MetaMask. The SEC reportedly issued a Wells Notice to Consensys, MetaMask’s parent company. This notice serves as a preliminary warning that the SEC is considering legal action.In response, Consensys filed a lawsuit against the SEC, choosing to confront the regulatory challenges head-on rather than await further SEC actions. Previously, Uniswap Labs, the team behind the decentralized exchange Uniswap, also received a Wells Notice from the securities agency.

Greeks.live also highlighted the current state of the crypto market through its official account on X (formerly Twitter).


“Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole are still experiencing a deep pullback, with April becoming the deepest pullback month in almost a year, Dvol fell directly from 74% to 55% this week, volatility expectations in the markets are falling extremely fast […] Short term one can choose lower IV and price and start buying options properly and profitably now,” noted Greeks.live

In addition to Bitcoin options, almost 334,248 Ethereum contracts will expire today. These expiring contracts have a notional value of approximately $1 billion, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.36 and a maximum pain point of $3,000.
Despite the strong correction experienced in recent days, the global cryptocurrency market has experienced a 4% increase in the last 24 hours, bringing its total global capitalization to $2.32 trillion, according to CoinGecko data.

Recently, Bitcoin registered a sharp drop that took it below $57,000. However, it has rebounded and is in the range of $59,324. For its part, Ethereum has seen an increase of 1.5% to trade at $3,003.
Nonetheless, we must remember that the option expiration’s impact on the underlying asset’s price is short-term. Generally, the market will return to its normal state the next day and compensate for strong price deviations.

Why AI Won’t Rescue an Unplayable Web 3.0 Game - The Daily Hodl


								
 
AI in gaming is nothing new, but recent AI advancements provide numerous new ways to enhance games and their user experience – even if gamers themselves don’t particularly love it.
Whether leveraging AI to produce realistic enemy behavior and motion matching in ‘The Last of Us‘ or more accurately depicting real player skills and tactics with hyper-realistic animation in EA Sports’s ‘FC 2024,’ new AI use cases are subtly augmenting the majority of the gaming series we love.
It could go from what some veterans call a ‘necessary evil‘ to a feature that both players and developers value.
So, it’s no surprise that AI technology would also be applied to the world of Web 3.0 gaming – also commonly referred to as ‘blockchain’ or ‘NFT gaming.’
But can it be done in a way that doesn’t try to put digital duct tape over a messy game experience?
AI can play a (supporting) role in Web 3.0 gaming
When compared to the traditional gaming sector, Web 3.0 games are still infants, and like the broader crypto industry, have experienced their fair share of volatility.
The sector gained significant prominence during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, when many people were on unpaid leave, due to its introduction of play-to-win mechanics – with popular games like ‘Axie Infinity’ uniquely blending nostalgic gameplay with ownership of in-game NFT assets.
In attempts to replicate the success of ‘Axie’ and a few others, many new Web 3.0 gaming projects began launching.
However, it soon became clear most of these projects would fall short for one reason or another.
As the crypto industry imploded during the summer of 2022, Web 3.0 gaming and NFTs lost much of the little allure they had left, causing even the most popular games in the space to suffer by association.
This led to a steady decline in users, value and venture capital, forcing three out of every four games to shutter.
Without the cover and easy money of a bull market, the industry’s structural flaws and long-term sustainability became glaringly apparent.
Fair or unfair, critiques of first-generation Web 3.0 games were harsh – they are boring, lack compelling storylines, focus too much on the in-game economy and employ ‘pay-to-win’ mechanics.
Web 3.0 gaming’s main focus should be on correcting this narrative.
As Bitcoin settles at over $60,000 while the wider crypto industry continues its comeback almost two years after its crash, many gaming projects are turning to AI to garner interest and legitimacy from crypto enthusiasts, mainstream gamers and venture capitalists.
As with regular gaming, AI should be used where necessary to enhance the overall quality of Web 3.0 games.
For example, using AI to enhance interactions with NPCs (non-player characters) can make the game more rich, authentic and dynamic – something severely lacking in the first generation of Web 3.0 games.
Furthermore, AI can be creatively leveraged to regulate in-game economies, detect bots, generate NFTs and more.
These types of use cases can benefit the entire ecosystem by showing skeptics of Web 3.0 gaming that the new generation of developers and games have different priorities.
However, this doesn’t mean Web 3.0 game developers should use AI as a marketing ploy or gimmick to gain attention, as this resembles shallow tactics used during crypto’s 2021 bull run, which saw companies making exaggerated and misleading claims constantly.
These practices only backfired to generate much mockery and led to the sector being widely delegitimized.
As the industry embraces AI, gaming studios and developers must not fall into old habits by relying on AI’s hype to attract users.
Rewriting the script
As Web 3.0 gaming tries to mend its reputation, it’s paramount that the sector recognizes and fixes the mistakes and shortcomings that led to its widespread criticism.
Even for gaming studios and titles taking the appropriate steps to address the industry’s flaws, the focus must not be on using AI.
Just as early Web 3.0 games overly focused on token launches and crypto aspects such as staking and rewards, hyping up the use of AI or using it where it’s not beneficial will leave a bad taste in gamers’ mouths.
A more mature Web 3.0 gaming environment grants a second chance to the sector – but this time it can’t be squandered by employing superficial tactics in attempts to appeal to broader demographics.
You can’t use it to cut corners.
The only way to redefine the industry and take control of its narrative is through building better games that appeal to both mainstream gamers and crypto enthusiasts.
This means prioritizing storylines before token launches, quality graphics and audio over economic mechanisms, and an advanced physics engine instead of insignificant AI integrations.
At the same time, it is important to balance factors that will lead to higher quality games with the need to nurture the more promising aspects of Web 3.0 gaming – ownership and interoperability of in-game assets, transparent gameplay, community building and user participation in development.
Luckily, it appears that the industry is taking a different approach and addressing its flawed model.
As VCs show renewed interest in Web 3.0 gaming, it seems the new approach is paying off as more games have prioritized gameplay and gaming tokens’ market cap rose by nearly 25% in March.
All this is further boosted by better infrastructure in the form of more blockchain networks for developers to build on.
While the industry appears to be headed in the right direction, it needs to be cautious regarding how it uses AI – ultimately what is going to attract more gamers to Web 3.0 is the development of fun, high-quality games that smoothly and creatively integrate the best Web 3.0 features.
Without this, it doesn’t matter how much AI a game uses – because no one will play it.

Bitcoin Transaction Investigation By DOJ Addressed By Block CEO Jack Dorsey: 'We Take Compliance Seriously' - Block (NYSE:SQ) - Benzinga

Block Inc. SQ CEO Jack Dorsey addressed a potential Department of Justice investigation during the company’s first-quarter earnings call on Thursday.What Happened: Dorsey clarified that the company had proactively investigated potential threats in 2022, leading to a thorough review of transactions possibly linked to sanctioned countries. Dorsey stated, “In 2022, our compliance engineering risk team who proactively investigate threats identified signals that lead us to conduct a thorough review of transactions potentially associated with sanctioned countries.”According to Dorsey, these transactions were voluntarily reported to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the company received a no-action letter from OFAC, indicating no further investigation or action was required at the time.Regarding the prevention of tariff financing through Bitcoin BTC/USD, Dorsey highlighted the company’s robust control environment, including the use of leading blockchain analytics firms to screen transactions in real time and maintaining some of the most restrictive limits in the industry for on-chain Bitcoin withdrawals.“As it relates to preventing tariffs financing via Bitcoin, we have a robust control environment in place to mitigate exposure from adversaries. For instance, we use industry-leading blockchain analytics firms to screen transactions in real time. We also maintained some of the most restrictive limits in the industry for on chain Bitcoin withdrawals, which are deliberately calibrated to prevent bad activity,” Dorsey said. See Also: INSIDER BUYING: Vuzix VUZI Executives Including CEO Snap Up SharesHe also emphasized the company’s commitment to compliance, stating that it is foundational to their work and that they continuously improve their compliance program based on various inputs, including self-identified issues, audits, and guidance from regulators.“We take compliance seriously at Block. A culture of compliance is foundational to our work. We have a radically transparent culture that supports us. Employees are empowered to raise issues through multiple channels, including directly to me or anonymously through our Whistleblower hotline,” Dorsey said. Why It Matters: The earnings call comes amid a surge in Block Inc.’s stock price following the company’s strong first-quarter earnings report. Despite the positive financial results, the company has been under scrutiny due to allegations of processing crypto transactions for terrorists. These allegations have reportedly led to a DOJ investigation, prompting Dorsey to address the issue during the earnings call.Despite these challenges, Block Inc. has continued to make significant strides in the cryptocurrency space. Dorsey recently announced a new feature that allows Square merchants to convert a percentage of their daily sales into Bitcoin automatically. Additionally, the company has been working on making Bitcoin mining more accessible by developing a complete Bitcoin mining system.Price Action: Block Inc’s after-hours trading saw a notable increase, with the stock price rising to $75.78, marking a 7.80% surge from the previous close on Thursday, according to the data from Benzinga Pro.

Former FTX exec Ryan Salame to give up $5.9M Bahamas property

The former co-chief executive of FTX Digital Markets, Ryan Salame, has agreed to transfer his multimillion-dollar property in the Bahamas as part of his plea agreement in a criminal case.According to a motion from FTX Trading Ltd and affiliated debtors filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on May 1, Ryan Salame has agreed to give up a $5.9 million house he owns in the Bahamas. Salame pleaded guilty to criminal charges in September 2023 and his plea agreement required him to pay $5.6 million in restitution to the debtors.Instead of paying cash, Salame proposes to satisfy the restitution by transferring a residence he owns to FTX Digital Markets Ltd.“Salame will satisfy the Restitution Amount by transferring a residence he owns in the Bahamas, Unit No. 3A in the Marina Residences at Albany Building 10 Condominium, to FTX DM,” the filing read. Marina Residences at Albany. Source: Albanybahamas.comThe debtors argued that this is in their best interests as it avoids Salame having to sell the residence quickly at a discount, which could negatively impact their ability to monetize other Bahamian properties.In 2023, Bahamian realtors reported that high-end sales volumes had dropped by as much as 25%. Meanwhile, Australian real estate firm Properstar reported that apartment prices there have fallen 28% over the past 12 months. Salame was charged with conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions and defraud the Federal Election Commission, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Related: FTX co-CEO Salame's sentencing moved to end of MayThe filing also revealed that Salame agreed to purchase the property in September 2021 for $7.2 million and the 10% deposit was wired from an Alameda Research account at Silvergate Bank. In November of that year, FTX DM wired $8.1 million from its bank account at Fidelity Bank in the Bahamas to Salame’s real estate attorney to pay the balance of the purchase price. In March 2022, Salame and Alameda entered into a promissory note whereby he agreed to pay the $8.1 million to Alameda. However, FTX and Alameda imploded in early November 2022 with bankruptcy filings coming shortly after. Salame’s sentencing is currently scheduled for May 28, 2024.

Memecoins’ mass appeal makes it valuable to DEXs: Kain Warwick

Memecoin trading can be hugely valuable to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) as it can attract flows from a mass of non-traditional DeFi traders, says Synthetix founder Kain Warwick.“There’s an argument that memecoins are pure speculation, in my view speculation is good. It’s valuable,” Warwick told Cointelegraph at MemeGlobal Sydney.He added he wasn’t totally sold on memecoin critics’ arguments that the assets aren’t creating utility.Warwick — who is set to launch his “on-chain gateway” platform Infinex this month — explained that “out of memecoin trading, you get DEX volume and then DEXs have to respond and build better tools.”“Even if the investment is in a purely speculative instrument that has no utility, the ecosystem around it starts to form and that money flows through and the investment flows through into infrastructure, which I think is good.”Memecoin trading has surged in the last two months. The bulk of trading happens on DEXs as token creation tools like pump.fun makes them easy and cheap to launch — the majority are short-lived and don’t last long enough to get a centralized exchange listing.Monthly DEX volumes for March reached a nearly two-and-a-half-year high of $267.9 billion — just below the $292 billion November 2021 record at the peak of the last market cycle, according to DefiLlama. DEX volumes by month since 2021. Source: DefiLlamaApril figures saw $196 billion in DEX volumes — a 26.8% drop from March but still the seventh-strongest month overall.Speaking at the May 2 ETHGlobal Pragma Sydney event, Warwick said memecoins, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and GameFi “tap into more of a human emotion and cultural idea, which is much more interesting and accessible and addressable to the average person than DeFi.”“Financial engineering is not that interesting,” he added. “There’s just not that many people that find it deeply interesting.”Kain Warwick on stage at MemeGlobal Sydney. Source: Jesse Coghlan/CointelegraphWarwick said that while finance is “impactful to everyone” it’s not something people think about every day — “the average person doesn’t care.”Related: Fantom bets on ‘safer memecoins’ with launch of $6.5M dev fundGames, movies and music, however, were things Warwick believed the average person is “passionate about and really cares about.”“I think memes are maybe the most simplistic connection between financialization and tokenization of everything, and culture.”He added memecoins are “quite useful” as a “hook to get people interested” in DeFi and crypto.“There is something elegant in the simplicity of it,” Warwick said. “There’s no yield or revenue or cash flow or anything. It’s just: ‘Is this a dumb cool idea that I want to own, or is it not?’ That’s it.”Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?Additional reporting by Felix Ng.

'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Robert Kiyosaki Unveils His Bitcoin Strategy Amid Market Crash: 'The Best Time To Get Rich' - Vuzix (NASDAQ:VUZI) - Benzinga

Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the best-selling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” has shared his strategy for navigating the ongoing Bitcoin BTC/USD market crash, highlighting the potential for wealth growth during such periods.What Happened: Kiyosaki took to social media platform X, to share his insights on the current market situation. He began by acknowledging the commencement of a “bad” crash, but also pointed out that such downturns present unique opportunities for wealth accumulation.He warned against the devaluation of fiat currencies and encouraged his followers to view the crash as a potential turning point in their financial journey.“DON'T SAVE MONEY: Fake money (US dollar, Euro, Yen, Peso) goes down in value. Save gold, silver, Bitcoin, real money that goes up in value, especially in a market crash. TAKE CARE and make this CRASH the best thing that ever happened to you,” Kiyosaki said. The author outlined six rules to follow during a market crash. These included refraining from making impulsive investment decisions, seeking out reliable sources of information, surrounding oneself with like-minded individuals, starting a side business, choosing the right mentors, and investing in assets that retain or increase in value, such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin.See Also: INSIDER BUYING: Vuzix VUZI Executives Including CEO Snap Up SharesWhy It Matters: Kiyosaki’s advice comes at a time when the global economy is facing significant challenges. The U.S. is grappling with the specter of stagflation, a scenario characterized by slow growth and rising inflation. This has led to concerns about the future of the economy.The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates steady, emphasizing the need to allow more time for restrictive monetary policies to bring inflation towards the Fed's 2% goal. This decision has had a significant impact on market dynamics."The inflation data received so far this year have been higher than expected," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday, adding that it is likely that gaining greater confidence in disinflation will take longer than previously thought.However, there are also signs of resilience in the global economy, with the OECD revising its 2024 growth forecast upwards. This indicates a potential escape from the stagflationary trend, offering a glimmer of hope for the future.Earlier in the year, Kiyosaki had also expressed his bullish stance on Bitcoin, urging investors to buy as much as they could afford. His recent strategy aligns with this stance, emphasizing the potential of Bitcoin as a valuable asset during market downturns.Price Action: Bitcoin is presently trading at $59,7790, up 1.19% over the last 24 hours. Nonetheless, it has surged by 35.31% since the beginning of the year, according to the data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: If You Invested $1000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill a Decade Ago, This is How Much It’d Be Worth NowImage Via Shutterstock Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh BagalkoteThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

3 May: Six New Solana Memecoins That Could Skyrocket 9,000% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Bitcoin Price Plunges Following Lackluster Debut of Hong Kong ETF



                    

The launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Hong Kong on April 30 triggered a significant decline in Bitcoin’s price. 



Despite expectations of substantial demand, including projections of $140 million, the opening day’s total trading volume, incorporating Ether ETFs, amounted to only $12.4 million. 




Consequently, the premium on Bitcoin futures plummeted to its lowest point in five months, indicating a potential bearish trend.



Various factors have contributed to this negative pressure on Bitcoin’s price. 



Weak macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties surrounding U.S. spot BTC ETF flows have been prominent among them. 



Investors’ confidence in the United States Federal Reserve’s ability to implement two interest rate reductions in 2024 has waned, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to deliver post-meeting remarks on May 1, prompting cautious market behavior.



Continued net outflows from U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs over four consecutive sessions have raised further concerns. 



Investors have been withdrawing funds from the Grayscale GBTC ETF due to its high fees, while the Blackrock IBIT ETF has experienced minimal activity.

This trend suggests diminishing interest in such investments within the U.S. market despite the lackluster performance of the Hong Kong spot ETF.



Previously, cryptocurrency ETFs based on futures contracts listed on the Hong Kong exchange (HKEX) had attracted substantial net inflows totaling $529 million in the first quarter of 2024. 




Hence, the disappointing debut of the spot instrument on April 30 came as an unexpected setback. Analysts, including Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, speculate that poor timing may have contributed to the low trading volumes.



The broader financial landscape also played a role, with the S&P 500 poised to register its first negative monthly performance in six months in April, and yields on U.S. 5-year Treasury notes rising from 4.2% to 4.7%.

                        Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, said it has teamed up with the blockchain data platform Chainalysis to monitor secondary market activity and combat illicit activity.In an announcement, Tether which issues the cryptocurrency “USDT” pegged to the U.S. dollar, said it is launching new monitoring and analysis tools with Chainalysis. The tools will have the ability to identify wallets that may pose risks or may be associated with illicit or sanctioned addresses.“Tether’s proactive commitment to monitoring the secondary market for USDT – the world’s most popular cryptocurrency – has the potential to transform the entire ecosystem and make it a safer place to transact,” said Jonathan Levin, co-founder and chief strategy officer, of Chainalysis, in the blog post.Monitoring Secondary Market Activity
Tether goes on to explain that “secondary market activity” refers to transactions conducted within the broader ecosystem using USDT  beyond the limited entities that directly buy and sell USDT from Tether. The new tools have been formed by  Chainalysis and will allow Tether to “methodically monitor transactions” giving the firm oversight of the USDT market. The tools will be used by Tether compliance professionals and investigators by allowing them to identify wallets that may pose risks or may be associated with illicit or sanctioned addresses, said Tether.Tether Reports $4.52B Profit
Earlier this week, Tether reported a record net profit of $4.52 billion in the first quarter of 2024, marking a significant achievement for the company. The substantial profit was primarily attributed to the firm’s financial gains on Bitcoin and gold, totalling $3.52 billion, and an additional $1 billion from operating profits.In December, American credit ratings firm S&P Global Inc. said it had started assessing the ability of Tether to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar marking it at a ‘constrained’ rating of 4. The risk assessment is between 1 to 5 – with 5 being ranked weak. Tether has been scored weak due to the lack of information disclosed.Stablecoins are a cryptocurrency whose value is usually pegged to a fiat currency or commodity. Tether has been under scrutiny for years – the stablecoin was issued in 2014 and is the longest-standing stablecoin with the largest volume in circulation. Its price has remained relatively stable in recent years and particularly over the past 12 months, noted the S&P.

Bitcoin ETF Mania Drives Record Growth Across Coinbase's Platforms, CEO Brian Armstrong Notes 'We Saw All-Time Highs In Trading Volume...' - ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF Common Shares of Beneficial Interests (BATS:ARKB) - Benzinga

Coinbase Global Inc. COIN has experienced a significant surge in customer adoption and trading activity across its platforms, driven by the launch of several Bitcoin BTC/USD spot ETFs in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2024.What Happened: Coinbase’s co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong attributed the record growth to the excitement around Bitcoin ETFs. This led to all-time highs in trading volume and active clients, particularly in the institutional business.“The excitement around Bitcoin ETFs drove new customer adoption across our product suite,” said Armstrong. “We saw all-time highs in trading volume and active clients, for instance, in our institutional business.”The company’s institutional prime brokerage business, Coinbase Prime, also saw record levels of trading volume and active clients in the first quarter, driven by the Bitcoin ETF rollouts. This resulted in a significant increase in other transaction revenue, previously included in consumer transaction revenue, primarily due to higher Base sequencer fees and payment-related revenue, as indicated by Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas.See Also: 29-Year-Old Tesla Worker Who Got Fired Says He Slept In Parking Lot, Showered At Factory And Ate Microwaved Dinner: ‘Sacrificed A Lot For The Company’During the quarter, 40% of Coinbase’s institutional clients engaged with three or more Coinbase Prime products, such as custody, trading, staking, and financing. This, according to Coinbase’s President and COO Emilie Choi, directly impacted the company’s financials, leading to a 69% quarter-over-quarter growth in assets under custody to $171 billion and a 64% growth in custodial fee revenue to $32 million.The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 marked a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency industry. It reshaped market dynamics and contributed to Bitcoin’s surge to a new record high. The launch of ETFs like ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC, and VanEck Bitcoin Trust HODL saw substantial trading volumes. ARK 21Shares recorded a volume of 1,717,102 shares, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund saw a volume of 23,013,692 shares, and VanEck Bitcoin Trust had a volume of 106,685 shares. Why It Matters: The surge in Coinbase’s Q1 performance is in line with the company’s revenue beat and institutional trading volume hitting an all-time high. The company reported total revenue of $1.64 billion, surpassing a Street consensus estimate of $1.34 billion and a GAAP EPS of $4.40.Before the earnings report, Coinbase’s stock had surged over 300% in the past year, riding the crypto boom. The stock’s surge compared favorably to Bitcoin’s price, which rose by 103.13% over the past year. This performance indicates the company’s strong position in the market.Additionally, Coinbase’s decision to roll out support for the Lightning Network in collaboration with Lightspark, the largest U.S. crypto exchange by trading volume, has also contributed to the company’s growth. The Lightning Network offers a faster and cheaper way for users to send, receive, or pay with Bitcoin directly from their account, addressing scalability issues and enhancing the overall user experience.Price Action: On Thursday’s close, Coinbase Global Inc. traded at $223.70 in after-hours trading, marking a 2.25% decrease from the previous close, according to the data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Trump Says If Supreme Court Decides President Doesn’t Get Immunity Then Biden ‘Will Be Prosecuted For All His Crimes’Image Via Shutterstock This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

EigenLayer to cough up around 28M more EIGEN after airdrop backlash

Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer is airdropping around 28 million more of its native EIGEN tokens to over 280,000 wallets — just days after its first airdrop announcement. On Monday, EigenLayer announced it would allocate 15% of its total supply to the community, but some users deemed several provisions of its airdrop program as restrictive. In a May 2 post to X, the Eigen Foundation said that it will now be airdropping additional EIGEN tokens to the wallets of users who interacted with the protocol before April 29 — meaning it will also include the initial airdrop claimants.In a follow-up blog post, the restaking protocol shared that Season 1 claimants are set to receive a minimum of 110 EIGEN, while Season 2 claimants — those who interacted with the protocol between March 15 and April 29 — will receive a minimum of 100 EIGEN. Source: Eigen FoundationDespite the token not yet being released to the market, EIGEN perpetual futures contracts are currently trading for $10 on the derivatives market, per Aevo data, meaning the latest airdrop could be estimated to be worth around $280 million.This price of EIGEN could change significantly before the token’s official distribution event on May 10. EIGEN perps are changing hands for $10. Source: AevoUsers who felt left out of the first airdrop lashed out at the restaking protocol after it announced its “stakedrop” program on April 30. Critics focused the bulk of their criticisms on EIGEN’s nontransferable token structure, a smaller-than-expected 15% community allocation as well as “aggressive” geo-blocking and anti-VPN measures that saw users from 30 countries including the United States, Canada, China, and Russia blocked from claiming EIGEN tokens.EigenLayer shared that it would look to include more of its testnet users that may have been omitted from the airdrop.“Missed testnet user allocations will be updated as part of Phase 2 of Season 1. We will provide more details in the coming weeks,” wrote EigenLayer. Related: EigenLayer sees over 12,000 queued withdrawals — How far will TVL fall?In its first airdrop announcement, the Eigen Foundation said that while users could claim their tokens from May 10, they would be prevented from transferring or selling them until an undisclosed date.EigenLayer said this control was put in place to ensure that key features including payments and slashing parameters were “well established” before EIGEN became transferable among users.In the most recent blog post, EigenLayer provided further details concerning EIGEN’s non-transferability but still did not provide a date for when the tokens would be transferable for users. It said private investors and team members would be subject to a full one-year lock-up after the token became transferable to the community. “After that, they will unlock at 4% per month and finish fully unlocking three years after transferability. This ensures that the users of the protocol get transfer powers well before any core contributors can.”Magazine: The real risks to Ethena’s stablecoin model (are not the ones you think)

Bitcoin bottom in, now headed for a ‘slow grind higher’ - Arthur Hayes

Former BitMEX chief executive Arthur Hayes believes Bitcoin (BTC) has hit a local bottom and will slowly grind back up over the next few months. In a blog post on May 3, Hayes commented on the recent market slump claiming that “The price action played out as I expected.”Bitcoin hit a local low of around $58,600 earlier this week but will rally to above $60,000 and then remain rangebound between $60,000 and $70,000 until August, he said. Hayes added that the 12% Bitcoin retreat this week was a “well-needed market cleansing.”He blamed it on the tax season in the United States, worry over Federal Reserve decisions, the Bitcoin halving “sell the news event,” and a slowdown of spot Bitcoin ETF asset under management growth.The 23% correction was the fourth such retrace of similar magnitude over the past 12 months. Source: Arthur HayesHayes expects crypto markets to slowly grind higher after the recent sell-off, driven by increased dollar liquidity from the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening (QT) taper and the U.S. Treasury’s debt issuance plans.By tapering QT, the central bank is effectively injecting more liquidity into markets which could theoretically make its way into riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies, providing buying pressure.Hayes views this as “stealth money printing” which is positive for high-risk assets. “Are the recent Fed and Treasury policy announcements stealth forms of money printing? Yes.”“The slow addition of billions of dollars of liquidity each month will dampen negative price movement from here on out,” he added before predicting that prices will “bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher.”Related: 3 signs hint that Bitcoin price is nearing a bottomThe former BitMEX boss isn’t the only one predicting a sideways market for the next few months. Founder and CEO of Vailshire Capital Management, Dr. Jeff Ross, said he was “still respecting the ongoing bullcrab market,” despite the doom and gloom in a post to X on May 2. The Fed’s “rhetoric pivot” was the official transition from “bad-to-less-bad liquidity conditions,” he opined. Analysts and traders calling for the end of the Bitcoin bull market “may be dismayed to learn that the actual bull market hasn’t even started yet,” he said before concluding that the coming weeks will be an accumulation opportunity.In a note shared with Cointelegraph, institutional crypto brokerage MatrixPort reiterated its outlook that post-halving, “Bitcoin tends to move sideways afterward for four to five months based on previous instances.”Bitcoin prices had recovered 4.2% on the day to trade at $59,804 at the time of writing, however, the asset was still down 19% from the mid-March all-time high, according to CoinGecko.

Will SocialFi Fizzle? Dogecoin Founder Sounds The Alarm


								Social media, once a platform for cat videos and vacation photos, is undergoing a potential revolution with the rise of SocialFi. This burgeoning trend promises to merge the familiar world of social networking with the decentralized power of cryptocurrency.
But is SocialFi destined to be the next big thing, or just another flash in the pan? A recent exchange between Dogecoin creator Billy Markus and a SocialFi enthusiast has ignited a discourse about the movement’s true potential.

SocialFi: A Glittering Promise?
SocialFi platforms aim to empower users by putting them in control of their data and online interactions. Imagine a social network where you can not only connect with friends and follow influencers, but also earn rewards for creating content, curate your own digital space, and even participate in on-platform economies. This is the vision that has many tech enthusiasts buzzing.


The Shibe’s Skepticism
However, Billy Markus, better known online as Shibetoshi Nakamoto (a playful homage to Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin), has injected a dose of realism into the conversation.
In a recent social media post, Markus responded to a glowing endorsement of SocialFi with a blunt statement:

“I find it interesting when I get money from it and extremely uninteresting otherwise.”

Markus’ comment highlights a key concern surrounding SocialFi: the question of user engagement. Can these platforms offer more than just the allure of novelty? Will they provide tangible benefits that keep users coming back for more than just a quick financial buck?

DOGE market cap currently at $19.5 billion. Chart: TradingView.com
Big Names, Big Questions
While some industry leaders, like Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin, are vocal proponents of decentralized social networks, others share Markus’s cautious optimism. The success of SocialFi hinges not just on the technology itself, but on its ability to address the very issues that plague traditional social media – data privacy concerns, lack of content ownership, and the struggle for creators to earn a fair share of platform revenue.
The Valuation Rollercoaster
The current market capitalization of SocialFi sits at a relatively modest $1.33 billion. However, industry analysts predict a potential boom as major players like friend.tech prepare to launch their native tokens – digital assets used within the platform’s ecosystem.

The upcoming distribution of the FRIEND token, expected to be worth over a billion dollars, signifies a pivotal moment for SocialFi. Will it usher in a new era of user-driven social interaction, or will it simply inflate a bubble destined to burst?

Crypto Trader Warns Bitcoin Not ‘Out of the Woods Yet,’ Maps Path Forward for Solana and Ethena - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist is warning that Bitcoin (BTC) may not yet be done correcting.
Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 215,800 followers on the social media platform X that only after Bitcoin reclaims the $60,000 level will he have more confidence a bullish reversal is occurring.










“BTC: don’t think we’re out of the woods at all yet. We still need to reclaim some levels. [May 2nd’s] altcoin action is nice but I would not go all in at these current levels. Wait for BTC to show more strength first and break $60,000+ in my opinion.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
The analyst also says that Bitcoin’s sudden drop below $58,000 this week is similar to other corrections this cycle. He shares a chart of when Bitcoin declined from $47,000 to below $39,000 in January before continuing to the upside.
“BTC: for what it’s worth, this price action is super normal and there’s a lot of volatility while bottoms are formed. Not necessarily saying this is ‘the bottom’ but this is common to see. Expecting more chop/etc. over the next few days. Don’t get chopped to shit.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Bitcoin is trading for $59,389 at time of writing, up 2.5% in the last 24 hours.
Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL) may correct in the near term to as low as $116 based on his chart of Fibonacci retracement levels, but could rally within months.
“SOL: you just dollar-cast average in and don’t worry about it. wait there to 12 months and then sell it higher.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Solana is trading for $139.15 at time of writing, up more than 4% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, the analyst says says that the governance token of the decentralized finance protocol Ethena (ENA) appears likely extend its upward momentum after retesting the Fibonacci retracement level at $0.76.
“ENA: I’m out of this one but I think it looks solid. .618 Fibonacci + support/resistance level and market looking ok.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Ethena is trading for $0.80 at time of writing, up 1% in the last 24 hours.

Giant Claim from Analyst: "These Investors Holding $ 6 Trillion Are On Hold, Bitcoin Step May Come" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Retirees in the United States, who collectively hold nearly $6 trillion in public pension assets, are increasingly looking at Bitcoin ETFs as a potential investment opportunity, according to one analyst. Although the new spot Bitcoin ETFs have broken inflow records since their launch in January, they have yet to show their full potential, according to the analyst.
Darius Tabai, co-founder of decentralized exchange Vertex, believes the true power of these ETFs will emerge when millions of people with retirement accounts are exposed to these products. He predicts that once this happens, “coins will be bought continuously.”


Tabai, the former global head of metals trading at Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse, explained that ETFs tend to absorb assets. “Unless they are very poorly managed, they only go in one direction,” he said. However, after two months of aggressive inflows, most funds experienced days with no inflows and even net outflows in some cases.
According to Tabai, this is the nature of Wall Street. “People don't distribute their capital all at once,” he said. Financial advisors are unlikely to advise their clients to invest a large percentage of their money in BTC. Instead, if a portfolio is already performing well, advisors may encourage clients to allocate 1% to 5% of their funds into Bitcoin and scale over time.






“Once someone sets this and presses the button, this order will buy forever,” Tabai said. “When you get millions of people to do this, that's when you see the real impact. Naturally, this takes time.”
Tabai drew parallels with the launch of a gold ETF in 2004, which he said was vastly underestimated by investors at the time. Despite initial skepticism, gold has risen nearly 370% in almost seven years. Today, the largest gold ETF has over $61 billion in assets, and the price of the commodity is almost 500% higher than when the ETFs launched.


Tabai argued that Bitcoin is in a similar situation today.

Dogecoin vs Shiba Inu - This memecoin will lose big when selling wave hits - AMBCrypto



Both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have long-term holders with a decent profit
Speculators seemed more eager to short-sell one of them, compared to the other

Dogecoin [DOGE] and Shiba Inu [SHIB] recorded losses of 11.4% and 8.5%, respectively, over the past week. Both memecoins have gained just over 10% in the past 36 hours, meaning that the losses were much greater at the lowest point in the past week.
Bitcoin [BTC], at the time of writing, was trading under $60,000 too, while the sentiment across the market was fearful. Ergo, it seemed unclear how low this downtrend could go.
Hence, AMBCrypto analyzed the Futures market data to see if either DOGE or SHIB had formed a potential bottom before their bullish reversal.
Comparing the speculator sentiment behind Dogecoin and Shiba Inu

The Open Interest behind Shiba Inu has been on a steady downtrend since the first week of March. The price has also been in a retracement phase. Together, they highlighted a consistent lack of conviction from the bulls.
Some short-term bounces saw a large OI spike, but these were quickly reversed. It revealed that more and more market participants have been forced onto the sidelines. Meanwhile, Dogecoin was different.
It too saw a decline in OI, but most of it came in the second half of April. The price action showed that its bounce toward late March was larger, 86% for DOGE compared to 39% for SHIB. This explained the difference in Open Interest and hence, the sentiment.
It is fair to conclude that both mem coins are under a lot of pressure from sellers. Both projected bearish sentiment, but Shiba Inu has been weak for a longer period.
Which of the two is closer to forming a bottom?

Since SHIB has retraced for a longer period, could it be the token closer to forming the bottom? The funding rate behind Shiba Inu has been negative for many consecutive days in April. The stretches from 13 to 21 April, and from 27 April to 2 May.
On the contrary, DOGE saw a minor negative funding rate on Binance for a handful of days in the past two weeks. This suggested that market participants were more eager to short SHIB than DOGE, once again reinforcing the bearish sentiment.

Realistic or not, here’s DOGE’s market cap in BTC’s terms

Finally, the 365-day MVRV ratio of both memecoins were fairly healthy at 25.58% and 28.84% for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, respectively. This showed that despite the recent losses, holders were still up by a respectable amount.
It is likely that DOGE and SHIB will need Bitcoin to recover its bullish impetus before having a chance at recovery themselves. Until that happens, it is reasonable to conclude that SHIB is more likely to post heavier losses than DOGE in the event of a large wave of selling.

Pantera Capital Trusts Telegram Can Bring Crypto To the Public


							

American hedge fund Pantera Capital invests an undisclosed amount in The Open Network (TON).



Pantera Capital is confident about the network mainly because of its connection with Telegram.



TON Network’s Toncoin (TON) surges 12% following Pantera Capital’s groundbreaking move.




In an official blog dated May 2, American hedge fund Pantera Capital announced its first investment in The Open Network (TON). Though the amount is undisclosed, the platform has shared its enthusiasm for investing in TON, which is mainly driven by its extensive use within Telegram.



Pantera Capital posited that TON can introduce crypto to a large public. The hedge fund’s statement is based on TON’s connection with Telegram, which boasts over 900 million monthly active users. The firm added, “By leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and seamless UX with the vibrancy of TON’s emerging ecosystem, we believe TON has the potential to become one of the largest crypto networks.”



Further, Pantera Capital went on to highlight their belief in Telegram to introduce cryptocurrencies to large masses and establish the crypto space. They asserted that Telegram is the only social platform “free from regulatory hurdles to incorporate Web3 for an open blockchain network.”









Notably, TON is a blockchain initiative built by Telegram. It is designed as a decentralized network capable of supporting multiple applications. The TON ecosystem is vast and includes TON Blockchain, TON Storage, TON DNS, and TON Services. Among these elements, the backbone of TON Network is TON Blockchain.



Ryan Barney, Senior Investment Associate and Investor at Pantera Capital, shared an X post revealing the firm’s initial investment in TON. He wrote, “We believe TON, which can leverage a network of 900 million monthly active users, can truly introduce crypto to the masses.”







Following Pantera Capital’s groundbreaking move, the TON network’s native token, Toncoin (TON), has surged by 12% over the last 24 hours. Currently trading at $5.32, TON has experienced a monthly increase of more than 7% despite a marginal decline of 0.65% over the last week.

Will Markets Sink on $2.4B Crypto Options Expiry Event?


																There are around 23,000 bitcoin options about to expire on May 3. These have a notional value of around $1.4 billion which has been pretty similar to previous expiry events.
Crypto markets have been dumping hard all week but have recovered marginally in late trading on May 2. However, bitcoin remains under $60,000 and sentiment has turned bearish in the short-term.
Bitcoin Options Expiry
Today’s big batch of Bitcoin contracts have a put/call ratio of 0.49. This means that there are twice as many calls or long contracts expiring than puts or shorts.
The max pain point of these options is $61,000, which is a little higher than current spot prices. Max pain refers to the price at which most losses will be made upon contract expiry.
According to Deribit, there is still a lot of open interest at strike prices above $70,000. There is even $661 million in OI at the $100,000 strike price though the odds of BTC getting there in the short term are slim considering current market conditions.




Crypto derivatives solutions provider Greeks Live commented on this week’s launch of spot crypto ETFs in Hong Kong. Listings “failed to bring much incremental volume,” it said before adding that US spot Bitcoin ETFs continued to see outflows this week.
“The weakness of the market led to weakening market confidence,” it added before noting that implied volatility of all major terms continued to decline.
“The current IV level is the average watermark of the winter bull market, with some support, and the current buying is a good choice.”
Implied volatility is a measure of the future expected volatility derived from expiring crypto derivatives contracts.


In addition to today’s tranche of Bitcoin options, around 330,000 Ethereum options will also be expiring. These have a notional value of around $1 billion, bringing the total value of today’s crypto contract expiry event to $2.4 billion.
The ETH options have a put/call ratio of 0.36 and a max pain point of $3,000, a level recently reclaimed.
Crypto Markets Recover
There has been a slight recovery in crypto markets this Friday, with total capitalization gaining 4% to reach $2.35 trillion.
BTC gained a similar amount to trade at $59,600 at the time of writing, but it had yet to reclaim the psychological $60,000 level.
ETH had jumped above $3,000 following a 3.7% gain on the day. The altcoins were also recovering, with Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Toncoin (TON), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Polkadot (DOT) posting solid gains.
However, they have all lost heavily since this year’s market high in mid-March.

Coinbase Nets $1.18B in Q1 2024: Financial Report


							

Coinbase reported a total revenue of $1.64 billion with a net income of $1.18 billion.



The company also reported consumer transaction revenue of $935 million.



Subscription and service revenue contributed $511 million for Q1, 2024.




Coinbase, the largest digital asset trading platform in the United States by trading volume, reported net income of $1.18 billion, or $4.40 per share, compared to a year-ago loss of $78.9 million, or 34 cents a share. 



On the other hand, the company reported its first profit in two years in February, when the price of Bitcoin (BTC) started to climb. The notable increase in net income was partly attributed to a $650 million mark-to-market gain on crypto assets held for investment, following the adoption of updated accounting standards by the company.



In terms of revenue, Coinbase saw a substantial surge in consumer transaction revenue, reaching $935 million for the quarter, more than doubling from the same period last year, according to CNBC. Total transaction revenue nearly tripled to $1.08 billion, with subscription and services revenue contributing $511 million for the quarter.



Investors reacted positively to the news, with Coinbase shares climbing almost 9% on Thursday ahead of the report. Year-to-date, the stock has risen approximately 32%, building on a nearly fivefold increase in 2023. 









During the first quarter, the crypto market witnessed significant milestones, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $73,000 in March, and Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset, undergoing its first major upgrade in over a year. 



The approval of new US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also attracted institutional investors, with many funds partnering with Coinbase as their custody partner. These funds collectively brought in more than $50 billion by the end of the first quarter.

Bitcoin selling pressure to ease? M2 money supply flips positive

The recent Bitcoin sell-off could soon slow down as the year-over-year M2 money supply has turned positive for the first time since November 2022 — a signal investors use to start looking for hedges against inflation.Crypto analysis firm Glassnode highlighted an uptick in Bitcoin (BTC) “net outflows across all cohorts throughout April, suggesting a consistent sell-side pressure across the board,” in a May 2 post on X.Bitcoin’s price dropped 9.75% over the past 30 days and traded at $59,586 at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data.Source: GlassnodeHowever, the M2 money supply — an estimate of all cash held and short-term bank deposits across the United States — flipped positive on May 1 year-over-year, meaning an overall increase of money in circulation. Increasing money supply is usually an indicator for investors to turn their focus to assets that outperform in high inflationary periods.Historically, the Bitcoin and crypto markets have started outperforming the traditional financial markets with a rise in global M2 supply.The positive shift in M2 money supply has prompted crypto traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s price, as the supply had been in negative territory since November 2022.Source: Thomas Fahrer“For the first time, M2 Money Supply is “year-over-year” positive,” professional trader and financial author Oliver L. Velez explained in a May 2 post on X while providing a very bullish outlook to his 49,800 followers:“All I can say is, “buckle-up” and stack harder. Any and all dips are buyable.

Paragraph is set to assume stewardship of Mirror, including its product, design system, and brand.Paragraph Takes Over Mirror
Founded in late 2020, Mirror introduced a publishing platform that provided writers with crypto tools including decentralized storage, domains, crowdfunding, and NFT capabilities. The platform was frequently used by companies to publish announcements and blogs.“When I founded Mirror in 2020, I bet on the potential for platforms that merge content with marketplaces of value,” said Mirror founder Denis Nazarov. “I’m excited to see Mirror taken to the next level of onchain publishing under Colin’s leadership.”Paragraph was launched in 2021, designed to enable creators to monetize directly through newsletter subscriptions and on-chain social features, as well as messaging integrations.

Divergent Paths of FTX Execs: A Titanic Watch and Legal Battles


Following FTX’s collapse, the trajectories of its former executives have diverged sharply. Patrick Gruhn, the German fintech entrepreneur who led FTX Europe, recently made headlines with a historic purchase. Meanwhile, Ryan Salame, former co-chief executive of FTX Digital Markets, faced a bleaker resolution, giving up his multimillion-dollar property in the Bahamas.
In a separate development, FTX estate continues to sell its token holdings as a part of its reimbursement plans.
From FTX to Titanic Relics
According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Gruhn purchased a 14-karat gold pocket watch that survived the Titanic’s sinking. The watch was once owned by John Jacob Astor IV for nearly $1.5 million. Henry Aldridge & Son, an English auction house renowned for its Titanic memorabilia, confirmed the sale.
This purchase is beyond a significant acquisition. Gruhn admitted that this watch is a gift for his wife, and he plans to exhibit it in museums.


“This is more than an artifact; it’s a reminder of resilience and history,” Gruhn commented.

Despite his connections with Sam Bankman-Fried, the controversial co-founder and former CEO of FTX, Gruhn was able to negotiate his way out of a potential legal mess. The settlement freed him from a lawsuit. The lawsuit could have forced him to return over $323 million, which Bankman-Fried allegedly overpaid for the Swiss firm that later became FTX Europe.
Gruhn stated that he had learned of Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent activities when FTX collapsed. He also mentioned that he used money earned from selling his companies to purchase the watch.
Since departing from FTX, he has launched a new business to develop a European crypto derivatives exchange. Additionally, he runs a German Catholic TV network.
Salame’s Settlements and SOL Token Sales

In contrast, Ryan Salame, former co-chief executive of FTX Digital Markets, faced a harsher outcome. He became involved in legal proceedings and ultimately agreed to surrender his $5.9 million property in the Bahamas.
According to the information in a motion from FTX Trading Ltd. and its affiliated debtors and debtors-in-possession, this action was part of his obligation to make restitution for his guilty plea to charges of fraud and conspiracy.
BeInCrypto reported Salame pleaded guilty at the court on September 7, 2023. However, authorities released him on a $1 million bond with the support of two co-signers. His sentencing is set for May 28, 2024.
Meanwhile, the crypto community closely watches the FTX estate’s maneuvers, such as selling Solana tokens.

The FTX estate has begun its second tranche of token sales, fetching between $85 to $110 each. Despite the discount to current market prices, demand remains high. Active participation from notable firms like Galaxy Trading and Pantera Capital in these auctions represents the interest in these sales.

The objective of the estate is to initiate repayments by late 2024. This strategy was developed during a recent meeting of FTX Digital’s Joint Official Liquidators in the Bahamas. They are handling a dual bankruptcy procedure in the United States and the Bahamas.

Caution in the Air: JPMorgan Sees Trouble in Crypto Markets


JPMorgan analysts continue to advocate for caution in the crypto markets, citing several concerns that cloud the market’s immediate future. 
This cautious perspective from JPMorgan serves as a critical guide for investors navigating the volatile crypto markets.
JPMorgan Analysts Talk About Factors Affecting Crypto Markets
Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, leading the analytical team, highlights the triple threat of high Bitcoin pricing, dwindling retail interest, and the chill in venture capital funding as primary reasons for their conservative outlook.

“With a lack of positive catalysts, and the retail impulse dissipating, we maintain a cautious stance on crypto markets over the near term,” JPMorgan analysts wrote.


Despite previous optimism in August 2023 that the sell-offs were tapering off, recent developments have seen a sharp reversal. In April, Bitcoin experienced a steep decline of 16%, marking its largest monthly drop since June 2022. Consequently, this drop coincides with a broader disinterest among retail investors, who have pulled back from crypto and equity markets.

This waning enthusiasm is evident in the outflows recorded in US-based spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 
Specifically, on May 1, these 11 ETFs saw a combined net outflow of $563.7 million. This was the highest ETF withdrawal rate to date. 

The lack of new investments in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) further supports this trend. IBIT has not seen any inflows in the last seven trading days.
Similarly, equity funds also reported net outflows, reversing the inflow trend observed in earlier months of February and March.
The shift in investor sentiment can be partly attributed to profit-taking activities, especially by institutional players. According to JPMorgan, commodity trading advisors and quantitative funds have scaled back their previously bullish positions in both Bitcoin and gold. This profit-taking indicates a cautious recalibration of risk among these seasoned investors.
In stark contrast to the current cautious stance, JPMorgan had previously noted an uptick in Bitcoin futures trading activity back in August 2023. Analysts interpreted this as a sign of market stabilization and discussed the potential for a rebound. Indeed, Bitcoin did rally to a new all-time high in March 2024.

However, the recent pullback has prompted a reassessment of the market’s trajectory.

                        Jack Dorsey-led Block announced plans to allocate 10% of profits from its Bitcoin products toward buying more of the cryptocurrency each month, its quarterly report published Thursday showed.Block was one of the first public companies to add Bitcoin to its holdings in 2020. With an initial investment of $220m, its Bitcoin holdings have surged 160% to hit $573m by the end of Q1 in 2024.“We believe the world needs an open protocol for money, one that’s not owned or controlled by any single entity,” CEO Dorsey company said in a letter to shareholders. He added that “bitcoin is the best and only candidate to be that protocol, and to ultimately become the native currency of the internet.”Block currently allocates less than 3% of its resources to Bitcoin projects, Dorsey said.In the first quarter, the payments firm’s gross profit grew 22% year-over-year to $2.09b. Net income quadrupled to $472m, or 74 cents per share, compared to $98.3m or 16 cents per share in the same quarter last year.Meanwhile, Block raised its adjusted EBITDA forecast for the second quarter to $690m from $670m. The company also raised its annual adjusted core earnings guidance to at least $2.76b. This is up from its previous forecast of $2.63b.These strong results and optimistic outlook sent the stock price 5% higher to close at $70.30 on Thursday.Cash App Fuels Block’s Growth, Faces Potential Regulatory Heat
Block’s mobile payment platform, Cash App, continued to be a profit powerhouse. The unit generated $1.26b in gross profit, a 25% increase year-over-year.However, the company faces a potential regulatory hurdle. Currently, federal prosecutors are investigating alleged compliance issues at Square and Cash App.These concerns reportedly center on Block potentially failing to collect adequate customer information. The investigation is also looking at transactions from sanctioned countries and enabling crypto transactions for terrorist groups.A former employee has claimed that thousands of transactions went unreported, suggesting a significant challenge for Block in the coming months.Block Unveils Advanced Bitcoin Mining System
Block recently ramped up its Bitcoin mining efforts. It is transitioning from designing individual chips to developing a complete mining system.The company finalized the design of a cutting-edge 3 nanometer Bitcoin mining chip and is now partnering with a major semiconductor foundry to bring it to life.

Arthur Hayes Says Bitcoin Bottom Is In, Predicts Slow but Steady Climb Back Up



Hayes claims that the rise in BTC price will be driven by increased dollar liquidity from the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening taper and the US Treasury’s debt issuance plans.

Co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX crypto exchange Arthur Hayes has shared his thoughts on the price action of Bitcoin (BTC). Hayes, who is an industry expert, revealed in a Friday blog post that the crypto may just have bottomed in and is expected to slowly climb back up over the next few days.
According to Hayes, the recent market slump was nothing short of expectation. That is as conditions, including the US tax season, uncertainty over Fed actions, the “sell the news event” of Bitcoin halving, and other things contributed to the price action that brought over 23% correction to the market. To Hayes, however, all that happened was merely a “well-needed market cleansing”.




Steady Rise Up Next for Bitcoin, Says Arthur Hayes
The former BitMEX chief believes that a resurgence is now in order for the crypto markets after the just-concluded selloffs. He claims that the rise will be driven by increased dollar liquidity from the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening (QT) taper and the US Treasury’s debt issuance plans.
Hayes says that the QT program by the Fed effectively injects more liquidity into markets, which could theoretically increase the amount of stimulus provided to the global assets markets. Consequently, this liquidity is also expected to make its way into riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, hence creating a buying pressure. An excerpt from the post reads:
“By reducing the rate of QT from $95 billion to $60 billion per month, the Fed is essentially adding $35 billion per month of dollar liquidity.”
For all the different amounts that the Fed intends to taper QT with on a monthly basis, expectations are that the move will, in turn, add billions of dollars of liquidity. Hayes says that means that from here on out, the liquidity will ultimately cancel out the negative price movement as crypto prices first flatten out before grinding higher, albeit slowly.
Similar Views
Meanwhile, it might be worth noting that Hayes is not alone with his views on BTC price movement. Founder and CEO of Vailshire Capital Management, Dr. Jeff Ross believes that analysts would be surprised to find out that, contrary to popular belief that the Bitcoin bull market has ended, the actual bull run may not have even started yet. He shared the opinion via a May 2 X post, further buttressing Hayes’ claims.
Interestingly, Bitcoin prices had posted a slight recovery on the day. As of publication, Coinspeaker data shows Bitcoin gaining 2.9% in the last 24 hours to be trading at $59,279. However, the asset is still down 10% from the last month.

Bitcoin price is failing to break these 2 key resistance lines at $60K

Bitcoin (BTC) faces major resistance, which is keeping the BTC price rebound below $60,000.While recovering up to 6.2% from this week’s lows, BTC/USD has not managed to break through key trendlines, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirms.Moving average threatens BTC price "ordeal”Bitcoin saw a 23% pullback from all-time highs through April and into May, and so far, the odds of a return to BTC price discovery remain low.As Cointelegraph reported, Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, expects rangebound trading below $70,000 to characterize BTC/USD through August.First, however, $60,000 must be reclaimed, and so far, the trendlines guarding it are winning out over bulls.On the radar is Bitcoin’s 100-day moving average (MA), currently at $59,930 as of May 3.This trendline has acted as market support since October 2023 and provided a floor through the first half of 2023’s Bitcoin bull market.Now, however, the price is printing full daily candles below it.BTC/USD 1-day chart with 100 SMA.

Bitcoin (BTC) Regains $60,000 as US Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged | Coinspeaker



The Federal Reserve’s decision had immediate repercussions in the financial markets, including the crypto sector.

After a downward trend since April 30, with prices falling below $58,000,  Bitcoin (BTC) has made a notable recovery.  As of Friday morning, the crypto asset briefly reclaimed the $60,000 levels, signaling a potential trajectory towards the crucial $65,000 threshold analysts believe is pivotal for a potential rally. This rebound in Bitcoin’s value is largely attributed to the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain interest rates unchanged, citing insufficient progress toward lowering inflation.
Unchanged Interest Rates
The  Federal Reserve made it clear on Wednesday that high inflation has been a persistent issue in recent months, stating that it will hold off on cutting interest rates until it is more confident that price increases are sustainably slowing towards its 2% target.




This decision has kept the bank’s key rate at its highest level in over two decades, ranging from 5.25% to 5.5% since last July. By maintaining high borrowing costs, the Fed aims to temper economic growth and alleviate the pressures contributing to rising prices.
The Fed’s decision was announced after its latest meeting, during which it chose to keep its key rate at approximately 5.3%.
Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, emphasized that, regardless of this year’s upcoming US presidential election, the central bank will continue to base its interest rate decisions on independent analysis.
Powell cautioned against introducing additional considerations into the decision-making process, stating that doing so could lead to unintended negative outcomes.
Market Response to Fed’s Unchanged Rates
The Federal Reserve’s decision had immediate repercussions in the financial markets, including the crypto sector. Market indicators show a slight recovery from recent lows, with the industry now valued at approximately $2.22 trillion, marking a 3.34% increase within the past 24 hours.
The positive market sentiment has buoyed Bitcoin, witnessing a rise of over 4% in value.
However, despite this uptick, the crypto asset remains more than 10% below its recent peak of $66,000 in April and has experienced a significant decline of over 22% from its all-time high of $73,000 in March.
The resurgence is not limited to Bitcoin alone, as other altcoins have also seen positive movements. Ethereum (ETH) has surged by 3.35%, crossing the $3,000 mark for the first time since Tuesday.
Similarly, Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced gains ranging from 3.4% to 9.34% over the past day, indicating a broader market recovery across various digital assets.

Why Coinbase Had an Amazing Q1 2024 Despite Launch of US Spot Bitcoin ETFs | Cryptoglobe


                                
On May 2, Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN) released its Q1 2024 financial results. Here is what it said in its Shareholder Letter:“Our financial performance in Q1 reflects our focused execution on product expansion, ongoing operational discipline, and strong crypto market conditions. We generated $1.6 billion of total revenue and $1.2 billion of net income*. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.0 billion – more than we generated in all of 2023. Additionally, we made meaningful progress against our 2024 priorities of driving revenue, utility, and regulatory clarity. 



Our market share in US spot and derivatives increased, we reached all-time highs on Coinbase Prime, and USDC market capitalization increased. Coinbase One adoption remains strong, and our international business was a larger contributor to our growth. Through Base, our Layer 2 solution, we are expanding the utility of crypto by improving the infrastructure of the ecosystem, increasing speed and stability of the network, and empowering builders to innovate onchain. 



Lastly, we continue to drive regulatory clarity for crypto through grassroots advocacy, pushing for legislation, and ongoing efforts to seek clarity through the courts. All in, Q1 was a highly productive start to 2024 for Coinbase and we remain as focused as ever on our mission of increasing economic freedom in the world.“



On the same day, shortly before the company’s earnings call, Alesia Haas, the Coinbase CFO, appeared on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” to discuss the company’s first-quarter results, the impact of Bitcoin’s strength and the strategic investments made by the platform. 



Haas highlighted that Q1 2024 was a robust period for Coinbase, reflecting substantial growth facilitated by favorable market conditions and the fruition of product investments made over the past two years. The company saw market share gains in both spot and derivatives trading. Moreover, Coinbase’s Prime platform, designed for institutional clients, reached all-time highs during this quarter.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

One of the key strategic initiatives mentioned by Haas was the acceleration in the adoption and scalability of “Base,” Coinbase’s Layer 2 blockchain. This technology is aimed at ushering users into the next generation of crypto applications, indicating a shift towards more scalable blockchain solutions that could cater to a broader audience.



Discussing the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., Haas explained that these financial products have significantly benefited Coinbase by enhancing engagement across its Prime platform. These crypto ETFs have made it easier for traditional investors to access cryptocurrencies through familiar brokerage accounts, bypassing the need for direct interaction with crypto exchanges like Coinbase. Despite potential concerns about diverting users away from Coinbase’s platform, Haas confirmed that the introduction of these spot ETFs resulted in net inflows across the board—including an increase in consumer and institutional trading on Coinbase.



Haas pointed out a striking increase in institutional transaction revenue, which surged by 133% from the previous quarter, outpacing the growth in consumer transaction revenue. She believes this trend underscores the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, a continuation of the bull market of 2021. While consumer trends can be more volatile and influenced by short-term market fluctuations, Haas expects institutional engagement to grow steadily, reflecting a long-term positive outlook for the adoption of crypto assets by larger financial entities.



When asked about the influence of geopolitical turmoil and economic factors like bond yield fluctuations on customer activity, Haas noted that Coinbase users are predominantly focused on cryptocurrency-specific trends rather than broader macroeconomic or geopolitical developments. This observation suggests that while market makers and institutional clients may react to external economic indicators, retail investors in the crypto space are likely more concerned with developments within the crypto market itself.

Tether strengthens blockchain and stablecoin compliance with Chainalysis

The world’s largest stablecoin issuer, Tether, has recently enhanced compliance measures through the blockchain monitoring solution by Chainalysis.
In particular, the purpose of the collaboration is to create a custom solution to monitor secondary market activities. Let’s see all the details below.

Stablecoin news: Tether partners with blockchain data platform Chainalysis
As anticipated, Tether, the leading company in the digital asset sector, has partnered with Chainalysis, a renowned blockchain data platform, to develop a customized solution.
The purpose of the latter is to allow monitoring of secondary market activities.
The secondary market includes transactions involving USDT (Tether’s stablecoin) within a broader ecosystem, beyond direct agreements between Tether and its counterparts. 
The solution developed by Chainalysis allows Tether to systematically monitor these transactions, offering a clearer view of the USDT market.
This tool allows Tether compliance professionals to identify wallets that may pose risks or be linked to addresses involved in illegal or sanctioned activities.
The solution integrates various monitoring and analysis tools. These include sanctions monitoring, which lists in detail the addresses and transactions related to sanctioned entities. 
Furthermore, they include a categorization function that divides USDT holders by type, such as exchanges and darknet markets.
Finally, it provides a detailed analysis of the main USDT portfolios, allowing for a thorough examination of the movements of heavyweight investors. 
It also provides a illicit transaction detector, essential for identifying activities potentially linked to crimes such as terrorism financing.
Some statements regarding the new collaboration 
Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, commented as follows: 
“Collaborating with Chainalysis represents an important step towards greater transparency and security in the world of cryptocurrencies. Tether is committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity and this collaboration confirms our proactive approach in protecting our ecosystem from illicit activities.”
On the other hand, Jonathan Levin, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Chainalysis, said: 
“Tether’s proactivity in monitoring the secondary market of USDT, the most widely used stablecoin in the world, has the potential to transform the entire ecosystem and make it safer. The transparency of cryptocurrencies provides the opportunity to work with law enforcement to block illegal funds and discourage the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities such as terrorism and scams.”
Tether is committed to actively combating illicit activities in the cryptocurrency industry. The company collaborates with 124 law enforcement agencies in 43 global jurisdictions, promoting communication and information exchange to combat illegal activities.
The strict enforcement of compliance rules and prompt action against the improper use of USDT demonstrate Tether’s commitment to maintaining high standards and contributing to creating a safer environment for all participants.
Tether marks a record quarter with profits of $1 billion
Tether has recently recorded a record profit in the first quarter of 2024. According to a recent attestation report, the company reported a net profit of 1 billion dollars, with a total group net worth of 11.37 billion dollars. 
These results represent a significant leap forward compared to the 7.01 billion dollars recorded at the end of 2023. Furthermore, Tether reported the highest percentage ever of holdings in Treasury bonds.
These data highlight the strong growth of Tether Holdings Limited at the beginning of 2024. The company attributes its success to stablecoin issuers and reserve managers, who contributed 1 billion dollars to the overall result. 
Most of Tether’s profit comes from operations with US Treasury securities, while a smaller portion comes from positions in Bitcoin and Gold.
Regarding investments in Treasury bonds, Tether has increased its direct and indirect positions to over 90 billion dollars in the first quarter of 2024. 
The company has also included in the calculations the indirect exposures through reverse overnight repurchase agreements secured by Treasury securities and investments in money market funds.
This is the first time that Tether reveals its net worth, a gesture that underlines the company’s growing commitment to transparency. 
Furthermore, Tether has announced to keep 1 billion dollars as excess reserve, a buffer to support the stablecoin supply, bringing the total reserves to about 6.3 billion dollars.

Further, Kong asserted that Fantom prioritizes customer demands; Fantom aims to satisfy its customers by fulfilling their needs. In its latest move, Fantom intends to provide a safe memecoin space with a democratic distribution of tokens to the community.









Meanwhile, FTM has slightly emerged from the bearish track, with a marginal increase of 2% over the last 24 hours. However, the token, currently priced at $0.6773, has been exhibiting severe downturns over the last month. FTM experienced notable 10% and 22% declines in the last week and month, respectively.

Jack Dorsey's Block (SQ) Q1 2024 Shareholder Letter; Doubles Down on Bitcoin | Cryptopolitan

Jack Dorsey has certainly been an avid believer in Bitcoin and blockchain technology. His recent letter to Block Inc. shareholders keeps living up to his firm belief in a future where Bitcoin’s use cases are well refined. In his statement, Jack says he strongly believes the internet will have a native currency, and it’s just a matter of time before it’s achieved. In his Shareholder letter, Jack Dorsey expresses his ambitions for Bitcoin and Block. According to him, making Bitcoin more usable every day means seeing Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, realizing Satoshi Nakamoto’s original dream for the cryptocurrency. Jack Dorsey’s Block Inc. has always been heavily involved with Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. In the Q1 Shareholder’s letter, Dorsey defends Block’s interests in Bitcoin, saying that the company spends a lot of time on Bitcoin because it believes the world needs an open protocol for money, one that isn’t owned or controlled by any single entity. Block has since been deeply involved in developing the open protocol to help serve more people around the world. Dorsey dubbed down on Bitcoin, saying unlike other cryptocurrencies, Block is focused on Bitcoin because of its capabilities and intended use case. Other cryptocurrencies in the market seek to solve different problems that are not aligned with Block Inc.’s mission. Jack Dorsey’s Block Inc. Plans for BitcoinIn 2018, Block became the first publicly listed company to offer a Bitcoin product. Since then, the company has focused on making Bitcoin accessible, more secure, and usable on a daily basis. Jack Dorsey said these three core directives have been the company’s main focus since. Guided by the three core directives, Block Inc. built a simple app called Cash App that allows users to buy, sell, and withdraw Bitcoin. As a result of a successful launch, the app has generated 3.3% and 4.2% of Block’s gross profits in 2022 and 2023, with only 0.7% of related expenses. Jack closed his Shareholders’ letter with a huge announcement for the Bitcoin community, saying that, going forward, Block will be investing 10% of its gross profits from Bitcoin products into Bitcoin purchases each month. The Dollar-Cost Averaging approach will minimize the impact of volatility on Block’s Bitcoin assets.The company, in general, has had a good run with Bitcoin, being one of the first to incorporate BTC into its balance sheets. Jack Dorsey revealed Block’s Bitcoin holdings have more than doubled (160%) from $220 million initially invested to the current net value of $573 million.

Bitpanda: the crypto exchange has become a leader in Europe

Bitpanda closes its first quarter of 2024 with its position as the leading crypto-exchange in Europe, thanks to its offering of a whopping 411 cryptocurrencies. 
Not only that, through its B2B platform, Bitpanda Technology Solutions (BTS), these cryptos are also available to partner banks, fintech companies, (neo-)brokers, and cryptocurrency companies. 

Bitpanda: the leading exchange in Europe now offers a total of 411 cryptocurrencies, also available on BTS
Good news at home Bitpanda: the broker confirms to be a leader in Europe for its wide range of cryptocurrencies and more. 
And indeed, Bitpanda now boasts over 4.5 million European users in almost 30 countries, after a significant period of growth. Its leadership can also rely on its wide range of 411 cryptocurrencies, as well as 2,800 digital assets including stocks, ETFs, precious metals, and commodities. 
These cryptocurrencies (and all assets) have also been made available on the B2B platform, Bitpanda Technology Solutions (BTS), involving partner banks, fintech companies, (neo-)brokers, and cryptocurrency companies. 
Specifically, BTS provides the infrastructure to unlock trading for over 19.5 million customers across Europe.
In this way, traditional banks, fintech companies, (neo-) brokers, and cryptocurrency companies will be able to offer trading, investment, and custody services for every asset class in a modular way, integrating a modular and scalable trading infrastructure 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Not only that, BTS is an ISO 27001 certified platform and involves other features such as savings plans, asset-to-asset swaps, and crypto staking functionalities.
Bitpanda: the crypto-exchange and its B2B platform, BTS, conquering Europe
Bitpanda is expanding also thanks to the results of its new B2B platform, Bitpanda Technology Solutions (or BTS). 
In this regard, Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, CEO of BTS, said:
“When we launched BTS, we knew it would cause a significant disruption in the European banking space. Competition has never been so fierce for banking customers, as more and more people in Europe are taking an interest in their finances, even exploring crypto assets. With BTS, our partners get an authorized, modular, secure, and scalable trading infrastructure they can rely on in just a few months. Tokenization is here to stay, access to it is now the benchmark by which banks are measured, and this is what BTS enables them to do.”
Not only that, such growth and expansion of Bitpanda aims to conquer Europe, also from a regulatory perspective. 
Philipp Bohrn, CEO and Head of Regulation at Bitpanda, commented: 
“This extension of the license is another important piece of the puzzle. The corresponding law was only introduced in February 2023 and we received the relevant license less than a year after applying for it. Bitpanda is the first provider of virtual currencies to have all the necessary licenses to offer not only virtual currencies to its customers, but also financial instruments throughout the European Union. For us at Bitpanda, regulatory compliance is not only a fundamental part of our strategy, but also a key differentiating factor from other market operators. Bitpanda actively seeks exchange with regulatory authorities and will continue to do so within the framework of MiCAR.”
Q1 2024: important partnerships and 
Only in this first quarter (or Q1) of 2024, the Austrian exchange Bipanda seems to have acted strategically, aiming precisely to achieve the desired growth results. 
And indeed, right in January 2024, Bitpanda consolidated its long-term partnership with the renowned German football club Bayern Munich, becoming the exclusive crypto partner. 
Already with this collaboration, Bitpanda has secured a wide television visibility, being well represented inside and around the Allianz Arena. Furthermore, there is the opportunity to collaborate with the players as part of a broader branding commitment. 
When it comes to financial institutions, Bipanda has then entered into a new partnership with Raiffeisenlandesbank Niederösterreich-Wien (RLB NÖ-Wien) bank, to offer crypto trading together. 
Thanks to the new partnership, customers of the traditional bank RLB NÖ-Wien can access well over 2000 digital assets (such as crypto, precious metals, etc) through the mobile banking app “Mein ELBA”.
More recently, however, Bitpanda welcomed a new partner into its home: the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW), the largest federal bank in Germany. In this case, Bitpanda is involved in launching crypto custody services, through its “investment-as-a-service” infrastructure.

The Cryptonomist

Important crypto news for Jito, which has become the largest protocol on the Solana blockchain, with 10 million SOL, equivalent to 1.4 billion dollars in total locked value.
Let’s see below all the details. 

Jito reaches a prominent position on the Solana crypto blockchain
As anticipated, the liquid staking and MEV infrastructure project Jito has become the largest protocol on the Solana blockchain, with a total value locked (TVL) of 1.4 billion dollars.
With an equivalent of about 10 million SOL, Jito represents approximately 38% of the $3.7 billion TVL of the Solana ecosystem, according to DeFiLlama data.
The Marinade staking protocol is in second place with 1.37 billion dollars of TVL, followed by Kamino, Raydium, and Marginfi with 1 billion dollars, 613 million dollars, and 424 million dollars respectively.
In the liquid staking sector in general, Jito is among the top five on all blockchains, with 3% of the total TVL of 45.5 billion dollars. 
Lido dominates this category with 27.6 billion dollars, followed by Rocket Pool, Binance, and Mantle with 3.6 billion dollars, 2.6 billion dollars, and 1.4 billion dollars respectively.
Approximately 40% of Jito’s flagship liquid staking token supply, JitoSOL, is used as collateral in DeFi.
Lucas Bruder, collaborator of Jito Network, stated the following:
“This is just an inevitable step in the growth of Jito Network. It would not have been possible without the support of Jito supporters, JitoSOL stakers, and all the DeFi protocols on Solana, as well as the engineers working to make Solana an ideal place to build.”
Jito prepares to compete in the restaking market
Jito is also exploring the development of a restaking protocol, as reported by CoinDesk, citing four sources close to the matter. 
This positioning could allow Jito to enter the restaking market, which currently has a TVL of 15.2 billion dollars, with EigenLayer dominating with 14.7 billion dollars.
As for the TVL of Solana, we see that, after touching a minimum of 210 million dollars during the bear market of 2022, it has risen to 3.7 billion dollars, with a growth of about 150% since the beginning of the year.
However, it remains significantly below the all-time high of over 10 billion dollars reached in November 2021.
Jito’s crypto, JTO, reaches new highs 
JTO, the native cryptocurrency of the Jito network, is experiencing a period of strong growth. In the last few weeks, its price has increased by 10%, reaching 3.88 dollars, with a market capitalization of over 450 million dollars. 
This increase follows a recent fluctuation that brought the value of JTO above 5 dollars, followed by a sharp drop to 3.15 dollars, with a subsequent recovery that allowed JTO to rise over 20% from the April low.
Parallel to the increase in price, the open interest of JTO has risen significantly on all major cryptocurrency exchanges, with an increase between 20% and 45% on platforms like Binance, OKX, and Bitget. 
This increase in open interest is a key indicator of market sentiment, suggesting that the bullish trend may continue. 
Indeed, as we know, when open interest grows along with prices, it can indicate greater momentum and greater confidence from investors.
Jito offers a series of advantages to investors, including the possibility of converting SOL into JitoSOL to maintain liquidity and earn staking rewards, as well as obtaining additional benefits from MEV.
We remind you that MEV refers to profit opportunities resulting from transaction ordering, which can be exploited through arbitrage techniques. 
The Jito Foundation was created to address the challenges related to the EVS, promoting a fair distribution of profits and ensuring greater transparency. 
In addition, Jito has developed an open source validation client to promote greater competitiveness in the MEV extraction sector on Solana.

The Secret Behind How AI-Powered Ethereum Trades Made This Trader a Millionaire

Editorial Note: The following content does not reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions. 
With the introduction of artificial intelligence in the investment sector, people are changing the way they invest in volatile cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. An industry that once required traders to learn complex market dynamics and study the plethora of crypto projects can now be entered into with minimal knowledge and experience.
Among several hundred newly launched AI-based trading platforms, AlgosOne’s AI trading bot has been gaining popularity over the past months. The trading bot sets itself apart from its competitors by assuring a trade rate of up to 80% with minimal user input.
Naomi Ross – a corporate executive – is one of the many AlgosOne users who achieved remarkable results through Ethereum trading. Excited to see what AI-powered trading can do for you? Try out AlgosOne’s 14-day risk-free trial!

How Did Naomi Discover the Algosone AI Trading Bot?
Naomi Ross, at 45, is a high-ranking executive at a multinational corporation. Despite the success of her career, Naomi was keen to grow her savings beyond the limitations of traditional investment options. However, even outside the boardroom, being equally committed to her family, she barely had any time to explore financial markets and the intricacies of trading in her schedule.
After her brief research about the cryptocurrency space, Naomi’s attention was caught by Ethereum, particularly its evolving decentralized ecosystem and solid potential for institutional adoption. Yet, cryptocurrency trading of all sorts, due to its highly volatile nature and the need for constant market monitoring, seemed overwhelming.
Naomi’s initial attempt to enter the cryptocurrency market was met with the same challenges faced by many new investors. While looking for platforms, she came across AlgosOne – an AI-powered trading bot designed specifically for new traders with little to no knowledge about the industry. What initially intrigued her was the way AlgosOne implements artificial intelligence and machine learning in its core technology to manage investments.


The platform utilizes deep neural networks and natural language processing models, similar to GPT-4 and LLaMA, to digest and analyze various data sources. This data includes historical and real-time market information, price movements, relevant news articles, and social media sentiments. By analyzing these complex sets of data, AlgosOne’s AI is able to dissect the market and identify patterns and trends. This enables the trading bot to execute trades with an incredible success rate of more than 80% while minimizing the risk.
Her Experience Trading Crypto With AlgosOne
The primary factor that convinced Naomi to try out AlgosOne’s AI trading was the platform’s ability to carry out trades autonomously without the need for user input. Unlike traditional trading strategies that demand constant monitoring and active decision-making based on extended market analysis, AlgosOne offers a hands-off approach. This resonated with Naomi’s busy schedule, allowing her to focus on her career and family while AlgosOne did the heavy lifting, managing her Ethereum investments with a profit margin.

“Let’s be honest, initially, I was skeptical. AI managing my investments? That too in an extremely volatile asset like Ethereum? It sounded too good to be true,” confessed Naomi. “But the low minimum deposit requirement convinced me to give it a shot. At the start, I put in just $300 to test the waters. And honestly, the whole experience has been much simpler than I expected. I didn’t have to become a crypto expert – the AI took care of everything for me.”
AlgosOne is determined to make the user experience as streamlined and worry-free as possible. Investors are only required to register their accounts and deposit their funds. Beyond that, AlgosOne’s AI takes care of everything, meticulously analyzing the price action data for assets like Ethereum and capitalizing on optimal opportunities with precision. On top of the automation, to make crypto trading more accessible for new investors, AlgosOne’s minimum deposit is only $300.
To top it all off, the platform also provides a commitment-free 14-day free trial, which you can avail of right now!
Making Millions From Crypto Trading

“My initial doubts were soon gone when AlgosOne earned me far more profit on my $300 investment than I expected. I was genuinely surprised to see the trading bot perform so well with my nominal Ethereum investment,” said Naomi, sharing her experience.
AlgosOne’s success rate of over 80% for crypto trading, as well as other markets such as forex and stocks, is yet to be beaten by any other competitor platform. AlgosOne’s underlying infrastructure uses a data-driven approach and is able to shift to the market conditions. By analyzing the historical and current market data streams in real time, the AI is able to recognize price patterns across both shorter and broader timeframes.
Moreover, as the platform processes new information and experiences, the AI model refines its predictive capabilities over time. As a result, despite the rapid fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market, AlgosOne is able to pinpoint entry and exit positions as well as trade size for opportunities with optimal profit-to-risk ratios. 
For instance, even in high-risk market situations, where, let’s say, the win-loss ratio is 50%, the trading bot will smartly allocate only a small portion of the total investment compared to a much safer trade where the profit probability is about 90%. This adaptive nature of the platform enables it to maximize profits and minimize risk in rising and falling markets alike.
“Once I saw AlgosOne consistently turning a profit, I knew this wasn’t just luck. The AI was making smart decisions, and my returns were growing steadily. That’s when I decided to put more skin in the game and reinvest a larger sum,” remarked Naomi.


“AlgosOne’s trading tier system made perfect sense – the more I invested, the more benefits I unlocked. I could access bigger trades, which meant potentially larger returns. At the same time, the fees went down, much lower than most trading bots I came across. It felt like a win-win situation. And, let me tell you, that decision paid off in a big way. My initial investment grew  far exceeding anything I’d ever achieved with my traditional investment portfolio.”
Conclusion
Naomi Ross’s story – from scepticism to making money – is a testament to AlgosOne’s ability to empower traders, even those with no prior experience and knowledge, to achieve success in the cryptocurrency market. The platform’s approach to making trades based on in-depth market data analysis allows users to stay ahead of the curve and profit on fleeting market opportunities with minimum manual work.
“AlgosOne gave me the tools and confidence to navigate crypto assets like Ethereum, even with my busy schedule. The results speak for themselves.”

Therefore, he published a thread to clarify his prediction.Martinez explained that the correction Dogecoin is currently undergoing is normal for this meme coin and has been observed before DOGE broke into a bull run in the past. He referred to 2017, when DOGE broke out of a descending triangle pattern. In that year, the meme coin dumped 40% before it started on a massive 982% bull run. A similar scenario played out in 2021 – a retracement by 56% occurred before a 12,197% surge and the all-time high. Currently, Dogecoin has again broken out of a similar pattern and is expected to ignite a bull run.

Fear Back For 1st Time Since October As Crypto Greed Takes The Backseat


								The luster appears to have faded from Bitcoin’s crown. After a stellar run culminating in a record-breaking price in late March, the world’s leading cryptocurrency has experienced a sharp correction, plunging investor sentiment into the abyss. This sudden shift can be attributed to a confluence of factors, with the “Fear and Greed Index” playing a fascinating role in this rollercoaster ride, alongside a record exodus from a key investment vehicle.

Bitcoin And The Fear Gauge: A Delicate Dance
The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a sentiment analysis tool that attempts to capture the overall emotional temperature of the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 signifying “Extreme Fear” and 100 representing “Extreme Greed.” This psychological barometer plays a surprisingly significant role in Bitcoin’s price movements.

Source: Alternative.me
During Bitcoin’s ascent to its peak, the Fear and Greed Index hovered comfortably in the “Greed” zone. This instilled a sense of euphoria among investors, encouraging a “buy the dip” mentality. Every price drop was seen as a buying opportunity, further fueling the upward momentum.
However, the recent price plunge triggered a dramatic shift in sentiment. The index plummeted to a value of 43, firmly entering the “Fear” zone. This sudden lurch towards pessimism triggered a wave of panic selling, as investors fearful of further losses rushed to offload their holdings.

The Fear and Greed Index, while a valuable tool, can become a self-fulfilling prophecy in volatile markets like Bitcoin. When fear dominates the market sentiment, it can trigger a domino effect. As investors see the index dip, their own anxieties rise, leading them to sell their Bitcoin holdings.
This selling pressure then pushes the price down further, reinforcing the initial fear and prompting further selloffs. This cyclical pattern can exacerbate price corrections, creating a negative feedback loop.

Beyond The Fear: Market Fundamentals And Long-Term Outlook
While the short-term picture for Bitcoin appears gloomy, some analysts believe this is a necessary correction following the rapid run-up preceding the halving event. The halving, which reduces the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation every block, had fueled speculation and a buying frenzy. However, with the event now in the past, the market is adjusting to the new reality.
Adding Fuel To The Fire: Record Outflows From Spot Bitcoin ETFs
Further compounding the woes of Bitcoin is a record exodus from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On May 1st, a staggering $560 million net outflow was recorded from these investment vehicles.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price without directly owning the cryptocurrency. This record outflow signifies a significant loss of confidence among some institutional investors, potentially spooking retail investors as well.
Despite the current turbulence, long-term Bitcoin believers remain optimistic. They point to the cryptocurrency’s underlying fundamentals, such as its decentralized nature and limited supply, as reasons for its long-term potential. However, the road to recovery might be bumpy, and investors should be prepared for further volatility in the near future.

UK gov't calls for action on AI copyright, market competition

The United Kingdom government’s response to a parliamentary report on artificial intelligence (AI) resulted in a demand for closer intervention.A House of Lords February report on generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) highlighted the government’s narrowing focus on high‑stakes AI safety, which works as a deterrent to international competition.In response to the report, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, Michelle Donelan, clarified the government’s AI oversight is in line with most of the parliamentary recommendations. However, Lords Member Baroness Stowell of Beeston (Tina Stowell) wrote back on May 2, asking the U.K. government to “go beyond its current position” on the way it handles copyright infringement and market competition in AI.Baroness Stowell, the Chair of the Communications and Digital Committee, House of Lords, pointed out the need for updated copyright legislation. She said:“On copyright, the Government has set up and subsequently disbanded a failed series of roundtables led by the Intellectual Property Office. The commitment to ministerial engagement is helpful but the next steps have been left unclear.”Stowell further expressed her disappointment in the government’s lack of commitment to enhanced governance measures for AI standards and policy decisions. She also recommended policy discussions around oversight of market competition.“We reiterate our suggestion that market competition is made an explicit policy objective: it should be embedded within the design and review process for new policies and standards, and subject to structured internal and external critique.”The U.K. government’s recent response to the parliamentary signals a new acceptance of regulatory reforms for AI. Related: Crypto firms among ‘greatest risks’ for money laundering in 2022-2023: UK govtThe U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) and police were recently authorized to “seize, freeze, and destroy” cryptocurrencies related to crime proceedings without formal arrests.Home Secretary James Cleverly said that criminals must not profit from illegal activities. Cleverly cited crypto fundraising by groups as the rationale behind the new police powers.“These reforms will also enhance our national security. Terrorist organisations like Daesh are known to raise funds through crypto transactions and these updated powers will enable our agencies to more easily strip them of their assets.”The new regulations were implemented following the passage of a crime bill by the U.K. parliament in 2023, which facilitated the rapid seizure of cryptocurrency.Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

Nigerian fintechs crack down on crypto, users face account blocks

Some Nigerian fintech platforms have warned users against connecting their platforms with crypto transactions or face heavy sanctions amid the country’s ongoing efforts to regulate cryptocurrency.Nigerian fintech firms Moniepoint, PalmPay and Paga have notified customers that their accounts will be blocked if they facilitate crypto transactions with them. This comes after the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) ordered some new banks, including Moniepoint, to stop onboarding new customers. In the notification issued to customers on May 2, 2024, Moniepoint said:“In line with CBN regulation, we will close the account of anyone engaging in crypto or other virtual assets transactions and share their details with relevant authorities.”This notification marks a reversal of the Central Bank of Nigeria’s previous announcement to lift the crypto ban imposed in 2021. In the CBN circular issued in December 2023, the central bank directed financial institutions to facilitate account opening, provide designated settlement services, and act as intermediaries for firms engaging in crypto asset transactions.Source: Tola Joseph FadugbagbeThe December circular also stated that it supersedes the one from 2017 and the one from 2021, which restricted banks and other financial institutions from operating accounts for cryptocurrency service providers. An X user, who is also a PalmPay customer, said his account was frozen and would only be unfrozen if he agreed to sign an agreement mandating him to abstain from crypto transactions.Related: Nigerian court postpones money laundering trial of Binance and execsPaga also emailed customers, stating that it is licensed by the CBN and that it is committed to compliance with all CBN regulations.“Pursuant to the CBN circular with reference FPR/DIR/GEN/CIR/06/10, we wish to remind you that dealing in or facilitating transactions in cryptocurrency and other virtual currencies is not permitted.”The circular referenced by Paga is from 2017, and it warns banks and other financial institutions about their relations with crypto exchanges and customers who transact cryptocurrency. The CBN had earlier denied a report saying it issued a directive requiring all banks and financial institutions to identify individuals or entities engaging in transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges and to ensure that such accounts are put on Post No Debit (PND) instruction — a directive issued by a bank or financial institution to restrict certain transactions on a customer’s account — for six months.The alleged circular also stated that regulated financial institutions engaged in crypto or facilitating payments for crypto exchanges are prohibited.

Friend.Tech's Native Token FRIEND Tanks to $2.5 After Airdrop

"Most users got 10x less airdrop than what they were expecting, so they are not even claiming that airdrop, as its less than 200$ for most of the retail investors," Malviya told CoinDesk in a direct message on X. "But at the same time few people ended up making crazy amount. So its a clear case of very concentred airdrop where leading creators took the most supply home through airdrop, leaving retail in disguise."

Michael Saylor Presents Bitcoin as the Best Crypto Asset


							

Michael Saylor describes Bitcoin as the best crypto asset, with no other second-best asset.



MicroStrategy CEO hails Bitcoin as the single solution for capital appreciation in an inflationary environment.



Saylor points out the key differences between Bitcoin and altcoins, highlighting the significance of proof-of-work-based consensus.




Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, the largest public holder of Bitcoin, spotted Bitcoin as the best crypto asset ever, with no other second-best asset. In a keynote address delivered at “MicroStrategy World: Bitcoin for Corporations,” Saylor presented Bitcoin as the “single solution” for capital appreciation in an inflationary environment.



Saylor shared insights on Bitcoin’s price appreciation and continued monetization. Reflecting on Greek philosopher Archimedes’ words, “Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand and I can move the world,” Saylor added, “Bitcoin is the place to stand.” Further, presenting Bitcoin as “the best,” Saylor asserted,




 “There’s no more powerful idea than the digital transformation of capital… No force on earth can stop an idea whose time has come. This is an idea. Its time has come. It’s unstoppable. And so I’m going to end with the observation that Bitcoin is the best. The best what? The best.” 




Explaining the major differences between Bitcoin and alternative coins, known as Altcoins, Saylor highlighted the significance of proof-of-work-based consensus in the crypto space. Providing further details into the matter, the MicroStrategy Chairman used the example of Bitcoin ETFs and Ether ETFs. While Spot ETFs were approved and successfully launched, the launch of Ether ETFs still remains a question. He stated,




 “When Ethereum is not going to be approved, sometime this summer it’ll be very clear to everyone that Ethereum is deemed a crypto asset security, not a commodity. After that, you’re going to see that [for] Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano – everything down the stack.”




Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading below the $60k mark despite a slight recovery from the bearish track. Currently trading at $59,551, BTC has experienced a marginal surge of 3% in one day. However, the cryptocurrency has declined by 7% in one week and 10% in one month.

Important Ripple v. SEC Lawsuit Update: Here's How the Trial's Going


																TL;DR

Ripple contests the SEC’s classification of the “Fox Declaration” as standard evidence, arguing it’s expert testimony, which affects the legal proceedings.
Predictions suggest a possible $100 million settlement in case, potentially impacting XRP’s value and the broader crypto market.


Ripple Strikes Back
The legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) escalated recently due to a disagreement on one key witness’ testimony. The two entities can not find common ground on a statement from Andrea Fox (known as the “Fox Declaration”).
The company initially argued that the testimony represented an unsolicited expert opinion, while the regulator described the process as “standard summary evidence in support of calculations for disgorgement.” 
The Commission also claimed that the “Fox Declaration” consists of information derived from documents generated by Ripple itself, including tax returns and financial statements, which can be useful for determining the case’s outcome.
Most recently, the firm filed a letter in further support of its initial request. It maintained that the SEC failed to show that the “Fox Declaration” is summary evidence rather than expert testimony. 




“Fox is an expert because she purports to use technical or other specialized knowledge to help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. She does not merely apply basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records, as the SEC contends.
 Rather, she analyzes Ripple’s records, third-party evidence, and expert reports; draws inferences and conclusions about those documents; and calculates disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and discount amounts based on her analysis.”
The company went further, arguing that even if Andrea Fox could be classified as a summary witness (rather than an expert), the SEC failed to disclose her before the end of the discovery process.
Having that said, Ripple insisted that the testimony should not be taken into account when determining the case’s resolution. 
Is a Settlement on the Horizon?
Despite the start of the trial, it remains unclear when the Ripple v SEC case will be officially closed or whether the parties will shake hands on a mutual agreement. One person who predicted the second scenario is the American lawyer, Jeremy Hogan. He thinks the lawsuit may draw to an end this summer following a $100 million settlement.
“I’m saying that the Judge will order 0 disgorgement but throws the SEC a bone and orders Ripple to pay a $100 million penalty,” Hogan stated.
Recall that the watchdog sought a $2 billion fine on the company alleging XRP sales violations. The latter insisted that the penalty should not exceed $10 million.
The outcome of the case might trigger a substantial price rally on Ripple’s native token and the entire crypto market (in the event of a decisive victory for the firm). On the other hand, the sector could be negatively affected if the SEC emerges victorious.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Eyes $60K, Toncoin (TON) Soars 12% Daily (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price recovery attempts continued in the past 24 hours as the asset neared $60,000 for the first time in days but failed to overcome that line.
The altcoins are also slightly in the green, with ETH closing down on $3,000, while SOL has neared $140.
BTC Goes for $60K
The primary cryptocurrency experienced several quite brutal days in which its price dropped by more than eight grand. It all started quite positively actually as BTC soared to nearly $65,000 during the early trading days of the Morning Asian session.
However, the bears intercepted the move at this point and propelled the first decline of many. In a matter of hours, bitcoin found itself dumping to under $62,000 and to $60,000 later that day.
The pressure kept mounting and BTC lost that physiological support level. This culminated in another massive nosedive that drove the cryptocurrency to a multi-month low of $56,500 on Wednesday morning, ahead of the highly-anticipated US FOMC meeting.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


Once that concluded, BTC jumped by two grand as the Fed said it will not raise the interest rates any further, but lost those gains immediately. It wasn’t until yesterday when the asset finally started to regain some traction and pumped to $60,000 hours ago.
It was stopped there and was pushed down to about $59,200 as of now. Its market cap has increased to $1.166 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts is slightly above 50%.

TON Steals the Show
Most altcoins suffered quite badly as well at the start of the business week but charted impressive gains yesterday. Some, such as Toncoin, have doubled down. TON has soared by nearly 12% in the past 24 hours again and now sits above $5.3.
HBAR, IMX, PEPE, TAO, and CRO have also produced impressive increases in the past day.
Ethereum is close to $3,300 after a 1.5% daily increase, SOL has neared $140 following a 3.7% surge, and DOGE is above $0.13 after gaining 4%.
The total crypto market cap has recovered another $40 billion since yesterday and is up to $2.330 trillion on CG.

R. Kiyosaki warns ‘the crash has begun’ and it is ‘a bad one’


Amid his numerous warnings of an upcoming financial crash, famous investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ Robert Kiyosaki has now shifted the narrative, stating that the crash has already begun and listing his rules to remember during this time.
As it happens, Kiyosaki specified that the bad news was that this crash “will be a bad one,” but the good news was that “crashes are the best time to get rich,” as “bargains will float to the surface,” according to the X post that the popular finance educator published on May 3.
On top of that, he offered the six main rules to remember in a crash, which include:


#1 Don’t catch falling knives
According to Kiyosaki, patience is a virtue, and greediness is a flaw during a crash, even when there are bargains are dropping left and right, therefore he advises “just because prices are falling, do not get greedy,” and “wait until prices have bottomed and no one wants the asset you want.”

For instance, in late March, Kiyosaki highlighted that the price of silver at the time was still well below its all-time high (ATH), praising it as the best bargain as it was “not only a precious metal” but also “an industrial metal and a strategic metal” with soaring demand due to wars erupting all over the world.
#2 Study
As someone who has always touted the importance of financial education, Kiyosaki believes it is particularly important during a crisis, recommending YouTube as a “great source for real and fake teachers” and to “invest time to get into the heads of the teacher.”
Indeed, he earlier warned that fiscal stupidity and lack of financial education in the United States were the biggest threats to the country, referring to traditional teachers as bureaucrats who lack the competence to teach their students about finances and the economy.
#3 New friends
Furthermore, Kiyosaki urges his followers to “seek new friends who are on the same path you are on.” In other words, he advises staying away from victims – “people who blame others for their problems,” and Marxists – “people who expect the government to solve their problems.”
Specifically, he has earlier slammed the current government in the US, headed by President Joe Biden, as ‘Marxist,’ arguing that they  “took over the US in the 2020 election [and]will raise property taxes, impose rent controls, as rising interest rates decrease property values.”
#4 Start a side hustle
Also, he praises self-sufficiency, which involves owning “your own business,” particularly as artificial intelligence (AI) “is going to wipe out millions of jobs.” Hence, he recommends starting a small business and becoming an entrepreneur instead of being an “employee afraid of losing their job.”
Indeed, Kiyosaki has argued that a side hustle may “provide you income (…) as the economy crashes, stock markets go bust, pensions crash and unemployment rises” and might even “grow into the next Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) or Bitcoin (BTC),” as Finbold reported in late 2022.
#5 Choose great teachers
Closely connected to his rule #2, Kiyosaki believes that “YouTube has an abundance of teachers, some good, many bad,” telling his followers to choose his own teachers, including Ken McElroy for real estate, Tom Wheelwright for tax strategy, John MacGregor for stocks, and Mike Mauceli for oil, adding:

“Be careful who influences your brain, your attitude, and your spirit.”

As a reminder, he has earlier admitted that his whole family were school teachers, arguing that this is how he knew that “they’re all basically bureaucrats [and financially] stupid,” and that, as such, no one should trust school teachers or take financial advice from them.
#6 Don’t save money
Finally, he argues against saving “fake money” or fiat currencies like the US dollar, Euro, Yen, or Peso, as it “goes down in value,” suggesting instead to “save gold, silver, [and] Bitcoin,” in other words, “real money that goes up in value, especially in a market crash.”
In fact, Kiyosaki has previously pointed out that “the rich save gold, silver, Bitcoin” while “the poor and middle class want jobs that promise a steady paycheck but offer no job security,” and “fake $,” which they invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, & [exchange-traded funds (ETFs)].”
Conclusion
All things considered, Robert Kiyosaki has long warned about the looming threat of a worldwide financial collapse, particularly in the US, where the “fake” dollar is eroding the global dominance and pushing the American empire to its end.” However, only time will tell if and just how correct he was in his predictions.

Bonk: The Solana Meme Coin Phenomenon Shaking Up the Crypto World - Brave New Coin

The meme coin named Bonk Coin, based on the Solana blockchain, has gained significant attention and stirred up the cryptocurrency market.
Bonk is a type of meme coin, similar in spirit to Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, but it operates on the Solana network, which is known for its high-speed transactions and lower costs compared to Ethereum.
Bonk reportedly gained traction as a reaction to the perceived centralization and venture capital influence in the Solana ecosystem. It was distributed in a unique manner, with a significant portion of its total supply given away to Solana users, NFT projects, and developers, ostensibly to foster a more community-focused approach.
This token experienced substantial volatility shortly after its launch, showcasing both rapid increases in value and sharp declines, typical of many meme-based cryptocurrencies. This volatility reflects the speculative nature of such assets, where market prices can be heavily influenced by social media trends, community sentiment, and influencer endorsements.
What is Bonk Coin?
Bonk coin is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, designed to promote fair distribution and reduce the perceived centralization and venture capital influence in the Solana ecosystem.
When was Bonk Coin created?
Launched on Christmas Day, December 25, 2022, Bonk coin was initially distributed as a free airdrop specifically targeted at the Solana community. This strategic move was aimed at fostering widespread adoption and encouraging community participation within the Solana ecosystem
How does Bonk work?
As a meme coin, Bonk relies heavily on community involvement and sentiment. It leverages a decentralized approach where decisions can be influenced by community votes, especially through mechanisms like a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This ensures that token holders can have a say in significant decisions regarding the project’s future.
Bonk Use Cases
While initially starting as a meme coin, Bonk aims to expand its utility in various ways:
Tipping and Microtransactions: Users can use Bonk for small transactions or as a tipping currency within the Solana ecosystem, encouraging interactions and rewards among community members.
Participation in DeFi: Bonk can be integrated into various DeFi platforms for staking, lending, or liquidity provision, providing its holders with opportunities to earn interest or other rewards.
NFT Marketplaces: Bonk coins might be used in NFT marketplaces integrated with Solana for buying, selling, or trading digital assets, enhancing its utility beyond mere speculation.
Bonk Current Tokenomics

Circulating Supply: 65.19 trillion BONK
Total and Max Supply: 93.53 trillion BONK
Current Market Cap: $990.72 million


Bonk Tokenomics Distribution 
Choosing the Right Wallet for Your Bonk Coin and Other Tokens

To manage your Bonk coin and other digital assets, selecting a wallet that best fits your security and functionality needs is crucial. Whether you prefer a wallet dedicated to the Solana ecosystem or a more versatile multi chain wallet, there are several reliable options available:
Phantom Wallet: Ideal for those heavily invested in the Solana network, Phantom Wallet allows for efficient management of Solana-based assets like Bonk coin. It supports various DeFi and NFT functionalities integral to the Solana blockchain.
Klever Wallet: For those seeking a multi-chain wallet, Klever offers a comprehensive solution with support for multiple blockchains. Klever Wallet is available as a mobile app, browser extension, and even a hardware wallet, catering to various levels of security needs. This makes it an excellent choice for managing a diverse portfolio, including Bonk coin, with features facilitating easy swapping and secure storage. For more information, check out the Bonk Wallet on Klever Wallet’s website.
Trust Wallet: As a user-friendly multi chain wallet, Trust Wallet supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies across different blockchains, making it ideal for those who prefer having all their assets in one place.
MetaMask: While primarily known for its integration with Ethereum, MetaMask also supports other blockchains through custom RPCs, making it a flexible option for managing a variety of tokens.
By choosing a wallet that aligns with your needs, whether it’s focused on a specific blockchain like Solana or supports multiple chains, you can ensure that your cryptocurrencies are secure and accessible. Always remember to keep your private keys and seed phrases in a secure location and consider using additional security measures like two-factor authentication to protect your assets.

SHIB Shows Meme Token Resilience, Hard Fork Expected to Add New Features | Cryptopolitan

SHIB survived the worst of this week’s correction, and even briefly rallied along with Dogecoin (DOGE). But SHIB goes beyond the pure meme narrative of tokens like BONK, SLERF, Dogwifhat and FLOKI. SHIB traded at $0.000023, its mid-range level for the past month. SHIB also shows it can rally from every dip in the past weeks, with trading volumes often surpassing $1B. The momentum from the past days may extend and cover the weekly loss gap for SHIB.Shiba Inu remains a volatile project with inherent risk. But it is also one of the meme coins with the highest ambition to also become a Web3 hub, serving decentralized finance, as well as games and NFT collections and airdrops. Shiba Inu Prepares for Two-Stage Hard ForkShuba Inu completed the first stage of the Shibarium hard fork, planned for May 2 at block height 4,504,576. The Bor hard fork, as it is known, improves the efficiency of block production and communication between block operators. After the hard fork, the Shibarium network will introduce a small lag to synchronize nodes and avoid conflicting states of the blockchain.The second stage, the Heimdall hard fork, was scheduled for May 3, 12:30 EST, at block height 3,941,864. The Heimdall fork has improvements for the finalizing layer of Shibarium, where transactions become truly immutable. What is the Shibarium NetworkThe Shibarium network is gaining importance as the native transaction layer for the ShibaInu project. The network already carries more than 1.7M wallets, while SHIB tokens on the Ethereum network are held in 1.4M wallets.As of May 2024, SHIB is a two-chain token, but it still requires manual bridging from its various versions. Shibarium also tries to optimize fees so that its network becomes more attractive. Nonetheless, people continue to use SHIB in its Ethereum-based version for trading, allowing them to deposit it into centralized exchanges.The Shibarium network is supported by 100 Validator Nodes. Each node operator must hold at least 10,000 BONE tokens, often collected from the community of delegators. Validator nodes payout rewards and try to retain delegators with favorable payouts.SHIB Shows Signs of GrowthShiba Inu is now working to grow the Shibarium ecosystem and turn it into a successful scaling solution. Shiba Inu is also going through a fee-burning program, which also indicates usage levels. In April, Shiba Inu achieved the highest burn rate for the past three months, showing an expansion of transactions. The project has integrated Ethereum’s Shanghai hard fork upgrades and will keep evolving with future hard forks. The network’s growth and upgrades serve to remove the status of a non-serious project, as SHIB aims to have utility and multiple use cases. Already, Shibarium carries several small emerging DEX markets, as well as a Shibarium domain name service, similar to Ethereum addresses.Shiba Inu Prepares for Privacy LayerShiba Inu added a new token to its portfolio, the reward asset TREAT. The intention was for TREAT to work through a confidential layer of the Shibarium network. TREAT is added to the whole Shiba Inu ecosystem of tokens, which includes SHIB, BONE, LEASH, as well as the SHI stablecoin. Shiba Inu found additional funding for the TREAT token, raising $12M in April. TREAT also draws in new buyers from other blockchain projects.The TREAT token launched in 2023 and started active trading in March, when it reached its all-time high. On May 3, TREAT traded at $0.00085, showing its ability to bounce and achieve significant gains in the short term.

Friend.Tech Upgrade Launches With Native Token in Epic V2 Push



Decentralized social network Friend.Tech just bagged a new upgrade by pushing out its new naive token for trading on its native decentralized exchange on the Base network. According to DexScreener, the new token is currently trading at $3 with a total circulating supply of 14.5 million.

It was earlier rumored that Friend Tech is possibly considering introducing a non-transferable token with the ticker POINTS. The information was based on a leaked smart contract related to the version 2 launch of Friend.Tech, scheduled for May 3. Aside from the POINTS token, the V2 launch was expected to come with a new smart contract feature called Clubs.
“New smart-contract called Clubs. Anyone can create multiple clubs and a bonding curve among several options,” said @Cbb0fe, the X user who first talked about the token launch. “1.5% platform fee and 1.5% staking contract. Club keys are bought with $POINT.”




The token airdrop eventually coincided with the launch of Friend.Tech’s version 2 and it came with the Clubs feature.
The 1.5% fee on every transaction will go to liquidity providers on its DEX. Users are required to join one Club and follow a minimum of 10 users on Friend.Tech to gain access to their airdropped POINTS token. With the launch of POINTS, Friend Tech’s  native token FRIEND has slumped to $2.5, down from a high of $169.
Friend.Tech Suffers Sign Drop in Transaction
This V2 launch marks a re-emergence for the Web3.0 social media platform after it dealt a huge blow a few months ago. The protocol was launched in August 2023 after which it generated protocol fees of $1.42 million within just 24 hours. At this time, DefiLlama data confirmed that the achievement placed Friend Tech ahead of Tron and Uniswap.
This further highlighted its development as an emerging prominent protocol in the crypto space. In a period of two weeks, the platform allegedly registered over 100,000 users and generated about $25 million. Friend Tech’s core proposition lies in its novel approach to turning social connections into tradable assets. Users can tokenize their social networks by purchasing shares of other users’ profiles.
Unfortunately, the network saw a significant drop in transactions in less than one month of its official launch. Its daily fees plummeted on August 26 by about 87% and rested at $225,000. Daily trading volume on the platform plunged from $16.9 million to $953,000. Transactions on Friend. tech also fell by over 90% from its peak on August 21.
This bearish outlook impacted negatively on the decentralized social network. Even the former President of Polygon Labs Ryan Wyatt justifiably described Friend.Tech as a Ponzi scheme that cannot retain customers.


The relaunch is likely a major step towards correcting the negative narrative surrounding Friend.tech.

Ripple Will Lose Motion To Stop The SEC’s Opposition Filing - Lawyer


							

Bill Morgan, thinks Ripple will lose its “Motion to Strike” filing in the ongoing lawsuit against the SEC.



Morgan believes the Judge would accept Adrea Fox’s evidence and allow Ripple to depose her.



Ripple filed a letter supporting its April 22, 2024 motion to strike new expert materials.




Foremost crypto lawyer Bill Morgan thinks Ripple will lose its “Motion to Strike” filing in the ongoing lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Morgan highlighted this in a recent post on X, noting that he believes the Judge will accept the SEC’s summary witness Andrea Fox’s evidence as an expert and permit Ripple to depose her.







According to Morgan, following the series of events, the public can wait to see what the SEC would say on May 6 in its reply brief on remedies and await the Court’s remedies decision. Morgan’s post followed reports that Ripple had filed a letter supporting its April 22 motion to strike new expert materials. The letter also serves as a reply to the SEC’s April 29 opposition to Ripple’s earlier motion to strike.



In the referenced letter, Ripple highlighted that the SEC failed to show that Fox is summary evidence rather than expert testimony. The fintech firm also argued that the witness’s testimony was not timely under the Court’s scheduling order.



In further explanation, Ripple noted that the SEC does not dispute that if Fox is an expert, it had to serve a report from her during remedies discovery. The blockchain firm also highlighted that the parties’ agreement and the Court’s scheduling order required the SEC to disclose Fox before the close of discovery, citing a joint letter by the parties.









Ripple is in a prolonged litigation with the SEC over its XRP sales over the years. The case has directly impacted XRP’s price, following unstable sentiments among the XRP community. On Thursday, the top altcoin surged about 4% in a surprise move as the community anticipated Ripple’s latest filing.  



XRP traded for $0.51873 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView, with the crypto market showing signs of a momentum loss going into the weekend.

Bold Statements About Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Altcoins from Bitcoin Bull Michael Saylor! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The long-standing debate about whether Ethereum is a commodity or a security was recently brought to court.
While the SEC claims that ETH is a security, Ethereum development company Consensys recently stated in the lawsuit it filed against the SEC that ETH is not a security.



At this point, while many comments have been made about ETH, the latest evaluation came from MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, known for his support for Bitcoin.
Saylor, who made surprising statements about Ethereum, claimed that ETH is a security.





Speaking at the MicroStrategy World 2024 conference yesterday, Saylor argued that the largest altcoin is a security, not a commodity.
Michael Saylor went further, stating that the SEC will classify Ethereum as a security this summer and reject spot Ethereum ETFs.


Saylor believes that the SEC will classify many altcoins other than ETH as securities, such as BNB, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP.

“Ethereum should be considered a security, not a commodity. After ETH, you will see that many altcoins such as BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano are also unregistered securities.”
The SEC will not approve any spot ETH ETFs. Ethereum and other altcoins, which are securities, will never be accepted by Wall Street. “None of them will be accepted as cryptocurrencies by mainstream institutional investors.”

After these statements, the famous name also touched upon Bitcoin and argued that Bitcoin is the only leading cryptocurrency in institutional acceptance. Saylor described BTC as the “only universal” cryptocurrency suitable for institutional-level investments and added that there will be no other cryptocurrency than Bitcoin.

Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patent

Crypto community members expressed differing opinions as Ethereum Name Service (ENS) officially challenged a United States patent granted to Unstoppable Domains (UD) in January 2023. On May 2, ENS petitioned the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to challenge the validity of the UD patent. The company said that this move aims to ensure that the web “remains a collaborative space.” Source: ENSENS believes that UD has patented the technology that they pioneered. “This isn’t flattery — it’s theft. We have to fight this to ensure that ENS remains unrestricted for all,” ENS wrote.ENS also added that their organization “thrives on decentralization and public benefit.” According to the firm, the UD patent threatens to distort or destroy their core vision and beliefs. This includes the belief that core web functions must be free and not barricaded by patents. Some crypto community members supported ENS’ move against UD, while others argued against the petition. Cinneamhain Ventures’ Adam Cochran believes that the UD patent is not valid. Cochran argued that blockchain names, which were designed by ENS, must remain a perpetual public good and open intellectual property. “One of the critical values in this space is building in the open and not creating IP capture,” Cochran added. Decentralized finance (DeFi) advocates at the DeFi Education Fund also expressed their support for ENS. The organization said that it aligns with ENS in advocating and advancing open-source protocols. But a crypto community member argued that ENS has “nothing left for them but to attack UD.” The X user alleged that ENS “incite their friends not to work with UD” and said that the organization exhausts investors with high fees. Another X user said that this is an attempt from ENS to gaslight. The community member argued that patents are not granted without due process. The X user also urged ENS to keep the petition on the court and not on X. Related: ENS data from Etherscan now visible in Google search resultsUnstoppable Domains founder Matthew Gould responded to ENS on X and said that ENS was cited on the patent along with other blockchain domain systems. The UD founder said that the patent was reviewed with these citations and is valid.

However, Gould did not post further responses to ENS and Johnson. Magazine: AI didn’t kill the metaverse, it will build it — Alien Worlds, Bittensor vs Eric Wall: AI Eye

Update! EIGEN Foundation makes new announcements on EIGEN Stakedrop | Cryptopolitan

Opinions on the EIGEN Stakedrop have flooded Crypto Twitter after its recent launch. Some excited, some cautious, and all in all, the Eigen Foundation is continuing to benefit from large media coverage and engagements on Twitter. The Eigen Foundation recently launched the EIGEN token and released a detailed outline for its stakedrop. However, after the announcements, the community responded back to the Eigen Foundation with multiple complaints about the high gas fees and a stingy approach to EIGEN token distribution, among others. Today, the Eigen Foundation has responded to the valuable feedback from its community and there’s some good news for those who’ve been interacting with EigenLayer. In response, the Eigen Foundation will be giving away an additional 100 EIGEN tokens to more than 280,000 users. The tokens will, however, only be available to those who’ve interacted with EigenLayer before April 29th. According to the update, the tokens will be reflected in allocations claimed after May 10th. The team will conduct an operation to filter out possible Sybil accounts, before rewarding Season 1 users with 10 EIGEN tokens (floor) and a (boost) of 100 EIGEN tokens. Eigen has made adjustments to meet community demands, highlighting that the foundation had already made plans to push for broader distribution. Eigen’s response, by allocating more EIGEN tokens for the stakedrop aligns with their mission, claiming that all they had to do was to accelerate the plan into Season 1 to accommodate community needs. Eigen Foundation’s Additional Clarifications The Eigen Foundation also had to make important clarifications on the processes mentioned when announcing the Stakedrop. The three major areas of clarification include Timeline, Lockup countdown, and Testnet user allocations. TimelinePrevious announcements indicated that EIGEN will be unlockable after new features go live. However, the Eigen Foundation did not specify when the new features could possibly go live to enable EIGEN transferability. They have now picked a date and it’s September 30th, 2024.Lockup CountdownThe community has also requested detailed information concerning the fund’s lockup and how EigenLayer will handle it. As earlier communicated, the funds on the protocol will be locked up for a while. Eigen Foundation clarifies that both Investors and team funds will remain locked up for one year after EIGEN becomes transferable. Giving users transfer powers way earlier than the team. The team will unlock at 4% per month, a year after and will be fully unlocked in three years. Testnet UsersThe developer community also received complaints from testnet users, claiming they were incorrectly removed from the eligibility list. Eigen Foundation has since clarified that the updates will be made and formal communication on the issue will be provided in due course.

Crypto exchanges to meet Nigerian SEC chief for regulatory talks

The Blockchain Industry Coordinating Committee of Nigeria (BICCoN) is convening a roundtable on May 6 between the new Director General of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and local and international crypto exchanges in Nigeria to discuss and seek consensus on the country’s crypto status.The BICCoN chair, Lucky Uwakwe, explained on a call with Cointelegraph that the meeting is open to all digital assets exchange operators, wallet providers, other virtual asset service providers (VASPs), and relevant industry associations and bodies to address pertinent issues and chart a progressive course for crypto regulations in Nigeria.Uwakwe explained that the virtual meeting is being convened at the invitation of Dr. Emomotimi Agama, the new DG of SEC Nigeria. Agama aims to engage with key stakeholders in the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem to address regulatory challenges and opportunities through collaborative dialogue. Agama, who was recently appointed to head the regulatory body, is known for his wealth of experience in blockchain and the capital market.According to Uwakwe, the meeting will allow different industry associations to present their perspectives on the current state of crypto in Nigeria. Some of these associations include Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG), Cryptographic Development Initiative in Nigeria (CDIN), Digital Currency Consortium (DCC) and Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SiBAN)Uwakwe expressed hope that the meeting could spark the right kind of change that would favor all crypto stakeholders in Nigeria and on the international scene. Uwakwe said:“Everyone’s presence and insights are invaluable as we collectively navigate the regulatory terrain and strive toward fostering an environment conducive to innovation and growth within the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector.”Nigeria has taken steps contradicting its December 2023 stance of lifting the crypto ban and has since launched probes into the use of cryptocurrency in the country. Related: Nigerian fintechs crack down on crypto, users face account blocksIn February, the Nigerian government used the country’s telecommunication providers to prevent local crypto users from accessing the websites of various crypto exchanges, such as Binance, OctaFX and others.Nigeria’s SEC also proposed an amendment to the rules guiding platforms offering crypto services, suggesting a hike in the registration fee for crypto exchanges from 30 million naira — the nation’s fiat currency — ($18,620) to 150 million naira ($93,000).Although the SEC attributes the proposed changes to input from industry stakeholders, some have criticized the 500 million naira ($310,343) paid-up capital requirement. They argue that this high fee would primarily favor foreign firms and disadvantage local entities.Magazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime

Pantera Capital invests in TON, eyes support for crypto adoption via Telegram - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Pantera Capital has announced it invested an undisclosed amount in TON.
The venture capital firm says TON’s integration with messaging platform Telegram could be a game-changer in crypto adoption.

Venture capital firm Pantera Capital has invested in The Open Network (TON) blockchain, the layer-1 network powered by Toncoin (TON).
TON was originally launched by messaging app giant Telegram and currently run by the open-source community.
In details shared in an announcement on Thursday, Pantera Capital said its investment aims at bolstering future growth for TON amid the push to bring more people to crypto via Telegram. 
Telegram integration boosts TON’s potential
The VC platform’s confidence in TON’s future and capacity to drive crypto adoption is down to the extensive use of crypto in the Telegram network.
“By leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and seamless UX with the vibrancy of TON’s emerging ecosystem, we believe TON has the potential to become one of the largest crypto networks,” Pantera wrote in the blog post.
While Pantera did not disclose the amount involved in the investment, it says Telegram, which has more than 900 million monthly active users, is the only major messaging app that is well poised to integrate Web3. 
As an illustration, the company cites Telegram’s monthly downloads of over 36.7 million in January this year as being ten times higher that of rival Signal.
“We believe Telegram is well positioned to bring crypto to the world because of its shared Web3 ethos and large distribution,” the company noted.
This outlook is strengthened by TON’s architecture, which features multiple components – TON Blockchain, TON Storage, TON DNS and TON Services. TON Blockchain serves as the backbone of this ecosystem, providing for a network with high transaction throughput, scalability and utility for millions of users.
Toncoin (TON) surges 
Pantera is investing in TON at a time the crypto platform is garnering massive interest from across the ecosystem.
Telegram has driven some of the biggest developments for TON, particularly its endorsement of the project. The decision to incorporate Toncoin (TON) token in a revenue-sharing program for channel owners. Telegram is also bringing tokenized emojis and stickers to its users via the TON blockchain.
Meanwhile, Tether’s integration and launch of native USDT on TON is another huge step for Telegram users.
TON price soared after the Pantera Capital news, with the altcoin jumping more than 12% to highs of $5.39 early Friday.

Dormant Ethereum holder moves $5.8M in ETH - More profit-taking now? - AMBCrypto



Stash was received during ETH’s ICO at 31 cents per token
Investor would lock a humongous 950719% in profits if they decide to sell

In what was a development that caught the eye of the broader cryptocurrency market, an Ethereum [ETH] holder woke up after nearly 9 years of dormancy to transfer their entire holdings to another wallet on Thursday.
Old ETH on the move
According to on-chain data tracking platform Lookonchain, an early investor who received 1,969 ETH during Ethereum’s initial coin offering (ICO) was seen moving 1,960 ETH. The transferred supply was worth $5.8 million at prevailing market prices. The participant received the ETH at 31 cents per token as part of the ICO.
The purpose of the transfer was yet to be ascertained, at the time of writing. However, there could be several explanations behind the move, with the most dominant narrative being realization of profits. At current prices, the investor would lock a humongous 950719% in profits.
Other factors could be diversifying their portfolios for other tokens.
Not the first time
Similar instances of reactivation of old ETH received during Genesis were seen earlier in the year. On 24 March, for instance, a participant moved the entirety of their 2,000 ETH received during the ICO. Before that, a wallet transferred 1,732 ETH to crypto-exchange Kraken on 2o February.
AMBCrypto investigated further using Santiment data and spotted sharp spikes in the movement of ETH that were inactive for more than five years. In nearly all the instances, the movement of dormant coins was followed by a price drop. This finding lends weight to the profit-taking theory discussed earlier.

ZKSNACKS Coinjoin Coordination Service Will Stop Functioning From June 1


							

ZKSNACKS has announced it is shutting down its Coinjoin coordination service from June 1, 2024.



The company cited regulatory uncertainty as the main reason for its decision.



Wasabi Wallet will continue functioning as a regular Bitcoin wallet.




ZKSNACKS, the company pioneering the development of the Wasabi wallet, has announced it is shutting down its Coinjoin coordination service from June 1, 2024. In a recent report, the company cited regulatory uncertainty as the main reason for discontinuing the privacy-focused service.







Posting on the Wasabi wallet blog, zkSNACKs highlighted that it decided to shut down the Coinjoin service following thoughtful considerations. However, the company noted that it will continue functioning as a regular Bitcoin wallet where users can generate private keys to receive and send Bitcoins.



Meanwhile, the firm highlighted Wasabi Wallet’s inherent privacy capabilities based on a filtering architecture on its client side, Tor integration, and custom coin selection functionalities. However, zkSNACKs highlighted the Bitcoin blockchain’s nature that prevents users from obtaining complete privacy without Coinjoins.



Furthermore, zkSNACKs noted that discontinuing its Coinjoin services would affect users of wallet clients that connect to the zkSNACKs coordinator, including Trezor Suite and BTCPayServer.









Wasabi Wallet is a pioneer privacy solution on the Bitcoin network that launched in 2018 as a free open-source software, and zkSNACKs noted it would maintain the protocol despite discontinuing Coinjoin. As an open-source solution, users can contribute, open new issues, submit pull requests, or even fork the Wasabi Wallet.



The decision to discontinue the Coinjoin privacy solution comes amid ongoing litigation between the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the foremost cryptocurrency privacy solution, Tornado Cash. In a recent twist of events, the DOJ filed an opposition to Tornado Cash’s co-founder’s motion asking the court to dismiss the money laundering, sanctions violations, and other charges labeled against him.

BNP Paribas buys shares of BlackRock's Bitcoin spot ETF

BNP Paribas, the second largest bank in Europe in terms of assets under management, has announced its investment in Bitcoin using BlackRock’s spot ETF tool.
The exposure of the credit institution on cryptocurrency has been revealed through form 13F, a quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that shows all the company’s managed activities.
Although the investment in IBIT may seem modest compared to the economic possibilities of the banking giant, its entry into the world of Bitcoin ETFs marks an important step towards achieving mainstream acceptance of this asset class.
Let’s see all the details below.

French bank BNP Paribas has purchased BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF: details from form 13F
According to the information from the 13F form filed on April 31, 2024 with the SEC, the bank BNP Paribas would have purchased shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) for $41,600.
Despite the figure being quite small, especially if we consider the second largest banking group in Europe with an AUM of 600 billion dollars, its entry sets an important precedent for other credit institutions that may intend to expose themselves to Bitcoin.
Going into more detail, based on what is reported in model 13F, which we remind you is mandatory for managers with institutional investments above 100 million dollars, BNP Paribas would have purchased 1,030 shares of IBIT in the first quarter of 2024 at $40.47 per share, for a total of $41,684.10, less than the value of a single Bitcoin at current prices.

Other banking giants and asset managers have entered the doors of the cryptographic market with Bitcoin spot ETFs. Among these are the best known Park Avenue Securities, Inscription Capital, Wedbush Private Capital and American National Bank.
Anyway BNP Paribas enjoys a much greater reputation being classified as one of the 6 most financially solid banks in the world by the rating agency Standard & Poor’s. 
The news of its exposure, although relatively small, could push the entire European banking sector to consider the possibility of a strategic investment aimed at increasing the performance of its portfolio.
In this regard, we report an analysis by Grayscale, which highlights how a 5% allocation to Bitcoin could maximize the returns (adjusted for risk) of a balanced portfolio, rather than focusing on bonds and stocks.
Since they were launched in January of this year, Bitcoin spot ETFs have already surpassed $200 billion in cumulative volume, marking an important milestone for the digital finance sector.
It seems that in addition to retail investors, institutional investors are also attracted to this instrument: we will see in the future which will be the next giants to join the ranks of bitcoiners.
Meanwhile, some insights from BlackRock suggest that investments in ETFs are set to expand, with potential imminent allocations from sovereign funds, pensions, and endowments.
Netflow trend of its Bitcoin ETF: 7 consecutive days in the red
While BNP Paribas begins to acquire IBIT shares of BlackRock, the net flows of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States mark negative values day after day, fueling the drop in the price of the cryptocurrency.
According to data from Farside Investors, from April 24th to May 2nd, each trading session on these products ended with more outflow than inflow.
Grayscale still dominates the stage in terms of sales, representing the largest ETF, with an AUM of 17.2 billion dollars.
Blackrock instead, which follows in second place the rival with an AUM of 16.4 billion dollars, has recorded an anomalous trend having marked 0 trades from April 24th to 30th, and a netflow of 36.9 million on May 1st, then returning to 0 the following day.
The situation at the moment seems to be in the hands of sellers, effectively influencing the price action of BTC pushing it towards 52,000 USD.
The short-term future of cryptocurrency, in addition to the internal scenarios of spot ETFs, is also and above all marked by the performance of the global economy at a macro level.
The next interventions of the FED will be crucial in determining the economic policies of the American central bank, and consequently the influence on risk-on assets such as Bitcoin.
Probably the hot season for investments will arrive in the middle of summer or around September/October, as soon as the first interest rate cut is made as a sign of tightening easing. 
Meanwhile, Bitcoin spot ETFs, regardless of the market direction, attract very significant trading volumes, totaling over $200 billion.
Since the beginning of the year, the netflow is positive for 11.1 billion dollars, despite the outflow of 17.5 billion from Grayscale.

Dutch Authority Seizes $12 Million in ZKasino Rug Pull Case


In a notable crackdown on crypto fraud, the Dutch anti-fraud agency FIOD has arrested a 26-year-old man. 
He is suspected of fraud, embezzlement, and money laundering concerning the ZKasino rug pull, marking a critical development in combating crypto-related scams.
Dutch Agency Investigates ZKasino Rug Pull 
FIOD initiated a rigorous investigation on April 25, spurred by alerts from X (formerly Twitter) and intelligence from their departments. The focus was a significant rug pull involving the gambling platform ZKasino, where over $32 million was invested by global victims. 

“Investors were led to believe that they would get their investments back within 30 days. That did not happen. The smart contract was set up in such a technical way that suggests that this return was not intended,” FIOD wrote.

During the operation, authorities searched a residence and seized various digital data carriers. Assets confiscated included over €11.4 million (~ $12.2 million) in real estate, a luxury car, and diverse cryptocurrencies. 
The agency presented the suspect before a magistrate. Consequently, they managed to extend the suspect’s detention by fourteen days to allow further investigation.
Moreover, FIOD worked closely with Binance’s Financial Crime Compliance and Investigations Team to secure millions in cryptocurrencies. This collaboration highlights the growing synergy between law enforcement and cryptocurrency platforms in addressing financial crimes.
Additionally, FIOD believes there are probabilities for more arrests, as investigation evolves.

The allegations against ZKasino have drawn severe criticism from industry experts, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He criticized the platform for its fraudulent misuse of zero-knowledge proofs, stressing that emerging technologies are increasingly becoming buzzwords exploited by scammers. 

“There is nothing “ZK” about ZKasino except that it lives on zksync, correct? I guess we have to adapt; even “ZK” is now a mainstream enough buzzword that full-on scammers are adopting it,” Buterin remarked.

Additionally, ZKasino faced serious accusations from ZigZag Exchange last month, which charged its developers with diverting development funds for personal use. Although these claims initially attracted little attention, the escalating complaints from the crypto community brought the issues to prominence. 
ZigZag also alleged that ZKasino made false claims about its funding and failed to compensate many developers and contractors.

In response to the unfolding controversy, significant players in the cryptocurrency market took decisive action. Notably, the MEXC exchange canceled its planned token listing for ZKasino to protect its users’ rights, while Ape Terminal canceled its Initial DEX Offering linked to ZKasino, assuring refunds to all participants.

Dogecoin Mirroring Price Action That Preceded Massive Bull Runs in the Past, Says Trader - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Ali Martinez is saying that the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) is exhibiting behavior it has previously displayed before embarking on massive rallies.
Martinez tells his 61,200 followers on the social media platform X that the largest memecoin by market cap earlier this year broke out of a descending triangle, which is considered bullish if the price breaks out above the upper trend line, on the weekly chart.










“It is currently undergoing a 47% price correction, very similar to previous cycles, which could ignite the next DOGE bull run!”

According to Martinez, Dogecoin exhibited similar price behavior in 2017 and 2021.
“In 2017, DOGE broke out of a descending triangle. Then, DOGE retraced by 40% before entering a 982% bull run!”

“In 2021, DOGE broke out of a descending triangle again. Then, DOGE retraced by 56% before skyrocketing by 12,197%!”

“Over the years, Dogecoin appears to mirror its previous bull cycles! All you need is a little bit of patience.”

Dogecoin is trading at $0.13 at time of writing.
Next up is the second-largest memecoin by market cap, Shiba Inu (SHIB). Martinez says that he entered a long position nearly 20% below the current level and is targeting a gain of close to 4x.
“Shiba Inu appears to be forming a bull flag on the daily chart! I’m placing buy orders around $0.000018343, aiming for a bullish breakout that sends SHIB to $0.000072323.”

SHIB is trading at $0.0000225 at time of writing.

All Bitcoin ETFs Are Dropping Their Holdings

Recently, nine Bitcoin ETFs significantly reduced their holdings by a total of 8,107 BTC, worth approximately $478.22 million. This reduction included notable entities such as BlackRock, which reduced its holdings by 638 BTC (about $37.62 million). Similarly, Fidelity and Grayscale reduced their holdings by 3,323 BTC (around $196 million) and 1,588 BTC (approximately $93.66 million), respectively.This substantial decrease in Bitcoin holdings by ETFs coincides with the cryptocurrency's price drop below the $60,000 mark, a critical support level that had previously been considered a strong threshold that held the market together. This price decline has led to significant outflows, indicating a shift in investor sentiment toward caution due to increased market volatility and potential risk aversion.BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewFrom the recent chart analysis, Bitcoin shows that it struggled to maintain levels above $60,000 and faced resistance near $61,018. Following the drop, the price found temporary footing around $52,107, suggesting a possible new lower boundary of support. Currently, Bitcoin is trading slightly above $59,375, trying to recover from recent falls but still below the critical resistance level.For Bitcoin's price to exhibit growth and regain confidence among investors, it would need to consistently hold above the $52,107 (200 EMA) support level and ideally break through the resistance at $61,018. This movement would likely require positive sentiment across the market, possibly driven by rising demand for risky assets.Looking ahead, the key for Bitcoin will be its ability to stabilize and attract investors back to a bullish stance. If it successfully maintains above the mentioned support and breaks past the resistance, it could signal a turnaround to a bullish market. However, failure to do so might see the price testing even lower support levels, possibly around $50,000.

First Option Data of May Announced! Has the Expected Rise Signal Arrived for Bitcoin and Etherem? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Bitcoin fell below $60,000 in the declines that started in April. While the BTC price dropped to $56,000, it later recovered and approached $60,000.
Now, while a rise is expected in BTC and altcoins, eyes are turned to Bitcoin and Ethereum options that will expire today.


According to the news of Singapore-based crypto options data platform Greeks.live, 23,000 BTC and 330,000 ETH options will expire on May 3.
Accordingly, while the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.49, the maximum loss point is $61,000 and the notional value is $1.4 billion.





Looking at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.36, a maximum loss point of $3,000, and a notional value of $1 billion.
Stating that Bitcoin continued to fall after its ATH in March, Greeks.live said that the failure of Hong Kong ETFs to meet expectations and the continuation of outflows in spot ETFs in the USA were effective in this decline.



“The crypto market continued to decline this week, with BTC falling to a new low since March.
This decline was due to the failure of Hong Kong ETFs to achieve the expected volume increase and the continuation of outflows in US BTC ETFs. These led to a weakening of market confidence.
However, sustained horizontal movements are unlikely to last long. And without the necessary catalysts for recovery, a downward slide is inevitable.”

What Does the Put/Call Ratio Indicate for Bitcoin and Ethereum?
The put/call ratio is calculated by dividing the number of put options by the number of call options. A ratio below 1 means there are more purchases than puts, indicating an upward trend.
A ratio above 1 means there are more put options than call options, indicating a bearish trend. A ratio close to 1 means the market is balanced or neutral.





For Bitcoin, this rate is 0.49; For Ethereum it appears as 0.36. Accordingly, although these rates indicate an upward trend for BTC and ETH, they alone will not be sufficient data for an increase or decrease.
Time will tell how these rates, along with other data and signals, will affect prices. At this point, do not make your investment decisions based on a single data or report.

Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) Forming Dead Cat Bounce? Questionable Reversal




Cover image via www.freepik.com

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies.

Shiba Inu is currently exhibiting signs of a weak reversal, also known as a dead cat bounce. Unfortunately, as things unfold, there is a good possibility of Shiba Inu simply losing steam and reversing downwards. One way or another, the market's state, in general, will be a decisive factor here. In recent trading sessions, SHIB has shown some upward momentum from its lows, but this trend lacks the strength we saw in previous strong rallies. The volume accompanying these price changes has been notably low, indicating a lack of substantial buying interest. This scenario is often a red flag suggesting that the asset does not have enough backing at this point in time. SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewExamining the chart, SHIB is trading near the $0.00002264 mark, struggling to break past the immediate resistance level at $0.00002384. This resistance level is crucial as it previously acted as both support and resistance, making it a significant price point for the asset. If SHIB manages to sustain a breakout above this level, it might target the next resistance near $0.00002447.However, the potential for a further decline cannot be ignored. SHIB is showing signs that the lows around $0.00002175 might not hold if selling pressure increases. Such a breakdown could see SHIB testing even lower supports, potentially around $0.00002000, a level crucial for the Shbia Inu's foreseeable future. The broader sentiment around Shiba Inu mirrors the general risk currently prevalent on the market. Investors are cautious, steering away from assets considered risky, especially meme coins like SHIB. The overall market demand for such assets is close to nonexistent.

Bitcoin miner CleanSpark records highest single mining day in April in post-halving report

CleanSpark has released its first monthly unaudited Bitcoin mining and operations update since the halving. The company exceeded 17 EH/s in hashrate, mining an impressive 721 BTC with a record daily high of over 48 BTC.CEO Zach Bradford highlighted the company’s monthly gains in efficiency metrics as they deploy advanced S21 machines across their expanding facilities. These improvements have amplified mining output and optimized operational costs. He commented,“The remarkable increase in transaction fees immediately following the halving has significantly bolstered our bitcoin production this month, resulting in a robust increase to our bitcoin treasury.”Bradford emphasized CleanSpark’s industry-leading scale and low mining costs, positioning them to excel in the new post-halving environment. The company has already observed signs of less efficient miners ceasing operations, which is expected to contribute to a decline in the global hash rate and a temporary yet beneficial correction in Bitcoin’s spot price over the coming weeks.In April 2024, CleanSpark mined 721 BTC, bringing their year-to-date total to 2,752 BTC. As of April 30, the company held 5,739 BTC in its treasury. CleanSpark sold 2.88 bitcoin in April at an average price of approximately $64,000 per Bitcoin. Their deployed fleet consisted of 136,496 miners with a month-end fleet efficiency of 24.22 J/TH and a current hashrate of 17.3 EH/s.The company is making progress on expanding its Dalton, GA, campus. Once complete, the expansion, referred to as Dalton 4, will run a fleet of S21s in a 15MW facility, adding approximately 0.8 EH/s. This will bring CleanSpark’s total hashrate at the Dalton campus, consisting of four independent data centers, to 2.4 EH/s.CleanSpark’s strong performance in April demonstrates its ability to thrive in the competitive post-halving Bitcoin mining landscape. With its focus on efficiency, expanding operations, and strategic planning, the company believes it is well-positioned for continued success in the months and years ahead.Mentioned in this article

Solana vs Polygon and TRON - What DEX volumes and TVLs tell us - AMBCrypto



Solana outperformed Polygon and Tron in terms of transaction volume
DEX volumes and TVL surged, while overall interest in Solana NFTs waned

Recently activity and interest on the Solana [SOL] network dipped. Despite the slowdown in activity, however, it still managed to outperform networks such as Polygon and Tron.
In fact, Artemis’s data revealed that Solana continued to dominate in terms of transfer volume and came second only to Ethereum on this front.
Source: Artemis
DEX volumes on the rise
However, it wasn’t just overall activity where Solana prospered, with recent data indicating that Solana did well in terms of DEX (Decentralized Exchange) volumes too. Over the last few days alone, Solana’s DEX volumes grew from $691 million to $1.2 billion. This surge in DEX volumes highlighted the popularity of Solana’s DEXs, indicative of a budding ecosystem.
The activity on the DEXs on Solana can be largely attributed to the popularity of memecoins on the Solana network. The low fees required to build tokens on the Solana network caused a surge in the creation and trading of memecoins, leading to the DEX volumes growing.
Source: Artemis
Owing to these factors, Solana did relatively well in terms of TVL (Total Value Locked) as well. In fact, Solana managed to have an average TVL of $3.7 billion over the last few days.
Here, it’s worth noting that even though Solana’s TVL was consistent, protocols such as Tron continued to outperform Solana on this front.
Source: Artemis
Despite Solana’s consistent activity and TVL, however, the revenue generated on the network continued to decline.
In fact, over the past week, the revenue generated by Solana fell from $1.1 million to $381,000. Tron took the lead in this department as well and continued to generate high amounts of revenue.
Even though the overall metrics of the Solana ecosystem have been showing signs of a healthy network, areas such as TVL and revenue would need to improve for long-term sustainability.

Read Solana’s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-25

NFT interest falls
Another area where Solana would need to see improvement would be in the NFT sector. Over the last few weeks, interest in blue chip NFT collections has plummeted.
Coupled with that, the total floor value of the average Solana NFT collection and NFT sales volumes have also declined.

FTX Ex-Executive Ryan Salame surrenders $5.9M estate in Bahamas

Ryan Salame, the former co-head at FTX Digital Markets, has agreed to surrender a million-dollar estate in the Bahamas. This decision is a concession he made as part of the plea bargain with American authorities. An object in question we are holding, valued at $5.9 million, is situated in the Marina Residences at Albany Building 10 Condominium, Unit 3A in particular. Alipay Salame’s agreement for the transfer is meant to be an important part of restitution for $5.6 million for FTX Trading Ltd and related creditors.The process of asset transfer was stated in the motion filed on May 1, 2023, with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The filings stated that instead of selling the property, the debtors prefer to pursue a deed in lieu of foreclosure in order to sidestep the possible losses from a quick sale. This strategy aims to keep the value of their other Bahamian real estate properties and then monetize them in the future.Salame made a strategic choice to utilize the land to pay the restitution that was accepted to avoid the financial hardships of a cash payment. The agreement is viewed as satisfactory for both parties, Salame and the debtors, enabling the former to pay the full penalty and avoid asset forfeiture.FTX bankruptcy unravels complex property dealsIn September 2021, Salame purchased the property from the Alameda Research account at Silvergate Bank, where he sent a 10% deposit ($7.2 million). Consequently, the next installments for the same property were paid to Salame through the FTX DM correspondent account in the total sum of $8.1 million, transferred from the Fidelity Bank account in the Bahamas. Such funds were meant to be attached to the balance of the purchase payment.On March 31, 2022, Salame and Alameda Research signed a promissory note to confirm the terms of payment between Salame and Alameda. According to the note, Salame would pay Alameda $8.1 million back. Besides that development, the company was compelled to disclose its financial arrangement due to the broader unraveling of FTX and Alameda, which led to bankruptcy filings in November 2022. Real estate transactions are also among the things that have been unwound in the current bankruptcy flow of files.The transfer of the property to finalize the restitution is indispensable to settle the rift through which the funds of previous FTX Digital Markets tenures were lost. This is a measure towards wider initiatives to deal with the negative impact following the company’s demise.Ryan Salame pleads guilty, awaits sentencingRyan Salame was charged with conspiracy to make illegal political contributions, defraud the Federal Election Commission, and run an unregistered money transmission company. His guilty plea last September resulted in the present restitution agreement. Salame will be sentenced on May 28, 2024, though the criminal proceedings may not end on the same date.The case has raised the question of regulation and law in the cryptocurrency industry. Alongside FTX, ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who was accused of the crime, was also given 25 years in prison in March last year. The resolution of Salame’s case, comprising the transfer of property, is being continuously reviewed to understand the circumvention of comprehensive financial crimes involving cryptocurrency organizations. The implications may also possibly set a precedent for future regulatory mechanisms that cater to cryptocurrency markets and prevent the recurrence of similar situations.

Australia Clarifies Crypto Use in Non-Cash Payment Facilities - DailyCoin


        
Australia has set a precedent for crypto in non-cash payments.



The precedent emanated from a ruling in ASIC’s case against BPS.



The case is still ongoing.
Justice Downes of Australia’s Federal Court has set a judicial precedent clarifying the legality of non-cash payment facilities involving cryptocurrency assets.On May 3, the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) announced its first court win against BPS Financial Pty (BPS), a company the regulator accused of advertising Qoin tokens as a mode of payment via Qoin Wallet for goods and services offered by Qoin Merchants.In delivering judgment, the court highlighted the legal shortcomings of BPS’s crypto-based, non-cash payment product.When Crypto Is Illegal in Non-Cash PaymentsAccording to the announcement, Justice Downes found that BPS’s offering contravened Australia’s Corporations Act as the company did not hold an Australian Financial Services License, “nor was authorized by a licensed holder to provide financial advice about the Qoin Wallet.”
Pointing out deceptive promotion, the court noted that BPS misrepresented that the Qoin wallet was officially registered when it was not and that it could be used to acquire goods and services from an “increasing number of Qoin merchants,” when in fact “it was declining.”The court further established that BPS misled its customers that they could exchange Qoin tokens for fiat or other cryptocurrencies through independent exchanges.
“The Court found the only digital currency exchange that accepted Qoin prior to November 2021 was BTX Exchange, which was not independent of BPS and did not permit crypto assets to be exchanged with each other,” ASIC stated.Per ASIC Chair Joe Longo, the ruling has set a significant precedent in Australia’s crypto industry by clarifying what a regulated product constituted and when the underlying provider needed a license.Following the first outcome, the court directed ASIC and BPS to “confer with respect to directions” that may be made for further hearings.Read about Australia’s plans for a Bitcoin ETF:Australia Mulls Bitcoin ETF to Bolster Crypto Hub AmbitionsStay updated on BTCC’s massive crypto trading contest:BTCC Sets 10M USDT Rewards for Its World Trading Contest

                        The Jupiter price has risen by 8% in the past 24 hours, with its move to $1.01 coming as the wider crypto market gains by a more modest 2.5% today.This means that JUP is basically flat in a week, but down by 3% in a fortnight and by 40% in a month.The DeFi utility token is also down by 49% since reaching an all-time high of $2 on January 31 of this year.However, this slippage arguably means that the coin is ready to rebound in a big way, with today’s jump potentially the beginning of a significant rally.Jupiter Price Prediction as JUP Gains 8% Overnight — Is It Time to Load Up?
What’s interesting about JUP’s chart is that the coin had been in a weak position in recent days and weeks, but its indicators now suggest that it’s making a return.This is particularly noticeable with the coin’s 30-day average (orange), which is on the brink of overtaking its 200-day (blue), a move which typically indicates a breakout.Source: TradingViewAt the same time, JUP’s relative strength index (purple) has finally risen above 60 today.While it has dipped in the past few hours it’s likely to rebound soon, given that it had already spent so long below 50 over the past week.It’s also encouraging that the coin’s trading volume has risen from $70 million a few days ago to $140 million today.This indicates rising interest in the token, and because volumes had been low for several weeks, it’s possible that today is the beginning of a sustained increase.One of the fundamental reasons for JUP’s gains over the past couple of days is that Jupiter recently announced the launch of a new liquid staking token, JupSOL.The high yields offered by this token have driven investors to Jupiter, with the latest data now showing that the latter is the biggest DEX in the market in terms of unique active wallets.Such growth is likely to push the Jupiter price higher in the medium- and long-term, especially as and when rate cuts arrive and help the wider market rally.JUP could possibly hit $1.30 by the end of the summer, before returning to its ATH by the end of 2024.Diversification into Low-Cap Alts for Big Gains
While JUP is an exciting prospect right now, it isn’t the only alt in the market with strong potential for big gains in the near and more distant future.We’re also seeing a wide variety of presale tokens that have been raising large sums on the basis of having solid fundamentals and communities.And one of the hottest at the moment is Sealana (SEAL), a Solana-based meme coin which launched its token offering only this week.It has already raised just over $140,000, with this total only likely to accelerate as word spreads about the project.Source: sealana.ioSealana has chosen the seal as its meme, albeit an anthropomorphic seal that likes to trade crypto and make enough money to not have to work.It already seems that its stylings are attracting investors, with SEAL on course to become the latest Solana meme token to outperform much of the market.While additional details about the project will emerge in due course, traders can already join its presale by going to the official Sealana website.There, they can send SOL to the following address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.They can currently buy Sealana at an exchange rate of 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which converts to around $0.02 at today’s prices. Given what we’ve seen from other Solana-based meme tokens this year (e.g. WIF), SEAL could surge well beyond this price once it lists in the next few weeks.Buyers will receive their tokens via an airdrop, once the sale ends, at which point they will be able to sell (or hold) and make some potentially large profits.Buy SEAL Today

Nigerian BICCoN calls for crypto exchanges round table with SEC chief amid crackdown - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Recently, crypto exchanges like Binance have found themselves under serious scrutiny in Nigeria
The BICCoN-led initiative for a meeting between the SEC chief and crypto exchanges reflects a commitment to fostering a conducive crypto environment.
The outcome of the discussions holds the potential to shape the future trajectory of crypto regulation in Nigeria.

Nigeria’s cryptocurrency landscape is witnessing a flurry of activity as regulatory discussions heat up. Amidst crackdowns by the Nigerian Central Bank (CBN) on crypto transactions, the Blockchain Industry Coordinating Committee of Nigeria (BICCoN) has called for a pivotal meeting between the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) chief and local and international crypto exchanges.
Regulatory dialogue fuels hope for crypto exchanges
Despite efforts to promote regulatory clarity, Nigeria’s crypto space faces contradictions and challenges amid recent actions by the Nigerian Central Bank including crackdowns on crypto transactions and probes into cryptocurrency usage. Moreover, telecommunications providers have been compelled to block local crypto users from accessing various crypto exchanges’ websites.
Also, in 2022, the SEC introduced new crypto rules, including a substantial hike in registration fees for crypto exchanges, sparking criticism, particularly due to the potential disadvantage to local entities.
The meeting, slated for May 6, aims to address the regulatory challenges and seek consensus on the country’s crypto status. It signals a potential turning point in Nigeria’s crypto regulatory landscape after a period of intense crackdown on cryptocurrency activities in the country.
Dr. Emomotimi Agama, the newly appointed SEC Director General, has extended invitations to industry players, including Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG), Cryptographic Development Initiative in Nigeria (CDIN), Digital Currency Consortium (DCC), and Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SiBAN).
If fruitful the meeting will foster collaborative efforts in navigating regulatory challenges and unlocking opportunities for growth within Nigeria’s crypto ecosystem.
With diverse perspectives being brought to the table, there is optimism that the meeting could spark positive changes benefiting all crypto stakeholders in Nigeria and on the international stage.

                        The Bonk ($BONK) meme coin is one of today’s biggest rallies, with the BONK price skyrocketing 13.4% in 24 hours.The Solamna meme coin currently trades for $0.00002611. Its overnight gains are the highest of any top 100 currency, except Arweave (AR) which blew up 19.5% to trade at $34.98.That also makes it the fastest appreciating meme coin among the seven largest by market capitalization. Sector leader Dogecoin ($DOGE) only added 3.4% overnight and trades at $0.1327 at the start of the weekend. BONK’s trading chart shows an asset that rose in step with the rest of the market during the early March rally.

The token’s price is currently valued higher than its 30-day moving average, as seen in the respective green and blue lines. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 67 and climbing, investors appear to be pumping the token, however this momentum is likely to die down quickly.Bonk Bounces Back Faster Than Bitcoin
Market leaders Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH) had more muted recoveries. The world’s favorite cryptocurrency added 2.5% to trade at $59,305 on Friday morning, UTC. Its number one contender added 1.3% and sells at $2,976 as of this writing. Markets were rocked on Tuesday by news that Binance’s founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao received a four-month prison sentence for charges related to money laundering.

Jack Dorsey's Company, Block, Announced Which Cryptocurrency It Will Buy With Its Profits! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Jack Dorsey's company Block, formerly known as Square, saw its shares rise in after-hours trading Thursday after a first-quarter earnings report that beat analysts' expectations.
Block's Bitcoin Investment Strategy Boosts Shares
The company reported adjusted earnings of 85 cents per share, beating the consensus estimate by 13 cents and generating revenue of $5.97 billion, topping Wall Street's projection of $5.82 billion. Gross profit in this quarter increased by 22% compared to the previous year, reaching $2.09 billion.


In a notable move, the Jack Dorsey-led company announced plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings and open source its treasury blueprint to encourage others to do the same.

Block will invest 10% of the gross profit it makes from Bitcoin products into Bitcoin purchases each month. The company's original Bitcoin investment of $220 million has already increased by nearly 160% to $573 million.


“We believe the world needs an open monetary protocol that is not owned or controlled by any single entity,” Dorsey said.





“We believe Bitcoin is the best and only candidate to be this protocol and ultimately the native currency of the internet.”
The company's Cash App unit recorded a 25% increase in gross profit in the first quarter compared to the same period a year ago.


This growth was primarily driven by strong performance in Cash App Card, BNPL platform, Bitcoin products and Cash App Borrow, as well as inflows and monetization rate per asset.
While the total amount of Bitcoin sales sold to customers and recorded as Bitcoin revenue was $2.73 billion, a gross profit of $80 million was achieved in the first quarter.

Dutch police arrest suspect in $30 million ZKasino scam - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Dutch police arrested a 26-year-old man on April 29.
The arrest is connected to the ZKasino crypto gambling scam that involves over $30 million.
Police have seized 11.4 million euros ($12.2 million) in crypto and other assets from the suspect.

Dutch police have arrested a 26-year-old man amid a law enforcement investigation around ZKasino. The crypto project is allegedly a crypto gambling scam involving more than $30 million.
ZKasino scam suspect arrested
According to the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD), authorities detained the individual on April 29, on suspicion of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering. The arrest comes after an outcry from the public in the wake of suspicious activities around the ZKasino platform.
Dutch authorities have seized more than 11.4 million euros ($12.2 million) in crypto assets, real estate and a luxury car from the suspect, FIOD announced on May 3.
Scrutiny on ZKasino increased in mid-April after multiple crypto exchanges and platforms, including Ape Terminal, halted listing of the project’s token amid scam allegations.
FIOD says a criminal investigation into ZKasino launched on April 25. 
The probe into the crypto gambling platform revolves around a potential rug pull, with over $30 million invested by people from across the world. Investors were led to believe they would receive returns on their money within 30 days.
Zkasino raised 10,515 ETH from investors in March. Ahead of its launch, ZKasino attracted over 10,000 participants to its $ZKAS token bridge. 
However, red flags hit when the team moved all of the ETH to a Lido staking account and changed wording content on its website. Despite widespread condemnation, with security analysts pointing to a potential rug pull, the ZKasino team called these FUD and alleged the project’s launch would go live.
According to FIOD, the suspect will be detained for fourteen days to allow for further investigations.

Bitcoin and Ether options worth $2.4B set to expire May 3, max BTC pain at $61K

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) options contracts worth a combined $2.4 billion are set to expire on May 3, which could lead to increased market volatility.A Bitcoin options contract is a derivative contract that allows investors to speculate on Bitcoin price movements without owning Bitcoin itself. There are two types: call and put options. Call options give investors the right to buy a cryptocurrency at a specific price before a certain date. Put options, on the other hand, allow investors to sell a cryptocurrency at a particular price before the expiry date.Investors often use the put/call ratio as a metric to assess the general state of the market. If traders are purchasing more puts than calls, it is considered a bearish sign, and if they are purchasing more calls than puts, then the market sentiment is considered bullish. A put-to-call ratio below 0.7 is considered bullish, while a ratio of more than 1 is regarded as a bearish indicator.Related: US lawmakers urge SEC to approve Bitcoin options tradingOn May 3, a total of 23,367 Bitcoin contracts worth $1.39 billion are set to expire. Data from the Deribit exchange reveal that the put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options contracts is currently at 0.5, with a maximum pain point of $61,000. The maximum pain point refers to the price at which the asset will cause financial losses to the greatest number of holders.Bitcoin options expiry.

Source: DeribitThe expiry of options contracts has historically been followed by short-term price volatility in the spot crypto market. Bitcoin and Ether have experienced bearish pressure in the past couple of weeks. The BTC price fell below $60,000, marking an almost 20% weekly correction post-halving. The Ether price also fell below $2,900.

DOJ Crackdown on Privacy App Sparks Debate on Digital Financial Privacy


							

DOJ crackdown on Wasabi Wallet’s coinjoin service raises digital privacy concerns.



Whistleblower Edward Snowden criticises slow progress on Bitcoin privacy by Developers.



Privacy advocates urge developers to find solutions for anonymous transactions.




DOJ’s Crackdown on Privacy App Wasabi Wallet Raises Concerns About Financial Privacy in Digital Age. Privacy-focused Wasabi wallet has shut down its Coinjoin Coordination service. Naomi Brockwell, a cryptocurrency and privacy advocate criticized the DOJ’s action on Twitter, stressing the importance of financial privacy for a free society.







zkSNACKs, the company behind the development of Wasabi Wallet tweeted that it is is discontinuing its conjoin coordination service effective June 1st, 2024, after years of dedicated work to enhance Bitcoin’s privacy. 



Privacy Advocate Edward Snowden who has always been a famous figure in the world of cryptocurrencies and privacy joined the conversation. Snowden used the Wasabi wallet discontinuation tweet as a reference to indicate Bitcoin Developers that the clock on Privacy is ticking as the DOJ is criminalising Privacy-focused developments in the industry.









Going back in the 2020 conversation, Snowden and Brockwell discussed the need for privacy in Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Snowden, a champion for privacy and freedoms, questioned the slow progress on issues like scaling and privacy within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. He pointed out the weaknesses in existing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, regarding privacy protections.



Brockwell’s tweet aligns with Snowden’s concerns, as the DOJ’s crackdown highlights the ongoing struggle to ensure financial privacy in the digital age. Snowden argues that developers have had ample time to address these issues but haven’t provided viable solutions, reflecting a broader sentiment within the cryptocurrency community.

Crypto Exchange Coinbase (COIN) Had a Blowout First Quarter: Analysts

“While we believe investors must remain level-headed around the ebbs and flows of enthusiasm into the industry, which often coincide with fluctuations in price, we see a number of underlying trends supporting our positive thesis that Coinbase will be a relevant player in virtually all aspects of the crypto economy,” JMP analysts led by Devin Ryan wrote.

Bitcoin Spot ETFs In Hong Kong Gains Attention: Bloomberg Analyst Weighs In | Bitcoinist.com


								Following a successful first-day trade of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in Hong Kong, popular Bloomberg Intelligence expert Eric Balchunas has taken center stage to analyze the historical introduction of the products in the country.
Hong Kong’s Bitcoin Spot ETFs Attract Notable Inflows
On Tuesday, Eric Balchunas called Hong Kong Spot Bitcoin ETFs a market for ants, as it is just 1/168th the size of the funds in the United States. He further highlighted that the debut of HK spot ETFs coincided well with the US slowdown, so their inflows will more than offset the marginally negative US flows.

Given the notable inflows seen on the first day, the Human and Machine channel called out the analyst noting that after raising more than HK$11.2 million on their first day of operation, Hong Kong’s Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs countered net outflows from the US market.
Responding to the channel’s post, Balchunas stated that he and his team recently released a memo including the final data regarding HK’s spot ETFs, which is not as timely as in the US. According to the expert, he previously projected the products would garner a $1 billion inflow in two years. However, with Hong Kong witnessing $292 million in assets on day 1, he believes his predictions might be way ahead of schedule and corrections can derail plans, as seen in the US market.
During the first day of trading, Ethereum spot ETFs took up 15% of the market, and investors seemed to be drawn to larger funds rather than lower fees. The ChinaAMC BTC spot ETF (3042 HK) with higher fees saw the highest inflow valued at $124 million on the first day. Meanwhile, other funds with lesser fees like the Harvest Bitcoin Spot ETF (3439 HK) and Bosera Hashkey Bitcoin ETF (3008 HK) saw a net inflow of $63 million and $61 million respectively on day one.
Eric Balchunas’s emphasis seemed to have fueled confusion among community members, as a pseudonymous X user questioned the analyst on the difference between the $292 million in assets and the HK$11.2 million of inflows. 
Balchunas responded saying that the exact $292 million in assets that were contributed as seed money just prior to launch are not included in the volume calculation. Meanwhile, in the US, seed money is withheld until the first day to make the volume appear larger, which aids in marketing.
The Funds Sees Massive Outflows In US
The Bloomberg expert’s review came in light of the massive outflows witnessed in the US market surpassing $500 million in a day. Wednesday saw the fastest-ever selloff of US BTC spot ETFs by investors, recording a cumulative net outflow of $563.7 million.

According to data from Farside Investors, this marks the biggest outflow since the funds started trading early this year. Of the 10 Spot Bitcoin ETFs, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw the largest withdrawals, totaling $191.1 million.
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) had withdrawals of about $167.4 million, while Blackrock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a whopping $36.9 million withdrawn, marking its first day of outflows since its inception.

3 May: 5 Solana Memecoins That Could Skyrocket 9,000% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

                        Coinbase has reported a remarkable revenue of $1.6 billion in the first quarter of the year, representing a substantial 72% increase compared to the previous quarter. The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States also disclosed a net income of $1.18 billion ($4.40 per share). The impressive performance was driven by a surge in transactions resulting from the overall uptrend in the cryptocurrency market and a favorable change in accounting rules related to cryptocurrencies.Coinbase Transaction Revenue Doubles
Consumer transaction revenue experienced a doubling effect, reaching $935.2 million, with volume soaring by over 93% to $56 billion. Institutional trading witnessed even more significant growth, with revenue surging by 133% to $85.4 million compared to the previous quarter, while volume more than doubled to $256 billion. Bitcoin played a prominent role in both consumer and institutional transactions, accounting for one-third of the activity.These figures, which surpassed analysts’ predictions of $1.34 billion in revenue and net income of $1.09 per share, greatly exceeded expectations. Following the announcement, Coinbase’s shares experienced a slight decline in after-hours trading, having initially risen nearly 9% to approximately $229 earlier in the day. It is worth noting that a year ago, the shares traded at a mere $51.It is worth noting that during the first quarter of the previous year, Coinbase reported losses of $78.9 million (or 34 cents per share).Moreover, Coinbase’s Q1 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) reached an impressive $1 billion, surpassing the total for the entire previous year. While the quarterly results were overall strong, the exceptional revenue figures were partly boosted by a one-time $737 million paper gain resulting from new accounting rules that allow crypto firms to record price increases in their balance sheets.US Market Share Increased
In a letter to shareholders accompanying the quarterly report, Coinbase highlighted the progress made towards its 2024 priorities of driving revenue, utility, and regulatory clarity.The company emphasized its increased market share in U.S. spot and derivatives, achieving all-time highs on Coinbase Prime, and witnessing a significant increase in USDC market capitalization.Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 chain, Base, launched in August, generated $56.1 million in revenue during the first quarter. Base outperformed Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, and developer activity on the network increased by an impressive 800%. Additionally, Coinbase acquired a minority stake in Circle, the issuer of stablecoin USDC, which experienced a 30% growth in market capitalization in Q1. As a result, Coinbase’s subscriptions and services revenue increased by one-third, including a 15% boost in stablecoin revenue.While Coinbase has diversified its revenue streams with Base and USDC, the recent gains were primarily driven by favorable market conditions. For example, during this quarter, the price of Bitcoin rose by 57% and reached an all-time high of $73,000 due to over $50 billion flowing into 10 spot exchange-traded funds approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 11.However, Coinbase’s transaction expenses also grew significantly, increasing by 73% to $217 million. Looking ahead to Q2, the company estimates its overall expenses to be as high as $890 million, primarily driven by the elevated costs associated with higher trading volumes, including customer support and infrastructure expenses.

Ripple sell-off alert: 200 million XRP reserved for May dumps


Ripple has reserved 200 million out of the 1 billion XRP unlocked in May for its monthly sell-off. This amount is worth nearly $104 million, with XRP price trading below $0.52.
Currently, the company has around 39.70 billion tokens locked in escrows from the initial distribution that never circulated. Ripple unlocks 1 billion of these XRP tokens every month and re-locks an arbitrary amount for further release.
Finbold has tracked these unlocks, identifying patterns that affect the asset’s long-term value and also XRP’s short-term price action.


Notably, Ripple used two new accounts for May’s unlock, starting a new escrow epoch with the ‘Ripple (24)‘ and ‘Ripple (25)‘ labeled accounts. Previously, the company was using ‘Ripple (22)’ and ‘Ripple (23)’, now with no escrows left, as reported on April 30.
Ripple XRP reserves and escrow activity in May
As developed, ‘Ripple (24)’ first sent the 200 million XRP for May’s sell-off to ‘Ripple (1)’. Later, the account sent 300 million tokens to ‘Ripple (13)’ and re-locked the amount for an escrow to September 2027.

Meanwhile, the ‘Ripple (25)’ account sent 500 million to ‘Ripple (12)’, which is also scheduled to finish in September 2027.

XRP price analysis amid Ripple sell-offs
Interestingly, Ripple’s previous sell-offs and escrow activities coincide with meaningful XRP price movements. Finbold placed each of the company’s observed sales year-to-date on XRP’s daily chart.
So far, Ripple made its sales on January 7, 16, and 30, February 5, 11, and 20, March 5 and 13, and April 14 and 24. Interestingly, only three out of ten days had a slightly positive price action. Yet, even these ‘green’ days were made of shy gains, while the negative ones were more impactful.

As of this writing, XRP trades at $0.519, bouncing back from support at $0.50. Therefore, investors should closely monitor Ripple’s selling activities in May, as they could slow down an expected price recovery.

Australian Stock Exchange Set to Approve Spot Bitcoin ETFs by End of 2024



                    

Australia’s major stock exchange, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), may soon give the green light to several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) before the close of 2024.



VanEck Australia and local ETF-focused fund manager BetaShares are poised to have their spot Bitcoin ETF applications approved by year-end, according to insiders cited by Bloomberg, mirroring moves made by fund issuers in the United States and Hong Kong.




The surge in spot Bitcoin ETF applications follows approvals in the United States, where a total of eleven products have amassed a staggering $53 billion in assets under management (AUM).



Justin Arzadon, BetaShares’ head of digital, credited the substantial inflows into U.S.-based ETFs as a catalyst for launching similar products in Australia, asserting they demonstrate the enduring presence of digital assets.



Jeff Yew, CEO of Monochrome, a crypto asset management firm with a competing exchange application, described Australia as a “very crypto-heavy country” and anticipates Australian spot Bitcoin ETFs to draw in $3 billion to $4 billion in net inflows within the initial three years.

Yew highlighted the demand for Bitcoin ETFs among fund managers seeking exposure to Bitcoin, self-managed super fund (SMSF) investors, and a segment of retail investors.



Currently, SMSF investors carry direct exposure to Bitcoin on crypto exchanges, a practice Yew views as inherently risky, akin to a “ticking time bomb” should exchanges falter.



He emphasized the regulatory oversight and safety afforded by Bitcoin ETFs, contrasting them with direct crypto exchange exposure. 




Monochrome initially sought approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the ASX in July 14, 2023, but shifted to Cboe Australia due to the ASX’s prolonged approval process.



Yew cited Cboe Australia’s more pragmatic timeline and transparent listing framework as reasons for the switch, noting the challenges the ASX has faced with regulatory issues and limited appetite for new products. 



Despite this, Yew remains optimistic about Cboe Australia approving Monochrome’s application “within the next few weeks.”

Lian told Cointelegraph:“While it might cause a short-term dip in price due to increased supply and potential panic selling, it doesn’t always mean a long-term downtrend. To me, it is a good thing […] The sell-off would mean a more decentralized distribution of tokens. A broader distribution reduces the risk of a single entity having excessive control over the project.”However, Lian noted that the token’s value will mainly rely on the community’s trust in Friend.tech and how the team manages the current situation.Related: LayerZero cross-chain interoperability protocol completes first airdrop snapshotAirdrop farmers continue to plague token launchesThe mysterious Friend.tech whale is another example of a professional airdrop farmer (squatter) who interacts with emerging protocols solely for the airdrop rewards, often with multiple wallets to compound rewards.The main issue with airdrop farmers is that they tend to market sell all their airdropped tokens, creating significant sell pressure and resulting in more panic selling by legitimate protocol users.An example of this came at the end of April, when the Omni Network’s OMNI token fell 55% in less than 18 hours following its airdrop, losing over half its market capitalization.In March 2023, it was revealed that airdrop hunters consolidated $3.3 million worth of tokens from Arbitrum’s ARB airdrop from 1,496 wallets into just two wallets they had controlled.Related: ‘Mr. 100’ buys the Bitcoin dip for the first time since halving — Is the BTC bottom in?

Logos publishes privacy manifesto on largest-ever Bitcoin block from 2009 - Crypto Briefing




Logos, a decentralized and privacy-focused technology stack, has inscribed its manifesto on the largest-ever Bitcoin block, measuring 3.99 MB in size.The inscription, which precedes the launch of an Ordinals collection called Logos Operators, was made on a satoshi created in 2009 in block 3,479.Logos (also named as Logos Network), characterizes itself as a politically neutral tech stack supporting self-sovereign virtual territories. It provides the technical foundation for cyber states, parallel societies, network states, or any borderless public institution based on voluntary consent.According to Logos, the Logos Operators collection “will serve as the pseudonymous identities of the first inhabitants of the Logos technology stack that will enable people to exit the existing internet system.”The project claims that privacy should be considered a “fundamental right,” with the aim of establishing transparency and self-sovereign monetary policy. “Logos is the ancient Greek concept for the connection between language, reason, and the order of the universe,” the manifesto states.The manifesto was authored by Logos co-founder Jarrad Hope, who also worked as the co-founder of Status, open-source mobile client for Ethereum. Logos envisions a society where individuals are not “treated as machines,” emphasizing anonymity, non-elitism, and the centrality of people in its vision. The project aims to rebuild the internet to protect civil liberties by design and is actively recruiting high-level “Operators” to join the new ecosystem, which they describe as “a sovereign enclave in cyberspace.”The Logos technology stack consists of three modular protocol components, including:
Waku: A peer-to-peer messaging protocol for secure communication
Codex: A decentralized storage solution
Nomos: A Layer 1 blockchain with a focus on privacy and scalability
The project has made significant progress in recent months. Key developments include the launch of Codex Devnet, key participation in various events such as ETHDenver, partnerships with organizations such as Web3Privacy Now, and research into zero-knowledge proofs, consensus solutions, and network architectures.Logos says that the Nomos Layer 1 blockchain is slated for mainnet launch by the end of the year.

First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Hovers Around $59K to End Week

Bitcoin tested a return to $60,000 during the Asian morning on Friday before retreating to trade around $59,000. BTC has gained about 2% in the last 24 hours as it continues its recovery from a midweek rout that saw it sink below $57,000 following a drop of 16% in April, the worst month since June 2022. JPMorgan said in a report yesterday that retail investors played a bigger part in the sell-off than institutional investors. The bank is opting for a cautious stance on crypto markets in the near term due to a lack of positive catalysts. The wider crypto market has risen 1.7% in 24 hours as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20).

There Is No Option of Parole For Sam Bankman-Fried - Defense Attorney


							

According to Carlo D’Angelo, Sam Bankman-Fried’s jail destination would be determined by a couple of factors.



D’Angelo believes Bankman-Fried will not be sent to the same prison as his co-defendants.



With the absence of parole, Bankman-Fried would likely spend not less than 21 years in jail.




Renowned Crypto Criminal Defense Lawyer Carlo D’Angelo has aired his view on developments surrounding the sentencing of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. D’Angelo spoke extensively with Tiffany Fong, a renowned independent journalist covering issues around crypto crimes.







During their interaction, D’Angelo told Fong that several factors would determine Bankman-Fried’s jail destination. He explained that the Bureau of Prisons would recommend a prison destination for the convict based on several considerations. 



According to the defense attorney, the authorities would consider factors like the current inhabitants of a prison. With that, they would know if co-defendants who cooperated and testified against Bankman-Fried during litigation are in the same prison. He highlighted that having Bankman-Fried in the same environment as people who testified against him could cause problems.



D’Angelo noted that the authorities will consider the convict’s specific mental health needs. Hence, they could send him to a unit that can cater to those needs. The litigation expert noted that adding to the individual needs of Bankman-Fried, the prison authorities will try as much as possible to keep him close to his family.









Considering the length of Bankman-Fried’s sentence and the possibility of parole, D’Angelo explained that the convict would get credit for the time he served waiting for trial and sentencing. He clarified that the time credit will not cover the period when Bankman-Fried was under house arrest. 



Other than that, the defense lawyer noted that the U.S. Federal system has abolished parole for prison sentences. However, he clarified that the Bureau of Prison can award “Good Time.” According to him, that could happen if Bankman-Fried avoids having disciplinary issues. However, he noted that generally, convicts like Bankman-Fried are likely to serve about 85% of their jail term within the prison system.

Pro-XRP Lawyers Predict Ripple Will Lose Its Latest Motion


								In the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), pro-XRP community lawyers have offered a pessimistic outlook for Ripple’s latest court motion. Attorney Jeremy Hogan, known for his vocal support of Ripple in the crypto community, expressed via X (formerly Twitter) that he anticipates a loss for Ripple in its recent legal maneuver.
Ripple Will Lose This Time: Pro-XRP Lawyers Claim
Sharing his thoughts on X (formerly Twitter), Hogan remarked, “The hardest thing to do on CT is say that you think the SEC will win a motion. But HERE GOES: I think the SEC will win this motion.” He elaborated that even if the court recognizes the SEC’s witness, Andrea Fox, as an expert, the likely outcome would be similar to previous cases, where the court allowed Ripple to depose the witness rather than striking them from the record entirely. Hogan concluded his statement with a humorous but serious remark, “Now, excuse me while I go pray I’m wrong, which is not often.”
The discussion was sparked by an update from James K. Filan, a former defense lawyer, who reported on Ripple’s filing of a letter in further support of its April 22, 2024 ,motion. The motion was a reply to the SEC’s opposition, which had been filed a week prior, on April 29, 2024.


Bill Morgan, another attorney advocating for XRP, shared Hogan’s sentiment in a separate post. Morgan stated, “I think Ripple will lose the motion but the judge will accept Fox gave some expert evidence and permit Ripple to depose her. Then we can see what SEC says on May 6 in its reply brief on remedies and then await a decision on remedies.”

Notably, the court dealt with a similar situation involving the “Ferrante Declaration” earlier in the case. This declaration, much like the later Fox Declaration, was used by the SEC to summarize financial data and calculations concerning Ripple’s financial activities. Ripple had opposed this declaration, arguing against its admission, but the court permitted it as summary evidence, not as expert testimony.
However, Judge Torres allowed the declaration, treating it as permissible summary evidence under the law, rather than as expert testimony. This previous decision is likely what Jeremy Hogan refers to with “like it did before,” indicating a precedent where the court allowed Ripple to challenge a witness through deposition instead of striking the witness entirely.
Background Of The Motion
At the heart of the dispute is Ripple’s objection to the SEC’s expert declaration by Andrea Fox, which Ripple argues has been improperly categorized by the SEC. According to Ripple, Fox performs a deep analytical review of Ripple’s financial records, drawing conclusions that influence core aspects of the case, such as disgorgement calculations and pre-judgment interest.

According to the filing, “Fox analyzes Ripple’s records, third-party evidence, and expert reports; draws inferences and conclusions about those documents; and calculates disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and discount amounts based on her analysis.”. Ripple emphasizes that this level of analysis requires more than basic arithmetic, countering the SEC’s portrayal of Fox’s role.
Ripple further accuses the SEC of failing to disclose Fox’s involvement as an expert witness during the discovery phase, which they argue is a requirement under the court’s scheduling order. The filing details that the SEC’s late disclosure of Fox does not comply with the agreed timeline which was set to complete remedies-related discovery by February 20, 2024.
“Discovery could not be ‘completed,’ as the Court directed, if the SEC had not yet disclosed a witness whose testimony the agency planned to present and whose deposition Ripple had reserved its right to take”.
Moreover, Ripple contrasts Fox’s extensive and detailed declaration, which includes specialized accounting assessments, against previous summary witness testimonies cited by the SEC, which involved straightforward data compilation without analytical interpretation.
Ripple concludes that the SEC’s approach to Fox’s declaration and her qualifications contradicts their characterization of her as a non-expert, summary witness, and thus, her testimony should be struck for non-compliance with the discovery rules.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.51945.

Coinbase CEO: “Developer Activity on Base Increased Eightfold in Q1” | Cryptoglobe


                                
Base is a Layer-2 blockchain built by Coinbase on top of the Ethereum network. Layer-2 solutions are designed to enhance the scalability and efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain. Base aims to provide a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly environment for building decentralized applications (dApps).



Here’s how it works:



Rollups: Base leverages the power of “rollups,” specifically optimistic rollups. This technique bundles large batches of transactions off of the main Ethereum chain, processing them on Base for faster and cheaper execution. Only a compressed summary of the batch is then submitted back to the Ethereum mainnet for final settlement.Ethereum Security: By settling transactions back onto the Ethereum mainnet, Base inherits the robust security and decentralization properties of Ethereum.OP Stack: Base is built using Optimism’s OP Stack, an open-source toolkit for creating interoperable, cost-effective, and scalable rollups. This shared infrastructure envisions a future “superchain” of connected Layer-2 networks.



Overall, Base wants to facilitate developers’ creation of dApps that are as seamless and affordable to use as traditional web apps while maintaining the security of the Ethereum ecosystem.



Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong highlighted significant advancements in Base during the company’s first-quarter earnings call on May 2, 2024. Armstrong drew an interesting parallel, likening the evolution of blockchain through Layer 2 solutions to the internet’s leap from dial-up to broadband. This evolution is critical as it underpins the potential for blockchain technology to host a plethora of new applications within the crypto economy.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Base has made remarkable strides in enhancing the efficiency of crypto transactions. According to Armstrong, these enhancements are pivotal in achieving Coinbase’s ambitious goal of processing average crypto transactions in under one second for less than one cent worldwide. The impact of Base on the crypto transaction landscape is profound, with transaction fees and confirmation times drastically reduced. This improvement is in line with Coinbase’s strategy to make crypto transactions as seamless and cost-effective as possible.



The first quarter of 2024 saw an eightfold increase in developer activity on Base, indicating growing confidence and interest in its capabilities. Armstrong revealed that in the past 30 days alone, Base has processed more than double the transactions of the entire Ethereum Layer 1 network. This milestone not only underscores Base’s robust performance but also cements its position as the leading Layer 2 solution in terms of transaction volume.



One of the significant enhancements to Base includes an approximate 80% reduction in transaction fees through various protocol upgrades. These lower fees, often below one cent, are particularly advantageous for users and developers who seek efficient and economical blockchain interactions.



Moreover, Armstrong announced the integration of the US Dollar Coin (USDC) on Base across all Coinbase products. This integration facilitates nearly free and instant global payments in a stable, USD-denominated digital asset. Armstrong emphasized the transformative potential of this development, projecting it as a monumental step towards overhauling the global financial system. By significantly reducing the billions in payment fees currently borne by consumers and businesses, Coinbase aims to foster a more accessible and equitable financial ecosystem.

ZeroHedge will host a weird gold v. bitcoin debate today


ZeroHedge, Daniel Ivandjiiski’s popular current events blog and news brand, will moderate a debate tonight between two celebrity gold bugs versus two crypto promoters.
This evening at 7pm EDT, ZeroHedge will host gold bug Peter Schiff and ‘Dr. Doom’ Nouriel Roubini on the anti-crypto side, and Anthony Scaramucci and Erik Voorhees on the pro-crypto side.
The debate, which will stream on YouTube, will be moderated by Crypto Banter channel owner Ran Neuner. Neuner is part of Mario Nawfal’s team that rose to prominence thanks in part to Elon Musk’s endorsements of their Twitter (now X) Spaces. Neuner follows a trend of ZeroHedge using Nawfal’s team to host celebrity debates. Indeed, Nawfal himself has hosted a ZeroHedge debate.
The panelists have debated their pro-gold and pro-crypto arguments on social media for years and if they continue their tradition of talking over each other, Neuner will have to keep a firm grip on the mic controls. 

Read more: FBI and SEC likely investigating Mario Nawfal after wave of complaints
Four conflicted, talkative, bombastic debaters

Erik Voorhees is best known as the founder of ShapeShift, a digital exchange with an interesting history that included transforming into a DAO to dodge know-your-customer and anti-money laundering laws. Even with that dodge, it had to pay a settlement to the Securities and Exchange Commission for listing unregistered securities.
Anthony Scaramucci is a former senior White House staffer-turned-founder of SkyBridge Capital, a hedge fund that made money from some lucky breaks. For example, the fund manager received a phone call from Sam Bankman-Fried’s father seemingly just in time to warn him that FTX was going to collapse. It helps to have the dad of the founder of the largest pyramid scheme since Enron tip you off prior to its collapse, unlike millions of blindsided customers.
Peter Schiff has frequently bashed bitcoin and has called it worthless for years. Indeed, seven years ago, he predicted bitcoin would go to $0.00. He’s managed a gold fund that has underperformed gold for over a decade.
Nouriel Roubini is an anti-bitcoin economist frequently referred to as ‘Dr. Doom.’ He predicted bitcoin would collapse to $0 four years ago.

Neither gold nor crypto have displaced fiat
Roubini and Schiff support gold as the world’s preeminent store of value. Because gold isn’t easy to subdivide, assay, or carry for use as a medium of exchange, Schiff repeatedly endorsed Canadian debit card company GoldMoney as the best way to use gold for day-to-day transactions.
GoldMoney and its gold-backed debit card, however, never gained popularity. GoldMoney’s share price languishes 80% below its all-time high set seven years ago.
Nouriel Roubini (a.k.a. Dr. Doom) predicted bitcoin would collapse to $0 four years ago.
To be fair, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are also not easy to use for day-to-day transactions without relying on a trusted third party. Thousands of crypto merchant service companies and point-of-sale terminals have gone bankrupt. Although crypto is easy to subdivide, assay, carry, and transact on-chain, burdensome financial regulations turn its acceptance, tax treatment, and conversion into fiat an accounting compliance nightmare.
Obviously, Voorhees and Scaramucci are likely to vocalize their typical arguments for crypto like self-sovereignty, censorship-resistance, and unconfiscatability. Roubini and Schiff, meanwhile, might take a jab at Voorhees for running a company that allegedly broke US financial regulations. Voorhees’ company ShapeShift paid a $275,000 penalty to settle SEC claims that it dealt unregistered crypto securities.

3 cryptocurrencies under $0.10 to buy next week


As the current week nears its conclusion with the cryptocurrency market in the state of cautious recovery from the recent losses, some of its assets, still available at a low price threshold of under $0.10 per wholecoin, might be a good investment in the week to come.
In this context, Finbold has scoured the cryptoverse to deliver the list of three digital currencies that are currently trading at the price below just ten cents apiece and which might represent some of the best purchase choices for crypto traders and investors next week.
#1 Shiba Inu (SHIB)
As the first on the list, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently formed a bullish flag pattern on its daily chart, which crypto expert Ali Martinez pointed out could potentially lead to another upward surge, as this classic continuation chart pattern signifies a consolidation period following a strong price increase.



Currently, however, SHIB is changing hands at $0.00002275, which indicates a modest 0.25% loss in the last 24 hours while declining 10.55% across the previous seven days and accumulating a drop of 15.53% over the past month, according to the latest charts.

#2 IoTeX (IOTX)
Meanwhile, another renowned crypto expert, Michaël van de Poppe, has recommended IoTeX (IOTX), a native token of the eponymous EVM-compatible blockchain that employs a global team of more than 40 research scientists and engineers, as he earlier noted that the “altcoins momentum is on the horizon.”

For now, the price of IOTX stands at $0.05338, suggesting a gain of 0.60% on the day, as it moves to reverse the dip of 12.50% from over the past week and the amassed losses of 29.63% in the last 30 days, as per the most recent information retrieved by Finbold on May 3.

#3 SKALE (SKL)
Finally, van de Poppe has also earlier recommended SKALE (SKL), a token of the modular blockchain network promising to bring scalability to Ethereum (ETH) and which the crypto specialist recommended as an altcoin to “generate a 3X in BTC, with the lowest amount of risk.”

That said, at press time, SKL was trading at the price of $0.07321, having dropped 2.17% during the day, after declining 18.59% last week and making a more significant dive of 38.73% on its monthly chart, according to the latest data.

Conclusion
All things considered, accumulating the above cryptocurrencies under $0.10 might be a good idea for the upcoming week, but it is important to remember that things in this sector can sometimes make a sudden turn, so doing one’s own research is critical before investing in any of them.

In addition to its financial achievements, Cheniere has confidently reconfirmed its full-year 2024 financial guidance, projecting a Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA ranging between $5.5 billion to $6.0 billion and a Distributable Cash Flow between $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion.



This forward-looking stance is supported by the company’s comprehensive capital allocation plan, which saw the repurchase of approximately 7.5 million shares of common stock for about $1.2 billion, the prepayment of $150 million of consolidated long-term indebtedness, and the payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.435 per share of common stock.



Cheniere Energy Outperforms Revenue Expectations in Q1, EPS Miss



Cheniere’s performance in the first quarter notably exceeded revenue expectations ($4.25 billion reported against $3.97 billion expected) with the actual earnings per share (EPS) of $2.13 falling short of the expected $2.29.



The comparison of these results against market expectations underscores Cheniere’s robust business model and its adeptness in navigating the complexities of the energy sector. 





Cheniere’s Guidance for Full Year 2024 Remains Optimistic



Looking ahead, Cheniere’s guidance for the full year 2024 remains optimistic, with the company poised to achieve its projected financial targets. This optimism is rooted in the company’s strategic initiatives and operational efficiencies, which are expected to continue driving growth and profitability. Cheniere’s focus on excellence in execution across its operations, construction, and project development initiatives is pivotal to its success.



The company’s ongoing pursuit of LNG capacity expansions at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi further exemplifies its commitment to enhancing energy security, reliability, and environmental benefits for its customers. With a proven track record and a clear strategic vision, Cheniere is well-positioned to navigate the future challenges and opportunities within the global LNG market, thereby delivering sustained value to its stakeholders.

NodeMonkes surged to the top of the non-fungible token (NFT) market on Thursday with over US$1.62 million in sales. 



The sales spike on Thursday pushed NodeMonkes’ all-time sales volume to US$210.72 million, as it flipped $SATS BRC-20 NFTs to become the top Bitcoin collection.



NodeMonkes also snapped a six-day streak of under US$1 million in sales after recording US$934,294 the day before, CryptoSlam data shows.



The second-highest performing collection of the day is CryptoPunks, with a daily sales volume of US$1.33 million, a 488% leap from the day before.

	
	
	
	


CryptoPunks’ all-time sales volume now stands at an impressive US$2.82 billion as the third best-selling set of NFTs.



CryptoPunk 7846 was the highest-valued NFT to change hands on Thursday. It sold for US$557,804 in Ether, around US$300,000 lower than its last sale.



Fellow Ethereum collection Bored Ape Yacht Club claimed the third spot in daily sales, generating US$1.06 million. Yuga Labs’ flagship collection is the second best-selling NFT, withUS$3.14 billion.

Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE) Launches on Solana, Will Rally 7,200% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Skinny Doge (SKINDOGE), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Skinny Doge presents a similar opportunity.



Skinny Doge has market cap below $13,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,200% in the coming two days, and Skinny Doge could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Skinny Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Skinny Doge on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Skinny Doge by entering its contract address – 913qkdtENF3qvSBZjtoNxETZi93xHgRDuHNGvdzkECF4 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SKINDOGE.

Top Analyst Says One Blue-Chip Altcoin ‘Begging To Break Out,’ Updates Outlook on Bitcoin and Ethereum - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is expressing bullish sentiment on a top-10 altcoin by market capitalization.
The analyst pseudonymously known as DonAlt tells 59,100 subscribers of the TechnicalRoundup YouTube channel that the price action of BNB, the native token of the BNB Chain, is currently signaling massive upside potential.










“I like BNB… I like the BNB chart. This is BNB/USD [chart], it’s basically begging to break out. I think a dip on this would just be a buy.”
BNB is trading at $561 at time of writing.
According to the pseudonymous analyst, the fourth-largest crypto asset by market cap would cease being attractive for a long opportunity if it drops by around 20% from the current level.
“Anything below $450 would start looking a little bit dicey. But just generally this just looks very strong. 
And then if you go on the BNB/BTC pair, you see what absolute dominance looks like. That’s actually a really good looking chart. So if you actually want to have a coin that looks good… BNB is one of them. That chart looks excellent.”
Next up is Bitcoin (BTC). According to the closely followed analyst, the behavior of Bitcoin around two key levels will signal where the flagship crypto asset is likely to head to next.
“I think any close above $70,000 [on the monthly chart] is probably going to go towards $80,000, $90,000… any close below $57,000 is probably going to go towards like $45,000.”
Bitcoin is trading at $58,840 at time of writing.
On Ethereum (ETH), DonAlt says,
“If the weekly closes above $3,000 this week… then we can talk about maybe going back to $4,000. So like I’m more bullish in ETH than I have been in almost years at this point.”
Ethereum is trading at $2,988 at time of writing.

Friend.tech Community in Uproar Amid Token and V2 Launch - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsSocial crypto platform Friend.tech has launched its new native token alongside version two (V2) of the decentralized social media. But so far, it's not going very smoothly.FRIEND tokens were supposed to be airdropped to those captured in an April snapshot. Unfortunately, it appears that many users have struggled to claim their tokens.“Literally all my friend.tech points are gone and I have 0 FRIEND to claim?” one Twitter user panicked. “I'm NOT selling my FRIEND airdrop (Cause I can't even claim it),” another said.Friend.tech launched in August 2023, quickly gaining a ton of hype as well as a fair few critics. The decentralized social network, on Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Base, allows users to buy and sell “keys” that are linked to Twitter accounts.Friend.tech did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.Now with the launch of version two of the platform, which happened alongside the token airdrop, users are also able to join community owned spaces called Clubs that are operated by key holders.But even those who managed to claim their tokens weren’t happy with its price tanking 46% from $2.78 to $1.49 in less than four hours, according to CoinGecko. The community believes the devs only adding $0.01 in liquidity is the primary factor in its value tanking so quickly.Even those who were in it for the social media platform were left short changed as it appears that the new Clubs feature—a key step for gaining airdrop eligibility—isn’t working as planned. Users are reporting that the platform is not registering that they have joined a club or that newly made clubs aren’t showing on the platform.“This shitty SocialFi app [is] still not verifying [the] join club step,” one Twitter user moaned. “I hate Friendtech.”This has resulted in a number of community members turning against what was previously the darling of the Web3 industry—some threatening to dump their tokens the moment they’re airdropped.“I had a lot of hope with friend.tech V2,” Twitter user mcSleuth said. “Here we are after V2, app still looks like shit, is slow as fuck and after 8 months the only update we got was 'clubs' (which people are only using to claim their airdrop and dump it).” He continued, “how does one fumble this bad.”Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Binance helped ED In India, Exposed Scam Apps


                                Binance Gives Hand To ED To Cut Off Scam Apps In India                                Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange is getting ready to come back to India After being banned for a while in the Indian market, preparing to pay a fine of $2 million. However, Besides this, Binance has taken a step that could improve its standing with the Indian government. Recently, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in India cracked down on an online scam app named E-Nuggets, seizing around $10 million. What's particularly noteworthy is that Binance, along with ZebPay and WazirX helped ED in uncovering this significant scam. According to reports, E-Nuggets had approximately $10 million stored across 70 different cryptocurrency wallets associated with these three exchanges. The ED reached out to them to block these wallet addresses and transfer the crypto assets to the agency's wallet, and all three exchanges cooperated. By assisting in exposing a scam app, Binance seems to be trying to demonstrate to the Indian government its commitment to following all regulations and also aiding in stopping any illegal activities. This fits with Binance's plan to meet all of India's conditions before fully coming back into the market.Binance Keen To Get Back In Good Books Of Indian GovernmentBinance aims to get back in the good books of the Indian government. After being banned in India for about four months now again Binance is fully prepared to return. Recently, the Binance Exchange paid a fine of $2 million for this purpose. Binance is ready to comply with all the conditions set by the Indian government for its return, including registration with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), paying penalties, and following all applicable laws in India, such as the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the VDA Taxation Framework. In doing so, assisting the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in cracking down on a scam app is also part of Binance's strategy. This sends a message to the Indian government that Binance not only intends to abide by all necessary rules in India but also is willing to assist the government in preventing any illegal activities.ConclusionAccording to Coin Gabbar, Binance understands that to capture big markets like India, it must comply with all the conditions set by the Indian government. If it falls behind in doing so, it might face expulsion from the country. However, considering the current situation, being excluded from significant markets like India could be detrimental for any crypto exchange, especially for Binance, which is the world's largest crypto exchange. Therefore, Binance is not only willing to stand by all rules and regulations in India but also planning to introduce payment solutions, establish a dedicated Indian team, and invest in India's blockchain system. It can be hoped that Binance will soon be included in the good books of the Indian government and may receive some concessions from the Indian government in the future. This step will help Binance run its operations smoothly in significant countries like India. Also Read: Block Co-Founder Jack Dorsey Planning To Buy BTC

April Job Report Shows Cooling Labor Market, Unemployment Hits 3.9% - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April job report on Friday, revealing a cooling labor market with narrower job gains across several major industries. The report showed that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in April, falling short of economists’ expectations.



Despite the slowdown in job growth, the unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.9%, while average hourly earnings increased by 0.2% month-over-month and 3.9% year-over-year. 



Job Growth and Wage Pressures



The healthcare industry led the way in job creation, adding 56,000 jobs, followed by social assistance with 31,000 jobs, transportation and warehousing with 22,000 jobs, and retail trade with 20,000 jobs. The average workweek was reduced to 34.3 hours, indicating a potential slowdown in economic activity. Revisions to previous months’ job growth figures showed that February’s job growth was revised down from 270,000 to 236,000, while March’s job growth was revised up from 303,000 to 315,000.



Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that wage pressures were not creating a significant inflationary impulse, citing declining trends from peak levels during the post-pandemic recovery period. The labor force participation rate held steady at 62.7%, and the employment-population ratio remained little changed at 60.2%.





Market Reaction and Economic Implications



As of the time of writing, the stock market responded positively to the April job report, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rising by 322.37 points or 0.85%, the NASDAQ Composite increasing by 235.48 points or 1.51%, and the S&P 500 gaining 45.81 points or 0.91%. The bond market reaction, however, suggested an increase in demand for safer investments, with the US 10-year Treasury Yield dropping by 0.096 percentage points to 4.475%, possibly due to concerns over slowing job growth and uncertainty over future economic growth.



Commodities like gold and oil rose, with gold increasing by $13.4 or 0.58% and crude oil going up by $0.59 or 0.75%, indicating a hedge against potential inflation and economic uncertainty. The Euro (EUR/USD) slightly strengthened against the dollar, moving up by 0.718%, while the Japanese Yen (USD/JPY) weakened against the dollar, dropping by 1.015%.



The April job report suggests that the U.S. economy is experiencing a gradual slowdown in job growth, which may help ease inflationary pressures. However, the slower pace of job creation also raises concerns about the sustainability of the economic recovery and the potential impact on consumer spending and business investment.



As the Federal Reserve continues to monitor the labor market and inflation data, policymakers will need to carefully navigate the challenges of maintaining price stability while supporting economic growth in the coming months.







Do you think the Federal Reserve will conduct two rate cuts this year, as expected by consensus after the jobs report? Let us know in the comments.

We Asked AI to Predict Kentucky Derby Winners-Here Are Its Picks - Decrypt

In the world of horse racing, tomorrow's Kentucky Derby is the Super Bowl, the World Series, and the NBA Finals all rolled into one. The “greatest two minutes in sports” is the marquee matchup in a series of over a dozen races, but if predicting the outcome of the March Madness basketball tourney is tricky, it gets even harder when you combine both human and equine unpredictability.Throw in factors like the weather and conditions of each race track, and the odds of picking winners—the obsession that drives the $500 billion horse racing market—are not exactly in your favor.In one 20-horse race, the odds of correctly picking the winner are simply 1 in 20. But wagering on horse races can get  complicated. If you want to predict the exact order of the top two, three, or four horses, known as an exacta, trifecta, and superfecta, the odds skyrocket to 1 in 380, 1 in 6,840, and 1 in 103,025.But wait! There's more! Players often “box” their choices to increase the chance of winning. This means they bet on all possible combinations of their favored horses. The odds of winning a boxed exotic bet are better than playing them straight, 1 in 190 for a boxed exacta, 1 in 1,140 for a boxed trifecta, and 1 in 16,215 for a boxed superfecta. However, the payouts are also reduced accordingly.Some bettors might relish the prospect of spending hours poring over stats and racing forms, but we invested our time in creating a tool to get us to an answer more quickly—meanwhile crafting a system that can be called up when the next Kentucky Derby draws near.Enter AIThere are a variety of ways to enlist artificial intelligence in horse racing. You could process reams of data based on your own methodology, trust a third-party pre-trained model, or even build a bespoke solution from the ground up. We decided to build a GPT we named it HorseGPT to crunch the numbers and make the picks for us.A GPT is a type of AI agent built atop a large language model like ChatGPT from market leader OpenAI. A customized agent works with a set of pre-defined prompts and training data to guide its behavior. This approach is less complex than training a model from the ground up, but proved to be good enough to pick winners and defend those choices.We did start from scratch in one sense: we were completely new to playing the horses, and don't know the first thing about “handicapping nags” or other terms of art. The most popular AI chatbots were similarly ignorant at first.We carefully curated prompts to instill HorseGPT with expertise in data science specific to horse racing: how weather affects times, the role of jockeys and riding styles, the importance of post positions, and so on. We then fed it a mix of research papers and blogs covering the theoretical aspects of wagering, and layered on practical knowledge: how to read racing forms, what the statistics mean, which factors are most predictive, expert betting strategies, and more.Finally, we gave HorseGPT a wealth of historical Kentucky Derby data, arming it with the raw information needed to put its freshly imparted skills to use.We unleashed HorseGPT on official racing forms for this year's Derby. We asked HorseGPT to carefully analyze each race's form, identify the top contenders, and recommend wager types and strategies based on deep background knowledge derived from race statistics.The big fourWithout further ado, here are HorseGPT's predictions for the 150th “Running of the Roses” at the 2024 Kentucky Derby on Saturday. The main race is race number 12.Given the profiles of the horses and their racing styles, here’s its recommended betting strategy:
Win Bets: Place win bets on both Sierra Leone and Fierceness. These horses have demonstrated consistent performance and high potential for winning, making them solid choices for direct win bets.
Each-Way Bet: Consider an each-way bet on Just a Touch. This horse shows potential but might not be as strong a favorite as the others, offering a good balance for a bet that covers both winning and placing.
As for so-called exotic bets?
Exacta Box: Box Sierra Leone and Fierceness in an exacta. This bet will win if either horse finishes first and the other second, in any order.
Trifecta Box: Box Sierra Leone, Fierceness, and Just a Touch. This covers more combinations, increasing the chance of a high payout if these top contenders finish in the top three in any order.
Superfecta Bet: For a higher-risk but higher-reward bet, place a superfecta picking Sierra Leone, Fierceness, Just a Touch, and include a dark horse like Mystik Dan or Domestic Product based on their potential to outperform expectations under muddy conditions.
A second and third opinionTo double and triple check our work, we did give other powerful AI tools and models a spin. However, building agents with Claude or Reka required API credits and careful coding. Cutting to the chase, we attempted to rely on their  respective massive training datasets, building an elaborate prompt to secure their winning picks.Interestingly enough, our HorseGPT AI agent and the other out-of-the-box chatbots seemed to agree with each other, and with many experts analysts cited by the official Kentucky Derby website. Just a Touch was the only aberration. HorseGPT put it in a top-three spot, but the other experts—AI and human—went with Catching Freedom instead.That said, some human experts like James Cully and Kaitilin Free are also optimistic about Just a TOuch.The top three by consensus among our AIs and our mixed slate of experts is to bet on Sierra Leone, Fierceness, and Catching Freedom.Hold your horsesWe didn't know how to read a racing form, but HorseGPT could break down each statistic and factor in mere minutes after being coached with prompts and research material. We may not be handicapping savants, but we fed our model information provided by experts. That's the power of these large language models: if you know how to work with a chatbot, but once you've ‘taught’ them and fed them high-quality information, they rapidly acquire domain expertise.But before you rush off to place bets—if allowed under the laws of your local jurisdiction—remember that predicting anything as messy as humans—whether it's bracketology, horse racing, or even stock market trends—requires nuance. AI and conventional mathematic models analyze past performance and make predictions based on "ceteris paribus," or status quo, conditions.But they can't predict extraordinary circumstances like an injury, a sudden rain, or a jockey or horse simply having a bad day. That unpredictability, of course, is part of the thrill.Bonus picks for the other racesUnlike a human bettor, HorseGPT doesn't tire of crunching numbers. So we also asked our AI model to digest the racing form for each of the other eleven races this weekend. The amount of data available was not the same, admittedly, but HorseGPT applied the same methodology. For the completists, here were the results.Race 1:Win Bet: Pure Force is a strong candidate for a win bet given his solid workouts, strong breeding, and trainer's track record.Exotic Bets:
Exacta: Box Pure Force and Evan On Earth. Both horses have shown good form and could end up as the top two.
Trifecta: Box Pure Force, Evan On Earth, and Top Gun Rocket. Adding Top Gun Rocket could catch a mid-pack finisher improving with equipment changes.
Superfecta: Add Lou's Legacy to the trifecta box for a superfecta bet, banking on his consistency to grab a lower-tier finish.
Race 2:Win Bet: Scylla due to strong performances and favorable conditions.Exotic Bets:
Exacta Box: Play with Scylla, Coppa Girl, and Joke Sisi.
Trifecta Box: Add Steel Racer for depth given the competitive ML odds and past performance.
Superfecta: Include Zawish and Victorious for their potential in past performance at Churchill Downs.
Race 3:Win Bet: Mindframe due to the highest potential shown in debut and strong workouts.Exotic Bets:
Exacta Box: Mindframe and Invigorated. Both horses show strong early career forms.
Trifecta Part Wheel: Mindframe, Invigorated, and Cornishman in varying positions.
Superfecta Additions: Consider adding Elephants Ear and Bee Dancer for their consistent performances to increase coverage.
Race 4:Win Bet: Place win bets on Best Actor due to high consistency and performance, particularly if the track remains dry.Exotic Bets:
Place/Show Bets: Strong Quality and U. S. Army are good candidates for Place and Show bets, offering a balance of risk and reward with their solid track records.
Exactas and Trifectas: Consider an exacta box between Best Actor, Strong Quality, and U. S. Army. For trifectas, adding a slightly less favored horse like Denington or Five Star General might yield higher payouts if they manage to sneak into the top three.
Race 5:Top Picks: Pure Force and Lou's Legacy stand out based on their training and past performances.Win Bet: Pure Force seems a strong contender for a win bet.Exotic Bets:
Consider a box with Pure Force, Lou's Legacy, and Evan On Earth.
Longshot Bet: Manfredi could be a valuable bet for superfecta placements due to his fast training times despite low race figures.
Race 6:Win/Place Bets: Alva Starr and Vahva are the most consistent and should be considered for win/place bets.Exotic Bets:
Consider a trifecta box including Alva Starr, Red Carpet Ready, and Vahva. This selection balances the field's top performers with proven records.
Longshots: For those looking for higher risk but higher reward bets, consider adding Flying Connection to exotic bets like superfecta given her decent performance but lower rating.
Race 7:Win Bets: Chili Flag and Walkathon are compelling choices for win bets due to their strong performances and experience on turf.Place/Show Bets: Ag Bullet and Cairo Consort are suitable for place and show bets, given their solid records and ability to perform under pressure.Exotic Bets: Consider a trifecta or superfecta box including Chili Flag, Walkathon, Ag Bullet, and Cairo Consort to capitalize on their combined strengths.Race 8:Win Bets: Top Conor and Nash appear to be the strongest bets based on their high Beyer figures and earnings.
Place/Show Bets: Consider Beeline and Vlahos for place/show bets due to their potential and performance metrics.Exotic Bets: A trifecta box involving Top Conor, Nash, and Beeline or Vlahos might be promising. Adjust based on the latest track conditions and any pre-race observations.Race 9:Top Picks for Dry Track: Legend of Time, Neat, and Set.Top Picks for Muddy Track: Legend of Time, Neat, and Cugino.Exotic Bets: Consider a trifecta box including Legend of Time, Neat, and Set or Cugino. Add Stay Hot for superfecta bets, particularly in dry conditions.Potential Longshots: Blue Eyed George and Lord Bullingdon could offer value in more complex betting structures like superfectas due to their moderate ratings but potential for upset.Race 10:Win Bets: Tejano Twist and Gun Pilot appear to be strong choices based on their Beyer figures and proven performances.Place/Show Bets: Mr. Wireless and Three Technique are suitable for place and show bets, given their solid records.Exotic Bets: Consider a trifecta or superfecta including Tejano Twist, Gun Pilot, Mr. Wireless, and Three Technique to capitalize on their combined strengths.Race 11:Win Bets: I'm Very Busy stands out due to its high Beyer figure and recent performance, making it a strong candidate for win bets.Place/Show Bets: Integration and Program Trading have shown consistent performance, making them good candidates for place or show bets.Exotic Bets: A trifecta box involving I'm Very Busy, Far Bridge, and Program Trading could yield a high return, leveraging their combined strengths and track compatibility.Race 13:Win Bet: General Partner: due to its strong performances, highest earnings in the field, and solid Beyer figures.Place/Show Bets:
Discreet Mischief: Bet on place/show given its impressive Beyer of 117 and proven ability in dirt sprints, making it a strong candidate in dry conditions.
Jefferson Street: Also consider for place/show due to its solid performance history and good adaptability to both dry and slightly muddy conditions.
Exotic Bets:
Exacta Box: General Partner and Discreet Mischief: These two horses because of their top performance metrics and proven track records, which make them the strongest contenders for the top two positions.
Trifecta Box: General Partner, Discreet Mischief, and Jefferson Street: Add Jefferson Street for its consistent earning and ability to finish strong, making this trio likely to dominate the top three spots.
Superfecta: Include Pirate or Raging Torrent: Consider these for the fourth spot in superfecta bets.

USDC overtakes USDT: Compliance is key to stablecoin dominance

Tether has long dominated the stablecoin sector thanks in large part to USDT’s status as the first fiat-backed stablecoin.However, new serious competitors have entered the stablecoin market over the past several years, giving USDT (USDT) a run for its money.Since 2024, the transaction volume of Circle’s stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), has been on the rise. According to payments giant Visa, USDC’s monthly transactions flipped USDT for the first time in December 2023. In March 2024, USDC’s transaction volume began to rise steadily, maintaining its dominance while USDT lost transaction volume. On March 24, 2024, USDC closed the week with almost five times more volume than USDT. On April 21, 2024, USDT’s weekly transaction volume downtrend continued, shrinking to $89 billion while USDC increased to $455 billion.While USDC launched in 2018, it has already reached 20% of the total stablecoin market. The battle for stablecoin leadership is clearly between USDT and USDC, as together they cover 90% of the total stablecoin market, according to a January 2024 report from crypto exchange OKX.According to on-chain data, USDC is absorbing crypto’s institutional adoption. This may threaten USDT’s hegemony, as institutional investors are expected to drive the bull market.Stablecoins race to attract institutional investors The crypto market has evolved greatly over the years, from a market flooded by fraudulent projects in the initial coin offering (ICO) era to a market that is set to onboard major institutional investors following the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds earlier this year. The crypto market has matured and may have stepped into a “new phase” where “compliance is super important,” as former Binane CEO Changpeng Zhao posted on X on May 2.Recent: Bitcoin L2s set to explode as Runes congest BTC networkThis focus on compliance is opening up competition between companies that wish to attract the new wave of investors entering the crypto market — i.e., stablecoins that are compliant will come out on top.In this regard, USDT — which has previously been the target of reports casting doubt on the fidelity of its reserves — faces a challenge.Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at fintech firm and crypto exchange YouHodler, told Cointelegraph:“USDT is an offshore stablecoin with a lack of transparency and regulation, while USDC is closely watched by U.S. authorities.”Tether is based in the British Virgin Islands, which is considered a tax haven for off-shore banking. In contrast, USDC issuer Circle is under U.S. jurisdiction, as it’s based in Boston, Massachusetts. USDC’s strategy of branding itself as a fully regulated, transparent stablecoin may be pushing Tether to try to clean up its public image. On April 1, it completed a “gold standard” independent audit from the ​​American Institute of Certified Accountants.Upcoming regulation frameworks in the United States and Europe may be factors that attract regulatory-compliant users to use USDC over USDT. On April 17, the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act was introduced in the United States Congress. If it becomes law, it will affect all stablecoins in the U.S. market.If Tether wishes to get a stamp of approval from U.S. authorities, it will need to change its off-shore establishment to avoid missing out on one of the biggest markets in the world.In the European Union market, the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets regulatory framework will require stablecoin issuers to register as e-money issuers starting June 30. In anticipation of the regulations coming into full effect later this year, Circle has placed EURC — the sister version of USDC, pegged to the euro — in an advantageous position. Recent: Binance ties SAFU fund to USDC: Is the fund missing out on potential gains?On March 21, 2023, Circle applied for a Digital Asset Service Provider license from the French regulatory authorities. The permissions would grant Circle to become a registered digital asset service provider, which would “enable Circle to on-shore its flagship product for the European market” and “begin the process to become MiCA conforming e-money token under the new regime,” according to a press release. Tether still hasn’t applied to become an e-money issuer in the EU.USDC’s consolidation in transaction volume may be a cue that Tether should not ignore. If it becomes the norm, Tether may have already lost its crown as the king of stablecoins.

FTX Exec Loses Paradise, Surrenders $5.9 Million Bahamas Mansion


								The implosion of cryptocurrency giant FTX continues to cast a long shadow, with the latest twist involving a Bahamas mansion and a plea deal. Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, a subsidiary of the now-bankrupt exchange, has agreed to forfeit his luxury home on the Caribbean island as part of a criminal prosecution settlement.

FTX: The Spectacular Rise And Fall
Once a shining star in the crypto-verse, FTX boasted a valuation of $32 billion at its peak. However, the company’s house of cards came tumbling down in November 2022. Allegations of misuse of customer funds and mismanagement sparked a liquidity crisis, leading to the crypto exchange’s sudden bankruptcy filing. The collapse sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, wiping out billions of dollars in investor wealth and eroding trust in the industry.


Salame’s Bahamas Dealings
According to court documents filed by the company’s debtors with the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, Salame faces charges of conspiracy to make illegal campaign contributions, mislead election authorities, and operate an unlicensed money transmitter business. The filing also sheds light on a curious Bahamas property transaction.
A $5.9 Million House Financed By Alameda Research
The court documents allege that in September 2021, Salame agreed to purchase a $7.2 million mansion in the Bahamas. Notably, a 10% deposit for the property came from an account belonging to Alameda Research, another FTX affiliate implicated in the exchange’s downfall. Just two months later, FTX Digital Markets itself wired the remaining balance to Salame’s attorney from a Bahamas bank account.

Excerpt of US Bankruptcy Court vs Ryan Salame
Turning A Paradise Property Into Repayment
With Salame pleading guilty to the criminal charges, the plea deal offers a unique solution. Instead of a traditional cash restitution of $5.6 million, Salame will surrender ownership of his Bahamas residence to FTX debtors. This arrangement seems to benefit both parties.
Salame avoids the hassle and potential financial loss of selling the property in a currently sluggish Bahamas real estate market, where high-end sales volumes have reportedly dropped by as much as 25%. For FTX debtors, the mansion presents a tangible asset that can be liquidated to recoup some of the lost funds owed to creditors.

Lingering Questions And Regulatory Scrutiny
The FTX saga continues to raise questions about the company’s internal financial controls and the conduct of its executives. Salame’s Bahamas property deal, funded by an FTX affiliate, raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the use of customer funds.

Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs To Reach $1 Billion AUM By 2024 End, Kraken Unit Predicts | Bitcoinist.com


								London-based CF Benchmarks, a unit of crypto exchange Kraken, is positioning itself as a notable beneficiary of the surge in spot Bitcoin ETFs this year and shares an increasingly bullish outlook for the ETF market in Hong Kong and the US through 2024. 
According to Bloomberg, with the recent debut of these ETFs in the US in January and their subsequent launch in Hong Kong, CF Benchmarks has become a key reference data provider for approximately $24 billion of cryptocurrency ETFs. This figure is dominated by Bitcoin funds, including the $15.9 billion vehicle offered by BlackRock in the US.
Bitcoin ETFs Set To Shine In Hong Kong
CF Benchmarks licenses its benchmarks to the ETFs and earns fees based on assets under management. The company currently represents around half of the crypto benchmarking market and is actively collaborating with the new Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong. 

Sui Chung, the CEO of CF Benchmarks, told Bloomberg that he envisions expanding crypto ETFs into other markets such as South Korea and Israel. Chung notes that South Korea, in particular, has seen ETFs become the preferred option for long-term savings and has shown a high level of adoption of digital assets.
Notably, while CF Benchmarks initially anticipated $5 billion in assets for the US spot-Bitcoin ETFs utilizing its indexes, the actual amount has exceeded four times that figure. 
Looking ahead, Chung expects the Hong Kong products to accumulate as much as $1 billion in funds under management by the end of 2024.
Contrasting Trends
The introduction of ETFs in the US sparked a significant rally, propelling Bitcoin to an all-time high of nearly $74,000 in March. However, since then, the token has experienced a decline, shedding approximately 20%, to a current trading price of $59,000 as investor demand for the funds waned.

On Wednesday, the group of nearly a dozen US products faced its largest daily net outflow, resulting in assets under management standing at approximately $47 billion.

On the other hand, Hong Kong’s emerging market recorded a trading volume of HK$48.91 million (approximately US$6.26 million) for six Hong Kong-based ETFs on May 3. 
Among the six Hong Kong spot ETFs for virtual assets, the Bitcoin ETF commanded the lion’s share of trading volume, accounting for HK$43.41 million. Additionally, the Ethereum ETF recorded a trading volume of HK$5.5 million.
In contrast to the Hong Kong market, the trading volume of US-based Bitcoin ETFs soared to an impressive $1.72 billion on May 2.

EigenLayer has been in the news this week after it announced its ‘stakedrop,’ where it will distribute EIGEN tokens to early users of the restaking platform. 
Sreeram Kannan, founder and CEO of EigenLayer, and Robert Drost, CEO and executive director of the Eigen Foundation, discuss the launch of the token, a “universal intersubjective work token” and how it allows for slashing, or penalizing, for externally observable faults, such as data unavailability. The Eigen Foundation, a non-profit entity based in the Cayman Islands, was also recently established to grow the protocol and assist in creating a decentralized community. 
They also address criticisms of the token’s launch, including geoblocking and the initial non-transferability of stakedrops for the community and explain why they decided to allocate an additional 100 EIGEN tokens for all participants in the stakedrop. Plus, they reveal a target date by when a decision about the token unlock date should be made. 
Show highlights:

The Bitcoin halving is over - greener mining is coming - Blockworks


People typically care about price above all else when it comes to the Bitcoin halving.
Instead, what they should be paying attention to is the net positive Bitcoin can have for the future of humanity. 
While Bitcoin has long been criticized for being bad for the environment, the trend toward renewables and mining actually shows the opposite. Yes, fossil fuels are still a major component of the Bitcoin network, but with the halving freshly behind us and the block subsidy cut in half, miners with fewer operational expenses, like renewables, will continue their ascent. 
The halving will be a catalyst for a greener, more renewable bitcoin mining movement to finally be recognized among its most staunch critics as a net positive for the environment.
Fossil fuels are the fiat of bitcoin mining 
Bitcoin mining has been constantly criticized for its energy consumption and use of non-renewable energy sources. While the trend is reversing, a significant portion of bitcoin mining still relies on fossil fuels. 
But why has there been a reliance on fossil fuels in the first place? Simply because fossil fuels have incredibly high energy density and are relatively stable, making them ideal as an energy carrier. 
Read more from our opinion section: This Bitcoin halving cycle, miners need a new energy strategy
While fossil fuel plants have relatively low upfront costs to build, they require the continuous procurement of fuel, i.e. low capex high opex. And that fuel is subject to variable pricing and increasingly prone to shocks. With climate change taking center stage this year, and with the role fossil fuels play, there is increased regulatory risk. Fossil fuels are essentially borrowing against the future for instant gratification, and it is we the people who will inevitably foot the bill for the consequences, with compounding interest. This is the definition of high time preference thinking — and it’s antithetical to Bitcoin’s philosophy. 
But the good news is that there is a trend toward renewables and longer term, low time preference thinking already taking shape. 
The economics of renewables 
In addition to the environmental benefits, the shift towards renewable energy sources in bitcoin mining also makes economic sense. While renewables have a high initial capital expense, once they are installed, the energy produced has a low marginal cost — it costs nothing for the sun to shine or the wind to blow or the geo to therm. If there is no buyer for any given kWh, then the cost of said unit of energy will go to $0. This is increasingly the case for renewable generation capacity that has yet to connect to the grid.
What’s more, renewable energy sources like ocean thermal, wind and solar power, have become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels in recent years. As a result, miners using renewable energy sources can enjoy lower operational costs, making them better positioned to weather the reduced block subsidy as we progress through the fifth epoch. 
Additionally, the use of renewable energy sources enables energy sovereignty and decentralization. Whereas only a few nations have fossil fuel deposits, every country has access to renewables. This has led to massive centralization in the energy industry where a handful of super majors and state-run oil companies exert vertical control on the entire supply chain. 
Facing the long term economics  
Despite the economics favoring renewables over fossil fuels for the bitcoin mining industry, there are still challenges to overcome in the long term. The external cost of fossil fuel use has yet to be factored into their cost. This amounts to a government and taxpayer subsidy that artificially depresses the price today, making fossil fuel use more attractive in the short term.
What’s more, the intermittency of some renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, poses grid balancing challenges. But in areas with significant renewable energy resources, like Texas, bitcoin mining is gaining recognition for its ability to nearly instantaneously cycle on and off. During times of excess production, mining facilities provide a buyer for unused energy, while during high demand, the facilities are able to shut down to free up that power. This unique attribute is being integrated directly into the generation side, expanding renewables to new frontiers.
Gradually, then suddenly
As bitcoin mining continues to favor renewables and decarbonize energy markets in this fifth epoch, it will be undeniable how powerful this one two punch is. We will see more renewable, off-grid mining operations pop up, and we will even see historically dominant fossil fuel miners integrate renewables into their mix. It will likely take bitcoin mining catalyzing a new renewable energy source, like ocean thermal, for some of the staunchest critics outside of the industry to come around and see mining as a net positive. But it’s only a matter of time.

Apple Shatters Records with Unprecedented $110 Billion Stock Buyback | Cryptoglobe


                                
Tech giant Apple unveiled a record $110 billion stock buyback program, the largest ever seen in the United States above the firm’s own previous buyback programs of $90 to $100 billion seen in 2021 and 2018, respectively.



Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said the number is “astonishing,” with sheer size of the buyback program sparking speculation, as  some analysts suggested it signals a shift in Apple’s identity.



Sosnick posits that Apple might be transitioning from a “high-powered growth stock” reliant on research and development to a “value stock” prioritizing shareholder returns.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The company holds the top six spots on the list of the ten largest U.S. share-repurchase announcements, further distancing itself from competitors like Chevron, whose largest buyback was of $75 billion, and Google’s parent company Alphabet, whose largest buyback was of $70 billion.



The news of the buyback program coincided with Apple’s positive quarterly results, exceeding Wall Street expectations. The company not only surpassed sales estimates but also projected a return to revenue growth in the current quarter.



Additionally, Apple extended its streak of consecutive quarterly dividend increases to twelve years. The company currently pays investors $0.24 per share, with a dividend yield just above the 0.5% level. Its stock price rose over 8% in premarket trading to now stand above $180.

Friend Tech Token Tanks After Shambled Debut - The Defiant

Friend Tech copped backlash as many users struggled to claim tokens.The freshly launched and long-awaited FRIEND token is trading at just a $25 million market cap following a launch that left many community members complaining.On May 3, the entire supply of FRIEND became claimable alongside Friend Tech’s v2 iteration. Friend Tech v2 also introduced a native decentralized exchange, BunnySwap, a revamped networking and social platform dubbed Money Club, and a new points system.However, with many users experiencing errors when attempting to claim their tokens, FRIEND being non-transferable except to trade on BunnySwap, and BunnySwap’s liquidity pool reportedly seeded with a single FRIEND token, the project has attracted widespread criticism.“They're likely going to seed with that 1 [FRIEND] and it'll be a madhouse from there,” tweeted 0xBreadguy, a DeFi developer. “Walled garden for degens away from any exchanges, who literally can't interact without having faked being a normal user first. It's on-chain anarchy for the foreseeable future.”“The Friend Tech claim is cooked because the app is generating the wrong proofs,” said 0x5f_eth of Ethos Network. “Doesn’t seem like everyone has the issue.”“For [Friend Tech co-founder] Racer’s final act, he’s enabled the ability for users to watch the price of $FRIEND free fall on the app without being able to load their wallet balance or claim their tokens,” said SplitCapital, a crypto analyst.Steep price declineAccording to CoinGecko, FRIEND crashed 67% over three hours to a low of $0.89 after debuting at $3.26. However, price data from DexScreener shows roughly twice as much chronological price action, including a brief spike to roughly $170 that reversed over 15 minutes.The token has since posted a sharp bounce from its low to change hands at $1.57, still equating to a meager market cap of $25.3 million.FRIEND/WETH price chart. Source: DexScreener.Luke Martin, the host of the Stacks Podcast, said they were stuck watching the value of their airdrop allocation fall from seven figures in value to five figures over two hours while unsuccessfully attempting to claim.Martin also flagged one of Friend Tech’s larger farmers unloading six figures worth of FRIEND immediately after claiming. “This was the largest sybil on Friend Tech dumping all his points in one clip,” Martin said.Fall from graceFriend Tech burst onto the burgeoning SocialFi scene in August 2023. The platform allows users to buy and trade “keys” allowing access to chatrooms associated with Twitter accounts.With prominent crypto analysts promising keyholders access to exclusive tips and alpha while also earning a 5% fee on key trades, Friend Tech rapidly emerged as a booming web3 platform.Friend Tech also earns a 5% fee on key sales, driving $1 million in daily revenue as volume peaked above $20 million in September, according to Dune Analytics. However, activity on the platform has since collapsed, with volume slumping to an all-time low below $60,000 on March 2.Data from Dune Analytics also shows daily users dipping below 1,000 in April, marking a pullback of more than 99% from its October high of nearly 74,000.

However, less than 1,500 users drove under $410,000 worth of trades daily during the final week of April as activity dried up again.According to 0xBreadGuy, Friend Tech will earn a 1.5% fee on Money Clubs, a 1.5% fee on Bunnyswap trades, and 5% on Friend Tech key swaps from its v2 iteration.Friend Tech creators will also continue to take a 5% fee on key swap, and share of referral fees. Liquidity providers will also earn a 1.5% fee on trades.

Bitcoin Price (BTC) Rises Above $60K After Jobs Miss

Interest rates and the U.S. dollar have both risen strongly in 2024, particularly over the past few weeks, as market expectations of a slowing in economic growth and inflation have failed to pan out. Four months ago, a series of five or six 2024 interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve had been priced into forward markets, but, prior today, that was whittled down to one or two, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

BTC price targets with a Bitcoin short squeeze incoming


Bitcoin (BTC) drastically crashed this week, revisiting levels of over two months ago and affecting the cryptocurrency market‘s sentiment. In a dominating bearish market, traders started favoring short positions, which can lead to short squeezes in the following weeks.
Notably, long-position traders lost $400 million in liquidations during the crash, as fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) took over. This long squeeze rebalanced Bitcoin’s derivatives market, clearing most of the opened long positions.
As a result, the market’s open interest (OI) has weighted toward shorts, reaching record negative funding rates year-to-date. Finbold retrieved data from CoinGlass on March 3 showing BTC’s OI-weighted funding rate at its worst levels of 2024.


Essentially, negative funding rates mean Bitcoin short-sellers have to pay interest to long-position traders as they hold their positions. This is a mechanism created to keep the open interest balanced among longs and shorts even during high volatility events.

Bitcoin short squeeze and likely price targets
As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading below the key resistance level of $60,000 per coin. This level is important from both a psychological and technical analysis perspective, considering it has been strong support since March.
Therefore, breaking out from the $60,000 could lead to a sentiment shift to the ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO). Thus, triggering two potential short-squeeze events as massive collateral liquidity pools can become BTC price targets for market makers.
In particular, Bitcoin has over $1.72 billion worth of short-seller liquidations at $71,715. However, CoinGlass’s 1-month heatmap also shows significant liquidity at $67,420 and smaller pools around both key zones.
A short squeeze could reward Bitcoin traders with gains of 14% and 21% from the $59,200 at press time to the first and second liquidation levels, respectively.
BTC Liquidation Heatmap, 1-month chart. Source: CoinGlass
Despite the optimistic outlook for a potential short squeeze and over 14% gains, investors must remain cautious with Bitcoin trading. This is due to macroeconomic concerns related to the Fed’s interest rates and microeconomic concerns related to Bitcoin miners’ revenue drop, which affects network security.
In this context, investment experts from the renowned bank Standard Chartered foresee BTC reaching between $52,000 and $50,000 in the short term.
Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies, including BTC, have high volatility and are hard to forecast further performance.

BREAKING: US Non-Farm Employment Data Announced! What Was Bitcoin's Initial Reaction? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, approached $ 60,000 while trying to recover after the sharp declines it experienced.
While Bitcoin is currently at $59,000, some analysts warn investors that the decline may continue.


While various factors such as the decline in spot Bitcoin ETFs and the decrease in the possibility of a FED interest rate cut were effective in this decline, all eyes on BTC and altcoins today turned to the economic data from the USA.
The data announced on the first Friday of each month is closely followed by investors and stakeholders to understand the state of the economy.





The data disclosed is as follows:
Non-agricultural employment Data: Announced 175k – Expected 238k – Previous 303k


Unemployment data: Announced 3.9% – Expected 3.8% – Previous 3.8%
Bitcoin's reaction after the incoming data was as follows:






Effect of Non-Farm Employment and Unemployment Data on Price!
Non-agricultural employment data coming in above expectations is considered a signal of economic recovery in that country and has a positive impact on the currency.
Changes in the labor market have a significant impact on the FED's monetary policy. The FED, which thinks that the labor market should cool down in addition to the decrease in inflation, follows employment data closely.
If the announced data exceeds expectations, we can see that DXY (dollar index) rises and Bitcoin retreats slightly. If it comes below expectations, it may cause us to see a retreat in DXY.

The increase in the unemployment rate may cause us to see a sharp retreat in DXY. This will also be positive for Bitcoin.

MoonPay Enables Crypto Purchases via PayPal


							

MoonPay partners with PayPal to facilitate crypto transactions for U.S. users.



Users can buy cryptocurrencies through MoonPay using PayPal accounts.



PayPal provides an added layer of security.




MoonPay has taken a positive step in its cryptocurrency services, partnering with PayPal to facilitate crypto-fiat transactions for U.S. residents. With this integration, US-based users of the FinTech app can purchase cryptocurrency through PayPal.



MoonPay disclosed this news on its X account, saying, “Today, we’re thrilled to announce a game-changing integration: MoonPay has partnered with @PayPal to offer seamless fiat-to-crypto transactions for users in the U.S.!”



In a separate post on its website, MoonPay stated that this collaboration will allow U.S. customers to buy digital assets using their existing PayPal accounts. In addition, they can automatically initiate direct bank withdrawals or use a debit card, making the transaction process simpler.



Moreover, PayPal provides an added layer of security, meaning users can conduct cryptocurrency transactions without sharing complete financial information.



Ivan Soto-Wright, co-founder and CEO of MoonPay, commented on this development, noting that “PayPal has always been at the forefront of revolutionizing commerce globally.” 



Soto-Wright highlighted that users are exploring alternative “financial systems.” Hence, this partnership reflects the company’s goal of offering consumers access to several options, including cryptocurrency. 









He added, “By integrating PayPal, we are enabling consumers to transact with crypto in an already familiar environment and significantly lower the barrier to entry for new users.” In essence, this partnership represents a move to streamline cryptocurrency transactions and make them more accessible to a broader audience of users.



Through this integration, PayPal’s extensive user base, exceeding 426 million globally, gains access to crypto purchases. On the other hand, MoonPay, which offers crypto-based services to an established user base of over 15 million, stands to benefit from the expanded reach facilitated by PayPal’s platform.



Furthermore, this initiative is strategic for both entities as it enables PayPal to further diversify its offerings and explore new avenues within the digital asset sector. Simultaneously, it strengthens MoonPay’s position as a leading provider of accessible crypto-purchasing solutions, particularly within the U.S. market.

Ripple Counters SEC’s Opposition Brief With New Filing, What Does It Say? | Bitcoinist.com


								Ripple has filed a new court document supporting its motion to strike new evidence in its long-running legal battle against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The crypto firm filed the initial motion on April 22, seeking to strike Andrea Fox, an accountant at the Commission, as one of the claimant’s witnesses. 
Ripple Makes A Case For Its Latest Request
In the letter addressed to Judge Sarah Netburn, Ripple argued that the SEC has failed to show that Andrea Fox’s declaration is “summary evidence rather than expert testimony or that it was under the court’s scheduling order.” In line with this, they requested that her testimony be struck out. 

Ripple initially raised this motion in opposition to the SEC’s motion for remedies and entry of final judgment. They argued that the SEC erred in relying on Fox’s testimony, as she was never disclosed as a fact or expert witness and was not deposed during the initial discovery or supplemental remedies discovery.
In reply to Ripple’s initial motion, the SEC tried to paint Fox as a summary witness rather than an expert witness, which Ripple had classified her testimony as. The Commission argued that “Ripple incorrectly claims this declaration constitutes expert testimony.” It further stated that this wasn’t the case, claiming that Fox’s declaration was a “standard summary evidence permissible” under the law. 
This was what made Ripple pivot in its latest court filing. It argued that even if Fox was a summary witness (and not an expert witness, as believed), the SEC hasn’t done enough to prove this. The crypto firm noted that the Commission has also failed to explain why Fox’s declaration highlighted her qualification as an accountant if they weren’t trying to paint her as an expert witness. 
Usually, a witness’s qualification would only matter if the witness in question was meant to give expert testimony. As such, although the SEC argues that Fox isn’t, everything points to her being an expert rather than a summary witness. 
Another Argument On Why Fox Is An Expert Witness
In its reply, the SEC claimed that Fox was a summary witness because her declaration only applied “basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records.” However, Ripple refuted this argument, noting that Fox’s actions suggested she was acting as an expert witness. They stated how the accountant used her specialized knowledge to analyze not only Ripple’s records but also third-party evidence and expert reports. 

She then used her analysis to draw inferences and conclusions about the documents she reviewed. Ripple also claimed that she calculated the disgorgement, prejudgement interest, and discount amounts based on her analysis. Basically, the crypto firm was hinting at the fact that the SEC stipulated its proposed fine of almost $2 billion based on Fox’s judgment.
Ripple also alluded to how the SEC had cited one of Fox’s inferences in its remedies memorandum. According to the crypto firm, “a layperson could not “infer” what entries “appear to” mean by doing basic math.”

Turbos Finance pioneers new liquidity strategies for Sui


Turbos Finance, a decentralized exchange (DEX), has unveiled two market-first liquidity strategies within the Sui (SUI) ecosystem, according to the information shared with Finbold on May 2.
The new strategies aim to revolutionize automated liquidity management and simplify liquidity provision.
Turbos Finance’s liquidity strategies
The first strategy is a network-centric automated liquidity management vault for CLMM positions on the Turbos DEX within the Sui network. 


The second is an innovative Auto-swap capability combined with Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategies meant to simplify liquidity provision.
With these automated rebalance vaults, liquidity providers (LPs) can increase their returns with less effort. 
On the other hand, retail investors and professional strategy managers will also be able to optimize their strategies and LP yield.
The Isolated Position Model
Turbos’ key innovations in automated rebalance vaults include the Isolated Position Model (IPM).
Different from the traditional share pool model, IPM offers individual fund management for LPs, utilizing Sui’s exceptional gas efficiency and scalability and setting a new decentralized finance (DeFi) benchmark for asset management.
Additionally, the introduction of Auto-compound Fee and Rewards will make it easier to form LP pairs by allowing single-token deposits for automatic pairing. 
This new feature is set to attract more users, improve Total Value Locked (TVL), increase network activity, and introduce systematic investment via DCA LP functionalities.
To further incentivize and reward active users, Turbos will introduce a referral program offering fee waivers.
New Sui data models
Ted Shao, Co-founder of Turbos Finance, commented on the partnership, stating:

“Our rebalance vault leverages the unique capabilities of Sui to transform user interaction with DeFi. Users precisely manage their assets individually, adapting to market shifts with real-time, high-frequency adjustments. Our vault simplifies asset management through rebalancing and compounding to maximize returns with minimal effort.”

Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-founder and Chief Product Officer (CPO) at Mysten Labs, the investors in Turbos Finance, echoed Shao’s sentiment, expressing excitement about the innovative digital asset management strategies introduced.
Abiodun emphasized the exciting opportunities provided by new data models, as well as the exceptional gas efficiency and scalable architecture of the Sui platform.
The new liquidity strategies will be implemented on May 3, with ongoing updates and optimizations planned to enhance efficiency and user experience. 
The launch of DCA strategies is scheduled for Q3.

Yesterday at Microstrategy World: Bitcoin for corporations, Michael Saylor had multiple strong positive remarks on Bitcoin and its network. Saylor, categorically said Bitcoin is the best Cryptocurrency Network and not just the best crypto asset. Simply put, there is no second best to Bitcoin. His words.Video Courtesy of MicroStrategy. According to Michael Saylor, Bitcoin is the best treasury asset since it is able to provide accretion, unlike the US dollar which creates dilution. Bitcoin, according to MicroStrategy’s Executive Chairman, provides the most ideal alternative investment, which has absolutely no correlation to state-owned currencies and no affiliations to corporations. The man certainly holds Bitcoin in high regard, claiming that Bitcoin is the best bank and path to peace and prosperity. He does not see Bitcoin as a single product, instead, Bitcoin is a full-fledged ecosystem of products, securities, companies, derivatives, and even professions. In his presentation, he mentioned there are up to 220 million Bitcoin holders globally and the robust network certainly provides the most secure crypto network. Currently there are approximately 420 million crypto users today. According to Michael Saylor, all Altcoins are facing major regulatory issues, competing against one another, attempting to tread new waters, and getting hacked among others. These challenges, eventually could blow up and all the liquidity from these ecosystems would flow right into Bitcoin, why? -you guessed it, the best crypto network with 100% acceptance. Michael Saylor says Bitcoin is the most widely bought investment asset in the world and he makes incredibly good points to back this case.

The best.”The MicroStrategy Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor.According to him the digital transformation of capital can improve several aspects of our life. In fact, he mentions that digital transformation, although isn’t a solution to all world problems, it is indeed a solution to half of the problems in the world. In his closing remarks, Saylor urged attendees to Study, Buy, Hold, Build on, Advocate for, Defend, and Enjoy Bitcoin.

The Rise of DeFi Lending: How ZeroLend is Transforming the space



                    

If you’ve ever gone through the process of applying for a loan through traditional banking, you know it can be quite cumbersome. Traditionally, securing a loan meant dealing with a maze of paperwork, credit checks, and lengthy approval procedures. However, DeFi lending changes this narrative entirely. Now, borrowers can utilize their crypto assets as collateral, instantly accessing funds through smart contracts seamlessly integrated into blockchain networks. This is the reality of DeFi lending, a sector that is witnessing rapid growth, with an astonishing $24.62 billion locked in smart contracts.



Amidst the booming DeFi lending market, ZeroLend stands out with its unique features. Let’s delve into how this platform is revolutionizing the way you can securely and smoothly avail credit.

With an estimated 15-17% of the total supply allocated for community airdrops, ZeroLend demonstrates its commitment to inclusivity and community engagement.



Leading the DeFi Revolution



ZeroLend’s exponential growth positions it as a formidable contender in the lending space, rapidly ascending the ranks to become one of the top 10 lending protocols alongside industry stalwarts like Aave, Compound, and Spark. With a remarkable $200 million growth in Total Value Locked (TVL) in 2024, ZeroLend sets its sights on revolutionizing DeFi lending and simplifying it for the retail audience.




ZeroLend’s Innovations in DeFi Lending



Curve-like Tokenomics

Immutable (IMX) Faces Token Unlock, Will the Market Absorb Potential Selling? | Cryptopolitan

Tokens have been locked up for years for many high-profile projects. To protect investors and prove transparency, many projects store some of those tokens in a preset smart contract, to be unlocked at a certain date. Some of the most significant unlocking programs belonged to Ripple, where each month the market waited to see if the new unlocked batch would be sold. A new token unlock is coming up this week for Immutable (IMX), one of the high-profile L2 networks. Immutable will increase its free float with up to 2%, after a new batch of tokens gets unlocked on May 6.As of May 2024, Immutable has unlocked more than 65.51% of all locked tokens. The current unlock is valued at $1.57M, and represents 1.93% of the free float. From this moment onward, the unlocks will accelerate even more, increasing the supply of IMX. The market trades around 2.46% of the available supply, which may put pressure on the IMX market price.IMX Tokens Hold Relatively Low LiquidityDays before the unlock, IMX traded at $2.21, while trading volumes were around $70M in 24 hours. But this activity comes with thin availability of buyers. The 2% slippage liquidity for IMX is just around $152K, just a fraction of the size of the upcoming token unlock. IMX is sinking from its recent short-term peak above $3.60, but remains a bit more active after several years of stagnation. The most new IMX comes from rewards for ecosystem development. IMX is also eligible for staking programs, as well as special quests. The Immutable community can now receive daily Gem rewards for bridging IMX tokens. Over time, IMX holders will receive more IMX into their balance, especially for swapping and bridging quests. The Immutable project has a long-term view of developing its ecosystem. Still, in the coming months, there will be more IMX available, and it will either be used in incentivized programs, or deflate the market in case of direct selling. Immutable Brings Gems Holding ProgramImmutable offers incentives to hold onto IMX tokens and receive future rewards. Currently, the daily quests offered require users to just hold a balance of at least 20 IMX and collect three Gems daily. The more Gems accrued, the more future rewards and bonuses will come to the player. Gems will then serve to put the player in a higher tier for future IMX airdrops or additional rewards, access or exclusive deals. With this move, IMX has turned into a point-farming protocol, aiming to protect its main token from selling. Immutable Aims to Jump-Start Web3 RecoveryImmutable has grown a significant ecosystem of games, including high-profile projects like Illuvium, or upcoming ones like Wagmi Game. But players may need a bit more to regain their enthusiasm for Web3 gaming. To that goal, Immutable brings incentives with a value of $50M to boost participation in its portfolio of games. Part of the rewards will also go to the holders of collectibles and NFT. Immutable has been a driver of NFT creation and trading, targeting high-profile projects as a partner.More High-Profile Token Unlocks Coming in the Next MonthIn the next month, several projects will expand their free float. Token unlocks are coming from Arbitrum (ARB), with a value of nearly $9M. ApeCoin (APE) will inject $8.89M worth of tokens. Optimism (OP) will also grow its circulation with an additional 1.15%, after spending years as a tokenless project.A more significant unlock is expected from Sui Foundation (SUI), which will release around 20% of its supply. The new tokens are valued at $189M based on current market prices. Sui is one of the projects with a complex program of locked tokens. On May 31, additional data show several tiers of token owners will have their assets unlocked. Nearly 1B SUI tokens will potentially enter the market from that date onward. In the long term, some of the remaining SUI tokens will remain locked until after 2030. Over the years, Sui will also accelerate the unlocking of vaults, in a series of events of both gradual increases and “cliff unlocks” that will inflate the supply more significantly.

Tap Into the Most Lucrative ETH to USDT Exchange with the Lowest Fees Today



                    

Swapping ETH to USDT has become a staple transaction in cryptocurrency, offering swift and strategic benefits for savvy investors and active traders. These enthusiasts often capitalize on this famous trading pair, emphasizing the importance of securing a profitable exchange rate and low-to-zero transaction fees. Today, we invite you to explore CrowdSwap, a standout platform that promises enhanced financial opportunities and prioritizes your trading efficiency. Discover why CrowdSwap could be your go-to choice for making the most of your cryptocurrency transactions.



Tether, also called USDT, is a stablecoin directly pegged to the US dollar, providing a buffer against the often severe price movements every day in cryptocurrencies such as ETH. In the frequently turbulent realm of cryptocurrency trading, stablecoins such as Tether play a crucial role. USDT emerged as the foremost stablecoin, enjoying significant trading volume and widespread recognition. Amidst the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency commerce spaces, Tether, valued in the billions, presents itself as a steadfast and reliable option. To shield their profits and mitigate potential losses, traders and investors frequently opt to convert their assets into USDT, underscoring its esteemed position within the trading community.




In contrast, Ethereum (ETH) ranks just below Bitcoin in terms of commerce funding and general popularity. Its versatility and extensive range of applications have garnered significant esteem within the cryptocurrency community, prompting numerous individuals to either buy or exchange their tokens for ETH. ETH holds value for investment and trading purposes, and its diverse advantages within the Ethereum ecosystem. However, as previously noted, there are instances where investors may find it prudent to convert their ETH holdings into more stable assets like USDT.



Diving deep into CrowdSwap’s Ethereum to Tether exchange



Developed in Germany in 2020, this decentralized platform is dedicated to cryptocurrency trading and generating passive income. CrowdSwap is expertly crafted for quick and easy cross-chain swaps, requiring only a few clicks for operation.

All transaction fees are presented upfront, with absolutely no hidden costs.



The exchange’s trade tracking system further enhances its user-friendliness, allowing you to effortlessly track transaction status, review all your activities, and employ advanced filtering options not commonly available on other exchanges.




Lightning-fast cross-chain substitutes



With CrowdSwap, cross-chain transactions and fast, secure substitution are made possible, and token movement between several blockchain networks is easy. Take advantage of unrestricted bridging, trading, and infinite substitution of any token between chains.



Limit orders across chains



You can improve your commerce approach and exclude potential risks using CrowdSwap’s limit orders system. With it, you can set limit orders across various blockchains, altogether avoiding the once-necessary bridge between chain structures, thus reducing the risk of exposure. The feature allows users to determine the exact amount of coins and the value they want to purchase or trade them. Then, these orders are put on hold until the broader market sentiment meets the user’s wants, detailed in the limit order. By leveraging this functionality, you can entirely protect your investments or sidestep commerce volatility.



How CrowdSwap revolutionized the Ethereum to Tether landscape



As you may have noticed, CrowdSwap offers a highly efficient and cost-effective solution for exchanging Ethereum (ETH) for Tether (USDT). By leveraging advanced technology to minimize transaction fees and optimize trading routes, this promising company ensures a seamless exchange experience and maximizes user value. This platform is ideal for individuals who manage their cryptocurrency investments smartly, providing a reliable tool for those seeking to transition between ETH and USDT with minimal cost and maximum efficiency.



CrowdSwap is actively taking its place as the spearheader of the current cryptocurrency community. With the launch of the first decentralized ETF, it quickly set itself apart from the competition. On top of that, the variety of decentralized and general swap infrastructures it offers to its clients is immensely comprehensive and deserves praise.




The ETF is a promising new venture within the larger cryptocurrency market. We suggest all our readers keep a close eye on this platform’s future innovations and expansions, as it might spell a lucrative opportunity in the coming years.



CrowdSwap demonstrates a commendable approach to cryptocurrency exchanges. However, to truly appreciate the innovation and efficiency it brings to the table, visit the platform directly, explore its services, and experience the benefits yourself.

Arweave (AR) Rallies on New Futures Market Launch, Network Marks Transaction Record | Cryptopolitan

Arweave (AR) recovered strongly to $35, remaining close to its weekly peak. Arweave is part of the new batch of projects that started trading in 2021, and is yet to recover the all-time high of above $80 achieved during the 2021-2022 bull market.AR traded at $35.07 with volumes close to $200M in 24 hours and $355K in liquidity for 2% slippage. AR remains in the green on the weekly chart, as the project entered the top 50 of coins based on market capitalization. AR is also an outlier among tokens, for having 99% of its supply in circulation, with no locked coins or vaults. Additionally, around 8% of all tokens are actively traded in a 24-hour period. AR retains mid-range liquidity in its most active trading pairs on Binance.The immediate reason for the AR rally was a recent listing on the Coinbase futures market, along with Hedera and Theta Network. The full effect of futures trading is yet to be seen, as the new markets will open from May 9.Arweave Marks Transaction Peak in AprilThe Arweave ecosystem aims to build the decentralized ledger for data storage and retrieval. Arweave protocol has been tested for years now, and has proven robust as a tool for permanent data storage. A distributed system aims to disrupt existing cloud solutions, with the potential to create truly neutral web apps and storage that does not expire due to time constraints. Increased usage also translates into demand for AR tokens, as they are the main currency to pay for storage. Over the past few months, Arweave noted increased data inflows and transactions on its specialized blockchain.Arweave is now in the most active stage of building up its ecosystem and social media community. An expanding token is only helping to retain new supporters. The Arweave community have picked the Weavers nickname. Arweave is now trying to retain users by also offering gamified bounties. Arweave Moves to Decentralized ComputingArweave is also targeting developers directly, with the potential to build decentralized applications. The platform has carried distributed data solutions for a total of six years, while expanding beyond storage and into distributed computing. With the new addition of AO Computer, Arweave turns similar to projects like the Internet Computer.The Arweave services are available for end users, but also as enterprise solutions. Distributed data and computation was also implemented by other blockchain projects, showing that Arweave is compatible with all types of data needs.On Arweave’s distributed storage, the platform brings a more accessible way of interacting with blockchain records. Over the years, blockchains become too large and only dedicated entities try to hold the entire history. Arweave aims to prevent that data overload, by incentivizing distributed storage and retrieval of the blockchain history.Arweave also branched into the AO Computer project, which positions itself as a hub for developers. In general, Arweave aims to add new activities and branches, becoming a multi-product hub. Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are also one of the targets for Arweave. In the coming months, Arweave may also add faster forms of swapping and DeFi capabilities. But the key project remains the AO computer, which will aim to transfer fast messages for decentralized Internet services. AO Computer is still in the testnet stage, but Arweave hopes to repeat the success of its decentralized data network. In the coming months, the AO evolution from test net to official launch may continue to drive attention for Arweave, as well as the AR token. The launch of the AO test net was among the big events for Arweave, which caused a 40% token rally in February. Arweave Uses Data-Based Mining ProtocolArweave uses a process of mining, where each node has to prove they have stored as much data as possible. The Arweave protocol checks randomly for a selected piece of data. Miners receive rewards if they have that data in storage and available for retrieval. Mining with proof of data storage is possible even for consumer-grade electronics. There are also other roles for securing the blockchain, such as observer nodes. All network participants will receive incentive IO tokens for securing the project’s distributed services.

Kraken’s Indices Unit Claims 50% of Crypto Benchmarking Market - DailyCoin


        
One of Kraken’s crypto units has achieved a key milestone.



The unit is a beneficiary of the spot Bitcoin ETF boom in the U.S.



The unit now controls a significant share of the crypto benchmarking market.
Kraken’s indices provider CF Benchmarks has tapped the spot Bitcoin ETF boom to control a significant share of the crypto benchmarking market, the company said Friday.Founded in 2017 and acquired by Kraken in 2019, CF Benchmarks has established itself as a leading digital asset index provider authorized by the UK’s FCA. The company has partnerships with notable industry heavyweights, including Nomura, Hashdex, and Custodia.CF Benchmarks Dominates Crypto BenchmarkingIn a Bloomberg report dated May 3, CF Benchmarks claimed that it represented “roughly half the crypto benchmarking market” following this year’s boom in U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
The company said it provides reference data for about $24 billion in cryptocurrency ETFs, mostly the new fleet of Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin funds, including BlackRock’s $15 billion IBIT. CF Benchmarks licenses its benchmarks to these funds in exchange for fees that rise in tandem with assets under management (AUM).Per the report, the company anticipated $5 billion of assets this year for the U.S. Bitcoin ETFs that use its indices but the amount has exceeded this projection by four times, providing more opportunities for CF Benchmarks.Looking ahead, CF Benchmarks is keen on tapping the new Hong Kong crypto ETF market.
“South Korea is a market where ETFs have become the wrapper of choice for long-term savings,” CF Benchmarks CEO Sui Chung stated. “It is also a market where digital assets have gained a high degree of adoption.”Besides forecasting as much as $1 billion in AUM for the Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ether funds, Chung sees crypto ETFs reaching Israel and South Korea next.  Read about BTCC’s massive crypto trading competition:BTCC Sets 10M USDT Rewards for Its World Trading ContestStay updated on Binance’s collaboration with India to nab a multimillion-dollar scam:Binance Collaborates with Indian Authorities to Nab $10M Scam

Homo Pepe (HOMPEPE), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK).




Early investors in SHIB and BONK made astronomical returns, and Homo Pepe presents a similar opportunity.



Homo Pepe has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 5,300% in the coming two days, and Homo Pepe could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Homo Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Homo Pepe on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Pepe by entering its contract address – HmnxTLpi2QYp9LCB1p8yFgR3X5xqVmE4eAnWU4xMYGe1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, BONK and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMPEPE.

Bullish: Shiba Inu whale stacks $40 million in SHIB


Observing the movements of smart whales can provide valuable insights for crypto traders and investors navigating the waters of cryptocurrency. These highly capitalized addresses have a profitable trading history.
On May 1, an anonymous wallet executed a major transaction on the Robinhood exchange, acquiring 1.75 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens, valued at approximately $40 million.
The data from Whale Alert shows that this substantial acquisition involved two separate transfers, each moving 875 billion SHIB in under a minute.




The massive transactions occurred from Robinhood to the wallet address ‘0x73AF3bcf944a6559933396c1577B257e2054D935. 
According to Etherscan data, this wallet has previously moved SHIB to and from Robinhood as well. Over the past month, this address has engaged significantly in the SHIB market with high-volume transactions. 
Notably, it transferred 3 trillion SHIB into Robinhood on April 24, showcasing a pattern of regular inflows and outflows with the platform. This behavior underscores its considerable influence in the market, with the wallet currently holding over 5.88 trillion SHIB, valued at approximately $128 million.
Market impact and predictions
Professional crypto trader Ali Martinez mentioned in a post on X (formerly Twitter) recently that Shiba Inu appears to be forming a bull flag on its daily chart. A bull flag is a bullish pattern, suggesting that the crypto asset is poised for further upward movement. Anticipating this, the crypto analyst revealed that he is placing buy orders around $0.000018343, aiming for a bullish breakout that could propel Shiba Inu’s price to $0.000072323.

Despite the market’s recent dips, the trading volume and wallet activities suggest continuous interest in Shiba Inu tokens, highlighting the volatile yet intriguing nature of cryptocurrency investments. 
According to data from Coinmarketcap, the Shiba Inu daily trading volume has risen approximately 40%. This surge is driven mostly by the Binance crypto exchange, whose Japanese arm announced a number of sought-after trading pairs, including SHIB.

As of press time, Shiba Inu was changing hands at a price of $0.00002363, recording an increase of 3.18% in the last 24 hours. The current market activity surrounding Shiba Inu reflects a vibrant and dynamic market. Observations and analyses provided by market experts suggest a bullish outlook for SHIB, making it a noteworthy consideration for investors looking for exposure in the cryptocurrency space.
As the market continues to evolve, it will be crucial for investors and analysts alike to stay informed of such trends and movements to optimize their strategies in the ever-changing landscape of digital assets.

Bitcoin Billionaire Arthur Hayes Predicts Market Bottom Is In, 'Slow Grind Higher' - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsWhen the Bitcoin price tanks, traders tend to take cover and look for signs that the market has reached bottom and will reverse its trajectory.To that end, Bitcoin billionaire and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes has some cautious optimism to share. "While I don’t expect crypto to fully realize the recent U.S. monetary announcements’ inflationary nature immediately," he wrote in a blog post, "I expect prices to bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher."In other words, he thinks that the worst is over—for now.Earlier this week, Bitcoin crashed below $57,000 ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting. But when Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that interest rates would again remain unchanged—which many investors were expecting—prices traded sideways.At the time of writing, Bitcoin has reclaimed $61,000 for the first time since the end of April, having gained 4.6% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.While Hayes predicts that the bottom is in for Bitcoin, his strategy does not include adding to his BTC bags."I certainly won’t be babysitting Bitcoin when I could be two-stepping," he wrote, adding that, "The recent intense puke out provides an excellent opportunity to unstake my USDe and spend synthetic dollars on high beta shitcoins. I’m buying Solana and doggie coins for momentum trading positions."The good news, he said, is that recent developments at the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve, and the recent bailout of Republic First Bank are all indicators that dollar liquidity will start to increase. It was only just a month ago—ahead of the most recent Bitcoin halving—that Hayes was bearish on prices because of dwindling dollar liquidity.One of the main macroeconomic indicators he highlight was the Federal Reserve preparing to borrow more money between now and the end of June—approximately $41 billion than previously announced in January."That’s no bueno if you are a holder of Treasuries," Hayes explained, saying that this will bump up the supply of Treasury bonds. That, he said, will likely increase long-term bond rates."Yellen’s response to that will be some form of yield curve control," he wrote in the blog post, "and that’s when Bitcoin begins its ascent for realz to $1 million."Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Why This Crypto Bull Run Might Not Live Up To The Past: Analyst


                            In a detailed analysis shared with his 788,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), renowned analyst Pentoshi has forecasted a more restrained outlook for the current crypto bull run, suggesting that it may not mirror the explosive growth seen in previous cycles. His insights provide a deep dive into the underlying factors that could temper the market’s performance.
Why Crypto Investors Have To Expect Diminishing Returns
Pentoshi began his analysis by stating, “This cycle should have the largest diminishing returns of any cycle,” attributing this prediction to several key market conditions. Primarily, he noted that the base market capitalization for cryptocurrencies has increased significantly in each successive cycle, setting a higher starting point that makes further exponential growth increasingly challenging.
“Each cycle has set a floor about 10x the previous lows in terms of market cap,” Pentoshi explained. He provided a historical context, recounting that when he entered the crypto market in 2017, the market cap for altcoins was only around $12-15 billion, a figure that ballooned to over $1 trillion during peak periods. He argued, “That growth isn’t repeatable,” pointing out that the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which was then nascent, played a significant role in driving previous cycles’ exceptional returns.

Another significant factor Pentoshi highlighted is the dramatic increase in the number of altcoins and the corresponding market dilution. “Today, however, there are a lot more alts, and a lot more dilution,” he remarked, indicating that the proliferation of new tokens spreads investment thinner across the market, reducing the potential for individual tokens to achieve substantial price increases.
Pentoshi also touched upon the demographic shifts in crypto ownership. He contrasted the early days of crypto adoption, when approximately 2% of Americans were involved in the market, to the present, where over 25% of Americans have some form of crypto investment. “It just requires more capital to move the markets, and there will continue to be a lot more alts, spreading it out further,” he noted, emphasizing the logistical and financial challenges of replicating past growth rates in a much more saturated market.
An often-overlooked aspect of market dynamics, according to Pentoshi, is the role of token liquidity and its impact on price stability. He detailed that recently, tokens amounting to about $250 million were unlocked daily, though not necessarily sold. “Assuming they all got sold, that is the inflows you’d need just to keep prices stable for 24 hours,” he explained, highlighting the delicate balance required to maintain current market levels, let alone drive prices upward.

Looking forward, Pentoshi was conservative in his expectations for the Total3 index, which tracks the top 125 altcoins (excludes Bitcoin and Ethereum). He estimated, “My best guess is that this cycle we don’t see Total 3 go 2x past the 21′ cycle ATH. So 2.2T max for Total3.” This projection underscores his broader thesis that while the market continues to offer daily opportunities, the era of “easy, outsized gains” might be behind us.
Pentoshi concluded his analysis with advice for investors, suggesting a more cautious approach to market participation. “If you believe the cycle is 50% over, you should be taking out more than you are putting in and building up some cash and buying other assets with lower risk in the meantime,” he advised, stressing the importance of securing gains and diversifying holdings to mitigate risk.
Reflecting on the psychological aspects of investing, he added, “Most people never really learn. Because if you can’t control your greed, and defeat it, you are destined to give back your gains repeatedly.” His parting words were a reminder of the cyclical and often predatory nature of financial markets, urging investors to secure profits and protect themselves from foreseeable downturns.
At press time, TOTAL3 stood at $635.565 billion, which is still more than -43 % below the last cycle high.

Bitcoin Headed For A 'W-Shaped Reversal,' Says Crypto Expert, Who Sees Altseason 'Around The Corner' - Benzinga

Pseudonymous researcher Alex Wacy predicts that Bitcoin BTC/USD has reached its bottom at $52,000, sparking discussions on the cryptocurrency's future.What Happened: In a recent analysis shared on May 2, Wacy observed the crypto community’s focus on the $52,000 level for Bitcoin. He noted increased buyer interest at this level and suggested that every price rise is being viewed as a short entry to $52,000."Everyone is eyeing $52,000, but it’s not feasible to dump the price up just so everyone can buy in," Wacy writes.In an ideal scenario, where Bitcoin’s price would rise to $62,000, retract to just below $56,500, and then rapidly pump to over $70,000, it would mark the start of an altseason. If Wacy’s analysis proves accurate, it could signal a significant shift in the crypto market.Drawing parallels to previous situations when Bitcoin was at $17,000 and $28,000, Wacy predicted a similar outcome. He also suggested that buying altcoins at current levels is not a mistake, indicating an attractive risk-reward ratio for investors looking to diversify their crypto portfolios.Also Read: Is Bitcoin’s Fall Over? Top Crypto Analyst Says ‘Altcoins Are Going To Take Over Until…’Why It Matters: If Wacy’s analysis proves accurate, it could signal a significant shift in the crypto market. The potential W-shaped reversal pattern and the start of an altseason would be a welcome development for investors who have weathered the recent market turbulence.Wacy emphasized the importance of buying Bitcoin in parts rather than trying to catch the bottom, citing personal experience as a lesson. In another tweet, Wacy writes, "It doesn’t matter if it’s $58,000, $52,000, or $43,000, the alt season is just around the corner and top alts that retail understands and generates interest will be pumped."While the accuracy of Wacy’s predictions remains to be seen, his analysis provides a compelling perspective on the potential direction of the crypto market and the opportunities that may arise for both Bitcoin and altcoins.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: What The FOMC Meeting Means For Bitcoin’s Next MoveImage:

How can you own a genuine Banksy? The answer’s on the blockchain - CoinJournal



                    

                    10101.art, a ground-breaking art-tech platform, celebrated its official launch in Dubai’s Monada Art gallery this week.
Bringing the power of the distributed ledger to the global art market, 10101.art leverages blockchain technology to make iconic works by Banksy, Warhol, Picasso, Dali, and others available for collective ownership.
Alina Krot, CEO of 10101.art, sat down to discuss the platform’s launch with Philip Hoey, Director of CoinJournal.

Philip Hoey: Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with CoinJournal, Alina. Let’s kick off with a quick overview of your platform – can you describe the journey that led you and your team to launch 10101.art?
Alina Krot: My journey to the art world was quite long. Even though art has always been my passion, my first career choice was finance. I used to work with high-risk assets and large investment lending projects in a bank before getting into the startup scene. 5 years later I realized that the big corporate world is not for me. In 2019, I got involved in WEB 3. This choice allowed me to dive into the blockchain field and work on several projects, gaining valuable experience.
Eventually, I’d grown to take a product management role. All that experience made me realize that basically any traditional sphere can be made more accessible with blockchain.
The puzzle of financial expertise and art appreciation came together when I met Iryna, founder of 10101.art. I realized that the art market can actually become more inclusive with the power of blockchain. Moreover, I knew I could really contribute to that.
PH: What first sparked your interest in combining physical art with blockchain technology?
AK: I guess it was the realization of the absolute benefits blockchain is able to bring to the art industry. And by that I mean collective ownership and democratization of the art market itself. For a long time art ownership was a privilege of the richer people. Blockchain and collective ownership is making this market accessible for everyone. 
Every year more and more industries, such as real estate, healthcare, finance, etc. have already realized the benefits of blockchain implementation, so I’m pretty sure that a more widespread adoption will bring new disruptive innovations in numerous fields.
PH: NFT enthusiasts will be very familiar with investing in digital assets, but 10101.art is pioneering the use of NFTs for physical artworks. Given that many of these artworks are considered masterpieces and will almost certainly appreciate in value, it seems like this might offer collectors a less risky approach to engaging with art. Would you agree with that?
AK: Absolutely, owning a piece of art on 10101.art is definitely less risky, especially for those familiar with the NFT space. 
First, there are liquidity issues. Traditionally, art can be tough to sell quickly, especially for collectors with little to no experience. With collective ownership through NFTs, individuals are able to trade them on a secondary market.
Another huge advantage is affordability. 10101.art allows people to buy a smaller piece of a valuable artwork. This makes masterpiece ownership much more reachable compared to needing to buy the whole thing at auctions.
There’s also the transparency factor. Blockchain technology provides a clear record of ownership and the artwork’s history, which can be reassuring.

PH: In the past there have been other platforms that have used special purpose vehicles to enable fractional ownership of famous artworks, but leveraging the power of the blockchain seems like a more efficient process than forming a new SPV every time a new artwork is offered for sale. Would you say physical NFTs are the future of fractional ownership in the art world? 
AK: There’s no doubt that traditional collective ownership models, reliant on special purpose vehicles (SPVs), can be inefficient. The need to establish a new SPV for each artwork creates significant administrative burdens. In this regard, physical NFTs, leveraging the power of blockchain technology, offer a compelling alternative.
The efficiency gains associated with NFTs are undeniable. By eliminating the requirement for bespoke SPVs, co-ownership becomes streamlined. Additionally, the inherent transparency and security of blockchain facilitates seamless transactions and clear ownership tracking.
Furthermore, physical NFTs democratize access to the art world. By tokenizing high-value artworks, individuals who might not possess the resources to acquire a masterpiece outright can still participate in the art market.
PH: Which blockchain does 10101.art use?
AK: Currently our platform operates on Ethereum blockchain. But we also plan to launch some collections using other new EVM-compatible blockchains in the near future.
PH: Can you explain the tokenization process?
AK: Of course. The tokenization process on 10101.art is divided into four major stages.
The process begins with a dedicated team scouring valuable collections, auction houses, and galleries. Authenticity is paramount, so each piece undergoes careful examination before being considered.
Once an artwork is selected, our development team scans and uploads it for safekeeping on a secure, decentralized system. This ensures the digital record remains tamper-proof and readily accessible. Here’s where the magic of blockchain comes in: using smart contracts, we split ownership of an artwork into tokens. These contracts clearly define the total number of tokens available and their initial value, providing complete transparency. All ownership rights over a particular painting are specified in the documents defining co-ownership, published on our website.
Eventually, individuals become co-owners of a renowned artwork. By purchasing a token, they don’t just acquire a digital image. They gain a verifiable stake in the physical piece itself, stored at our partner gallery, Monada Art.

PH: How many fragments is each individual artwork divided into, and is there a limit to how many tokens an individual art collector can buy for that artwork?
AK: The amount of fragments depends on the artwork itself. For example, so far there are 1500 pieces of Banksy’s “Turf War” and 1200 of Warhol’s “Campbell’s Soup Cans” in total available on 10101.art. However, there’s no actual limit.
PH: Do 10101.art users use crypto to buy these artworks, or can they also use fiat?
AK: Our team is currently working on that matter. So, the only thing I can say is stay tuned for the updates on our social media! We’ll announce the start of fiat payments soon.
PH: If an enthusiast wants to buy a whole artwork on 10101.art is that possible?
AK: It is possible, although it’s an individual procedure. If you’re interested in buying a whole artwork, feel free to contact us and we’ll figure it out.
PH: What happens if all of the tokens for a particular artwork aren’t sold?
AK: If a painting is not completely sold within the allotted time, all issued NFTs are burned, and the refund option becomes available to users.

PH: Do art collectors receive proof of ownership when they buy an artwork piece on 10101.art?
AK: Of course. NFTs act as digital proof of ownership for the portion of the artwork purchased. They reside on a blockchain which tracks ownership and verifies its authenticity. Additionally, new artworks owners also receive a physical certificate of ownership upon purchase. 
PH: How do you decide which artworks to list on 10101.art?
AK: Our goal is to provide people with the most promising pieces possible, and to achieve that, we rely on a team of highly respected art experts and dealers from around the world.  They evaluate each artwork meticulously based on a number of key factors.
One of the top priorities is artistic significance. We want to feature works by the most influential artists throughout history, those who have truly shaped the art world.  These could be from any country or era, as long as their artistic impact is undeniable.
Another important factor is recognizability. There’s power in iconic styles. Our experts look for works with a clear artistic identity, pieces that are instantly recognizable by the artist’s signature style. 
Finally, authenticity is absolutely crucial. Our team carefully examines all documentation associated with a piece, including expert reports, certificates of authenticity, and a clear ownership history. This process ensures that the artwork we offer is genuine and has a verifiable past.
PH: When a new artwork is listed on 10101.art, how do you determine its valuation?
AK: We obtain this information from our network of curators and art dealers and align it with our business model, sticking to the principle of making the work accessible to our collectors, while maintaining margins that allow the business to grow.
PH: How do you handle the physical storage and display of those artworks? Are they displayed publicly?
AK: Every artwork presented on 10101.art is stored in Monada Art gallery in Dubai, DIFC. The gallery opened in 2023 and is now our official partner on exclusive terms who shares our vision and mission to make art accessible. 
PH: Can art collectors visit the artworks they have bought to see them in real life?
AK: Yes. Monada Art is open for anyone who wants to see our collection in person and get closer to fine art. Every visitor is welcomed there, so if you’re eager to visit the gallery we offer a tour with our gallery manager Dayana. 
PH: If an art collector wants to sell their NFTs at a later date, will 10101.art eventually offer a secondary market for this?
AK: Yes, we’re working on the development of a secondary platform. We’ll announce its launch soon on our social media. Keep posted!
PH: How has your background in finance influenced your approach to running 10101.art?
AK: My background in finance has been incredibly valuable in building 10101.art.  You might think finance and art are separate worlds, but financial literacy is crucial in the art market as well.
For example, risk management is a core skill in both fields. As an art platform, we need to carefully evaluate artists, artwork provenance, and market trends. This financial lens helps me steer 10101.art towards pieces that hold strong potential for our users.
Strategic thinking is another big one. Finance is all about planning for the long term, and that’s exactly what we’re doing at 10101.art. We’re not just chasing the next hot artist or trend. We’re building a platform that will reshape the art market for years to come. It’s about making high-value art accessible to a wider audience, while creating a new way to own a piece of art. By the way, let’s connect on LinkedIn if this idea resonates with you. 
PH: Can you offer our readers a sneak peek into any well known artworks you hope to list on 10101.art in the future?
AK: Every new artwork in our collection is a valuable masterpiece, so we’re willing to make every new arrival special. We’re ready to surprise you, so stay tuned for the updates!
PH: What are some of the most exciting trends you’re seeing in the art market today?
AK: Real world assets are a huge trend in the art market today. More and more art tokenization platforms, such as 10101.art appear. Even apart from art, lots of other industries started to tokenize physical objects valuable in real life. 
We in 10101.art are not just seeing this exciting trend, we’re leading it with a mission of making fine art more reachable.

Coinbase Q1 Crushes It, But Fickle Crypto Winds Linger - DailyCoin


        
Coinbase reported significantly better than expected Q1 results.



The company acknowledged the importance of revenue diversification.



Next quarter results appear on track.
With inflation remaining stubbornly high and interest rates unchanged since July 2023, modest earnings growth was the general expectation for earnings season. However, Coinbase bucked that trend spectacularly, releasing Q1 2024 numbers that blew Wall Street projections out of the water. The leading US crypto exchange earned $1,638 million in total revenue, trouncing estimates of $1,321 million and soaring 72% higher than the previous quarter. However, a period of recent crypto instability, in which Bitcoin sunk to a 9-week low of $56,600, served as a stark reminder of Coinbase’s precarious business model and its ability to deliver consistent growth and shareholder returns over the long term.Coinbase on a RollIn acknowledgment of its precarious business model, the Risk Factors Summary section of Coinbase’s current 10-Q report stated, “Our total revenue is substantially dependent on the prices of crypto assets and volume of transactions conducted on our platform.” The filing warned that a decline in either metric may negatively impact operations, including the company’s stock price. 
Nonetheless, Coinbase has taken strides to diversify its revenue streams beyond the core exchange trading fees. This quarter, its “Other subscription and services revenue” soared 122% year-over-year to $63,686 million, up from $28,682 million in Q1 2023. Subscriptions offer users benefits like zero fees, higher staking rewards, priority support, and advanced analytics tools.Custodial fee revenue jumped 90% to $32,341 million, compared to $17,043 million a year prior. The increase is largely attributed to Coinbase providing custody services for 90% of the Bitcoin ETFs that launched in the US in Q1.Subscription and services revenue figures per the latest Q-10 reportHowever, concerns continue to swirl around Coinbase’s ability to limit its exposure when the inevitable bear market arrives. Diversification StrategyCoinbase recognized that diversifying and growing its subscription and services revenue is key to mitigating its exposure to crypto price volatility. 
Owen Lau, analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., agreed that adopting a diversification strategy “can provide some downside protection” when cryptocurrency prices and volumes turn bearish.However, investor concerns continue to swirl about the company’s ability to build out these income streams further in the future.Q2 Appears on TrackThe shareholder letter painted an optimistic tone for Q2, stating that transaction revenue in April came in at $300 million, which is around on track to match Q1’s $1,077 million transaction revenue in Q1. However, Coinbase cautioned against projecting future quarterly results based on one month’s actual.The company provided a similarly positive forecast for its subscription and services revenue stream in Q2, estimating it will land between $525-$600 million, subject to crypto prices remaining at levels seen this year. This would approximately match or exceed Q1’s $511 million figure.On the Flipside
Shareholders celebrated the Q1 results as EPS came in at $4.40, smashing expectations of $1.15, and up 323% on Q4 2023.



Coinbase is subject to an SEC complaint which may impact the company‘s financial position going forward.



Before Q4 2023, Coinbase suffered seven consecutive quarters of losses.
Why This MattersCoinbase’s Q1 results underscore the paradox of being buoyed by Bitcoin’s overperformance yet shackled by its volatility. While revenue diversification such as subscriptions may offer some downside protection, it’s noted that all such diversified streams are still crypto-related.Coinbase seeks higher court intervention in SEC lawsuit case.Coinbase Appeals SEC Lawsuit: A Regulatory Turning Point?Analysts predict imminent altseason as Bitcoin Dominance plummets: Altseason Alert: Bitcoin Dominance Crumbles, Altcoins Primed

Edward Snowden Delivers ‘Final’ Bitcoin Warning: Here’s Why


								Edward Snowden, the well-known whistleblower, reiterated his long standing concerns about Bitcoin’s privacy features, or the lack thereof in a recent post on X. Snowden’s latest comments emerge in the wake of a significant announcement by the Wasabi Wallet team concerning their decision to discontinue their coinjoin coordination service, a cornerstone for enhancing user privacy on the Bitcoin network.
‘The Clock Is Ticking’ For Bitcoin, Says Snowden
Snowden expressed his frustration with the slow pace of privacy enhancements within Bitcoin’s protocol. “I’ve been warning Bitcoin developers for ten years that privacy needs to be provided for at the protocol level. This is the final warning. The clock is ticking,” Snowden posted on X, commenting on Wasabi Wallet’s announcement from yesterday.


Wasabi Wallet, developed by zkSNACKs, has been a pioneering solution aimed at enhancing privacy for Bitcoin transactions through its coinjoin coordination service. However, a recent blog post by the Wasabi Wallet team detailed their decision to halt this service as of June 1, 2024.

“After years of relentless dedication to improve Bitcoin’s privacy, zkSNACKs, the company pioneering the development of Wasabi Wallet, is shutting down its coinjoin coordination service,” the post read. The developers highlighted ongoing regulatory pressures and the need for legal clarity as key reasons behind their decision.
Despite discontinuing the coinjoin service, Wasabi Wallet will continue to operate as a conventional BTC wallet. The team assured users of continued privacy enhancements through other features like client-side filtering, Tor integration, and custom coin selection, though they acknowledged these measures do not ensure complete privacy on their own.

This development arrives amid increasing scrutiny and legal challenges facing crypto privacy tools. Notably, New York federal prosecutors recently charged the founders of another privacy-focused wallet, Samourai Wallet, with facilitating illegal transactions worth over $2 billion. This action is part of a broader crackdown by US authorities on wallets and mixers associated with illicit activities.
While Snowden has lauded Bitcoin in February as the “most significant monetary advance since the creation of coinage,” his concerns about BTC built-in privacy have been consistent. In November 2021, he lauded the advancements made by Zcash, another cryptocurrency known for its strong privacy features.
He stated, “Zcash meaningfully advanced what cryptocurrency could DO, and that’s what I admired about it. And my primary criticism of Bitcoin is still, so many years later, that they haven’t addressed its enormous on-chain privacy problem.”
In contrast, Samson Mow, a prominent figure in promoting nation-state adoption of Bitcoin, downplayed the significance of Wasabi’s announcement. Mow argued, “I don’t get why everyone is crying about this. Wasabi is open-source. You can run your own coordinator too. This is like the Pirate Bay saying they won’t seed torrents anymore. Yes, good and smart move.”
At press time, BTC traded at $61,900.

Ethereum's next price target - ETH can climb to $3,300 ONLY if... - AMBCrypto



Ethereum’s price appreciated by more than 2.5% in the last 24 hours 
Most metrics and market indicators looked bullish on ETH’s charts

As market sentiment changed over the last few hours, Ethereum [ETH] benefited from the same as its daily chart turned green. However, the latest uptick might just be the beginning of a massive rally, especially since the king of altcoins’ price is now moving inside a bullish pattern. 
Ethereum’s bullish move
The last 7 days weren’t in the investors’ best interests as ETH’s price dropped by over 5%. However, as the market trend changed, ETH also managed to push its price up by more than 2.5% in 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,988.30 with a market capitalization of over $358 billion. 
Interestingly, things might get even better for ETH in the coming days. World of Charts, a popular crypto-analyst, recently shared a tweet highlighting that the ETH/BTC pair was moving inside a falling edge pattern. A successful breakout from the pattern could result in ETH hitting new highs in the coming months. 
Therefore, AMBCrypto checked ETH’s metrics to see whether it would manage a breakout. Our analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that ETH’s network growth hiked over the last few days. Simply put, more addresses were created to transfer the token as its active withdrawal rate climbed last week. 
Additionally, Ethereum’s supply held by top addresses also rose slightly, suggesting that buying pressure on the token was high.
On the contrary, its MVRV ratio remained low. At press time, ETH’s MVRV ratio had a value of -6.22%.
Source: Santiment
Ethereum’s weekly target
Since most metrics seemed bullish, AMBCrypto then checked ETH’s daily chart to see whether a further uptrend was inevitable. 
We found that ETH’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp uptick from the neutral level. The Money Flow Index (MFI) also went north. Both of these indicators suggest that the chances of a sustained bull rally are high. 
On the other hand, the MACD supported the sellers as it flashed a bearish crossover on the charts. 
Source: TradingView
We then analyzed Hyblock Capital’s data to find out the possible targets ETH might hit this week if the bull rally lasts. In order for ETH to sustain the rally, it will be crucial for the token to go above $3,100, as liquidations would rise sharply. 

Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25 

A hike in liquidations could result in a price correction. A successful breakout above that level could allow ETH to climb to $3,300 by the end of this week if everything falls into place.

Following the record outflow in Bitcoin ETFs due to the influence of the FED, there was a serious decrease in yesterday's outflows! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States recorded net outflows of $34.4 million on Thursday, slowing compared to the previous day's record outflows.
Daily Outflows Decrease in Spot Bitcoin ETFs
Grayscale's GBTC, which has been experiencing persistent outflows, was the only ETF to record net fund outflows on Thursday, totaling $55 million, according to SoSoValue data.


In comparison, Ark Invest's ARKB led daily net inflows with $13 million inflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs from Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie, Invesco and Galaxy Digital reported smaller net inflows, totaling $6 million.
BlackRock and Fidelity's Bitcoin funds, which rank second and third in terms of total net assets, both recorded zero flows on Thursday.





Bloomberg's ETF analyst James Seyffart previously explained that a zero-flow day is within ETFs' normal operations.

A record was set for Bitcoin ETF outflows on Wednesday, recording $563.7 million, the largest outflow ever. Fidelity's FBTC, which started its fund outflow just last week, witnessed $191 million outflow from the fund, surpassing GBTC's outflow.


Wednesday also marked the first day of daily net fund outflows for BlackRock's IBIT.
However, industry experts emphasize that such fluctuations are not unusual in the ETF world. “These ETFs generally run smoothly. Entries and exits are part of the norm in the life of an ETF,” said James Seyffart, acknowledging the importance of the exit figure.

Why Bitcoin Spiked Above $62,000 Following The April Jobs Report - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD spiked to over $62,000 in Friday morning trading following the U.S. Labor Department’s April jobs report.What Happened: The data shows the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in April, falling short of the consensus estimate of 240,000. The unemployment rate came in at 3.9%, slightly higher than the expected 3.8%.Economist and trader Alex Krüger described the report as “bullish” and “weaker than expected payrolls, yet still strong,” noting that the crypto market’s reaction was in sync with other risk assets.Read Also: ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ Author Robert Kiyosaki Unveils His Bitcoin Strategy Amid Market Crash: ‘The Best Time To Get Rich’Why It Matters: The mixed results of the April jobs report have sparked a debate about the potential implications for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and the broader economy. Some analysts, such as James van Straten, lead analyst at CryptoSlate, argue that two potential rate cuts in 2024 could lead to more inflation while not bringing back jobs.Self-proclaimed value investor Mike Alfred sees the weakening US Dollar Index (DXY) as a bullish sign for Bitcoin and select mining stocks.Nick Timiraos, Chief economics correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, believes the April jobs report is unlikely to change much for the Federal Reserve. He sees the Fed more focused on inflation data, with another jobs report due before their next meeting but notes that the report “will certainly help ease fears about reacceleration/overheating.”The market reaction lends further credibility to the thesis that macroeconomic developments are back to being the main driver of short-term Bitcoin price action.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $61,770, up 5.5% over the past 24 hours. What’s Next: These topics are expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Federal Reserve Takes Cautious Stand On Inflation, Powell Signals Preference For Rate Cuts Over HikesThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Bitcoin Fees Normalize After Runes' Coming Out Party Abruptly Ends - The Defiant

Runes’ on-chain activity and Bitcoin transaction fees dropped more than 97% in two weeks.Bitcoin’s transaction fees have returned to normal after a brief parabolic spike triggered by the launch of Runes, the hyped protocol enabling the creation of Bitcon-based tokens.Data from Dune analytics shows that Runes’ daily transaction count tanked 97.5% to 19,000 from an all-time high of 753,584 on April 23. The pull-back coincides with Runes’ share of Bitcoin’s on-chain activity dropping to 30% from 81.3% over the same period.Breakdown of Bitcoin transaction volume by type. Source: Dune Analytics.However, the sharp decline in Runes activity has provided a respite for ordinary Bitcoin users.Average transaction fees on the network have pulled back by 97% to $3.60 since posting an all-time high of $128 on April 20 coinciding with the launch of Runes, according to BitInfoCharts. The record high marked a 4,375% increase in fees from $2.86 two weeks prior.Ryan Song, head at CoinWestern Ventures, a Bitcoin mining consultancy firm, told The Defiant that Bitcoin’s Rune-induced congestion was the result of an initial flurry of token minting driven by rampant Runes speculation."The Bitcoin network was experiencing a heavy increase in load, which can be largely attributed to minting,” Song said. “A wave of minting operations ensued due to heightened speculation around Runes, placing unnatural demands on the already limited Bitcoin block space.”Bitcoin transaction fees. Source: BitInfoChartsOn April 29, Glassnode reported that 53% of the $117 million in fee revenue collected by Runes was accrued on its first day. On April 28, daily fee revenue had crashed to just $1.03 million, down 98% since the protocol’s debut.Bitcoin tokensRunes went live on April 20, the same day as Bitcoin's fourth halving event, leading to a bottleneck in network activity that spiked transactions as users raced to deploy tokens using the protocol.Runes leverages Ordinals inscriptions in a bid to overcome the efficiencies associated with the BRC-20 protocol — which allowed users to create fungible tokens on Bitcoin for the first time when it launched in March 2023. While BRC-20 tokens quickly exploded in popularity, the protocol garnered criticism for being data-intensive, driving mempool congestion, and pushing up transaction fees on Bitcoin.Despite the sharp decline in Runes activity, the protocol appears to have secured a healthy dominance over Bitcoin token activity — which accounted for nearly one-quarter of Bitcoin transactions on May 3.Runes made up 81% of Bitcoin token transactions, followed by BRC-20 tokens with 12%, and Ordinals with 5.65%.

                        Meme coins are set for a renaissance in the coming months. While their novelty premise has detractors dismissing them as flash-in-the-pan phenomena, several meme coin projects have proven their worth over the years and become the closest thing the notoriously volatile crypto industry has to “safe money”.The number one contender right now is stalwart daddy Dogecoin. $DOGE is a cryptocurrency that claims to be both the first meme coin and the first canine coin.Launched in 2013, Dogecoin creators Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer initially created it to satirize the minting frenzy. For the two nocoiners, it was a cynical overture, but they didn’t bet on crypto fans loving it.People saw it as a symbol of crypto’s fun and irreverence as well as its viral appeal and supported it loyally for over a decade to help it become the ninth biggest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of nearly $20 billion dollars. It also has endorsements from a diverse array of celebrities, including Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons and Mark Cuban.But the big question is this: can Dogecoin go from a current price of $0.1317 all the way up to $1? The most straightforward answer is “not anytime soon.”It’s also looking like the reign of the dog coins is over. Several new species have entered the market with viral appeal. This list will examine the four biggest species of meme coin right now to see which projects have what it takes to hit $1 in 2024.Will Dogecoin Reach $1?
DOGE has come close. Two years ago at the height of the Bitcoin bull run, Dogecoin set an all-time high of $0.7316. However, there’s grounds to think that this was substantially overpriced by the market. Since then, Dogecoin has shed a lot of value, while Bitcoin has this year set new all-time highs.It would take another bull run or a new use case for Dogecoin in order to pump the asset up to a dollar. With regards to the former, many analysts say a bull run is incoming now that Bitcoin has completed its fourth quadrennial halving.The halving was a predetermined software update that happened on April 20 and slashed mining rewards in half. Since this has bottlenecked the amount of Bitcoin hitting the open market, it’s possible that there could be a new bull run in the coming months. Others have argued that the halving was priced in this time.And with regards to the underlying tech, Dogecoin is pretty old. Like Bitcoin, it uses a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, whereby the miners with the most computing and electricity resources mine the most $DOGE. Due to Dogecoin’s smart contract limitations, it also can’t really boast of having an ecosystem.That means among conscientious investors, it’s likely to take a backseat to more useful or energy-efficient coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) and Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE).How About Frogs and the Sloths?
Pepe Coin ($PEPE) is the third biggest meme coin in the world. Like Dogecoin, it’s based on a meme that everybody and their grandmas have heard of. However, its $3.4 billion market cap still puts it a digit short of being in the same league as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.At today’s price of $0.058114 and with a previous all-time high of $0.00001064, it’s dead certain that PEPE is not on track to claim a dollar. However, one project that could is the sloth-themed Slerf coin ($SLERF). Slerf has an interesting story. On launch day, a major mishap resulted in the accidental burning of $10 million in $SLERF, intended for some 25,000 trusting presale buyers.Shortly after launching, Slerf ratcheted an all-time high (ATH) market cap of $750 million wSealana ($SEAL), the all-American redneck seal, within a few hours. As 24-hour trading volume surged close to $2.5 billion, the token actually hit an ATH price of $1.28 from a launch price of $1.10 before falling to its current level. Still, at its current price, Slerf is more likely to hit a dollar than Dogecoin.But it’s currently getting stiff competition from Slothana, a new sloth meme token that is about to launch. $SLOTH is the same genus as $SLERF with one key difference. He’s a major pothead, and is likely to be a hit among likeminded slow creatures.Finally, There’s Sealana the Meme Coin $SEAL
If dogs, frogs and sloths don’t do it for you, Solana’s Sealana ($SEAL), the all-American redneck seal, is quickly opening purse strings in a hilarious new presale. Sealana is a spin on the viral South Park character Gamer Guy, aka Fat Computer Nerd. Gamer Guy appeared in the hit cartoon’s side-splitting World of Warcraft episode and instantly became a viral meme all on his own, recognizable by his milk-bottle glasses, screen-locked stare, messy room and gravity-defying girth. He has since symbolized anyone from the legions of disgruntled keyboard warriors writing sharp, acerbic opinions in internet comments sections, to a kind of Everyman – a symbol of the idler in everyone. Sealana is Gamer Guy but Web3. Beached at his PC desk and growing by the day, Sealana is so absorbed in degen trades that he’s abandoned his previously trim figure for a diet of chips and tinned tuna. His obsession with finding the next big Solana meme coin keeps his flippers busy and his room looking like a bomb hit it. A true patriot in search of the lost American Dream!VIDEOHis presale is barely 48 hours old and it has already taken in over $150,000 in investments, according to the website. There are rumors that the Sealana team was also behind the popular Slerf ($SLERF) project. Rumors suggest that the team wants another successful launch, this time without accidentally burning $10m in tokens.For every 1 SOL, investors get 6,900 $SEAL tokens after the ICO’s concludes. This puts them in pole position to exploit some potentially explosive appreciation through the presale and beyond.Users can pay using a widget on the website or by sending SOL from a decentralized wallet to this address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.Interested?

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin leaped over $61,000 in the hour that followed the release of a government employment report.At time of publication, the price of Bitcoin is around $61,640, up 5.2% on the day, according to data from CoinGecko.Bitcoin's price surge followed the U.S. government’s Nonfarm Payrolls report, published this morning, which forecasted that the unemployment rate for April was 3.9%—that's 0.1% higher than the 3.8% expected.High unemployment makes it more likely that the Fed will consider lowering interest rates, increasing the attractiveness of risk assets like stocks and crypto.The Fed lowered rates to between zero to 0.25% in response to the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. But two years later, in March 2022, the Fed began hiking rates to fight inflation. The hikes continued until they peaked at 5.25% to 5.50% in July 2023. Bitcoin ended that month at $29,230.11, down 4.1% for the month and half the price it is now.It’s been a rocky week for Bitcoin. Since the Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs went live, on April 30, Bitcoin’s price tumbled, first  to below $60,000 and eventually slipping below $57,000.This led Bitcoin billionaire Arthur Hayes to predict that Bitcoin's price has bottomed out. In a blog post, the former BitMEX CEO predicted that prices would “bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher.”Bitcoin ETFs have been taking a hit with a weekly outflow of $599 million, according to CoinShares. The U.S. in particular took a huge hit of $860 million outflowing, with BlackRock’s IBIT fund taking its first daily loss yesterday. Hong Kong’s ETFs were a bright spot, though, flowing in nearly $300 million in its first week.Ethereum has seen similar gains, since the publication of the Nonfarm Payroll report, climbing 2.8% to around $3,050. Over the same period Solana jumped 4.4% to around $142, amid a crazy week for meme coins on the blockchain.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

‘There’s Not Much More Downside Left To Go’: Trader Says Bitcoin Close to Bottom After Deepest Retrace of Cycle - The Daily Hodl


								A cryptocurrency analyst and trader is saying Bitcoin (BTC) may have reached a market bottom after correcting down into the high $50,000 range.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 74,900 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin’s latest correction is the cycle’s deepest, suggesting a further decline is unlikely.










“This single corrective period is now the deepest corrective period in this cycle to date. It has eclipsed the 23% corrective period that we saw in early 2023. This is now deeper than that. This is getting to even minus 24% territory. So, we now know this is the deepest retrace in this cycle.”

Given the relative degree of the correction, the analyst believes Bitcoin is most likely bottoming at these price levels and will start to rally once more. He also says another reason he believes the bottom may be in is because the correction is currently the second longest at about 50 days.
“I think there’s not much more downside left to go. So the risk-to-reward ratio here is definitely favoring the bulls in terms of getting to a bottom quite soon because we’re seeing retrace depth get to the point where it’s the deepest correction in this cycle…
We have a deep correction. We have a long correction. How much deeper can it be? How much longer can it go on for? We are getting really close to the bottom here just based on pullbacks in this cycle.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $59,332 at time of writing, up more than 2% in the last 24 hours.

Friend.Tech Launches Version 2 With Native Token Airdrop, But Not Everything Goes According To Plan... - Benzinga

Decentralized social platform Friend.Tech made a splash on Friday with the launch of its highly anticipated version 2 and the airdrop of its native token. What Happened: However, the initial excitement was quickly tempered by a dramatic price crash and technical issues plaguing the airdrop process.Starting its trading journey on the Base network—a Coinbase-supported Layer-2 blockchain for Ethereum ETH/USD—the FRIEND token wicked to a high of $169. However, the excitement was short-lived as it quickly retracted to trade below $1.30 at the time of writing, according to data from DexScreener.Friend.Tech, which began operations in August of the previous year as an invite-only platform, has been known for rewarding user engagement with a points system. The introduction of the Money Club is expected to enhance this model by providing a dedicated space for financial discussions and networking, further enriching the community experience.Despite the buzz surrounding the version 2 launch and the FRIEND token airdrop—initially slated for April 20 but later adjusted—the platform’s total locked crypto assets have seen a decline.

Bitcoin Price Alert: Key Levels to Watch Amid Market Flux

Bitcoin, the first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to lows of $56,500 earlier in the week as investors became jittery about the Fed interest rate decision. In what seemingly soothed the markets, Fed Chair Jerome Powell doused fears about interest rate hikes, stating that this was unlikely to be the Fed's next move presently. Bitcoin then started to rebound. On-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock noted that Bitcoin's drop below $57,000 brought it to the same levels of holders in loss as in similar drawbacks in the previous cycle. IntoTheBlock highlights the key supply and demand levels to watch for Bitcoin as the crypto market faces uncertainty. These levels have emerged as points of interest, reflecting the ongoing battle between bulls and bears as Bitcoin seeks direction amid volatile market conditions.The $62,000 level is seen as a significant resistance point, a price at which there are a substantial amount of sell orders. Here, Bitcoin faces significant selling pressure from traders looking to capitalize on short-term gains. This level represents a psychological barrier for many market participants, who view it as a potential point of reversal or consolidation in Bitcoin's price trajectory.Conversely, the $58,000 mark is viewed as a crucial support level, a price at which buy orders accumulate, reflecting strong demand. This is seen as a critical line in the sand for Bitcoin bulls, who are keen to defend this level and prevent further downside movement. A breach of this support zone could trigger additional selling pressure and potentially lead to a deeper correction in Bitcoin's price.In the days ahead, market participants will closely monitor price action for clues about Bitcoin's next move. The recent volatility on the market, driven by a combination of macroeconomic factors and investor sentiment, has heightened uncertainty and added to the significance of these supply and demand zones.At the time of writing, BTC was up 0.37% in the last 24 hours to $59,095.

Dutch Authorities Bust Alleged Gambling Platform Scam, Seize Millions - Coin Edition


							

Dutch authorities arrest suspects in alleged $30M crypto scam on Zkasino platform



The ZKasino platform is said to have promised high returns but was designed to fail.



The FIOD seized €11.4M in crypto, real estate & a luxury car linked to the suspect.




Dutch authorities, the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) has cracked down on a large-scale online gambling platform scam on April 29th, 2024. They arrested a 26-year-old man suspected of fraud, embezzlement and money laundering in connection with ZKasino which is the platform at the center of the investigation.







The investigation revealed a concerning pattern. Over $30 million USD in cryptocurrency had been invested by victims worldwide on ZKasino. The platform allegedly promised high returns within a short timeframe of 30 days.



However, a technical analysis of the platform’s smart contract – the self-executing code governing its operations – revealed a crucial detail. The contract was deliberately designed in a way that made it impossible to deliver the promised returns. This strongly suggests a “rug pull” scheme, a notorious crypto scam tactic where developers vanish with investor funds after raising capital through a project.









FIOD officials swiftly took action. A search warrant was executed, leading to the seizure of digital evidence as well as over €11.4 million worth of assets. This included real estate likely purchased with stolen funds and a luxury car that could be used by the suspect. Mulitple cryptocurrencies are believed to be linked to the scam. To ensure a thorough investigation, the suspect’s detention was extended by a court order.



The investigation itself was initiated based on reports on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) and intelligence gathered by FIOD’s own departments. Recognizing the evolving nature of financial crime, FIOD collaborated with cryptocurrency exchange Binance. This collaboration proved crucial, as it helped secure millions of euros in stolen cryptocurrencies before they could be further dispersed or laundered.
