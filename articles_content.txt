This crypto whale lost $300K in 2 days trading PEPE


The meme coin boom in 2024 has attracted greedy speculators looking for quick gains in a player-vs-player trading landscape. Despite some successful stories that made it to the spotlight, most traders have accrued losses—as with a PEPE whale who lost over $300,000 in the last two days.
In particular, data by SpotOnChain estimates this cryptocurrency whale has lost $188,000 in a 15-day $15.10 million trade. As suggested by on-chain activity, the whale started trading PEPE on May 4 with a $2.68 million purchase.
On May 5, the trader bought another stack of PEPE worth $7.754 million. Later, the multisig wallet likely sold it all on May 7 for $10.557 million and a $123,000 profit.


PEPE whale FOMO and realize losses
However, the ‘Fear of Missing Out’ (FOMO) dominated the whale, as PEPE pumped in a meme coin mania comeback. Thus, the trader purchased $4.853 million worth of tokens on May 16 to sell two days later with losses.
On May 18, the whale deposited all its PEPE tokens on Binance at an estimated value of $4.542 million. This last trading activity resulted in losses of $311,000, overcoming the previous profits.

Known cryptocurrency influencers wonder whether the meme coin mania is finally over.

Meme coins and the greater fool theory
In conclusion, the trader’s unfortunate loss serves as a cautionary tale for those considering investing in meme coins. The risks associated with trading these highly volatile and speculative cryptocurrencies cannot be overstated.
Meme coins, such as PEPE, often lack fundamental value and are driven by hype and social media buzz. Traders who buy these coins are essentially gambling in the hope that someone else will buy them at a higher price.
This mentality aligns with the “Greater Fool Theory,” which suggests that profits can be made by buying overvalued assets and selling them to a “greater fool.”
However, this theory also highlights the inherent risk of such investments, as the market eventually runs out of willing buyers. When the hype dies down, and demand dwindles, traders can be left holding worthless assets, leading to substantial financial losses.
The story of this trader’s misfortune should serve as a reminder to approach meme coin investments cautiously. It is crucial to conduct thorough research, understand the risks involved, and never invest more than one can afford to lose.

One of the Largest Cryptocurrency Exchanges Responds to "Tether (USDT) Will Be Delisted" Claim - Bitcoin Sistemi


Kraken, the second largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, announced that it will continue to list Tether (USDT) on the European market despite regulatory uncertainties.
The announcement comes in response to recent news suggesting that Kraken may cancel its support for USDT in the EU region in line with upcoming EU CryptoAsset Markets (MiCA) rules.


Mark Greenberg, Kraken's Global Head of Asset Growth and Management, clarified the company's stance in a statement:

“Let's be clear: Kraken continues to list USDT in Europe and we have no plans to delist at this time. We know our European customers value access to USDT and we continue to evaluate all options to offer USDT in the upcoming system.”


Greenberg emphasized that Kraken will comply with all legal requirements, even those it disagrees with, but the rules are not yet finalized. “We continue to do everything we can to continue offering all relevant stablecoins to our European customers,” he added.





This announcement follows OKX's decision in March to delist most of its USDT trading pairs in the EU.

Analyst Says Markets ‘100% Underestimating’ Odds of Ethereum ETF Approval, Warns Top for Memecoins in Sight - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst thinks that market participants are too pessimistic about the odds that regulators will green-light a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Psycho tells his 501,800 followers on the social media platform X that people are not bullish enough on ETH right now.










“Markets 100% underestimating odds of an ETH ETF.
It’s also underestimating the price impact it’ll have.
Buying ETH under $3,000 pre-ETF will eventually be an obvious hindsight trade. Just like how it’s now obvious you should have bought Bitcoin pre-ETF.” 
Data from the Ethereum-based prediction market platform Polymarket shows that only 13% of traders believe that an ETH ETF will be approved by the end of the month.
Looking at the broader digital asset market, Altcoin Psycho thinks that market participants will eventually rotate their capital to blue-chip crypto projects at the expense of memecoins.
“At some point all this scattered attention will narrow via a flight to quality, which also means a memecoin sell-off. I don’t think the cycle top is in but I think the memecoin top is not far away. Memecoins are a gateway drug not the end game, study past cycles if you disagree.” 
As for the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) sector, the analyst says that while many are calling for the AI bubble to burst, he thinks it’s still in its earlier stages and set to become one of the biggest speculative manias ever seen.
“Most say the AI bubble will soon burst, I’ll be the contrarian and say the bubble’s just starting.
It’s my highest conviction take since saying SOL at $15 was a must-buy…
99% of AI startups will fail. When this happens, naysayers will prematurely claim victory. But once the dust settles, the surviving 1% will be so valuable that they’ll alone carry the bubble beyond any other bubble we’ve seen.”

Crypto Hiring: Eclipse Labs names new leader in week of CEO updates - Blockworks


Two crypto companies named new CEOs this week. What some would consider an anti-crypto firm did too.
Vijay Chetty replaced Neel Somani as Eclipse Labs’ chief executive, the company said in a Wednesday X post.
Chetty had been the blockchain startup’s chief growth officer for the last year or so. He previously held leadership roles at Uniswap Labs, dYdX Trading and Ripple Labs.
His promotion came after sexual misconduct allegations surfaced against Somani — claims the now-former CEO called “false.”
Hack VC, which co-led a $50 million Series A funding round for Eclipse Labs in March, said Somani’s alleged behavior was “unacceptable.”

“Since learning about the allegations, we [have] worked hard with other investors and the team to correct the situation, including urging Neel to resign, and we are pleased to see that happen,” Hack VC added.

A second CEO development this week is a temporary appointment. 
Bitcoin miner Bitfarms on Monday named co-founder Nicolas Bonta the company’s interim president and CEO while an executive search continues. The switch happened the same day that Bitfarms ousted Geoffrey Morphy from the CEO post.
The mining company had said in March that Morphy would be leaving the role only after his replacement was found. That transition was accelerated after Morphy last week filed a statement of claim against Bitfarms in the Superior Court of Ontario.
Morphy is claiming $27 million worth of damages for alleged breach of contract and wrongful dismissal. Bitfarms said the claims are “without merit,” noting the company “intends to defend itself vigorously.” 
A third CEO update came from a company nobody would call crypto-focused. 
Vanguard, a fund giant with more than $8 trillion assets under management, named the former head of BlackRock’s ETF business as its incoming CEO. Salim Ramji will fill the role in July, replacing the retiring Tim Buckley.  
Why might this be notable from a crypto standpoint?
Well, Ramji helped the world’s largest asset manager launch the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) — a fund that, in four months on the market, has grown to roughly $18 billion in assets. 
BlackRock’s spot bitcoin fund launch reflected an effort to “help investors gain access to parts of the market that otherwise have been more difficult or really expensive or opaque for them to access otherwise,” Ramji said in a July 2023 interview on Bloomberg TV. 
Read more: Yes, Vanguard’s new CEO supported BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF launch
He now leads a company that has called crypto’s investment case “weak.” Vanguard also does not allow users of its brokerage platform to buy and trade bitcoin ETFs.  
Some expect the hire could spark a change in Vanguard’s attitude toward the space, even if gradual.
Ramji signaled in an interview with Barron’s this week that he may not push a change, noting “it’s important for firms to have consistency in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer.”
But never say never, as the adage goes.
“Eventually…Vanguard will indeed offer bitcoin ETFs,” Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, told Blockworks. “From a purely business perspective, it’s foolish not to. And Salim is not foolish.”
Other notable hiring news

Jack Melnick, who left Polygon Labs last week, joined layer-1 Berachain. His title — head of DeFi — remained the same.    
Luc Froehlich, who formerly led the digital assets unit at Fidelity International, is now chief commercial officer of decentralized credit intelligence platform Synnax.
Ava Labs marketing executive Jay Kurahashi-Sofue said Friday he would be leaving the company after four years there. His next role was not immediately clear.  
Noah Levine is set to help lead Visa’s on-chain analytics efforts as a crypto analyst. He was previously a data and analytics lead at RTFKT.
Crypto-focused lawyers Lewis Rinaudo Cohen, Gregory Strong and Sarah Chen joined Cahill Gordon & Reindel as partners of its digital assets and emerging technology practice.

Unexpected Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Ban Comes from a Country Struggling with US Sanctions - Bitcoin Sistemi

Venezuela has announced plans to disconnect all Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining facilities from the national electricity system in order to control energy demand.
The Ministry of Electric Energy (MPPPE) announced the initiative on Friday, which includes a plan to monitor high energy users participating in this activity.


“The goal is to disconnect all cryptocurrency mining facilities in the country from the National Electricity System (SEN), preventing the high impact on demand and thus enabling us to continue providing an efficient and reliable service to all Venezuelan people,” MPPPE said in a statement on its Instagram account. said.
The measures were announced after at least 2,000 cryptocurrency mining machines were seized on Thursday in Maracay, Aragua state, about 120 kilometers southwest of Caracas.





According to local media reports, this action is linked to an anti-corruption operation launched by the Venezuelan government last year, which resulted in the arrest of dozens of officials from Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the National Inspectorate of Cryptocurrencies (Sunacrip) and other state institutions.
Since last year, Sunacrip has been under the control of a restructured board following the arrest of Chief Inspector Joselit Ramírez, who was linked to former Oil Minister and former PDVSA President Tareck El Aissami. El Aissami's arrest was announced by the prosecutor's office early last month.



El Aissami was accused of “treason, seizure of public property, verification of relationships or influence, money laundering and organization.”
Carabobo state governor Rafael Lacava stated that they restricted cryptocurrency facilities, which he said consumed a significant amount of megawatts, which led to power outages.





There has been an electricity crisis in Venezuela since 2009. Due to major outages in 2019, many cities were left without electricity for seven days.

Solana Leads with 91M Daily Transactions, Surpasses Ethereum: CoinGecko Report

                        Solana has proven to be the fastest among large blockchains, processing a staggering 91 million transactions in a single day.According to a recent update by CoinGecko, on April 6, Solana achieved a record-breaking daily average of 1,504 transactions per second (TPS) during the memecoin frenzy.This makes the blockchain an impressive 46 times faster than Ethereum and over 5 times faster than Polygon, which boasts the highest TPS among Ethereum scaling solutions.Solana Achieves 1.6% of Maximum Speed
Despite its position as the fastest blockchain, Solana has only achieved 1.6% of its theoretical maximum speed of 65,000 TPS.The surge in the number of transactions has led to network congestion, raising questions about how quickly Solana can achieve higher real TPS after implementing its upcoming upgrades.The second-fastest blockchain identified in the report is Sui, another non-EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) platform.Sui recorded its highest real TPS of 854 in July 2023, driven by the popularity of the on-chain game Sui 8192.Other notable non-EVM blockchains include TON with 175 TPS and Near Protocol with 118 TPS.On the lower end of the spectrum, Aptos registered 49 TPS, Starknet had 12 TPS, Bitcoin achieved 11 TPS, and Thorchain recorded 2 TPS.When comparing the non-EVM blockchains to the EVM and EVM-compatible blockchains, the former outperformed the latter with an average peak TPS of 284, while the 17 largest EVM-based blockchains had an average of just 74 TPS.Binance Smart Chain (BSC) stood out as the fastest among the EVM blockchains, reaching a real TPS of 378 on December 7, 2023, driven by increased on-chain activity.Polygon, the leading Ethereum scaling solution, achieved 190 TPS on November 16, 2023, making it 8.4 times faster than Ethereum itself.Ethereum Layer 2 Solutions Yet to Exceed Layer 1 Blockchains
The report indicates that Ethereum scaling solutions and layer 2 solutions have yet to surpass other layer 1 blockchains in terms of real processing speed.This may be attributed to the lower number of on-chain transactions on Ethereum scaling solutions, resulting in slower realized TPS for these blockchains.In total, Ethereum and its ten largest scaling solutions achieved a combined real TPS of 500, surpassing BSC but still trailing behind Solana and Sui.Other scaling solutions that outpaced Ethereum in terms of TPS include Arbitrum (59 TPS), Linea (56 TPS), Base (37 TPS), and Mantle (25 TPS).Over the past year, 24 out of the 25 blockchains analyzed experienced their highest real TPS, with activity levels reaching new heights.This surge can be attributed to the rise of inscriptions and memecoin speculation, which have fueled increased on-chain activity.As reported, the cryptocurrency market has witnessed the launch of over 1 million new tokens since the beginning of April.Ethereum and Solana, in particular, have been at the forefront of this token frenzy, with Ethereum hosting over 370,000 new tokens and Solana boasting an impressive 640,000 new tokens, mostly consisting of memecoins.

Will Washington Wreck Or Welcome Crypto? Looming Vote Holds Bitcoin's Fate


								With Bitcoin rocketing in value and Wall Street circling like a hawk, the US crypto industry is holding its breath as a crucial vote approaches in Washington next week. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or Fit21, could reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets, potentially welcoming the industry into the fold or slamming the brakes on its recent growth spurt.

Fit21: A Lifeline Or A Leash?
Fit21 proposes a major shift in how the US government handles digital currencies. Currently, the regulatory landscape is fragmented, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) both having a say.
Fit21 would establish the CFTC as the primary regulator for crypto, giving the industry a clearer picture of the rules it needs to follow. The bill would also set up guardrails to protect consumers from risky behavior and establish protocols for how these assets are held and treated in bankruptcy proceedings.
Total crypto market cap currently at $2.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView
The bicoin industry has thrown its weight behind Fit21, calling it “crucial” for the future of the US digital asset market. The lack of clear regulations has been a major sticking point for the industry, with some companies even threatening to abandon the US altogether.
The Crypto Council for Innovation worries that the US is falling behind other countries in embracing bitcoin innovation. In an open letter to lawmakers, it argued:

“By passing this legislation, we can accelerate the growth of blockchain technology and digital assets, fostering financial inclusion and protecting national security.”

Wall Street Enters The Crypto Fray
Adding another layer of intrigue to the upcoming vote is the recent entry of Wall Street giants into the crypto space. The approval of a wave of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January has opened the door for Wall Street to get a piece of the crypto pie.
These ETFs allow traditional investors to invest in Bitcoin without having to directly buy and hold the cryptocurrency themselves. The potential for hefty fees associated with custody of these ETFs has some industry observers worried that Wall Street’s involvement could stifle innovation.

Will Bitcoin Find A Home In The US?
With the price of Bitcoin on the rise and pressure mounting from both the digital asset industry and Wall Street, the upcoming vote on Fit21 is a watershed moment for cryptocurrencies in the US. If passed, the bill could usher in a new era of regulatory clarity and foster the growth of the industry.

However, if the bill is defeated, the future of crypto in the US remains uncertain, potentially leading to an exodus of crypto companies and hampering innovation. With 10 days left until the vote, all eyes are on Washington as lawmakers decide whether to welcome crypto with open arms or keep it at bay.

New bitcoin addresses at multi-year lows: What's behind the decline?


Bitcoin (BTC) network activity has shown a significant downward trend in the creation of new addresses, reaching its lowest level since July 2018. 
Data from market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock reveals a 7-day average of only 276,000 new addresses. This decline suggests fewer new investors are entering the cryptocurrency space.
The “New Addresses” indicator monitors the daily creation of new addresses on the BTC network. When this metric is high, it typically indicates an influx of new investors.

However, returning investors and holders creating multiple wallets for privacy can also increase this number. Overall, these factors contribute to some level of adoption, suggesting that a high number of new addresses can be a long-term bullish signal for Bitcoin
Decline in new addresses: Analyzing the causes
The recent approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has offered investors a new way to gain exposure to Bitcoin. 
These ETFs provide a more traditional investment route, potentially drawing interest away from on-chain Bitcoin transactions and, hence, could cause the observed decline in new addresses.
The high transaction fees that followed the excitement around Runes caused a significant drop in active addresses, with the 7-day moving average falling below 700,000 for the first time since March 2020.  Although fees have stabilized, with the average fee dropping from $31.4 on April 23 to $2.97 on May 18, the number of active addresses remains low.
Broader market slowdown
BTC Active Addresses, Price and  Volume . Source: Santiment
The broader cryptocurrency market slowdown could also be contributing to the decline. 
Lower network activity, indicated by a multi-year low in the 30-day active address count, suggests reduced demand for Bitcoin transactions. This metric, which tracks distinct addresses participating in transactions over 30 days, dropped to 12.64 million, a level last seen in February 2019.
The decrease in new Bitcoin addresses and overall network activity raises questions about the health and demand of the Bitcoin market.
While high network activity typically correlates with increased demand and price stability, the current decline could indicate a shift in investor behavior, possibly towards derivatives speculation rather than organic use.
Bitcoin price analysis
By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $66,897 with daily gain of 0.27%, while on the weekly chart, BTC is up almost 10%.

The decline in new Bitcoin addresses reflects a complex interplay of factors, including the introduction of spot ETFs, transaction fee dynamics, and broader market trends. 
Understanding these elements is crucial for interpreting the current state and future direction of Bitcoin’s market demand.
While the lower number of new addresses might suggest reduced interest, it also highlights evolving investment behaviors and the ongoing impact of transaction fees and market conditions on the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

We asked ChatGPT-4o what will be Cardano price at the end of 2024; Here's what it said


Decentralized finance (DeFi) project Cardano (ADA) has seen an uptick in whale activity that has surged at least tenfold. Indeed, the increase in whale activity can potentially influence ADA’s price trajectory.
In this context, ChatGPT-4o, OpenAI’s advanced and recent artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot model, has offered insights into how ADA is likely to trade by the end of 2024. The chatbot is more accurate, faster, and cost-effective than other models.
The tool provided both conservative and optimistic price estimates. ChatGPT-4o suggested that if the general crypto market experiences steady but moderate growth, the ADA price could range between $1 and $2 by the end of 2024.


On the other hand, the AI platform offered a more optimistic scenario in which, if positive trends and significant developments occur, ADA could potentially climb higher, reaching between $2 and $5. Indeed, if ADA hits $5, the price movement will represent an increase of over 1,000% from the current valuation.

Factors influencing ADA’s price 
ChatGPT-4o also highlighted several factors likely to impact ADA’s price. The tool acknowledged that increased holdings by whales suggest strong confidence in ADA. This scenario potentially indicates a bullish outlook due to higher demand from large investors.
At the same time, positive developments, such as institutional adoptions or technological advancements within Cardano, could drive prices higher, while negative news could have the opposite effect.
According to the tool, continued network development, enhanced smart contract capabilities, and achieving key milestones will likely positively influence ADA’s value. Notably, recent data from Cardano developer IOHK, released on May 17, reveals ongoing growth in several metrics. The number of smart contracts on the network has reached 46,060, with 171 projects launched.

The AI model also noted that ADA investors should be on the lookout for regulatory changes, broader economic conditions, such as global stability, interest rates, and market liquidity.
ADA price analysis 
Currently, ADA continues to trade below the $0.50 resistance zone, and reaching the $1 level would be significant for the asset’s growth. Notably, whales have aggressively accumulated ADA tokens at this level. 
Beyond the factors highlighted by the AI tool, Cardano will likely benefit from increased exposure. For instance, reports suggest that crypto exchange Gemini might be planning to list ADA.
At the time of reporting, ADA was trading at $0.47, having faced a short-term correction of 1.51% in 24 hours. However, the token remains bullish on the weekly timeframe, having rallied over 6%.

Overall, ADA bulls have significant work ahead to move the token away from the consolidation below $1.

Majority of Binance-Listed Tokens Decline Within 6 Months


More than 80% of the tokens listed on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, have dropped in value since their listing over the past six months.
Crypto researcher Flow reported that many of Binance’s new listings are tokens supported by top-tier venture capital firms and introduced at high valuations.
Binance Listing Now Provides ‘Exit Liquidity’ For VCs

According to Flow, only 5 out of 31 selected tokens on Binance have seen price increases since their launch. These tokens—ORDI, JUP, WIF, JTO, and MEME—are primarily meme coins or projects without major venture capital backing.
Over the past six months, these tokens have surged individually by over 50%. Specifically, ORDI rose by approximately 262%, JTO increased by 62%, and JUP by 58%. WIF and MEME also saw gains of more than 117% and 8.5%, respectively.
Conversely, tokens backed by top VCs have performed poorly. Binance Labs’ NFP token, Pantera Capital-backed OMNI, and AEVO, supported by VCs including Coinbase, Paradigm, and Dragonfly, have plummeted by about 63%, 52%, and 68%, respectively.

“If you held a portfolio where you would invest an equal amount at each new Binance listing, you would be down over 18% in the past 6 months,” Flow stated.

Flow furthered that many of these projects launch at high fully diluted values (FDVs). He said an average FDV for a Binance listing could exceed $4.2 billion, sometimes reaching as high as $11 billion with “no real users or a strong community behind” these projects.

Notably, Flow’s finding starkly contrasts last year’s analysis by crypto investor Ren & Heinrich, which found that token prices rose 73% in the first 30 days following their listing on Binance. At the time, Ren & Heinrich suggested that Binance’s emergence as the dominant global crypto exchange gave its token listings much more attention among industry players.

Market experts have explained that Binance’s dominance and high liquidity have made it attractive for insiders to exit their investments in these assets.

“More often than not, tokens launching on Binance are not investment vehicle anymore – all their upside potential are already taken away. Instead, they represent exit liquidity for insiders who capitalize on retail lack of access to quality early investment opportunities,” Flow explained.

Bitcoin soars as exchange withdrawals dip: Further gains for BTC? - AMBCrypto



Despite the massive price surge, BTC withdrawals from exchanges were relatively low.
Activity on the Bitcoin ecosystem continued to decline.

Bitcoin [BTC] has seen an unexpected surge in price over the last few days, which has inspired hope amongst traders and holders. Due to the surge in optimism, addresses have been holding on to your BTC.
Withdrawals decline
A minor withdrawal of Bitcoin occurred yesterday, with 10,000 BTC leaving exchange wallets. The total value of the withdrawn Bitcoin is estimated to be around $630 million.
This strong demand for Bitcoin suggests a potential resurgence of interest in the cryptocurrency market.
Analysts note that the level of consistent demand for Bitcoin hasn’t been this high since late 2020, marking a significant shift in investor sentiment.
Source: X
At press time, BTC was trading at $67,049.74 and its price had declined by 0.74% in the last 24 hours. Most holders of BTC were profitable, as BTC was just $6,000 dollars away from its all-time high.
The velocity at which BTC was trading at had declined. This meant that the frequency at which BTC was trading at had declined.
Even though this can be perceived as a negative sign for BTC, a declining velocity also meant that a lot of addresses were holding onto their Bitcoin and were refusing to sell.
Additionally, the total number of holders of BTC has also surged, indicating that a large number of addresses have accumulated significant amounts of BTC.
Coupled with the rising number of holders, there was an opposite pattern seen in miner holdings. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the supply held by miners had significantly fallen.
This could prove to be positive for BTC in the long run. If miners fail to generate high amounts of fees, it becomes difficult for them to remain profitable.
To keep their business sustainable, they sometimes resort to selling their holdings, which ends up adding selling pressure to BTC.
A lower supply of BTC held by miners means that these sections of holders would have less of an impact on the price of BTC going forward.

Activity on the decline
One of the reasons why miners fail to generate fees is due to inactivity on the network. Over the last few weeks, the number of daily active addresses on the Bitcoin network had fallen.
Coupled with that, the number of NFTs being traded on the network also declined. This suggested a waning interest in Bitcoin’s ecosystem.

'The Dogecoin Explosion Made Something Click In Me:' Veteran Trader Shares Secrets To Turning Pennies Into Millions With Meme Coins - Benzinga

Meme coins, with their wild price swings and internet-fueled frenzy, have become a land of opportunity for some cryptocurrency traders. Millionaire trader Unipcs, also known as the ‘Bonk Guy‘, is a shining example, having amassed significant wealth by riding the surges of these digital assets.In an interview with Benzinga, Bonk Guy offered a rare glimpse into his strategies and insights on the meme coin market, shedding light on the world of high-risk, high-reward crypto investing.Early Recognition And Pattern HuntingHis foray into meme coins predates the rise of popular names like Bonk and Wif. “I’ve been trading meme coins for a very long time,” he says, “and prior to Bonk BONK/USD and Wif WIF/USD existing.”He credits the 2021 Dogecoin DOGE/USD surge and the retail investor movement on WallStreetBets for sparking his interest. “Seeing all the retail buzz around the GME GME/USD short squeeze, the WSB memecoin mania, and the resulting Dogecoin explosion made something click in me,” Bonk Guy explains.He soon noticed a pattern with meme coins and was able to predict which ones were likely to explode, allowing him to invest strategically.The Power Of Community And LiquidityBonk Guy emphasizes the crucial role strong community backing plays in a meme coin’s success. “I make sure there is a strong community because meme coins thrive on strong community,” he states.He thrives on projects with “retarded cult-like believers who think their meme coins will flip Bitcoin BTC/USD, go to 100 billion dollars market cap, and cure world hunger,” he says with a touch of amusement. “The more irrational their passion for their meme coins, the better,” he adds. According to Unipics, this fervent loyalty is crucial for propelling a meme coin towards significant price increases.Liquidity is another key factor. While meme coins offer the potential for explosive growth, they require sufficient trading volume to be readily convertible into cash. “Eventually, for any meme coin to go mainstream it needs liquidity,” Unipics explains. “So, I also pay attention to volume and CEX listings over time.”The Bonk Bet: A Case Study In Meme Coin ManiaUnipics’ sizable investment in Bonk, a Solana SOL/USD based meme coin, serves as a prime example of his approach. While initially skeptical, he was swayed by a combination of factors: the influence of a respected crypto analyst, Bonk’s status as the leading meme coin on Solana, and the potential for Solana’s own price appreciation. Diamond Hands: Riding The RollercoasterMeme coin trading is a wild ride, and Unipics acknowledges the emotional toll it can take. He advocates for a “moon or bust” mentality, where investors write off their holdings and focus solely on reaching their target profit or accepting a complete loss. “Once I buy an asset, I just write it off in my mind,” he explains. “I’m not moved or fazed if it goes to zero. I simply give myself a target and hold until it reaches my target or goes to zero. Nothing else matters.” This approach, he argues, allows for a more detached and less stressful trading experience.Also Read: Before You Trust Another Crypto Guru, Read This Study’s ResultsLooking Ahead: Bonk, Floki, And BeyondBonk Guy remains bullish on Bonk, citing its association with Solana and the potential for further growth.“I’m obviously very bullish on Bonk for reasons I already listed,” he says. “I’m the ‘bonk guy’ for a reason.” He also highlights Floki FLOKI/USD, another meme coin with a strong track record, as an underrated gem. “Besides Bonk, I’m very excited about Floki,” he reveals. “It is my biggest memecoin bag, and I think it is currently the most underrated major memecoin.While Floki launched in 2021, it has outperformed every other major memecoin including PEPE PEPE/USD, Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, DOGE, except WIF, this year. “Yet barely anyone talks about it on CT [Crypto Twitter]. I think it will surprise many this year,” he predicts.He also expressed interest in smaller cap meme coins like Lmeow on Ethereum ETH/USD and Linda on Linea chain.For those looking to make substantial profits from meme coins, he advises paying attention to his previous strategies and maintaining a strong, patient mindset.Read Next: Crypto Traders As Socially Valuable As Escorts To Brits, Study FindsImage created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

OpenAI leadership responds to former employee safety allegations

Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, the CEO and president of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, respectively, recently took to X.com to publicly discuss the recent departure of Jan Leike, arguably the company’s former top safety officer. As Cointelegraph recently reported, Leike was the head of alignment. He resigned his post on May 17 citing irreconcilable differences with the company’s leadership. Source: @janleike on X.com.Among Leike’s allegations was the assertion that “safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products” at OpenAI. It didn’t take long for Brockman and Altman to respond, both taking to X.com within 24 hours of Leike’s post to respond.As for Brockman’s part, he laid out a long and winding post replete with a three-pronged strategy for safety alignment at the company. He began by expressing gratitude for Leike’s work at the company before disputing claims that OpenAI wasn’t focused on safety. Source: @gdb on X.com.“First, we have raised awareness of the risks and opportunities of AGI,” Brockman wrote, pointing out that the company has “called for international governance of AGI before such calls were popular.”“Second, we have been putting in place the foundations needed for safe deployment of increasingly capable systems. Figuring out how to make a new technology safe for the first time isn't easy.”The final prong of Brockman’s lecture was to mention that “the future is going to be harder than the past. We need to keep elevating our safety work to match the stakes of each new model.”He further intimated that the company wasn’t following the big tech prescription of moving fast and breaking things. “As we build in this direction, we're not sure yet when we’ll reach our safety bar for releases, and it’s ok if that pushes out release timelines.”Sam Altman, co founder and CEO, kept his message short but did mention that he’d have more to say on the subject in the coming days:“He's right.” Altman posted, referring to Leike’s comments, adding “we have a lot more to do; we are committed to doing it.”Related: Reddit shares jump after-hours on OpenAI data-sharing deal

Funding Wrap: Polymarket gets backing from Vitalik Buterin, Founders Fund in $70M raise - Blockworks


This week’s funding was led by the betting platform Polymarket, which disclosed a whopping $70 million raised from two separate rounds. 
The announcement was slightly unusual in that it revealed its Series B raise while also revealing a previously undisclosed Series A round.
The Series A — which raised $25 million — was led by General Catalyst, with Airbnb’s Joe Gebbia and Polychain also participating.
The Series B raised $45 million, and saw participation from Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum (like he needs an introduction at this point though), with Founders Fund leading the round.

In the announcement, which took place earlier this week, Founders Fund partner Joey Krug offered an inside scoop on his company’s interest in the prediction market platform.
“Internally at Founders Fund, we developed a habit of checking Polymarket at times of breaking news. The tangible benefits of using Polymarket as a complement to consuming news on social and mainstream media was obvious. It became clear to us that Polymarket was the winner in this market,” he said.
Trading on Polymarket is prohibited in the US, though anyone can view the forecasts. But the funding announcement does come as the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission proposed a new rule to ban derivatives on election bets (and potentially other events). 
Polymarket does currently allow people to place bets on potential winners of the presidential election. Currently, former President Donald Trump has the lead with 51%. President Joe Biden is a close second at 42%. Roughly $127 million has been placed on potential election winners.

In the distance, a unicorn earns its horn
Decentralized identity project Humanity Protocol announced a $30 million seed round led by Kingsway Capital. The Worldcoin competitor, which uses palm recognition technology instead of iris-scanning software, emerged from stealth back in February. 
The round, announced Wednesday, saw participation from Animoca Brands, Blockchain.com, Hashed and Shima Capital, among others. 
Humanity Protocol previously announced a fundraising round, saying that it received funds from 20 crypto native venture capitalists. 
The raise puts the protocol’s valuation at $1 billion, officially making it a crypto unicorn. 
“As an advocate for true digital property rights, I’m very passionate about ensuring that users’ digital identities remain secure and protected. Traditional proof-of-personhood methods often come with drawbacks, whether they’re too invasive, complicated or cumbersome,” Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu said in a statement.
Other notable funding news

Subquid raised $17.5 million in “recent rounds” that included investments from Hypersphere, Zee Prime, CFG, Lattice and Blockchange.
Param Labs, a gaming platform, raised $7 million round in a round led by Animoca Brands. Delphi Ventures and Cypher Labs participated in the round. 
Zeta Market announced a $5 million round led by Electric Capital.

Ethereum Researcher Justin Drake Has Joined EigenLayer


Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake revealed that he became an advisor to the EigenFoundation, an independent non-profit focused on the restaking protocol EigenLayer.
In an extensive May 19 post on social media platform X, Drake revealed the extent of the relationship with the project and how he plans to operate.
EigenLayer Gets New Advisor

The Ethereum researcher explained that he took the job because he felt he “did too little too late with regard to liquid staking,” and this was “an opportunity to not repeat the mistake with restaking.” So, after an extensive consultation period that exceeded a year, he accepted the new role at EigenLayer. 
His new role would entail focusing on restaking risks, and his default public stance would be critical of EigenLayer. However, he promised to make his criticism constructive and advocate for mitigating risks like the erosion of solo validators and the intersubjective overloading of Ethereum consensus.
Drake also dismissed concerns that EigenLayer might be systematically bribing or corrupting the Ethereum Foundation (EF). He noted that the EF is a large organization with over 300 people, making it unlikely for EigenLayer to influence.

“To my knowledge, three EFers have a formal relationship with EigenLayer entities: one as an early EigenLabs investor and two as recent EigenFoundation advisors. EFers are among the highest integrity people I know, and I don’t see the 1% of EFers formally involved with EigenLayer compromising their morals,” he added.

Meanwhile, his new role offers significant incentives that could run into “millions of dollars of tokens vesting over 3 years.” However, he plans to reinvest these proceeds within the Ethereum ecosystem.
Also, Drake emphasized that his commitment to the EigenLayer advisory role is rooted in its alignment with Ethereum’s interests. Any misalignment, he asserted, would result in the termination of the appointment.


“I pledge to reinject all advisorship proceeds towards worthy projects within the Ethereum ecosystem, either as investments or donations. I also stand ready to end the advisorship at any time, e.g. should EigenLayer go in a direction I deem to be against Ethereum’s interests,” Drake stated.

EigenLayer is a platform that enables users to re-stake their Ethereum to secure third-party networks. DeFiLlama data shows EigenLayer now has over $15 billion worth of total value locked (TVL) in the platform since its launch.

Despite its success, EigenLayer faces strong competition from rivals like Symbiotic, reportedly backed by the co-founders of the Ethereum liquid staking platform Lido.

Tornado Cash verdict has chilling implications for crypto industry

The conviction of Alexey Pertsev, a developer of coin-mixing protocol Tornado Cash, comes from a chilling interpretation of criminal liability likely to have wider ramifications for crypto.The Dutch court’s guilty verdict means Pertsev must now serve a sentence of five years and four months for money laundering through Tornado Cash. This is despite the fact that Pertsev had no direct involvement in the laundering itself.Andrew Balthazor, a litigator with the legal firm Holland and Knight, spoke with Cointelegraph to explain the implications of the verdict.“Mr. Pertsev’s conviction reinforces the views of several governments that software developers who make their software available to the public will be held liable for the foreseeable consequences of the public’s use of that software,” said Balthazor.“Under this theory of liability, it is no defense to disclaim knowledge of a specific criminal act or to point to the software’s technical limitations in preventing its misuse by criminal actors. [...] It is the developer’s responsibility to create mechanisms to reduce or prevent foreseeable criminal use of their software.”When asked if the governments taking that view included the U.S. Balthazor said, “Yes, that appears to be the position of the U.S. as demonstrated by the Tornado Cash indictments brought domestically by the DoJ - [Department of Justice].”This interpretation of liability significantly differs from how most understand it in the traditional sense. Natalia Latka, director of public policy and regulatory affairs at blockchain analysis firm Merkle Science, told Cointelegraph how the theory has progressed over time.“Historically, software developers were seen as neutral creators of tools and platforms, responsible for their technical functionality but not for how those tools were used,” said Latka.“This perspective largely stemmed from the idea that technology itself is neutral, and its use depends on the intentions of the users. This perspective has been shifting, especially with the rise of decentralized networks that challenge traditional regulatory frameworks.”Latka explained that developers “must now consider the legal implications and potential misuse of their creations.”Crypto understands impact of court decisionThe crypto community quickly grasped the importance of Pertsev’s trial, taking to social media to condemn the conviction.Source: Eléonore BlancEléonore Blanc, founder of CryptoCanal — the events firm behind the ETHDam conference in Amsterdam — took to X to discuss the implications of the trial on social media. She conducted a thought experiment to ask whether “Tornado Cash” could not just as easily be “any cryptocurrency of your choice.”Blanc told Cointelegraph why she found the case so concerning.“They’ve systematically disregarded all arguments from the defense,” she said. “As such, you can easily extrapolate and see how this specific court verdict could be interpreted at a larger scale to more use cases in the crypto industry.”Blanc went on to further personalize the ruling on X, stating, “As crypto builders, we are all Alexey. We keep fighting for him, his legacy and the cypherpunk values.”Fewture, another X community member, went on to consider what this model of liability would mean if it were applied outside the world of software development.Source: fewtureBalthazor argued that if community members instinctively knew how dangerous the ruling was for privacy, there would be further ramifications to consider.Risks to immutability and decentralizationThe first and most obvious casualty of the Tornado Cash ruling may be privacy, but this is not the only challenge stemming from the case. The immutability of the blockchain and smart contracts is also at risk.“This theory of liability renders immutable smart contracts highly risky for developers to make available to the public,” said Balthazor.“Reducing risks to developers may require publicly available programs be amendable so that software developers can respond to law enforcement or regulators’ requirements.”“For example, certain stablecoin issuers possess a feature allowing the stablecoin to blacklist blockchain addresses controlled by sanctioned entities. Failing to include such a feature would increase the risk to those issuers of their stablecoins being used by sanctioned entities,” he said.Balhazor concluded that the ruling “increases the risks associated with decentralized projects” because their “decentralized nature may make course corrections difficult due to the consensus needed to make major code or operational changes.”Turning the screwsWith Pertsev receiving such a punitive sentence, it’s understandable if blockchain developers are now nervous about potential legal action. Latka said that “compliance by design” will become “crucial for developers and organizations in the crypto space. This involves integrating regulatory compliance into the design and development process from the outset.”This is because “courts will assess whether developers knowingly created tools for illegal purposes or were willfully blind to their misuse, with evidence of intent or negligence significantly impacting legal outcomes.”But if developers have to sacrifice privacy, immutability and decentralization to protect themselves and make their protocols compliant by design, what will remain of blockchain?

Ethereum Foundation Staff Tied to EigenLayer, Disclosure Prompts Call for Risk Mitigation - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Three Ethereum Foundation staff members disclosed ties with EigenLayer entities, raising concerns over potential conflicts of interest.



Justin Ðrake, a prominent figure, may receive millions of dollars’ worth of tokens over three years as an advisor, sparking debate over transparency and accountability.



Despite affiliations, Ðrake pledges to maintain a critical stance on EigenLayer and advocates for constructive criticism and risk mitigation within the Ethereum community.




Justin Ðrake, a prominent figure within the Ethereum Foundation, revealed that three staff members have established formal ties with EigenLayer entities. 





Among these connections, one staff member served as an early investor in EigenLabs, while two others assumed roles as advisors for EigenFoundation.







The revelation comes amidst growing scrutiny surrounding potential conflicts of interest within the Ethereum ecosystem. With Ethereum being one of the largest and most influential blockchain platforms, any perceived conflicts or improprieties involving its key figures can have far-reaching implications.

Commitment to Transparency and Critical Advocacy





Of particular concern is the possibility of financial incentives influencing decision-making processes within the Ethereum Foundation. Ðrake’s disclosure revealed that he himself may receive millions of dollars worth of tokens over a three-year period as compensation for his advisory role with EigenLayer. While such arrangements are not inherently unusual within the cryptocurrency space, they do raise questions about transparency and accountability, especially when individuals holding influential positions are involved.



In response to these revelations, Ðrake has emphasized his commitment to maintaining transparency and addressing potential conflicts of interest. He asserts that his public stance will remain critical of EigenLayer, despite his formal relationship with the organization. Furthermore, he vows to strive for constructive criticism and advocate for risk mitigation measures within the Ethereum community.



Skepticism persists among some observers regarding the adequacy of these assurances. Critics argue that even with the best intentions, the inherent complexities of navigating personal interests alongside professional responsibilities in the cryptocurrency space can pose significant challenges.

Crypto price prediction: Floki, BitBot, Arweave



                    

                    Cryptocurrency prices did moderately well last week as investors embraced a risk-on sentiment in the financial market. Bitcoin jumped to above $67,000 for the first time in over a month while BitBot continued its token sale, raising millions of dollars. This article focuses on BitBot, Floki, and Arweave.
Arweave price forecast
Arweave is one of the biggest players in the web 3 industry with a market cap of over $3 billion. It is disrupting the online storage industry by providing permanent storage solutions for developers. Developers can also launch smart contracts that handle transactions within seconds using its Warp technology.
Arweave’s price has done well in the past few weeks as it defied the gravity that we have seen in the crypto industry. It jumped to a high of $50 last week, its highest level since January 2022. It has soared by over 1,150% from its lowest point in 2023. Most recently, it has jumped for four straight weeks.
Turning to the weekly chart, we see that the AR token price has been in a strong bull run in the past few weeks. It has remained comfortably above the 50-week and 25-week Exponential Moving Averages (EMA).
It is now hovering at $48, its previous highest point this year, meaning that it is forming a double-top pattern, a popular bearish sign. Arweave is also nearing the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level.
Therefore, while Arweave’s token price outlook is bullish, buyers must now move above the crucial resistance level at $49.70. If this happens, the next point to watch will be the 61.8% retracement point at $60.

Floki price prediction
Like Arweave, the price of Floki has defied gravity in the past few weeks. It jumped to a high of $0.0002290 last week, its highest swing since April 2nd. At its highest point this month, the token was up by 105% from its lowest point on April 13th. 
Floki Inu has now pulled back and moved below the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. It has also remained above the 50-day and 25-day moving averages and the lower side of the Andrews Pitchfork tool. 
Therefore, the outlook for Floki is neutral for now. A break below the pitchfork tool will point to more downside, with the next point to watch being at $0.00018. The alternative is where it rebounds and retests last week’s high of $0.00022.

BitBot analysis
The other notable cryptocurrency is BitBot, which has already raised over $3.5 million from global investors. BitBot is a company that seeks to change the trading industry by leveraging the concepts of technical analysis and artificial intelligence (AI).
It will be a comprehensive trading bot that anyone can use to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The app will be distributed in Telegram, a leading social media platform with over 900 million users globally. 
Unlike other trading bots, BitBot will have several important features. First, it will be a non-custodial bot, meaning that the developers will not have access to your funds. Second, holders of the $BITBOT token will have access to additional staking rewards. Third, these holders will take part in its governance. You can buy the BitBot token here.

PEPE: Profit-taking sparks price fall? Investors in profit reach 92% - AMBCrypto



The meme coin was down by more than 6% in the last 24 hours. 
Market indicators and metrics hinted at a further price decline. 

Pepe [PEPE] had a major setback on the 18th of May as the meme coin price witnessed a steep decline. A check of its metrics pointed out a few possible reasons behind this bearish price action. 
Let’s take a look at the entire picture. 
Are PEPE investors taking profits?
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that PEPE’s price started to decline sharply in the last few hours. Because of that, the meme coin’s daily price dropped by more than 6%.
 At the time of writing, it was trading at $0.000009426 with a market capitalization of over $3.9 billion, making it the 27th largest crypto. 
AMBCrypto’s look at IntoTheBlock’s data revealed a possible reason behind this. We found that over 92% of PEPE investors were in profit. 
This might have motivated investors to sell their holdings, in turn pushing the meme coin’s price down. 
To see whether that was the case, AMBCrypto then analyzed Santiment’s data. As per our analysis, the meme coin’s exchange inflow spiked multiple times last week. 
It was interesting to note that after a dip, the meme coin’s Supply on Exchanges started to increase. Meanwhile, its Supply outside of Exchanges started to decline on the 18th of May, signaling a sell-off. 
Moreover, after a sharp rise on the 14th of May, the meme coin’s supply held by top addresses dropped slightly. 
This suggested that a few whales also sold their holdings, possibly causing the meme coin’s price to plummet. 
Source: Santiment
PEPE’s troubles aren’t over 
The dark days might continue for the meme coin, as few other metrics gave away a bearish notion. 
For instance, PEPE’s Social Volume declined sharply over the last week, reflecting a dip in the meme coin’s popularity. On top of that, its Weighted Sentiment also sank over the last few days. 
So, bearish sentiment around the meme coin was high, indicating that investors were expecting its price to go down further. 
Source: Santiment
Like metrics, several market indicators also supported the bears. The meme coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a decline. At press time, the RSI had a value of 58.7.
 Likewise, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also went down, indicating that the chances of the bearish price trend continuing were high. 

Realistic or not, here’s PEPE’s market cap in BTC’s terms   

As per our analysis, PEPE’s price was still well above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
 Therefore, if the price decline continues, the meme coin’s value might drop to its 20-day EMA, which might act as a support.

Wells Fargo Accused of 'Aiding and Abetting' Alleged $300,000,000 Ponzi Scheme With More Than 1,000 Victims: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A new lawsuit accuses Wells Fargo of monitoring “both sides” of an alleged $300 million Ponzi scheme and doing nothing to stop it.
Plaintiffs for the lawsuit accuse the US bank of unjust enrichment, negligence, aiding and abetting fraud and breaching fiduciary duties, reports the Sun Sentinel.










In July of 2021, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) filed a complaint against insurance company Seeman Holtz for multiple violations of securities laws. The complaint alleges that Seeman Holtz engaged in the sale of unregistered securities after issuing $300 million in promissory notes that were supposedly backed by life settlement policies.
But the OFR says Seeman Holtz used the funds from new investors to pay off older investors to create the illusion of profitability. At the time, Seeman Holtz set up accounts at Wells Fargo that held funds from new and old investors.
According to the lawsuit, Wells Fargo allowed Seeman Holtz to redirect money from new investor accounts to accounts designed to hold old investor funds.
Plaintiffs say that “Wells Fargo knew, or should have known, of the Ponzi scheme and extensive fraud” because the banking titan monitored “both sides of the scheme.”
The lawsuit says the Ponzi scheme fleeced over 1,000 victims, including seniors and investors who lost their entire nest egg after being promised annual returns of as much as 18%.
“Most of the investors in the notes have lost their entire investment which, in some instances, was their life’s savings. Many of the investors have no other income, subsist almost exclusively off Social Security benefits, and are now struggling desperately to find the means to sustain their livelihood.”
The suit is asking Wells Fargo to return all income and fees received from the accounts involved in the scheme on top of interest and other costs.
Wells Fargo has not yet responded to the lawsuit and says it has no comment.

Kraken to keep USDT in the E.U. despite regulatory challenges


Despite regulatory challenges, Kraken, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has no plan to delist Tether’s USD stablecoin (USDT).
On May 19, Mark Greenberg, Global Head of Kraken’s Asset Growth & Management Business, communicated the company’s stance in a post on X amid rumors of a possible delisting. Greenberg recognized the demand for USDT from European customers, saying they would “look at all options” to keep it listed.

However, the cryptocurrency executive warned that the company will follow all legal requirements, which have yet to be defined in Europe. Therefore, delisting USDT is still possible in the near future despite Kraken’s desire to keep it.


Delisting speculations started on May 17, following a Bloomberg report stating Kraken was “actively reviewing” Tether’s status under MiCa rules.
Kraken plans to relist delisted cryptocurrencies from Germany
Recently, Kraken announced a new partnership with DLT Finance for its operations in Germany. As a result, the company removed dozens of cryptocurrencies not supported by its new partner, creating uncertainty for the region.
On that note, Mark Greenberg commented in response to a user, stating they plan to “relist some of these assets soon.”

OKX delisted Tether’s USDT in Europe due to upcoming regulation
In March, crypto exchange OKX delisted Tether’s USDT stablecoin for users in the European Union and the European Economic Area (EEA), citing a focus on expanding euro-denominated liquidity in the region. OKX limited spot crypto trading to USDC and euro pairs, while USDT could only be traded against USDC and euro.
Nevertheless, the exchange stated that the decision would only impact a small subset of its user base. Moreover, it had recently expanded its product offering in the EEA by introducing various euro fiat onramps and euro pairs. USDT remained available for EEA-based users to deposit, withdraw, and trade on over-the-counter (OTC) markets.
The move by OKX could be a sign of upcoming regulatory challenges for USDT in the region as the European Union prepares to implement its comprehensive digital asset regulatory framework called MiCA later this year.
In particular, the new rules will require stablecoin issuers to be regulated as electronic money institutions, potentially making many stablecoins currently offered in Europe illegal if they are not authorized and regulated as e-money transmitters. Circle, the issuer behind USDC and EURC, has already taken steps to comply with the upcoming regulations by applying for an electronic money institution license in the E.U.

ChatGPT Compares: Which Meme Coin Will Perform Best This Year


																TL;DR

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are top meme coin contenders for 2024, with DOGE benefiting from endorsements and a strong community, while SHIB has shown significant yearly gains.
ChatGPT also outlined the chances of Pepe (PEPE), dogwifhat (WIF), and Bonk Inu (BONK) due to their recent price rallies and solid support base.


DOGE and SHIB Are Among the Contenders
The meme coin sector has captured the attention of industry participants in the past several months, with numerous assets experiencing substantial price surges. The niche witnessed the progress of some recently launched tokens and the success of others that have been part of the industry for years.
Considering the huge interest in the topic, we decided to ask ChatGPT which meme coin will perform the best in 2024. The AI-powered chatbot started its estimation with the leaders in terms of market capitalization – Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.
Despite being created as a joke in 2013, DOGE saw a remarkable rally in the past few years, reaching an all-time high of over $0.70 in 2021. Currently, it hovers around the $0.15 mark, which represents a substantial plunge from the peak but also a 100% increase compared to the figures observed in May 2023.

The asset has a devoted community, while endorsements from high-profile figures like Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk are beneficial for its performance. Not long ago, the EV giant officially integrated DOGE as a payment option on its website.




Shiba Inu (SHIB) – known as the Dogecoin killer – has also made great strides. Its price is up over 180% yearly, while a recent study estimated that it has the strongest supporter base in the meme coin realm.

Its future success relies on multiple factors, such as the further development of its layer-2 blockchain solution – Shibarium, its burning mechanism, adoption levels, and overall investor interest. 
It is worth noting that the L2 network recently underwent two major upgrades aimed at improving user experience and enabling compatibility with popular wallets, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. Those interested in learning more about Shibarium, feel free to take a look at our dedicated video below:

The Chances of the Rivals
ChatGPT continued its prediction with Pepe (PEPE), noting its solid community and recent price rally. As CryptoPotato reported, the frog-themed meme coin hit a new all-time high on May 15, with its market cap nearing the $5 billion milestone.
Subsequently, the chatbot claimed that dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk Inu (BONK) also have chances to finish 2024 as the niche’s top performers. Both assets are built on the Solana blockchain and have become sensations in the past months. 
WIF gained support from prominent industry participants such as Arthur Hayes, while fans of the token recently raised $650,000 to put its logo on the Sphere – a famous entertainment arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.
“WIF has garnered a strong community following and significant attention on social media, which are crucial for the success of meme coins. Its current market cap and trading volume indicate a solid interest from investors,” ChatGPT stated. 
At one point this year, WIF’s market cap spiked to almost $5 billion, becoming the third-biggest in the cohort. Currently, it is placed fourth, trailing behind PEPE.

BONK’s success has been just as impressive. Launched in December 2022, it started making the headlines towards the end of 2023 after an exponential price rally. Its uptick was fueled by significant hype from investors and support from leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance, Bybit, and Coinbase are among the leaders allowing trading services with BONK. 
According to ChatGPT, the meme coin may advance even more before the end of 2024 as long as it benefits from the potential growth of the Solana ecosystem.

Renowned crypto trader's last insights before a 'couple of weeks' break


The cryptocurrency market led by Bitcoin (BTC) rose this week, but the resurgence stalled momentarily, with the maiden digital asset appearing to consolidate at around the $67,000 level. 
Overall, the market remains on edge regarding the next movement, especially for Bitcoin and altcoins. In this line, crypto trading expert Credible Crypto (Credibull), in a YouTube video posted on May 19, shared insights and outlook for several digital assets before what he termed taking a break. Below are some of the cryptocurrencies highlighted by the expert. 
Bitcoin (BTC)
The analyst noted that if Bitcoin is to experience a significant downside move, it should happen from the main resistance area, currently around $71,000. He identified $62,300 to $63,300 as a potential bounce zone, with $59,000 being the ideal target if this area fails.

He elaborated on the factors to watch for to determine Bitcoin’s next move. Two key indicators include an impulsive move off the lows and the behavior of open interest (OI). Credibull noted the absence of an impulsive move and a concerning ramp-up in OI, suggesting potential for a corrective move rather than a bullish breakout.
The analyst warned that if Bitcoin fails to break through this resistance level convincingly and OI remains high, it could lead to a significant price correction, possibly back to the $59,000 level.

“I’m cautious right now. I’m not super bullish as we push up into major resistance with a ramp-up in OI back to the levels that we were at before we broke down,” he said. 

Dogecoin (DOGE)
Transitioning to altcoins, Credibull expressed interest in shorting Dogecoin (DOGE). He highlighted that his primary area of interest for shorting Dogecoin lies around the $0.18 mark. He explained that this level offers an ideal risk-to-reward ratio for short positions.
The analyst called for patience, stating that he would not initiate a short position until Dogecoin reached the $0.18 zone. He acknowledged the possibility of several scenarios playing out before this level is hit.

For instance, Dogecoin could experience a pullback, potentially moving down and bouncing back up to the short zone. Alternatively, Dogecoin might directly ascend to the short zone without a significant Bitcoin pullback.
Regardless of the immediate movements, Credibull stressed that his strategy is not driven by emotions but by technical analysis and risk management. He pointed out that entering a short position below the $0.18 mark could expose traders to unnecessary risk, especially if the market experiences a bullish breakout.
Solana (SOL)
For Solana (SOL), the analyst identified vital resistance levels and potential shorting opportunities. He mentioned that Solana has room for a 5% to 10% upside. The expert pinpointed a move above the previous highs above $180 as the optimal short entry. 
He expects a rejection at this level, followed by a significant move down to the range lows, around $115. This represents approximately a 35% move from the current levels to the downside.

Credibull also highlighted the confluence of resistance levels on the SOL/USD and SOL/BTC charts, reinforcing his bearish outlook. He pointed out that both pairs are hitting key resistance zones, making them prime candidates for short positions with a favorable risk-to-reward ratio.
Chainlink (LINK)
In his analysis for Chainlink (LINK), Credibull noted that the token has been on a prolonged upward trend for almost a year, with only two months of correction, which makes a deeper retracement likely.
Credibull identified a point of breakdown and a subsequent range between $16 and $12 that LINK has established. Currently, LINK is pushing into an area of resistance around $18, making it an ideal spot for a short position. He emphasized the importance of either shorting directly into this resistance or waiting for a structural shift and falling back into the range to confirm the short.

One of Credibull’s critical indicators for the LINK short is the massive rise in open interest during the recent push to the upside. This increase suggests that many leveraged players have entered the market, creating a potential for significant downside if these positions start to unwind. 
He identified a target move back down to around $11.96, which, from the current levels, represents a 27% to 30% move to the downside.
Dogwifhat (WIF) 
Credibull noted that while WIF has broken down from a lower level, there is still ample downside liquidity, suggesting the possibility of a fakeout after consolidation. He cautioned about initiating a short position on WIF until it recovers further and potentially reclaims higher levels.

One key reason Credibull is hesitant to short the meme coin at its current level is the risk-reward ratio. He emphasized the importance of waiting for rejection confirmation at resistance before considering a short position. 
The expert also highlighted the significance of shorting at extreme areas, such as the range highs, to minimize risk and maximize potential returns.
Overall, despite the technical indicators, the mentioned cryptocurrencies are highly susceptible to general market sentiment.

Important Statements from Vitalik Buterin, Wrote About Ethereum's Problems and Solutions - "Traditional Finance Could Revive If It Fails" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin addressed criticism and concerns regarding Ethereum's centralization in a recent blog post.
The article covers three key topics: MEV (miner or maximum extractable value), liquid staking, and hardware costs involved in running an independent node.


Buterin acknowledged that these concerns are widely expressed and admitted that he has had them himself on many occasions. However, he also suggested that these problems may not be as insurmountable as some believe.
MEV refers to the financial advantage advanced node operators can gain by reordering transactions within a block. Buterin highlighted two approaches to combating MEV: minimization and quarantine. Minimization involves reducing MEV through smart protocol design such as CowSwap, while quarantining attempts to reduce or eliminate MEV through in-protocol techniques.





Buterin warned that MEV quarantine, while appealing, carries centralization risks. “If developers had the power to completely exclude transactions from a block, there are attacks that could occur quite easily,” he wrote. Despite this, Buterin expressed support for founders working on MEV quarantine through concepts such as transaction inclusion lists, which prevent developers from excluding transactions entirely.

Buterin also touched on the issue of individual Ethereum staking. Given the complexity, hardware requirements, and need for at least 32 ETH to run a standalone Ethereum node, most stakers choose to stake with Coinbase or a decentralized intermediary like Lido or RocketPool.


While Buterin acknowledged the progress made in reducing the cost and complexity of running an individual node, he suggested more could be done, such as reducing the time to withdraw staked ETH or lowering the 32 ETH minimum requirement for individual staking.
Buterin concluded his words by warning that wrong solutions could lead Ethereum to the path of centralization and revive the traditional financial system.

Find Out 3 Major Token Unlocks of Next Week


Token unlock involves releasing tokens that were previously blocked under fundraising terms. Projects carefully schedule these releases to avoid market pressure and prevent a drop in token prices.
However, factors like lack of liquidity or early investor profit-taking can significantly impact an asset’s dynamics. Here are three major token unlocks to watch next week.
Pyth Network (PYTH)

Unlock date: May 20
Number of tokens unlocked: 2.13 billion PYTH
Current circulating supply: 1.5 billion PYTH


Pyth Network is a decentralized oracle that supplies real-time financial market data to blockchain applications. It gathers high-quality pricing information from various sources, including trading firms and exchanges. The project aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of data used in smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.
The PYTH token has a maximum supply of 10 billion. On May 20, the project will unlock 2.13 billion tokens, which exceeds the current circulating supply. Approximately 800 million PYTH will go to private sale participants and publishers, with the remainder allocated for protocol development and ecosystem growth.
Crypto community members have polarized opinions on how the unlock will affect PYTH price. Some believe the altcoin is headed for a significant collapse, while others are confident that tokenomics design will allow it to hold its ground.

“Pyth unlock worth $910M is on 20th May. 141.67% of current supply is being unlocked. AEVO dumped 25% after the unlock. Most of PYTH holders have staked so they can’t sell their bags. Regardless i am looking for shorting setups,” one crypto trader noted.

There is Some Good News From India, Known For Its Anti-Cryptocurrency Attitude - Bitcoin Sistemi

In a significant development, India's market watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), has recommended that multiple regulators oversee cryptocurrency trading, according to documents seen by Reuters.
This is the strongest indication that some authorities in the country are open to the use of private virtual assets.


SEBI's stance contrasts with that of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which argues that private digital currencies pose a macroeconomic risk. Both sets of documents were presented to a government panel responsible for making policy for the finance ministry to consider.
India has taken a tough stance on cryptocurrencies since 2018, when its central bank banned lenders and other financial intermediaries from dealing with crypto users or exchanges. However, this move was later overturned by the Supreme Court.





In 2021, the government prepared a bill to ban private cryptocurrencies, but it has not yet been implemented. As G20 president last year, India called for a global framework to regulate such assets.

RBI continues to support banning stablecoins. A source with direct knowledge of the panel's discussions said the panel plans to finalize its report as early as June.


SEBI, however, has opposed a single unified regulator for digital assets, recommending that different regulators oversee activities linked to cryptocurrencies falling within their purview. He proposed that his agency oversee cryptocurrencies in the form of securities and new offerings called Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and issue licenses for stock market-related products.
This approach mirrors that in the United States, where securities and crypto exchanges fall under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SEBI has also suggested that crypto assets backed by fiat currencies can be regulated by the RBI and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) should regulate insurance and pension-related virtual assets.






SEBI also recommended that the complaints of investors trading in cryptocurrencies be resolved under India's Consumer Protection Act.
In its presentations, the RBI had warned of fiscal policy risks, including potential tax evasion and reliance on voluntary compliance in decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) activities in cryptocurrencies. He also highlighted the potential loss of “seigniorage” income, the profit a central bank makes from money production.
Although the RBI's 2018 orders were challenged and overturned by the Supreme Court, the central bank asked financial institutions to strictly comply with stringent anti-money laundering and foreign exchange rules and completely excluded cryptocurrencies from India's formal financial system.

However, the trade gradually increased and in 2022 the government introduced a tax on crypto transactions in India to discourage such transactions.

Crypto Institutions Gobble Up Billions In Bitcoin ETFs, Stockpiling 250,000 BTC - Details


								The tides are turning in the cryptocurrency world, with institutional investors making a big splash in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) while retail investors seem content to bob on the sidelines. A recent report by IntotheBlock paints a picture of a two-tiered market, where hedge funds and even pensions are accumulating Bitcoin through ETFs, but the average investor remains cautious.

Institutional Investors Set Sail With Bitcoin ETFs
The launch of Bitcoin ETFs on the New York Stock Exchange in early 2024 was a watershed moment, finally opening the floodgates for institutional money to enter the crypto market. This has been a boon for Bitcoin whales – investors with significant holdings – who have been snapping up large amounts of the cryptocurrency through these new financial vehicles.
IntotheBlock’s data shows that these whales have collectively amassed an additional 250,000 Bitcoins, bringing their coffers back to levels last seen before the FTX collapse in 2023.
Source: IntoTheBlock
Hedge funds, long expected to be the driving force behind institutional adoption, have lived up to the hype. Financial giants like Millennium Management have reportedly invested billions in Bitcoin ETFs, signaling their confidence in the future of the cryptocurrency. Public pensions are also getting into the game, with the state of Wisconsin making a splash with a $160 million investment in Bitcoin ETFs.
US ETF Frenzy Fizzles, But The Voyage Continues
While the initial reception for US Bitcoin ETFs was euphoric, with record-breaking inflows in January propelling the entire crypto market upwards, the party seems to be slowing down. Experts believe the early surge may have been fueled by a limited number of enthusiastic institutional adopters. Inflows have tapered off in recent weeks, suggesting a wait-and-see approach from some investors.

Across the Pacific, the recent launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong met with a muted response. The first day of trading saw a mere $12.7 million in volume, a far cry from the $4.6 billion recorded by US ETFs on their debut. This lukewarm reception suggests that the Asian market may not be as eager to embrace the crypto just yet.
Retail Investors Drop Anchor, Unconvinced By The Hype
Adding another layer to the complex story is the apparent lack of enthusiasm from retail investors. The report highlights a significant decrease in the creation of new Bitcoin addresses, a metric often used to gauge retail participation. This suggests that many individual investors are staying on the sidelines, unconvinced by the recent surge or wary of the volatility associated with cryptocurrency.

The reasons for this hesitancy could be manifold. The FTX collapse may have left some investors with a bitter taste in their mouths, and the overall market correction in early 2024 could be prompting caution. Additionally, the complexities of ETFs, coupled with the novelty of cryptocurrency investing for some, might be creating a wait-and-see attitude among retail investors.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $67,032, up 0.7% in the last 24 hours, and sustained an impressive 11.0% price increase in the last week, data from Coingecko shows.

Roaring Kitty Goes MIA as GameStop Dumps on Retail Investors | Cryptopolitan

GameStop, the video game retail giant, is hitting the market hard with plans to sell up to 45 million new shares. This decision came hot on the heels of a major stock price jump, catalyzed by the unexpected comeback of day trader Keith Gill (AKA Roaring Kitty).  GameStop is bracing for a drop in first-quarter net sales compared to the previous year. With shares closing 19.9% lower at $22.21 in New York, the potential revenue from these shares could hit around $1 billion if fully capitalized.GameStop Shares New Strategy for SharesOn Friday, GameStop revealed this strategy in a filing to the US securities regulator, alongside some sobering preliminary financial results.Last week was nothing short of a rollercoaster for GameStop’s stock, which saw an almost fourfold increase to a Tuesday peak of $64.83—the highest since mid-2021. By week’s end, GameStop reported a 27.2% rise in share price.However, the company acknowledged that these dramatic price fluctuations seem disconnected from its actual business performance or operational results.Source: TradingView GameStop’s anticipated net sales are set between $872 million and $892 million, marking a decline of at least 27% from last year and falling short of the $1.05 billion analysts had projected.Expected net losses could range from $27 million to $37 million, improving slightly from the previous year’s $50.5 million loss.AMC Joins GameStop in Market SurgeThe meme stock frenzy wasn’t limited to GameStop. AMC Entertainment, another key player from the 2021 stock surge, also capitalized on market trends.Related: Could Gamestop & Amc Pumps Spark a New Meme Coin Season?Last week, AMC entered an agreement to exchange nearly $164 million of subordinated debt due in 2026 for approximately 23.3 million newly issued shares, valued at about $7.33 each. Despite closing at $4.40, AMC’s stock experienced a 51.2% increase over the week.Investors Scramble as Shares FluctuateKeith Gill’s posts sparked a significant rally in GameStop shares. However, he has gone silent on Twitter for nearly 48 hours since then.This sudden disappearance has left investors and followers speculating about his next move, especially as the stock faces volatile swings.Also Read: Roaring Kitty Makes an Iconic Comeback – Gamestop Is on Fire!After the initial surge that brought GameStop shares to unprecedented heights, Roaring Kitty’s silence has raised concerns among investors about potential “pump and dump” schemes. Allegations have surfaced suggesting that Kitty may have artificially inflated the stock price only to profit from its peak, leaving many to hold depreciating assets.The rapid rise and fall of the stock highlight the risky nature of investing based on social media trends, where the line between influence and manipulation can often become blurred. Many investors who joined the frenzy, attracted by the potential for quick profits, now face significant losses.The lesson is simple. Jumping into highly volatile stocks on the back of internet hype—without solid fundamentals to back the investment—can be a precarious venture.

Peter Schiff Tired of Traders Accusing Him of Using Bitcoin to Chase Clout

Peter Schiff, a gold enthusiast and trader, has never shied away from encouraging stock investors to choose gold over Bitcoin. However, his position has led to criticism from the crypto community.Today, Peter Schiff took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify his position on using Bitcoin to grow his influence. He said:“I’m tired of people claiming I’m only against #Bitcoin to generate social media engagement. That’s ridiculous.”Peter Schiff Does Not Need Bitcoin to Grow InfluenceRenowned financial expert Peter Schiff has once again stirred the crypto market by refuting the notion that he uses BTC to chase clout. Schiff, known for his bearish views on crypto, based his latest remarks on BTC’s recent performance against silver and gold, drawing attention to the sharp difference. However, the crypto community will not buy that stand. One X user by the name @AndersonJoby  told Schiff: “Peter, if that’s true than never bring up $BTC again. But it’s not, so you will. By going anti Bitcoin that is what drives your engagement and you know this. Nobody believes anything you say lol. You have become the poster child for the $BTC community by being wrong over and over and over again about it.”Also Read: Is This the End of Bitcoin’s Bull Run? Peter Schiff Thinks SoSchiff says that silver has gone up 21% since April, while Bitcoin has only gone up 2%. He says that this poor performance is proof that Bitcoin is about to die. On the other hand, Bitcoin supporters say that Schiff only uses short-term data to back his story. Bitcoin has gone up by almost 60% so far this year, while silver has only increased by 14.46%. This contrast drives ongoing arguments between people who support traditional assets and people who support digital currencies.On today’s X post, Peter Schiff adds: “I think Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, a literal blockchain letter […] If Bitcoin pumpers stop claiming Bitcoin is digital gold then I won’t need to post about it.”To that end, one X user added: “Oh come on, we both know Bitcoin’s been the star of the show. You get the whole debasement thing, right? And let’s be honest, you’re kicking yourself for not hopping on the Bitcoin train ten years ago.” The Crypto Market over the WeekendHistorically, the crypto weekend is known to come with negative sentiments. To that end, the market has had rather an opposite sentiment weekend. Currently, the value of Bitcoin stands at $66,979.31, reflecting a slight 0.3% increase over the past hour and a 0.1% increase since yesterday. Today, the global crypto market cap stands at $2.53 trillion, with a slight decrease of 0.43% in the last 24 hours and a significant increase of 115.88% compared to a year ago. Currently, BTC’s market cap stands at $1.32 trillion, indicating a Bitcoin dominance of 52.02%. Meanwhile, the stablecoin market cap stands at $162 billion, representing a 6.39% share of the overall crypto market cap.Also Read: Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024-2030: Will BTC Price Surpass $100K Post-Halving?Today, the value of Ethereum (ETH) stands at $3,078.71, reflecting a slight 0.4% increase compared to an hour ago.

Cardano network activity on the rise, but will it be enough for ADA? - AMBCrypto



Activity on the Cardano network surged significantly over the last few days.
Interest in Cardano’s NFT sector waned.

Cardano [ADA] has been one of the major networks that has been consistently growing in terms of development activity.
Despite the high number of developments occurring on the Cardano network, it failed to attract a large number of addresses to Cardano.
A rise in activity
However, in the last few days, there was a resurgence in activity observed on the Cardano network. It was seen that the number of daily active addresses on the network has grown above the 30,000 mark.
Coupled with the rise in active addresses, the number of transactions occurring on the network also grew. However, the surge in active addresses wasn’t as significant.
On the 10th of March, the number of active addresses on the network had soared to more than 60,000, double what they were at the time of writing.
A positive indicator of the Cardano ecosystem being healthy would be if the network sees the same amount of activity in the next few days.
Source: Artemis
Due to the rising activity on the Cardano network, the TVL (total value locked) on the protocol also surged, implying that interest in Cardano’s DeFi sector had grown.
If Cardano can continue to attract users to its DeFi dApps, its ecosystem could have a shot at a revival.
Source: Artemis
Some challenges ahead
However, the waning interest in the NFT sector may add some hindrance to Cardano’s recent growth.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of TapTools’ data revealed that the floor price of popular Cardano NFT collections such as EarthNode, Book.io and The Ape Society witnessed a significant deduction.
Moreover, the volume at which these NFTs were trading also plummeted materially.
If Cardano’s growth is driven solely by its DeFi sector and other sectors such as NFTs get left behind, it may cause problems for its ecosystem in the long run.

Even though interest in Cardano NFTs was waning, the interest in ADA had remained high. Over the past week, the price of ADA grew by 8.11%.
Additionally, the velocity at which ADA was trading had also grown significantly during this period.

Bitcoin (BTC) Mirroring Pre-Parabolic Rally That Led to Over 1,200% Gains in 2017, According to Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin’s (BTC) current market structure looks similar to 2017, just before its massive 1,200% rally to its previous record high of $20,000, according to widely followed crypto analyst TechDev.
The pseudonymous analyst shares with his 450,000 followers on the social media platform X a chart that suggests the current market cycle has been strikingly reminiscent of the 2017 Bitcoin bull run.










TechDev’s chart highlights that both bear markets bottomed out during the crash of two major crypto exchanges, followed by repeated rallies and consolidation phases.
“The more things change, the more they stay the same.”
Source: TechDev/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that BTC is currently in a consolidation phase similar to 2017 when it was trading at around $1,500 before a parabolic run to a cycle high of $20,000.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $67,060.
The analyst also looks at Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI), which aims to gauge the momentum of an asset. According to TechDev, Bitcoin has historically topped out when its RSI reaches the top of a long-term channel, which has not yet occurred.
“You’re in the green zone. Don’t waste it.”
Source: TechDev/X
TechDev is also looking at the OTHERS chart, which tracks the market cap of all crypto excluding the top 10 digital assets and stablecoins. Specifically, he’s looking at the chart’s stochastic RSI, moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and logarithmic Bollinger Band indicator.
The MACD is traditionally used to pinpoint reversals based on the convergence or divergence of moving averages, and the Bollinger Bands are meant to identify periods of impending sharp price movements based on volatility contraction.
According to the analyst, OTHERS, which is often used to gauge the strength of altcoins, has reached a “max compression” zone, suggesting that a big move to the upside is on the horizon. He also notes that the setup coincides with the return of “Roaring Kitty,” the leader of the movement that pumped the price of Gamestop (GME) in 2021.
“Roaring Kitty returns as this alt setup reappears.
There are no coincidences.”

Brandt Mocks Schiff's Non-Stop Attacks on Bitcoin, Schiff Insists He Is Just Being 'Honest' | Cryptoglobe


                                
Peter Schiff, an American economist, financial broker, and author, is renowned for his bearish outlook on the U.S. economy and his accurate prediction of the 2008 financial crisis. Born on 23 March 1963 in New Haven, Connecticut, Schiff holds a degree in finance and accounting from the University of California, Berkeley. Starting his career as a stockbroker, he later co-founded Euro Pacific Capital, where he currently serves as CEO and Chief Global Strategist. An advocate of the Austrian School of economics, Schiff is a vocal critic of monetary stimulus policies and a well-known skeptic of Bitcoin, often comparing it to the tulip mania bubble. He prefers investments in gold and other hard assets and has authored several books, including “Crash Proof: How to Profit from the Coming Economic Collapse” and “The Real Crash: America’s Coming Bankruptcy.”



On 2 April 2024, when Bitcoin was trading at around $65,469, Schiff took to the social media platform X to comment on the market. He noted that gold had risen over 1% to hit a new record high, while silver had surged nearly 4%. He emphasized that silver still had significant room to grow to reach a new record high and remarked that Bitcoin had fallen almost 6% that day. Schiff provocatively stated that silver is the new Bitcoin, dubbing it “Bitcoin 2.0.”



Fast forward to 18 May 2024, with Bitcoin trading at around $67,613, Schiff revisited his earlier post. He highlighted that since 2 April, silver had increased by over 21%, while Bitcoin’s gains were less than 2%, asserting that silver offered more than ten times the return compared to Bitcoin. He declared, “Bitcoin is dead. Long live silver.”







Then, Peter Brandt, a highly respected trader and author with over four decades of experience in the commodity and futures markets, entered the fray. Brandt began his career in 1976 with ContiCommodity Services and later founded Factor LLC, a proprietary trading firm. Known for his expertise in classical charting techniques and disciplined risk management, Brandt has authored several influential books, including “Diary of a Professional Commodity Trader,” which provides an insider’s perspective on trading. Brandt is recognized for his successful use of classical chart patterns and is frequently sought for his market insights. He also shares his extensive knowledge through Factor Trading, offering educational content on chart analysis and trading strategies.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

On 18 May 2024, Brandt responded to Schiff’s comments about Bitcoin and silver, advising people to ignore such posts. He suggested that Schiff makes these statements to attract attention and followers, adding that Schiff has been betting on “dead horses.” Brandt dismissed Schiff’s enthusiasm for silver as overblown, stating that just because silver had seen a recent uptick, it didn’t validate Schiff’s overall bearish stance on Bitcoin.



Schiff quickly responded to Brandt, urging him to consider that his views on Bitcoin are genuine. Schiff argued that investing in Bitcoin is like betting on an imaginary horse and warned of the high risks involved, asserting that many would lose money by betting on Bitcoin. He reiterated that his criticism of Bitcoin is not merely for social media engagement but a sincere belief in its high risk and lack of intrinsic value.







In a subsequent post, Schiff expressed frustration with accusations that he criticizes Bitcoin only to generate engagement. He argued that if his goal were to maximize engagement, he would endorse Bitcoin instead. Schiff maintained that he wouldn’t sacrifice his integrity for popularity and described Bitcoin as a pyramid scheme, a “literal blockchain letter.” He contended that Bitcoin promoters mislead people into choosing Bitcoin over gold and declared that if Bitcoin advocates stopped calling it “digital gold,” he would cease his critical posts about it.

Bitcoin Leads Crypto Market Rally as Bulls Regain Control - DailyCoin


        

Bitcoin has surged above key levels, potentially sparking a bullish week for cryptocurrencies.



Eight out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies have seen gains, with Solana emerging as the top performer.



Not all coins have benefited. BNB and Toncoin have bucked the trend with price drops.




In a bullish week for cryptocurrency, Bitcoin surged above key moving averages on May 15. Bulls then successfully defended this level during a retest on May 16, solidifying the upward momentum. This positive movement in Bitcoin has a ripple effect throughout the market, with 8 out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies experiencing gains over the past week.



Solana Emerges as Top Performer



Solana emerged as a standout performer, climbing an impressive 18% over the last 7 days. Bitcoin followed closely behind with a 10% gain, further solidifying its dominance as the leading cryptocurrency. 




Several other major players also saw significant growth, with Shiba Inu, Avalanche, and Cardano each registering gains exceeding 8%. Shiba Inu rose 8.9%, Avalanche gained 8.4%, and Cardano climbed 8.3%.



Established players like Dogecoin and Ethereum also recorded positive movement, increasing 6.2% and 6% respectively. Rounding out the top gainers list, XRP managed a more modest but still positive 2.5% price increase over the past week.



Not all cryptocurrencies shared the bullish sentiment. Two tokens, BNB and Toncoin, fell out of favor with investors, experiencing losses of 2% and 8% respectively over the same period. Overall, the week painted a positive picture for the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin leading the charge and many altcoins experiencing significant gains.



Winners



All but 2 of the top 10 cryptocurrencies experienced price increases over the past week. Here’s a look at them:

Losers



Only 2 of the top 10 cryptocurrencies experienced price losses over the past week. Here’s a look at them, ranked by their percentage decrease:

This is just a snapshot of the current market conditions at the time of writing. Cryptocurrency prices are constantly fluctuating, so it’s important to do your own research before making any investment decisions.



On the Flipside




While the past week saw a surge, cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. This positive movement might not translate to sustained growth.



Looking at a single week’s data offers a limited view. Analyzing longer timeframes provides a clearer picture of overall market health.




Why This Matters



Bitcoin’s surge above key moving averages and subsequent hold solidifies a bullish trend, potentially sparking a domino effect that lifts the entire crypto market. This positive week, with even established altcoins like Ethereum and Dogecoin experiencing gains, suggests a wave of investor confidence that could propel the industry forward.

Bitcoin bulls take charge as SOL, AR, GRT and FTM flash bullish signs

Bitcoin (BTC) has risen over 8% this week, indicating that lower levels continue to attract buyers. Generally, in a range, traders buy near the support and sell close to the resistance. This suggests that the price may reach the top of the range at $73,777, but clearing this hurdle might be difficult.Analysts are divided in their opinion about Bitcoin’s next directional move. Some believe that the correction is over and Bitcoin will break out to a new all-time high, while others expect Bitcoin to turn down to retest the $60,000 support and go lower. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout from a range with certainty. Hence it could be prudent to wait for the price to start a new trend before establishing large trading positions.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360As Bitcoin consolidates, traders may look toward altcoins for short-term trading opportunities. Although a full-blown altseason has still not arrived, select altcoins are likely to present trading opportunities. Could Bitcoin’s potential rise above its near-term resistance boost sentiment in the crypto sector? Let’s study the top 5 cryptocurrencies that look promising on the charts.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin has been facing resistance near $68,000, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded ground to the bears. This suggests that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate a move higher.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe 20-day exponential moving average ($64,109) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the $68,000 level is crossed, the BTC/USDT pair could retest the formidable overhead resistance at $73,777.If bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly yank the price below the moving averages. If they do that, the pair could slump to $59,600 and later to the May 1 intraday low of $56,552.BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

The critical support to watch on the downside is the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off this level, it will improve the prospects of a rally above $68,000.Conversely, if the price breaks below the 20-EMA, it will signal that the bullish momentum is weakening.

If the price rebounds off this level with strength, it will indicate that the bulls are trying to flip $162 into support. That will increase the likelihood of a rally above $176. The SOL/USDT pair may then travel to $185.This positive view will be invalidated in the short term if the price turns down and dives below the moving averages. That could result in long liquidation, pulling the pair to $140.SOL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe pair has turned down from the overhead resistance near $176 and dipped below the 20-EMA. It is likely to retest the breakout level of $162, where the buyers are expected to step in and arrest the decline. Buyers will have to kick the price above $176 to resume the up move.If the pair dips below $162, it will suggest that the bulls may be losing their grip. There is a minor support at the 50-SMA, but if that gives way, the pair may nosedive to $140.Arweave price analysisArweave (AR) has been in an uptrend for the past few days.

If that happens, the AR/USDT pair may surge to $68.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply and plummets below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could trigger a correction to the 50-day SMA ($35).AR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-hour chart shows the formation of a rising wedge pattern. The 20-EMA is the immediate support to watch out for on the downside. If this level gives way, the pair may slide to the support line of the wedge. A break and close below the wedge may start a downward move to $38 and then to $36.Instead, if the price turns up from the 20-EMA or the support line and breaks above the resistance line of the wedge, it will signal that the bulls remain in control.

Epik Duck: From Joke to $25 Million Solana Meme Coin - Decrypt

It took just one flicker of an idea, two minutes of typing, and four SOL. Within an hour, Michael Anderson had created a financial asset worth in excess of $25 million. “I’m sitting here going, ‘What the hell has just happened?’” Anderson, better known by his crypto moniker Mando, told Decrypt. The absurd tale of the asset in question, a Solana meme coin called “Epik Duck,” has particular resonance in crypto at the current moment—one in which a meme coin frenzy has resuscitated long-sagging enthusiasm within the industry, but also threatened to consume it with a naked form of gambling that typically lacks any pretense of technological progress or utility.Last month, during a weekly podcast he hosts with another crypto influencer, Keyboard Monkey, Mando began riffing about making his own meme coin. In recent months, meme-inspired crypto tokens have risen from worthlessness to multi-billion dollar valuations.It used to be that meme coins—first created as jokes poking fun at the sheer volume of worthless, hollow projects flooding the crypto industry—required some amount of technical prowess to create and launch. But even that barrier has fallen away: Services like Pump.fun now allow users to generate new meme coins on Solana in seconds, without writing a single line of code, for a few dollars’ worth of SOL. While recording his live podcast, Mando logged onto Pump.fun and chose an image of a favorite meme of his: the Epik Duck, a Roblox character that resurfaced as a viral joke on Twitter in 2021. Mando titled his new coin “Epik Duck,” and filled in the meme’s pre-existing tagline: “The Epik Duck is coming.” He then paid 4 SOL to launch the token—more than needed—and clicked “launch.” The whole thing took less than two minutes. Epik Duck instantly went viral, in part thanks to Mando’s podcast listeners, who jumped on the token. Within 10 minutes, the coin reached a market capitalization of $1 million. Within an hour, it surpassed $25 million.The 4 SOL Mando had used to launch Epik Duck? That sum, initially worth about $740, bought the influencer 15% of his own token supply—a bag suddenly worth $3.75 million.That’s when a ridiculous situation suddenly got a lot less funny, as Mando tells it. Within hours, the token's market cap plummeted back down to $2 million. In the process, many Epik Duck holders won and lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mando says he moved to burn his own tokens, fearful that people would get the wrong idea about his intentions. “I'm not going to get canceled for this,” Mado said he told himself at the time. “I didn’t want people to think I'd made money off this, that I planned to. It’d just gone absolutely insane.”What had started as a joke quickly morphed into something more serious: a multi-million dollar enterprise with thousands of holders, and Mando suddenly and unwittingly in the CEO’s chair. “From then on, it became a reputation thing,” Mando said. “I was a man on a mission to make this work.”But what, exactly, does it mean to make a meme coin work? Unlike other arguably worthless assets floating around the cryptosphere, meme coins, by self-definition, have no purpose. Their entire utility was once pointing out, as meta-commentary, crypto’s lack of utility. Mando sees things differently—but he’s not your average trader. The crypto influencer previously worked at Barclays and Goldman Sachs trading distressed and high-yield bonds before emptying his and his wife’s savings accounts in 2021 to purchase 80 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. (He ended up selling them for 700% profit.)To Mando, in their total absence of any pretense of meaning, meme coins are the purest form of currency. “We all believe in the dollar. It is a meme,” Mando said. “We all believe in Bitcoin—it is a meme.”“Meme coins, for me, are crypto in its purest form,” he continued. “Meme coins are a speed run in believing in the intrinsic value of something.”Thus, making Epik Duck work was just like making anything else work, in a world bereft of natural value. It was just a game of convincing people. So Mando started a website for Epik Duck, along with a Twitter account and Telegram channel—and then a Chinese Telegram channel and WeChat account. He hired moderators for his social media operations, and he pushed Epik Duck as hard as he could. He said he barely sleeps these days as the Duck increasingly dominates his life.The work’s had mixed results. While the token’s dropped off a fair bit since last month, some people still believe that Epik Duck has value; or at least, some people still believe that other people believe it has value. Since falling from its $25 million peak, the coin still retains a $12 million market cap at writing, per CoinGecko.In the interim, Mando has repurchased an undisclosed sum of the token—mainly, he says, to pay exchanges and market makers and fund community rewards programs. He says he owns somewhere between 3% and 5% of the token’s supply.He’s also invested, along with his business partners, in Pump.fun, praising the Epik Duck saga as proof of the protocol’s democratizing potential to allow any crypto user to—like him—make something out of nothing. Not all see Pump.fun’s ascendancy so positively. Last month, a top executive at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz derided the current explosion of meme coin generation as “undermining the long-term vision of crypto” by turning the industry into “a risky casino.” “This deeply affects adoption, regulation/laws, and builder behavior,” the executive, Eddy Lazzarin, said. “I see the damage every day. You should too.”On Thursday, a disgruntled former Pump.fun employee hacked the protocol in a $2 million exploit that caused the site to temporarily shut down. The hacker later said he had intended to “kill” Pump.fun with the attack. “It’s inadvertently hurt people for a long time,” the former employee later said, when explaining his motivations for attacking the site. On Friday, over 23,000 new fungible tokens were created on the Solana network, an all-time daily record. Just months ago, that figure hovered, on average, at around 300 per day.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Shiba Inu Could Hit Insane '$0.001 SHIB Price' and Spark Another Wild Millionaire Boom ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Numerous memecoins have emerged in the wild, uncharted territory of cryptos, yet few have managed to seize the public’s imagination and evoke such fervor as Shiba Inu. Its staggering 2021 rally turned small investments into life-changing fortunes, fueling dreams of overnight millionaires.



SHIB has had a wild ride, especially during the meme coin craze of late 2020, when its value soared. The idea of SHIB reaching $0.001 has been circulating for some time, contributing to the ongoing speculation around the coin. Despite some analysts’ doubts, the $0.001 target resurfaces in discussions about Shiba Inu’s potential.



Now, as Shiba Inu claws its way back from a steep post-2021 crash, investors are wondering: can it reach $0.001 and ignite another frenzy of wealth creation?



Shiba Inu’s Astronomical Rise and Recent Performance



Rewinding to 2021, Shiba Inu was the talk of the town, boasting an eye-popping gain of over 45,000,000%. For those who had the foresight to invest just $3, they were looking at a cool million in returns. However, the euphoria was short-lived as Shiba Inu plummeted by 92%, mirroring the broader crypto market turmoil triggered by the 2022 FTX contagion.



Fast-forward to 2024. There’s a resurgence of investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market, and Shiba Inu is capitalizing on this trend. Its value has already surged by 120% in 2024, outperforming Bitcoin, which has seen a 50% increase. This raises the question: Could Shiba Inu replicate its historic rally and reach $0.001 from its current price of $0.0000248?

&nbsp



Shiba Inu’s journey to mainstream adoption is still fraught with challenges, even as its price stages a comeback. The token’s utility in the real world remains limited, with just 933 merchants accepting it, as per data—a stark contrast to more established cryptocurrencies. Despite initiatives like Shibarium, which aims to lower transaction costs through a Layer-2 blockchain solution, Shiba Inu has struggled to gain widespread acceptance.



The community has also tried to enhance Shiba Inu’s appeal through projects like Shiba Eternity, a digital card game created in 2022 to expand the token ecosystem. However, these efforts have not translated into widespread adoption, raising questions about Shiba Inu’s long-term sustainability.



Speculation vs. Utility



Shiba Inu’s meteoric rise in 2021 was largely fueled by speculation, with investors banking on its price continuing to soar. However, the token’s subsequent crash served as a stark reminder of the risks associated with speculative investments. To maintain its value and create more, Shiba Inu needs widespread adoption and utility, aspects it currently lacks.



While Shiba Inu’s community is actively working to address these issues, the token’s path to $0.001 remains uncertain. The token’s market capitalization and supply would need to change significantly to support such a price, making it a challenging goal to achieve.



Analyzing potential drivers, such as integrating SHIB into gaming and the metaverse and sustained retail interest, provides a glimpse into what might boost SHIB’s value. Yet, it’s essential to stay realistic and avoid overly optimistic projections, especially regarding SHIB reaching $0.001.



Like many other altcoins, SHIB’s price tends to follow Bitcoin’s movements. While a bullish crypto market could lift SHIB, the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies highlights the need for prudent risk management strategies.

Mike Novogratz Says Bitcoin Won't Reach a New All-Time High Till This Happens ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Market enthusiasts and investors closely monitor the predictions of influential figures. One such prominent voice is Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, who recently shared his insights on Bitcoin’s future trajectory. In a candid interview on Galaxy Digital’s podcast, Novogratz sends a cautious yet insightful warning: Bitcoin (BTC) probably won’t reach new all-time highs without significant macroeconomic shifts.



The Prediction in Detail



Novogratz forecasted that Bitcoin’s price will likely remain within a trading range of $55,000 to $75,000 in the near term. He pointed out that substantial changes in the macroeconomic environment are essential for Bitcoin to break past its previous high of $73,000. Specifically, he mentioned Federal Reserve rate cuts as a critical catalyst that could drive Bitcoin higher.



“I think we’re in a bit of a range – $55,000 to $75,000. It’s probably closer to $57,000 than $73,000. We’ve probably put the low and the high in. I do believe the next move is up because I do think we’re going to get closer to the election, and [Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome] Powell is going to want to cut rates,” Novogratz stated.



The Impact of Economic Conditions



Novogratz discussed how a slowing economy might benefit Bitcoin. However, he stressed that for Bitcoin to make significant gains, either the Federal Reserve needs to act by cutting interest rates or there must be a major development in crypto regulations. Both scenarios probably won’t happen soon, and Bitcoin may continue to trade sideways.



“There’s a resurgence of the ‘Oh my God, the economy’s slowing down’ narrative, which will be helpful. I don’t think Bitcoin will take out the old high, the $73,000 high, unless we get the Fed in action, or we get some big regulatory breakthrough. Those are both probably low delta,” he explained.

Bitcoin as Digital Gold



One of the critical factors Novogratz pointed out is the influence of US federal government spending and the increasing national debt. He believes these economic conditions will drive more investors towards Bitcoin, viewing it as a digital equivalent of gold. According to Novogratz, Bitcoin benefits from the same forces that drive gold’s value up but at a faster rate due to its newer technology and adoption cycle.



“Right now, I talk about two things: crypto regulation and the debt. And they’re at odds with each other. If we had an administration, Biden or Trump, that addressed this 26% of GDP federal budget, which should be 20%, it would not be good for Bitcoin,” Novogratz noted. “And so having really crappy policymakers and profligate spenders and populists in Washington, great for my net worth. That’s just the story of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is going up for the same reason gold is going up. It’s gone up faster because we’re a newer technology, we are a newer commodity, and therefore the adoption cycle is happening faster.”



Mike Novogratz’s insights provide a nuanced perspective on Bitcoin’s potential price movements. While the biggest cryptocurrency may benefit from macroeconomic instability and increasing government debt, significant gains to new all-time highs will likely require more substantial changes, such as Federal Reserve rate cuts or major regulatory advancements.

Ripple records a strong Q1: What does the future hold for XRP? - AMBCrypto



Ripple made massive progress in Q1 in many areas.
Development activity on the network fell.

Ripple [XRP] saw massive fluctuations in terms of price over the last week. However, the progress of Ripple in the first quarter of 2024 could lay the foundation for XRP’s growth in the long run.
Looking at Q1
According to Ripple’s Q1 2024 XRP Markets Report, the number of transactions on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) more than doubled from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the end of the first quarter of 2024, while the average transaction cost almost halved.
Published on the 17th of May, the report reveals that XRPL on-chain transaction activity surged by 108% during Q1 of 2024, reaching approximately 251.39 million transactions, compared to 121.03 million in Q4 of 2023.
Furthermore, the average cost per transaction dropped by 45% to approximately $0.000856.
 
Throughout the first quarter, the distribution of XRP trading volume among cryptocurrency exchanges remained stable, with Binance, Bybit, and Upbit collectively accounting for over 70% of the total traded volume.
Source: Ripple
The report also notes a shift in trading dynamics, as the proportion of volume traded via fiat pairs decreased from 15% in Q4 to 11% in Q1, with most XRP trading now occurring against Tether.
Legal battles
Addressing the ongoing lawsuit with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed in December 2020, Ripple responded to the SEC’s request for $2 billion in remedies on the 22nd of April.
Ripple argued that the law doesn’t permit the SEC to demand disgorgement or interest on disgorgement unless they can prove someone was harmed.
Ripple stated,
“In terms of next steps, both parties will wait for the Judge to make a determination on the final remedies – likely in the coming months.”
Development activity
In terms of overall development, it was observed that the number of core developers on Ripple’s team had increased. However, the number of code commits being made by these developers had fallen significantly.
This implied that the overall development activity on the network had fallen.

Is Ethereum Foundation Connected to EigenLabs? | Cryptopolitan

Recent developments have revealed that three staff members from the Ethereum Foundation are formally connected to EigenLayer entities, sparking discussions within the community. The revelation was made by renowned Ethereum researcher Justin Drake as he disclosed his own involvement with EigenLabs.Justin Drake recently became an advisor to the EigenFoundation, a decision accompanied by a huge financial incentive involving EIGEN tokens potentially valued in the millions, vested over three years. This arrangement underscores the significant financial stakes involved, as Ðrake noted, “We’re talking millions of dollars of tokens vesting over three years.”Researcher Gives Back to EthereumDespite the lucrative deal, Ðrake pledged to channel all proceeds from his advisory role back into the Ethereum ecosystem, in the form of investments or donations. This decision aims to reinforce his commitment to the community, maintaining a balance between personal gain and collective benefit. In his words:I pledge to reinject all advisorship proceeds towards worthy projects within the Ethereum ecosystem, either as investments or donations.He also mentioned his readiness to step back if the direction of EigenLayer diverges from the interests of Ethereum, reflecting his cautious approach to maintaining ethical integrity.Exploring the Advisory ConditionsThe decision to accept the advisory role was not taken lightly; Ðrake mentioned he had turned down over a hundred similar offers before. His engagement began only after a year-long discussion, emphasizing the careful consideration he gave to this role.Also Read: Vitalik Buterin Shares Plans to Improve Ethereum’s DecentralizationThe researcher’s involvement is strictly regulated, focusing on mitigating risks associated with restaking technologies, which is a critical area for Ethereum’s future.Despite his new role at EigenFoundation, Ðrake said he intends to maintain a critical perspective on EigenLayer’s developments. He plans to steer the organization toward practices that safeguard the Ethereum network, particularly against risks that could undermine its decentralized nature, such as the erosion of solo validators.Researcher Pledges Integrity Amidst Formal TiesThe relationship between Ethereum Foundation staff and EigenLabs is not widespread, involving only three of the over 300 members, according to Drake. This limited involvement has, however, raised questions within the community about the potential for undue influence.Ðrake reassures, “EFers are some of the highest integrity people I know,” acknowledging the concerns but defending the ethical standards of his colleagues. His advisory role, while significant, is framed as an independent activity separate from his responsibilities at the Ethereum Foundation.Related: Why Is Ethereum Still Performing Badly?I do acknowledge that accepting the EigenFoundation advisorship inevitably comes with downside risk beyond my personal reputation. I hope the above shows that it is at least a considered move with calculated risks.
Justin DrakeTurning his attention back to Ethereum staking, Drake said he sees restaking risks as either ‘chronic,’ like the erosion of solo validators, or ‘acute,’ such as catastrophic infrastructure failures. His strategies include decoupling execution proposing from validation, capping economic stakes to limit risk, and introducing intersubjective slashing with EIGEN tokens to absorb system shocks.Cryptopolitan reporting by Jai Hamid

Hong Kong's Crypto Ambitions Hit Snag: Can ETFs Steer the Ship? - DailyCoin


        
Hong Kong has launched the region’s first crypto ETFs, aiming to be a financial powerhouse.



Early signs have indicated investor outflows, raising questions about the ultimate success of the strategy.



Despite the challenges, some analysts have predicted a potential surge in assets under management.
Hong Kong’s reputation as a global financial powerhouse took a hit in recent years. Now, the city is looking to a new asset class to revive its mojo: cryptocurrency. But their gamble on crypto ETFs isn’t playing out quite as planned. Will Hong Kong manage to lure investors and become a crypto hub, or will their efforts fizzle out?Hong Kong’s Crypto GambleUnlike the typical “all or nothing” approach to crypto, Hong Kong has taken a measured step. They launched their first Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in late April, hoping to snag a slice of the booming US market already valued at a staggering $55 billion. But instead of a windfall, Hong Kong’s ETFs have seen a concerning trend: investor outflows. The initial excitement quickly fizzled, leaving analysts scratching their heads. So, what’s behind this crypto conundrum? Experts point to two main culprits. 
First, the US stole the show. By launching their ETFs months earlier, they established a dominant position, leaving Hong Kong playing catch-up. Second, the shadow of China looms large. Is Hong Kong the Next Crypto Hub?China’s strict stance on cryptocurrencies has investors jittery, unsure of how much support Hong Kong’s crypto ambitions truly have from their mainland neighbor. But here’s the twist: despite the rocky start, some analysts are bullish on Hong Kong’s crypto future. Rebecca Sin from Bloomberg highlights the fact that despite the outflows, total assets under management (AUM) still surpass $250 million. This suggests there’s underlying interest, and with more players entering the market, the AUM could balloon to a cool $1 billion within two years.
Hong Kong’s crypto play is a high-stakes gamble. Can they overcome the challenges and become a frontrunner in the crypto space, or will their efforts be overshadowed by regional rivals like Singapore and Dubai? Buckle up, because the next chapter in Hong Kong’s financial story is still being written.On the Flipside
Hong Kong’s ETFs come with hefty management fees compared to similar products in the US, potentially deterring cost-conscious investors.



Hong Kong’s regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which could create hesitancy among investors seeking clear guidelines.



Established financial institutions in Hong Kong may be slow to embrace crypto, limiting the overall market size and investor pool.
Why This MattersHong Kong’s struggle to attract investors with their new crypto ETFs highlights the challenges traditional financial centers face in capturing a slice of the booming cryptocurrency market. The outcome could set a precedent for how established financial hubs navigate this new asset class, with implications for global crypto adoption and regulation.This article explores why Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs are failing to meet expectations, while the US market is thriving:HK’s Bitcoin ETFs Fizzle, Casting Doubt on Crypto Hub DreamsThis article discusses how the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong could potentially allow Chinese investors to indirectly invest in crypto:Are Bitcoin ETFs Poised To Reshape China’s No-Crypto Stance?

Ripple Publishes Expert Warning on Quantum Threat

Ripple published a message by mathematician Massimiliano Sala expressing his fear of the dangers quantum computing poses to blockchain encryption. Sala, a professor at the University of Trento, discussed the problem during Ripple’s university lecturer series, stressing the importance of creating robust and quantum-secure cryptosystems.Also read: Quantum Computing’s Impact on Digital SecurityPotential Risks by Quantum Identified by Mathematician SalaProf. Sala asserted that quantum computers can somehow solve digital signature-based problems easily, an opportunity that could cause a platform security breach in blockchains. This advancement, dubbed “Q-day,” will likely render present public key cryptosystems vulnerable to quantum attacks. The most likely consequence is compromised user assets and data integrity.Sala proclaimed that quantum computers can break encryption standards safeguarding blockchain systems. This implies that the security of digital assets would be greatly compromised.Development of Quantum-Resistant CryptographySala highlighted the immediate need to develop and apply quantum-resistant crypto methods to protect against forthcoming quantum attacks with blockchain technologies. This change is necessary to ensure the security and integrity of blockchain services amid the increased prevalence of the new generation of quantum technology.Sala reiterated the need to take the transition towards quantum-facing cryptosystems seriously to ensure the well-being of digital structures and cautioned that catastrophic threats of failure might affect many industries heavily dependent on blockchain.Also read: The Race to Quantum-Proof Blockchain TechnologyGlobal Efforts to Address Quantum ThreatGlobally, governments and scientific entities attentively accept the threat of quantum computing and are actively developing plans to mitigate its effects. Recent advances in quantum algorithms and hardware have increased the pace at which useful quantum systems are being employed, thus presenting a more challenging and immediate threat, Sala noted. Sala proposes to continue working with blockchain developers and encryption experts, including the current standards and innovations in quantum-safe cryptography in the designed technology. Such a preventive method is no longer a choice as risks should not be taken with digital assets, and there is a need to maintain the reliability of blockchain systems.Cryptopolitan Reporting by Emman Omwanda

India's Securities Regulator and RBI Clash Over Crypto Regulations | Cryptopolitan

India’s debate over cryptocurrency regulation heats up as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) present contrasting views to government panels. The ongoing discord highlights the struggle to align on the approach towards the cryptocurrency space, which has been a popular issue within the country’s financial and regulatory circles.Reportedly, the SEBI has taken a proactive step by suggesting that various regulators should oversee the cryptocurrency market, indicating a change towards more open regulatory attitudes. But then here comes the RBI. Will they let that happen?SEBI Proposes Multi-Regulator OversightSEBI has put forward a proposal suggesting that cryptocurrency trade should be overseen by multiple regulatory bodies, according to newly surfaced documents. This recommendation marks a clear departure from previous more cautious stances, showing a willingness among some Indian regulators to embrace the complexities of cryptocurrencies.Related: Binance and Kucoin Resume Crypto Services in IndiaSEBI’s proposal includes allowing different entities to regulate specific aspects of the cryptocurrency market. For instance, assets tied to insurance and pensions could fall under the purview of the IRDAI and the PFRDA, respectively.In addition to general oversight, SEBI also sees itself potentially regulating Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies that are considered securities, similar to practices in the United States. This approach would involve issuing licenses for equity market-related products within the crypto industry, aiming to integrate these assets into the traditional financial system while ensuring proper oversight.RBI Maintains Call for a BanContrasting sharply with SEBI’s openness, the RBI continues to push for a complete ban on stablecoins and maintains a conservative position on private cryptocurrencies. The central bank argues that these pose a macroeconomic risk and could lead to issues like tax evasion and loss of seigniorage.According to a person close to the panel’s discussions, the RBI’s submissions emphasized the dangers of decentralized, peer-to-peer platforms which operate based on voluntary compliance, highlighting risks to fiscal stability.The RBI’s stringent view follows its historical approach that began in 2018 when it initially banned financial institutions from dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges and users—a decision that was later overturned by the Supreme Court. Despite the court’s ruling, the RBI has encouraged banks to adhere strictly to stringent money laundering and foreign exchange guidelines to reduce the risks associated with cryptocurrencies.Government Weighs its Regulatory OptionsAs the government panel tasked with deciding on these recommendations moves closer to finalizing its report, the tension between SEBI’s progressive proposals and RBI’s conservative views captures a historical moment in India’s cryptocurrency regulation drama.Also Read: India’s Economic Growth Is Proving to Be SustainableThe ongoing debate also reflects a global dilemma over how best to regulate cryptocurrencies. As India dealt with its presidency of the G20 last year, it called for a global framework to regulate such assets, indicating its recognition of both the international implications and the need for a coordinated approach to cryptocurrency governance.Now the clock ticks towards the defining moment in June, and India is standing right at the edge of a regulatory revolution. Will the nation embrace crypto once and for all, or will it officially kick it to the curb?Cryptopolitan reporting by Jai Hamid

Solana hits $175, faces pullback: What's next for SOL? - AMBCrypto



Solana’s price increased by more than 20% in the last seven days. 
If the bull rally resumes, then SOL might go above $180.

Solana [SOL] managed to reclaim $175 on the 18th of May, but it soon witnessed a price correction, pushing the token’s value down. Does this mean SOL is bound to go down further in the coming days?
 Let’s take a look at SOL’s current state to find out. 
Solana back to $175
Last week was a tremendous success for Solana, as the token’s price rallied substantially. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL’s price surged by more than 20% in the last seven days, allowing it to touch $175.
 However, SOL couldn’t hold that spot as it dipped. 
At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $174.39 with a market capitalization of over $78.2 billion. 
The decline from $175 also had a negative impact on the token’s social metrics. Its Weighted Sentiment dropped sharply, meaning that bearish sentiment around it was dominant in the market. 
Nonetheless, its Social Volume remained stable.
Source: Santiment
Investors shouldn’t get disheartened, as a recent analysis suggested that SOL’s price might skyrocket. Alex Clay, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting an interesting development. 
In a monthly time frame, SOL displayed a rounding bottom pattern. If this pattern tests out, then investors might soon witness SOL reach new highs. 
What to expect in the short term
AMBCrypto then analyzed SOL’s on-chain metrics to see whether investors should expect a massive surge in the near term. As per our analysis, SOL’s Funding Rate had increased sharply. 
A rise in the metric meant that derivatives investors were buying SOL. According to Coinglass’ data, SOL’s Open Interest also increased, which might serve as a push for the coin’s weekly rally. 
Source: Santiment
However, concerns still remain. The coin’s fear and greed index had a value of 75% at press time, meaning that the market was in an extreme greed phase. Such numbers often result in price drops. 
We then analyzed SOL’s daily chart to see which way it was headed.
 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) looked pretty bullish, as it had a value of 64. However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) moved in the other direction. ‘
Additionally, Solana’s price had touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands, indicating a possible price correction.

If a price correction happens, SOL’s price might fall to $173.5 as liquidation would rise sharply, which might act as a support. A further downfall could push SOL’s price to $165. ‘
However, if SOL manages to continue its weekly bull run, then the token might be able to go above $180.

Confidential UN Report Exposes Lazarus Group's $147.5M Stolen Crypto Transfer to North Korea


																A confidential United Nations report obtained by Reuters reveals that North Korea’s notorious cybercriminal group known as the Lazarus Group transferred millions of stash of stolen cryptocurrency back to the Asian country last year.
In March 2023, these North Korean hackers illicitly took $147.5 million worth of cryptocurrency from HTX, a crypto exchange owned by TRON founder Justin Sun. A year later, they funneled the funds into the isolated nation using the sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash.
North Korea’s Cyber Warfare
According to a report submitted last week, the monitors told a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions committee that they had been probing 97 suspected North Korean cyberattacks on cryptocurrency firms between 2017 and 2024, valued at approximately $3.6 billion.
The monitors also reported that North Korean IT workers abroad earn significant income for their country based on information from U.N. member states and private companies. They were also looking into a New York Times report from February 6, which claimed that Russia had released $9 million out of $30 million in frozen North Korean assets and had permitted Pyongyang to open an account at a Russian bank in South Ossetia, facilitating better access to international banking networks.
The Lazarus Group and other North Korean hackers have executed some of the most lucrative hacks in the crypto and DeFi sectors, and Tornado Cash has been their go-to tumbler.




In 2022, the US sanctioned Tornado Cash, accusing it of aiding North Korea. In 2023, two of its co-founders were charged with facilitating over $1 billion in money laundering, including for a cybercrime group associated with North Korea.
North Korea’s Diverse Targets in $1B Crypto Theft
An earlier report released by the UNSC revealed that North Korea acquired 50% of its foreign exchange earnings from cyberattacks. The nation expanded its targeting of cryptocurrency platforms in 2023, hitting more than ever before.
However, the total amount stolen was lower compared to 2022, according to Chainalysis. Despite this decrease, the number of hacks reached a record high of 20, coinciding with a general downturn in the crypto market.
In 2023, the blockchain analysis firm estimated that the total stolen cryptocurrency amounted to just over $1 billion. Notably, North Korean hackers concentrated on DeFi, stealing approximately $429 million in the process. They also targeted centralized services, exchanges, and wallet providers, where they pilfered $150 million, $330.9 million, and $127 million, respectively.

Ripple publishes math prof’s warning: ‘public-key cryptosystems should be replaced’

Professor Massimiliano Sala, of the University of Trento in Italy, recently discussed the future of blockchain technology, as it relates to encryption and quantum computing, with the crew at Ripple as part of the company’s ongoing university lecture series. Sala’s discussion focused on the potential threat posed by quantum computers as the technology matures. According to the professor, current encryption methods could be easy for tomorrow’s quantum computers to solve, thus putting entire blockchains at risk. Source: @Ripple on X.com.Per Sala:"Quantum computers could easily solve problems that are foundational to digital signatures, thus potentially undermining the mechanisms that protect users' assets on blockchain platforms."What the professor is referring to is a hypothetical paradigm called “Q-day,” a point at which quantum computers become sufficiently powerful and available for bad actors to break classical encryption methods. While this would have far-reaching implications for any field where data security is important — including emergency services, infrastructure, banking, and defense — it could theoretically devastate the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain.Specifically, Sala warns that “all classical public-key cryptosystems should be replaced with counterparts secure against quantum attacks.” The idea here being that a future quantum computer or quantum attack algorithm could crack the encryption on these keys using mathematical brute force. It bears mention that Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency and blockchain, would fall under this category. While there currently exists no practical quantum computer capable of such a feat, governments and science institutions around the globe have been preparing for Q-day as if it’s an eventuality. For his part, Sala says that such an event may not be imminent. However, physicists at dozens of academic and commercial laboratories have demonstrated breakthroughs that have led many in the field to believe such systems could arrive within a matter of years. Ultimately, Sala says he’s satisfied with the progress being made in the sector and recommends that blockchain developers continue to work with encryption experts who understand the standards and innovations surrounding quantum-proofing modern systems.

Is XRP in 'Crab Market'? Solana (SOL) Reaches Major Resistance Level Before $200, Ethereum (ETH) Really Needs This Price Level

It seems like XRP is not making any attempt to break through the currently shown tendency in the market. The asset has barely moved since the beginning of the month, and the most recent breakthrough attempt at $0.54 only pushed the asset back below $0.50. The cryptocurrency is moving up again, but it will most likely end up in a "crab market."The term "crab market" is a state where an asset's price moves sideways without significant upward or downward trends. XRP’s price action is a textbook example. Despite occasional spikes, the overall movement is horizontal. This lack of direction can be frustrating.XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewLooking at the chart, XRP has been struggling to break past the resistance levels defined by the 50-day EMA and the 100-day EMA, both of which hover around $0.54 and $0.55, respectively. These moving averages have been acting as strong barriers, preventing any substantial upward movement.Moreover, the volume is another indicator suggesting a lack of strong buying interest. Over the past weeks, the trading volume has been relatively low, indicating that traders are hesitant to commit significantly in either direction. This low volume typically accompanies a "crab market," reinforcing the idea that XRP might stay in this pattern for a while.For XRP to break out of this stagnation, it would need a significant catalyst, either from a fundamental development in the cryptocurrency market or a strong technical breakout above the resistance levels.Solana's major resistanceSolana has finally reached a crucial resistance level, which is possibly the last threshold it will have to break in order to come closer to the long-desired $200 mark. However, it is not yet obvious if Solana will be able to break through.Solana is currently testing the resistance around $175, a level that has previously acted as a strong barrier. This resistance is reinforced by the 50-day EMA, which is converging around the same price point. The recent price action suggests that bulls are trying to push the price higher, but the real test will be breaking above this resistance and sustaining the momentum.Over the past few days, there has been a noticeable increase in trading volume, indicating growing interest among traders. Increase in volume suggests there is significant buying power backing the recent price surge. For Solana to break past the $175 resistance and aim for $200, it will need continued strong volume.As for the RSI, it is approaching the overbought territory. While this indicates strong bullish momentum, it also suggests that the asset might be due for a short-term correction or consolidation before attempting another upward move. If the RSI can remain above the midline after a potential pullback, it would signal sustained bullish momentum.Historically, Solana has faced significant resistance around the $175-$180 range. Breaking this level would be a major milestone and could open the path to $200. However, failure to break through could lead to a retracement back to support levels around $155 or even $143.Ethereum needs itEther has not been the strongest cryptocurrency on the market since the beginning of the year. It struggled to hit an all-time high (ATH), lagged behind Bitcoin's performance, and the overall ecosystem did not flourish during the bull market. With ETH's price reaching a critical level, we should all hope bulls will be able to push it just a bit further.Ethereum is currently facing a significant resistance level around $3,150, marked by the 50-day EMA and the historical zone of surging selling pressure. The last time Ethereum reached the aforementioned area it quickly retraced toward $2,900.Volume is a key indicator to watch. Over the past few days, there has been a noticeable increase in trading volume, which is a positive sign. Higher volume indicates stronger buying interest and market participation. For ETH to break past the $3,150 resistance, sustained high volume is necessary.The RSI is currently hovering around the midline, suggesting that ETH is neither overbought nor oversold. This neutral RSI provides room for further upward movement if buying pressure increases. However, if the RSI approaches the overbought territory without a significant price increase, it could signal a potential pullback or consolidation.Support levels to watch include the 50-day EMA around $3,050 and the psychological support at $3,000. If ETH fails to break the $3,150 resistance, it might retrace back to these support levels. On the other hand, a successful breakout could see ETH targeting higher resistance levels around $3,300 and potentially $3,500.

Analyst Issues Chainlink Warning, Says 55% Correction for LINK Natural and Healthy Following 4X Rise - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist is warning that Chainlink (LINK) may be on the verge of a massive correction.
Pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 394,500 followers on the social media platform X that the native asset of the leading decentralized oracle network appears to have printed a mid-cycle top.










According to the analyst, a deep corrective move is now in the cards for LINK after witnessing massive rallies in the last few months.
“I understand that after 10 months of up only and a 4x rally, a pullback lasting 2-3 months with a 50-60% drawdown is normal, natural and healthy.
Further, anything deeper than that but above the origin of the impulsive move is a higher low and technically totally fine.” 
Source: Credible/X
The trader uses the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave rise before pulling back. Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that LINK has completed its five-wave rally and is now poised for a correction toward support at $7.26.
At time of writing, LINK is worth $16.49.
Credible is also bearish on Ethereum (ETH) scaling solution Polygon (MATIC), predicting that the altcoin will fall to support at $0.585.
“Hello MATIC my old friend, it’s time to short you once again.
Up to 5-8% more potential upside, looking for 20% downside at minimum.” 
Source: Credible/X
At time of writing, MATIC is worth $0.706.

                        The government of Paraguay will ask lawmakers to approve a bill that proposes jailing illegal Bitcoin (BTC) miners for up to 10 years.The presidential spokesperson Paula Carro told reporters on Friday May 17 that the government has sent the bill to parliament “as a matter of urgency.”
10 Years in Jail: Illegal Bitcoin Miners Face Longer Prison Terms
Carro said that the bill seeks to “punish” illegal miners with “multiple years in prison.”The draft law will also allow Paraguayan police and prosecutors to seize mining equipment from illegal operators.Per Criptonoticias, Carro also said the bill “seeks to protect the state-owned National Electricity Administration (ANDE).”She added that the “theft of large amounts of energy by illegal Bitcoin mining operators” was posing a “threat” to ANDE.The terms of the bill allow courts to impose “a maximum sentence” of a decade in jail “for the crime of energy theft.”The proposals also allow ANDE to ask police to seize mining rigs and sell these off, with the state-run firm to be “the beneficiary of the proceeds.” Bitcoin mining has boomed in Paraguay, where lawmakers have fought to bring it into the legal sphere.The country has considerable power resources that BTC miners find ideal – namely surplus hydroelectric energy.However, in recent years, many Paraguay-based miners have sought to create illegal connections to grids.And power providers have complained they are facing overloads and other issues.Police have responded by launching a crackdown. Since the beginning of this year, officers have seized more than 5,000 ASIC miners.The Yacyretá Dam, a major source of Paraguayan electrical power.

ANDE has taken part in some 17 raids on illegal BTC and altcoin mining farms nationwide since the start of 2024.This has also led to a flurry of activity in parliament. At least 14 lawmakers have backed a private member’s bill that would effectively ban Bitcoin mining in the country.The bill proposes a “temporary” block on BTC mining “until the problem of illegal mining is resolved.”However, this bill has not yet cleared the committee phase, and it is not certain that it will reach the house for a vote.Should the government succeed with its own bill, this private member’s bill will likely be shelved.Carro that the government’s bill has the backing of the Public Ministry, ANDE, and the Paraguayan Judiciary.She concluded that illegal BTC mining “has resulted in millions of dollars worth of losses” for Paraguayan power providers.

Kraken Claims “No Plans” to Delist USDT From EU Exchange - DailyCoin


        

Kraken clarifies its stance on potentially delisting USDT. 



A company executive assures Kraken has no immediate plans to remove USDT from its listings.



Despite this assurance, the looming MiCA regulations could compel Kraken to delist USDT if Tether doesn’t comply.




Recently, rumors swirled that Kraken could be considering cutting support for USDT in the European Union ahead of the upcoming MiCA regime, which will kick in this July.



A Kraken spokesperson hinted at the exchange bracing for the worst, given Tether’s apparent disinterest in aligning with the new rules. As anxiety grew among users, Kraken’s Global Head of Asset Growth and Management, Mark Greenberg, stepped forward to set the record straight.



Kraken Sets The Record Straight



“We have no plans to delist at this time,” Greenberg said, dismissing rumors about Kraken potentially dropping USDT from the EU market. He emphasized that Kraken recognized USDT’s role in the European market and would continue to support it.




Greenberg explained that Kraken is exploring all options to keep USDT available under the upcoming MiCA regulations. He added that Kraken will comply with all legal requirements, even those they may disagree with, hinting that if Tether is ultimately banned, Kraken will adhere to the law. 



Greenberg noted that the MiCA rules regarding stablecoins still need to be finalized. Until the regulatory position is clearer, Kraken will continue offering all relevant stablecoins to its European customers.



However, with the new regulations set to take effect in July, the future of stablecoins in the EU remains uncertain.



MiCA’s Looming Threat to Stablecoins



Although they have yet to be finalized, the upcoming MiCA regime could challenge the legitimacy of many stablecoins in the region, particularly USDT. Regulators stress that many stablecoins currently in circulation in Europe have yet to be authorized and regulated.




MiCA regulations stipulate that only EMIs and credit institutions can legally issue fiat stablecoins within the European Economic Area trading bloc. This means that stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle must either become an EMI or partner with one to continue offering their products legally in the region.



Tether’s CEO confirmed that the company had no plans to comply with the new MiCA regulations in the medium term, expressing concerns about the potential risks and impacts of the new rules.



“That would pose severe risks to stablecoins regulated in the EU,” Ardoino said in response to MiCA’s added scrutiny on stablecoin issuers. He urged regulators to learn from incidents like the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and its impact on a major US stablecoin. “If a bank goes bankrupt, uninsured cash goes into bankruptcy,” he warned.



Until MiCA amends its current regulations or Tether announces compliance, USDT’s legal status in the EU is expected to become illegal after July, presenting a complex dilemma for users and companies in the region.



On the Flipside




Due to USDT’s lack of interest in complying with the new MiCA rules, OKX has already removed support for the stablecoin in the EU.



MiCA is still being finalized and is expected to be fully implemented by 2025.



USDT issuer Circle is also relocating its operations from the EU to the US.




Why This Matters



The new MiCA regime can shake up the crypto industry in the EU, particularly impacting the stablecoin market. If Tether remains steadfast in its protest against the new rules, exchanges like Kraken will be forced to delist the token, leading to far-reaching implications for the trading bloc.Charles Hoskinson airs his frustration:Cardano’s Hoskinson Predicts Crypto to Decide 2024 ElectionsGenesis’ Chapter 11 receives court approval:Court Clears Genesis’ $3B Bankruptcy Plan Despite DCG Objection.

Crypto exchange Kraken has ‘no plans’ to delist USDT in Europe for now

Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has “no plans” to delist Tether (USDT) in Europe at the moment despite a recent report claiming the firm was “actively reviewing” the decision to remain legally compliant.“[Kraken] continues to list USDT in Europe and we have no plans to delist at this time,” stated Mark Greenberg, Kraken’s global head of asset growth and management in a May 18 X post.The firm will continue to follow all legal requirements — even those that it disagrees with — Greenberg iterated. “But the rules are not finalized yet and we continue to do everything we can to continue to offer all relevant stablecoins to our European customers.”Source: Mark GreenbergA May 17 article from Bloomberg reported Kraken was “actively reviewing” plans to comply with the European Union’s upcoming Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework.“We’re absolutely planning for all eventualities, including situations where it’s just not tenable to list specific tokens such as USDT,” said Marcus Hughes, Kraken’s global head of regulatory strategy at the time. “It’s something that we’re actively reviewing, and as the position becomes clearer, we can take firm decisions on that.”The rules applicable to stablecoins under MiCA will come into force on June 30, while cryptocurrency service provider rules will take effect six months later on Dec. 30.Related: Kraken exchange rolls out self-custody crypto wallet, following other CEXsOne of Kraken’s biggest competitors, OKX, made the move to delist USDT in Europe in March.Binance announced plans to make a similar decision last September — citing a need to comply with MiCA — but the firm hasn’t followed through with those plans yet. Kraken recently ended support for the Monero privacy token (XMR) for its Belgium and Ireland customers in April. Meanwhile, the crypto exchange has continued to expand its services in Europe. It recently secured a virtual asset service provider registration in Spain and the Netherlands, as well as an electronic money institution license in Ireland.Magazine: ‘Crypto is inevitable’ so we went ‘all in’: Meet Vance Spencer, permabull

Crypto Whales Bet Big on Mollars, Toncoin, and Cardano


                        
                            Crypto Whales Bet Big on Mollars, Toncoin, and Cardano                        
                        

                         The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a significant shift when it comes to mainstream adoption. Embarking on the Bitcoin halving, and BTC ETF hype, the space is seeing an increase in its users.On that trend, crypto whales—investors capable of moving market trends due to their sizable funds—are also becoming more active. Interestingly enough, whales appear to be diversifying their holdings, betting on promising altcoins capable of becoming industry giants in the futureToncoin (TON): Climbing the Ranks
Toncoin has made a dramatic entrance into the top ten cryptocurrencies, surpassing well-known assets like Shiba Inu and Cardano. The catalyst for this ascent was the March announcement of Telegram’s potential initial public offering (IPO), prompting whales to accumulate TON in anticipation of a price surge. This accumulation was reflected in a significant rise in transactions valued over $100,000 and even those surpassing $1 million. Toncoin’s price experienced a staggering 238% increase, peaking at $7.24 before stabilizing around $5.35 as the initial rally cooled off.Cardano (ADA): A Steady Accumulation
Since November 2023, Cardano (ADA) has seen a notable increase in accumulation by crypto whales. This trend has picked up significantly in recent days, with transactions exceeding $100,000—typically the hallmark of whale activity—becoming more frequent.Although this surge in whale activity hasn’t yet translated into a significant price increase, the growing interest from these big players could eventually provide a boost to Cardano’s market value. Despite holding less than 10% of ADA’s circulating supply, these whales play a crucial role in driving daily trading volumes, suggesting that their sustained interest could herald positive price movements in the near future.Arbitrum (ARB): Preparing for a Rally
Despite undergoing price corrections for nearly two months, Arbitrum (ARB) remains a focus for crypto whales. These investors have been steadily accumulating ARB, possibly to stave off further price drops and to position themselves advantageously for future gains.The anticipation of a Bitcoin halving event has driven much of this activity, as whales prepare for a potential market rally. Additionally, the upcoming token unlock on May 16, which will introduce over $100 million worth of tokens into the market, is expected to impact prices. Whales might be looking to sell before this event to capitalize on their investments. Mollars (MOL): The New Darling of Whales
According to a recent report from CryptoNews, whale investors are moving their profits from Shiba Inu (SHIB) to the up-and-coming Mollars (MOL), reflecting a broader trend of seeking high-potential opportunities. A prominent investor known as ‘King Shrimp’ has been gradually acquiring Mollars during the presale, employing a Dollar Cost Averaging strategy to mitigate market volatility and optimize returns. This methodical approach highlights the confidence that large investors have in Mollars’ growth potential.Mollars’ presale has gained substantial traction, buoyed by announcements from major exchanges such as BitMart, LBank, and XT that they will list $MOL on their platforms post-ICO on May 31st. So far the new project sold over 28% of its total supply, garnering over $1.3 million from sales.This has generated considerable excitement within the crypto community, as the token’s design as a deflationary store-of-value asset, combined with its scarcity—capped at just 10 million tokens—positions it as a highly desirable investment. The prospect of Mollars becoming one of the year’s most sought-after tokens seems increasingly likely, especially given the strong early interest and strategic whale investments. With its strategic exchange listings, Mollars is set to be introduced to over 24 million users worldwide, further enhancing its market presence and appeal.

Bitcoin repeats THIS historical pattern: Is a bull rally coming? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin saw a sharp rally in early May.
The drop below the SSR oscillator bands was seen then- but will we see an extended rally hereon?

Bitcoin [BTC] was trading at $67k at press time and threatened to break out past the range that it consolidated within over the past month.
Fears around sell-offs around the halving period were losing strength.
Bitcoin ETFs also saw inflows over the past week, indicating a tangible increase in demand. The push to the range highs relieved the selling pressure of recent weeks, but can the bulls manage a breakout?
Gauging the ammo reserves of the bulls
A crypto analyst highlighted in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that the stablecoin supply ratio (SSR) oscillator showed bullishness.
The technical indicator assesses stablecoin market sentiment relative to Bitcoin over time.
It is calculated by taking the current SSR and its difference with the 200-period simple moving average. This value is divided by its standard deviation over the same period to arrive at a set of Bollinger Bands (BB).
The current stablecoin supply is plotted over these bands to give traders insights into what the market sentiment is like.
When the SSR falls below the lower Bollinger Band, it indicates low stablecoin dominance and potential bullish sentiment.

The chart above highlights how the market tends to pull back when the oscillator is overheated. Conversely, when the lower bands are breached, it generally provides a good long-term buying opportunity.
Like any other technical indicator, the SSR oscillator was not infallible, and each signal was not a guarantee of a price move in the expected direction.
We are still within a “buy” signal

The stablecoin supply ratio was below the 200-period SMA but above the lower BB. It fell below this band in early May, when Bitcoin prices reached $56k. However, the price immediately rebounded higher.
The oscillator was still in the lower BB and suggested that further gains were likely. The SSR also saw a downtrend over the past month.

The metric has been aggressively trending higher since October 2023. Periods of stasis or pullback such as early January and mid-May were present.
A month after the January pullback, Bitcoin prices rocketed higher to breach the $46k resistance with ease. Perhaps in the next 2–4 weeks, we might see a Bitcoin rally push well beyond the $73k resistance.

                        A Russian court has sent a Finiko executive to prison for three years, after finding her guilty of helping to mastermind the biggest crypto scam in “post-Soviet history.”Per Izvestia, Liliya Nurieva, the former head of networks at Finiko, was handed a four and a half year term at a court in Vakhitovsky, Kazan on May 17.However, the court said it would consider the time she had already spent in pre-trial custody as “time served.”The judge rejected prosecutors’ requests to jail Nurieva for six and a half years.Finiko Crypto Scam: First Exec Jailed
The media outlet explained that Nurieva had been facing a 10-year jail term before her trial.But, it revealed, the former executive struck a “pre-trial agreement” with prosecutors.The executive’s lawyer told media representatives that Nurieva intended to appeal the sentence. She was found guilty of fraud and organized crime-related offences.Former Finiko executive Liliya Nurieva at her trial in Kazan on May 24.

And Finiko offices throughout the country closed “almost overnight.”The Finiko executives have since blamed one another for the collapse. But during its heydey, Finiko was a huge hit on social media.Investors Attend Court Hearing
Initial reports claimed that almost 10,000 people may have invested their money on Finiko platforms.The firm was given a veneer of authenticity through the well-spoken Doronin.Sabirov, meanwhile, is the former business partner of Russia’s ex-Communications Minister Nikolai Nikiforov.Nuriyeva’s lawyer told the court that her client had no idea that Finiko was a scam when she joined the company.The lawyer added that Nuriyeva had even invested her own money in the company, and only realized it was fraudulent “during her later communication with senior executives.”Several Finiko investors attended the trial. Izvestia quoted one of them, Lyudmila Yamshchikova from Kazan, as explaining:“At one point the [Finiko] payments stopped. They just stopped, all of a sudden. I invested almost [$11,000]. I was counting on the payments, as I was using them to pay off my mortgage. Half of our city bought apartments, cars, and took out loans because of Finiko. But then the withdrawals just dried up.”

Vitalik Buterin Says 'Proud' Ethereum Doesn't Censor Critical Views, Social Media Users Complain The Reality Is Opposite - Benzinga

Ethereum ETH/USD co-founder and one of the biggest voices in the cryptocurrency space, Vitalik Buterin, praised the ecosystem's free speech ideals. However, the assertion faced backlash from a group of people on social media.What Happened: The man behind one of the biggest blockchain projects took to social platform X to take pride in Ethereum's culture of welcoming criticism and not silencing voices with negative feedback on its work."Some wave the ideal of “open discourse” as a flag, some take it seriously," Buterin said, in an apparent dig at censorship happening on other blockchain platforms. These claims, however, were challenged by social media users who narrated facing significant censorship by Ethereum influencers. An X user going by the pseudonym dubzy responded, "Well I told someone that eth fees were expensive and he abused me for 13 minutes, explain that?" Matthew Gould, founder and CEO of blockchain firm Unstoppable Domains, said he faced the exact opposite of what Buterin preached, including heavy censorship by some projects on the network and condemnation of divergent opinions on their operations.Why It Matters: Constructive criticism of technology and processes is critical to any industry’s overall progress, as any expert will tell you.Solana SOL/USD co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko endorsed Buterin's view and deemed it an industry-wide phenomenon."The whole industry is awesome. You don't see Microsoft and Google and Apple engineers all in one chat room constantly challenging each others design decisions," Yakavenko wrote while responding to Buterin's post.Price Action: At the time of writing, Ethereum was exchanging hands at $3,089.07, down 1.43% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Photo by Alexey Smyshlyaev on Shutterstock.Read Next: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum Retrace On Profit-Taking By Retail Investors: Analyst Predicts Parabolic Rise For King Crypto Following Consolidation Phase

London Police Arrest Alleged Pump.fun Exploiter


British police reportedly have arrested Jarett Dunn, known online as @STACCoverflow, for allegedly exploiting the Solana meme coin protocol pump.fun.
The arrest follows an over 24-hour intelligence operation that tracked Dunn’s movements through social media and other open sources.
London Police Arrest Alleged Pump.fun Exploiter Jarett Dunn

The pump.fun protocol, exploited on May 16, had previously employed Dunn. After the attack, he openly criticized the company on social media. Dunn expressed his intention to disrupt the platform and stated he was not worried about going to jail.
A private intelligence firm, hired by a third-party stakeholder, tracked Dunn’s movements using his social media posts and other open-source intelligence. The timing of his last post on the X account @STACCverflow matched the arrest. A recent Instagram post showed him at a London strip club, which helped identify his whereabouts.
After hours of search in London’s Covent Garden neighborhood, local authorities found Dunn at the Middle Eight Hotel and arrested him.

Dunn’s arrest has sparked significant reactions in the crypto community. On his @JarrettDunn X account, he confirmed spending the night in custody.

“I spent overnight in custody as the Pump team alleges I stole $2 million of their ill-gotten gains with conspiracy to steal another $80 million,” he wrote.

Dunn explained that the pump.fun’s team appeared to be claiming total value locked (TVL) as their money in the charge. Therefore, he urged investors to withdraw their money from pump.fun immediately. He also called for UK citizens to file charges against a company he identified as pump.fun’s corporate entity.

Dunn plans to remain in the UK until his court appearance, which is scheduled for August. He was released on bail.

Shiba Inu: Shibarium transactions decline massively: Will it affect SHIB? - AMBCrypto



Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain for Shiba Inu, has seen a big drop in transactions by 97%.
SHIB’s price has increased by 10% over the last month, maintaining its market rank at No. 12 with a $14.6 billion cap.

Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain underpinning the popular meme coin Shiba Inu [SHIB], is experiencing a huge drop in transaction activity. 
For about a month now, transaction volumes have plummeted dramatically by nearly 97%. This decline has triggered an examination into the state of Shibarium and its potential impact on SHIB’s price.
Despite these challenges, the overall transaction volume on Shibarium since its launch last August reflects a total of 417,479,277 transfers, so there is a slow but steady growth in activity, year-on-year.
A closer look at the tumble
The transaction peak on Shibarium reached an all-time high of 562,990 daily transactions on the 17th of April. Fast-forward to today, and the figure has drastically fallen to just 11.
Source: Shibariumscan.io
The press time price of Shiba Inu stood at $0.0000248, with SHIB maintaining its position as the 12th ranked cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, which was around $14.6 billion at press time. 
Despite the transaction slowdown, SHIB has seen a price increase of 10% over the past month and a modest 2.44% rise over the last seven days. 
These price movements tell us that investor sentiment may still be relatively bullish on the second-largest meme coin.
The press time market sentiment towards Shiba Inu, as indicated by technical indicators, remained overwhelmingly bullish with an 83% bullish rating. 
Additionally, the Fear & Greed Index shows a score of 73, classified under ‘Greed’. The bulls were still in control.
How SHIB is doing now
Coinglass data showed that there has been a 19.24% drop in trading volume, coupled with a slight 1.58% decline in Open Interest.
This reflected reduced trading activity and potentially waning short-term interest among traders.

The recent market activity for SHIB demonstrates a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, as shown by the inconsistent trading volumes and uncertain market sentiment.

Read Shiba Inu’s [SHIB] Price Prediction 2024-2025

Given the current inconsistency and volatility shown in the chart, SHIB might continue to experience fluctuations with a slight bearish bias in the short term. 
Investors and traders should watch for either a sustained break below the 0.00002475 support or a rebound that pushes past the recent high for clearer direction.

Cardano's Hoskinson Predicts Crypto to Decide 2024 Elections - DailyCoin


        

Charles Hoskinson airs his frustrations against President Biden’s administration. 



The Cardano Founder makes eye-opening allegations and statements.



Hoskinson warns that crypto will be the kingmaker for the upcoming elections.




The US crypto industry has barely had time to catch its breath in its intense multi-year battle with the current administration. The relentless push for onerous regulations and regulatory crackdown on digital assets has driven countless companies to seek friendlier shores, costing the US economy trillions in potential revenue.



As the industry continues its exponential growth and increasing influence, Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson claims President Biden’s staunch anti-crypto stance might cost him another term in the White House.



Hoskinson Notes There’s a Systematic Effort to Hurt the Industry



Charles Hoskinson does not mince words when it comes to his dissatisfaction with President Biden’s administration and its anti-crypto stance. In his latest social media post, the Cardano founder aired his frustrations, vividly depicting the industry’s tireless efforts to engage with key decision-makers. 




He noted that the crypto community has spared no effort in fostering understanding, highlighting numerous policy meetings, private dinners, and open letters as part of their efforts. However, despite these endeavors, regulators remain persistent in their campaign against the industry.



The crypto pundit pointed to high-profile cases, such as Robinhood, Coinbase, Binance, and Uniswap, all receiving Wells notices from the SEC, as evidence of regulators’ systematic effort to hurt the crypto industry. 



While expressing his frustrations, the Cardano founder singled out Senator Elizabeth Warren as the driving force behind the current administration’s anti-crypto stance.



Hoskinson Singles Out Sen. Elizabeth Warren 



The Cardano founder raised eyebrows by suggesting a clandestine pact between President Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren. He insinuated that Biden brokered a deal with Warren to drop out of the presidential race in exchange for control over domestic treasury policy.




Hoskinson added that Warren, known for her staunch anti-crypto stance, extended her influence into the treasury department, handpicking people who shared her distaste for the crypto industry, leading to an administration that heavily leaned anti-crypto. 



The crypto pundit lamented the prevailing anti-crypto narrative, and actions painted crypto as fundamentally harmful to the American people. This perception, he argued, effectively labeled a vast portion of the population as criminals.



“53 million Americans, regardless of their politics and preferences, are soft criminals,” Hoskinson claimed. 



The Cardano founder conveyed deep concern over the repercussions of this hostile environment, citing that many of his friends, including Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, are currently in jail because of it. 



He expressed a sense of defeat, suggesting little hope for the industry. 



Hoskinson Claims Crypto Will Be Kingmaker



The Cardano founder noted the dichotomy of the Biden administration’s inviting crypto companies to register and engage in dialogue without providing a solid and transparent regulatory framework for them to do so effectively. He underscored the urgent need for clarity and consistency in regulation to ensure the industry’s legitimacy and growth.



Amidst his frustration, Hoskinson offered an eye-opening insight: the potential political ramifications of the administration’s anti-crypto stance. 



“If this President loses his job and crypto is the decider, no Democrat running in 2028 will be anti-crypto,” Hoskinson asserted. 



The Cardano founder further noted that the current administration is campaigning against the crypto industry because it believes there are no political consequences to its actions. Hoskinson emphasized that it is up to the voters to create that political consequence by voting President Biden out. 



Hoskinson ended his video by emphasizing the pivotal role of voters in shaping the political landscape, highlighting the importance of electing officials who embrace crypto. He envisioned a future where the next generation of congress members, senators, and presidents are crypto natives, paving the way for a more inclusive and progressive regulatory environment.



On the Flipside




In response to Biden’s anti-crypto stance, former President Donald Trump promised support for the besieged US crypto industry. 



At press time, only 17% of Americans have invested in digital assets. 



Charles Hoskinson believes the current administration has a hidden agenda of integrating CBDCs called Chokepoint 2.0. 




Why This Matters



The crypto industry will certainly play a deciding factor in the upcoming elections. As the industry faces numerous punitive measures and crackdowns, frustrations against the current administration have reached an all-time high. Charles Hoskinson’s prediction carries significant weight in this context.Genesis’ Chapter 11 plan greenlit:Court Clears Genesis’ $3B Bankruptcy Plan Despite DCG Objection.Will Kraken delist USDT?Kraken Mulls Delisting Tether’s USDT From the EU Market

In November 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated a lawsuit against Kraken. The SEC alleged it had been operating an unregistered securities trading platform. This suit came months after settling charges over Kraken’s former staking service.In February 2024, Kraken filed to dismiss the lawsuit, contending that it relied solely on a registration-based argument regarding Kraken’s operation as an unlicensed securities entity. Kraken argued that cryptocurrencies listed as SEC-compliant should be treated like commodities and not securities.However, now Kraken has escalated its position, urging the court to dismiss the claims to avoid a “significant reordering” of the US financial regulatory structure, according to court filings submitted in the Northern District of California on Thursday.The SEC filed an opposition to Kraken’s motion to dismiss, asserting that its enforcement action falls within its congressionally granted authority. They emphasize its role in enforcing registration requirements for securities intermediaries. Kraken urged the U.S. court to dismiss the SEC claims against it to avoid a “significant reordering” of the US financial regulatory structure.There has been discussion over stablecoins Tether’s USDT and USD Coin USDC specifically exploring which one is safer.  In April, USDT’s market capitalization of $104 billion is more than triple USDC’s $32 billion market capitalization. Part of the delta can be attributed to the network effect. USDT launched in 2014, whereas USDC launched in 2018, long after USDT became a popular asset for trading pairs on crypto exchanges. The exchange role in USDT’s dominance is evident in daily trading volume in which USDT trading volume is 7.5 times as high as USDC trading volume.

Well-known economist and fierce Bitcoin BTC/USD critic, Peter Schiff, tried downplaying the cryptocurrency's recent surge, highlighting its underperformance relative to silver.What Happened: Using a previous April 3 post as a reference, Schiff underlined how the King Crypto has grown only 2% since then, while silver racked up gains of 21% in the same period.At his usual taunting best, the precious metals advocate addressed the pro-Bitcoin crowd, saying, "That’s more than 10x the bang for your buck with silver. Bitcoin is dead. Long live silver."Well-known cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen responded to Schiff's post with a GIF saying, "Cherry picking of data is an old problem."Why It Matters: Schiff has been criticized for coming up with small timeframe windows as per his liking to highlight Bitcoin's weaknesses and exaggerate the performance of assets he supports. Over a longer period, though, Bitcoin was seen outperforming the white metal. Year-to-date, the apex cryptocurrency jumped 58% in value, while silver grew by 35%. In the last year, Bitcoin has surged nearly 150%, dwarfing silver's gains of 34% in the same time. In a cheeky retort, a user digged out one of Schiff's old posts from 2018 and highlighted how Bitcoin surged over 1000% since then while gold—another precious metal that Schiff heavily endorses—grew by less than 60%. While the bullion market gains in 2024 have been noteworthy, few assets are presently matching Bitcoin’s remarkable climb this year, driven largely by its increased exposure to traditional markets via spot ETFs.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $$66,698.41, down 0.80% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Vitalik Buterin Says ‘Proud’ Ethereum Doesn’t Censor Critical Views, Social Media Users Complain The Reality Is Opposite

Tether Mints $1 Billion in USDT, Paving the Way for Bitcoin's Next All-Time High



                    

Tether‘s USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, has minted another $1 billion, raising its market capitalization to over $110 billion. 



This could potentially drive Bitcoin to new all-time highs.




In the past 24 hours, Tether’s treasury minted $1 billion worth of USDT, bringing its annual total to $31 billion. 



According to a May 17 post from Lookonchain, this significant minting contributed to Bitcoin’s price rise from $27,000 to $73,000.



Tether is also directly investing in Bitcoin. 



The company plans to invest 15% of its net profit in Bitcoin to diversify its stablecoin’s backing assets. 



As of March 31, Tether had acquired 8,888 BTC worth $618 million, making it the seventh-largest Bitcoin holder globally, per Bitinfocharts. 



Currently, Tether’s wallet holds over 78,317 BTC, valued at more than $5.18 billion, one year after announcing its diversification plan.



Bitcoin’s price movements are also influenced by institutional investments in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 




According to Dune, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have seen over $200 million in net inflows over the past two weeks.

These institutional inflows have been crucial to Bitcoin’s current rally to new all-time highs. 



By February 15, Bitcoin ETFs accounted for about 75% of new investments in Bitcoin as it crossed the $50,000 mark.



On May 16, Bitcoin’s price confirmed a breakout on the daily chart, with $65,000 acting as strong support, according to TradingView. 



Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted in a May 16 X post that Bitcoin had turned its old resistance into support on the monthly chart, indicating a bullish trend.



However, Bitcoin might still experience a temporary correction to below $63,500 before reclaiming the $70,000 psychological mark. 



ScorehoodAI’s prediction algorithm suggested a pullback to around $63,000-$63,500, calling it a healthy correction to liquidate high-leveraged positions. 



A drop below $63,500 would liquidate over $1.76 billion in leveraged long positions, and under $63,000, liquidations would reach $1.87 billion, according to Coinglass data.

BNB Coin Price Hits Critical Support Level: Is a Rebound on the Horizon?


																BNB price started a downside correction from the $585 zone. The price must stay above $570 to start a fresh increase in the near term.

BNB price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $585 resistance zone.
The price is now trading below $580 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $570 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance).
The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $570 support.

BNB Price Holds Support
After a decent increase, BNB price struggled near the $585 resistance. As a result, there was a bearish reaction below the $580 support, like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
The price dipped below the $575 support and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It traded as low as $571 and is currently consolidating losses. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $570 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair.
There was a minor upward move above the $575 level. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $586 swing high to the $571 low. It is now trading below $580 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
Immediate resistance is near the $578 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $586 swing high to the $571 low. The next resistance sits near the $582 level.
Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com
A clear move above the $582 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $588. A close above the $588 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $600 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $612 level in the coming days.
More Losses?
If BNB fails to clear the $582 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $572 level and the trend line.
The next major support is near the $562 level. The main support sits at $550. If there is a downside break below the $550 support, the price could drop toward the $532 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $525 level.

Venezuela Pulls Plug on Crypto Mining to Prevent Grid Overload - DailyCoin


        

The Venezuelan national power grid is under a lot of stress due to increasing demands.



The government has taken action against high-consumption activities like crypto mining to alleviate pressure on the power grid.



The government has banned all crypto mining to regulate the country’s power grid. 




Crypto mining emerged as a beacon of hope for many grappling with Venezuela’s skyrocketing inflation and economic instability. With electricity costs among the lowest in the world, crypto mining offered a lifeline to citizens and businesses seeking financial refuge. 



Yet, as the allure of crypto mining in the country grew and more Venezuelans turned to digital assets, the strain on the country’s power grid became palpable. Faced with this dilemma, the government could no longer ignore the impact on the nation’s energy resources, prompting an unfortunate but much-needed response. 



Venezuela Bans Crypto Mining



Amid Venezuela’s struggle with energy shortages and infrastructural challenges, the Venezuelan National Power Ministry announced plans to disconnect all Bitcoin and crypto mining farms from the national grid. 




The agency explained that it aimed to regulate excessive energy consumption by banning all crypto mining farms in the country from the national grid. 



Spearheading this initiative, Rafael Lacava, governor of Carabobo, led a series of decisive actions resulting in the seizure of over 11,000 ASICs and the shutdown of numerous mining farms.



Governor Lacava has also prompted public collaboration in detecting illegal crypto mining operations in the country, encouraging citizens to report any unlawful activities.  




Lacava emphasized that such measures were essential to stabilize the country’s power grid and offer reliable service to its citizens, especially since the country has been experiencing recurring blackouts since 2019, which have had far-reaching implications for overall economic activity. 



While the authorities have yet to clarify the permanence of these actions, Governor Lacava warned that the national grid would disconnect more bitcoin farms and undertake other measures, including announcing a national executive order to reduce the energy consumption of state agencies in the next few days.



On the Flipside




In March 2023, Venezuela’s energy supplier shut down crypto mining facilities nationwide as part of corruption investigations involving the country’s state oil company.



A recent crackdown in Venezuela involved the confiscation of 2,000 crypto mining ASIC in Maracay as part of an anti-corruption initiative.




Why This Matters



Crypto mining emerged as a saving grace for countless Venezuelans grappling with soaring inflation and instability. Yet, this lifeline came at a cost—frequent blackouts and energy shortages. While the ban aims to restore stability to Venezuela’s energy infrastructure, it poses a dilemma for those dependent on crypto mining for their livelihoods.Will Kraken delist USDT from its exchange?Kraken Claims “No Plans” to Delist USDT From EU ExchangeCharles Hoskinson predicts crypto to be kingmaker for 2024 elections:Cardano’s Hoskinson Predicts Crypto to Decide 2024 Elections

Will This Week’s Economic Events Rattle Crypto Markets?


																The highlights of the economic week ahead are the Federal Reserve meeting minutes and a big earnings report from semiconductor giant Nvidia.
There are also reports on global manufacturing and services indexes and consumer inflation expectations which could influence markets a little.
Economic Calendar May 20-24
Last week saw the U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) cross the 40,000 mark for the first time. The stock rally was boosted by favorable figures in the CPI report, which ignited speculation that the US economy is cooling and that the central bank may cut rates in the next few months.
The minutes of the Federal Reserve FOMC May meeting will be revealed on Wednesday this week. These may offer more insight into monetary policy going forward and a projected rate-cut timeline.
On Thursday, May’s Global Manufacturing PMI preliminary report will be released, capturing business conditions in the manufacturing sector.




May 23 also sees a similar PMI report for the services sector. This is a crucial leading indicator since the services sector is responsible for over 70% of the total US GDP and a signal for changing economic conditions.
Friday, we will see May’s Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, which measures inflation expectations. These reports portray the results of a monthly survey of consumer confidence levels in the country.


Wednesday also has a highly-anticipated quarterly revenue report from semiconductor giant Nvidia which could keep tech stocks and crypto on a roll.
“Bulls want Nvidia to extend the run into record highs, and bears want Nvidia to mark the top,” commented the Kobeissi Letter on May 19.
Markets in Asia ticked up on Monday, May 20, tracking Wall Street gains. Investors in the region are awaiting their own sets of economic data this week with eyes on Japan for inflation data and South Korea for a rates decision.
Crypto Market Impact
With no major economic events this week, it is unlikely that crypto markets will be heavily impacted, and volatility is likely to remain low.
Crypto markets were buoyed last week, with total capitalization topping $2.5 trillion and holding gains over the weekend. They have dipped a little over the past 24 hours, however, with a 1.2% decline.
Bitcoin fell to an intraday low of $66,000 but found support there and returned to $67,000 at the time of writing during Monday morning’s Asian trading session.
Ethereum has dropped 1.3% on the day in a fall back to $3,078 after reaching a weekend high of $3,142. The altcoins were predominantly in the red this Monday morning.

                        Judge Sean Lane greenlit Genesis Global’s Chapter 11 plan on Friday, allowing the defunct crypto lender to repay creditors roughly $3b in crypto and cash.In a win for customers, the judge’s decision paves the way for Genesis to return frozen assets finally. Withdrawals have been halted on the platform since Nov. 2022, following the downfall of other major crypto firms.Bloomberg reported that Judge Lane dismissed Digital Currency Group’s (DCG) legal challenge, stating that Genesis’ parent company lacked the authority to contest the Chapter 11 plan. As an equity holder of Genesis, DCG stands last in line for repayment, according to Judge Lane. The judge noted that creditors are prioritized ahead of DCG and are not receiving full repayment.Genesis’ parent company, DCG, might challenge Judge Lane’s decision in court.Bitcoin Boom Triggers Legal Battle as Genesis Clashes with DCG Over Windfall
A surge in crypto prices since Genesis’s bankruptcy filing has sparked a fight between the lender and its parent company, DCG. Their disagreement centers on who gets the windfall, with Bitcoin jumping from around $21,000 in Jan. 2023 to $67,000 today.On Friday, Genesis attorney Sean O’Neal disagreed with DCG’s claim that customers could receive payment “in full” considering the lower crypto prices observed in Jan. 2023.“Given the size of the creditor claims, DCG is out of the money as an equity holder by billions of dollars,” Judge Lane said.Bitcoin Stability Key to Genesis Fulfilling Creditors’ Claims in Bankruptcy
Genesis anticipates being able to fulfill claims from a minimum of 77% of its customers. This is contingent on Bitcoin’s value remaining stable. However, it faces even more obligations to state and federal regulators for $32b.Most creditors who were owed money approved the lender’s bankruptcy plan. This involves participants in Gemini Earn. Genesis operated this lending program with Gemini Trust Co., which is owned by the Winklevoss twins.Genesis is prioritizing returning crypto to customers wherever possible. However, it lacks enough crypto to fully repay everyone it owes.In February, Genesis received approval to sell its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares valued at more than $1.3b, as part of efforts to repay customers.

Former Binance CEO CZ Zhao Plans to Write During Four-Month Prison Term



                    

Former Binance CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, plans to “write something” during his upcoming four-month prison term. Judge Richard Jones sentenced Zhao on April 30 to four months in prison after he pleaded guilty to one felony charge for failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at Binance. 



Zhao is expected to serve his time either at the Federal Correctional Institution Sheridan in Oregon or the Federal Detention Center SeaTac in Washington, though the reporting date was not determined at the time of publication.




Despite his legal troubles, CZ has remained active on social media. 



He launched Giggle Academy, a youth-focused crypto and blockchain education program, and engaged with his 8.9 million followers on X, seeking suggestions on how to pass the time in prison.



With a net worth of $33 billion, CZ would be one of the wealthiest individuals to serve time in prison. 




His legal team argued that his wealth and status could make him a target for theft and extortion, potentially influencing the judge’s decision to allow him to remain free until the Probation or Pretrial Services Office decides his reporting details.



During this period, Zhao has kept himself busy, mentioning on X that he has “nothing else to do” but read books and wait for his reporting date.

He pleaded guilty in November 2023 and has since been free on a $175 million bond, restricted to travel within certain U.S. areas.




The Federal Bureau of Prisons is likely considering which facility would be safest for Zhao, given that both FDC SeaTac and FCI Sheridan house violent offenders. 



According to the Probation or Pretrial Services Office of the Western District of Washington, presentence reports help the Bureau designate suitable institutions, select prison programs, and develop case plans for custody and eventual release.



In November, Zhao paid a $50 million penalty as part of a deal between Binance and U.S. authorities. 



Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion to settle civil regulatory enforcement actions, though this did not resolve a separate lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

                        LayerZero Labs has identified a total of 800,000 addresses as potential sybil addresses, rendering them ineligible for the full token allocation.Initially, the team had identified over two million addresses as potential sybils, but they later refined their criteria to minimize false identifications.In a recent post on X, the team announced the end of the sybil self-reporting phase in their initiative to combat sybil activity, commonly known as “airdrop farming.”The project aims to address the issue of users creating multiple fake accounts to gain unfair advantages in token allocations.According to LayerZero, addresses meeting the specified criteria will receive 15% of their expected token allocation, while the remaining 85% will be redistributed to eligible users.LayerZero Reveals List of Sybil Addresses
The complete list of addresses, including both self-reported ones and those identified through initial examinations conducted by LayerZero, Chaos Labs, and Nansen, has been made public.On May 3, LayerZero introduced a self-reporting mechanism, offering sybil users 15% of their planned token allocation as a reward for honesty within a defined 14-day period. The team clarified that the initial analysis aimed to identify large-scale industrial sybil clusters and that the released list aims to exclude these clusters from bounty hunting eligibility.However, it should be noted that the list is not considered definitive until the final report is published, as addresses may be removed or added as calculations are refined.The sybil bounty hunting process commenced on May 18 at 2:00 pm UTC and will continue until May 31, 11:59 pm UTC.Participants are required to report a minimum of 20 addresses along with a clear methodology to be eligible for a reward of 10% of the intended token allocation for each reported sybil address.The bounties will be awarded to the first eligible reporter of a specific address.The LayerZero team is continuously working to improve the accuracy of their methodology, but the initial list of identified addresses will remain unchanged throughout the bounty hunt.Bounty hunters can proceed with their work without concerns about the initial list, as the final and authoritative list will be shared once the bounty hunt concludes.Sybil Farming Becomes Prevalent
Sybil farming, the act of creating multiple fake accounts to unfairly acquire tokens or rewards, has become a prevalent issue in decentralized finance protocols.Airdrops, which reward early users with newly issued cryptocurrencies, are widely employed by these protocols to generate more engagement.LayerZero’s ZRO was the first Hyperp (Hyperliquid-only perp) to launch on the HyperLiquid perpetual futures decentralized exchange in September 2023.Instances of sybil farming have been observed in the crypto space before. In 2022, Optimism disqualified over 17,000 suspected wallets engaged in sybil activity from its airdrop, accounting for 6.83% of eligible wallets.Similarly, in September, a network named ZkSync Era discovered 21,877 wallets involved in sybil farming activities, where the wallets were transacting a closed-source token among themselves using a private decentralized exchange.

                        Ripple’s recent report highlights Professor Massimiliano Sala’s call for new cryptographic systems to protect blockchain from quantum computing threats.In an interview with Ripple, the mathematics professor at University of Trento explained that current encryption methods might be vulnerable to quantum computers as they evolve. He emphasized the importance of developing ‘quantum-resistant’ cryptographic systems.Ripple and Professor Address Quantum Computing Threats
When addressing the industry’s future, Sala highlighted the vulnerabilities quantum computing introduces to blockchain security. He noted that quantum computers could solve problems foundational to digital signatures, threatening blockchain platforms.“Quantum computers could easily solve problems that are foundational to digital signatures, thus potentially undermining the mechanisms that protect users’ assets on blockchain platforms,” said Sala.Despite these concerns, he pointed out the proactive efforts within the cryptographic community to develop “post-quantum” cryptographic schemes, aiming to secure blockchain systems against quantum attacks.According to Sala, the transition to quantum-resistant cryptographic systems is vital for maintaining the integrity and security of blockchain infrastructures.“All classical public-key cryptosystems should be replaced with counterparts secure against quantum attacks,” said Sala.Technical Challenges and Educational Need
He also elaborated on the technical difficulties, such as increased computational demands and larger data sizes for secure transactions. Yet, Sala remained optimistic about the ongoing research to optimize these implementations for practical use.Sala praised international collaboration efforts, such as the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardization process, which promote the creation of cryptographic standards resistant to quantum attacks.He stated that this collaborative approach could ensure new schemes undergo rigorous community-wide evaluation, enhancing their reliability and security.In addition, Sala suggested the integration of modern cryptographic methods into traditional academic curricula for education, targeting the emerging challenges in the sector.“The probability of quantum threats materializing may not be imminent,” said Sala. “But it is significant enough to warrant proactive measures.”

Finnish-American software engineer Linus Torvalds, who is best known for creating the Linux operating system, does not believe in cryptocurrencies, according to his recent forum post.  The 54-year-old computer scientist slammed the newfangled asset class as a "great vehicle for scams." He also went on to mention that cryptocurrencies function as a typical Ponzi scheme that aims to find "the next sucker holding the bag.""Nor do I believe in Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, or the Easter bunny," he quipped. A Satoshi candidate? It is worth noting that the godfather of the open-source movement, who has also created the distributed version control system Git, was once rumored to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Torvalds, who created the Linux kernel when he was 21, had the necessary set of skills for coming up with the idea of Bitcoin, which made him one of the likely candidates. The rumors were fueled by Torvalds allegedly changing a single name in the Linux Kernel to "Name = I am Satoshi" back in January 2022.However, Torvalds explained that it was simply a "jokester" who took advantage of GitHub's modus operandi to make it seem like their git object was in his tree.  He went on to clarify that the rumors were just "empty noise," adding that he was not the owner of a huge Bitcoin fortune. No technological singularity In his post, Torvalds also rejected the idea of technological singularity, dismissing it as a "bedtime story for children". "But unlike the very hungry caterpillar, it also makes for great click-bait stories that you can make up," he joked.Even though the legendary computer scientist admits that it is a great sci-fi concept, continuous exponential growth does not make sense to him. "We are very much seeing the limits getting closer," Torvalds added.

This is Why Bitcoin DeFi Could Be the Next Big Thing


Bitcoin developers are exploring the next growth frontier, i.e., programmability through decentralized finance (DeFi). Recent developments suggest that Bitcoin’s adaptability could soon rival Ethereum’s, potentially catalyzing significant market expansion.
Following the launch of the first US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the latest Bitcoin “halving,” the community has turned its focus toward the future of Bitcoin’s ecosystem. 
Bitcoin Developers Work on Enabling Programmability

The spotlight is now on DeFi’s potential to transform Bitcoin from merely digital gold into a more dynamic, programmable platform. Toby Lewis, the co-founder of the Ordinals project – OrdinalsBot, believes that the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could grow to be the largest in the entire crypto ecosystem.
Currently, the Bitcoin total value locked (TVL) stands at $1.137 billion.

“It is possible that the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could grow to trillions of dollars of market cap over the next few years, and it appears to be one of the major drivers of growth in crypto this cycle.”

Traditionally, Bitcoin has been viewed as a store of value with limited functionality beyond investment. Unlike Ethereum, which supports a rich ecosystem of apps and smart contracts, Bitcoin has lacked these capabilities. However, developers are now pushing to bridge this gap through innovative solutions.
One of the most talked-about advancements is the introduction of Bitcoin layer 2 networks such as Lightning, which aim to enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and utility for applications like payments. Despite previous setbacks and vulnerabilities, the community’s relentless pursuit of robust and secure solutions has led to the development of groundbreaking protocols.
In 2023, the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol marked a significant milestone by enabling the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This was further expanded by the proposal of BRC-20 tokens by an anonymous developer known as Domo. These tokens leverage a similar inscription mechanism, significantly enhancing Bitcoin’s programmability.
Developers are also exploring other avenues, such as OP_CAT, a potential software upgrade that could simplify the implementation of programmability on the Bitcoin network. This proposal is under review, with significant backing from the developer community.

However, integrating programmability into the Bitcoin network has its challenges. The recent launch of the Runes protocol, which facilitates the creation of altcoins on the Bitcoin blockchain, initially surged network activity, but later, the hype cooled down.

At its peak, the Runes transaction crossed 1 million on April 23. However, as of May 19, the number of transactions is down to 56,372.

Ether Price Surges 5.5%, Nears $3,100 Amid Market Optimism and Legal Boost



                    

On May 17, Ether’s price surged by 5.5%, nearing $3,100 for the first time in ten days. Analysts attributed this rally to a decline in demand for fixed-income instruments following stagnant U.S. retail sales data for April. 



This data heightened market expectations of a potential interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy.




Expansionary measures by the central bank are typically seen as bullish for risk-on markets, due to increased monetary supply or reduced credit costs for businesses and individuals. 



Investors sought exposure to scarce assets, including cryptocurrencies, leading to gold reaching $2,410, just 0.8% below its all-time high.



A U.S. Department of Justice indictment unsealed on May 15 also boosted Ether’s surge. 




The indictment accused two individuals of wire fraud and money laundering by manipulating the Ethereum blockchain. 



The document stated that “Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain […] without the need for a trusted intermediary” and added, “No central actor runs the Ethereum Network.”



Additionally, the court noted that Ethereum smart contracts enable transactions without a trusted intermediary. 



These statements boosted Ether investors’ confidence, especially after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Wells notice to Robinhood on May 4 over alleged securities violations related to crypto listings and custodian operations.




Orlando Cosme, founder and CEO of Lexproof, remarked that this verdict contradicts regulators’ classification of ETH as a security, “as there would be no management or entrepreneurial efforts of others.”

While this analysis does not change the approval odds of U.S. spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), it certainly lifted investors’ spirits.



The U.S. SEC is expected to provide its final ruling on VanEck’s spot Ether ETF request on March 23 and rule on the conversion of Grayscale’s ETHE fund by June 18. 



Although analysts predict approval odds below 35%, the regulators’ case for classifying Ether as a security instrument has weakened, contributing to the rally above $3,050 on May 17.



Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko praised Ethereum’s network security, highlighting how coordinating “an invalid state transition or double spend attack” would be nearly impossible. 



In a May 17 post, Yakovenko added that layer-2 scaling reduced costs without compromising security due to the network’s large number of validators and operators.



Investors realized that Ethereum’s setbacks, including high transaction fees and slow scalability efforts, were decisions prioritizing security and decentralization. 



Meanwhile, competitors Solana and BNB Chain opted for higher processing capacity solutions, increasing dependency on fewer entities.



Ethereum’s strength is evident in its dominance in decentralized application (DApp) activity. 



The growth of layer-2 solutions such as Base, which gained traction due to its low fees and integration with Coinbase, reinforces Ethereum’s potential as a global settlement layer.



Ethereum’s $181.5 billion in DApp volume over 30 days is more than seven times larger than its direct competitor, BNB Chain.



This volume declined merely 3% compared to the previous month, while BNB Chain and Solana experienced 52% and 41% decreases, respectively.



Analyzing unique active addresses engaging with DApps yields similar results, with Ethereum gaining 3% in 30 days, while BNB Chain and Solana faced steep declines. 



Highlights from the Ethereum network include Balancer, which saw a 34% volume increase, Morpho Optimizers with an 80% gain, and DODO with a 61% boost.



In essence, even if U.S. spot Ether ETF approval odds remain low, the network’s dominance in the DApp ecosystem remains unaffected.



This realization contributed to the ETH price gains on May 17.

Weak Correlation, Security Issue Hamper Spot Ethereum ETFs


As the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nears its decision on spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), skepticism grows among crypto industry experts. They highlight concerns over the complex links between Ethereum (ETH) futures and spot markets and potential security issues.
This skepticism dims the outlook for these ETFs’ regulatory approval.
Potential SEC Roadblocks for Spot Ethereum ETFs Approval

Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, highlighted the necessity for SEC approval on both a 19b-4 change in trading rules and an S-1 registration statement for any ETF launch. However, the process may face delays, especially in S-1 approvals, even if 19b-4s get approval.
In a separate discussion, James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, expressed strong doubts about the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. He pointed to the weak correlations between futures and spot markets observed in 2021.
Read more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works

“Overall, I think it’ll be something somewhat objective that just kicks the can down the road. […] If I had to guess, I’d say correlations. Primarily pointing to the futures and spot correlations from 2021, which were quite weak over 1 min and 5 min intervals,” Seyffart said.


Seyffart further explained the possibility of the SEC by stating that “the futures market hasn’t been sufficient on a 3-year look back period for detecting fraud and manipulation in the spot market.” It is important to note that the same argument got the agency sued by digital asset manager giant Grayscale.
However, Seyffart emphasized that this is just a complete guess. He said a better timeline will be revealed “when we see these 19b-4 orders and the SEC’s official correlation analysis data.”
Proof-of-Stake Mechanism and Staking Complexities
Furthermore, security classification concerns form another significant hurdle. Scott Johnson, a general partner at Van Buren Capital, highlighted that the SEC is considering treating Ethereum as a security in the upcoming spot ETF order.
The current law requires the SEC to provide “notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration.” This cited question was asked and noticed in all the Ethereum filings. Yet, Johnson believes the SEC never asked such questions when filing a Bitcoin ETF.

“The obvious purpose is to potentially deny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they are holding a security,” Johnson said.

David Han, an institutional research analyst at Coinbase, added another layer of complexity to the debate. In a recent report, he points out the differences between Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) and Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanisms.

He mentioned the regulatory environment for asset staking remains unclear, especially for spot Ethereum ETFs that allow staking. Han argued that the risks associated with staking, such as slashing conditions, validator client variations, fee structures, and liquidity issues, make it unlikely for the SEC to approve spot Ethereum ETFs soon.

This perspective aligns with recent adjustments by ARK Invest and 21Shares. The firms reportedly amended their spot Ethereum ETF application to remove clauses related to staking. Initially, they aimed to stake Ethereum (ETH) held by the firm, which would have counted as income for the fund.
The SEC’s upcoming deadlines to respond to spot Ethereum ETF applications from VanEck and ARK Invest are May 23 and 24, respectively. As the SEC deliberates, the crypto community watches closely. They are eager to see if the SEC addresses these hurdles or further delays the spot Ethereum ETFs’ introduction to the market.

Magic Eden's Coinbase Account Used to Bear "Significant" Dust Fees - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The platform shifted small transaction fees to Magic Eden’s Coinbase account, making Coinbase handle the consolidation costs.



Coinbase integrated 92,400 small inputs a day from Magic Eden, resulting in significant fees and losses.




In a recent revelation, Danny, the founder of Deezy, highlighted on social media platform X, that NFT marketplace Magic Eden executed a clever maneuver against Coinbase. Danny described this move as one of the “most hilarious finesse moves” he had seen.





Magic Eden’s Coinbase Account Leads to Exchange Losses



Magic Eden‘s strategy involved attaching tiny outputs for marketplace fees to each transaction. These small outputs, ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 satoshis, are inexpensive to create but costly to consolidate later. This clever tactic shifts the burden of managing these outputs onto Coinbase rather than Magic Eden itself.



Instead of using its own address to collect these small unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), the platform directed them to Magic Eden’s Coinbase account. Consequently, these numerous small deposits went into Magic Eden’s Coinbase account, making the exchange responsible for the integration and consolidation fees.



Controversial Tactics in Crypto Transaction Management



Supporting this, Mempool founder @mononautical noted that in the past 24 blocks, Coinbase Prime had to integrate 92,400 small transaction inputs from Magic Eden’s address. These were spread over 308 transactions, incurring fees at a rate of approximately 7 satoshis per virtual byte (sats/vB). The total cost amounted to roughly 0.59 BTC in fees to recover about 1.75 BTC.




This scheme resulted in significant losses for Coinbase, attributed to its large scale and slow response. Danny commented that Coinbase, due to its size and operational sluggishness, failed to recognize and efficiently manage the consolidation of these transactions, leading to substantial financial losses.

Quant Analyst PlanB Says Bitcoin Flashing ‘2017 Vibes,’ Hints at Final Chance To Accumulate BTC Below $70,000 - The Daily Hodl


								Well-known quant analyst PlanB says that Bitcoin (BTC) looks the same as it did in 2017 before witnessing a meteoric ascent.
PlanB tells his 1.9 million followers on the social media platform X that BTC is currently four months into its bull market phase, indicated by the four red dots on his chart.










“2017 vibes.”
Source: PlanB/X
Based on PlanB’s chart, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap was trading at around $1,200 when it was at its fourth red dot in 2017 but quickly rallied to the $20,000 mark by the end of the year.
The quant analyst is also looking at different variations of Bitcoin’s realized cost price indicator, which measures the value of a given cohort’s coins at the price they were last transacted. PlanB’s chart shows three variations of the metric including the five-month, two-year and total realized cost price of BTC.
The analyst’s chart also shows that BTC’s price is above all three metrics, suggesting that we may be seeing the final days of BTC trading at current levels.

PlanB also says that based on the historical correlation between miner revenue and price action, BTC should go “vertical” later in 2024 as the industry’s revenue recovers from the halving.
“Historically, Bitcoin miner revenue recovers two to five months after a halving, and after that Bitcoin price goes vertical.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,105.

Why Bitcoin could hit $60,000 before a rally to $72,000 - AMBCrypto



A crucial resistance at $68,000 could trigger a BTC pullback.
While the coin might recover to $72,000 later, the price might trend higher.

AMBCrypto’s market analysis revealed that Bitcoin’s [BTC] jump to $67,740 does not mean that the price would no longer nosedive. In fact, there is a chance that BTC could drop to $60,000.
To arrive at this conclusion, the liquidation heatmap came into play. The liquidation heatmap helps traders to prevent further losses. High liquidation areas could be support or resistance areas.
North is not the only way
According to data from Coinglass, there was a big cluster of liquidity from $67,626 to $68,000, indicating that Bitcoin could approach the levels one more time.
On the downside, there was a major level at $60,160. As such, resistance between $67,000 and $68,000 could force BTC to drop to $60,000 which could later act as support.
Source: Coinglass
However, the most concentrated area of liquidity was $72,000, meaning that the next uptrend could push Bitcoin to this point. Establishing this bias was the Realized Price.
Realized Price measures the average price divided by Bitcoin’s supply. This helps to understand the economic state of the coin. Like the liquidation heatmap, this metric can act as on-chain support or resistance.
Bitcoin is not back to the bear market
If the Realized Price hits or crosses Bitcoin’s value, it means that the coin has fallen into a bear phase. For example, the metric flipped BTC in November 2022, confirming a crash in the price.
As of this writing, the Realized Price was $29,142— two times less than the press time value. With this position, one can infer that BTC has not hit the top of this cycle.
Source: Glassnode
In addition, we assessed the SOPR Ratio. SOPR stands for Spent Output Profit Ratio. By definition, SOPR measures the profit ratio of the entire market.
The value of this metric is calculated as the division of the long-term holder’s SOPR by that of the short-term holder. A high SOPR ratio means higher profits for long-term holders than short-term holders.
If this is the case, it means that the market is close to the top. Conversely, a low SOPR ratio indicates that short-term holders have made more gains than their long-term counterparts.
At press time, the ratio was 2.08. Falling to this level suggests that Bitcoin’s price can move higher. For example, the ratio hit the same reading before Bitcoin’s all-time high in March.
Source: CryptoQuant
Furthermore, the current state of the metric implied that BTC could rally again. This time, a move to $72,000 could be validated.

But as mentioned earlier, the first step to hitting the region could be a correction to $60,000.
In the meantime, BTC could undergo a consolidation phase first. After that, more liquidity could flow out of the coin which could propel the downturn before the upswing.

Ethereum SEC Coin (ETHSEC) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Ethereum SEC Coin (ETHSEC) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Ethereum SEC Coin (ETHSEC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because ETHSEC has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Ethereum SEC Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Ethereum SEC Coin could become the next viral memecoin.



Ethereum SEC Coin launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Ethereum SEC Coin on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Ethereum SEC Coin by entering its contract address – DeCpC881FwUmN4HrwHdxTXCfMiSoo69BLMWavA5DjoJd – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ETHSEC.

Ripple's Stablecoin Set For 'Great Impact': Top Economist


								In a recent contribution for Finextra, Carlo R.W. de Meijer, an independent economist and owner of De Meijer Independent Financial Services Advisory (MIFSA), provided an in-depth analysis of Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin launch. De Meijer, with nearly four decades of experience at institutions such as ABN, ABN AMRO, and the Royal Bank of Scotland, describes the initiative as a potential “game changer” for both the crypto sector and traditional finance (TradFi).
On April 4, Ripple unveiled its plan to introduce a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, aiming to be a crucial development in bridging traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). This move has been positively received across both sectors, reflecting rising institutional interest in the stablecoin market. De Meijer remarked, “Ripple’s stablecoin launch is expected to be a game changer for the XRP Ledger ecosystem.”
Ripple’s stablecoin will be backed by a combination of US dollar deposits, short-term US government bonds, and high-grade commercial paper, ensuring transparency and reliability. The reserves will undergo periodic audits by a reputable third-party accounting firm, with monthly attestation reports made public. This “compliance-first” approach aligns with global regulatory standards, a strategy designed to maintain trust among Ripple’s primary clientele of institutions and governments.
The stablecoin will initially launch on both the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum blockchain, adhering to the ERC-20 token standard. This dual launch is intended to enhance adoption and utility across different blockchain ecosystems. Ripple plans to expand to additional blockchains and DeFi protocols over time, emphasizing interoperability and seamless interaction between various networks.
What The Economist Expects From Ripple’s Stablecoin Launch
Integrating the stablecoin with major cryptocurrency exchanges could increase its accessibility and liquidity, facilitating easier trading and wider adoption by individual users. However, no decisions have been made on which exchanges it will initially trade on.

The initial launch will target the US market, focusing on enterprise customers and banking institutions. De Meijer notes that regional variations for markets in Europe and Asia might follow, driven by demand from emerging markets for stablecoin payouts.
Ripple’s shift to stablecoins for US transactions highlights the ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP and should be seen as a response to regulatory challenges. “By offering a stablecoin backed by dollar based reserves, Ripple aims to provide a regulatory-compliant alternative to XRP, thereby mitigating concerns related to regulations and investor protection,” de Meijer remarks.
He identifies several strategic motivations behind Ripple’s stablecoin initiative. One primary driver is the enhancement of the XRP Ledger ecosystem. The issuance of a stablecoin is expected to attract more users, boost liquidity, and drive the development of new financial applications.

Ripple envisions its stablecoin as a pivotal asset in expanding its digital payments footprint, strengthening its strategic position, and forming new financial market alliances. The stablecoin is also intended to enhance Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, addressing the volatility issues associated with XRP. This stablecoin could enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of ODL, enabling rapid transactions and providing a more stable asset for financial institutions and DeFi ecosystems.
Moreover, this development could unlock new opportunities for institutional and DeFi use cases across various industries, driving more adoption and development within the XRPL ecosystem.
Despite the ongoing legal battle with the SEC, Ripple remains optimistic about launching its stablecoin by the end of the year. De Meijer highlights that the introduction of a stablecoin could pave the way for new applications beyond cross-border payments, such as remittances, micropayments, and various DeFi activities.
This could increase demand for XRP and stimulate the growth of the XRPL ecosystem. The stablecoin’s compliance with high regulatory standards and its integration into major crypto exchanges could further bolster Ripple’s market presence.
De Meijer believes the stablecoin could revolutionize cross-border payments, enhance the functionality of the XRP Ledger ecosystem, and solidify Ripple’s position as a leading force in the blockchain and digital currency sectors. [The launch] may have a great impact on both the crypto world as well as the traditional financial world, further narrowing the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi),” the economist concludes.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.51603.

XRP Ledger doubles transactions in Q1 amid SEC case


The XRP Ledger (XRPL) recorded a 108% surge in on-chain transactions in the first quarter of 2024. 



The XRPL’s transactions exceeded 251 million, with a notable decrease in average transaction fees by 45%. 



XRPL transactions increase from roughly 121 million in the last quarter of 2023 to over 251 million in the first quarter of 2024. 



Daily spot trading volumes on major exchanges have risen by 40%, with Binance, Bybit, and Upbit leading the pack, accounting for more than 70% of the total volume.

	
	
	
	


Meanwhile, the XRPL’s integration with platforms like Axelar has expanded developers’ access to smart contracts and decentralized applications, connecting them to over 55 blockchains.



This uptick in network activity occurred as Ripple Labs, the company that has built its payments infrastructure around the XRP cryptocurrency, nears the conclusion of its legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.



The SEC is seeking a US$2 billion fine. 



Ripple is pushing for a significantly lower penalty, not exceeding US$10 million.

SEC on the Clock: Will Ethereum ETFs Finally Get Approved?


							

SEC deadline for Ethereum ETFs looms this week.



Approval could boost Ethereum adoption, trading.



Delay raises concerns about crypto regulation.




The SEC faces a crucial deadline this week to decide on the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Ethereum, according to a social media post by Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store.



Geraci, an industry expert on ETFs, highlighted the SEC’s two-pronged review process in his online post. The process requires approval of both the 19b-4 filings, which address exchange rule changes, and the S-1 registration statements. Both filings are essential for bringing Ethereum ETFs to market.



Geraci expressed concern that the SEC might delay approval of the S-1 filings even if the 19b-4 filings are greenlit. This speculation stems from the SEC’s recent lack of engagement on the issue, and the inherent complexities of cryptocurrency products. Such delays would allow listing of the ETFs, but they could not be traded until the S-1 filings receive approval.



The SEC’s decision on Ethereum ETFs is keenly awaited. Approval could facilitate broader mainstream adoption of Ethereum, offering a more regulated and secure investment option for cryptocurrency investors.









Conversely, delays or denials could underscore continuing regulatory anxieties regarding the stability and security of cryptocurrency investments. A key question remains: Is Ethereum a security or a commodity? While SEC Chair Gary Gensler has declined to comment on ETH’s classification, he has suggested in public appearances that it might be considered a security.



The SEC’s decision will be a bellwether for the future of cryptocurrency regulation. Approval of Ethereum ETFs could signal a shift towards a more accommodating regulatory environment, potentially boosting investor confidence and propelling Ethereum further into the mainstream. However, a rejection or delay could cast a shadow over the industry, raising questions about the regulatory viability of other cryptocurrency-based investment vehicles.

Hong Kong trials digital yuan for retail and cross-border payments


The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced Friday the launch of a digital yuan pilot program.



The digital yuan, or the e-CNY, allows retail transactions and cross-border payments within the city.



It is designed to offer a digital alternative to cash payments for Hong Kong residents while integrating China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) into its financial system.



The pilot allows residents to create digital yuan wallets linked to their mobile numbers and fund them via 17 local banks using the Faster Payment System (FPS). 

	
	
	
	


This collaboration between the FPS and the Digital Currency Institute of the People’s Bank of China is the first time any CBDC has connected with a rapid payment system.



The e-CNY wallets are expected to gain more functionalities as merchant adoption grows, facilitating wallet top-ups without the need for a mainland bank account.



The program sets transaction and balance limits to regulate the digital yuan’s circulation and ensure financial stability. 



Individual transactions and daily spending are capped at 2,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan, respectively, with a maximum wallet balance of 10,000 yuan. 

	
	
	

	


These controls are intended to manage usage and maintain economic equilibrium.



The digital yuan has facilitated 1.8 trillion yuan (US$250 million) in transactions recorded as of June 2023. 



Over 10 million merchants across 17 provinces and cities in mainland China now accept the digital currency.



The HKMA’s future plans include enhancing e-CNY wallets with real-name verification and exploring corporate applications for cross-border trade settlements.

Ethereum dev’s paid EigenLayer role sparks debate on ‘conflicted incentives’

An Ethereum Foundation researcher’s decision to take a paid adviser role for the foundation behind EigenLayer has sparked criticism on social media, with one commentator suggesting it could create “conflicted incentives.”In a lengthy May 19 X post, Ethereum researcher Justin Drake disclosed he had taken an adviser role at EigenFoundation that “comes with a significant EIGEN token incentive” vested over three years worth “millions of dollars” and “more than the combined value of all my other assets.”EigenLayer is a protocol that partially launched on mainnet last month and allows users to stake liquid staked Ether (ETH) tokens — which are derivative tokens for ETH staked in a protocol such as Lido — effectively allowing ETH to be staked twice.Drake said he took the role on the condition he was limited to researching restaking risks and claimed his default stance would “continue to lean critical of EigenLayer” while acknowledging the role “inevitably comes with downside risk beyond my personal reputation.”“By being an adviser, I hope to have a front-row seat to restaking issues and steer EigenLayer from within,” Drake wrote. “I feel I did too little, too late with regard to liquid staking. This is an opportunity not to repeat the mistake with restaking.”A day earlier, crypto trader and UpOnly co-host Jordan Fish, who goes by Cobie, asked Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin his thoughts on Ethereum Foundation staff “taking life-changing [monetary] packages” from projects that “may have conflicted incentives with Ethereum” — giving EigenLayer as a theoretical example.Source: Jordan FishOn the other hand, others including Polygon vice president of governance Hudson Jameson, zkSecurity co-founder David Wong and Standard Chartered ventures crypto investments director Robbie Nakarmi praised Drake for being transparent.Related: Is onboarding too hard? Crypto adoption still faces major obstaclesIn his X post, Drake aimed to quell claims that EigenLayer is “trying to systematically ‘bribe’ or ‘corrupt’” the Ethereum Foundation.“The EF is a large organization with 300+ people,” he wrote “To my knowledge 3 EFers have a formal relationship with EigenLayer entities: one as an early EigenLabs investor, and two as recent EigenFoundation advisors.”He added he didn’t “see the 1% of EFers formally involved with EigenLayer compromising their morals” and that he was also ready to “end the advisership at any time” such as if EigenLayer went in a direction “against Ethereum’s interests.”Earlier in May, EigenLayer airdropped 28 million more of its EIGEN token to users after it faced backlash from users claiming its program was too restrictive.Magazine: Ethereum restaking — Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?

JackTheRippler acknowledges XRP is the next Bitcoin


							

Cyrpto analyst contends XRP as the next Bitcoin, reflecting on CEO’s earlier remarks.



XRP’s value could rise if regulatory challenges addressed



XRP up 4% in a week, trading volume surges 27%




JackTheRippler, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst recently echoed the optimistic views of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on the future of the company’s native token, XRP



In a social media post, JackTheRippler pointed to Garlinghouse’s previous interview with Bloomberg, where the CEO discussed the potential of XRP. Garlinghouse acknowledged that XRP’s value could rise if certain challenges are addressed.







The analyst’s post is based on Garlinghouse’s previous interview with Bloomberg, where he elucidated the future of Ripple’s native token, XRP. While the host enquired about the potential of XRP to become the next Bitcoin, Garlinghouse shared his optimistic views. He asserted that XRP’s value could be raised if the prevailing problems are sorted. He cited,




 “If we work with the system to solve this problem and the problem is in trillions of dollars, then there is a great opportunity to create value in XRP.” 




Some experts have pointed out XRP’s past performance as evidence of its potential. The token reportedly surged by about 25,000% in 2017. However, Garlinghouse’s suggestion that XRP could surpass Bitcoin in the future remains a topic of debate within the cryptocurrency industry



Garlinghouse also addressed the ongoing concern about regulatory uncertainty in the crypto space. He emphasized Ripple’s commitment to regulatory compliance, highlighting their collaboration with regulators and financial institutions.









Despite a recent downturn with its price currently at $0.5131, XRP has seen a notable increase of over 4% in the past week. Additionally, a substantial 27% surge in trading volume suggests a rise in demand for the token.



Overall, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain. While some analysts see it as a potential contender, others believe it is unlikely to replace Bitcoin.

5 of 7 on-chain indicators suggest the bull run is just beginning

Despite crypto markets having consolidated sideways for the past three months, at least five on-chain indicators suggest the bull market may just be getting started, according to an analyst. Since the end of February, the total market capitalization of crypto has been range-bound at around $2.5 trillion. Market observers are conflicted about whether the cycle is already over or not.These five on-chain indicators, as highlighted by analyst “ELI5 of TLDR” in an X post on May 19, suggest it is just beginning.Source: ELI5 of TLDRBitcoin market dominance above 56%Historically, crypto bull markets start with a high level of Bitcoin (BTC) dominance, with most traders selling their altcoins during the prior bear market cycle.On the other hand, when BTC dominance drops and altseason begins, it signals the next stage of the bull cycle, bringing it one step closer to its end, but this doesn’t seem to be the case just yet.

Silver has staged an impressive comeback against Bitcoin in 2024, surpassing the cryptocurrency as the eighth-largest asset by market cap after losing its position in March.

PEPE prices at risk? Here's what the week holds for the memecoin - AMBCrypto



PEPE was the best-performing memecoin last week. At press time, it was among the worst-performing.
Bears appeared to be in control, but indicators suggest that the decline is likely temporary.

Everyone’s favorite memecoin is currently in a bit of a bind. PEPE, the Solana-based memecoin that made a lot of people millionaires last week, has been dropping, not so slowly for about three days now. 
At press time, it has tumbled by over 8% in the last twenty-four hours just as the community was starting to cheer for memecoin season. What is going on? Why is PEPE backsliding?
Reasons for PEPE’s descent
PEPE rallied by over 500% at some point last week. But it wasn’t an isolated trend. Meme stock legend Keith Gill made a comeback on social media, sending both meme stock markets and memecoin markets into a frenzy.
Traders lost it. Investors jumped in. But just as it came, the hype went away, along with Gill. Now the coins and the stocks have cooled down by a mile, with PEPE’s daily chart painted in red.
Source: TradingView
The PEPE/USDT chart shows a notable bearish trend throughout the session, with price action marked by a series of red candles. Such a sharp decrease, supported by high volume, typically indicates that bears are in control. 
This could potentially drive the price down further unless there is a significant change in market dynamics or external influences that could encourage the bulls to flip the script.
Data from Coinglass showed that the trading volume for PEPE has increased by 14.02% to $697.64 million, suggesting a heightened trading activity and possibly a growing interest in PEPE among traders.
However, the open interest has seen a decrease of 10.09%, standing at $105.29 million, which might indicate that some traders are closing their positions, focused solely on taking profits.
Source: Coinglass
What to expect from PEPE this week
If PEPE holds above the 0.00000900 support and sees increasing buyer volume, along with a bullish MACD crossover and an RSI recovery above 30, there could be a potential for a short-term price recovery.

Realistic or not, here’s PEPE’s market cap in BTC’s terms

The RSI was below the 30 mark at press time, meaning that PEPE is in an oversold condition.
Should these indicators align positively, PEPE could see a recovery in the near future, testing higher resistance levels. All in all, the memecoin seems to be in consolidation mode, so the decline could be just temporary.

Why Is The Crypto Market Down Today?


The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) and Bitcoin’s (BTC) price took a short break over the weekend from the ongoing rally. Although the intra-day candlestick is green, the bearishness from the last two days has also been extended to today, keeping the overall growth minimal.
This has impacted Pyth Network (PYTH), which is currently experiencing a drawdown on the daily chart.
In the news today:-

Genesis secures court approval to distribute $3 billion to its creditors, enabling the users impacted by the bankruptcy to receive 77% of their claims.
Crypto exchange Kraken’s Global Head of Asset Growth and Management, Mark Greenberg, reassured that they have no plans to delist Tether (USDT) in Europe.


The Total Market Cap Is Facing Resistance
The total market capitalization is presently at $2.36 trillion, just under the resistance of $2.40 trillion. This resistance has been tested twice in the past, and TOTAL has failed to breach it. 
This is the current situation, and TOTAL might also observe some struggle to breach it again. The dip noted over the weekend did not hurt the recent growth. However, the green candlestick from the intra-day trading did not initiate recovery either, keeping TOTAL at the same mark it was at two days ago.

Extended bearish cues will only bring TOTAL down to $2.29 trillion, which has been a key support floor in the past.

Bitcoin’s Price Rise Halts
Bitcoin’s price is above $67,100 at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency witnessed a minor dip in the last two days, which resulted in the ongoing rise experiencing a short pause. The 1.26% growth observed today has recovered most of the dip, but Bitcoin is still performing only slightly better than yesterday.
The chances of BTC’s price action in the future is consolidation between $68,500 and $64,800. This will continue until either of the levels is broken through or below.

However, a fall below $64,800 will invalidate any chances of a bullish outcome. Instead. it could further extend the decline to $63,700.
Pyth Network Hits Four-Month Low
Pyth Network’s price has been consistently declining for the last two months. Following the cues of BTC and the rest of the market, PYTH fell by 13% on Sunday. As a result, the altcoin is trading at $0.38, which is above the key support of $0.35.

If this support is lost, the decline will continue. On the other hand, if PYTH bounces back from this support, a recovery to $0.46 is possible. Breaching this will invalidate the bearish thesis.

Cat Wif RPG (CATRPG) Will Surge 11,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Cat Wif RPG (CATRPG) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Cat Wif RPG (CATRPG), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Cat Wif RPG presents a similar opportunity.



Cat Wif RPG has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days before it will be listed on KuCoin – a massive cryptocurrency exchange – and Cat Wif RPG could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Cat Wif RPG can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Cat Wif RPG on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Cat Wif RPG by entering its contract address – GZiCTFbVMumaRv8PPCXv721vLSQdKb9x4WfizzB4Z8eG – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CATRPG.

                        A group of developers believes introducing programmability to the Bitcoin blockchain could drive the next rally for the largest cryptocurrency.While Bitcoin is currently seen as digital gold, with its primary use being a store of value, developers argue that the addition of programmability would unlock a range of functionalities and applications.Unlike its rival Ether, which allows for the creation of smart contracts and the development of decentralized applications on the Ethereum network, the Bitcoin blockchain lacks the ability to support such features.Over the years, developers have attempted to address this limitation by creating “Layer 2” networks like Lightning, aimed at scaling Bitcoin for payment applications.However, many of these solutions have proven unreliable, and the associated bridges, used to transfer tokens between networks, have been susceptible to hacks, leading to user apprehension.Developers Work on Enhancing Bitcoin’s Programmability
Despite the lack of widespread adoption for payment purposes, developers have recently made progress in enhancing Bitcoin’s programmability.Projects like Bitcoin Ordinals, which enable the creation of non-fungible tokens by embedding data onto satoshis (the smallest denomination of Bitcoin), have paved the way for further advancements.The introduction of BRC-20 tokens, proposed by an anonymous developer named Domo, has sparked a search for ways to enhance Bitcoin’s programmability even more.Proposals like OP_CAT, a potential software upgrade to the Bitcoin network, are being considered to facilitate easier implementation of programmability.Startups like Arch, which recently raised $7 million in funding, and the Layer 1 Foundation are actively working on solutions to enable greater programmability in Bitcoin.Arch aims to run an application platform on top of Bitcoin, potentially allowing apps from the Solana network to be ported onto Bitcoin.The Layer 1 Foundation is developing a programmable module for the BRC-20 metaprotocol, which enables the storage and execution of code on the Bitcoin blockchain.These initiatives have attracted the interest of around 20 developer teams who are building apps for borrowing, lending, decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, and more.TVL on Bitcoin DeFi Market Amounts to $1 Billion
While some members of the Bitcoin programming community remain skeptical about the future of Bitcoin’s programmability, believing that Layer 2 solutions will prevail, these new ventures are betting on the potential influx of decentralized finance (DeFi) apps on Bitcoin.Currently, the total value of tokens locked in the Bitcoin DeFi market amounts to about $1.1 billion, significantly lower than Ethereum’s $52.7 billion.However, proponents of Bitcoin’s programmability envision a future where the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could rival or surpass Ethereum’s, potentially driving significant growth in the crypto market.It is worth noting that some analysts have turned bullish on Bitcoin following weeks-long consolidation.Leading trading firm QCP Capital has expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s price momentum, forecasting a potential return to the highs of $74,000.In a recent note, the firm said it has observed substantial buyers acquiring 100,000 to 120,000 BTC Calls for December 2024, indicating confidence in the upward movement of the cryptocurrency.Likewise, technical analyst Rekt Capital believes that Bitcoin has emerged from the post-halving “danger zone” and entered an accumulation phase, as indicated by weakening selling pressure.

Pump Fun Implodes: Ex-Employee Turned Hacker Exposes Alleged Shady Practices


								Jarett Dunn, the alleged hacker behind the Pump Fun exploit, secured bail after his arrest in London. Dunn, known online as StaccOverflow, is accused of draining nearly $2 million from the Solana-based memecoin marketplace on May 16th. However, in a surprising twist, Dunn isn’t pleading innocence.
Instead, he’s claiming the real crime lies with Pump Fun itself.

Pump Fun: Alleged Heist Or Robin Hood Act?
Pump Fun aimed to capitalize on the memecoin craze sweeping the crypto world. However, the platform remained obscure until Dunn’s alleged hack thrust it into the spotlight.
While details remain scarce, Dunn, posting from a different online account while in custody, claims he plans to challenge the prosecution (“argue with the crown” in his words) by portraying Pump Fun as the true criminal.
It’s interesting to note that Dunn’s arrest followed his last social media post on X, in which he revealed his identify in a subtle way. According to his own post on X and the intelligence company, Dunn was freed on bond after his detention.


Dunn’s accusations paint a picture of a potentially fraudulent operation. He alleges Pump Fun functioned as an unregistered securities exchange or gambling site, lacking proper licensing. Furthermore, he claims the platform failed to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, raising red flags about potential illegal activities.
His claims extend beyond financial regulations. Dunn alleges Pump Fun blacklisted in Saudi Arabia for operating as a casino and accuses them of misleading investors by presenting a minimal staff structure while potentially employing overseas workers.
Solana is now trading at $177. Chart: TradingView
The most shocking accusation involves insinuations of “child abuse intentions,” though Dunn offers no concrete evidence beyond the possibility of a subpoena for Telegram communications.
Crypto’s Wild West: Hacks, Refunds, And Legal Battles
The legitimacy of Dunn’s claims remains to be investigated. However, the case highlights the often-murky ethical landscape surrounding crypto hacks.
Dunn isn’t the first hacker to challenge the status quo. In 2021, the infamous Poly Network hack saw the return of over $610 million in stolen funds. This incident suggested a hacker with a conscience, returning ill-gotten gains.
Unresolved Questions And A Murky Future

The Pump Fun hack case raises more questions than it answers. Will Dunn’s accusations hold any weight in court? What were his true motives for the hack? Does his defense strategy represent a new frontier in crypto crime, where hackers become self-proclaimed enforcers against perceived injustices within the system?

Smart Ethereum Whale Started Selling Profits After a Long Time! Estimated Profit: 171 Million Dollars! - Bitcoin Sistemi

This week is critical for Ethereum. Because the SEC will announce its decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications.
While the general consensus is that the SEC will not approve spot ETH ETFs, ETH whales have also taken action.


According to Lookonchain's post, the giant whale, which collected 120 thousand ETH at approximately $ 1,600, started selling profits.
At this point, the whale, who deposited 15,000 ETH worth $46,000 million in Kraken, made a total profit of $171 million from his ETH investment.






“A giant whale worth 120,874 ETH ($370.6 million) deposited 15,000 ETH ($46 million worth) on Kraken 3 hours ago.
This whale had withdrawn 120,874 ETH ($199 million) from Kraken between August 31, 2022 and September 9, 2022 at $1,647.
Currently, the whale has 105,874 ETH left (worth $325.3 million) and his profit is $171.5 million.”

Etheruem, which fell to $ 2,800 last week, accompanied the rise in Bitcoin and rose above $ 3,000 again.

Bitcoin Pizza Week: Crypto Spent On 2 Yummy Pies 14 Years Ago Could Now Buy Jeff Bezos' Yacht And Elon Musk's Jet Fleet - With Spare Change! - Benzinga

Hurray! Bitcoin BTC/USD Pizza Week is finally here, reminding us of the time when this prized digital currency was used for the first time for commercial purposes. But do you know that the Bitcoin spent on two Papa John’s pizzas that day could purchase you ultra-luxury products owned by billionaires today? What Happened: An event immortalized in the cryptocurrency realm, Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida-based programmer, disclosed on a Bitcoin Forum on May 22, 2010 that he "successfully traded" 10,000 Bitcoins for pizza.According to the conversation on the Forum, 1 Bitcoin was worth $0.0041 on the historical day, taking the total purchase amount to $41. Seems a long time ago, isn’t it?Why It Matters: Cut to May 2024 and Bitcoin has exploded since its early days. It is the largest digital currency in terms of market cap as of this writing, with 1 Bitcoin worth more than $67,000, according to data from Benzinga Pro.That takes the total worth of 10,000 Bitcoins to nearly a whopping $670 million.So, if our dear friend Laszlo had resisted using up his Bitcoin holdings to pay for Pizzas that day, he could have easily purchased Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos' superyacht ‘Koru.' The $500-million sailing boat made waves last year due to its humongous size and high operating costs. Interestingly, Hanyecz would still have been left with $170 million, more than enough to buy the entire fleet of Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk's private planes, which are valued at over $100 million.These events help in understanding Bitcoin's stupendous growth trajectory over the last decade, making the fortunes of several of its loyal enthusiasts who stuck with the asset through the highs and lows of the market.Read Next: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum Retrace On Profit-Taking By Retail Investors: Analyst Predicts Parabolic Rise For King Crypto Following Consolidation Phase

XRP: the latest news on Ripple's cryptocurrency

In recent days, the price of XRP, the Ripple cryptocurrency, has slightly increased, probably due to some positive news that circulated last week. 

The trend of XRP and the latest crypto news on Ripple
Currently the price of XRP is about $0.51.
This is a price level in line with that of October 2023, before the recent bull run started.
However, it is also the price level it had in June of last year, and it turns out to be lower than that of the beginning of 2021. 
Actually, it is even in line with that of October 2018, so much so that it could even be stated that the price of XRP has been moving sideways around the half dollar for almost six years now, although during this period it has not been at all still. 
In 2017, before the great bull run that brought it to its historical highs of $3.8 in January 2018, its price was just under $0.3, so the current price is only 70% higher than it was seven years ago. 
When the first major speculative bubble burst in 2018, the price of XRP first dropped to 0.5$, and then fell below 0.3$. The worst, however, came in the following years, with a decline to 0.15$ in March 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic. 
In the rest of 2020, it managed to approach 0.3$ again, before jumping up to almost 0.7$ by the end of the year. However, at that point the SEC started the lawsuit against Ripple and XRP, and during the great bull run of 2021 the price failed to exceed 2$. 
With the burst of the second bubble in 2022, the price of XRP returned to around $0.3, and since then it has continued to fluctuate between $0.3 and $0.7 with a very brief exception in July 2023 thanks to the favorable ruling in the lawsuit against the SEC. 
Current trend
During 2024 it first dropped from $0.63 to $0.5, then rose to $0.71 but only to fall back to $0.48 in April. In the last month it has fluctuated within a very narrow range, between $0.48 and $0.56.
Starting from May 7th, it had begun a descent that brought it down to $0.49 last week, before rebounding slightly and bringing it back above $0.52 last Friday. 
Yesterday, however, it slightly dropped to 0.50$, before rising back up to 0.51$ today. 
Practically in the last twelve days it has fluctuated between $0.49 and $0.52. 
So even though last week saw a small rebound, it is simply normal movements within the sideways range that has been going on for two months now. 
Furthermore, even extending the analysis a little further back in time, it has been since July of last year that it has not been well above $0.7. However, at least it has been more than a year since it has not fallen below $0.48. 
The crypto news on Ripple (XRP)
Given that it has been twelve months since nothing really interesting has happened to the price of XRP, neither positively nor negatively, recent news has only been able to move it within the sideways trading range. 
Surely last week the good news about inflation in the USA also had positive consequences on the price of XRP. However, they were not able to unlock the crypto market, now relatively flat for some weeks.
One interesting thing has happened. 
Indeed, according to Santiment data, XRP whales (wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP) have increased the total number of XRP held by a whopping 110 million, thus increasing their wealth in this cryptocurrency by about 55 million dollars in just the last two weeks. 
This suggests a period of accumulation. 
Furthermore, on-chain transactions have increased by 108% in the first quarter of 2024, with a total of 251.39 million transactions in three months on the XRP Ledger. 
This is a number not much lower than that of the Ethereum blockchain, which however does not include transactions on layer-2.
What is surprising, however, is the cost of transactions, because on the XRP Ledger the average cost in the first quarter was only $0.000856 per transaction, while on Ethereum it is more than a thousand times higher. 
Quantum computing
In addition, yesterday Ripple published an article regarding the potential issues that cryptocurrencies could face due to quantum computers. 

The article concerns the insights of Professor Massimiliano Sala, a mathematics professor at the University of Trento in Italy, regarding the impact of quantum computing on blockchain. 
According to Sala, quantum computers could easily solve fundamental problems for digital signatures, potentially undermining the mechanisms that protect users’ resources on blockchain platforms. 
However, Sala also highlighted the progress made by the cryptographic community towards the development of “post-quantum” cryptographic schemes designed to resist potential attacks carried out using quantum computers. 
It is therefore a real problem, although not current, and well known, for which some possible solutions are already known. 
However, Sala advises crypto organizations to start transitioning to quantum-resistant technologies now, because although such threats are not imminent, they would be significant enough to justify proactive measures. 
In this regard, Ripple is organizing a national XRPL Hackathon involving over 20 universities and 60 developers from November 21st to 23rd, 2024 in Rome.

Bitcoin Worth $1B Transferred By Just Paying $7.30 In Fees: Can Traditional Banking Carry Out Such A Feat? - Benzinga

A mammoth transfer of more than a billion worth of Bitcoin BTC/USD, accomplished by paying a fraction in fees, grabbed the market's attention, leading to discussions around the nature of the transfer.What Happened: In a social media post on X, well-known Bitcoin influencer Vivek highlighted a transaction showing the movement of 16,445.82 units of Bitcoin, worth $1.1 billion at current market prices. The fascinating bit was that the transfer was performed by paying just around $7.30 as transaction fees.The sheer size of the transfer left on-chain observers in awe, with Vivek predicting it to be a purchase by a nation-state.Another popular cryptocurrency analyst, MartyParty, informed that the withdrawal was from cryptocurrency exchange Binance, possibly going to a new buyer, or cold storage as a safety measure.Why It Matters: Typically, such mammoth transfers, when executed using the traditional finance system, cost an order of magnitude higher. According to a report by Coinbase, crypto international money transfers were found to be 96% cheaper than the legacy process of sending money abroad. Apart from the cost advantages, crypto transfers could also cut settlement time significantly. While it may take anything between 1-10 days before the recipient gets the money through traditional transfers, the average wait time for crypto transfers was just 10 minutes. Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $67,180.06, an increase of 0.02% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Peter Schiff Says ‘Bitcoin Is Dead, Long Live Silver’ But Is It Really True?

Finiko's $55 Million Crypto Ponzi: Executive Sentenced to 3 Years


The Vakhitovsky District Court of Kazan has sentenced Lilia Nuriyeva, a key participant in the notorious Finiko Ponzi scheme, to three years in prison. 
Nuriyeva was found guilty of defrauding private investors and participating in an organized criminal community, reflecting the gravity of the charges brought against her.
How Crypto Ponzi Scheme Finiko Conducted $55 Million Scam

Finiko, often compared to the infamous MMM Ponzi scheme, lured investors with promises of high returns through a purportedly unique cryptocurrency and stock market trading system. The scheme, masterminded by Kirill Doronin, operated from 2018 until its collapse in 2021, leaving a trail of financial devastation. 
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the scheme caused over 5 billion rubles (~ $55 million) in damages.
The investigation revealed that Doronin and his accomplices traveled across Russia, conducting master classes to attract thousands of investors. They promised substantial returns through an “automatic profit generation system,” persuading people to invest by taking out loans and selling their homes.

Initially, investors received dividends paid in Bitcoin, which they could withdraw. However, the launch of Finiko’s own cryptocurrency saw its value plummet within a month, wiping out investors’ savings.
In 2021, the Central Bank identified Finiko as a financial pyramid, listing it among companies with signs of illegal activity. Despite this, the scheme continued to attract significant investments until its abrupt collapse. 
Offices nationwide closed, and the company’s website went offline. Doronin assured investors it was a technical glitch, but investigators later found that his associates had fled abroad with the funds.
One investor, Lyudmila Yamshchikova from Kazan, recounted her ordeal to the Russian outlet – Izvestia. 

“Payments suddenly stopped. I invested nearly a million [rubles], intending to use the interest to pay off my mortgage. Half of the city was buying apartments, cars, and paying off loans. But then withdrawals were blocked,” Yamshchikova said.

Nuriyeva’s sentence was notably lenient due to a pre-trial agreement. She will spend only three years in the prison. Initially, she faced up to ten years in prison.

Currently, Doronin and nine other accomplices are in pre-trial detention. They face charges of organizing and participating in a criminal community and large-scale fraud. The General Prosecutor’s Office approved their indictment, and the case was sent to the Vakhitovsky Court on April 27.

The Financial Crimes and Enforcement Network (FinCEN) identified Finiko as one of Bitzlato’s top three receiving counterparties. Bitzlato, a Russian P2P exchange, saw its founder charged with money laundering by the US in 2023.

Optimistic price predictions for the crypto Solana (SOL)

Some recent forecasts indicate that the price of the crypto Solana (SOL) could rise towards $170, with the possibility of reaching $1,000 by June. 
In addition, Solana leads the market with 91 million daily transactions, surpassing Ethereum, according to a report by CoinGecko.
On the other hand, Phantom Wallet has reached the third place in the utility category on the Apple App Store, and many cryptocurrency experts see this as a bullish indicator for Solana. 
Let’s see below all the details. 

The crypto Solana (SOL) towards new price targets: forecasts by June
The crypto Solana (SOL) is currently trading at around $172.84, recording a decrease of 0.53% in the last 24 hours, with a daily trading volume of $2.19 billion. 
Ranked fifth, Solana has a market capitalization of $77.59 billion and a circulating supply of 448.92 million SOL coins.
On the 4-hour chart, the key pivot point is at $171.79, crucial for short-term price action. Immediate resistance is at $176.66, followed by $183.26 and $188.53.
On the downside, immediate support is at $165.72, with further levels at $156.75 and $151.08. The relative strength index (RSI) is at 73, indicating overbought conditions.
The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $155.79, supporting the overall bullish trend. The bullish channel confirms this trend, but the resistance around $175 could represent a significant barrier.
If Solana remains above the pivot point of $171.79, it could support its bullish momentum. However, a drop below this level could trigger a selling trend, bringing the price towards supports at $165.72, $156.75, and $151.08. 
The market response at these levels will be crucial in determining the short-term price direction. Solana’s technical outlook remains positive as long as it stays above the pivot point of $171.79. 
The immediate resistance at $176.66 will be the first obstacle to overcome, followed by $183.26 and $188.53. The high RSI suggests caution, as overbought conditions could lead to a pullback. 
The 50-day EMA at $155.79 provides a solid foundation for the upward trend currently in place.

Solana has proven to be the fastest blockchain among the main ones, processing an incredible number of 91 million transactions in just one day.
According to a recent update from CoinGecko, on April 6th Solana recorded a daily average of 1,504 transactions per second (TPS) during the memecoin frenzy.
This makes it 46 times faster than Ethereum and over five times faster than Polygon, which is the fastest scaling solution of Ethereum.
Despite its position as a leader in speed, Solana has only reached 1.6% of its theoretical maximum speed of 65,000 TPS. 
The increase in transactions has caused congestion on the network, raising questions about Solana’s ability to achieve higher real TPS after the upcoming updates.
The second fastest blockchain, according to the report, is Sui, another platform not based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which reached a real TPS of 854 in July 2023 thanks to the popularity of the on-chain game Sui 8192. 
Other non-EVM blockchains include TON with 175 TPS and Near Protocol with 118 TPS. On the other hand, Aptos has recorded 49 TPS, Starknet 12 TPS, Bitcoin 11 TPS, and Thorchain 2 TPS.
Non-EVM blockchains have outperformed EVM and EVM-compatible blockchains with an average peak TPS of 284, compared to just 74 average TPS of the 17 top EVM-based blockchains. 
Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has distinguished itself as the fastest among EVM blockchains, reaching a real TPS of 378 on December 7, 2023, thanks to the increase in on-chain activity. 
Polygon, the main scaling solution for Ethereum, reached 190 TPS on November 16, 2023, resulting in being 8.4 times faster than Ethereum itself.
Phantom Wallet conquers third place on the Apple App Store: what does it mean for Solana?
The cryptocurrency Phantom Wallet portfolio recently reached the third position on the Apple App Store in the utility category, just behind Google and Google Chrome apps.
Crypto commentators suggest that this rise could indicate a bullish future for the Solana (SOL) token, as Phantom Wallet was originally launched as an exclusive wallet for Solana. 
The cryptocurrency entrepreneur Evan Luthra commented on X on May 19 as follows:  
“It seems like the SOL season will be great! Which SOL coins should I buy?.” 
The crypto influencer Borovik has added: 
“Phantom wallet is the third most important utility app, I am so bullish on cryptocurrencies and Solana.”
Phantom Wallet has recently surpassed seven million monthly active users, as reported in a post on April 29 on X. The crypto community usually sees an increase in monthly users as a sign of broader adoption. 
Currently, Phantom Wallet is ranked 32nd among all categories in the Apple App Store, behind X and the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. Although initially designed for Solana, Phantom Wallet now also supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon.
The cryptocurrency trader Shear believes that if the exchange Coinbase, currently ranked 288th, and Phantom Wallet were to enter the top 10 of the Apple App Store, it could mark a market peak. 
Shear, in a post on May 18th, stated: 
“These are my favorite indicators, I will sell everything when they are both in the top 10.”

ETFs buy 3X new BTC supply - 5 Things to know in Bitcoin this week

Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week in fighting form as $67,000 returns with TradFi markets.The largest cryptocurrency is edging closer to a rematch with final resistance around all-time highs past and present at $69,000 and $73,800.Whether it gets there in the coming days is the main preoccupation facing market participants, and various factors could contribute to a bullish continuation.These include United States economic policy cues as the Federal Reserve releases minutes from its May meeting, while U.S. unemployment data is also waiting in the wings.When it comes to BTC price action, traders are getting ever more confident that a local bottom has come and that upside is what should result after two months of consolidation.Meanwhile, a refreshing divergence may be playing out — prices are higher, but sentiment is lingering around lower levels than during the March peak.Could a more sustainable journey to price discovery be on the cards?Against this backdrop, Cointelegraph takes a closer look at the issues surrounding Bitcoin markets this week.Bitcoin bulls keep up pressure below all-time highsBitcoin certainly feels back in business this week, returning to near $67,000 into the Asia session after briefly dipping into the weekly close, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.That brief spate of weakness accompanied geopolitical uncertainty from Iran, but markets soon forgot this as BTC/USD preserved its 10% May gains.The latest data from monitoring resource CoinGlass now shows that the bulk of immediate overhead resistance lies just below $68,000.BTC liquidation heatmap (screenshot).

Source: Michaël van de PoppeVan de Poppe nonetheless added that he expected altcoins to “outperform” while this was happening, these having suffered more acutely during Bitcoin’s consolidation phase.“Slow upwards grind, slowly but surely accelerating towards a vertical move in Q3/Q4,” a further post predicted.As Cointelegraph reported, however, not everyone shares these views. At the weekend, trader and commentator Credible Crypto revealed a belief that $60,000 or even lower should come next for BTC/USD.U.S. jobs data, Fed headline macro weekThe macro landscape will not be dominated by U.S. economic reports in the coming days.Instead, the Fed takes center stage in the form of a slew of speaking appearances from senior officials.While Chair Jerome Powell is not due to be among them, markets nonetheless watch the language used by governors and others for cues as to future policy.The minutes from the May meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, where interest rates were discussed, are due for release on May 22.Thereafter, U.S. jobless claims could provide another bout of volatility for risk assets, continuing a trend in May and previous months.At the same time, attention is increasingly focusing on favorable liquidity conditions in both the U.S. and beyond. In his latest X content, financial commentator Tedtalksmacro suggested that crypto bull run is “far from over” as a result.Tedtalksmacro flagged an early liquidity cycle now beginning, along with M2 money supply displaying “plenty of room to the upside for easing liquidity conditions.”“While liquidity is definitely back in crypto (BTC ETFs), the velocity of inflow has not yet seen a manic phase consistent with cycle tops,” he continued about crypto market trends.U.S. M2 money supply. Source: TedtalksmacroBitcoin ETFs preempt “new faith” in BTCTedtalksmacro touched on what could shape up to be a strong comeback from the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).After struggling for weeks on end since Bitcoin’s all-time highs in March, the spot ETF products are seeing renewed interest. Last week, inflows hit almost $1 billion — the best weekly performance since March.“Expect these to only increase as price drifts higher and tradFi once again renew faith in the asset,” Tedtalksmacro concluded.ETF demand lies within a new landscape. Bitcoin’s block subsidy is half of what it was in March, and large inflows cause the ETF providers to purchase much more BTC than that which is added to the supply by miners daily.“Bitcoin ETFs have purchased 21,700 BTC ($1.5B) in the month to date,” Thomas Fahrer, CEO of crypto reviews portal Apollo, revealed last week. “This is 3X the supply of new bitcoin from miners.”Bitcoin ETF net flows.

Source: CryptoQuant“Right on time for a second wave of ETF Flows,” Fahrer commented on the phenomenon, drawing attention to a combination of “demand shock” and “inelastic supply” going forward.“In 2021, during the peak of the bull market, approximately 2.7 million Bitcoin were held in exchange reserves, with Bitcoin trading around $69,000. Three years later, the reserves have decreased to about 2 million Bitcoin, yet the trading prices are nearing historical highs,” CryptoQuant contributing analyst meanwhile wrote in one of its Quicktake market updates last week. “The recent halving event has effectively cut the potential new supply from miners by half, significantly reducing the likelihood of new Bitcoin entering the market through sales. Given these dynamics, it becomes challenging to maintain a bearish stance on Bitcoin.”Sustainable greed?In what could become an encouraging sign for short-term market sentiment, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is not rushing to extremes on the current BTC price move higher.Related: Bitcoin preps ‘golden cross,’ which last sparked 170% BTC price gainsThe index, which uses a basket of factors to determine the sustainability of overall crypto sentiment, currently stands at 70/100.Crypto Fear and Greed Index (screenshot).

Dogecoin Founder Billy Markus has shared an important message to advertisers on social media platforms like X. Known as a vocal activist on X, the Dogecoin founder uncovered key reasons why users block ads that pop up on their timelines.Malware challengeAccording to the Dogecoin founder, users are less likely to block ads if advertisers on websites stop making a habit of creating pops up with malware and other nonsense. His comments come amid growing concerns regarding scams on social media platforms like X. Especially in the Web3 world, many people use social media as a major channel to connect with users, and scammers generally take advantage of this. On different occasions, crypto projects like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ripple have issued warnings to their communities to beware of bogus claims on X.As Billy Markus noted, advertisers are to blame for users blocking their ads. Reacting to the post by the Dogecoin founder, users noted that it remains more helpful if projects, websites or advertisers just stick to telling the truth about their offerings.Users will always need to protect themselves, especially in the crypto ecosystem, where one click on social media can lead to account draining.Solving scams in cryptoAs the digital currency ecosystem evolves, so too does the criminal activity grow more sophisticated. Just last week, U.Today reported that a Bitcoin whale lost a total of 1,155 BTC, marking one of the biggest heists of 2024.While many such related scams have been recorded over the past few years, there has always been one strategy to combat this unending fraud. This hinges on raising community awareness.Besides the regular sensitization from Shiba Inu and Ripple executives, Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson also recently joined the trend, shining the spotlight on the role of AI Deepfakes overall. The bottom line is, too-good-to-be true offers in advertisements are a potential fund drainer to beware of.

Daily Shiba Inu burn rate has demonstrated a substantial increase with several millions of meme coins transferred out of the circulating supply.SHIB burns increase overnightData published by the Shibburn explorer reveals that within the last 24 hours, the SHIB burn rate has staged a major rise of 62.58%.This way, the Shiba Inu community has successfully disposed of 6,985,600 SHIB meme coins in total thanks to ten burn transactions. The largest burn transfers registered by this tracker included 2,555,239, 1,500,000 and 1,045,369 SHIB.In the meantime, over the past seven days, the SHIB community has managed to get rid of 57,671,544 SHIB. However, this is almost 57% less than was sent to unspendable blockchain wallets a week before – the weekly SHIB burn rate is in the red. Overall, a staggering amount of 410,726,422,225,031 SHIB has been so far burned in total from the quadrillion supply created by Ryoshi when SHIB was launched in 2020. The supply of Shiba Inu that is currently circulating on the market equals 582,992,864,057,113 SHIB meme coins. 6,280,713,717,854 SHIB have been locked in staking platforms.Shiba Inu price performanceOver the period of the past 24 hours, the second largest meme cryptocurrency SHIB has staged a major decline of slightly over 4%, coming out of the range it had been moving for three days prior to that.Shiba Inu price has dropped from the $0.00002504 level to $0.00002397, where it is changing hands at the time of writing this article.cardShibarium transaction activity keeps plummetingThe Shibariumscan explorer shows a continuous decline in on-chain activity on this layer-2 solution.The daily transaction count has dropped to the 11,910 mark compared to 16,900 on Saturday. This is a more than 97% plunge compared to the 562,990 transactions spotted on Shibarium on April 17.As for the total count of transfers on this progressive blockchain platform, it has by now shown a rise to 417,490,509 with the number of connected wallets sitting at 1,803,114.The massive decline in transaction activity might be caused by the current upgrades implemented on Shibarium – last week the charismatic SHIB lead Shytoshi Kusama announced that finally a new version of the ShibaSwap dex has been bridged from the Ethereum blockchain to Shibarium, thus expanding the range of opportunities for SHIB users.

Ripple (XRP) Price Faces Decline: Buying Opportunity Near?


Ripple’s (XRP) price rallied to a one-month peak of $0.56 on May 6. But has since shed 9% of its value.
Although the altcoin remains at risk of a price decline in the short term, it may present a buying opportunity for traders looking to trade against the market. 
Ripple Has Little to Offer in the Interim
XRP currently trades below its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.51. The token’s price crossed under this key moving average on May 13, confirming the uptick in its sell-offs among market participants. 

When an asset’s price falls below its 20-day EMA, it signals that its value trades under its average price of the past 20 days. It is interpreted as a bearish signal and a shift in momentum from buying to selling. 
Market participants view it as a sign that an asset’s price might initiate a downtrend or continue to fall.

Further, readings from XRP’s Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) showed its MACD line (blue) resting below its signal (orange) and zero lines. 
This indicator identifies the changes in an asset’s trend or momentum during a specific period.

Ripple Price Analysis. Source: TradingView
When an asset’s MACD line is positioned under its signal and zero lines, it signals that its short-term moving average has fallen below its long-term moving average. It is a bearish sign; market participants view it as a sign to exit long and open short positions. 
XRP Price Prediction: Time To Buy?
XRP’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio observed using 30-day and 365-day moving averages posted negative values of -1.3% and -9.8%, respectively. This may be a good buying opportunity for those looking to buy the dip and trade against current market movements. 
The MVRV tracks the ratio between an asset’s current market price and the average price of its coin or token circulation. When an asset’s MVRV ratio is negative in this manner, it is undervalued because its current market price is less than the average purchase price of all its tokens in circulation. 

This is seen as a buy signal. It suggests that the asset in question currently trades at a price lower than its historical cost basis.

Further, XRP’s positive funding rates in its futures market suggest that traders continue to hold long positions despite the token’s recent price troubles. 

If XRP sees significant accumulation, the bulls may be able to push its price above $0.53 and toward $0.57.

However, if the current bearish trend gains momentum, the token’s value may fall under $0.5 to trade at $0.44.

Notcoin (NOT) Turns From Telegram Crypto Hype To Investor Tears In Just A Week On Intense Profit-Taking - Benzinga

A cryptocurrency heavily endorsed by social media giant Telegram turned out to be a dud in its opening week, leaving investors who bought into the hype with heavy losses. What Happened: Notcoin NOT/USD debuted on the Toncoin TON/USD network–another project closely linked with Telegram–last week after nearly $1 billion worth of tokens were airdropped to eligible investors, alongside high-profile listings on exchanges like Binance. Note that Notcoin is a Telegram-based game with an impressive 35 million user base. Users who play the in-app game have the option of converting their currency into NOT. The project has been promoted by none other than Telegram founder Pavel Durov, who heaped praise for Notcoin on his Telegram Channel. He noted, " We are now seeing a large wave of new mini-apps being built on Telegram and TON. Notcoin used its mighty paws to pave the way for many apps to come."Price Action: Barring the initial euphoria that saw the crypto gain 30% on its debut on May 16, the price action has disappointed investors. NOT was trading 62% down over the week, according to CoinMarketCap, with double-digit losses in the past 24 hours. Why It Matters: The price slump happened as most investors immediately resorted to profit-taking after receiving the airdrop rather than holding them for future gains.This happened despite the project introducing stalking services to restrict users from spending away their coins. The sharp fall since the hype created last week reflected the topsy-turvy world of cryptocurrencies, which, despite the considerable stability seen in some of its blue-chip assets, remains a very volatile industry. Read Next: Bitcoin Worth $1B Transferred By Just Paying $7.30 In Fees: Can Traditional Banking Carry Out Such A Feat?Image via ShutterstockMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Bitcoin's most recent reversal at $67,000, toward $65,880, was a worrying sign for investors as it would mean that the asset could not gain a foothold above the 50 EMA resistance level. Luckily, the situation has changed, and Bitcoin managed to paint a green candle in the last few hours. This could be a sign that BTC is gearing up for another push toward the long-anticipated $70,000 mark.Bitcoin has been consolidating between $65,000 and $67,000 in the last few days, trying to break above critical resistance levels. The 50 EMA has been the most important threshold for BTC to break, and the recent bullish momentum suggests that BTC might be able to overcome this barrier and leave it behind. A successful breach of the 50 EMA could set the stage for a rally toward $70,000.Bitcoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the on-chain data, we see a substantial number of large transactions, which indicates increased activity among whales. Over the last 24 hours, there have been 11.8K large transactions, hitting the seven-day high of 17.89K on May 15, 2024. This surge in large transactions is a positive sign, as it shows that big players are still actively trading Bitcoin, potentially driving the price higher.Furthermore, the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) data reveals that a significant number of addresses are "in the money" at the current price levels. Approximately 5.96 million addresses, or 71.14%, are profitable, which provides a solid foundation for bullish sentiment. These addresses could act as a support level if Bitcoin faces another downturn, as holders might be less likely to sell at a loss.The next major resistance levels are between $66,628 and $67,788. If Bitcoin can break through this zone, it will likely target the $70,000 mark. The data suggests that there is a strong chance of this happening, especially with the current bullish momentum and the increased activity among large traders.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Unstable at $67K, Altcoins Turn Red (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price dropped below $67,000 on a few occasions in the past 24 hours but has reacted well to each correction and now sits at that line once again.
The altcoins are slightly in the red on a daily scale, with TON, ADA, and SHIB retracing by around 3%.
BTC Goes Down and Up
It was less than a week ago – last Tuesday – when the primary cryptocurrency’s price had declined to just over $61,000 amid some Coinbase issues. However, the asset bounced off almost immediately and started a notable rally on Wednesday after the US CPI numbers were announced.
In a matter of hours, BTC jumped by several grand and exceeded $66,000. It corrected on Thursday to just under $65,000 but reversed its trajectory once again by the end of the week.
This culminated in a couple of price pumps above $67,500, the latest of which came on Sunday. However, the bears intercepted the move and pushed BTC down to just under $66,000. A bit more volatility followed with another brief decline, but bitcoin currently stands close to $67,000 once again, being down less than 0.5% in a day.

Alts See Red
Most altcoins have mimicked BTC’s performance in the past 24 hours, posting minor losses. ETH is close to breaking below $3,100 after a 0.4% daily decline as anticipation for the SEC’s decision on Ethereum ETFs grows. Binance Coin has decreased by a similar percentage to $576.
More losses from the larger-cap alts come from XRP, DOGE, AVA, DOT, TRX, and BCH, while TON, SHIB, and ADA are down by 2.5-3%.
In contrast, Solana’s native token has jumped by 2.5% and sits close to $180. WIF, PEPE, NEAR, and GRT are also slightly in the green.
The total crypto market cap has shed some value since yesterday and is just under $2.550 trillion on CG now.

US economist accuses government of causing inflation


As the United States grapples with inflation, renowned American economist Peter Schiff has accused the government, particularly the US Federal Reserve as one of its branches, of causing it, challenging the widely accepted viewpoint of rising salaries as the actual source of the price increases.
Specifically, Schiff has challenged the narrative of increased salaries causing inflation, arguing that, instead, inflation can lead to higher nominal salaries, whereas pointing the finger at, in his view, the real culprit – the US government and the Fed, according to his X post on May 20.


Indeed, Schiff has been warning about inflation for some time now, including last month, when he referred to this threat as “gravely understated” by those who are trying to curb inflation fears, stressing that the current situation was “just the tip of an inflation iceberg.



At the same time, the prominent economist declared that a full-blow inflationary depression or ‘stagflation’ was coming that would shadow previous financial crises and make them look tame by comparison, calling it a recession “on steroids,” as Finbold reported on April 30.

Moreover, recent data indicates that auto loan serious delinquency rates have surged to 2.8% in the first quarter of 2024, the highest level in nearly 15 years, or since 2010 – in the aftermath of the financial crisis, as US households continue to miss loan payments, reminiscent of past recessions.

Inflation concerns
Meanwhile, Paul Dietrich, a veteran Wall Street analyst who accurately predicted the 2008 recession, has long warned about a potential downturn, pointing at several red flags, including unexpectedly high inflation in the first quarter of 2024 and increased market volatility. As he said:

“The economy and the stock market have never seen anything like this in history. (…) Everything reminds me of the Dot-com bubble in 2001-2002. (…) Since the current deficit spending is unsustainable, it will end at some point. When it does, the effect will be brutal for jobs, the economy, and the global stock markets.”

Interestingly, Schiff, a well-known Bitcoin (BTC) skeptic, has earlier acknowledged that Bitcoin holders are “right about the Fed and inflation,” arguing that other investors were largely unaware of the current financial crisis and the “far greater currency and sovereign debt crisis it will ultimately become.”
In the meantime, Bitcoin and tech stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are among the market participants that have beaten inflation in the last 10 years.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin (BTC) halted its decline and regained traction, rising above $67,000 and reaching an intraday high of $67,600.After briefly dipping below $66,000, Bitcoin bounced back due to expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and increasing tensions in the Middle East, particularly following the helicopter crash involving Iran’s President.These factors have led investors to view Bitcoin as a hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainty.Looking ahead, crypto traders will focus on speeches by Fed officials Bostic, Bullard, Waller, Evans, and Mester, as these will provide insights into future monetary policy.Hawkish comments from these officials could limit Bitcoin’s upward trend by signalling tighter monetary policy, reducing the appeal of riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin as a Safe Haven Asset Amid Geopolitical Unrest
Bitcoin often gains value as a safe haven asset during periods of geopolitical turmoil or economic uncertainty. Recently, Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian tragically died in a helicopter crash in East Azerbaijan province. Rescuers found the crash site after searching in challenging weather conditions.
Iran’s vice president will assume presidential duties.
New elections are scheduled within 50 days.
Middle Eastern countries are showing solidarity with Iran during this difficult time.
The perception of Bitcoin as a safe haven asset can lead to increased demand and a higher BTC price amid such crises.Fed Rate Cut Expectations Boost Bitcoin Amid Economic Uncertainty
The broad-based US dollar edged lower as investors anticipated potential Fed rate cuts. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin noted that while inflation is easing, reaching the 2% target will take more time. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester stated that the current monetary policy is appropriate as they continue to assess economic data.Fed Governor Michelle Bowman mentioned that while the policy is restrictive, she is open to hiking rates if inflation stalls.
According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets have priced in a 10% chance of a rate cut in June and nearly 80% in September.The prospect of Fed rate cuts and cautious monetary policy comments contribute to increased uncertainty and volatility in financial markets. This environment leads investors to seek alternative assets like Bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against inflation and economic instability, boosting its price.











The BTC/USD is currently trading at $66,927, up 1.01% with a bullish Bitcoin price prediction. The 4-hour chart shows the pivot point at $65,984, a crucial level for near-term price action.
Immediate resistance is at $67,443, followed by $69,156 and $71,194. On the downside, immediate support lies at $64,617, with further support at $63,040 and $61,328.
Bitcoin Price Prediction
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 59, indicating moderate momentum. An ascending triangle pattern is forming, with resistance around $67,443 and support at $65,985, typically signalling a potential breakout to the upside.
The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $64,562 supports the bullish outlook.

Current Trend: Bitcoin remains bullish above $65,984. A break below this level could trigger a sharp selling trend.

Senate Passes Bipartisan Crypto Bill, Biden Faces Dilemma Over SEC Veto Threat



                    

On May 16, 2024, a majority of U.S. Senators approved a Congressional Review Act (CRA) to review the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). 



The Senate passed H.J.Res. 109 with a 60 to 38 vote, a rare bipartisan achievement. Notably, 51 of the votes came from Democrats. 




Senator Cynthia Lummis highlighted this as a historic moment, marking the first time Congress passed standalone crypto legislation.



President Biden had previously threatened to veto any resolution overturning the SEC policy. 



The White House stated its strong opposition to disrupting the SEC’s efforts to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and the broader financial system. 




Despite the threat, historical data shows that around one-third of threatened vetoes are never executed, making the outcome uncertain.



The bipartisan support for the crypto bill was emphasized by Perianne Boring, CEO of the Digital Chamber, who noted that the controversy around SAB 121 led 21 Democratic Senators to break ranks. 



Among the supportive Democrats was Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Boring suggested that Schumer’s support could prompt the White House to reconsider its stance, indicating a shift in Washington’s attitude towards crypto.

The Biden administration faces pressure from beyond the political sphere as well. 



The American Bankers Association has urged President Biden to sign H.J.Res. 109 to protect consumers, highlighting the banking sector’s interest in offering custody services for cryptocurrencies.



With broad support for H.J.Res. 109, the Biden administration must decide whether to veto the resolution, potentially causing internal conflict within the Democratic Party as elections approach. 



Patrick Kirby of the Crypto Council for Innovation explained that Biden has 10 days to sign, veto, or allow the resolution to become law without his signature. 



Alternatively, Biden could use a pocket veto if Congress is not in session.



Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance further complicates Biden’s decision, as Trump could leverage this position in the upcoming election. 



Kirby noted that if Biden vetoes H.J.Res. 109, Congress could attempt to override it with a two-thirds majority in both chambers.



A possible resolution could come from the SEC itself. Republican Wiley Nickel suggested that SEC Chair Gary Gensler could revoke SAB 121, removing the need for Biden’s veto. 



SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce criticized SAB 121 at a Blockchain Summit, saying it hampers industry growth by requiring companies to record crypto assets as both assets and liabilities, contrary to conventional asset custody practices.



Pierce welcomed Congress’s involvement in crypto regulation, viewing it as a positive development for consumers and financial innovation. 



As the SEC holds the power to resolve this issue, the next move is theirs.

                        The Hong Kong Institute for International Finance (HKIIF) Chairman Xiao Geng recently highlighted the potential benefits of a CNY-pegged stablecoin for Hong Kong during an event.According to a report by Xinhua Finance, Xiao delivered a speech at “The First Shenzhen Finance Forum and The Opening Ceremony of Shenzhen Finance Institute.” The event was hosted by Renmin University of China and had a session focused on digital finance.Hong Kong’s Special Status for Chinese Yuan
During the speech, Xiao emphasized that a stablecoin pegged to Chinese yuan could enhance the offshore CNY market and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center.Xiao said that Hong Kong plays a crucial role in the international promotion of the Chinese yuan, serving as the world’s largest offshore CNY business hub. He noted that the Greater Bay Area’s cross-border CNY products are particularly innovative.Xiao highlighted Hong Kong’s tradition as a testing ground for financial innovations, supported by a robust institutional and market foundation that allows for trials with minimal resistance.He also acknowledged the city’s capability to support and develop advanced digital financial infrastructures.Therefore, Xiao advocated for the creation of a Greater Bay Area stablecoin linked to the Chinese yuan. This stablecoin, based on regulated blockchains and digital smart contracts, elevate Hong Kong’s status in the global financial sector.Benefits of CNY-Pegged Stablecoin
He explained that such a stablecoin could solidify Hong Kong’s position by leveraging its role as an experimental zone for CNY internationalization and its novel boundary-less CNY products.In addition, this initiative could further integrate the financial systems of the Mainland Onshore and Hong Kong-Macau Offshore special economic zones.According to Xiao, the stablecoin could balance the USD-dominated international financial system while enriching the spectrum of offshore CNY market products.On the other hand, the stablecoin would construct “firewalls” and “spare tires” to guard against systemic risks that might arise from a potential collapse of the USD, where the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar.

Solana memecoin protocol pump.fun exploit mastermind arrested in London - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Jarett Dunn, aka @STACCoverflow, arrested in London for Solana memecoin exploit.
Dunn used flash loans to manipulate pump.fun, stealing $2 million in liquidity.
Released on bail, Dunn confessed online, citing mental health struggles and grief

The alleged orchestrator of the recent Solana memecoin protocol pump.fun exploit, Jarett Dunn, known online as @STACCoverflow, has been arrested in London.
The arrest follows a sophisticated 26-hour intelligence operation spearheaded by a third-party stakeholder who had enlisted a private intelligence firm to track Dunn’s activities.
Jarett Dunn arrested in Middle Eight Hotel
The operation culminated in the early hours of May 18 when local operatives, or “auxiliaries,” pinpointed Dunn’s location at the Middle Eight Hotel in Covent Garden.
After a seven-hour search, British authorities apprehended Dunn, who has since been released on bail pending his court appearance in August.
The Pump.fun flash loan exploit
Dunn, a former contractor, is accused of exploiting the Solana-based pump.fun protocol by utilizing flash loans from the Raydium lending platform.
Flash loans allow users to borrow large sums of capital without collateral, provided the loan is repaid within the same transaction.
Dunn allegedly manipulated the pump.fun bonding curves to access and withdraw substantial liquidity, profiting $2 million in the process.
In the aftermath of the exploit, Dunn took to social media to confess his involvement. His posts on X (formerly Twitter) revealed a mix of remorse and defiance, hinting at a desire to distribute the stolen funds to Solana (SOL) token holders.
Dunn also opened up about his mental health struggles and the recent loss of his mother, suggesting that emotional distress played a significant role in his actions.
The exploit has prompted pump.fun to work closely with law enforcement to investigate the breach. Initial theories by Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at cryptocurrency market maker Wintermute, pointed to an internal private key leak.
Dunn’s erratic tweets have since confirmed his role, though the specifics of his proposed fund distribution remain unclear.
As the investigation continues, the cryptocurrency community watches closely, awaiting further developments in this high-profile case.

BounceBit's 2024 Roadmap Highlights Post-Mainnet Strategy


On May 20, one week after its mainnet launch, BounceBit, a Bitcoin restaking protocol, unveiled its detailed 2024 roadmap.
The roadmap highlights the company’s plans to enhance the integration of centralized finance (CeFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi), forming a hybrid known as CeDeFi.
BounceBit Aims to Merge the Best of CeFi and DeFi

BounceBit’s 2024 roadmap outlines a series of upgrades and new product offerings. These plans are designed to strengthen its ecosystem and improve user experience. The roadmap intends to optimize its blockchain infrastructure, enhance liquidity, and provide diverse yield-generating options for investors.
The project sees key issues in both sectors. Centralized platforms offer structure and accessibility, but they often conflict with crypto’s core values of transparency and decentralization. Conversely, DeFi provides direct market participation but struggles with smart contract security and scalability challenges.
Read more: CeFi vs. DeFi: Everything You Need To Know
By integrating the best aspects of CeFi and DeFi, BounceBit aims to democratize access to high-yield opportunities traditionally reserved for top asset management firms. The BounceBit Chain, the project’s blockchain infrastructure, ensures secure and efficient settlement and record-keeping. Users can earn staking rewards and participate in yield-generating activities using a dual-token proof-of-stake system.
Liquid Custody Tokens (LCT) play a central role in BounceBit’s ecosystem, bridging CeFi and DeFi. These tokens enable users to earn interest from CeFi while participating in Bitcoin staking and on-chain farming.

“All LCTs are backed 1:1 by equivalent assets in custody, and they stay there until the LCT is redeemed. Custody is effectively an aggregated pool of assets, in a passive state, until they are not,” the BounceBit team wrote in its roadmap.

The integrated ecosystem offers three yield types: CeFi yield from arbitrage and lending, staking rewards, and opportunity yield from engaging in the BounceBit chain ecosystem.

Additionally, BounceBit Chain will see major upgrades to improve performance and usability. These include optimized EVM execution, a shared security client module, a new mempool module for higher transaction throughput, and refined communication between EVM and Cosmos software development kit (SDK).
BounceBit also introduces BounceClub. This club focuses on providing CeDeFi as a service, allowing users to launch their own products using BounceBit’s infrastructure.

According to BeInCrypto’s previous report, BounceBit launched its mainnet on May 13, along with an airdrop of its native token, BB, which several crypto exchanges listed. Despite a current market capitalization of $130.4 million, BB’s price has decreased from $0.46 at launch to $0.31, reflecting a 6.77% drop in the last 24 hours.

4 Key Reasons Why The Bitcoin Bull Run Is Far From Over


																In an analysis shared via X, renowned crypto analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) has provided compelling evidence to support his assertion that the current Bitcoin bull run is far from over. Ted’s insights are based on four critical indicators related to traditional finance and crypto liquidity, each pointing to sustained growth in the near future. Here’s a breakdown of his analysis:
#1 65-Month Liquidity Cycle
Ted highlights the 65-month liquidity cycle, a historical pattern that marks the ebb and flow of liquidity in financial markets. According to his analysis, this cycle bottomed out in October 2023, signaling the beginning of a new expansion phase.

“We are now in the expansion phase, which is expected to peak in 2026,” Ted stated. This projection aligns with the anticipated easing by central banks in response to slowing economic data over the next 18 to 24 months. Historically, increased liquidity has been a precursor to bull markets in various asset classes, including Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem.

#2 M2 Money Supply
The M2 money supply, which includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money, is another crucial indicator, if not the most important indicator of global liquidity. Ted notes that the rate of expansion in the M2 money supply is at its lowest since the 1990s.
“There is plenty of room to the upside for easing liquidity conditions,” he explained. As central banks potentially ease monetary policies to stimulate economies, increased M2 growth could lead to more capital flowing into risk assets like Bitcoin.

#3 Crypto Liquidity
While liquidity has returned to the crypto markets, particularly with the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ted points out that the velocity of inflows has not yet reached the levels seen at cycle tops. “The velocity of inflow has not yet seen a manic phase consistent with cycle tops,” he noted.

This suggests that while interest and investment in Bitcoin are growing, the market has not yet reached the speculative frenzy that typically precedes a major correction. This phase of measured inflow can provide a more stable foundation for continued price increases.

#4 Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows
The US based spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant inflows, with last week alone witnessing $950 million flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, the largest net inflow since March. Ted expects these inflows to increase as Bitcoin’s price rises and traditional finance investors regain confidence in the asset.
“Expect these to only increase as price drifts higher and tradFi once again renew faith in the asset,” he stated. The growing acceptance and investment from institutional investors via ETFs are a strong bullish indicator for Bitcoin’s continued ascent.

Each of these factors points to a sustained and robust bull market for Bitcoin. Ted’s analysis, grounded in traditional financial indicators and crypto-specific data, provides a comprehensive outlook on the current and future state of the Bitcoin market. As central banks potentially ease monetary policies and institutional interest continues to grow, the conditions appear ripe for Bitcoin’s bull run to extend well into the coming years.
At press time, BTC traded at $66,602.

WIX Beats Q1 Forecasts with $1.38 EPS and $419.8 Million Revenue - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Wix.com Ltd. (NASDAQ: WIX), a leading SaaS website builder platform, has reported a strong start to the fiscal year 2024, showcasing robust financial performance in the first quarter. The company achieved total revenue of $419.8 million, marking a 12% year-over-year increase. This was driven by a reacceleration in Creative Subscriptions growth, which saw revenue rise to $304.3 million, up 9% from the previous year.



The Business Solutions segment also showed impressive growth, with revenue reaching $115.5 million, a 20% increase year-over-year.



Total bookings for the quarter amounted to $457.3 million, reflecting a 10% year-over-year growth. The momentum in the Partners business was particularly noteworthy, driven by the strong uptake of Wix Studio. This segment alone contributed $138.4 million in revenue, up 33% year-over-year. The company also reported a GAAP operating income of $9.7 million, marking the second consecutive quarter of GAAP operating profit, and a free cash flow margin of 26%, setting a new record.



WIX Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



Wix’s first-quarter performance notably exceeded market expectations. Analysts had projected an earnings per share (EPS) of $1.03 and revenue of $417.9 million. However, Wix reported a non-GAAP net income of $77.3 million, translating to an EPS of $1.38 per basic share and $1.29 per diluted share, significantly surpassing the anticipated figures. The total revenue of $419.8 million also exceeded the expected $417.9 million, underscoring the company’s strong market position and operational efficiency.



The company’s robust performance was underpinned by higher conversion rates and improved monetization across its user base. This was further supported by the substantial traction of its AI product offerings and the continued success of Wix Studio. The high conversion rates of Studio users, resulting in more premium subscriptions than anticipated, highlight the effectiveness of Wix’s product strategy and its ability to meet market demands.





WIX Ups 2024 Full Year Guidance



Looking ahead, Wix has raised its full-year 2024 guidance based on the strong first-quarter performance and positive business trends. The company now expects full-year bookings to be in the range of $1,796 to $1,826 million, representing a 12-14% year-over-year growth. This revised outlook is approximately $13 million higher at the midpoint compared to previous estimates. The increase in bookings is anticipated to be driven by accelerating growth in both the Self Creators and Partners segments, with AI products and Wix Studio playing pivotal roles.



Wix also updated its revenue outlook for 2024, now expecting total revenue to be between $1,738 and $1,761 million, reflecting an 11-13% year-over-year growth. For the second quarter of 2024, the company projects total revenue to be in the range of $431 to $435 million, which translates to an 11-12% year-over-year growth. Additionally, Wix has maintained its non-GAAP total gross margin guidance at 68-69% for the full year and expects non-GAAP operating expenses to be 50-51% of revenue.

Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is on the verge of a significant breakout, according to prominent crypto analyst Jelle. In a recent tweet, Jelle highlighted a potentially bullish setup for Ethereum, noting that ETH was close to breaking out from a falling wedge.The analyst mentioned that after reclaiming the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), ETH only needed a little push to break out from the multi-month continuation pattern, with a target of over $4,000. The falling wedge pattern, a technical analysis tool, is typically seen as a bullish indicator, suggesting that a significant price movement could be imminent.Reclaiming the 100-day EMA is a crucial step for Ethereum, as it often acts as a support level, reinforcing the potential for an upward breakout. If ETH successfully breaks out of the falling wedge, it could target the $4,000 mark, a significant psychological and technical level for the cryptocurrency. This potential move could attract more investors, further driving up the price and trading volume.Bullish signals emerge for ETHAs of the latest data, Ethereum is trading at $3,101, experiencing a slight decline of 0.28% in the past 24 hours. Despite this minor drop, the ETH price has shown a positive trend over the past week, gaining 4.07%. This upward momentum is reflected in the increased trading activity, with the 24-hour trading volume surging by 35.51% to reach $11.17 billion.Moreover, technical indicators further support the bullish outlook for the Ethereum price. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.93, which is indicative of bullish sentiment on the market. Notably, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is at −26.25, signaling a buying opportunity for investors.In the end, this analysis reveals that Ethereum is poised for a notable price breakout, with technical indicators and trading volume supporting a bullish scenario. Investors and traders will be closely watching for a decisive move above the current levels, potentially pushing the ETH price toward the $4,000 target.

Dr Wright’s explanations are 'absurd' and 'plainly forged' Judge states in written judgment

The full written judgment in Dr. Craig Wright vs. COPA was released this morning, May 20, including damning indictments of Dr. Wright’s actions during the trial.“Dr Wright lied to the Court extensively and repeatedly. Most of his lies related to the documents he had forged which purported to support his claim. All his lies and forged documents were in support of his biggest lie: his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto”​The judge identified numerous instances where Dr. Wright forged documents to support his claim of being Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. According to the judgment, Dr. Wright’s narrative was riddled with inconsistencies and fabrications, severely undermining his credibility.The judgment highlighted that if Dr. Wright’s claims were valid, he would be an extraordinarily unfortunate individual beset by a series of implausible coincidences and conspiracies. However, the court determined that the simpler and more plausible explanation is that Dr. Wright has been dishonest for years, fabricating evidence to support his assertions.The judge pointed out that Dr. Wright’s extensive fabrications and forgeries were exposed during the trial.“These fabrications and forgeries were exposed in the evidence which I received during the Trial. For that reason, this Judgment contains considerable technical and other detail which is required to expose the true scale of his mendacious campaign to prove he was/is Satoshi Nakamoto”.​The detailed judgment outlines the technical and other forms of evidence that revealed the extent of his deceptive campaign to convince the court and the public of his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto.Ultimately, the court concluded that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that Dr. Wright was not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper or the person who adopted the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym between 2008 and 2011. The judgment further asserted that Dr. Wright did not create the Bitcoin system or the initial versions of the Bitcoin software.“I reached the conclusion the evidence was overwhelming… Dr Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper”.​The appendix to the main judgment included further, more specific condemnations of Dr. Wright’s actions. Listing each piece of evidence, Judge Mellor commented that “Dr Wright’s explanations are absurd. He plainly forged this email” and that ​​“I am in no doubt that all of Dr Wright’s LATEX documents are recent forgeries created by Dr Wright”.​​Further, Judge Mellor outright rejected claims that Dr. Wright had been hacked, instead stating,“I reject Dr Wright’s allegation of having been hacked. In my judgment, the evidence clearly demonstrates that the BDO Drive was seeded by Dr Wright with all the New Reliance Documents in September 2023 and that he was responsible for all the manipulations identified by Mr Madden”While the judgment document did not specify particular punishments or remunerations for Dr. Wright, it indicated that further relief, including potential injunctive measures sought by the plaintiffs, would be addressed in a subsequent hearing following the judgment’s handdown.Mentioned in this article

Trader turns $2.2K SOL into $2.26M in 8 hours with new memecoin

A savvy trader turned $2,275 worth of Solana (SOL) tokens into a profit of $2.26 million in just eight hours.The memecoin trader’s wallet, known as ‘sundayfunday.sol,’ made an over 993-fold gain on his 13 SOL investment into newly-launched memecoin 1DOL, according to a May 19 post by Lookonchain:“8 hours ago, He spent 13 $SOL ($2,275) to buy 242M #1DOL, which is currently worth $2.26M!”Memecoins like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Pepe (PEPE) have taken the spotlight since the Bitcoin halving. Despite having no underlying utility, memecoins often reach multibillion-dollar valuations, making millionaires for some investors.The over 900-fold gain is no coincidence as the wallet is also the largest pre-sale participant of the Book of Memes (BOME) token.

Genesis to return $3B to customers after court approves bankruptcy plan - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Genesis Global gets court approval to repay $3 billion to customers.
Judge Sean Lane overruled an objection from Genesis parent company Digital Currency Group.
DCG argued payments to be in US value of assets as of bankruptcy filing in January 2023.

Genesis Global has secured court approval to return $3 billion in cash and crypto to its creditors, details in a recent court filing show. The payouts will represent about 77% of customers’ claims.
However, the payout doesn’t include Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of Genesis Global.
The development comes after US Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane approved the Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan Genesis Global and its subsidiaries filed in January 2023. Genesis’ bankruptcy followed the collapse of Three Arrows Capital and FTX in 2022.
Judge overrules DCG objection
As noted above, the plan to return billions of dollars worth of crypto assets and cash to Genesis creditors has received a node from Judge Sean Lane. 
On Friday, the judge overruled DCG’s objection to the liquidation plan, paving way for this significant step in the right direction for creditors. 
In their argument, DCG had argued that Genesis should pay customers as per the value of their crypto assets at the time the company filed for bankruptcy.
In dismissing DCG’s objections, Judge Lane noted:
“The record here clearly establishes that there is not sufficient value in the Debtors’ estates to provide DCG a recovery as equity holder after unsecured creditors are paid… Given the size of the creditor claims, DCG is out of the money as an equity holder by billions of dollars, even if the Court valued creditor claims using the method DCG proposes.”
When Genesis filed for Chapter 11, customer claims by the top 50 creditors was over $3.5 billion. The court’s approval of the liquidation plan will see approximately 97% of reimbursements handled in-kind.
This means a customer who deposited BTC will receive payout in BTC and not the equivalent US dollar value.
Genesis to return crypto to customers beginning next month
At current prices, customer claims for Bitcoin or Ethereum are trading at 97-110% for claims amounting to over $10 million. Claims under $1 million are trading at 74-94%. In comparison, the claims traded at 35% at the time the crypto lender filed for bankruptcy.
For stablecoins, its 89-91% for claims of $1-10 million and 73-88% for accounts with under $1 million.
The plan allows for creditors reimbursements to begin early next month, bringing value to Gemini Earn customers and other Genesis creditors. 
Notably, the price of Bitcoin has increased significantly since January 2023, rising from around $21k to currently hover above $66k. BTC reached a new all-time high above $73k in March.

How to buy Bitcoin in Switzerland

Switzerland has emerged as a digital innovation hub due to progressive regulations and a welcoming atmosphere for crypto enterprises. At the core of this innovation lies Zug, dubbed the Crypto Valley, which houses hundreds of firms spearheading fintech and blockchain development. The country’s robust regulatory framework ensures security and privacy for stakeholders involved, earning it a prominent position in the landscape of crypto innovation.The Henley & Partners Crypto Adoption Index report 2023 places Switzerland second, with an impressive score of 46.9%. Switzerland performed well in innovation and technology, regulatory environment and economic factors.This article delves into the process of purchasing Bitcoin (BTC) in Switzerland and explains if Bitcoin is legal in Switzerland, Swiss banks’ attitudes toward cryptocurrency, and how to buy Bitcoin via crypto exchanges, Bitcoin ATMs, P2P platforms and Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) machines.Is Bitcoin legal in Switzerland?Switzerland follows a forward-looking approach when it comes to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Swiss regulators acknowledge Bitcoin as a legal asset or property, with exchanges and digital currency platforms allowed to function within Swiss borders once they obtain the required permissions.Gains made via Bitcoin are liable for income tax for corporations and professional traders or wealth tax for individuals. A robust blockchain ecosystem has been cultivated in Switzerland thanks to the country’s crypto-friendly regulations, especially in the canton of Zug, which is known as Crypto Valley because of the concentration of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related enterprises there. Switzerland has enacted laws governing virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to ensure security and transparency in the crypto industry. VASPs need to comply with the Financial Services Act (FinSA) and the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Act to operate in Switzerland. They need to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) processes and conduct extensive customer due diligence. These organizations must also register with the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and follow stringent reporting guidelines.Regulations in Switzerland consider a VASP to be operating professionally if it:Generates a gross revenue exceeding 50,000 Swiss francs per calendar year.Establishes business relationships with more than 20 contractual parties within a calendar year.Exercises unrestricted control over third-party funds totaling more than 5 million francs.Executes transactions with a total volume surpassing 2 million francs annually.How Switzerland’s banking sector is embracing cryptocurrencies and blockchain Let’s take a look at the kind of crypto products rolled out by Swiss banks and how they have been embracing blockchain technology:Types of cryptocurrency products and services offered by banks in SwitzerlandSwiss banks offer various types of cryptocurrency products and services:Trading and brokerage: Certain banks enable their clients to buy and sell cryptocurrencies through partnerships with specialized platforms.Integration of wealth management: Some banks use cryptocurrency in investment portfolios for specific clientele. Custodial services: To attract institutional investors and alleviate security concerns, several banks hold cryptocurrency assets on behalf of their clients. Crypto-related products: A few banks are leading the way in innovation by developing investment funds or structured products based on cryptocurrency performance. Swiss banks dabbling with blockchain technologyMany banks in Switzerland are embracing blockchain technology to enhance their operations. For instance, Cantonal Bank incorporates blockchain to diversify revenue streams and attract younger, tech-savvy customers. Falcon Private Bank, Julius Bär, and Vontobel banks cooperate with cryptocurrency experts to provide trading and asset storage services. Maerki Baumann Bank provides corporate banking accounts to companies, particularly those raising funds through security token offerings (STOs). Santander Private Banking International has also announced plans to provide cryptocurrency trading and custody services to its high-net-worth clients in Switzerland. All these services will be offered following Switzerland’s advanced crypto legislation.How to buy Bitcoin in SwitzerlandUsers have several options when it comes to buying Bitcoin in Switzerland:Cryptocurrency exchanges Switzerland, known for its robust financial regulatory ecosystem, hosts both global and local crypto exchanges. International exchanges such as Binance, Crypto.com and Kraken enable residents to trade various cryptocurrencies. Native exchanges like Bitcoin Suisse also cater to institutional investors and individual traders. Here is a step-by-step process of how to use a cryptocurrency exchange to buy Bitcoin in Switzerland.Choose a crypto exchangeUsers should do their research and pick a secure cryptocurrency exchange with a track record to prove its credentials. Users should conduct thorough research, read user reviews and consider their trading needs before selecting a platform. Set up an accountOnce the user has chosen an exchange, they must create an account. Swiss regulations require the exchanges to ensure all users have completed identity verification processes, including KYC.Fund your accountAt this stage, users need to fund their exchange account with Swiss francs or any other recognized fiat currencies. Users may use bank transfers, credit/debit cards or other payment options.Place an orderThe user can state how much Bitcoin they wish to acquire. When choosing spot trading, they could place a market or a limit order. A limit order runs only when the price hits a predetermined threshold. A market order executes immediately at the current market price.VerificationBefore confirming the transaction, one should double-check the details of their order, including the price and quantity. After verification, the exchange will process their order and credit their exchange account with the cryptocurrency ordered.Store crypto After buying Bitcoin, one might keep it on the exchange or, for added security, transfer it to a private cryptocurrency wallet. Bitcoin ATMBitcoin ATMs, or BTMs, let customers buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using cash.Similar to conventional ATMs, users can deposit cash, choose their preferred cryptocurrency, and receive coins of the equivalent value in their chosen wallet. Users can also deposit cryptocurrencies and withdraw cash after completing verification.According to Coin ATM Radar, over 130 ATMs are present across Switzerland as of May 2024. Basel, Bern, Genève, Ipsach, Lausanne, Biel/Bienne, Chur and Lugano are home to most of the ATMs, with Zurich being home to almost 40 Bitcoin ATMs.Peer-to-peer platformsThe peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange refers to buying or selling Bitcoin directly with another person on a platform: Choose and register on a P2P platformOpt for a credible platform that facilitates P2P trading. Platforms such as Paxful and Remitano offer escrow services to guarantee security.On the P2P platform, create an account. Share the required details and finish any identity verification processes the platform requests.Find sellersUsers need to look through the platform’s list of sellers and select one that fits their requirements. Take into account aspects such as transaction restrictions and seller credibility.Open a tradeOne can open a trade with the chosen seller by mentioning the quantity of Bitcoin they wish to purchase and their preferred method of payment. Online wallets, PayPal, bank transfers and cash deposits are a few popular ways to make payments.Discuss termsSpeak to the seller and negotiate the conditions of the trade, including the exchange rate and payment instructions. Users should address any queries or worries they may have before completing the purchase.Finalize the transactionPay the seller via bank transfer or debit/credit card. The money will go to the escrow account. Users need to ensure that Bitcoin has arrived in the wallet before sending confirmation to the exchange.Swiss Federal Railways machinesIn 2016, the SBB introduced a new medium for buying Bitcoin straight from ticket vending machines. With over 1,000 machines spread around 700 rail stations, this program provides access to cash-based Bitcoin transactions.To buy Bitcoin from the railway ticket machines, a user must have a Bitcoin wallet and a Swiss mobile phone number. Anyone can access crypto-enabled SBB machines to buy Bitcoin 24/7. Buyers can also purchase and keep Bitcoin offline using a paper wallet.Though convenient, SBB’s Bitcoin service imposes exorbitant fees, ranging from 6% to 14%, making Bitcoin purchases expensive.How and where to spend Bitcoin in SwitzerlandSpending cryptocurrency is becoming more and more feasible in Switzerland as the adoption is steadily increasing. In Zurich and Geneva, lots of restaurants, shops and luxury boutiques take payments in crypto. Lugano, the largest city in the Italian-speaking region of southern Switzerland, has de-facto adopted BTC as legal tender. Renowned brands such as McDonalds, Rolex and Lamborghini and regular businesses like pharmacies, convenience stores and tobacco shops in the city accept BTC as payment.Across the country, a large number of online merchants and service providers give customers BTC and other crypto payment choices, with no shortage of services facilitating the conversion between fiat and crypto.The country hosts many Bitcoin ATMs, simplifying the process of exchanging Bitcoin for Swiss francs and vice versa. Switzerland’s positive approach toward digital currencies has provided holders with a range of choices regarding how to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.How to store Bitcoin in SwitzerlandStoring crypto assets is important due to risks such as thefts, hacking, scams and cyberattacks. Leaving assets on exchanges could expose them to hacking risks. Though spreading assets across multiple exchanges reduces risk, reliance on centralized exchanges might result in potential hazards. Hot wallets that are connected to the internet are always susceptible to hackers.For heightened security, crypto can be kept offline in cold wallets. Physical devices like USB drives or paper wallets that are disconnected from the internet are termed cold wallets. This isolation gives them better protection against online threats and makes them a preferred choice for long-term storage of cryptocurrency assets.

Bryan Pellegrino, CEO of LayerZero, attracted attention with his diverse investment portfolio, which includes many promising projects in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.
LayerZero CEO Bryan Pellegrino's Investment Portfolio Attracts Interest
Its investments cover a range of innovative projects including Monad, SkyArk Chronicles, Pudgy Penguins, Shogun, Superform, Blockus, Crypto Rogue Games, Integral and Fantasy Top.


The revelation of Pellegrino's investment interests created curiosity and controversy within the crypto community, particularly regarding LayerZero's anti-Sybil plans.
Sybil attacks, where a single entity creates multiple identities to manipulate a network or gain unfair influence, are a significant concern in decentralized ecosystems.

Greenlight for Ethereum ETFs? SEC Examines Exchange Proposals


							

SEC reviews Ethereum ETF applications from stock exchanges.



Potential benefits for investors and wider adoption.



Final decision on approval remains uncertain.




The SEC is currently reviewing applications from stock exchanges seeking to list ETFs that directly hold Ethereum (Ether is Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency). If approved, these ETFs would trade on major exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq.







These applications, known as Rule 19b-4 filings, are the mechanism through which exchanges propose new products or rules to the SEC. In this instance, exchanges are requesting the go-ahead to list Ethereum ETFs on their platforms.



The approval process is not a simple one. There’s an additional hurdle: the S-1 filing. This is essentially a detailed prospectus outlining an ETF’s operations, finances, and management structure, required for any new security offered to the public. Both the 19b-4 and S-1 filings must be approved by the SEC before the ETFs can be traded.



The SEC has a designated timeframe (45 days, with a potential extension to 240 days) to make an initial decision on the 19b-4 filings. Exchange listing hinges on this approval. However, even with exchange approval, the S-1 filings could face delays.









The SEC’s cautious approach might be due to the complexities and potential risks associated with cryptocurrency products. Additionally, a lack of communication between issuers and the SEC suggests the regulator may be conducting a more thorough review.



Potential Benefits of Ethereum ETFs



If approved, Ethereum ETFs would make investing in Ethereum more accessible and secure for everyday investors. This could also lead to wider adoption of Ethereum and further integrate cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial landscape. However, the SEC’s final decision remains uncertain.

Weekly Crypto Preview: The Hottest Coins For The Next Days


								This week in the crypto market is marked by critical events and strategic developments that promise to influence trends and investor sentiment significantly. Here is an in-depth analysis of the most anticipated cryptocurrencies and their upcoming milestones.
#1 US Spot Ethereum ETF Deadline Looms
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) faces pivotal deadlines on May 23 and May 24 regarding the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs proposed by VanEck and ArkInvest/21Shares, respectively.
The likelihood of approval this month has significantly declined. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described the odds as “slim to none,” pointing to the SEC’s silence as a major indicator. However, last week, Coinbase released a new report, asserting that the approval of a US spot Ethereum ETF is a matter of “when, not if.”
They argue that the rationale used to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs — namely, the high correlation between CME futures and spot exchange rates — should also apply to Ethereum. Thus, they estimate the chances to be much higher, around 30-40%.

The SEC’s decisions on these applications will be crucial, potentially opening doors for broader institutional adoption and new investment products tied to Ethereum.
#2 AI Crypto Coins
This week, two significant events could influence the trajectory of AI related crypto projects. Firstly, NVIDIA’s Q1 2024 earnings report, scheduled for release on May 22, is highly anticipated. NVIDIA’s performance and outlook can significantly impact AI-related crypto projects. Strong earnings and positive guidance could bolster investor confidence in AI-driven crypto projects.
Secondly, on May 24, the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASI) will officially launch, marking the merger of Fetch.AI (FET), SingularityNET (AGIX), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN). This merger aims to create the highest-valued decentralized AI crypto project. The consolidation into a unified ASI token is designed to streamline operations, incentivize collaboration, and foster a stronger, more cohesive community.
The ASI token will bundle the resources and technological capabilities of FET, AGIX, and OCEAN, aiming to establish a dominant position in the decentralized AI market. The performance of the ASI token post-launch will be critical, as it will reflect the market’s reception to this ambitious merger.
#3 Fantom Rebrand
Fantom (FTM) is undergoing a transformative rebranding initiative, with a proposal to launch a new token, S. This rebranding effort involves renaming the Fantom network to Sonic and migrating FTM tokens to the new S tokens on a 1:1 basis.
The rebranding includes the launch of the Sonic Network, a new layer-1 blockchain with a native layer-2 bridge to Ethereum. This new network aims to leverage advanced technology to significantly enhance performance compared to the existing Opera network. Fantom Foundation has earmarked hundreds of millions of FTM from its treasury to support ecosystem development for Sonic, including marketing, business development, migration grants, and other adoption initiatives.

Fantom Operations Ltd will continue to support the Opera network, while Sonic Operations Ltd will focus on the Sonic Network. This dual-support system ensures continuity for current users while promoting migration to the new, more efficient Sonic Network.
Users will initially be able to swap their FTM tokens for S tokens at a 1:1 ratio, with the migration process anticipated to be bi-directional initially, allowing for flexibility. Over time, this is expected to transition to a one-way migration.
#4 Solana V1.18
Solana is preparing for a significant update. Scheduled for release on May 27, Solana’s mainnet v1.18 upgrade aims to address the network’s congestion issues, which have been triggered by spam transactions and the surge in memecoin activities.
This update is crucial as it aims to enhance the network’s efficiency and scalability. The congestion earlier this year, primarily caused by bots prioritizing their transactions and a dramatic increase in transactions associated with newly released meme coins, created an extraordinary demand for block space, impeding access for many users.
The Solana community is eagerly anticipating this update. A successful implementation could significantly improve the user experience, mitigate congestion issues, and restore confidence in Solana’s ability to handle high transaction volumes.
This could attract more users and developers to the platform, further strengthening SOL’s price, which rallied 22% over the past seven days.

#5 FLOKI Announcement
FLOKI, a meme coin inspired by Elon Musk’s pet Shiba Inu, has generated considerable buzz with a cryptic announcement. On May 4, FLOKI’s official Twitter account teased a major announcement for May 27, stating, “[…] And with FLOKI set to make a major announcement later this month, the excitement is far from over!”
While details remain undisclosed, the anticipation is poised to spark speculation and increased trading activity. Speculative announcements like this often lead to heightened price volatility and trading volumes. Traders and investors will be keen to see if the announcement delivers on the hype and positively impacts FLOKI’s price.

Vitalik Buterin is concerned about the decentralization of Ethereum

In a recent blog post, Vitalik Buterin expressed his opinions on three key issues regarding the decentralization of Ethereum: MEV, liquid staking, and node hardware requirements. 
Buterin explained that many of the concerns related to the centralization of Ethereum can be addressed through smart protocol designs and updates, some of which are already being implemented.
Let’s see below all the details. 

Decentralization of Ethereum: Vitalik Buterin’s response
As anticipated, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, responded to the criticisms directed at the blockchain in a detailed blog post, analyzing three fundamental issues for the centralization of Ethereum.
MEV (Miner Extractable Value), liquid staking and hardware costs for managing a single node are the three key points.
Buterin has observed that concerns about the design of Ethereum in these three key areas are “widely shared” and added:
“These are concerns I have personally had on many occasions.”
However, according to Buterin, these problems might not be as difficult to overcome as some argue.
In his post, published on May 17th, Buterin first addresses the issue of MEV, which is the financial gain that sophisticated node operators can obtain by reordering transactions within a block.
Buterin distinguishes two approaches to MEV: “minimization” (reducing MEV through the design of intelligent protocols, like CowSwap) and “quarantine” (attempting to reduce or eliminate MEV altogether through in-protocol techniques).
Although the MEV quarantine may seem like an appealing option, Buterin notes that this perspective carries some risks of centralization: 
“If builders have the power to completely exclude transactions from a block, attacks can easily arise-” 
However, Buterin has supported builders working on MEV quarantine through concepts like transaction inclusion lists, which “take away the builder’s ability to completely exclude transactions from a block.” 
“I think that the ideas in this direction – really pushing the quarantine box to be as small as possible – are really interesting, and I am in favor of going in that direction.” 
Buterin: reducing barriers for solo stakers, a crucial step
Vitalik Buterin has addressed the issue of the low number of solo stakers on Ethereum. 
In particular explaining that many prefer to use centralized staking providers like Coinbase or decentralized solutions like Lido and RocketPool. 
This choice is due to the complexity, hardware requirements, and the minimum of 32 ETH needed to run an Ethereum node independently.
While acknowledging the progress made in reducing the costs and complexity of managing a single node, Buterin emphasized that “there is still more that we could do.”
Suggesting the possibility of reducing the time required to withdraw ETH in staking or lowering the minimum requirement of 32 ETH to become a solo staker, as stated: 
“Incorrect answers could lead Ethereum down a path of centralization and ‘recreation of the traditional financial system with additional steps’; correct answers could create a shining example of a successful ecosystem with a wide and diversified set of individual stakers and highly decentralized staking pools.”
High hardware requirements for nodes: the civil debate
Regarding the high hardware requirements for nodes, Buterin admitted that the issue is more complex. 
However, he acknowledged that with the implementation of Verkle Trees and the upcoming EIP-4444, “the hardware requirements of a node could plausibly eventually decrease to less than one hundred gigabytes, and perhaps almost to zero if we completely eliminate the responsibility of storing the history (perhaps only for non-staking nodes).” 
Buterin concluded his post urging the Ethereum ecosystem to confront difficult questions rather than avoid them: 
“… We should have a deep respect for the properties that make Ethereum unique and continue to work to maintain and improve those properties as Ethereum grows.”
In a post on X, Buterin added that he is happy to see a civil debate among community members: 
“I am really proud of the fact that Ethereum does not have a culture that tries to prevent people from expressing their opinions, even when they have very negative feelings towards important things in the protocol or ecosystem. Some wave the ideal of ‘open discourse’ as a flag, others take it seriously.”

Top Analyst Flips Bearish on Pepe (PEPE), Warns Popular Memecoins Will Witness Over 80% Correction - The Daily Hodl


								An analyst who rode the 2023 crypto breakout thinks that memecoin Pepe (PEPE) is headed to much lower levels.
Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 553,800 followers on the social media platform X that PEPE appears to have made a false breakout to new all-time highs before sellers pushed the price below its range high of $0.000009959.










In technical analysis, a false breakout is often seen as a bearish sign, suggesting that sellers are overwhelming demand.
Says DonAlt,
“Fell below the previous highs. For now, that looks like a false breakout. As long as that’s not reclaimed, that’s a bearish chart. If reclaimed, that’d be quite bullish but only then.” 
Source: DonAlt/X
Based on the trader’s chart, the next support level for PEPE appears to be at $0.0000065. At time of writing, PEPE is worth $0.0000090.
As for fellow memecoin dogwifhat (WIF), DonAlt says the altcoin is bearish unless it recovers a key price level.
“Almost back to range low. Looks very bad still. Would look better above $2.77 or below $2.” 
Source: DonAlt/X
At time of writing, WIF is trading at $2.68.
Looking at the broader memecoin market, DonAlt believes that coins in the altcoin sector will witness massive devaluations based on data from previous cycles.
“If I’m right, the popular memes we trade today will trade 80%+ lower. Then you’ll have new memes come up that build new communities that run up. And we’ll have the same discussions in a couple of years…
Why am I saying that? Because we’ve gone through this exact scenario a hundred times in crypto history already. If the meme top isn’t in, it will be eventually. And then you’ll get a 90% nuke on all of them, even the most ‘blue chip’ memes (lol) that exist. It repeats every cycle.”

Do users really care about decentralization? Industry figures clash

Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist, known for his contributions to the concept of Danksharding, sparked a heated debate on the social platform X on May 19 by stating that Ethereum “actually realizes the crypto vision.”“Yes, it looks messy, but that’s because Ethereum is building for the real world. But it’s solving ALL the necessary problems and not a tiny subset.”Feist’s post prompted a response from Mert Mumtaz, the CEO of Solana developer platform Helius Labs. Mert argued that the crypto market understands the “necessary problems” more comprehensively than a single entity can.Source: MertMert suggested that market participants who value decentralization and censorship resistance would gravitate naturally toward Ethereum “if they think it realizes such a vision the best.” However, Feist expressed skepticism regarding the extent to which market participants actually value decentralization."The market cannot tell you whether you are realizing the crypto vision as far as decentralization and censorship resistance are concerned. For example, banks today obviously have good PMF without being decentralized in any way."Related: Ethereum dev’s paid EigenLayer role sparks debate on ‘conflicted incentives’Mert countered by explaining that the market dynamics are not homogenous and, as such, “you can’t know if they’re the correct” set of problems being solved. Feist then reinforced his belief that the market does not “value decentralization that highly,” concluding that he would “never let the market be the ultimate judge.” This concluding statement sparked Mert’s final response and the last word between the two:Source: MertThe discussion follows the controversy surrounding Ethereum Foundation’s Justin Drake taking on a paid adviser role at EigenFoundation. Already a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, Drake’s new adviser role “comes with a significant EIGEN token incentive,” suggesting a risk of “conflicted incentives,” according to one commentator.Magazine: Trader turns $3K into $46M in PEPE, Ethereum gas overhaul, Tornado dev guilty: Hodler’s Digest, May 12-18

Alliance BRICS: China surpasses the US dollar and puts pressure on the West

The BRICS countries, in particular Russia, China, and India, are trading goods in Rubles, Yuan, and Rupees bypassing the US dollar as the preferred currency: the latest significant trade involves Russia’s purchase of weapons worth $4 billion, paid to India in local currency.
The United States’ global sovereignty over trade is now numbered.All the details below.

Russia buys weapons from India paying $4 billion in local currencies: BRICS opposes the US dollar, including China
According to reports from local Eastern media, later confirmed by Watcher.Guru, the Russia-India axis of the BRICS alliance is trading a large amount of military armaments in local currencies, bypassing the US dollar from its role as the preferred currency for international trade.
More specifically, Russia is buying weapons produced by its Indian ally for a value of $4 billion in Rupees.
Mosca has stated that this is a move to support the defense of the country from Ukrainian settlements, and that it will continue to trade with New Delhi also various machinery, car parts and engineering goods.
By doing so, the BRICS confirms its stability and internal autonomy, accelerating the de-dollarization process started since last year.

India today joins the privileged club of arms suppliers of Russia along with Iran and North Korea, further strengthening the “special and privileged strategic partnership” between the two nations.
It is clear how the Soviets want to take advantage of India’s rapidly growing economy and increasingly diversify its Asian partners away from China, being able to definitively abandon dependence on the US dollar:
Both India and Russia have already seen a 25-fold increase in trade to over 50 billion dollars/year since the start of the special military operation in Ukraine, with aggressive plans to reach over 100 billion dollars/year in the next 5 years.
Even de-dollarization efforts are accelerating with trade, not only military but also related to the food, energy, and industrial supply chain) conducted in local currencies according to the rupee-ruble friendship agreement.
The latest $4 billion arms trade is just the tip of the iceberg of a recently strengthened collaboration, which has also seen Russia involved in investing in Indian government treasury bonds.
One year ago, as reported by Prof. Michele Geraci, trade between Russia and India had encountered some difficulties due to the second’s inability to export enough goods to allow an accumulation of Rupees at the Russian Central Bank.
Today things, especially considering the need for an arms race, seem to have definitely changed.

 The next decade will be challenging for the US dollar as many other developing nations are following the BRICS model, following the de-dollarization agenda.
China and Russia join forces in the de-dollarization process: 90% of trades in Rubles or Yuan
The de-dollarization process involves not only the two countries mentioned above but also and above all China, the main technological rival of the United States since 2010, which with its Yuan is trying to put sticks in the wheels of the US dollar.
Recently, Russian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese president Xi Jinping met to discuss the relations between the two BRICS nations and how to promote the mission of the alliance. Both leaders had agreed to enhance global partnership and strategic operation of their respective economies.
The meeting highlighted the intention to strengthen the commercial relationship between China and Russia, announcing that 90% of the exchanges will be conducted in Rubles or Yuan.

The final step of the diplomatic relationship between the two world superpowers strengthens the solidity of the BRICS alliance and pushes other nations to join the group and abandon their dependence on the US dollar.
In August 2023 Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates joined the alliance, expanding a reality born in 2009 from the union of India, China, Russia and Brazil.
China in particular has always been at the forefront in trying to hinder the advancement and dominance of the US dollar.
The latest move involving the Chinese yuan and the Russian ruble is a huge step towards de-dollarization and the promotion of local currency.
It is worth noting how the BRICS is also working on a common currency to be used within the bloc to support internal trade, in addition to the local currencies already in use.

Bitcoin Price Steady, But Network Activity Dwindles


							

New Bitcoin wallets plunge to 6-year low, signaling caution



Miner revenue tumbles as network activity slumps



Bitcoin price holds steady despite declining network activity




New data reveals a sharp decline in the creation of new Bitcoin wallets on the network. The daily average number of new addresses added has reached a six-year low, with only 275,000 created over the past week. This marks a steep drop from the 2018 high of 625,000.



In 2018, anticipation surrounding Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), the halving event, and major ecosystem developments like Ordinals fueled a surge in new wallet creation. That year, the network even surpassed its December 2017 peak in new addresses.



The past month has seen only around 6 million new wallet addresses added – a far cry from the trend over the past year, where every month except May exceeded 10 million.



Echoing this slowdown, miner revenue on the Bitcoin network has also plummeted to historic lows. The average daily miner revenue currently sits below $30 million, compared to an average exceeding a staggering $60 million in previous months. The monthly average miner revenue mirrored this trend, dropping from a peak of $2 billion in March 2024 to below $1 billion in May.









Despite trading well below its all-time high of $73,000, Bitcoin remains afloat. As of press time, it sits at $67,131, with a slight decline of 0.2% in the last day. However, the cryptocurrency has shown some resilience with modest gains of 10% and 4% over the past week and month, respectively. Notably, a significant surge of 36% in trading volume suggests continued investor interest, despite the slowdown in network activity.

BounceBit Roasts Runes and BRC-20 Tokens in Ambitious Roadmap - DailyCoin


        

BounceBit has announced its 2024 roadmap.



The roadmap outlined various ambitious initiatives the project aims to implement this year.



Notably, BounceBit ruled out some emerging trends from its plan.




Binance-backed Bitcoin restaking startup BounceBit announced an ambitious roadmap on Monday, outlining various initiatives it plans to implement this year.



The project explicitly noted that it does not aim to “act as a sidechain to the Bitcoin Network” or jump on “temporary hype” trends like runes and BRC-20 tokens. Instead, BounceBit plans to take an asset-driven approach, primarily focused on the BTC ecosystem.



No Plans for Bitcoin Layer 2



According to a May 20 blog post, BounceBit’s roadmap aims to bring a “fresh perspective” into the industry by integrating the best aspects of centralized finance (CeFi) and the innovative potential of decentralized finance (DeFi).




In the plan, the project has sidelined the possibility of building a Layer 2 chain on the BTC network, noting that such solutions have “no substantial demand” and that emerging trends like Runes and BRC-20 tokens often fail to address long-term needs.



“Our goal is to build infrastructure for Bitcoin as an asset, enhancing its utility without altering its core technology.” BounceBit said. “You might not agree, the market might not agree, and that’s fine, we are venturing this road anyway.”



Instead of developing another network, the project will implement several upgrades to its proof-of-stake layer-1 chain.



BounceBit Chain Upgrades



The project intends to optimize the EVM execution layer of its BounceBit Chain to improve node performance and build a new Mempool module to achieve higher transaction throughput.




Per the blog post, other updates to the network will include refactoring the communication layer between EVM and Cosmos SDK and developing a shared security client (SSC) module to allow other projects to utilize the liquidity of BounceBit BTC restaking chain.



While the roadmap doesn’t mention specific implementation dates, the project also plans to bring “CeDeFi” to BounceBit Portal, giving users access to more asset management venues and an expanded list of products “to cover most use cases.”

Pink Drainer Shuts Down: How Will Fund Withdrawal Affect DeFi? | Cryptopolitan

Pink Drainer, the drainer-as-a-service hacker group, announced it’s shutting down and deleting all data. Over its lifetime, Pink Drainer targeted communities and specific whale wallets. Estimates put the stolen funds between $75M and $85M, depending on the exact pricing approach. The Pink Drainer is a group dedicated to scamming wallet owners, usually through three main points of attack. One is through hacking or spamming high-profile social media accounts, including those of Vitalik Buterin, Crypto Bitboy, and major projects. The other is through Discord and other chats. Some used the drainer-as-a-service on fake sites, urging the user to connect a wallet. More than 21K users lost valuable NFT and fungible tokensFor over a year, Pink Drainer performed heists ranging from prominent to large-scale. The wallet drainer works on Ethereum, Avalanche, BSC, Polygon, Optimism, Gnosis, and Callisto Network, among others. More than 21K users lost valuable NFT and fungible tokens. Source: Dune AnalyticsThe earnings of Pink Drainer come not only from the heists, but from selling the drainer-as-a-service, with 5 ETH for lifetime access. This means that the hacks of Pink Drainer are not organized but are haphazard and depend on random outreach. The users of Pink Drainer’s service are also not shy about their on-chain behavior. Some of the wallets even send funds to Binance for swapping. Most users are semi-anonymous, and still use their social media personas. How Will Pink Drainer Affect Decentralized Finance?One effect of Pink Drainer is that its users may park some of the funds into DeFi protocols. Drainer users also often rely on Uniswap to convert the stolen funds. Pink Drainer is still the top 21 owner of SavingsDAI (sDAI), a token belonging to Spark Protocol. So far, the drainer wallet holds onto the funds, even days after announcing the end of exploits. Spark Protocol is a crypto lending aggregator, currently holding $2.36B in total value locked (TVL). The funds held by Pink Drainer will hardly affect the protocol, which is also supported by other large wallets and exchanges. Pink Drainer Turns Ethical HackerUsers affected by Pink Drainer may be able to receive some respite. The official X handle made a special offer to restitute some funds, with a time limit in the past eight months. Some funds, however, may already be beyond reach. About two weeks ago, Pink Drainer started moving its finds. Some of the stolen ETH is just parked in idle addresses. Other transactions have reached 1 Inch Network Aggregator, and Railgun WETH Helper, a service for private and anonymous DeFi. Railgun is still a relatively small service, reporting $68M in total value locked. What is curious is that its TVL has grown significantly since Pink Drainer started to unload some of the funds. Also read: Compound Finance suffers a breach of its X accountWhen it comes to NFT, returning them is even more difficult. Bored Ape 7531, for instance, is already part of someone else’s collection after one of the last big attacks of Pink Drainer.Drainer Threat is Not GoneThe threat of having a wallet drained is not gone. Pink Drainer itself warned of copycats or new links to connect wallets. Additional drainers are still offered to anyone and deployed via social media scams. The common thread is that all the scams offer valuable giveaways while requiring users to connect their wallets. Also read: Cybercriminal group “Pink Drainer” strikes again: $4.4 million theft in ChainlinkMost big projects’ social media have also warned that they will not contact users directly. However, data reveals that Inferno Drainer is still active and even more dangerous than Pink Drainer, with more than $166M in stolen funds.Inferno Drainer also claimed it would shut down in December 2023, after setting out a story about reaching its goal. Pink Drainer seems to mimic that approach, and it is uncertain if the threat is gone for good, or will return in another iteration. Inferno Drainer also worked by impersonating big crypto brands and spreading a long list of domains promising airdrops or NFT.Cryptopolitan reporting by Hristina Beeva

U.S. Bitcoin ETFs ‘pulling money off-chain’ into TradFi: Analyst - AMBCrypto



Analyst have downplayed the long-term positive impact of the U.S. BTC ETF.
Instead, the analyst viewed the BTC ETFs as benefiting TradFi and a threat to DeFi. 

Bitcoin [BTC] went from around $40K to a new all-time of $73.7K on the back of the approval of U.S. spot BTC ETFs. 
The massive flows from institutions through the ETFs have been long viewed as a bullish catalyst for BTC price action. 
However, Jim Bianco, a macro investment research analyst, downplayed the ETFs’ ‘bullish’ catalyst narrative. 
Instead, Bianco termed the BTC ETFs as ‘pulling the money off-chain’ into TradFi, especially in Q1. 
“My other concern was that these instruments (ETFs) would not lead to on-chain adoption but instead drag money back into the TradFi world. $COIN Q1 earnings offered hints this might be the case. Coinbase revenue surges to $1.64 billion – But retail volume just 50% of 2021 levels”
According to Bianco, the Q1 BTC ETF trend was ‘pulling money off-chain into the Tradfi world’ and could undermine a new DeFi system. 
Bianco’s bearish take on U.S. Bitcoin ETFs
Bianco’s bearish stance on U.S. BTC ETF contradicted Michael Saylor and Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan’s positions. 
For his part, Michael Saylor viewed U.S. BTC ETFs as a way to move capital from TradFi into digital assets, fueling BTC’s competitiveness. 
Similarly, Hougan, based on the 13F filings, noted that large firms bought $10.7 billion of the U.S. BTC ETFs in Q1. To Hougan, the amount was a ‘down payment,’ and he expected more to come. 
However, Bianco took a contrarian position and cited two other factors for his argument. Notably, investment advisors’ holdings of BTC ETF in Q1 were below average to inspire the bullish catalyst narrative. 
“They (Investment advisors) are very small, between 2.5% and 4% (and 8.81% for $GBTC). A recent Citi report says the AVERAGE ETF is about 35% owned by investment advisors.”
Source: X/Jim Bianco
He also claimed that BTC ETFs aren’t recording massive demand as expected, and the long-term impact of BTC ETFs could have been far-fetched.  
“If anything, it is concerning that the headlong rush into Spot BTC ETFs “only” drove this price back to the old high (of November 2021) and not $100k.”
In the meantime, BTC’s short-term recovery eased near the supply area below $68K. Should bulls clear the hurdle, an extended recovery to the range-high of $71K could be feasible.

Ethereum Spot ETFs On The Horizon? US SEC Set To Announce Decision This Week | Bitcoinist.com


								The much-anticipated Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are set to reach a pivotal junction this week as Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, has revealed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to issue a final decision regarding the exchange-traded funds within the week.
Ethereum Spot ETFs Decision Looms
Since the SEC’s ruling may have a significant impact on the direction of Ethereum investment, Nate Geraci‘s revelation has increased expectations in the cryptocurrency and investment landscape.

Geraci emphasized the 19b-4s (changes to exchange rules) and S-1s (registration statements) as the two main components of the SEC’s review procedure. According to the expert, before the Ethereum spot ETFs can be launched, the regulatory watchdog must accept both filings.
When a national securities exchange, such as the NYSE or Nasdaq, wants to launch new products or change rules, they submit a filing to the SEC called a 19b-4s (Exchange Rule Changes). For ETH spot ETFs, the exchanges must obtain the SEC’s approval on the 19b-4s before listing the products and integrating them into their trading platforms.
Meanwhile, S-1s, or registration statements, are the first registration forms needed for newly sold securities to the public. They give the agency and possible investors comprehensive details on the company’s financial situation, management, and business operations. 
In the case of spot ETH ETFs, this filing will cover the fund’s administration, structure, and strategy for emulating Ethereum performance. Thus for the products to be offered to the general public legally, the S-1s and the 19b-4s need to be approved by the SEC, given the significance of both filings.
While Geraci is confident that the Commission might approve the 19b-4s, he thinks the S-1s might see a slow play from the agency, and without the S-1s clearance, the funds cannot be legally allowed to be sold to investors. 
Given the lack of engagement, this might imply an extended period of evaluation and approval of these documents from the agency. Since then, the SEC’s lack of engagement has negatively impacted the funds, which has raised questions and doubts about its approval.
Approval Or Lawsuit From The SEC
It is worth noting that Nate Geraci is one of the top figures in the crypto industry who is pessimistic about the approval of the ETH spot ETFs from the SEC. Geraci previously hinted at the agency’s eerily silence and lower level of engagement as a potential setback for the fund’s clearance in May.

Although this makes sense logically, Geraci questions whether the SEC took a lesson from the clown show when it came to spot Bitcoin ETFs. As a result, he has highlighted an approval or legal action from the Commission as two potential outcomes for the ETH spot ETFs.
Presently, the odds around the product’s acceptance are down substantially ahead of the May deadline. Data from the prediction market, Polymarket, shows that the approval odds now stand at 11%.

Litecoin (LTC) whales have embarked on a massive accumulation frenzy over the past month. This accumulation has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike, particularly due to a net inflow surge on May 10. According to IntoTheBlock, Litecoin whale addresses have accumulated 2,751,633 LTC in the last 30 days alone. The activity peaked on May 10, when whale addresses saw a net inflow of over 900,000 LTC.  This level of accumulation may imply a significant shift in the Litecoin ecosystem, indicating  growing confidence among large holders.The single-day net inflow of over 900,000 LTC on May 10 is particularly noteworthy. This marks the highest daily accumulation of whale addresses since February, indicating a major shift in whale behavior.Whales refer to large holders of a specific cryptocurrency. In the case of Litecoin, the recent accumulation by these large players might signal potential strategic positioning, possibly anticipating future price movements or reacting to market developments.As reported, the Litecoin network has processed over 245 million transactions since its inception, with a notable 39 million of those transactions occurring in 2024 alone. Whales might be positioning themselves to capitalize on Litecoin's upcoming advancements. Positive sentiment around the broader cryptocurrency market can also drive accumulation. As confidence in the market grows, large holders may increase their positions in established cryptocurrencies like Litecoin.However, the reasons behind this sudden surge in accumulation remain speculative.As the crypto community watches with bated breath, questions arise about the impact of the whales' resurgence. Will this lead to a bullish trend for Litecoin, or is it merely strategic positioning for future market development? However, the recent accumulation may indicate that whales are waking up, and the consequences may soon be felt.

Binance Research estimates token unlocks to reach $155 billion by 2030 - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The crypto market has recently witnessed a trend of tokens launching with high fully diluted valuations (FDVs) but low initial circulating supplies.This structure, often driven by venture capital (VC) funding and upbeat market sentiment, can lead to unsustainable price appreciation post-token generation event (TGE) and significant selling pressure once tokens unlock.According to a recently released report from Binance Research, aggregated data from Token Unlocks and CoinMarketCap indicate that approximately $155 billion worth of tokens will unlock between 2024 and 2030.Binance Research suggests that without increased buy-side demand, these unlocks could exert substantial downward pressure on token prices. Tokens launched in 2024 have shown the lowest market capitalization (MC) to FDV ratios in recent years, highlighting the prevalence of low circulating supplies at launch.The MC/FDV ratio for tokens launched in 2024 is just 12.3%, suggesting that a significant value of tokens will be unlocked in the future.The influx of private market capital has significantly shaped crypto market valuations. Since 2017, over $91 billion has been invested in crypto projects, driving up token prices even before public market launches. In Q1 2024, crypto deal-making activity rose by 52.1% QoQ, indicating a strong willingness among investors to fund projects at elevated valuations.Notably, the crypto market capitalization also increased by 61% in the same period, fueling positive investor sentiment and allowing projects to raise substantial capital with less dilution.This trend poses long-term risks associated with inflated valuations, the research report claims. Many new tokens have FDVs comparable to established layer-1 or DeFi tokens, despite lacking similar user traction and market presence. This discrepancy suggests a misalignment in valuations and actual market demand.On this end, Binance Research advised investors to emphasize project fundamentals such as tokenomics, valuation, product viability, and team credentials. By extension, a basic understanding of unlock schedules work, paired with thorough due diligence would be crucial to avoid the pitfalls of high FDV tokens, the paper suggests.
“Tokenomics is undoubtedly one of the most important considerations for investors and project teams. Every design decision comes with its set of benefits and trade-offs. While launching tokens with low initial circulating supply may drive initial price pumps, the steady unlocking and emission of tokens create selling pressure, weighing on long-term performance,” the report states.
Projects, on the other hand, should adopt long-term thinking in tokenomics design, ensuring equitable token distributions and considering the implications of high FDVs and low floats. Strategies such as token burning, milestone-based vesting, and increasing initial circulating supply can help mitigate future selling pressures.The trend of launching tokens with low floats and high FDVs poses significant challenges for sustainable growth. Both investors and project teams need to be mindful of the long-term implications of their decisions, Binance Research said. VC-backed projects should focus on equitable supply distributions and realistic valuations to foster a healthier market environment.

2 Trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 24 Hours: Shiba Inu (SHIB) on Verge of Surge?

Shiba Inu recently experienced a notable surge in whale-tier transactions, hinting at a possible spike in volatility. However, given the current state of SHIB, these large transactions might not yield the significant impact many are hoping for.Analyzing the provided on-chain data, we see that in the last 24 hours, there have been 82 large SHIB transactions, totaling 1.7 trillion SHIB. This aligns with the lowest activity level in the past week, highlighting a potential lack of consistent buying interest. This trend is further reflected in the transaction volume, which reached $40.48 million, considerably lower than the seven-day high of $223.76 million seen earlier in the week.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewSHIB has been hovering around the 50 EMA, struggling to break through. The Bollinger Bands indicate a narrowing, typically a precursor to a volatility spike, but without substantial volume, this might not materialize into significant price movement. The MACD histogram shows a declining trend, signaling weakening bullish momentum.The whale transactions, while substantial, might represent internal shuffling or consolidation rather than genuine market interest. This is evident from the relatively flat price movement despite high transaction volumes. For SHIB to see a substantial price surge, consistent buying pressure and increased trading volume are necessary, both of which are currently lacking.While the surge in whale transactions might initially seem like a bullish indicator, the underlying data suggests that Shiba Inu is currently in a consolidation phase. Without a significant influx of new buyers or increased trading activity, SHIB might continue to trade sideways. For now, Shiba Inu really needs fresh inflows, instead of the activity of large players who have been there before.

Is Bitcoin the next asset to catch up with the rally? | CryptoSlate

Quick TakeAs economic uncertainty looms, traditional safe-haven assets like gold, silver, and copper are soaring to new heights. Gold recently hit a new all-time high of $2,443 an ounce, up nearly 20% year-to-date. Silver is approaching $32 an ounce, its highest level since October 2012, while copper is trading above $5, an all-time high.Gold, Silver and Copper Price: (Source: TradingView)The surge in precious metals and industrial commodities can be attributed to several factors. Inflation concerns are mounting, with both 5-year and 10-year inflation expectations hovering around 2.3%, higher than central banks’ target of 2%. Inflation expectations have remained above 2% since January 2021.5 and 10 Year Breakeven Inflation Expectations: (Source: TradingView)Safe-haven demand is also driving investors towards these assets, as 11 out of the past 14 rate-hiking cycles have ended in a recession, while interest rates are at their highest level in over 20 years in the US.Furthermore, investment shifts and geopolitical uncertainties, such as ongoing wars and upcoming elections, could be contributing to the rally. A rise in copper prices can signal higher costs of goods and manufacturing or even economic growth.Despite WTI and Brent crude oil prices dropping by over 10% from their April highs, they have still registered a year-to-date increase of over 10%. This divergence may indicate the beginning of an economic slowdown as demand for oil weakens.US and UK Oil: (Source: TradingView)Interestingly, as traditional safe havens shine, Bitcoin, often touted as “digital gold” due to its limited supply, decentralization, and potential hedge against uncertainty, is trading at around $67,000. With the U.S. stock market also at all-time highs, the question arises: Is Bitcoin the next asset to catch up with the rally?

Whale Alert: WIF Price Jumps on Solana After Investor Move


							

Large investor buys new Solana memecoin WIF.



WIF price surges nearly 7% after activity.



SOL token also sees price increase, fueling speculation.




On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain identified significant trading activity surrounding WIF, a recently launched memecoin on the Solana blockchain. In a post, Lookonchain revealed that an unknown large investor has been accumulating substantial amounts  of WIF, potentially impacting the memecoin’s market performance.







Lookonchain provided transaction data highlighting the investor’s creation of a new wallet and the subsequent transfer of 1.83 million USDC to purchase WIF. As of the post’s publication, the investor had spent 606,000 USDC to acquire 227,896 WIF, leaving a remaining balance of 1.22 million USDC.



WIF’s price responded to this activity in the early hours of Monday’s trading session. The Solana-based memecoin opened at $2.53 and climbed nearly 7% within a few hours, reaching $2.69 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView.



The full impact remains unclear, with the investor still holding a significant portion of their USDC. WIF’s price could potentially rise further and attract additional users, leading to a larger buying pool within the memecoin’s ecosystem.









It’s worth noting that Lookonchain’s observation coincides with a price surge in SOL, the native token of WIF’s parent blockchain, Solana. SOL has gained 25% in less than a week, suggesting a potential return of bullish sentiment for the layer-one blockchain protocol.



TradingView data shows that SOL bounced off the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level on the daily chart last Wednesday. Since then, the scalability-focused project has seen an impressive rise, surpassing both the 0.5 and 0.382 Fibonacci levels. These developments have captured the attention of many crypto users, leading to speculation about a possible resumption of the broader crypto market rally.

Crypto gambling - how does the future of secure gambling look?



                    

                    Online gambling is a huge part of the casino world, but there is a small percentage of players who worry about its security — welcome, cryptocurrency casinos. It’s 2024, and although crypto casinos are nothing new, there is a wide range of some of the huge household names now utilizing this form of payment to stay ahead. It used to be that security processes were a major block for many players online, as when you gamble online you are putting your data, funds, and personal information in the hands of the online casino. Luckily, we’re in a new era of technology and the security methods that these brands now use are second to none. 
 If we were to look at the history of online casinos, we would see that traditional platforms struggled to build robust security methods, which left players susceptible to fraud and hackers. However, that fear is one of the past, as all online casinos that are worth playing on have to be regulated and in turn, adopt a fortress-like level of security. It not only puts you as the player in safe hands but offers up a new way of using decentralized funds, that are transparent and completely controlled by you. We’re going to be taking a look at how one of the safest forms of online gambling is evolving, and what measures shape where it’s got to today. Ever worried about online casinos before? Well, you won’t now! 
 Blockchain — what is it?
 
If you were looking for one advancement to thank in this evolving secure digital landscape, then it would most definitely be blockchain. Although to many it sounds unmeasurably confusing, it’s a piece of technology that works wonders in online gambling. Blockchain is a decentralized digital piece of technology that acts as a record sheet for transactions. It is a secure, transparent piece of tech that, in summary, is a digital ledger/database. It stores the transactions in things called blocks, which are then linked by a chain… sounds obvious, right?
 Each and every block that is formed on this digital ledger then contains an individual yet unique cryptographic node that cannot be modified as the chain goes on. Therefore, in summary, as the chain progresses, it becomes inevitably stronger and unable to be hacked or tampered with. It’s also getting more valuable all the time.
 It is the undisputed heavyweight in all security processes and stands as the backbone of anything cryptocurrency-related. 
 But how does it keep your information safe in gambling?
 

Immutability — This means that it is unable to be changed, ever. When a piece of data has been recorded on the ledger (blockchain), it is then unable to be altered. This creates a transparent record in a casino, showing that all bets have been safely placed and will never be tampered with.
Decentralization — Like everything with crypto, when using crypto in a casino, it becomes completely decentralized. This cuts out any third parties such as banks, and therefore reduces potential threats. Although you may think your funds are safe with the central banks, they are far more susceptible to hackers than if they were placed in a virtual crypto wallet — hence why they’re the future of online gambling.
Fairer — Above all else, when you’re gambling online, one of the most important requests is fairness. Blockchain makes sure that all the algorithms in a casino’s interface are fully leveled out, meaning that crypto pokies are guaranteed to be treated equally with all their pay-ins, pay-outs, and hand/slot automation. 

 
The future of privacy and transparency 
 
Online gambling is only growing exponentially because both crypto and blockchain are putting support in place for its players. Crypto gives the player a whole new level of anonymity, while blockchain dishes up transparent records for safeguarding their data. This opposes the older methods of online casinos, as pre-crypto users would use traditional payment methods that resulted in your data being shared, and potentially hacked. Before crypto was utilized by online casinos, players would have to input a lot more personal data — which would put them at risk of identity fraud. Now, the online player uses a virtual wallet that is decentralized and secure from all threats. 
 The role of cryptocurrency is growing and the future of it is only getting more resilient against security worries. As of early 2024, there are 13,217 cryptocurrencies in existence, with new ones appearing all the time — and this is expected to grow by the end of the year. We’re in an era where technological changes are inevitable, and to stay ahead as a business, you need to adopt change. This makes customers in online gambling feel safe, and encourages them to utilize the platforms that prioritize their safety above all else. 
 With every bet you place being recorded on the blockchain and every payout you receive being fully untraceable — secure gambling is not just the future, it’s the now.

                        Cryptonews Podcast host Matt Zahab recently sat down for a chat with Tomer Pascal, the CEO and co-founder of OwnPlay, a Web3 mobile gaming ecosystem and developer of CityVerse Tycoon, a PWA game allowing players to trade, buy, and sell tokenized replicas of real buildings in New York City, USA.Pascal talked about the advantages of Web3 gaming over Web2, deciding to avoid Apple and Google for its game, succeeding in creating a PWA game, and the exciting launches coming very soon.VIDEOWeb3 Advances Gameplay
It was 2022 when Pascal reached out to his old colleague Boaz Levin about creating a startup together. Pascal found that the time was finally right for the Web3 gaming.Their joint endeavor eventually became OwnPlay.“Creating a mobile Web3 game presents a big opportunity,” he said to Levin.Web2 became heavily dependent on paid customer acquisition. But Web3 elements are exciting, he said.They allow people to finally leverage gameplay to provide the players themselves an option “for a potential financial upside from the gameplay itself.”If done correctly, it can add a new level of excitement to the gameplay and continue the Web3 narrative, sad Pascal.Evading Apple and Google
OwnPlay created CityVerse Tycoon to provide its players with a seamless experience, Pascal told Matt.However, the team had a giant conundrum – Apple and Google. “How the hell are we going to bypass this,” they wondered.Apple Store and Google Play are extremely unfriendly to anything crypto-related. Getting approval for a Web3 game with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) would be impossible.These companies are primarily protecting their own interests – primarily, financial interests. These may or may not align with user interests.What they do not align with is the on-chain experience. These two methods are not compatible.Several years ago, nobody would take the suggestion of bypassing these two giants seriously. One of the reasons is that “life in the App Store was still good.”And even now, the team wasn’t happy about it, but times have changed for games, as well as both Apple and Google.The team decided to take “the crazy path” of trying to build the game as a mobile app but without running through the app store.There is a way of doing this, he said, noting that the team wasn’t the first to think about it but “the first one that was crazy enough to actually go do this.”To accomplish this, they utilized the progressive web application (PWA) protocol.“Long story short, we are able to provide an app-like experience without going through the App Store. If you need to take something from this call, that’s the thing.”The Great Experiment
Necessity is the mother of all invention. When it came to running a game as a PWA, the time found that there are no issues with performance and monetization.They were left with a big question: can you actually market the PWA? Can you convince people to install it?They started by running ads on Facebook and Instagram. The early results were good.__The team continued optimizing and building the game while driving traffic. “And then we saw that the conversion rates are on par or better than a mobile native app.”They proceeded with retention and monetization, finding that “numbers were on par.”Now they have more than 100,000 installs of the PWA already. Notably, people are unable to distinguish a PWA from an app, so they’re treating the game as a regular app.Launches Coming Up
Pascal said that the team is gearing up for the public launch of the game’s new version, currently set for May.This version has “all of the Web3 elements baked into the game.”The main elements include the ability to purchase and sell buildings.These buildings are NFTs with different game powers and perceived value by the players.Another element is the introduction of an additional coin in the game. Its utility will be revealed “later on.”Every user gets a non-custodial embedded wallet, while the buildings can be purchased using fiat and crypto. The seller is paid with crypto.Another thing coming up a collection that the team will mint in the upcoming weeks, called the Piggy Club.The NFTs’ main utility is boosting players’ in-game earnings, said Pascal.Users can accrue game value and rewards in the Piggy Bank game.Notably, the Piggy Club collection will be a “small one,” with few units, Pascal remarked.____That’s not all.Tomer Pascal also discussed:
establishing his first startup in 2006, a fantasy sports platform game with a twist;
meeting his current co-founder, Boaz, in 2009 and starting CityVerse Tycoon together in 2022;
creating a game with many games within it;
the decision to build the game as a PWA rather than a traditional mobile app, and how this benefits distribution and monetization for mobile gaming;
the opportunity and unparalleled accessibility that mobile offers for Web3 gaming;
challenges of creating and operating a mobile Web3 game;
the ‘David and Goliath’ struggle between crypto apps and centralized app stores;
constraints in distribution and monetization on mobile — specifically when it comes to rules set forth by app marketplaces.

Web3 Teams Compete To Bring Restaking To $1.2T Bitcoin Ecosystem - The Defiant

Developers are racing to leverage BTC to replicate Ethereum's booming restaking ecosystem. DeFi developers are competing to replicate the explosive growth generated by Ethereum’s restaking sector within the ecosystem.On May 20, BounceBit, a “CeDeFi’ Layer 1 network backed by Binance, the popular centralized exchange, published its roadmap for 2024. In the document, BounceBit said it plans to develop a “shared security client module” allowing third-party projects to utilize the liquidity deposited on the “BounceBit BTC restaking chain.”BounceBit celebrated its mainnet launch on May 13, claiming to have amassed a total value locked (TVL) of more than $1 billion after launching an incentivized early access phase on Jan. 30.The BounceBit chain is secured by users who stake both its native BB token and Bitcoin (BTC). BounceBit’s new roadmap seeks to expand on this with the introduction of restaking by allowing third-party protocols to harness its staking mechanism for security.BounceBit’s roadmap also includes improving BounceBit’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution, bolstering transaction throughput, and upgrading communication between its EVM and the Cosmos software development kit.Restaking boomRestaking was pioneered on Ethereum by EigenLayer. EigenLayer allows Ethereum stakers to earn additional yield by simultaneously pledging their stake to secure third-party actively validated services (AVSs) while also securing the Ethereum network. However, restakers incur additional slashing risks, meaning their stake will be diminished should delegated AVSs misbehave.EigenLayer has surged to become the second-largest DeFi protocol with a more than $15.3 TVL. The protocol’s growth was recently buoyed by the explosive rise of liquid restaking tokens (LRT) protocols, which reduce the technical barriers to participating in restaking and enable additional yield generation by allowing users to remain liquid.Projects tap Babylon as middleware for Bitcoin restakingBounceBit is not the first project aiming to bring restaking onto Bitcoin, with several projects leveraging Babylon, a Cosmos-based Bitcoin staking network, to develop BTC-based restaking products.Babylon is a Cosmos-based network allowing Bitcoin holders to “stake” their BTC to secure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks in exchange for yield.On May 16, Mind Network, a restaking-focused Layer 1 network, announced a strategic alliance with Babylon. Per the deal, users will be able to secure Mind-based sub-networks by staking Babylon-based LRTs.On May 2, Bedrock, an LRT protocol, launched uniBTC, a Babylon-based Bitcoin liquid restaking token. UniBTC allows BTC holders to participate in Babylon staking without locking up their assets, meaning holders can remain liquid while securing PoS chains.On April 1, Lorenzo protocol similarly unveiled stBTC, a Babylon-based Bitcoin LRT.

US Enactment With First-Ever Crypto Legislation


                                President Joe Biden To Veto US Congress Standalone Crypto Legislation                                What’s The NewsIn a historic move, the U.S. Congress enacted its first piece of standalone cryptocurrency legislation last week. The contentious Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intended to be overturned by the bill. This law represents a critical turning point in the regulation of cryptocurrencies and suggests future adjustments to the way financial institutions manage digital assets. However, President Joe Biden has warned that he will veto this due to concerns about financial system stability and market volatility.The SAB 121 of U.S. SEC RuleAccording to SAB 121, companies that retain cryptocurrency assets for users must record them on their balance sheets as liabilities and the accompanying assets at fair value. This legislation has drawn criticism for placing banks and other financial institutions under excessive financial strain. This could discourage them from providing custody services for cryptocurrency assets. SAB 121 which House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-NC) described as an example of SEC Chair Gary Gensler's regulatory overreach renders it prohibitively expensive for financial institutions to protect the digital assets of their consumers.Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) of the United States praised the Senate for passing the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal SAB 121, describing it as a win for financial innovation and a scathing critique of the Biden administration's approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. Congress can examine and even repeal regulations produced by federal agencies thanks to the CRA. Earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to reverse SAB 121 and last week, the Senate approved the measure. President Joe Biden On Crypto RegulationPresident Joe Biden strongly opposed Congress’s decision to overturn SAB 121. A White House statement claims that restricting the SEC's capacity to uphold an extensive and successful financial regulatory framework for cryptocurrency assets might significantly increase market volatility and financial instability. This position demonstrates the administration's worries about the possible consequences of relaxing crypto restrictions.ConclusionAs per CoinGabbar, With the ongoing debate on cryptocurrency regulation across the United States, it is notable that the U.S. Congress adopted the first stand-alone crypto bill. Critics argue that such a law would pose a threat to financial security and exchange market integrity while advocates consider it as a way to facilitate financial development and limit the power of regulators. The future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States is still a hotly debated and closely monitored topic as the legislative process moves forward. Also Read: Blockchain Gaming Investment Hit $1 Billion In April

Bitcoin Edges Past $67K as Analysts Predict It'll Keep Climbing - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin is starting the week having seen monthly highs over $67,000 over the weekend and early this morning.At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price has retraced slightly to $66,868.04 after having dropped 0.4% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. That means the world's oldest and largest cryptocurrency now has a $1.3 trillion market capitalization and accounts for more than half the $2.5 trillion global crypto market cap.The sunny disposition of Bitcoin price charts has some analysts breathing a sigh of relief."Bitcoin broke the local downtrend, reclaimed the previous cycle highs - and now consolidates around $67,000," wrote pseudonymous crypto trader Jelle on Twitter. "It's time to push back into the seventies, and beyond."At the start of the month, Bitcoin billionaire Arthur Hayes wrote in a blog post that he expected a few weeks of choppy and volatile prices before things improved. And before that, he shared his bearish outlook for the recent BTC halving, writing: "I believe Bitcoin and crypto prices in general will slump around the halving."Last week, in a note to traders, Singapore-based digital asset firm QCP Capital hypothesized that enough time has now elapsed since the Bitcoin halving for BTC to start climbing again."It is now 28 days past the BTC halving and post-halving dip might be done," the firm wrote. The QCP analysts also noted that there's been a growing amount of interest in December call options—"indicating significant bullishness into year-end."At the time of writing, there's $1.6 billion worth of open interest in BTC futures contracts on Deribit, according to Coinglass. The crypto derivatives exchange tends to be the most popular for trading BTC futures contracts. Even so, total open interest for Bitcoin is currently at $20 billion, so sentiment still hasn't crystallized the way it did leading up to the Bitcoin halving when total open interest went north of $30 billion.The seemingly relieved trader sentiment appears to be in line with the most recent BLS Consumer Price Index last week showed signs that inflation in the U.S. had started to ease.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitcoin Eyes New Highs as Analysts Spot Imminent Golden Cross on Lower Timeframes



                    

Bitcoin maintained upward pressure on liquidity on May 17 as analysts noted a potential golden cross on lower timeframes.



Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC price action hovering near its highest levels since mid-April.




Liquidity at $67,000 and above continued to act as a barrier, with around $75 million at stake at the time of writing, according to monitoring resource CoinGlass.



Although still below its all-time highs of 2024 and 2021, Bitcoin sparked enthusiasm among market observers. Popular pseudonymous trader Moustache highlighted two significant trendlines.



“Golden Cross (12h-Chart) of $BTC is imminent,” he informed his followers in one of his recent posts on X (formerly Twitter).



A golden cross happens when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term one, with the last occurrence in October of the previous year — just before Bitcoin saw significant gains.



“The last bullish cross was over six months ago. Bitcoin has risen by over 170% since then,” Moustache noted.



Another trader, Titan of Crypto, suggested that the Ichimoku Cloud indicator might follow a similar trend.

“BTC seems to be repeating the same pattern from early 2024,” a part of an X post on May 16 read, adding that BTC/USD saw an upside of more than 60% the last time Ichimoku requirements were met.



Titan of Crypto also pointed out a transfer of $60,000 from resistance to support.




As reported by Cointelegraph, this area includes various bull market trendlines, all converging in one place.



Among these are the short-term holder realized price and the 100-day moving average, the latter rising quickly and now above $62,000.



“BTC is perfectly flipping previous resistance into support,” Titan of Crypto summarized, sharing an Ichimoku chart.



Overall, Bitcoin’s current trajectory and technical indicators suggest a potentially bullish outlook, with significant levels being tested and possibly transformed into new support zones.

                        In today’s top news, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) has experienced an increase in transaction activity, with the number of transactions more than doubling from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the end of the first quarter of 2024.According to Ripple’s Q1 2024 XRP Markets Report, the increase in activity came as the average transaction cost witnessed a notable decline.During the first quarter of the year, the XRPL recorded approximately 251.39 million on-chain transactions, marking a remarkable 108% surge compared to the 121.03 million transactions in Q4 2023.Furthermore, the average cost per transaction decreased by 45%, reaching around $0.000856.No Network Congestion Happened in Q1
The report emphasized that the decrease in average transaction costs indicated a reset and demonstrated that no network congestion occurred during the quarter.The development is positive news for users of the XRP Ledger, as lower transaction costs can enhance accessibility and encourage increased activity on the network.In terms of trading volume, the report highlighted the steady distribution among cryptocurrency exchanges.Binance, Bybit, and Upbit accounted for more than 70% of the total traded volume, maintaining their dominance in XRP trading.However, there was a slight shift in trading pairs, with the proportion of volume traded via fiat pairs dropping from 15% in Q4 to 11% in Q1.Currently, a significant portion of XRP trading occurs against Tether (USDT).The report also addressed the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The SEC filed a lawsuit in December 2020, alleging that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering with XRP.Ripple responded to the SEC’s request for $2 billion in remedies on April 22, disagreeing with the demand.The firm argued that the law does not allow the SEC to require disgorgement or interest on disgorgement unless they can prove harm.“In terms of next steps, both parties will wait for the Judge to make a determination on the final remedies – likely in the coming months,” Ripple explained.“Ripple remains confident that the Judge will approach the remedies phase fairly.”In Other XRP News – Ripple Expands in Africa
Ripple has announced plans to introduce XRP Ledger and crypto-native services, including custody solutions, in Africa. The move aligns with Ripple’s vision to leverage blockchain technology for cross-border payments and more.Last year, Ripple announced it obtained a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI). The Central Bank of Ireland initiated the registration process for the VASP license in 2021, focusing on ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism provisions.

                        TON cryptocurrency NOTcoin, the brainchild of co-creator Sasha Plotvinov, launched on major centralized exchanges on 16 May last week to much fanfare – where is the coin price headed next?The price spiked briefly, which saw the token gatecrash into the top 100 crypto with a market capitalization above $1 billion. However, two hours after the start of trading the price had fallen back to $0.0062.Since then, the price has found a floor at around $0.0054 on the Binance exchange, after touching a low of $0.0051.However, the price action is not as bad as it looks at first glance, given that the owners of the $NOT token had acquired their stash through mining a tap-to-earn token by playing the viral clicker game on Telegram.The mined in-game token was used to claim the $NOT coin prior to the start of trading. Five million people claimed Notcoin within the first 36 hours of trading:Originally envisaged as a way of introducing the masses to crypto, $NOT’s game walks the newbie through hooking up a TON-compatible crypto wallet, saving the seed phrase and then getting started with the clicks.VIDEOWith billions of tokens in the bank, so to speak, players took advantage of the opportunity to sell at the list price of $0.009471. Trading volume in the first 24 hours reached $1.18 billion.TON cryptocurrency NOTcoin – from crypto experiment to half a billion dollars market capitalization
$TON currently has a market capitalization of $574 million, ranking it 121st out the the 9,961 tokens listed on Coinmarketcap.All of this is not too shabby for a coin that promised its players ‘probably nothing’ as part of its marketing messaging.Plotvinov’s game wasn’t just about mindless clicking, as hypnotically pleasing as that seemed to be for some dopamine junkies, as they sought prominence on the leaderboard. Rather, the game was primarily envisaged as a way of introducing the masses to how crypto networks worked.For instance, rewards were also earned from taking part in various campaigns, such as installing the TON Space wallet. Telegram premium users also received extra rewards for various tasks and contributions.Such was the popularity of the clicker game, it even boosted sales of mechanical clickers on e-commerce platforms eBay and Alibaba.Enabling participation in the Notcoin phenomenon is its community bot, which leverages Telegram’s tried-and-tested bot ecosystem to deliver a user-friendly experience.Notcoin has amassed 35 million players of its clicker game, providing a huge captive audience for the coin.The Open Network (TON) traces its birth back to the Telegram app, developed by Nikolai and Pavel Durov (Pavel is the CEO of Telegram). In-game mining ended on April 1, with token claiming starting on Tuesday.In addition to selling $NOT, holders can also opt to stake it or simply ‘hodl’ in their self-custody wallet.Since Telegram ran into regulatory issues with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the TON network has been run by the TON Foundation and is no longer officially connected with Telegram for its governance, although is effectively the native token of the platform.After an X poll of community members in January asking whether $NOT should be minted and listed as a token, not surprisingly 69.9% voted yes.Binance, OKX and Bybit are among the top exchanges listing $NOT
Through assiduous cultivation of the support of crypto OG influencers and the enthusiastic backing of the clicker game community, a coordinated successful launch across some of the top crypto trading venues was executed.Among the exchanges involved were, Binance, OKX and Bybit – the first, third and fourth-ranked spot exchanges on Coinmarketcap. On the Bybit launchpool there are still three days left to get free NOTcoin.Because of the regulatory kerfuffle with the SEC, US exchanges have avoided listing TON-based coins.For instance, Coinbase does not list Toncoin or associated tokens. The same goes for Kraken, Gemini, and others.According to Plotvinov, the Telegram app has only about 100 million crypto-savvy users, but it is expected to reach one billion users by the end of the year.Notcoin’s mission is to bridge that gap by extending crypto’s reach through building applications with mass market appeal. Plotvinov’s Open Builders TON developer studio team is now pivoting to launch more games and encourage other developers to build on the TON network.Telegram is a popular home to a growing band of crypto casinosIndicative of its growing popularity, Telegram has become home to a number of lucrative crypto casino platforms, notably TG.Casino, Lucky Block and Mega Dice, which all have Telegram ‘no kyc’ versions of their gambling businesses on the app. Mega Dice is currently in presale and has raised over $ 1 million from contributors.VIDEONotcoin plans to relaunch its clicker game, this time with players able to directly mine $NOT coin instead of an in-game token that has to be exchanged for $NOT in the claiming process, as previously was the case.Still, because all Notcoin has now been minted and deployed, a new play-to-earn model is being worked up.In an encouraging move for whale buyers, in a Telegram post Pavel Durov said he is holding onto the $6.8 million worth of $NOTcoin he was gifted until it grows 100x in value.With endorsements like that, trading volume in $NOT remains elevated. Coinmarketcap ranks it the 40th most traded coin. With the price now finding a floor, buyers of Notcoin are likely to remain plentiful.

Ethereum funds face $23 million in outflows amid ETF uncertainty - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Ethereum (ETH) crypto funds suffered over $23 million in weekly outflows, despite digital asset products witnessing $932 million in inflows for the same period, according to asset management firm CoinShares. The outflows are tied to a growing skepticism over the likelihood of the SEC approving a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US.Bitcoin remained the favored asset, attracting $942 million in inflows, while there was a negligible amount directed towards short Bitcoin positions, indicating a generally positive investor outlook. Altcoins also experienced inflows, with Solana, Chainlink, and Cardano receiving $4.9 million, $3.7 million, and $1.9 million, respectively.Crypto funds weekly flows. Image: CoinSharesThe overall trading volume was a mere $10.5 billion for the week, a stark contrast to the $40 billion seen in March. The increase in inflows appears to be a direct reaction to a lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released on Wednesday, with the latter three trading days contributing 89% of the week’s total inflows. This pattern suggests that Bitcoin prices are once again closely tied to interest rate expectations.Regionally, the US led the charge with inflows of $1 billion. Grayscale, which had experienced significant outflows amounting to $16.6 billion since its ETF launch in January, saw its first inflows of $18 million in a notable shift.Minor inflows were also recorded in Switzerland and Germany, totaling $27 million and $4.2 million, respectively. On the flip side, Hong Kong and Canada faced outflows of $83 million and $17 million.Blockchain equities have been facing a challenging year, with outflows in 14 of the 20 weeks thus far, resulting in a cumulative outflow of $512 million.

Crypto Crackdown: Venezuela Goes Dark on Mining to Ease Grid Overload


								Venezuelans, once seeking solace in the digital gold rush, now face a harsh reality. The country, grappling with hyperinflation and economic instability, has banned all crypto mining farms connected to the national grid.
This decision, announced by the Venezuelan National Power Ministry, prioritizes the crumbling power grid over the once-booming crypto industry.

From Hope To Headaches: The Rise And Fall Of Crypto Mining In Venezuela
For many Venezuelans, cryptocurrency mining emerged as a beacon of hope. With the country’s currency, the Bolivar, in a state of freefall, digital assets offered a chance to generate income and hedge against inflation.
Venezuela’s incredibly low electricity costs further fueled the allure of crypto mining. Homes and businesses buzzed with the whirring of specialized computers, relentlessly churning out digital coins.
However, this digital El Dorado came at a heavy price. The surge in mining activity placed a massive strain on the nation’s already fragile power grid.
The result? More frequent and prolonged blackouts, plunging entire communities into darkness and disrupting daily life. The government, facing mounting pressure and public frustration, could no longer ignore the energy crisis.

A Fork In The Road: Balancing Power Needs With Livelihoods
Governor Rafael Lacava of Carabobo state emerged as the face of the government’s crackdown. Lacava spearheaded a series of decisive actions, leading to the seizure of over 11,000 ASICs, specialized hardware used for mining, and the shuttering of numerous mining farms. He even enlisted the public, urging citizens to report any suspected illegal mining operations.

Lacava emphasized the critical need to stabilize the power grid. “These measures are essential,” he declared. The recurring blackouts, he said, have crippled the economy and caused immense hardship for Venezuelans. “We need a reliable electricity supply for our homes, hospitals, and businesses,” he pointed out.
The Future Of Crypto In Venezuela: Uncertain And Unpowered
The ban, however, presents a new set of challenges. Many Venezuelans, particularly those in economically depressed regions, had come to rely on crypto mining for their livelihood.
The sudden loss of this income source adds another layer of hardship to their already precarious existence. The government has yet to announce any specific support programs for those impacted by the ban.

The future of cryptocurrency mining in Venezuela remains shrouded in uncertainty. The authorities haven’t clarified whether the ban is permanent.
While the move ensures a more stable power grid in the short term, it raises concerns about the long-term viability of the fledgling crypto industry within the country.

Notorious Crypto Drainer Pink Drainer Retires After Stealing Over $85 Million



                    

In a surprise announcement on Telegram, Pink Drainer, a notorious crypto-wallet draining kit, declared its retirement after successfully facilitating the theft of over $85 million in crypto assets.



“After this message’s publication, we will begin winding down all of our infrastructure. All stored information will be wiped and securely destroyed,” stated the announcement.




The developer behind Pink Drainer, known as Pink, refused to comment further when approached by Cointelegraph, simply saying, “I do not wish to comment. Bye.” 



Following this, Pink deleted the entire Telegram chat history.



CryptoSleuth ZachXBT shared a screenshot of Pink Drainer’s final announcement, revealing that the drainware service had shut down after stealing over $75 million. 




PeckShieldAlert also reported on the shutdown, noting that Pink Drainer addresses had staked up to 18.1 million Dai into Spark, accounting for approximately 1.35% of the total sDAI tokens.



Data from Dune Analytics indicates that since July 2023, over $85 million has been stolen from more than 21,100 victims.



The Pink Drainer Telegram channel has since rebranded to “Bonadifier.”

It now features an image of Bonad, described as a drainer with a mental disability, along with the message, “never forget what he took from you.”



Pink Drainer’s toolkit was responsible for stealing $53 million from over 9,000 “participants” in 2023. 



The security researcher behind Pink Drainer defended the service, stating, “I don’t phish, I just code.”



This announcement continues a trend among high-profile crypto drainers. 



In November 2023, Inferno Drainer ceased operations after stealing $70 million, following Monkey Drainer, which shut down in March 2023 after facilitating the theft of $13 million.



While the closure of drainer services like Pink Drainer provides temporary relief for crypto users, the ongoing presence of other drainers, such as Angel Drainer, indicates that the threat remains. 



In February, Angel Drainer stole over $400,000 from 128 crypto wallets by targeting users with a malicious Safe Vault contract.

Chainlink (LINK) Bullish Rally May Lead to Imminent Correction


Chainlink’s (LINK) price broke out of the consolidation and marked a monthly high of less than a week.
However, this may lead to LINK holders moving to sell their holdings before they lose the chance to secure their gains.
Chainlink Investors May Book Profits

Chainlink’s price is $16.8 after rising nearly 30% this past week. However, this resulted in the altcoin hitting saturation, historically synonymous with corrections.
This is evident in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100, with values above 70 indicating overbought conditions and below 30 indicating oversold conditions.
Currently, the RSI is above 70, suggesting LINK is overbought on the 12-hour chart. This happened last in February, after which the rally took a break. The same could be the fate of Chainlink’s price as well.

Plus, it could face additional discomfort from its investors should it move to sell, which is a probable outcome. This is because the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) signals profit-taking.
The MVRV ratio tracks investor gains/losses. Chainlink’s 30-day MVRV of 16% suggests profit, possibly prompting selling. Historically, LINK tends to correct at MVRV levels of 10%- 20%, labeling this a risky zone.

Such is the situation with Chainlink; investors could move to secure their gains, signaling a drawdown.
LINK Price Prediction: Return to $15 Likely

Chainlink’s price, trading at $16.8, breached multiple resistances to push past the resistance at $16.5. Closer to $17.0, the altcoin is noting a major rally. However, this push that brought LINK to a monthly high could also cause a decline.
Should the aforementioned conditions turn out to be true, Chainlink’s price could fall back to $15.0. Once the support at $15.6 is broken, this would happen, possibly extending the decline to $14.4.

However, if the investors do not move to sell and the rally continues to rise, Chainlink’s price could continue to rise. Crossing $17.5 would invalidate the bearish thesis, pushing LINK towards $18.

Flipped Cat (FLICAT) Will Surge 8,300% Before Bitrue, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Flipped Cat (FLICAT) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Flipped Cat (FLICAT), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Flipped Cat presents a similar opportunity.



Flipped Cat has a market cap below $17,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,300% in the coming two days ahead of it being listed on giant crypto exchange Bitrue, and Flipped Cat could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap.




Currently, Flipped Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Flipped Cat on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Flipped Cat by entering its contract address – JDCyeohyUFrxX31t4tY8Fe5LzMWkstAMaVHuH8Lq71Z1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like FLICAT.

Which Altcoins Will Binance List? Here is the New Strategy! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, continues its altcoin listings at full speed, it significantly moves the price of the relevant altcoin with its listings.
While investors were looking forward to Binance listing new altcoins, a new statement came from the exchange regarding the altcoin listing policy.


At this point, Binance stated that it is considering listing cryptocurrencies that do not have a high market value but attract the attention of the masses.

“Binance is committed to promoting a healthy and sustainable market environment and always putting our users' interests first.
In recent months, we have observed a trend of tokens with initially low circulating supply being launched at high valuations.
At this point, Binance will step in and lead the rollout of small and medium-sized projects to support a healthy industry with a variety of market participants, including low- and medium-value projects.
We would like to invite such high-quality teams and projects to apply for our listing programs, which include direct listing, Launchpools, Megadrops and more.
We hope to support small and medium-sized projects with strong foundations, an organic community base, a sustainable business model and a dedicated team that acts as responsible industry participants, and with this support we hope to increase the development of the blockchain ecosystem.
“As we collectively strive to develop a more balanced and robust market environment, we invite all eligible projects to apply to be listed on Binance.”

Bitcoin Nears Key $67,500 Resistance: New All-Time Highs Ahead?


Bitcoin’s price action has shown significant improvement recently. Prices rebounded towards the late April resistance zone of $67,500, surpassing early May highs of $64,000. 
According to 10X Research, the Bitcoin breakout could lead to new all-time highs. The research firm’s Bitcoin ETF model supports these predictions.
Why Analysts Are Bullish on Bitcoin Recovery?

The report highlights the importance of the $68,300 “line-in-the-sand.” Surpassing this level could trigger a strong rally. Bitcoin currently trades bullishly, with $67,500 being the next critical breakthrough level. 
Selling pressure remains subdued. However, market structure and fundamentals still pose challenges. The bull market is searching for a significant narrative to ignite investor interest. 
Read more: Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030
Despite these challenges, Bitcoin’s downside appears limited. Inflation data is unlikely to rise significantly, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has ruled out rate hikes. 

This environment is conducive to resuming Bitcoin ETF inflows from long-only investors. Multi-strategy funds may stay on the sidelines due to low funding rates and weak retail trading volumes.
A gradual increase in Bitcoin prices is anticipated, contrasting with the explosive rally seen earlier in the year. A stronger US stock market and support from the US Presidential election cycle could bolster this bullish narrative. 
Bitcoin closed the week at approximately $66,300, up by over 10% since May 13. Most of the price increase occurred on Wednesday, while the rest of the week exhibited relatively stable price action.

Crypto analyst Jelle echoes 10X Research’s bullish forecast. He notes that Bitcoin broke the local downtrend, reclaimed previous cycle highs, and now consolidates around $67,000. 

“It’s time to push back into the seventies, and beyond,” Jelle said.

According to Matteo Greco, a research analyst at digital assets company Fineqia, last week’s positive price movement was also driven by increased demand for BTC Spot ETFs. 


“After five weeks of low demand, resulting in about $1 billion in cumulative net outflows, BTC Spot ETFs saw about $950 million in net inflows last week, reflecting a demand level not seen since March,” Greco told BeInCrypto.

Moreover, Santiment data indicates that Bitcoin wallets holding less than 0.1 BTC have reduced their total holdings by 0.46% over the past week.

“Historically, small wallets dumping their coins to larger wallets is an encouraging and bullish sign for BTC,” Santiment wrote.

Week 19 of spot Bitcoin ETF trading saw a net inflow of $948 million with a trading volume of $8.5 billion.What Happened: This marks a positive weekly inflow compared to the past eight weeks, with the weekly Bitcoin BTC/USD candle closing above the middle line of the current correction phase.Despite this, Bitcoin still in a correction phase, suggesting that the price might not see significant highs in the near term.Key Developments In The ETF SpaceETF Store President Nate Geraci tweeted on Monday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will make a decision on Ethereum spot ETF applications this week.This decision could be pivotal for the mainstream adoption of Ethereum ETH/USD, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Geraci highlighted that the SEC’s decision process involves the approval of both a 19b-4 application, which pertains to changes in trading rules, and an S-1 registration statement. While it is technically possible for the SEC to approve the 19b-4 applications, they might delay the approval of the S-1 registration statements, especially given the reported lack of participation and engagement from some stakeholders.Also Read: ‘The Dogecoin Explosion Made Something Click In Me:’ Veteran Trader Shares Secrets To Turning Pennies Into Millions With Meme CoinsBitcoin Spot ETFs Witness Substantial InflowsThis anticipated decision on the Ethereum spot ETF comes at a time when Bitcoin spot ETFs are experiencing substantial inflows. On May 17, the total net inflow for Bitcoin spot ETFs reached $222 million, according to data from SoSo Value.The most notable inflows were:
$31.6116 million into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC.



$99.4283 million into the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC.



$38.0829 million into the iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT.
The total net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETFs now stands at $56.263 billion.This growing interest in Bitcoin ETFs underscores the increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.These developments in the Bitcoin ETF market could also positively impact the Ethereum market if the SEC approves the Ethereum spot ETF. Such an approval would likely attract significant investment, further legitimizing Ethereum as a mainstream financial asset.Future Insights At Benzinga’s Digital Assets EventFor more in-depth insights into these regulatory developments and their implications for the broader digital asset landscape, industry leaders, investors, and policymakers will gather at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.The event promises to provide valuable discussions on the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial system.Read Next: Retail Trading Legend Roaring Kitty Returns After Three Years—Can He Spark Another Frenzy?

                        SHIB has fallen to $0.00002394 today, with the Shiba Inu price dropping by 2.5% as the crypto market as a whole falls by 0.5% in the past 24 hours.While SHIB is actually up by 1.5% in the past week, it’s down by 6% in a fortnight, following a fall May 6-13 that it so far hasn’t quite recovered from.However, the ever-popular meme token remains up by 4.5% in a week and by 175% in the past year, giving it strong medium- and long-term momentum.This means that now would be an opportune time to buy the dip, with the Shiba Inu price likely to peak again soon.Shiba Inu Price Prediction as SHIB Drops 2.5% in 24 Hours – Time to Buy the Dip?
After a dip overnight, SHIB has actually recovered a little momentum this morning, even if it has stopped rising within the past couple of hours.Its relative strength index (purple) has risen back up to 50, after dropping below 30, a sign that some buyers have already bought the dip.Source: TradingViewAt the same time, SHIB’s 30-day average (orange) looks like it’s just about to drop below the 200-day average (blue), something which could portend further falls in the near term.Yet the recovery of the past couple of hours could help it avoid such a fate, with the coin potentially returning to growth very soon.What’s also interesting is that the token’s support (green) and resistance (red) levels are sliding towards each other, something that usually predicts a big move.This could be in either direction, with SHIB’s relatively low volume – at $300 million today – making the coin more vulnerable to volatility.As the tweet above indicates, whales have been selling SHIB in recent days, undermining any sense that we’re currently in an accumulation phase.However, given that the coin has fallen far enough in the past couple of weeks, it seems like it’s time for it to make a comeback.It could reach $0.000025 in the next few weeks, with its longer-term prospects depending largely on the trajectory of the wider market.For instance, if the Fed does cut rates later in the year, then the market will respond accordingly, with prices rising across the board.This will include the Shiba Inu price, which will also benefit from SHIB’s fundamentals as a token.Such fundamentals stem from Shiba Inu’s recent efforts to boost its utility, including the launch of Shibarium last year and the upcoming launch of a privacy-focused layer-three network.Alternative Meme Tokens for Market-Beating Returns
Traders wanting alternatives to SHIB may do well to check out one of the newer meme tokens impressing investors at the moment, including several presale coins that could surge when they list.A great example of this is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain crypto that has raised more than $15 million in its presale.Source: DogeverseDogeverse has been able to raise so much money so quickly because of its strong tokenomics and fundamentals, with the coin poised to become the first ever multi-chain Doge-themed meme token.As such, it will run on Ethereum and bridge to Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche, and Base.Its existence on multiple chains will mean that it potentially gains wider application than it would have otherwise, with the coin aiming to gain traction on multiple apps and platforms.Its tokenomics are also bullish, with the coin having a hard cap of 120 million, meaning that rising demand will make it deflationary.Holders will also be able to stake DOGEVERSE for a passive income, an incentive that could see a big portion of the coin’s supply exiting circulation.VIDEOInvestors can buy some now before the sale ends by heading to the official Dogeverse website, with 1 DOGEVERSE costing $0.00031.This is its final presale price, with coin looking ready to surge once it gets on trading platforms.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Whales Accumulate Over $16,781,000,000 in Bitcoin Since ETF Launch As BTC Enters Institutional Era: IntoTheBlock - The Daily Hodl


								New data from market intelligence firm IntoTheBlock reveals that deep-pocketed crypto investors have accumulated tens of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin since BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched in January.
In a new article, IntoTheBlock says that the top crypto asset by market cap’s era of institutional adoption is here as crypto whales have gobbled up nearly $16.8 billion worth of BTC since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot market BTC ETFs earlier this year.










 “For years, the crypto industry has been rallying around the message of ‘institutions are coming.’ Following the launch of the spot BTC ETFs on the New York stock exchange, it is quite evident that institutions have arrived.”
According to the analytics platform, the amount of BTC held by whales is back to the levels before the crypto exchange FTX collapsed. However, IntoTheBlock says that this time around, traditional finance firms have stepped into the role that crypto asset managers held.
 “The amount of Bitcoin held by addresses with over 1,000 BTC (‘whales’) has increased by 250,000 BTC since the launch of the ETFs. 
The aggregate amount of Bitcoin held by whale addresses in aggregate is now back near the levels it was prior to the FTX collapse. However, the type of entities within this category has changed drastically – previous industry giants like Genesis, FTX and 3AC (Three Arrows Capital) got wiped out during the 2022 bear market. 
Now traditional finance entities have stepped in and accumulated sizable amounts of Bitcoin since then. Many anticipated hedge funds would buy Bitcoin ETFs, and this week it was revealed that was indeed the case, with institutions like Millenium Management buying as much as $2 billion.” 
The crypto king is trading for $66,635 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

WIF Price Rise: Investor Optimism or Precursor to a Shift?


							

WIF price rises, but trading volume dips



Whale activity boosts sentiment, but technical indicators mixed



Cautious market outlook due to conflicting signals




The cryptocurrency market experienced activity in the past 24 hours, with Dogwifhat (WIF) surging more than 3.5% to $2.70. The token reached intraday highs of $2.72 and lows of $2.44. However, trading volume for WIF has dropped by 38.26%, reaching $536.5 million. This decline suggests a potential shift in market sentiment in the coming hours.



Investor optimism has been boosted by recent whale activity involving WIF. According to on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, a large investor made significant purchases of the token. This investor opened a new wallet and transferred 1.83 million USDC from Coinbase to facilitate the WIF purchases. They have used approximately 606,000 USDC to acquire 227,896 WIF tokens at an average price of $2.66 each.







Data from Coinglass shows that Open Interest (OI) for WIF derivatives has declined by 3.77%, totaling $327.40 million. This decrease in OI suggests a reduction in the number of open contracts, indicating lower trader participation.



Technical analysis for the past 24 hours reveals that the WIF token price is consolidating. The Alligator indicator’s three lines are intertwined, suggesting a lack of strong directional momentum. This indicates a period of equilibrium where buyers and sellers are balanced, leading to stable price movements.







WIF/USD 24-hour price chart source: TradingView



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 45.78, hovering near the midline of 50. This signifies a neutral market without strong bullish or bearish dominance. This level of RSI suggests a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a clear advantage.









The 4-hour technical analysis presents intriguing movements for the WIF token price, as reflected by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. The MACD line is approaching a potential crossover above the signal line, hinting at a possible increase in bullish momentum. This positive divergence suggests that buyers are gradually gaining strength, potentially leading to a near-term price increase.







WIF/USD 4-hour price chart source: TradingView



Furthermore, the Keltner Channels, which measure volatility and price trends, show the price of WIF hovering near the middle of the channel. This suggests a balanced market condition without significant bullish or bearish bias.To conclude, while WIF’s price has increased, the mixed signals from trading volume and technical indicators suggest a cautious market outlook.

Purported Pump.Fun Hacker Claims To Be In Hospital After Arrest and Release - The Defiant

A former Pump.fun employee was arrested and released on bail in relation to a recent hack that stole $1.9M from the platform.A Twitter user has claimed responsibility for the May 16 exploit that stole $1.9 million from Pump.fun, the surging memecoin launchpad.On May 18, JarrettDunn, an X (formerly Twitter) account, tweeted they had spent a night in custody after being arrested by United Kingdom police in connection to last week’s exploit that resulted in roughly $1.9 million worth of SOL being stolen from Pump.fun.Dunn identified themselves as a disgruntled former employee of Pump.fun, arguing that the platform is operating in violation of U.K. law. Dunn also claimed that Pump.fun is planning to distribute an airdrop worth $80 million to early users.“I spent overnight in custody as the pump team alleges I stole 2m of their Ill gotten gains with conspiracy to steal another 80m,” Dunn tweeted. “When I return to the station after my bail I will argue with the crown that Pump is guilty of far more heinous shit. Do you believe they are more guilty of the uk equivalent of running an unregistered securities exchange, or a gambling site with no license, kyc, or aml?”On May 16, a different Twitter user also claiming to be Dunn appeared to claim responsibility for the attack.The bizarre tweets come after Pump.fun published a May 17 post-mortem attributing the attack to a “former employee.” The platform also tweeted that it was cooperating with law enforcement on the day of the hack.The incident follows Pump.fun enjoying meteoric growth since launching in January. On May 10, Pump.fun ranked as top DeFi protocol by weekly revenue with $3.3 million.Pump.fun did not respond to The Defiant’s request to comment at press time.Unhinged accusationsIn his May 18 tweet storm, Dunn also accused Pump.fun of exploiting overseas employees and planning to integrate live-streamed pornography onto the platform.However, despite trying to position himself as a martyr willing to take on his former “horrible bosses,” Dunn’s thread garnered criticism in the comments section.“I’m not a lawyer, and I’m not your lawyer, but I’m going to tell you for free that this isn’t going to work out for you the way you think it is,” said Functi0nZer0, the creator of Wildcat Protocol.“You are not a hero, you are a felon,” added SoldanoCap.On the following day, Dunn claimed he had been taken into hospital after his “mental health was taken into question.”

Dogecoin (DOGE) falls to $0.15: price predictions for the crypto

The crypto Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently dropped to $0.15, what are the future price predictions? The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.1522, marking a decrease of 1.77% in the last 24 hours. 
Let’s see below all the details. 

What factors could influence the price of the crypto Dogecoin (DOGE)?
As anticipated, currently Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at 0.1522 dollars, registering a decrease of 1.77% in the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of 819 million dollars in the same period. 
Ranked 9th on CoinMarketCap, Dogecoin has a market capitalization of 22 billion dollars and a circulating supply of 144 billion DOGE coins.
But what are now the next potential targets for DOGE as it hovers around the $0.15 level? In the four-hour chart, DOGE has a pivot point at $0.15100, indicating a possible bullish forecast for the price of Dogecoin.
Immediate resistance is located at $0.15950, followed by $0.16980 and $0.18440. On the contrary, immediate support is at $0.14270, with further support levels at $0.13240 and $0.12030. 
The relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 53, indicating neutral conditions. The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is positioned at $0.15130, suggesting that the market maintains a bullish trend above that level.
Dogecoin has developed a symmetrical triangle pattern, with significant resistance around $0.1545. At the same time, support persists around $0.1513, reinforced by the 50-day EMA.
Analysis of current trend and possible developments
The current market price above the 50 EMA indicates a bullish trend, but Dogecoin must surpass the resistance at $0.1595 to confirm further gains. The RSI, above 50, suggests a buying trend, supporting this outlook.
If Dogecoin maintains its position above the pivot point at $0.15100, it could push prices higher towards the resistances at $0.15950, $0.16980, and $0.18440. 
However, a break below that level could cause a bearish trend, bringing the price to supports at $0.14270, $0.13240 and $0.12030. The market’s reaction at these levels will be crucial for the future direction of Dogecoin.
In conclusion, the technical outlook for Dogecoin remains bullish above the pivot point at $0.15100. The immediate resistance at $0.15950 will be the first hurdle to overcome, followed by $0.16980 and $0.18440. 
However, caution is needed if the price were to drop below the pivot point. The 50-day EMA at $0.15130 provides a solid foundation for the upward trend currently in place.
Billy Markus of Dogecoin speaks out on X in defense of Elon Musk
The founder of Dogecoin, Billy Markus, recently shared a post on X in which he defended Elon Musk regarding the discrepancies discovered by users in the “freedom of speech” social media app.
According to Markus, the boosting and depowering of accounts are becoming a trend on X. However, he does not attribute these actions to Musk, but rather to the fluctuations of the algorithm.
Markus emphasized that if smaller accounts are empowered, this means that larger accounts are disempowered, a basic mathematical concept. 
He also denied that the algorithm depowers people for specific political opinions or conspiracy theories. Musk’s acquisition of X has brought several challenges for users, including issues related to bots and cryptographic scams.
In response, Musk announced a total purge of the system and the introduction of a small fee for new users to combat bot attacks.
Musk criticized traditional bot detection tools, such as CAPTCHA, calling them obsolete, and suggested that he could make changes to the bot algorithm to improve user visibility on X.

Another Chinese money laundering scheme tied to Deltec and Tether


Daren Li and Yicheng Zhang, two Chinese nationals, have been charged with utilizing tether and crypto-friendly bank Deltec to commit money laundering and wire fraud amounting to $73 million, according to an announcement on Friday by the Department of Justice (DoJ).
According to an affidavit, the pair, who were arrested in Los Angeles and Atlanta in April, worked with pig butchering and scam operations to move assets through “money couriers, financial transactions with no legitimate commercial purpose, and shell accounts.”
Specifically, Li and Zhang used a shell company called CMD Export and Import to transfer cash to crypto-friendly Bahamas-based Deltec Bank and Trust. It was then converted to USDT before being sent to Binance.US or Binance and distributed to money mules as necessary.
Li and Zhang gained citizenship of St. Kitts and Nevis (a small Caribbean Island that partially relies on citizenship by investment for its GDP). As verified by previous Protos reporting, crypto billionaire Justin Sun has St. Kitts and Nevis citizenship that he uses to incorporate in Hong Kong.

While it’s stated in the DoJ press release that a wallet involved had received $341 million in virtual assets, it’s unclear if that’s an exchange hot wallet, a mixing service, or a wallet for the scam itself.
While many of the addresses associated with the scam have been seized or otherwise frozen, many remain active and operational. Protos will update this article if anything else is divulged.

To defend against these attacks, Heroes can call on blocking or shielding moves—or even Taunt the opposing Party to direct all their attacks at one Hero.All these attacks and defenses can be further bolstered by your Heroes’ equipment, with weapons and armor conferring different advantages and disadvantages. Items can be further customized by Engraving them in the Forge.By combining Heroes with complementary abilities and equipment, players can assemble a Party that can take on all-comers.After each battle, you’ll receive Battle Points, which rank your progress through each of the game’s Seasons, and are reset at the end of each Season.You’ll also receive rewards based on your Heroes’ performance in battle, including the Blessings and Fragments needed to summon new Heroes in the Temple, and recipes and components used to craft Equipment.Crafting and EngravingThe Forge screen is where you can craft new Equipment and customize existing weapons and armor by Engraving them.To Craft a new item, head to the Crafting page, and select a Recipe from your available pool. Each item will require one or more Heroes to Craft it, and will draw on your pool of Materials. These include resources such as Metal, Gems, Crystal, Leather and Wood.Each Hero contributes Item Power (IP) to the Crafting process, which stacks and determines the Item Power of the crafted item. The higher the item’s IP, the higher the min-max bracket within which its stats are randomly determined.New equipment can be Crafted, while existing kit can be Engraved to add new aspects. Image: Chain of AllianceIf a Hero has achieved Mastery with an item through leveling up, they gain an IP bonus when crafting—and when crafting rare items using Uncommon materials, they also gain access to that item’s Mastery Aspect.Resources come in Common and Uncommon variants, which can, in turn, be used to craft Common and Uncommon items. When Crafted, Uncommon items generate random Aspects alongside their base stats, which can enable them to inflict or defend against special damage types. For example, the Volt Fury aspect increases Lightning damage, while the Protective Bubble aspect grants the user a shield and extra vitality when their health drops to 35%.Engraving, meanwhile, enables you to increase the IP of your items, and also add Runes to them—changing their Aspects to suit your play style. Runes are dropped as part of the rewards for victory in battle.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

MS Upgrades Micron Technology Stock, Raises PT to $130 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



In a significant move, Morgan Stanley has (NYSE: MS) upgraded its rating for Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) stock from “Underweight” to “Equalweight” and substantially increased its price target from $98 to $130, an increase of over 32%.



This upgrade is in sync with the company’s current market dynamics, particularly the influence of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on buyer sentiment and pricing strength in the memory sector.



Analysts at Morgan Stanley predict that Micron could announce positive financial results this quarter, driven by the ongoing ramp-up phase of HBM supply. Furthermore, the firm expresses growing optimism about the NAND flash memory market, which could potentially drive Micron’s growth in the coming year due to tighter market conditions.



Micron Technology Stock Up 97% Over 1 Year



As of the close on May 17, 2024, Micron Technology’s stock price stood at $125.29, with a market capitalization of $138.74 billion.



The stock has shown impressive returns over various periods, with a year-to-date return of 46.95%, a 1-year return of 97.75%, a 3-year return of 60.06%, and a 5-year return of 241.92%. However, the company currently has a negative profit margin of -20.57% and negative returns on assets (-3.77%) and equity (-8.27%) on a trailing twelve-month basis.



Micron Technology reported revenue of $18.31 billion and a net loss of $3.77 billion over the trailing twelve months. As of the most recent quarter, the company had a total cash of $9.01 billion and a total debt-to-equity ratio of 32.78%. Micron also offers a dividend yield of 0.37%, with an annual dividend of $0.46 per share.





Micron Technology Has Consistently Beaten Expectations in Recent Earnings

This Bitcoin (BTC) Support Level Could Flip to Resistance if Broken


																The weekly recovery of over 7% has pushed bitcoin’s price briefly above $67,500 – a level not seen in almost a month. The world’s leading crypto asset is currently eying to establish a new peak.
With the latest upward price action, BTC has found new support. If flipped, however, this level could also prove to be a major resistance area.
$61.5K: Crucial Level Emerges
The level of $61.5k could potentially serve as strong support for the asset when considering the Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price, a metric that reflects the realized capital of those BTC holders who have held their coins from a day to six months.
This group of investors makes up 53.48% of the total market cap and hence carries a significant weight.
Within this cohort, CryptoQuant identified the 0-day to 1-week Bitcoin STH, capturing 10.6% of the market, closely tracks the spot price, and thus often does not indicate significant variance. Meanwhile, the 1 week to 6 months group, accounts for 47.78% of the market provides a more accurate reflection of short-term trader actions and sentiment.
Notably, the 1-3 month holders who entered during March’s rally now command more than 30% of the realized cap, reflecting a substantial transfer of volume from long-term to short-term holders.
This sensitivity of investors to the STH realized price could lead to $61.5k acting as a pivotal level, as per CryptoQuant’s analysis, which, if breached decisively, may flip from a support to a strong resistance.
New Peak for Bitcoin Soon?
Bitcoin’s price has improved since last week and is currently hovering a little below $67,500 after surpassing this level over the weekend. The level has been deemed noteworthy by 10x Research’s latest newsletter as well, which stated that a break above could lead to new all-time highs.
“Bitcoin’s price action has significantly improved since last week. Prices have rebounded towards their late April resistance zone (67,500), surpassing the early May highs (64,000). A breakthrough above 67,500 could potentially lead to new all-time highs, a scenario that our Bitcoin ETF model predicts.”

Binance calls on small and medium projects to combat low float, high FDV trend

Crypto exchange Binance has called on small and medium-sized projects to combat the low float and high fully diluted valuations (FDV) trend within the crypto space.On May 20, Binance invited small and medium-sized projects to apply for its listing programs. The exchange said that the move to support small and medium projects with sustainable models will help enhance the crypto ecosystem. It wrote: “We hope to enhance the development of the blockchain ecosystem through our support of small and medium-sized projects with strong fundamentals, an organic community base, a sustainable business model, and a dedicated team acting as responsible industry participants.”The move seemingly responds to a trend of projects launching at high market capitalizations while many tokens remain locked. On May 17, Binance Research highlighted that launching with low circulating supplies has become increasingly common in token projects. These projects allocate a large portion of the token supply for future releases. New token launches with limited circulating supplies. Source: Binance ResearchAccording to the report, these tokens experience rapid price appreciation under bullish market conditions. This is attributed to the limited liquidity available during the launch. “However, it is apparent that this kind of price growth is unsustainable when a wave of token supply hits the market upon unlocking,” Binance wrote. Pseudonymous crypto researcher Flow posted on May 17 that in the last six months, 80% of tokens listed on Binance have fallen since their launch. Flow highlighted that most newly launched tokens function as “exit liquidity” for insiders capitalizing on the lack of retail access because of the low initial circulating supply.In May 2024, about $3 billion worth of vested crypto tokens were scheduled to be unlocked. Projects like Sui and Pyth Network are expected to unlock over $1 billion in crypto tokens allocated to various crypto holders, such as early investors. Related: Safe token drops 42% after enabling transfersCiting Token Unlocks and CoinMarketCap data, Binance estimated that about $155 billion in tokens will be unlocked from 2024 to 2030. Estimated value to be unlocked in the future.

Institutional Investors Turned to Bitcoin (BTC) and These Three Altcoins After the CPI Data! They Invested Million Dollars! - Bitcoin Sistemi

As Bitcoin moves between $66,000-$67,000, this week investors are focused on the SEC's decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications.
At this point, while the market was generally dominated by the expectation of rejection, Coinshares published its weekly cryptocurrency report.


Stating that there was an inflow of 932 million dollars in cryptocurrency investment products last week, Coinshares said that these inflows corresponded to the interest rate cut expectation and positive CPI data.

“A total of $932 million was seen in inflows into cryptocurrency investment products in the second week.
The entries were an immediate response to the CPI report; The last 3 trading days of the week accounted for 89% of total flows.
“Grayscale, which has experienced $16.6 billion in outflows since its ETF launch in January, also saw small inflows for the first time.”

Ethereum (ETH) Continues to Show a Downtrend!
When looking at crypto funds individually, it was seen that the majority of fund inflows were in Bitcoin.





While BTC experienced an inflow of $942 million, the largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH) continued to outflow and experienced an outflow of $23.3 million.
The short BTC fund indexed to Bitcoin's decline saw an inflow of $0.6 million.


When we look at other altcoins, Chainlink (LINK) experienced an inflow of $ 3.7 million, Cardano (ADA) $ 1.9 million and Solana (SOL) $ 4.9 million.

“Bitcoin saw inflows of $942 million, indicating a positive outlook among investors.
A wide variety of altcoins have seen inflow; the most notable of which were Solana, Chainlink, and Cardano, which saw $4.9 million, $3.7 million, and $1.9 million, respectively.
“Ether continues to trend lower as it saw $23 million in outflows this week due to the possibility of a spot-based ETF being rejected by the SEC.”

When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, it was seen that the USA ranked first with an inflow of 1 billion dollars.





After the USA, Switzerland ranked second with 27.1 million dollars.
Against these inflows, Hong Kong received 82.5 million dollars; Kamada, on the other hand, experienced an outflow of 16.7 million dollars.

Crypto Market Cools: Bitcoin Steady, Altcoins Diverge


							

Crypto market calms, Bitcoin holds gains.



Altcoins mixed: some lag, others soar.



Analysts see potential for continued rise.




The cryptocurrency market has exhibited less dramatic price fluctuations in recent days, compared to the more volatile weeks that came before. For example, Bitcoin experienced a modest decline of 0.68% over the past 24 hours. Similar downturns have been observed in leading altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and BNB.



Taking a broader view, cryptocurrencies are still holding onto some of their weekly gains. Notably, Bitcoin traded around $61,000 last week before appreciating to the $67,000 range.



It’s important to note that Bitcoin achieved the $67,000 level without sharp price movements. While Bitcoin did experience occasional price dips throughout the week, it has managed to retain its recent gains. Overall, Bitcoin is still up over 8% for the week.



While Bitcoin has steadily climbed, some altcoins have not followed its upward trajectory. For instance, BNB, XRP, and TRON have all seen declines in their weekly performance.



On the other hand, prominent altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Chainlink (LINK) have capitalized on Bitcoin’s less volatile movement to achieve growth exceeding 20%.



Commenting on the current market trends, prominent market analyst Michaël van de Poppe highlighted the recent decrease in volatility. He suggested that the witnessed in recent months may not be the immediate future. Van de Poppe believes Bitcoin may continue its gradual ascent to reclaim other lost ground.







Another analyst, Ali Martinez, previously suggested that Bitcoin could potentially rise towards $76,610 if it managed to reclaim support at $64,000. Bitcoin not only regained this key level, but also surged to $67,500, suggesting a potentially upward trajectory for the crypto market.



Echoing a similar sentiment, Van de Poppe suggested in a recent commentary that altcoins may have completed their price corrections. He anticipates a gradual but steady rise for altcoins in the coming months, potentially outperforming Bitcoin during periods of lower volatility.









The bottom line is that the cryptocurrency market has entered a period of relative calm, with Bitcoin exhibiting modest price swings while holding onto weekly gains. While some altcoins have lagged behind, others have capitalized on Bitcoin’s stability to achieve significant growth.  Prominent analysts remain optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin could continue its ascent and altcoins might even outperform the leading cryptocurrency in the coming months as volatility subsides.

Will Bitcoin, the ninth largest asset, become number 1?


                                Bitcoin's Climb: How Close to the Top?                                The Cryptocurrency Market is currently one of the world's most popular Markets, largely due to the leading Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Bitcoin has not only provided users with significant profits since its inception but has also achieved an all-time high of around $73,737 in March 2024, trading at approximately $67,103 at present. With a market capitalization of about $1.31 trillion, Bitcoin ranks ninth on the list of the world's largest assets. Ahead of BTC in the list are Gold, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Google (GOOG), Saudi Aramco (2222.SR), Amazon (AMZN), and Silver. Silver, holding the eighth position, has a Market Cap of $1.83 trillion. It is speculated that BTC will easily surpass Silver to become the eighth largest asset in the coming days by adding $500 billion to its market cap. According to experts, if BTC reaches a price of $93,000, it will surpass Silver in market cap.Coin Gabbar thinks BTC needs to go up by 40% to beat Silver in market value, which seems doable now. Bitcoin recently had its Halving Event, making its prices shoot up fast. This happened because the rewards for mining new Bitcoins got cut in half, which means fewer Bitcoins will be made, and their prices might go up. People are saying BTC could hit $100,000 soon. Big owners of cryptocurrency websites even say it might happen by the end of 2024.Will Bitcoin reach the first position as the ninth largest asset?Bitcoin, with a market cap of around $1.31 trillion, currently ranks as the ninth largest asset globally, while Gold holds the top spot with a market cap of nearly $16 trillion. To reach the first position, Bitcoin's price would need to increase by roughly 13 times, which seems challenging given the market's unpredictability. However, Bitcoin has demonstrated impressive performance over the years, growing by 98896.4% in the past 11 years. Although Gold is trusted by many due to its historical significance, Bitcoin has gained popularity but hasn't reached Gold's level of recognition yet. While Bitcoin's price may continue to rise, it might take 2 to 3 years for Bitcoin to surpass Gold in market cap. Looking long-term, Bitcoin has the potential to become the world's largest asset in the next 5 to 10 years.Also Read:- Blockchain Gaming Investment Hit $1 Billion In April

BTC, ETH Little Changed Ahead of Ether ETF Decision

Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were little changed, suggesting a consolidation after last week's rally. BTC traded at around $67,000 while ETH held steady about $3,100. The wider digital asset market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has added 0.3% in the last 24 hours. This week, attention will turn to the SEC's decision on the approval of ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with the deadline for a response to VanEck's and Ark/21 Shares' applications due on May 23 and May 24, respectively. Traders may be keeping their powder dry until then.

Why Are Many Altcoins Down Bad? It's Not Because Of Meme Coins, VC Points Out - Benzinga

A new article by Haseeb Qureshi, Managing Partner at Dragonfly, challenges popular narratives surrounding the recent slump in altcoin prices.What Happened: Qureshi’s article challenged three prevalent theories regarding the underperformance of these altcoins: venture capitalists (VCs) and key opinion leaders (KOLs) dumping tokens, retail investors switching to meme coins and low circulating supply hindering price discovery.Qureshi presented data that shows a significant decline in recent Binance-listed tokens, excluding explicit meme coins and tokens with prior token generation events (TGEs). He used this data to refute the first theory that VCs and KOLs are dumping tokens on retail investors. "Every top tier VC that comes to your mind has at least a 1 year cliff and a multiyear vest before they get their tokens," Qureshi stated, pointing out that these VCs are still locked, making the dumping theory implausible.He then tackled the second theory, which suggests that retail investors are abandoning these tokens in favor of meme coins. By comparing trading volumes of these altcoins and meme coins like Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, Qureshi demonstrated that the timeline does not align. "Memecoin mania was a full on frenzy by March, but the basket dumped in April, a month and a half later," he notes, arguing that this disconnect disproves the theory of a retail exodus to meme coins.The third theory posits that the low circulating supply of these tokens prevents meaningful price discovery. Qureshi acknowledged that while low float can be problematic, it is not unique to the current market cycle.Also Read: ‘The Dogecoin Explosion Made Something Click In Me:’ Veteran Trader Shares Secrets To Turning Pennies Into Millions With Meme CoinsHe provided historical data showing similar circulating supplies in previous cycles and noted, "If this theory were correct, you should see the coins with the lowest floats getting punished, and higher floats should be doing OK. But we don't see a strong correlation."Qureshi concluded that these popular theories fail to explain the underperformance of these altcoins.Instead, he attributed the downturn to external market factors, particularly geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which affected market sentiment in mid-April. "The market decided they didn't want to buy them back," he points out, suggesting that the broader market environment, rather than specific market structure issues, is to blame.Looking ahead, Qureshi advised VCs to exhibit price discipline, exchanges to list tokens at lower prices with better lockup terms, and project teams to increase token supply on day one to enhance price stability. He reassured projects currently experiencing price drops, citing historical precedents where now-successful projects initially faced similar declines. "Stay focused on building something worth being proud of and keep shipping. Markets will figure it out eventually," he encourages.What’s Next: For those interested in further discussions on digital assets and their market dynamics, the Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 promises to be an insightful platform.Read Next: Retail Trading Legend Roaring Kitty Returns After Three Years—Can He Spark Another Frenzy?

Crypto Heist or Revenge Story? Ex-Employee Arrested in $1.9M Case


							

Ex-employee arrested in $1.9M crypto exploit.



Blames platform, claims innocence.



Legal case ongoing, restrictions imposed.




Jarett Dunn, a former employee of the Solana-based memecoin launchpad pump.fun, has publicly disclosed his recent arrest by London Police in connection with an alleged $1.9 million exploit at the platform. Dunn, who uses the online aliases “staccoverflow” and “freestac,” detailed his arrest and subsequent release on bail in a series of social media posts.







Following the theft of $1.9 million in funds, pump.fun accused its former employee as responsible for the exploit, claiming that he misappropriated nearly 12,300 SOL using his privileged position.



Through his online posts, Dunn explained his arrest and its aftermath, stating that he was hospitalized following the incident. He further claimed, “Authorities detained me on suspicion of stealing $2 million of what pump.fun alleges are ill-gotten gains, with plans to steal an additional $80 million.”







Dunn also stated that he would be required to attend a police interview due to his mental state, which he claims has deteriorated significantly. He urged investors to withdraw their funds from pump.fun, alleging that the platform misrepresents its Total Value Locked (TVL) as legitimate funds. Additionally, he encouraged UK citizens to file legal complaints against the company.









A private investigation firm, The Rollup, has provided updates on the case following a thorough examination of Dunn’s situation. According to their findings, Dunn was released on bail by UK police and is required to return in August. He is reportedly subject to restrictions on communication with certain individuals. 



While the circumstances surrounding the alleged $1.9 million exploit at pump.fun remain murky. Jarett Dunn, who faces accusations and legal proceedings, his claims of innocence and allegations against the platform raise questions about the incident’s true nature.

How Does Crypto Work? | Cryptopolitan

Cryptocurrency is a digital revolution that has completely changed how we think about money.This guide dives into the basics, answering questions such as “how does crypto work?” We’ll also explore crypto’s rise and impact on the economy and daily transactions. Read on!Introduction to Cryptocurrency: The Digital Money RevolutionCryptocurrency is digital money that uses encryption to secure transactions. This means it’s safe and private. You can send cryptocurrency directly to someone else without needing to go to banks.Think of it as digital cash that lives on the internet.The Historical Context and the Rise of Digital CurrenciesDigital currencies emerged as a response to the 2008 financial crisis, where people wanted a financial system that wouldn’t be under the control of banks and governments. However, it’s impossible to talk about crypto without referring to Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper. This new form of money would use blockchain technology for secure, transparent transactions. Over time, more digital currencies appeared, like Ethereum and Ripple, each offering unique features. The rise of these currencies has sparked a global discussion about the future of money. Today, they are part of investment portfolios and are slowly being accepted for everyday transactions.The Backbone of Cryptocurrency: Blockchain TechnologyBlockchain technology is the foundation of cryptocurrency. It is a digital ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. This technology ensures security and transparency because it is decentralized. No single entity controls the blockchain, making it resistant to fraud and tampering.Every transaction made with cryptocurrency is recorded as a “block” of data. These blocks are linked together in chronological order, creating a continuous chain. Each block is visible to all users but secured by cryptography, meaning that once a transaction is added, it cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus from the network majority.Blockchain’s potential goes beyond cryptocurrency. It is being explored for various applications, such as supply chain management, voting systems, and secure sharing of medical records. Its ability to provide a secure and transparent environment makes it a revolutionary technology in our digital age.The Significance of Decentralization in CryptoOne of cryptocurrency’s biggest features is its decentralized nature. In the finance industry, decentralization is completely revolutionary, changing how investors access funds and the availability of various financial instruments.All of a sudden, people don’t need central banks to access capital or trade anymore. This new crypto ecosystem powered by blockchain technology is significant, as it opens up finance to a broader range of individuals than traditional finance.With the global market cap for crypto topping $2 trillion at the time of writing this article, the opportunities remain endless for the space.Creating Digital Wealth: How Cryptocurrencies are Mined and ManagedBitcoin mining is a complex process that involves computational power and technological finesse. Its goal is to verify transactions within the Bitcoin network, which is the underlying function that makes the Bitcoin blockchain run without any interference from a centralized financial institution.People who participate in this process are called miners, and they receive compensation in Bitcoin for the resources they expend.The nomenclature “mining” draws parallels with the extraction of natural resources, as the availability of Bitcoins is finite, capped at 21 million. Like traditional mining, Bitcoin mining necessitates an investment of energy. This time, it takes the form of electrical power. Bitcoin mining is a highly competitive activity, as the race is perpetually on for the first miner to solve the computational puzzles or hash needed to validate the next block on the network.Notably, this puzzle-solving is executed solely by computers. Consequently, the computational power of a miner’s setup directly influences their capacity to make guesses per second, thus heightening their prospects of emerging victorious in the mining race.Bitcoin mining serves several primary objectives:Introducing new coins into circulation while concurrently validating ongoing transactions.Safeguarding against counterfeiting and double-spending.Upholding ledger integrity in a decentralized manner.Understanding Crypto Wallets: Hot vs. Cold Storage SolutionsA crypto digital wallet is essential for managing cryptocurrencies, and they come in two main types: hot and cold storage. A hot digital wallet is connected to the internet, making it convenient for frequent transactions. They’re software-based and accessible through devices like smartphones or computers. However, their online nature makes them more vulnerable to cyberattacks.Cold digital wallets, on the other hand, are offline storage solutions. They are often hardware-based, like USB devices, or can even be paper with printed keys. This detachment from the internet shields them from hacking and online threats, providing a high security level. This makes them ideal for long-term storage of large crypto amounts due to their enhanced security features.The Diverse World of CryptocurrencyHere’s an overview of the diverse world of crypto, and some of the popular tokens trending on the market today:Leading Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and MoreIn the world of crypto, there are two main kinds of tokens: Bitcoin and altcoins. Bitcoin occupies an exalted role in the industry due to its status as the premier cryptocurrency, which is reflected in its tremendously high valuation today.However, despite its status as a widely accepted unit of exchange, Bitcoin has limited use cases. Enter Ethereum, one of the most unique crypto platforms. Ethereum is a blockchain platform known for its versatility. Beyond handling digital currency, it supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).Launched in 2015, Ethereum introduces programmability into the blockchain world, allowing developers to create varied applications. Its native cryptocurrency, Ether, powers transactions and operations within the network. Not all cryptocurrencies work the same way. Tether’s idea is to maintain a stable value always. It’s pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar, with each Tether theoretically backed by one dollar held in reserve. Its stability makes it a favored choice for traders seeking to avoid the volatility typical of other cryptocurrencies.Other popular cryptocurrencies include BNB, the native token of the Binance Smart Chain, Solana, USDC, and XRP.Exploring Stablecoins: Bridging the Gap Between Crypto and FiatImagine a special kind of crypto money that acts like a bridge between the regular money you know and the digital money world. That’s what stablecoins are! They’re like crypto coins tethered to something steady, like real money (dollars, euros) or even gold. This keeps their value stable, unlike regular crypto that be extremely volatile.Stablecoins are handy because they let you enjoy regular crypto benefits like fast transfers and security, without the wild price swings.This is why they’re widely accepted as a means of exchange, similar to Bitcoin. Investing in Cryptocurrency: Risks and RewardsInvesting in cryptocurrencies comes with both risks and rewards, and understanding them is crucial for anyone diving into this market. Despite these risks, the rewards can be enticing, as there’s the opportunity for decentralization, anonymity, and the potential for substantial profits. Navigating the Risks: Security, Volatility, and RegulationOne major risk is security. Cryptocurrencies are stored in digital wallets, which can be vulnerable to hacking or phishing attacks. However, losing access to your digital wallet means losing your funds, with little to no chance of recovery. However, the potential rewards can be substantial. Another critical factor affecting crypto investing is volatility, where prices can swing wildly in short periods, leading to substantial gains or losses in a matter of hours. While this volatility presents opportunities for profit, it also heightens the risk of significant losses. Besides, there’s the issue of regulation to contend with. Today, governments worldwide continue to grapple with how to regulate cryptocurrencies, leading to a patchwork of rules and regulations. Such a dynamic landscape can impact the value and legality of cryptocurrencies, affecting investor sentiment and market dynamics.Practical Uses of Cryptocurrency in Today’s WorldCryptocurrency, once considered a niche asset, is now finding practical applications across various industries in today’s world. One of its biggest uses is as a medium of exchange. Cryptocurrency as a Medium of ExchangeToday, many businesses are accepting cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services. From online retailers to local businesses, the adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum provides customers with more payment options and facilitates faster, cheaper cross-border transactions.This has also affected the remittance industry. Migrant workers often face high fees and lengthy processing times when sending money home to their families. Cryptocurrencies offer a cheaper and faster alternative, enabling instant transfers with lower transaction fees compared to traditional remittance services.Blockchain technology, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies, is also being leveraged for various practical applications beyond finance. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, automate and enforce agreements without the need for intermediaries. This technology has applications in areas like supply chain management, real estate transactions, and legal contracts, streamlining processes and reducing costs.Additionally, cryptocurrencies serve as a hedge against inflation and political instability in countries with volatile fiat currencies. Citizens in countries facing economic crises or hyperinflation often turn to cryptocurrencies to preserve their wealth and protect against government interference.Furthermore, cryptocurrencies are empowering individuals in developing countries with limited access to traditional banking services. Through mobile devices, people can access financial services like savings, loans, and remittances using cryptocurrencies, bypassing the need for traditional banks.The Legal and Financial Landscape of CryptocurrencyWhile regulations vary by jurisdiction, most countries require individuals to report cryptocurrency transactions for tax purposes. This includes buying, selling, trading, and receiving cryptocurrencies as income.The taxation of cryptocurrencies often depends on how they are used. For instance, capital gains tax typically applies to profits made from selling cryptocurrencies, while income tax may apply to mining rewards or payments received in cryptocurrency.Furthermore, the lack of clear guidance in some jurisdictions has led to uncertainty regarding tax obligations related to cryptocurrencies. However, tax authorities are becoming more focused on enforcing compliance, and failure to report cryptocurrency transactions accurately can result in penalties or legal consequences.The Debate: Are Cryptocurrencies Financial Securities?The debate over whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as financial securities remains a big one. For instance, per SEC regulations, should a cryptocurrency satisfy the conditions for being deemed an investment contract, it becomes mandatory for the SEC to ensure its registration as an investment. Thus, it becomes subject to SEC oversight. However, when crypto is offered to institutional investors, it assumes the classification of an investment contract, and thus has to be classified as such.In future, clarifying the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities could have significant implications for their regulation, taxation, and use in the financial markets.Safeguarding Your Investment: Preventing Fraud and ScamsWhile it’s important to focus on making the right trading decisions and making more profits than losses, it’s even more essential to take the right steps to protect against fraud and scams.Recognizing and Avoiding Cryptocurrency ScamsCryptocurrency scams lurk around every corner, but staying vigilant can protect your hard-earned cash.The first step to avoiding these scams and protecting yourself from malicious pretenders is to recognize them from afar.One of the most common ways through which you may lose your funds is through a phishing scam. Here, malicious elements set up entirely false websites, and redirect you to pages with keylogging capacities.Often, you may be asked to provide sensitive details, such as your private keys. However, you should give away your private keys, which control your crypto, as legitimate platforms won’t ask for them.Also, if someone promises you’ll get rich quick with crypto, it’s a scam. Real investments come with risk, so if it seems too easy to be true, it’s most likely false.Also, don’t be rushed. Scammers want you to act fast before you do research. This also extends to social media, where you should always be wary of social media ads or unsolicited calls promoting crypto schemes.Best Practices for Secure Cryptocurrency InvestmentTo secure your crypto investments, it’s important to carry out thorough research into the project’s background, team, and white paper. Also, stick to only reputable crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance with strong security measures. Finally, if an online romance involves crypto investment advice, it’s likely a scam, so avoid mixing love with finance.How to Get Started with CryptocurrenciesIf you’re serious about breaking through with cryptocurrency investments, the first stage is to choose the marketplace where you’ll purchase crypto.Choosing a Crypto Exchange: Factors to ConsiderHere are some of the most essential factors to consider when choosing cryptocurrency exchanges:Security: Look out for platforms with two-factor authentication, cold storage for offline funds, and a proven track record of keeping user assets safe.Regulation: Opt for exchanges compliant with local regulations. This adds a layer of security and consumer protection. Fees: Transaction fees can eat into your profits. So, compare trading fees, deposit/withdrawal fees, and any hidden costs.User Experience: A user-friendly interface is essential, especially if you’re a new investor. Some of the features to assess include ease of navigation, buying/selling process, and access to educational resources.Supported Cryptocurrencies: There’s no point option for cryptocurrency exchanges if they don’t support the crypto you want to trade, so make sure the exchange offers the cryptos you’re interested in buying and trading. Buying Your First Cryptocurrency: Step-by-Step GuideNow that you understand the implications and have digested the safety tips, it’s time to get right into how to purchase your first crypto tokens.Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you navigate:Step 1: Choose Your ExchangeThe first step is to research reputable exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. Consider factors like security, regulation, fees, and ease of use. For instance, if you’re a new user, you might want to opt for Binance because of its intuitive interface. However, a seasoned investor who needs advanced trading tools might find Coinbase more appealing.Whichever option you go for, don’t forget to ensure that it suits your trading needs.Step 2: Create an AccountAfter choosing a platform, the next step is to create an account. It’s important to note that you’ll have to supply basic information and verification documents where required.Reputable centralized exchange platforms have KYC and AML requirements to fulfill, which they do by requesting that customers provide certain levels of ID in order to access the platform.Some of the information that you may be required to provide include:Full nameDate of birthPicture of your faceUtility bill showing your addressTravel PassportWith most cryptocurrency exchanges, there are various membership tiers that provide different levels of access based on how much information you provide.After submitting the required credentials, you may be required to wait between a few hours and a week for them to be verified.Step 3: Fund Your AccountMost platforms allow deposits via bank transfer, debit card, or wire transfer. Choose your preferred method and purchase crypto with fiat. Note that different platforms may have deposit fees, so ensure to check the website or contact support to understand the requirements in this regard.Step 4: Select Your CryptocurrencyAfter funding your account, you’re now ready to purchase crypto! One significant difference between traditional finance and crypto investing is that the entry barrier is rather low.With many crypto exchanges, you can purchase crypto worth only a dollar. Regardless, there are several tokens to choose from. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are popular starting points due to their established presence.Step 5: Placing Your OrderExchanges offer different order types. For a simple purchase, use a “Market Order,” which buys at the current market price. There are two main order options- market orders and limit orders. The former executes your purchase immediately at the best available market price, while the former sets a specific price at which you want to buy. The order is only fulfilled if the price reaches that point.Step 6: Review and ConfirmThe next step is to double-check the amount of cryptocurrency you’re buying and the total cost, including any fees. Once satisfied, confirm the order.The Future of Cryptocurrency: Trends and PredictionsThe crypto market is known for its ups and downs, but some trends and predictions are worth noting. For one, big players like banks and financial institutions are showing growing interest in crypto, potentially leading to increased stability and legitimacy.Also, DeFi technology and NFTs are on the rise, allows for financial transactions without traditional intermediaries, and representing ownership of digital assets like art and collectibles respectively.With regards to price predictions, some predict Bitcoin reaching $77,000 in the next few years, fueled by factors like spot ETF approval and the halving event. Also, transforming real-world assets (like stocks) into digital tokens on blockchains could be a multi-trillion dollar market in the coming years.Wrapping UpThe most important thing to note about the crypto market is that it’s highly volatile. This, more than anything, is why it’s so essential to carry out your own research before investing.Despite recent breakthroughs, it should be noted that the blockchain industry is still in its early stages, and there’s much more development to come.As such, investors and crypto enthusiasts should endeavor to stay abreast of these developments, equipping themselves with the right knowledge to stay afloat amid the wild swings of market volatility.

Grayscale switches CEO following $144 million reduction in fees as Bitcoin outflows finally subsiding

Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest crypto asset manager, announced the appointment of Peter Mintzberg as its new Chief Executive Officer, effective August 15, 2024. Mintzberg will succeed Michael Sonnenshein, who stepped down from the position after a decade with the firm to pursue other interests.During his tenure as CEO, Sonnenshein guided Grayscale from $60 million to approximately $30 billion in assets under management. Notably, Sonnenshein oversaw Grayscale’s historic court victory against the Securities and Exchange Commission, which enabled the firm to uplist the first spot Bitcoin ETF to NYSE Arca.Sonnensheinn led Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to acquire 624,000 BTC before shepherding it through its transition to a spot Bitcoin ETF in January this year. As of his resignation today, Grayscale’s Bitcoin has fallen to 290,000 BTC, although its dollar value decline was limited to $9.6 billion due to Bitcoin’s meteoric price surge from $46,000 to $67,000.With a 1.5% management fee on its Bitcoin, this drop equates to a reduction of roughly $144 million per year in fees for Grayscale. However, with its current assets under management of approximately $19.4 billion, current fee estimates come to around $290 million annually. Over the past few weeks, outflows have begun to subside, with some days of positive inflows into the fund.In a series of posts on X, Sonnenshein expressed his gratitude for his time at Grayscale and thanked the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, Barry Silbert, for his partnership over the last ten years. “What we’ve achieved together is nothing short of remarkable,” Sonnenshein wrote, addressing the Grayscale team. Keep building. To the moon 🚀.”Silbert also took to X to announce the leadership change, highlighting Mintzberg’s 20+ years of experience across prominent asset managers, including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, OppenheimerFunds, and Invesco. “Peter is an exceptional strategic leader with global expertise across the most prominent asset managers, which are critical ingredients as we position Grayscale for its next growth phase,” Silbert said in the press release.Mintzberg joins Grayscale when the crypto asset class is at a critical inflection point. “I’ve long admired Grayscale’s position as the leading crypto asset management firm, and I am honored to join the most talented and pioneering team in the business,” Mintzberg said.In recent weeks, Grayscale has seen a reduction in outflows from its GBTC ETFs, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment. As the firm continues to expand its future-forward investment product suite, Mintzberg’s appointment is expected to position Grayscale for its next growth phase.Over the last decade, Grayscale has launched nineteen crypto investment products, enabling access to the crypto asset class in a familiar, transparent wrapper. The firm has also served as an educational resource to the investing public, working with policymakers and regulators to bring digital assets further into the regulatory perimeter while growing its business capabilities and best-in-class team.As Grayscale navigates this leadership transition, Chief Financial Officer Edward McGee will assume the role of principal executive officer in the intervening period, responsible for leading the firm until Mintzberg takes the helm in August.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Why Bitcoin’s bull run is not over yet, according to key signals - AMBCrypto



The Puell Multiple needs to rise at least three times more before Bitcoin can hit the top.
On-chain data, backed by the MVRV difference, indicated that BTC might surpass $85,000.

Bar the recently concluded week, Bitcoin [BTC] found it hard not to produce a red candlestick in a seven-day timeframe since April. As a result of this, there have been opinions suggesting that the bull run is over.
However, that viewpoint could be invalid considering signals AMBCrypto got from different on-chain metrics. First on the list is Bitcoin’s Puell Multiple.
This metric can give insights into BTC’s valuation by looking at miners’ revenue. Using a 365-day moving average, the Puell Multiple tells if the coin is a cycle top or if there is room for the price to appreciate.
It’s bulls over bears again
Historically, Bitcoin hits the roof of the bull market when the multiple rises past a reading of 3 or more. For example, the metric hit a value of 8.13 before the price of BTC started to plunge.
In 2017, the Puell Multiple reached 6.12 before the bull market was declared void. Fast-forward to 2021, the reading had to hit 3.06 before the capitulation process began.
At press time, the metric, according to Glassnode, was 0.90, indicating that BTC’s price has the potential to move higher.
However, one thing AMBCrypto observed was that the reading dropped from the last one every time the next cycle hit its peak.
Source: Glassnode
Therefore, there is a chance the reading might not surpass 3 before Bitcoin calls it quits. At the same time, this does not imply that the predictions targeting $80,000 and above would not come to pass.
$85,000 is almost a sure bet
Another metric supporting this bias is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Long/Short Difference.
The idea behind the MVRV Long/Short Difference is to ascertain the value each Bitcoin holder purchased the coin compared to the current price.
If the metric is at 0%, it means that Bitcoin has hit the end of a bear market. On the other hand, Bitcoin hits the end of a bull market when the metric is almost 100% or above it.
From the chart below, Bitcoin’s bear market ended around the 2nd of March 2023. It was around the same period that this bull cycle started.
In 2013, 2017, and 2021, the MVRV Long/Short Difference reached 130%, 87%, and 69% respectively at the top of the cycle. However, the highest the metric has reached this cycle was 41%.
Source: Santiment
With this trend, BTC’s price could likely trade higher than the peak it hit in March. Going by the difference in the metrics of this cycle and 2021, Bitcoin could hit $85,000.

While the coin can also move higher, the $100,000 prediction being mentioned in many corners might be difficult.
If the price hits the landmark, good for holders. If it does not, it might still sound like a good deal for Bitcoin believers.

Bullish signal: nearly 28,000 BTC left centralized exchanges in 7 days - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Bitcoin (BTC) showed a 6.6% recovery in the last seven days, and investors withdrew their BTC holdings from centralized exchanges as a result, according to data aggregator Coinglass. In the last seven days, 27,975.21 BTC left the 20 exchanges tracked by the data platform, roughly $1.9 billion at the time of writing.Coinbase Pro saw the most outflows, with 15,891.79 BTC leaving the exchange focused on seasoned traders. Binance came in second, with investors withdrawing 7669.64 BTC from the exchange in the past week.Crypto outflows from centralized exchanges are commonly seen as a bullish sign, indicating that investors are not inclined to sell their holdings in the short term, possibly awaiting price growth. The total amount of Bitcoin left in centralized exchanges tracked by Coinglass is 1.72 million BTC, the lowest level of 2024 so far. Bitcoin supply at centralized exchanges. Image: CoinglassDespite the week of Bitcoin outflows, Bithumb saw an increase of 1,612.50 BTC in the same period. Gate.io and OKX also saw positive Bitcoin flows to their platforms, registering 381.25 BTC and 345.04 BTC in deposits, respectively.Meanwhile, the Bitcoin-related crypto investment products registered positive flows for the second consecutive week, with $942 million invested in the last week. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, highlighted that the below-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) result was responsible for this positive change, as the latter three trading days of the week made up 89% of the total flows.Moreover, Bitfinex’s analysts pointed out that new Bitcoin whales accumulated BTC around the $60,000 mark, while long-term holders maintained their positions. The latest edition of the “Bitfinex Alpha” report underscores that this paints a landscape where investors show confidence in BTC’s price.“Even for short-term holders (STH), whose portion of the supply has increased from 19% at the beginning of the year to 26.1% currently has an average cost basis of approximately $61,046, making this an essential level to maintain to avoid triggering sell-offs. This is an important cohort to watch though, as STHs and ETF buyers seem to be quick to sell if prices fall below their acquisition cost.”

Australian Man Pleads Guilty to Promoting BitConnect



                    

An Australian man has admitted his role in promoting cryptocurrency lending services for the now-defunct crypto exchange BitConnect, a notorious entity accused of operating as a Ponzi scheme and defrauding victims of over $2.4 billion before shutting down in 2018.



“Mr. Bigatton provided financial product advice without holding an Australian Financial Services license or authorization to provide financial services about the lending platform,” the Australian Securities and Exchange Commission (ASIC) stated on May 17.




ASIC claimed that John Louis Anthony Bigatton, in his capacity as BitConnect’s national promoter, gave financial product advice on six occasions at different locations across Australia, including four seminars and two social media posts.



“Mr. Bigatton undertook promotional activities for BitConnect and the Lending Platform on social media, at seminars that he hosted at various locations around Australia, and through face-to-face meetings with investors,” ASIC continued.



BitConnect’s lending platform was touted as an investment opportunity, urging investors to purchase BitConnect coin (BCC) through its website. 




Investors could loan BCC for a fixed period in exchange for high interest rates.

Once invested, they had no control over their loans or the ability to withdraw their money until the lending period concluded. 



This structure allegedly allowed the platform to function as a Ponzi scheme, using funds from newer investors to pay returns to earlier investors, as per the United States Internal Revenue Service.




A sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 5.



BitConnect was launched in February 2016, offering a platform and a digital currency, but it ceased operations in January 2018 when its founders disappeared with investors’ money.



In January 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California ordered $17 million in restitution for the fraudulent scheme, providing some relief to victims of the BitConnect investment scam.



A group of victims of the BitConnect fraud scheme found some solace when a court mandated they receive a portion of the $17 million restitution.



The whereabouts of founder Satish Kumbhani remain unknown.

AI predicts Bitcoin price for August 1, 2024


After Bitcoin (BTC) opened the week on a greener note, its price ranging around $67,000 and pulling the rest of the cryptocurrency market up with it, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms envision more bullishness and further advances for the maiden crypto asset in the next few months.
Indeed, Bitcoin has solidified its position above the key support level of $66,000 and then surpassed the next important step at $67,000, triggering confidence and optimism not just in the crypto industry but also from advanced AI forecasting algorithms.
BTC price prediction
Specifically, one of these AI algorithms, which draws on historical BTC trends, technical analysis (TA) indicators, chart patterns, and relevant developments, has projected that Bitcoin could hit the price of $97,264 by August 1, 2024, suggesting an increase of 44.89% from its current values.


3-month BTC price prediction. Source: CoinCodex
Elsewhere, the latest iteration of the OpenAI invention ChatGPT, called GPT-4o, has offered the Bitcoin price prediction for August 1, 2024, with targets between $76,348.50 and $89,108.83, “considering the ongoing market factors and historical trends.”
In the meantime, the recent Anthropic AI model, Claude 3 Opus, is even more optimistic, having provided an estimate for Bitcoin price that suggests it will be trading between $105,072 and $167,808 by August 2024, taking into account Bitcoin post-halving sentiment, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and more.
As it explained:

“The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 has led to significant inflows, with BlackRock’s ETF alone accumulating over 16,000 BTC within days of launch. Continued institutional adoption could drive prices higher.”

BTC price analysis
For now, Bitcoin is changing hands at $67,130, which indicates a 0.11% decline in the last 24 hours, but nonetheless an increase of 6.88% across the previous seven days and an accumulated gain of 4.93% over the past month, according to the most recent charts on May 20.

Meanwhile, renowned crypto trading expert Ali Martinez has observed that traders have transacted over 530,000 BTC at the price of $66,250, making it a crucial support level, which, if holds, could send Bitcoin sky high, as he explained in an X post on May 20.

Earlier, pseudonymous expert TradingShot shared insights according to which Bitcoin could reach a whopping $100,000 sometime after July, based on the analysis of Bitcoin’s TA indicators and prevailing bullish sentiment following a significant correction in early May, as Finbold reported on May 18.

All things considered, Bitcoin might, indeed, follow the path set by some of the popular AI platforms, especially if the market retains positive sentiment around the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, but doing one’s own research is highly important as things in this sector can change overnight.

Solana (SOL) Ready for $200? Enormous Breakthrough Evaluated

Solana has secured a serious breakthrough at $170 and lunged toward $180. With this price recovery, Solana might aim for a $200 price target and reach it in the foreseeable future.The latest price movement has been accompanied by a significant increase in trading volume, indicating strong buying pressure. The surge from $170 to $180 is notable because it overcame a local resistance level, suggesting that bulls are gaining control. This momentum could propel Solana to the much-anticipated $200 mark.A closer look at the chart reveals that Solana has moved above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which are critical indicators of a bullish trend. The recent break above these moving averages is a strong signal of an upward trajectory. Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands are widening, indicating increased volatility and the potential for further price gains.SOL/USDT Chart by TradingViewIn addition to technical indicators, on-chain data supports the bullish outlook for Solana. The number of new addresses on the Solana network has been steadily increasing, reflecting growing interest and adoption. According to Hellomoon, the number of new addresses in May 2024 is ascending, suggesting that more users are joining the network.Moreover, the weekly transaction fee breakdown shows a rise in non-vote (priority) fees, indicating higher network usage and demand for transaction processing. This increase in network activity demonstrates the growing utility of Solana's blockchain.However, while the technical and on-chain metrics are encouraging, the market in general is far from euphoria, and the current state of things suggests that Solana and cryptocurrencies alike are unlikely to reach ATHs. Inflows are still far from even this year's top, not to mention 2021's and 2017's bull runs.

The Secret Weapon for Bitcoin Investors in a Bull Run: Covered Strangle


							

Bitcoin investors offered strategy for yield



Covered strangle boosts returns in bull market



Works best in markets with low volatility




10x Research, a financial firm known for its prescient market predictions, has proposed a strategy for Bitcoin investors seeking to augment their returns in the ongoing bull market. The firm recommends that Bitcoin holders consider implementing a “covered strangle” options strategy alongside their existing spot market holdings.



In essence, the covered strangle strategy involves selling an Out-of-The-Money (OTM) call option – a contract granting the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase Bitcoin at a predetermined price (strike price) above the current market price – and an OTM put option – a contract granting the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell Bitcoin at a strike price below the current market price.



Crucially, this strategy generates additional income for investors through the premiums received for selling both the call and put options.



In a client note released on Monday, Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, outlined his firm’s preferred approach: buying Bitcoin spot, selling a $100,000 strike call, and selling a $50,000 strike put, all with a December 2024 expiry. Thielen explained that selling the call could generate an estimated 11% profit, while the put option could generate an estimated 6% profit.



Moreover, Thielen emphasized that the covered strangle strategy offers investors a two-pronged approach. According to him, the strategy could provide either a 17% downside protection or a 17% increase in potential yield, depending on Bitcoin’s closing price in December.









The covered strangle strategy is typically favored by investors who hold a bullish view of the market. However, it is most effective in gradually rising markets with low implied volatility. Under these conditions, options sellers benefit as the expiry date approaches and the options lose value.



Bitcoin was trading at $66,940 at the time of writing, representing a 1.23% gain on the day. The leading cryptocurrency’s bullish outlook appears to remain intact, having rebounded from support at $61,000 earlier this week.

How Web3 Marketing Changes the Game

Years before anyone used the term “Web3,” Novaes hatched a project that rewarded users for doing everyday tasks, like watching videos or reading the news: Mode Mobile. People liked it. Using a custom smartphone, the “EarnOS” lets you stream music and get paid for it, hence the tagline “turning smartphones into earnphones.” Mode Mobile was named as Deloitte’s #1 fastest growing software company, has over 10 million downloads on the Google Play store, and claims to have helped users earn and save over $250 million. More importantly, the model lets brands reach consumers directly… without forking over rent to Google or Facebook.

Linus Torvalds on Why He Does Not Like Cryptocurrencies | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent forum post, renowned Finnish-American software engineer Linus Torvalds, best known for creating the Linux operating system, expressed his skepticism about cryptocurrencies. 



Linus Torvalds is a prominent Finnish-American software engineer best known for creating the Linux operating system. Born on 28 December 1969 in Helsinki, Finland, Torvalds displayed an early interest in computers and programming. He pursued a master’s degree in computer science at the University of Helsinki, where he began working on what would become Linux.



In 1991, Torvalds started developing Linux as a personal project. Initially, it was meant to be a free alternative to MINIX, a Unix-like operating system used for educational purposes. On 25 August 1991, Torvalds announced his project on a Usenet newsgroup, inviting others to contribute. This collaborative approach attracted a community of developers who helped improve and expand the system.



Linux is an open-source operating system, meaning its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This philosophy contrasts with proprietary software, where the source code is kept secret. The open-source nature of Linux has contributed to its widespread adoption and adaptation across various platforms and devices, from servers and supercomputers to smartphones and embedded systems.



Torvalds’ creation has significantly impacted the tech industry, fostering the development of numerous distributions or “distros” tailored to different user needs. Some well-known distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian. These variations have enabled Linux to thrive in diverse environments, from personal computers to enterprise servers.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Beyond Linux, Torvalds has also created other important software projects. One notable example is Git, a distributed version control system developed in 2005. Git has become an essential tool for software development, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently.



Torvalds’ contributions have earned him numerous accolades, including the Millennium Technology Prize in 2012. He remains actively involved in the Linux community, overseeing the development of the Linux kernel, the core component of the operating system. Torvalds’ work has left an indelible mark on the world of technology, exemplifying the power of open-source software and collaborative development.



On May 17, in a post on the Real World Technologies Forums, Torvalds made his stance on cryptocurrencies abundantly clear. The mastermind behind Linux dismissed cryptocurrencies as nothing more than vehicles for scams. He likened them to a Ponzi scheme that thrives on attracting “the next sucker holding the bag.” Torvalds compared the belief in cryptocurrencies to believing in Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, or the Easter bunny, emphasizing his skepticism about their legitimacy and value.



When confronted by a forum user who accused him of misunderstanding cryptocurrencies, Torvalds responded with a pointed rebuttal. He sarcastically invited the user to “mansplain” cryptocurrencies to him but suggested they first educate themselves on blockchains and the use of cryptographic hashes for validating chains of events. Torvalds highlighted that he was involved in significant cryptographic projects well before the advent of Bitcoin. He further implied that the accuser might be one of the “bagholders” trying to offload worthless assets onto others, underscoring his critical view of the cryptocurrency market.

                        BounceBit, a new Bitcoin restaking startup, has announced a detailed roadmap for 2024 aimed at democratizing high-yield Bitcoin investing by merging centralized and decentralized finance (CeDeFi). Backed by Binance, the startup’s ambitious plan involves enhancing infrastructure and introducing new products while maintaining Bitcoin’s core technology.BounceBit Unveils Plans for Bitcoin Democracy By Blending Centralized and Decentralized Infrastructure
In a May 20 Medium blog post, BounceBit revealed in its roadmap, its vision to combine the liquidity and structure of centralized exchanges like Coinbase with decentralized infrastructure for Bitcoin. The company emphasized it would not launch a sidechain or layer-2 solution, distancing itself from recent trends like runes and BRC-20 tokens, which it views as short-term hypes.In April, Binance Labs, Binance’s venture arm, announced its investment in BounceBit. While the deal’s size was not disclosed, Binance Labs’ Yi He highlighted that the startup “unlocks new avenues for Bitcoin’s utilization with the fusion of CeFi and DeFi.” BounceBit’s vision is encapsulated in its CeDeFi framework, which has been operational since its inception a few months ago. This framework merges the security of Centralized Finance (CeFi) with the potential of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). According to the roadmap, BounceBit’s protocol development is divided into three pillars: BounceBit Portal, BounceBit Chain, and BounceClub, each with its own designated roadmap. The startup plans to enhance the BounceBit Chain, a proof-of-stake layer-1 chain secured by validators staking Bitcoin and BounceBit’s native token, BB. This will involve optimizing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution layer to improve node performance. The BounceBit Portal is the operating system that allows easy interaction with the protocol’s products. Planned services include fixed earnings for investors seeking stable returns, over-collateralized lending and borrowing, and additional structured products tailored to investors’ needs.BounceClub will aid users in launching their own CeDeFi products using BounceBit’s widget. BounceBit’s role will include maintaining the whitelist for contract deployment and creating general components, while the official website will provide these components without hosting business logic for Decentralized Applications (DApps).Bitcoin Going Toward A New ATH After $67K Resistance Level
Bitcoin’s price is poised for new all-time highs if it can surpass the critical resistance level of $67,500. Markus Thielen of 10x Research believes that breaking through this level could trigger a bullish rally, especially given Bitcoin’s recent recovery above the $66,000 threshold and a 7.3% growth over the past week. He emphasizes that overcoming $67,500 could validate Bitcoin ETF model projections, driving the cryptocurrency to new highs.Recent trends in the United States show positive inflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs for two consecutive weeks, with over $200 million net inflow. However, this is lower than the previous week’s $413 million. Institutional inflows through ETFs have significantly contributed to Bitcoin’s rally, accounting for 75% of new investments and pushing its price past $50,000. A breakthrough at $67,500 could liquidate nearly $300 million in leveraged short positions, indicating strong bullish momentum.

Will RFK Jr. Debate Trump or Biden? Probably Not, Prediction Market Says

The apparent bearish sentiment is likely not due to the lack of buying pressure, either. Two dog tokens, bonk (BONK), dogwifhat (WIF), and the frog-themed pepe (PEPE), were launched in 2023 and zoomed to over $3 billion each in less than a year, showcasing the demand for such tokens.

Blockchain tracker Whale Alert has reported a substantial transfer of 50 million XRP tokens from Ripple Labs Inc. to an unknown wallet, valued at approximately $25.7 million. This transaction follows closely on the heels of another large-scale movement by the payment processing firm just last week, where over 100 million XRP were sent to an external wallet. Ripple, a leading company in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector, holds a significant portion of the circulating supply of XRP, numbering in the billions. The company periodically sells portions of its holdings to fund its operational activities and support various initiatives within the blockchain ecosystem. These transactions are part of Ripple's broader strategy to manage its cryptocurrency reserves and ensure liquidity for its operations.As expected, the news of these transfers has sparked speculation within the cryptocurrency community, particularly regarding whether these transfers are indicative of Ripple offloading its holdings. Such large-scale movements of XRP tokens often prompt discussions about their potential impact on the market, including the price of XRP itself.XRP's market dynamicsAt the time of the latest transfer, XRP had seen a minor decline of 1.63% over the past 24 hours, with its current trading price hovering around $0.5114. Despite this daily fluctuation, the cryptocurrency has recorded a modest gain of 1.78% over the past week, indicating some stability amid recent market movements.The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve rapidly, and Ripple's strategic decisions regarding its XRP holdings are closely monitored by investors and analysts alike. The timing and scale of these transfers can influence market sentiment and broader trends within the cryptocurrency space.As the community awaits further updates and market responses, the implications of Ripple's recent transactions will likely continue to be a topic of interest, shedding light on the company's ongoing role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and its impact on XRP's market dynamics.

Ripple Vs. SEC Update: Here’s Why Today Is Incredibly Important To The Lawsuit | Bitcoinist.com


								May 20 is an important day in the long-running legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple. The Commission is expected to file a response to the crypto firm’s motion, which seeks to protect the company’s business interests. 
SEC To File Opposition To Ripple’s Sealing Requests
A court filing shows that the Commission must file its letter brief in opposition to Ripple’s motion to seal by May 20. Ripple had filed the motion on May 13 in line with the scheduling order, which stipulated that date as the deadline for both parties to file a motion to seal any document related to the remedies stage. 

Ripple had revealed in their May 13 filing that they had consulted with the SEC before making the sealing requests. The crypto firm further claimed that the Commission “indicated that they consent to certain of Ripple’s requests, but intend to oppose others.” Therefore, based on that revelation, the Commission will likely agree to some of Ripple’s quests. 
One part that the Commission seems to have consented to is the redaction of the names of some of the firm’s business partners, whose partnership with Ripple hasn’t been officially disclosed. However, Ripple is asking for more than just that as the company seeks to seal the identities of third parties whose identities have no bearing on the outcome of the case. 
The crypto firm has also requested that the court seal or redact certain documents that reflect or show Ripple’s audited financial statements or other financial documents. The company stated that those documents are non-public and disclosing them “would cause significant harm to the company’s business interests and competitive standing.”
Meanwhile, Ripple also seeks to seal or redact information about its confidential business relationships. They argued that the redactions are “narrow” and only relate to “specific financial and pricing terms” that it had negotiated with its business partners. The crypto firm noted that its requests are similar to the proposed redactions that the court granted during the summary judgment.
Joy Is Coming For The Crypto Industry
The cause of Ripple’s legal woes against the SEC has been the lack of regulatory clarity for the crypto industry in the US. However, that is about to change soon enough, as the US Congress will soon vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) bill, which would provide regulatory clarity for crypto companies. 

If passed, the bill will establish the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the primary agency responsible for regulating crypto assets. This will provide a huge turnaround, considering that the SEC has, for the longest time, extended its jurisdiction to all crypto-related matters and sought to clamp down on crypto companies through its enforcement actions.

Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein steps down

Michael Sonnenshein will be stepping down from his role as the CEO of Grayscale Investments LLC.Sonnenshein will be replaced by former Goldman Sachs executive Peter Mintzberg as of Aug 15, according to Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of Grayscale.Silbert wrote in a May 20 X post:“As we position Grayscale for its next phase of growth, excited to welcome Peter Mintzberg as Grayscale’s CEO, effective August 15. Joining from Goldman Sachs, Peter has 20+ years of experience across prominent asset managers, including BlackRock, OppenheimerFunds & Invesco.”Founded in 2013, Grayscale is among the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency asset management firms, with over $50 billion worth of assets under management as of September 2021.During his 10 years as CEO, Sonnenshein played a pivotal role in the launch of the first United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Silbert, who wrote:“Michael guided the firm through exponential growth & oversaw its pivotal role in bringing spot bitcoin ETFs to market, leading the way for the broader financial industry. We wish him the best in his future endeavors.”Grayscale was among the first spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the United States. Its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) was converted into an ETF on Jan. 11, while the fund has previously been operating since 2013, making it the first publicly traded Bitcoin fund according to Grayscale.Grayscale’s GBTC is the largest ETF by on-chain Bitcoin investments, currently holding over 287,801 Bitcoin (BTC) worth $19.3 billion, with a 34.9% market share. However, Grayscale also requires investors to pay the highest fee — 1.5%, compared to the industry standard of 0.20% to 0.25%.In comparison, BlackRock’s iShares ETF (IBIT) is the second-largest, holding over 274,000 BTC worth $18.4 billion, with a 33.3% market share, according to Dune.Largest U.S. Bitcoin ETFs.

In meme coin news this week, the GME token recently came out of dormancy, recording significant gains over the past several days.In the last 24 hours alone, it appreciated 42%, changing hands at $0.007012.Moreover, in the past seven days, it saw a massive increase of 187%.At the time of writing, it’s the best-performing coin in the 24-hour category.In the 7-day category, only OMIKAMI and PONKE surpass it.The coin’s sudden jump can be seen clearly on the 1-month chart, as shown below.Source: CoinGeckoWhile trading sideways for the past two months or so, the coin shoots up on May 12.It rose 2,107% by the following day and 3,865% by May 14.Just a day later, it hit its all-time high of $0.02167, dropping 67% since.As reported, the Ethereum-based token saw a revival following the return to Twitter of trader Roaring Kitty, known for sparking the (in)famous GameStop frenzy in the first place.This post has been viewed over 27.5 million times so far.Also, the latest surge unsurprisingly prompted the creation of more GME-named coins.As for the GME stock, it jumped from $17.46 to $48.75 by May 14, a 179.2% increase.It’s up 122% in the past month and down 15.55% in the past five days.Source: GoogleOver the last day, it fell nearly 20% to $22.21.This shows that the meme coin far outperformed the stock.FLOKI DAO Votes ‘Yes’ to Burning 15.25 Billion Coins
FLOKI announced on Wednesday that the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) had voted in favor of burning almost 15.25 billion FLOKI tokens, currently worth just below $3 million.Notably, the decision was reached nearly unanimously.The coins will be burnt this week.The proposal went live on May 13.It noted that the DAO held three key burn-related votes so far.“In each of these cases, the decision of the Floki DAO was swiftly executed, making it clear that Floki is a completely decentralized cryptocurrency and the Floki DAO ultimately determines the direction of the project,” it said.One of the votes focused on burning excess tokens recovered from the blacklisted wallet in July 2022.Some of the affected wallets did not send in the tokens before the deadline. However, one of these recently sent more than 15 billion FLOKI (currently worth over $2.8m million), asking “for a small incentive in return.”The proposal suggested giving the affected wallet 1% of the tokens returned (154,000,000 tokens), hoping to incentivize other affected wallets to send in the excess tokens they currently hold.The excess tokens not returned should be considered burnt and inaccessible, the proposal said. The blacklisted wallets cannot do anything with them except send them to the Floki multisig.FLOKI is down 1.5% over the past 24 hours, currently trading at $0.000196.However, it appreciated nearly 14% over the past week.Meanwhile, FLOKI also recently announced that it’s nearing half a million followers on its CoinMarketCap community page.Notably, Revolut Business recently listed FLOKI, enabling European commercial accounts to invest in the asset.Shina Inu Could Hit $1 by 2050
In other meme coin news, by 2050, SHIB could be worth $1. This would be an excellent development for long-term big bag holders.To reach this conclusion, forecaster Telegaon analyzed factors such as market trends, investor sentiment, trading volume, technological developments, and external influences, it said.Per the analysts’ predictions, SHIB’s max price this year could reach $0.0000601.In 2025, that price could rise to $0.0000728. At the end of this decade, we could see the token reach $0.000712.Over the next few years, it could lose some of those front zeroes.Five years later, we’re looking at a possibility of $0.00216, followed by $0.089 in 2040, and $1.06 in 2050.The average price by 2050 could reach $0.89 and a minimum of $0.62.Source: TelegaonCurrently the 12th coin per market cap, SHIB trades at $0.00002396.It is down 0.3% in a day and up 0.5% in a week.Over the past year, the coin’s price increased by 175%.It hit its all-time high of $0.00008616 in October 2021. SHIB has dropped 72% since.The coin, however, is up a whopping 42,564,577.6% from its all-time low seen in November 2020.

                        The introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on U.S. exchanges in January 2024 has significantly influenced the Bitcoin market dynamics. The development has paved the way for institutional investors, who were previously hesitant due to the regulatory ambiguities and the complexities of trading and storing cryptocurrencies, to enter the Bitcoin market in a safe and regulated manner. Amid continued interest in spot ETFs, Bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $73,750 in March 2024.Soon after the launch, Bitcoin spot ETFs drew significant investments. The situation shifted in April and early May when outflows reached more than $1.2 billion. Despite this downturn, the past two weeks have seen a strong recovery, with $1.3 billion flowing back into these ETFs. This recent influx has compensated for April’s losses, bringing their total net gains since launching to approximately $12.3 billion. Total Bitcoin spot ETF net inflow (USD). Source: Coinglass.comPredicting Bitcoin Price with ETF Flows
Recent research by Mieszko Mazur and Efstathios Polyzos examines the effects of these newly established Bitcoin spot ETFs on the price of the leading cryptocurrency. The paper suggests the strong predictive power of net flows to Bitcoin spot ETFs on BTC prices. Per the research, this relationship is so strong that a one standard deviation increase in net flows (about $3 billion) results in a Bitcoin price appreciation of $9,300.Bitcoin ETFs net flows and Bitcoin price. Source: Mieszko Mazur, Efstathios PolyzosAccording to the paper, despite the initial negative net flows causing a decline in Bitcoin prices following the ETFs’ launch, a significant increase in net flows after week 4 led to a rapid price rise, peaking at an all-time high. The study further explores the relationship between Bitcoin price movements and ETF trading volumes. It claims that increases in Bitcoin prices are shown to lead to abnormal trading volumes in the ETFs, highlighting the interconnected nature of price and volume dynamics.Bitcoin Price Returns Generated Outside US Trading Hours
The analysis reveals that 95% of Bitcoin price returns are generated outside of US exchange trading hours. This suggests that significant price movements are driven by market participants who are active outside the ETF trading window, such as international traders and algorithmic trading systems.Bitcoin performance during ETF trading vs. non-trading hours. Source: Mieszko Mazur, Efstathios PolyzosThe finding is in line with an April report from Bloomberg that showed automated trading protocols in Asia react to flow data from US ETFs. According to the report, these trading bots can automatically analyze and react to this data, resulting in buying or selling actions. This pattern of flows helps explain why market returns during Asian trading hours were particularly strong in February and early March but weakened later in March.The impact of algorithmic protocols dumping Bitcoin extends beyond the spot market and affects the derivatives market as well, the report said.“By their very nature, inflows into the ETF structure are “buys” and outflows are “sells,”Abdul Rafay Gadit, CFO and co-founder at decentralized social-investing marketplace Zignaly, told Cryptonews.com. He added that ETFs have a holdings mandate, which includes guidelines on how much of the fund’s assets can be held in different forms such as cash, stocks, bonds, or other securities. “If they can’t hold more than 10%, for example, in cash, inflows would necessitate a buy of BTC,” Gadit said. Similarly, suppose redemptions (outflows) increase the fund’s cash holdings beyond the mandated levels (for example, below an 8% threshold). In that case, the fund must sell some of its Bitcoin holdings to reduce its cash holdings to within the required limits.Impact of Bitcoin ETF Flows on Price “Exaggerated”
Some analysts believe the impact of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and outflows on Bitcoin’s price has not been necessarily transformative. “The impact of ETF inflows/outflows is slightly exaggerated,” Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at cryptocurrency exchange YouHodler, told Cryptonews.com.“Until now, ETFs have played with just a few percent of all Bitcoin free-float; the dependency is likely the opposite. When Bitcoin price rises, it attracts more retail investors to buy BTC ETFs, resulting in inflows; when it falls, retail investors sell ETFs in panic, therefore leading to outflows.”Likewise, a report from The Block suggests that negative investment flows and unfavorable macroeconomic news typically lead to poor price performance in financial markets. Conversely, positive macroeconomic news can mitigate the impact of negative flows, at least temporarily. Therefore, it’s important to monitor investment flows, but they should not be the sole focus, especially for short-term decision-making, according to Teddy Fusaro at Bitwise. “Spot Bitcoin ETF flows are important, but they are just one part of a much larger, dynamic marketplace,” Fusaro told the media.Major US Financial Institutions Buy Spot ETFs
A significant number of major US financial institutions, including banks, investment managers, hedge funds, and professional firms, have embraced spot Bitcoin ETFs in recent months, 13F filings submitted to the SEC show.

GameStop Mania: Are Roaring Kitty's Tweets a Hidden Message? - DailyCoin


        

Roaring Kitty returns from an extended social media break, triggering a GameStop stock price surge.



Since returning, Roaring Kitty has been spam-posting countless shorts, leading some to believe a hidden message is contained within.



Others have voiced deep skepticism over Roaring Kitty’s return.




Roaring Kitty, AKA Keith Gill, an influential figure from the 2021 GameStop squeeze, unexpectedly resurfaced on social media this month after nearly three years of silence. Roaring Kitty’s return on May 13 had the effect of reigniting GameStop mania, sending its stock price 160% higher to peak at $64.90 on May 14. 



While GME has sold off significantly since topping, Roaring Kitty’s prolific posting on X has continued unabated. The content posted features a glut of seemingly random film clips, TV show excerpts, and the occasional meme, leading some to believe that the influencer is communicating a hidden message to those with eyes to see.



GameStop Hidden Message



The Roaring Kitty X account has been posting a dizzying array of movie clips and memes since his return on May 13, leading some to believe hidden messages are woven into the posts. There are no obvious consistent themes beyond many shorts being doctored to feature references to cats, GameStop, or mockery of bearish sentiment.




Nonetheless, die-hard GameStop supporters like wallstreetbets have been feverishly attempting to decode what they view as a reverse meme movie unspooling Roaring Kitty’s master plan. The random shorts convinced wallstreetbets to go “balls deep” into GME when trading reopens on Monday.







Others have taken the hidden message theories even further. X influencer Kinky Kong.AI claimed to have noted Morse code within the eye blinks of one of the shared video clips. Software engineer G-OHMie analyzed audio spectrograms and detected the secret message “hang in there” embedded in another Roaring Kitty post accompanied by the iconic hanging cat meme.



While some seek to decipher hidden meanings in the posts, an opposing narrative has emerged, casting doubt on Roaring Kitty’s motivations to lead a reprisal of 2021’s GameStop short squeeze.



Is Roaring Kitty’s Return a CIA Psyop?



Despite the belief that Roaring Kitty has returned to lead investors in a reprisal of 2021’s GameStop short squeeze, others have reacted with intense skepticism toward his resurfacing. Former SEC chair Jay Clayton called for Gill to appear on CNBC to explain his cryptic posting behavior if he truly cares about markets and investing as portrayed. 




However, Clayton also believed that Gill’s actions do not constitute insider trading, as “he is trading on his own information.”



More sinister theories have also emerged, with economist MikeCristo8 alleging that Roaring Kitty is a CIA asset deployed to divert investor capital from gold ahead of an impending “credit event.” Prominent Bitcoin bull Max Keiser echoed these claims, also accusing Gill of being a government operative.



Semi-retired hedge fund founder “₿ΞΞnThereDoneThat Capital” took a different angle, stating that the more Roaring Kitty posts “meaningless videos,” the more he is inclined to believe his Twitter account was sold, and the individual behind the recent deluge of tweets is an impersonator.



On the Flipside




Confirmation bias is the psychological phenomenon of ascribing events to fit a belief, no matter how seemingly obscure or random.



GME closed down 66% on Friday from the May 14 local top.



Retail investors and society in general have felt increasingly disenfranchised by the financial system and elite Wall Street interests.




Why This Matters



While Roaring Kitty’s return’s true intentions remain mysterious, investing calls cannot be made on baffling narratives and vague assumptions drawn from random shorts.

COPA Vs. Wright: Ruling Ends Fake Bitcoin Inventor Saga


								The long-standing legal drama between the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) and Dr. Craig Steven Wright concluded today with a definitive ruling from the court. Dr. Wright, who has famously claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, was found to have engaged in extensive and deliberate deception to support his assertion, thus ending one of the most sensational identity claims in the history of technology with a resounding judicial rejection.
The case against Dr. Wright centered on his bold assertion of being the actual person behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who in 2008 introduced Bitcoin to the world through the publication of the white paper followed by the release of the original source code. COPA, representing a consortium of cryptocurrency entities, challenged Wright’s claims, leading to a comprehensive judicial review of his purported evidence and testimonials.
COPA Triumphs Over Fake Bitcoin Inventor
The presiding judge expressed a scathing view of Wright’s testimony, stating that throughout the trial, Wright presented evidence that was “clumsy” in its attempt to deceive. “Dr. Wright is not nearly as clever as he thinks he is,” the judge noted, elaborating that the defendant engaged in a pattern of lies, forgeries, and blaming others for discrepancies and falsehoods exposed during the trial.

“As soon as one lie was exposed, Dr Wright resorted to further lies and evasions. The final destination frequently turned out to be either Dr Wright blaming some other (often unidentified) person for his predicament or what can only be described as incoherent,” the ruling states.
Among the forgeries were documents that Wright presented as proof of his involvement in the creation of Bitcoin, which were later shown to have been altered or fabricated. The judgment highlighted the fact that, despite Wright’s attempts to appear technologically and forensically astute, the forgery attempts were amateurish and easily discernible by experts.
Significantly damaging to Wright’s case was the testimony of Mr. Stefan Matthews, Chairman of nChain Group, who initially supported Wright but whose statements under scrutiny revealed inconsistencies and deliberate falsehoods. The judge pointed out that while Matthews was “more careful in his lies,” his testimony ultimately did not withstand the evidence to the contrary presented by COPA.
Conversely, Pieter Wuille, a well-known developer in the Bitcoin community, provided a witness statement that was deemed by the judge as “the most significant document in this trial.” Wuille’s detailed exposition of the timeline and technical details of Bitcoin’s development was instrumental in debunking Wright’s claims. His testimony, unchallenged by Wright’s defense, provided clear, credible insights into the technical workings of Bitcoin, contrasting sharply with Wright’s fabricated narratives.


The judgment underscored that Dr. Wright’s false claims and the subsequent legal maneuvers constituted a “serious abuse” of the court’s process, not only in the United Kingdom but also in other jurisdictions such as Norway. The court deferred decisions on the specifics of injunctive relief, with further hearings scheduled to discuss the implications of the judgment and the potential corrections to public records concerning the Bitcoin white paper and other documents.

“I am entirely satisfied that Dr Wright lied to the Court extensively and repeatedly. Most of his lies related to the document he had forged which purported to support his claim. All his lies and forged documents were in support of his biggest lie: his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto,” the judge concluded.
The crypto community has watched the case unfold with keen interest, given its potential implications for the perception of Bitcoin’s origin and the integrity of its foundational documents. BitMEX Research, in a statement, highlighted the ongoing legal considerations about the accessibility of the Bitcoin whitepaper on platforms like Bitcoin.org, noting that future rulings could further clarify these aspects.
In a humorous side note, BitMEX Research remarked, “The ‘key’ evidence from Danielle DeMorgan, Wright’s youngest sister, was that CSW ‘had dressed as a ninja in the local park’. This did not give ‘any credence to Dr Wright’s claim to be Satoshi ‘Who would have thought??”

Dogwifhat dips, whale invests! What’s next for WIF prices? - AMBCrypto



WIF saw an over 2% increase in value.
A whale has accumulated over 200,000 so far.

dogwifhat [WIF] was one of the biggest losers in the past week, experiencing significant price declines. Despite this downturn, there has been a notable accumulation from a particular wallet, indicating some investor confidence or strategic buying amidst the dip.
Whale accumulates dogwifhat
According to data from Lookonchain, a newly created wallet recently withdrew $1.8 million worth USDC from Coinbase. This wallet then used 606,000 USDC to buy 227,896 dogwifhat at approximately $2.66 per token. 
The accumulation is ongoing, with the wallet still holding about 1.2 million USDC. 
This purchase is notable because WIF had been experiencing significant downtrends over the past seven days, making this trade a bullish move despite the recent declines.
WIF stays in a bear trend
Analysis of the dogwifhat price trend on a daily time frame showed that WIF experienced an uptrend only once in the last seven days. This occurred on 15th May, when the price increased by 9.50% to trade above $3. 
However, it subsequently declined, reaching around $2.50 by 19th May after an almost 1% drop. At the time of this writing, WIF was trading at approximately $2.60, reflecting a 3% increase.
Source: TradingView
Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) analysis indicated a poor price trend over the past few days. The RSI was below the neutral line, signaling a bearish trend. 
The only time in the past few weeks that WIF was clearly above the neutral line was during the over 9% increase on 15th May. Since then, it has remained below the neutral line.
WIF sees more long liquidations
Analysis of the dogwifhat liquidation trend on Coinglass showed that long positions have experienced more liquidation in the past few days. 
This indicated that traders who were expecting the price of WIF to increase have had their positions wiped out due to the recent price declines. 
Between the 18th and 19th of May, over $2.3 million in long positions were liquidated.
Source: Coinglass

Realistic or not, here’s WIF’s market cap in BTC’s terms

 At the time of this writing, short positions were seeing more liquidations due to the recent uptrend in WIF’s price.
Given that the whale wallet accumulated WIF at around $2.66, a fall below this price range would result in a loss for these holdings.

Bitcoin Retail Investors Are Dumping Amid Jump To $67,000, Why This Is Good For Price


																The Bitcoin price recovery above the $67,000 level has triggered a round of selling, but it is not from the usual camp of large investors selling. This time around, it is the small-time traders who are offloading their bags and putting selling pressure on the price. However, this is not an entirely bad thing given that, historically, such selling has been bullish for the Bitcoin price.
Bitcoin Retail Are Dumping Their Bags
In a report on X (formerly Twitter), the on-chain data tracker Santiment revealed an interesting trend among small-time Bitcoin investors. As the price of Bitcoin rallied past $67,000 over the weekend, these small wallets took this as the time to sell and secure profit.

	Related Reading



These wallets are those holding below 0.1 BTC on their balances. This means that at the high end, these wallets are holding an average of $6,000. In the space of one week, Santiment notes that their collective holdings had dropped 0.46%.

Selling among smaller wallets is not new, but at this level, it could have a significant impact on the price. However, compared to when whale and sharks sell their BTC holdings, retail investors selling is usually bullish for the price. This is because as the smaller traders sell, the BTC is picked up by the larger traders, who are usually longer-term holdings.
As blockchain agency Crynet explains in a response to Santiment: “While small traders divesting might seem concerning, it’s often a bullish signal. Historically, this redistribution to larger holders indicates stronger hands in the market. Let’s see how this plays out.”
Bullish Sentiment Rises Among Investors
The selling by small Bitcoin traders comes amid a jump in bullishness. As Santiment reported in a previous post, bullishness among Bitcoin investors has now jumped to a 4-month high. The last time that investors were this bullish was back in January 2024 when the price of BTC had jumped above $45,000.

Bitcoin’s weighted sentiment is now sitting at a value of 0.99, and although this is still lower than its January high of almost 1.8, it remains one of the highest among large caps. Currently, only the Chainlink (LINK) weighted sentiment is higher after rising to a new one-year high of 1.829.

The Ethereum weighted sentiment is currently sitting at a low -0.44, while XRP and Binance’s BNB are sitting at around -0.37. This suggests that bearishness continues to dominate among these assets while crypto investors look to Bitcoin to lead the market.
At the time of writing, the BTC price is still trading at a high price of $66,900. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is seeing a 6.78% increase in the last week and a small decline of 0.5% in the last day, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

Meme coin trading volume skyrocket despite market turbulence - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Meme tokens are defying the typical market downturn behavior, maintaining their position as some of the year’s top performers, according to a report by research firm Kaiko. Despite a recent market correction, these tokens have seen year-to-date returns ranging from 80% to 1,800%. Moreover, meme coin trading volume remains strong, with a more than 200% increase year-to-date, totaling around $11 billion weekly.Image: KaikoThe sustained interest in meme tokens may stem from their adaptability to market trends and accessibility, which continues to draw substantial community engagement, highlights the report. Yet, it’s crucial to acknowledge the higher leverage meme coins carry compared to most altcoins, often fueled by speculative trading.In an interesting twist, the correlation between meme coins and other speculative retail assets, such as meme stocks, has been inconsistent and volatile. For example, the 60-day rolling correlation between DOGE and GameStop (GME) has generally stayed below 0.3 over the past year.Last week, meme stocks like GME and AMC Entertainment saw unexpected gains, which led to a spike in the correlation between DOGE and GME, marking the highest point in over a year.The sudden spike in GME and AMC stock prices is related to the return of RoaringKitty, one of the key figures behind the GME pump seen in late 2020.Image: KaikoCrypto liquidity remains divided among exchanges and assets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum holding the lion’s share. In 2024, Bitcoin’s average daily 1% market depth was over $270 million, dwarfing the liquidity of most top altcoins by more than tenfold. Ethereum followed as the second most liquid asset, with an average market depth of $190 million.However, the landscape is shifting. Altcoin liquidity, in comparison to Bitcoin’s daily market depth, has been on the rise for the past two years. This change aligns with a decrease in Ethereum’s liquidity relative to Bitcoin’s, dropping from 83% in 2022 to 72% in 2024.

Mobs of Bonk Inu Token Traders Now Buying Mollars ICO


                        
                            Mobs of Bonk Inu Token Traders Now Buying Mollars ICO                        
                        

                         Large mobs of Bonk Inu (BONK) token traders appear to be migrating into the ICO for Ethereum-Blockchain’s new store-of-value asset; A rival token for Bitcoin.     Climbing in popularity, Mollars token presale, has raised over $1.35-million-dollars and is still surging.   The brand has become so popular, Google Trends shows it’s gotten 90% of the search volume of already established $BONK.   As that news made headlines over the weekend, a swatch of Bonk Inu holders appear to have migrated over to the Mollars initial coin offering.The report published by Coingape Saturday showed evidence of how the Mollars token rose to a popularity that now rivals Bonk inu.   The data was derived from Google Trends, a public data application that shows statistics on search.  This is used by many to determine how strong or weak a brand has gotten.For Mollars, the Google Trends feature has shown the brand is surging in popularity. Over the last 30 days, there have been moments where the search for the “MOLLARS” keyword term have exploded to over 50x it’s normal rate.Such data proves that the Mollars brand is a cryptocurrency on the rise and perhaps enough to confirm most of the earlier predictions were not high enough.   The top prediction  may have been the most accurate however, a 10,000% ROI yield, suggested on ZyCrypto.Brand Popularity Increases Token Prices
At the time Mollars token prediction, the presale was new and it appears the analyst behind the post had a good foresight on what the project’s popularity would become.  Released in December, the presale was likely under US$100,000 in funds raised as another news report shows the ICO reached $315,000 almost 1 month later.Today, the Mollars token is near its ending deadline of June 1st and raised over $1.35-million-dollars.     It’s estimated thousands of crypto traders have already acquired rights to tokens prior to its launch on crypto exchanges.At least 3 exchanges, with over 20-million users cumulatively, have already confirmed they will list $MOLLARS token on or around June 2nd.Other factors that have since changed and could increase the token’s price predictions are the project developer’s announcement of a new decentralized crypto exchange that will rely on the Mollars token.  Set to launch on the secondary domain of the brand, “Mollars.CC,” it could put the token price into a hyper driven volatility.   And that would also mean, the more people that use this exchange, the further scarce $MOLLARS will become.  This could increase token value massively and rapidly.Bonk Inu & Pepe Trading Volumes TodayAs for another Google Trends that’s been noted, Mollars is half as popular as Pepe ($PEPE) token as well. The popular memecoin is ranked as the 27th most traded cryptocurrency of today.Bonk Inu (BONK), though it’s been better for ROI gains due to volatility in price, is the 61st most traded cryptocurrency today.What is the Market Cap rank now?By market capitalization, Pepe (PEPE)  is rated 26th highest cryptocurrency.  It has an MC of nearly $3.95-billion-dollars.Bonk Inu (BONK) holds the rank of 55th highest.  It has a market cap of $1.64-billion-dollars. The capitalization is a goliath figure considering the token launched barely 2 years ago.Such data can be used to help with future predictions of Mollars.   With the brand being nearly halfway as popular or 90% as popular as the two tokens,  it’s clear there’s a massive audience with interest in the new ERC-20 token.All of these factors are perhaps why the Bonk Inu audience is migrating over into the Mollars presale.  WIth it being just $0.55-cents per token today, the predictions for it to rise between 20x and 100x in value make it seem that it’s a portal to faster gains.What is Mollars token for?
Mollars will be the first Bitcoin-like, store-of-value token on the Ethereum-blockchain with its type of project infrastructure.The total token supply is half that of Bitcoin with only 10-million tokens to be minted.   Forty-percent of that supply is allocated to the presale, with nearly 3-million already bought by investors.The total token supply of Mollars is half that of Bitcoin (BTC), and it has a deflationary feature in its smart contract that’s supposed to help it burn tokens to lower supply over time.Also, once demand rises well above supply, traders will begin referring to their fractional purchases of a Mollars token as a ‘Moll.’  This is the term designated to token holders holding 1/110th of a coin.

                        The Dogecoin price has fallen by 1% in the past 24 hours, dropping to $0.1522 on a disappointing day for the cryptocurrency market as a whole.Despite this drop, DOGE is up by 5.5% in a week, although it does remain down by 9% in the past fortnight and has barely moved in a month.Having said that, Dogecoin has gained by over 100% in a year, and with meme tokens potentially on course for their own season of out-performance, the coin could rally again very soon.Dogecoin Price Prediction as $700 Million Floods In – $1 DOGE Possible in June?
DOGE looks ready to recover after a difficult day yesterday, with the coin’s indicators showing a return of some momentum.After looking like it would fall below the 200-day average (blue), the 30-day average (orange) has flattened and may begin rising again, a sign of incoming gains.Source: TradingViewLikewise, DOGE’s relative strength index (purple) has recovered from 30 yesterday to just over 50 as of writing, with this rise pointing to increased buying pressure.What’s interesting is that DOGE’s trading volume has risen slightly today to $700 million, yet this is still low enough that a big buy from a whale could push the coin’s price up much higher.Yet, at the moment, it seems that whales have been offloading DOGE rather than buying it, which could mean that we may have to wait a few more days for a rebound.A rebound will certainly arrive, however, with Dogecoin remaining highly popular and also remaining in oversold territory.Its biggest long-term hopes reside with Elon Musk and X, which finally switched to the x.com domain last week as part of its transition from a social network to a broader digital platform.Such a transition will also include digital payments, which in turn may include DOGE transfers.If so, there’s no doubt that the Dogecoin price will rocket, potentially breaking its all-time high of $0.7316, which it recorded three years ago now.In the near term, it could reach $0.2 by the end of the summer, with an increasingly bullish market helping it up.The Dogecoin price could rise even higher from September when economists expect the Fed to introduce rate cuts.Alternative Meme Tokens with Strong Fundamentals.
Because DOGE may take some time to really get going, traders may prefer to look at newer meme coins in the meantime.If so, one very promising candidate is WienerAI (WAI), a new Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has now raised just over $2.3 million in its presale.While it’s very much styled as a meme coin, WienerAI will primarily be a chatbot aimed at helping investors improve their trades and returns.Based around the same generative AI tech that powers ChatGPT, WienerAI will answer queries from traders, helping them pick potential winners and also time their moves.It will also feature two other important functions: an atomic swap capability (so that traders can act quickly on recommendations) and front-running protection, which helps traders make their trades ahead of arbitrage and front-running bots.As a token, it will have a max supply 69 billion tokens, making it deflationary in theory, especially if it attracts rising demand.It will also enable staking, meaning that a big percentage of its overall supply could exit circulation, thereby boosting its price over time.VIDEO Investors can join the coin’s sale by heading over to the official WienerAI website, where 1 WAI is selling for $0.000709.This price will rise by $0.000001 with every stage of the sale up until it ends, at which point it will list – and potentially rally – on exchanges.Buy WAI Today

This Chinese Teen Built A Bitcoin Exchange And Lost Out On $6B When It Got Hacked - Benzinga

Bitcoin Magazine editor Pete Rizzo took to his X account to share the story of Zhao Tong, who created the first-ever crypto margin exchange, Bitcoinica, and ultimately lost 99,000 Bitcoin BTC/USD with its downfall.What Happened: Tong, a 16-year-old Chinese teen, discovered Bitcoin in 2010 and was captivated by the idea of sending money globally. He enthusiastically shared this newfound concept with friends, sparking his deeper involvement in the emerging crypto landscape.Despite challenges like dealing with intermediaries, and enduring the unreliable Mt. Gox exchange of 2011, Zhao continued his efforts and built Bitcoinica in just four days. Unlike other exchanges, Bitcoinica allowed margin trading, enabling users to speculate on future prices. This attracted traders and miners pushing volume to $40 million per month.Also Read: Bitcoin Is Working Its Way Towards This ‘Liquidation Zone’ But There Is One Danger, Trader WarnsThe ProblemZhao’s youthful age and lack of experience raised concerns about the exchange’s security. Despite these reservations, he earned $10,000 (about 2,000 BTC at the time) within the first two weeks.While the year 2011 saw a thriving Bitcoinica, Zhao was overwhelmed with school exams and thus sold the company to Wendon. The new buyer sought to improve security with the help of veteran Bitcoin developers like Amir Taaki.With all efforts in vain, Bitcoinica was hacked in March 2012 losing 43,000 BTC. Subsequent attacks in the same month resulted in an additional 48,000 BTC being stolen. With no hardware wallets or multisig security measures in place, the hackers easily reset passwords to execute the thefts.Early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver reportedly lost over 24,000 BTC in these incidents. In his last act before exiting the industry, Zhao invested 1,000 BTC in a rare solid gold Casascius coin, one of only three in existence, now worth over $60 million.‘Prioritize Security'The precise details of what happened remain a mystery, but Zhao’s takeaway was clear: Bitcoin users and businesses must prioritize security. Zhao’s reputation was tarnished, and his name became synonymous with being cheated and robbed in the crypto community.Exchange hacks, like Bitcoinica’s, highlight the ongoing risks for crypto investors. To mitigate these risks, serious Bitcoin holders are advised to use hardware wallets or multi-sig custody.Today, Bitcoinica serves as a $6 billion lesson in the importance of taking custody seriously and safeguarding assets against potential hacks. It marks the third-largest ever loss in exchange hack.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Venture Capital Interest In Crypto Revives: $2.4B Poured Into Bitcoin And Crypto Firms In Q1 2024This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

SHIB Burn Party: 410 Trillion Gone, But Price Needs Help


							

Shiba Inu burns millions of SHIB despite price drop



Daily burn rate surges, but weekly volume lags



Over 410 trillion SHIB burned since launch




Shiba Inu’s daily token burn rate has surged despite a recent decline in the price of its native token, SHIB. A recent update on the SHIB burn tracker on X revealed a steep 62.58% increase in the burn rate within the last 24 hours, as the project removes several million SHIB tokens from circulation.







Through this latest burning initiative, the Shiba Inu community has successfully taken 6.9 million SHIB tokens out of circulation. Several transactions stand out among the ten executed thus far. These include burning large quantities of SHIB tokens at various intervals.



In addition to the recent burning of 6.9 million SHIB, the Shiba Inu community has eliminated several more tokens in the past week, bringing the total burned to 57.67 million SHIB over the past seven days. Interestingly, this represents a 57% decrease from the total burned the prior week. Therefore, the significant rise in the daily burn rate has yet to be reflected in the weekly burn volume.









Since its launch as a leading memecoin project in 2020, the Shiba Inu community has successfully burned over 410 trillion SHIB tokens. This leaves only 582.9 trillion SHIB in circulation out of the initial quadrillion tokens created. As of this writing, over 6.28 trillion SHIB remain locked in staking platforms.SHIB was trading for $0.00002393 at the time of writing, attempting to recover from a recent 5.84% price drop, according to data from TradingView.

Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch if the US Federal Reserve Cuts Rates


																TL;DR

The COVID-19 pandemic led to massive economic disruptions, prompting the US government to print trillions of dollars, which resulted in high inflation. 
To counter this, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to 5.25%- 5.50%.
Lowering rates, on the other hand, could boost investment in numerous cryptocurrencies, with the Fed previously hinting at such a pivot.



Apart from the numerous victims and pressure on the health sector, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at the start of 2020 resulted in vacated jobs, uncertainty, isolation, financial instability, and many other setbacks. Amid those gruesome conditions, the US government printed trillions of dollars to support the crippled economy. However, the increased money supply resulted in surging inflation rates and further problems for America’s fiscal policy.
The US Federal Reserve stepped in by enforcing multiple anti-inflationary measures, such as raising interest rates. Between March 2022 and July 2023, the central bank lifted the benchmark 11 consecutive times, with the current level standing at 5.25%-5.50%.
The latest data shows that inflation in the US has cooled off, meaning the Fed might soon pivot from its aggressive regime. In the following lines, we will observe how such a measure might impact the prices of some of the leading cryptocurrencies.




Bitcoin (BTC)
The largest digital asset in terms of market capitalization may significantly benefit once the Fed lowers interest rates. The move would make money borrowing easier, which might translate into increased interest in risk-on assets such as BTC. For its part, the potential flow of fresh capital into the asset can result in a surging price. 
The above is increasingly true now, following the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in 2024. This provides retail investors with familiar and comprehensive financial instruments to receive direct exposure to the price of BTC without having to worry about all the technicalities associated with storing it.
One famous person who believes BTC’s price will take off once the Fed pivots is Mike Novogratz. Until then, he sees the asset trading in the $55,000-$75,000 range.
Solana (SOL)
SOL experienced impressive price growth in the past year, briefly exceeding the $200 mark for the first time since December 2021.
SOL Price, Source: CoinGecko
Currently, the asset trades at around $177 (per CoinGecko’s data), a staggering 780% increase compared to the figure observed in May last year.
Solana’s ecosystem has witnessed significant activity. DefiLlama data shows that the total value locked on Solana stands at over $4.8 billion, while on-chain trading volume has been hovering around $1 billion for the past few months.
Solana is home to many retail investors because of its faster transaction times and cheap fees, creating grounds for potential increases should interest rate cuts start heating up the risk-on market.
Dogecoin (DOGE) and Dogwifhat (WIF)
Meme coins are often the cryptocurrency industry’s most volatile asset in the case of ground-breaking events. The leading asset of that type—Dogecoin (DOGE)—and the sensation built on the Solana blockchain—dogwifhat (WIF)—will definitely be worth watching should the Fed switch its strategy.
Both assets have devoted community bases, receiving support from prominent figures and leading cryptocurrency exchanges, and have been the subject of massive hype. 
DOGE is Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s favorite digital asset. Not long ago, the EV giant officially introduced the token as a payment method. For its part, WIF received backing from BitMEX’s co-founder Arthur Hayes.
Ethereum (ETH)
Another asset worth observing in the event of a Fed pivot is the second-largest by market cap: Ethereum (ETH). Its price has previously spiked following announcements that inflation in the US was cooling off or disclosures that interest rates would remain untouched (instead of raised).
For example, ETH has jumped by almost 10% since May 15 – the day when the US Bureau of Labor Statistics released the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. Recall that total CPI clocked in at 3.4%, which is exactly what the expectations were.

ETH Price, Source: CoinGecko
Polkadot (DOT)
This popular blockchain protocol has completed numerous updates as of late, and as such, is also worth watching in case of increased volatility. Most recently, the team behind it enabled Asynchronous Backing on the network. It is an optimization technique designed to improve the process of parachain block production and inclusion in the Relay chain (the main chain of Polkadot).
Polkadot also unveiled the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) Gray Paper. It is a technical upgrade whose goal is to create a more efficient, secure, and scalable blockchain environment that integrates the best aspects of both Polkadot and Ethereum technologies.
Its price has been confined within a very tight range throughout the past few months, which is usually a precursor to considerable volatility. If the Fed decides to cut rates, this volatility might kick in, triggering a considerable move in Polkadot’s price.

Crypto Personality Thomas John Sfraga Pleads Guilty to $1.3 Million Ponzi Scheme



                    

Cryptocurrency personality Thomas John Sfraga has pleaded guilty to wire fraud, admitting to deceiving more than a dozen victims into investing in fictitious ventures, including fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes.



“Sfraga convinced a victim to invest in a fictitious cryptocurrency ‘virtual wallet,’” the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) declared in a May 17 statement. 




The agency elaborated that Sfraga has experience in podcasting and the crypto industry, including hosting crypto events in New York.



“He promised the victims returns on their investments as high as 60% in three months,” the DOJ added. However,



Sfraga was operating a Ponzi scheme, where returns paid to earlier investors came not from legitimate profits but from the investments of new participants.




“In reality, however, Sfraga converted the monies to his own benefit, to pay expenses, and to pay earlier victims and business associates,” the DOJ explained. 



Several of Sfraga’s victims were reportedly friends and neighbors, whose trust he betrayed to “swindle over $1.3 million of their hard-earned savings.”

Such gains are not unusual in the crypto market — Bitcoin rose 65% over three months this year from Jan. 24 to April 24, according to CoinMarketCap data. 




At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $66,860. Several altcoins have seen much larger returns over the same period — Pepe and Dogwifhat (WIF) rose by 722% and 656%, respectively.



This case follows a series of crackdowns on cryptocurrency fraud. 



On May 15, Cointelegraph reported that the DOJ charged brothers Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. 



The brothers allegedly obtained $25 million in cryptocurrency in approximately 12 seconds using a scheme that undermined the integrity of the blockchain.



Just a month earlier, on April 4, the former head of legal and compliance for the multibillion-dollar OneCoin fraud scheme was sentenced to four years in jail after admitting she helped launder millions of dollars.

Crypto Analyst Predicts Ethereum Season, Says Solana Following in Footsteps of ETH’s 2021 Market Cycle - The Daily Hodl


								A popular crypto analyst says that it’s likely Ethereum’s (ETH) time to shine and that its biggest rival is in for a parabolic run.
Pseudonymous trader Inmortal tells his 213,900 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum will rally and leave many traders on the sidelines.










The analyst lays out an initial target of about $4,000 with a chart suggesting that ETH found support at around the $2,800 level.
“ETH season about to start.
Fueled by disbelief, as all the other times.”
Source: Inmortal/X
At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $3,107.
The analyst also has his eye on Ethereum rival Solana (SOL). According to Inmortal, Solana has so far resembled Ethereum’s 2021 market cycle, and if SOL were to continue, it could be trading well above the $360 mark later this year.
“ETH 2021 vs SOL 2024”
Source: Inmortal/X
SOL is trading at $177.54 at time of writing.
Looking at Bitcoin (BTC), Inmortal says that the crypto king is currently in a range between $74,000 and $56,000. If BTC manages to convincingly hold the $66,000 level, the trader says that another run-up to all-time highs is possible.
“BTC KEY levels.
Price rejected at first level of resistance (mid-range)
> IF price manages to reclaim mid-range, THEN range high ($74,000) is on the table.
> Below blue box = bad
Very simple.”
Source: Inmortal/X
At time of writing, BTC is trading at $67,024, slightly above Inmortal’s mid-range.

Gnosis Price Soars 20% After $30Milliopn Buyback Proposal


The price of Gnosis native token, GNO, surged 20% after Thanefield Capital announced a proposed $30 million buyback program.
Holding significant amounts of GNO, this crypto fund plans a large-scale buyback to realign the token’s market value with its intrinsic book value.
$30 Million Buyback Proposal Details

Thanefield Capital proposed that Gnosis DAO deploy $30 million from its treasury over six months. This initiative aims to boost the GNO token’s value, which the fund argues is currently undervalued. According to Thanefield, Gnosis holds $630 million in non-GNO liquid assets and $100 million in venture capital investments. In contrast, GNO’s market capitalization is approximately $424 million, based on its circulating supply of 1.53 million tokens.

The proposal has received preliminary support from the Gnosis community, with 12 out of 14 governance forum voters in favor. Gnosis co-founder Martin Köppelmann endorsed the proposal, emphasizing the need to link the buyback to a growth program.

“I favor this proposal if it connects to a growth program where the GNO acquired in the buyback is consequently used to attract more users,” Köppelmann commented.

If approved, the buyback program will follow a two-pronged strategy. The first approach, the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) strategy, will allocate $15 million to purchase GNO tokens over six months, aiming to exert a daily buy pressure of approximately $83,333. The second approach is discretionary, allocating another $15 million to optimize purchases based on market conditions. Karpatkey, an on-chain asset management project, will manage the buyback.
Gnosis DAO’s Financial Landscape

Gnosis DAO manages various initiatives, including the Gnosis Chain and CoW Protocol. It also has a significant stake in Safe, an Ethereum multisig provider. Despite these assets and previous buyback rounds, GNO’s market value has not reflected these successes. Thanefield Capital noted that long-term GNO holders have not benefited financially from Gnosis DAO’s product developments, venture investments, and treasury management.
Top DAOs by Treasury Size. Source: CryptoDep
As of May 20, approximately 50,000 DAOs collectively hold $30 billion in assets. Gnosis ranks as the 5th largest DAO in terms of treasury size, holding over $630 million in assets, second only to Mantle in non-native marketable tokens.
Since the proposal’s announcement, Gnosis’ token price peaked at $320, a 20% increase, and is currently trading around $308. If implemented, the program could realign GNO’s market value with its intrinsic worth, benefiting long-term holders and enhancing market perception.

Peter Brandt Urges to Ignore Peter Schiff's 'Bitcoin Is Dead' Claim, Half Trillion SHIB Moved in 24 Hours, 7,000 ETH Mysteriously Moved to Robinhood: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


Let’s take a closer look into the past weekend's top three news stories presented to you by U.Today.Legendary trader Peter Brandt reveals what's behind "Bitcoin is dead" claim of Peter SchiffFollowing Bitcoin's recent 9.3% price increase to $67,000, Peter Schiff, seasoned economist known for his critical sentiment toward crypto, took to X platform to share his skepticism regarding the significance of BTC's recovery. Schiff stated that since early April, silver managed to gain more than 21%, while the flagship crypto - only 2% over the same period. He then deemed Bitcoin a failed investment and said it is "dead," claiming that silver offers higher returns. Schiff's statement caught the eye of veteran trader Peter Brandt; he urged to ignore Schiff's comments, arguing that "this type of nonsense" is aimed at attracting attention and followers rather than truly understanding the situation. Brandt believes that Schiff, despite all his criticism, understands the value of crypto, but because of his rooted preferences, would rather support silver. In response, Schiff wrote that he is being honest about his view on BTC. He compared betting on Bitcoin to betting on an "imaginary horse," warning investors against this as they could suffer significant losses.Half trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 24 hours: Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) hiding something?Recent on-chain data demonstrates that over the course of the previous 24 hours, Shiba Inu witnessed another spike of activity on the market, with various entities, including crypto exchanges and whales, actively shifting their SHIB holdings. For instance, 45.01 billion SHIB worth $1.13 million were transferred from one Robinhood hot wallet to another. Also, a Symbolic Capital Partners MEV Bot carried out a number of transactions, each comprising roughly 50 billion SHIB, with values ranging from $1.23 million to $1.26 million per transaction. Likewise, Uniswap experienced significant volume, with transactions of 50.8 billion SHIB ($1.26 million) and 50.4 billion SHIB ($1.23 million) recorded. This increased activity aligns with the on-chain data, revealing that there were 86 large transactions, totaling approximately 1.14 trillion SHIB, in the previous 24 hours. Large transfer volumes and a recent spike in whale transactions could portend a major price change or an imminent breakout. At the moment of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002394, down 0.95% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.Mysterious 7,000 ETH move to Robinhood as Ethereum tops $3,000According to data provided by Whale Alert crypto tracker, on May 17, an unknown wallet transferred 7,000 ETH worth $21,630,557 to Robinhood. The transaction occurred as Ethereum's price surged over the $3,000 price mark, surpassing the psychological barrier. Market participants have been speculating about the reasons behind this significant shift and its possible effects on the market. The transfer might be a precursor to a more significant market move as investors position themselves ahead of the Ethereum ETF decision. According to another theory, a whale, or large holder, may be using Robinhood's platform for trading or custodial purposes since one of the reasons tokens are moved to exchanges is for sale. A plausible explanation could be that the transfer is meant to bolster liquidity on Robinhood’s platform. Yet, the true reason for the move remains unknown. At press time, Ethereum is changing hands at $3,087, up by 0.38% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.

Ethereum clears THIS key hurdle: What’s next for ETH’s price? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum’s price only moved marginally in the last 24 hours. 
Market indicators hinted that Ethereum’s bull rally might resume soon.

Ethereum [ETH] successfully broke above a bullish falling wedge pattern a few days ago. Since then, the king of altcoins has been on track and has earned investors profit. 
If the trend lasts, then ETH has a long way to go. 
Ethereum bulls are slowing down
World Of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting how ETH managed to break out of a falling wedge pattern. 
The token’s price has consolidated inside the pattern since March and finally broke out a few days ago. Since then, ETH seemed to be on the right track, as its price increased by almost 5%. 
However, this gain could just be the beginning, as the breakout has the potential to push ETH’s price by 45%. However, the last few hours showcased less volatility, which somewhat paused ETH’s gaining spree. 
According to CoinMarketCap, ETH’s price only moved up marginally in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,131.77 with a market capitalization of over $376 billion. 
To see whether this sluggish 24-hour price action could lead to a price correction, AMBCrypto checked Ethereum’s on-chain metrics. 
Our analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed that ETH’s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven days’ average. 
This meant that selling pressure on ETH was low. Additionally, both its Transfer Volume and Active Addresses remained high, which was an optimistic sign.
Source: CryptoQuant
Troubles still persist for Ethereum
Though the aforementioned metrics looked promising, a few of the others raised concerns. AMBCrypto’s look at Glassnode’s data revealed that ETH’s NVT ratio had increased sharply over the last few days. 
For the uninitiated, the NVT ratio is computed by dividing the market cap by the transferred on-chain volume, measured in USD.
 A rise in the metric meant that ETH was overvalued, which indicated a possible price correction soon.
Source: Glassnode
Apart from this, another key indicator looked bearish. Ethereum’s fear and greed index had a value of 83% at press time, meaning that the market was in an “extreme fear” phase. 
Whenever the metric hits such levels, it suggests that an asset’s price has high chances of dropping.
 Therefore, AMBCrypto planned to check ETH’s daily chart to better understand whether a price correction was around the corner.

The MACD displayed a bullish crossover. Additionally, ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick from the neutral mark. Its Money Flow Index (MFI) also followed a similar trend. 
These indicated that the chances of a major price correction were slim.

Dogecoin Forms Symmetrical Triangle, Rally On The Horizon?


																Amidst a significant surge displayed by Dogecoin (DOGE) recently, popular crypto analyst Crypto Daily Trade Signals has identified a symmetrical triangle pattern in the price movements of the crypto asset, indicating a possible continuation of the present rising trend. Based on the expert analysis, Dogecoin, which has attracted a lot of attention and interest from investors lately, may be preparing to build on its current momentum and make more gains.
Significance Of Dogecoin Symmetrical Triangle Pattern
A symmetrical triangle chart pattern is a consolidation phase that precedes a forced breakout or decline in price. A new bearish trend begins with a breakdown from the lower trend line, while a new bullish trend begins with a breakout from the upper trend line.

According to the analyst, the symmetrical triangle pattern presents a major obstacle for DOGE at the $0.1545 price level. At the same time, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) continues to provide support at the $0.1513 level.
Even though the current market price is above the 50 EMA and suggests a bullish bias, Crypto Daily Trade Signals noted that Dogecoin has to surpass the resistance level of $0.1595 in order to confirm that the upward trend is continuing.

This perspective is further strengthened by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is currently above the 50 EMA and supports a purchasing trend.
The post read:
Dogecoin has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, presenting a significant hurdle around the $0.1545 mark. Simultaneously, support persists around the $0.1513 level, reinforced by the 50-day EMA.
The expert highlighted that DOGE is at a pivotal point around $0.15100 on the 4-hour chart, indicating a bullish momentum, and an immediate resistance at the $0.15950 mark. The first obstacle to be cleared is the immediate resistance at $0.15950, which is followed by the $0.16980 and $0.18440 levels.
Although caution is advised if DOGE drops below the pivot point, the RSI’s current position indicates an opportunity for more profits. Thus far, the upward trend is supported by a firm base provided by the 50-day EMA around $0.15130.
Meanwhile, on the negative side, $0.14270 provides immediate support, while $0.13240 and $0.12030 provide additional levels of support, with the RSI at 53, which denotes neutral conditions.
Is $12 DOGE Possible?
Crypto analyst Javin Marks has also shared insights on Dogecoin’s recent price action, predicting a potential massive rally to $12. According to the expert, based on previous breakouts and runs, DOGE has maintained its broken status once more.

These runs have become bigger one after the other, and the last run recorded over 20,000% upsurge. Given the nature of the runs, Javon Marks anticipates the recent run, which might be in its early stage now, to be bigger than the last one.
As a result, the expert experts DOGE to reach $12 or even higher following the run. Also, Marks noted that after the run has concluded, DOGE could see another massive rise of over 7,500%.

                        The Blockchain Association urged a full House floor vote of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) in a Monday letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.Blockchain Association Pushes House Floor Vote For FIT21
FIT21 (also known as H.R. 4763) is expected to be voted on in the chamber sometime this week. Its potential passage in both the House and the Senate would mark the first time the U.S. has seen crypto-oriented regulation.The letter, undersigned by crypto heavyweights including Ripple, Kraken, and Circle, pushes for a House vote on the legislation, citing the need for “legislation that offers a framework for innovation, regulatory clarity for U.S. operators, and protection for users and consumers.”“Since the inception of the Bitcoin network in 2009, the blockchain and digital asset industry has existed without targeted market regulation,” the letter to Jeffries and Johnson read. “The absence of clear rules leads to confusion in the marketplace for companies – and leaves users and consumers unprotected.U.S. Under Fire For Unclear Crypto Regulations
U.S. regulators have been scrutinized for their treatment of the crypto sector. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is often criticized for its regulation-by-enforcement approach.Critics claim that the stringent anti-crypto atmosphere may drive American businesses overseas and stifle the country’s technological advancement.“This lack of clarity impedes innovation and hamstrings companies, harming America’s standing in the global technology race,” the Blockchain Association’s letter continued. “We are seeking pro-innovation and pro-consumer guardrails to ensure a fair and safe marketplace and to safeguard U.S. technological leadership in this cutting edge space.”If passed, FIT21 would see the majority responsibility of digital asset regulation delegated to the Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC) while increasing legal protections for consumers of crypto.Congressional Momentum Around Crypto Builds After SAB121 Resolution
News of Monday’s letter comes amid increasing momentum for effective crypto legislation following Congress’ approval of a resolution that would potentially remove the SEC’s controversial accounting bulletin, SAB121, from its guidance.Previously, President Joe Biden alleged that he would ultimately veto the attempt to disavow SAB121, citing “substantial financial instability and market uncertainty” should he sign off on the resolution.The strong bipartisan support against the SEC’s crypto guidance may force Biden to rethink his stance, however.Should Fit21 follow suit, it could signal a new era of digital asset regulation across the United States, with greater freedoms allotted to players in the crypto space.

Two FED Members Talked About Inflation and Interest Rate Cuts: While One Gave a Message of Disappointment, the Other Gave a Date for the First Interest Rate Cut! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While Bitcoin rose after the US data announced last week, the latest inflation data balanced the worsening situation.
Following these economic data, two FED members spoke on the first day of the week.


Making statements about the course of inflation and the FED's monetary policy, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Fed Vice President for Supervision Michael Barr evaluated the data.
FED member Bostic spoke first and stated that inflation would eventually reach the 2% target and that it would take some time.





Stating that the FED is not yet in a position to signal a return on interest rates, that is, to reduce them, Bostic stated that when the time comes, they will reduce interest rates, as other major central banks are currently doing.
Highlights from Bostic's statement are as follows:



“Inflation data is very up and down.
My prediction is that inflation will continue to fall this year and next year. But we still have a long way to go when it comes to inflation.
FED is open to all possibilities on the economic path. Our policy stance is restrictive.
The risks are really balanced right now.
As data continues to be volatile, prices will fall at a slower pace than many expect. “It will take a little longer than expected for this downward momentum to be reflected in the economy.”

Finally, Bostic stated that there was no change in the FED's forecast regarding interest policy and said that he expected an interest rate cut in the October-December quarter this year.
Data Disappointing!
After FED member Bostic, Michael Barr also evaluated the inflation data and said that the US inflation data for the first quarter of 2024 was “disappointing”.





Considering these data, Barr stated that the FED still cannot find the evidence it needs to loosen monetary policy, and stated that the FED will continue to wait to reduce interest rates.

“The FED will wait a little longer for the interest rate cuts that the markets are eagerly awaiting. The FED will remain on hold until it becomes clear that inflation will return to 2 percent, which is our final target.
“The Fed's policy is restrictive enough for now, and we'll need to give it some more time for our restrictive policy to continue working.”

                        BitFuFu Inc., a rapidly growing digital asset mining service and cloud-mining provider, announced stellar financial results for the first quarter of 2024. The company’s innovative cloud mining solutions and self-mining operations are firing on all cylinders, propelling revenues and profits.The company reported an impressive 149% year-over-year spike in total revenue to $144.4 million, driven by explosive growth in its cloud-mining solutions and self-mining operations. BitFuFu Cloud-Mining Making the MostTotal revenue skyrocketed 149% year-over-year to $144.4 million, beyond expectations. Profit figures were even more massive as its net income exploded more than 12-fold to $35.3 million, while adjusted EBITDA rocketed up 431% to $49.9 million. The company’s cloud mining drove this phenomenal performance. Revenue from this high-growth segment nearly tripled to $81.5 million as BitFuFu’s user base surged 63.5% to over 321,000 registered miners worldwide. Customers flocked to the platform’s unique ability to purchase hashrate at fixed prices, providing downside protection amid crypto market turbulence.According to CEO Leo Lu, BitFuFu’s “asset-light strategy” underpins these massive synergies by allowing ultra-nimble optimization of mining rigs and hashrate deployment. “Our cloud-mining solutions allow us to reduce revenue volatility…and significantly strengthen cash flow by pre-selling hashrate at a fixed price,” he explained.However, the cloud business was part of BitFuFu’s multifaceted success story last quarter. Its self-mining operations also delivered a blistering 117% revenue jump to $60.1 million. While bitcoin production slipped 11% due to high network difficulty, this decline was overwhelmed by a 70% hashrate increase and a 134% surge in average BTC prices.Combined, these two engines powered a cash hoard of $163.7 million on BitFuFu’s balance sheet by the quarter’s end—more than double the prior period.BitFuFu Listing on NASDAQ
Looking ahead, BitFuFu is doubling down on its unique hybrid model spanning cloud offerings and self-mining. Lu highlighted plans to acquire existing facilities or construct new ones to “optimize our cost structure and capital allocation even further and expand our bottom line.”With a rapidly expanding global footprint of 29 mining sites across three continents, BitFuFu has swiftly transcended its origins and demonstrated incredibly well as Bitmain’s cloud partner. The crypto mining company further bolstered its war chest by raising funds through a NASDAQ listing in March. The company filed an F-4 form with the SEC on December 31 to register its securities for the merger as a foreign private entity, which the SEC declared effective. BitFuFu was listed on the Nasdaq exchange under the ” FUFU ” ticker symbol following its SPAC merger acquisition. It aims for a third-quarter debut with an anticipated enterprise value of nearly $1.5 billion.The F-4 filing revealed strong financials, with BitFuFu reporting $134 million in revenue for the first half of 2023 and an operating hashrate of 15.2 EH/s, though nearly 80% of the hashing power came from miners leased from Bitmain. Bitmain holds a 5% equity stake in BitFuFu and is a significant supplier, with $90 million of BitFuFu’s revenue allocated to Bitmain for miner leasing and hosting fees.As of March 31, 2024, the company held cash, cash equivalents, and digital assets totaling US$163.7 million, up from US$76.0 million on December 31, 2023. This increase is primarily attributed to funds raised from its business combination and NASDAQ listing in March 2024, along with a fair value gain on BTC due to rising BTC prices.

Dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces a critical juncture in its price action. The market is on high alert as a colossal amount of 58 trillion SHIB becomes the center of a fierce tug-of-war between bullish and bearish forces.After several days of attempting to surpass the daily SMA 50 barrier at $0.0000247, Shiba Inu succumbed to bears, retreating to lows of $0.00002352 in today's trading session.At the time of writing, SHIB was down 0.65% in the last 24 hours to $0.000024, suggesting an ongoing battle between bulls and bears.According to IntoTheBlock data, 58.18 trillion SHIB were bought by 57,380 addresses in Shiba Inu's current trading range between $0.000023 and $0.000025 at an average price of $0.000024.This threshold has emerged as a battleground where the short-term trajectory of SHIB's value might be determined. Bulls, optimistic traders betting on the price increase, are rallying to defend this level, hoping to spark a price increase for SHIB price. On the other side, bears, the pessimists of the market, are pushing back, aiming to drive the price down and capitalize on a potential decline.The significance of the 58 trillion SHIB threshold cannot be overstated, representing a point of convergence for market forces and investor sentiment. A strong defense of this level by the bulls could signal renewed confidence in the token's potential, suggesting that SHIB could be gearing up for a price increase.Conversely, if the bears manage to breach this threshold, it could indicate a loss of support for SHIB, potentially leading to a decline in price. Such a scenario would affect the immediate market value of SHIB.In the event of a price rebound, a successful breach of the daily SMA 50 might be needed to kickstart a fresh uptrend for SHIB price, with targets on $0.000032 or even $0.000045. On the other hand, if bears gain the upper hand, Shiba Inu might persist in its current range with support at $0.000018 and $0.00002.

Roaring Kitty Returns: GameStop Up, But Whale Rains on PEPE Parade


							

Meme stocks surge: GME up 50%, PEPE sees smaller gains



GameStop investor “Roaring Kitty” returns, sparking interest



Whale transaction on PEPE raises concerns of price volatility




Meme stocks experienced a resurgence in the last 24 hours, with both GameStop (GME) and Pepe (PEPE) registering notable price movements. GME surged by nearly 50% to $0.007729, accompanied by a trading volume of $84.5 million. PEPE, on the other hand, saw a more modest uptick of 0.26%, reaching $0.000009 with a significantly higher trading volume of $847.5 million.



Renewed interest in GameStop emerged after the return of Keith Gill, a retail investor known online as “The Roaring Kitty,” who played a pivotal role in the company’s stock surge in 2021. Gill’s return to the spotlight rekindled investor interest, prompting some to revisit their investment strategies from the previous year.



For GME, technical indicators present a mixed picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 52.58, suggesting a neutral market sentiment, neither overbought nor oversold. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) hints at a potential bullish reversal, suggesting that the stock may be oversold and poised for a price increase. Traders should consider both indicators alongside broader market conditions when making investment decisions.

Similarly, PEPE’s RSI of 57.99 also indicates a neutral market position, suggesting that traders should wait for confirmation before making any moves. Notably, PEPE’s MACD value of 0.00000068 suggests a relatively low price level, potentially presenting a buying opportunity as the price rises.







Source: TradingView



However, recent on-chain data for PEPE reveals a potential complication arising from a large transaction. A multi-signature wallet deposited a substantial amount of PEPE tokens, valued at approximately $4.54 million, onto the Binance exchange.



This move, which may be a stop-loss measure, triggered a temporary price dip of 6% for PEPE. The wallet in question has a history of poor trading decisions, having lost nearly $717,000 (approximately 4.69%) in the past two weeks from separate PEPE trades. Historically, large whale transactions have often been associated with sharp price declines when significant quantities of PEPE are moved. This move led to a 6% price drop in PEPE, as this particular whale has a history of poor trading decisions. It lost $717,000 (approximately 4.69%) in the past 15 days from two separate PEPE trades.







Historically, whale transactions have often caused sharp price declines whenever large amounts of PEPE were moved.

Is it better to invest in gold or Bitcoin?


    Both gold and Bitcoin (BTC) have their niche roles in investing. Gold has little practical use besides jewelry and certain specialized electronics, while Bitcoin has virtually none (pun intended). That said, investors still seek them out, primarily as an alternative to fiat currency. Furthermore, both assets have surged recently, setting their respective price records in 2024. However, is it better to invest in gold or Bitcoin? We’ll try to find out in this article. 



Why would anyone invest in gold or Bitcoin?



Now that’s a good question.



Both financial assets remain in an awkward position in today’s economy. While the gold standard was vital to global finances from the 1870s to the 1920s, and gold was used as a currency for millennia, you probably won’t see a vendor accept a piece of gold as payment today.







On the other hand, Bitcoin is a relatively novel asset that promises to replace the current system ruled by excessive centralization and regulation by central banks and governments. It has yet to fulfill that promise, though: despite a growing number of vendors accepting it, the vast majority of the world still conducts business with fiat currencies.



Seemingly in defiance of logic, both assets are experiencing staggering demand, with gold setting a record high of nearly $2,441 on May 20, 2024, and Bitcoin exceeding $73,000 in March 2024.



So, why is that?



Investors perceive gold and Bitcoin as safe-haven financial instruments in the case of a failing dollar or an incoming recession. In fact, both assets remain attractive, particularly because they are “immune” to government interventions. 



Unlike fiat currency, which you can always print more of, both gold and Bitcoin are limited in supply and thus have the potential to act as a hedge against inflation.



Gold and Bitcoin as inflation hedges



Gold has built a reputation for doing well when the economy doesn’t. In fact, gold has historically been used to store value. The logic behind gold’s ability to counter inflation is that investors turn from stocks to gold when the economy is under threat, increasing demand and price. Once the economy recovers, demand for gold falls as investors return to stocks, creating an “inverse” trajectory.



Despite being several millennia younger than its shinier counterpart, Bitcoin has some similarities to gold in this “inverse trajectory” aspect. After all, its supply is similarly finite, and its allure also increases when conventional assets like stocks decline. The COVID-19 pandemic sort of validated this role, as the price of Bitcoin soared during the global crisis and peaked in November 2021. 



Gold vs. Bitcoin



It might seem unfair to compare a commodity almost as old as civilization to a digital currency that gained traction only several years ago. Still, in their competition to occupy the position of the premium hedge against inflation, they show crucial differences that can help us decide which one we prefer.



1. Price volatility



Having thousands of years to stabilize your price tends to favor gold. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s price remains notoriously unstable, as is the price of all cryptocurrencies. 



According to Curvo, in the last ten years, the gold spot price index provided an annual return of 6% on average, with a relatively steady curve on the performance chart.

On the other hand, the same source provides data that shows that Bitcoin returned 63.3% yearly on average for the last decade, but the price varied wildly, with extreme dips and spikes in its price that reflect “crypto winters” and rushes in demand.

As Bitcoin gets further integrated into the global economy, its price will likely grow due to increased demand. While this price appreciation is not relevant to its ability to act as a hedge against inflation, it is definitely attractive to long-term growth investors. 




2. Safety & regulations



As an established commodity and value keeper, gold is impossible to counterfeit. As it is usually stored in banks, it is also extremely difficult to steal. Carrying gold across the border requires permission from the authorities, and you can generally purchase gold from registered dealers and brokers only. Storing physical gold as an investor, however, is not an ideal solution due to safety concerns. 



Bitcoin is similarly hard to counterfeit due to blockchain technology and commonly available ledgers that can track transactions and keep precise records. It remains decentralized and thus easier to make transactions with, but there are no regulatory bodies to ensure customer safety and prevent clandestine activities. In fact, storing Bitcoin is best with dedicated crypto wallets. 



3. Application & utility



Gold has almost no utility outside the jewelry industry and very niche applications, such as in specialized electronics. Therefore, its demand remains tied to its value storage and inflation hedge purposes. This lack of utility suits the fact that its price is independent of economic cycles, but it also means that gold does not benefit from global economic growth. 



Likewise, Bitcoin also has limited utility. It still has no use outside its speculative investment and as a digital currency. That said, several emerging technologies could see more use for Bitcoin, especially within the fintech and decentralized finance (DeFi) domains. There are no guarantees for this, however, and until these technologies fully develop, Bitcoin will likely stick to its current role.



Is it better to invest in gold or Bitcoin – the bottom line



Gold’s historical role has cemented its position as a value storage and a hedge against inflation. On the other hand, Bitcoin will need more exposure to history before its volatility gets low enough and investors’ trust matches that of gold. 



On the plus side, Bitcoin’s volatility leaves room for price appreciation, and in the last ten years, the famous cryptocurrency has provided significant returns for its investors on average. Historical performance of this scale, however, should not be trusted as an indicator of the future. 



Experts still recommend that gold positions in serious investing portfolios be limited to 10% of total portfolio value. If you invest in Bitcoin for similar purposes, a 10% cap could also apply to the cryptocurrency.



Conversely, stocks, particularly the S&P 500 index, are better than either gold, silver, or cryptocurrency and remain the safest hedge against inflation in the long run.  At least until cryptocurrency passes a couple of decades’ test of time and potentially proves otherwise.

In the past 24 hours, Dogecoin (DOGE), the most popular meme cryptocurrency, has been witness to worrying on-chain developments. According to data provided by IntoTheBlock, there has been a notable decline of almost 86% in the Large Holders Inflow metric. This metric tracks the movement of funds into addresses held by large investors, or whales.Large Holders Inflow fell from 428.72 million DOGE to 62.63 million DOGE, equating to approximately $9.45 million. Such a decrease indicates a substantial reduction in buying activity among these major stakeholders. Typically, a decrease in this metric suggests a decrease in purchasing activity, as many large holders tend to acquire assets on centralized exchanges before transferring them to cold storage.Source: IntoTheBlockAdditionally, Large Holders Netflow, which provides insight into the position changes of whales and investors holding over 0.1% of the supply, has seen a significant decline. Last week, it entered positive territory at 411.69 million DOGE but has since fallen to 31.71 million DOGE. This shift in netflow suggests a change in sentiment among large players, potentially indicating reduced positions or selling.What about Dogecoin (DOGE) price?Simultaneously, Dogecoin's price has seen mixed trends over the past day, with a loss of 2.57% recorded yesterday and a further 1.46% decline today. Presently, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.152 per DOGE.DOGE to USD by CoinMarketCapThe implications of the decrease in whale activity on the price of Dogecoin dynamics are worth noting. Historically, the actions of large holders have had a significant impact on market movements. Therefore, the sudden decline in whale activity could lead to increased market volatility or signal changes in sentiment among institutional investors.

italik Buterin's Insights: Addressing Ethereum's Centralization Risks


Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, recently addressed key decentralization challenges facing the Ethereum network in a detailed blog post.
Buterin’s insights focus on three critical areas: Miner Extractable Value (MEV), staking complexities, and hardware requirements for running nodes. He emphasized that while concerns about Ethereum’s design are “widely shared,” these issues might be easier to resolve than some suggest.
Mitigating MEV

MEV refers to the profit block producers can gain by reordering, including, or excluding transactions within a block. MEV allows those who produce Ethereum blocks to manipulate transactions for extra profit. 
This manipulation can make the system unfair, giving an advantage to those with more resources and technical know-how. It undermines trust in the network, making it harder for more minor participants to compete. Buterin outlines two primary approaches to mitigate MEV: minimization and quarantining.
MEV minimization reduces unfair value extraction through protocols like CowSwap, promoting fair trading. Encrypted transaction pools (mempools) prevent exploitation by hiding transaction details until they are confirmed. This approach allows all participants, regardless of resources or technical skills, to engage fairly, enhancing trust and decentralization in the network.
Read more: What Is Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)? 

MEV quarantining limits the impact of MEV by separating the roles of validators and block builders through Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS). This setup means that those proposing transactions do not have the power to include them in blocks, reducing the risk of value extraction. Vitalik also suggested that inclusion lists, which mandate certain transactions in a block, could be a solution.

“We need to make the ‘MEV quarantine box’ as small as possible,” Buterin wrote.

Inclusion Lists. Source: ethresear.ch
Ethereum Staking Complexities
Solo staking on Ethereum currently demands a minimum of 32 ETH and significant technical expertise. This requirement leads many to use services like Lido and RocketPool, risking decentralization.
Buterin proposed a few solutions to reduce hardware and data storage needs for nodes. Technologies like Verkle trees and EIP-4444 could reduce storage needs to less than 100 gigabytes, making it feasible for nodes to run on personal devices. He also suggested lowering the 32 ETH minimum for staking.

Ethereum’s co-founder envisions a future where even browser extension wallets could operate nodes. However, he acknowledges the challenge that offloading data storage responsibilities might centralize trust to a few large actors.

“Incorrect answers could lead Ethereum down a path of centralization and ‘re-creating the traditional financial system with extra steps,'” he warned.

Buterin’s call to action is clear: respect Ethereum’s unique properties and continue improving them as the network scales. By addressing MEV, simplifying staking, and reducing node hardware requirements, Ethereum aims to enhance its decentralization and resilience.

Crypto investment inflows soar to $932 million after favorable CPI report

Digital asset investment products inflows jumped by 616% week-on-week to $932 million last week, according to CoinShares’ weekly report.This marks the second consecutive week of inflows this month and a return to the impressive numbers recorded during the early period of this year.James Butterfill, CoinShares’ head of research, explained that the substantial inflows were “an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI (Consumer Price Index) report.” He added:“The latter 3 trading days of the week [made] up 89% of the total flows, highlighting our view that Bitcoin prices have recoupled to interest rate expectations.”However, trading volumes remained subdued despite the significant flows. Butterfill wrote:“Despite the pickup in inflows, volumes were only $10.5 billion for the week in comparison to $40 billion in March.”Grayscale sees rare inflow in dominant USThe CoinShares report showed that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US continued with their impressive numbers, propelling inflows in the country to more than $1 billion last week.Interestingly, Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF GBTC saw a rare week of inflow, amounting to $18 million during the reporting period.Since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the ETFs for trading in January, GBTC has recorded substantial outflows totaling more than $16 billion from its “expensive” product as investors exited to cheaper rival options like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC.Meanwhile, the newly launched ETFs in Hong Kong are not drawing investors’ interest as anticipated. According to CoinShares data, approximately $83 million were withdrawn from crypto-related investments in the City-State.Investors dump EthereumLast week, Ethereum-based digital asset products recorded their second consecutive week of outflows, totaling $23 million. This brings the cumulative outflows from ETH this month to $47 million.Butterfill explained that these outflows were caused by the bearish sentiments surrounding the possible approval of a spot Ethereum ETF product in the US. The SEC is expected to decide on the pending Ethereum ETF applications from VanEck and ARK Invest by May 23 and 24.However, industry experts generally agree that the financial regulator’s taciturn stance toward the digital asset makes it unlikely to approve the product.Meanwhile, investors continued to show interest in other altcoin investment options. Solana, Chainlink, and Cardano saw inflows totaling $4.9 million, $3.7 million, and $1.9 million, respectively.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Hacker Who Exploited Solana Meme Coin Factory Pump.fun Says He Faces Theft, Conspiracy Charges - Decrypt

The alleged Pump.fun attacker, who stole an estimated $2 million of Solana, claims to have been arrested and charged in relation to the exploit. However, the police do not have a record of any charges matching the time and location the attacker described to Decrypt.Jarett Reginald Dunn (known as Stacc on Twitter) told Decrypt that on Friday, May 17 at around 11:45 p.m., police arrested him not far from the Pump.fun WeWork in Covent Garden, London.He told Decrypt he was charged for “theft from employer for $2 million with conspiracy of another $80 million,” saying the charges were explained to him “over and over.” However, the Metropolitan (MET) Police are unable to find any charges matching this time and location. And, as a matter of policy, the MET Police don’t disclose details about people who were arrested but not charged.Pump.fun is a popular tool that allows users to launch Solana tokens in minutes for only 0.02 SOL ($3). The exploit, executed on Thursday, saw wallet provider Phantom block the site and trading pause across the platform.Within minutes of the attack, Dunn took to Twitter to claim responsibility. He said he was a former Pump.fun employee with a deep disdain for the protocol and that he was not afraid of being imprisoned, especially with his identity being known prior to the attack.Dunn told Decrypt he was been taken to Islington station and held for 20 hours. He claims that he has been released on bail under the conditions that he returns for an interview with the Criminal Investigation Department on Aug 16, as well as refraining from contacting individuals or appearing at locations connected with Pump.fun.The Canadian-national claims that he has now been hospitalized for up to 28 days due to mental health concerns. This came after he raised concerns about his mental health. He told Decrypt that he was then seen by two psychiatrists before being involuntarily hospitalized.“I’ve been hospitalized two of the last three years of my life lol.” Dunn told Decrypt via Twitter DMs, “I am diagnosed [with] schizo-affective bipolar and panic disorder and am medicated ADHD, although no diagnoses. Haven’t had any meds of any kind in about three months.”In the UK, the only way for someone to be removed from the public against their will due to mental health reasons is under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act. It is important to understand that being sectioned under this act is not an arrest, but rather a police power for when a person is in “immediate need of care and control as their behavior is of concern.”Dunn told Decrypt that a number of his phones and MacBooks were seized due to the investigation he says is currently underway. He’s been in touch with Decrypt by using an iPad provided to the hospital where he’s been taken. As a result, he is currently attempting to raise funds to purchase a new phone, laptop, and regain access to his email.In the face of these charges—which have yet to be confirmed by police—Dunn believes that Pump.fun’s case has no legs. That's because the funds were owned by the customers, not the Pump.fun team which, he believes. And that puts him in the clear.Pump.fun did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Three Stocks Most Likely to Hit a $1 Trillion Market Cap in Next 3 Years - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) showed what happens when an established company is agile and quick to follow and push new trends. By supplying high-performance GPUs and harnessing them for ground-breaking AI development, Nvidia cornered another market.



This transition from the discrete GPU market to the infrastructure for generative AI was sufficient to push NVDA stock to the over $1 trillion market cap milestone in May 2023. It only took Nvidia until February 2024 to cross the $2 trillion barrier.



But which other stocks could accomplish the same feat? After all, NVDA shareholders can enjoy 204% returns on a one-year basis alone. Here are some $1 trillion candidates to consider.



Visa (NASDAQ: V)



What Nvidia is for GPUs and AI infrastructure, Visa is for payment processing. It shares a duopoly with MasterCard, while high-growth American Express is in distant third place. As such, investors should view Visa as the main beneficiary in the upcoming transition to digital money.



At the recent Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth and Energy for Development by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Saudi Arabia, prominent speakers reaffirmed the need to go full digital. 




“We’re probably going to stop calling it the central bank digital currency [CBDC]. It’s going to be a digital form of cash, and at some point in time hopefully we will be able to be 100% digital”



Khalid Humaidan, Governor of the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB)




Visa has actively participated in this global monetary transition following the company’s development of the CBDC Payment Module. In January 2022, Visa partnered with ConsenSys to connect different CBDC networks with existing payment rails. This makes Visa integral in bridging the ledgers of central banks and delivering the final digital product (wallet) to the end user.



Notwithstanding that trajectory, Visa’s market cap is steadily increasing. In January 2020, it was $413 billion, and it is now $563 billion. By participating in one of the backbones for global payments, V shareholders can rely on safe growth, benefiting from network effects. 



A recent report from ResearchAndMarkets positions the global payments market to grow at a CAGR of 10.5%, forecasted to reach $4.78 trillion by 2029 from $2.64 trillion in 2023. Moreover, Visa returned $12.7 billion to shareholders in 2023 via stock buybacks. This is in addition to offering dividends, presently at 0.74% yield at $2.08 annual payout per share.



At $280.10 per share at press time, V stock is 23% above its 52-week low of $216.14. According to Nasdaq forecasting, the average V price target twelve months ahead is $316.57.





Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NASDAQ: TSM)



While Nvidia makes specific AI GPUs like A100 and H100, which found themselves across the Magnificent Seven companies, TSMC is the world’s most advanced chip foundry. In other words, TSMC is the layer zero of chip making. 



Although China ramped up its foundry building to circumvent US export controls, its Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) is still lagging behind TSMC. Specifically, the US control grid is hampering Chinese efforts to develop cutting-edge tech, such as gate-all-around (GAAFET) transistors.



Moreover, TSMC’s present 3nm FinFET (N3) technology is the most advanced high-volume semiconductor manufacturing technology. By 2026, the company is set to deliver the 1.6nm process. Taking this into account, TSMC’s global market share is likely to increase further from its present dominant position of nearly 60%, according to Counterpoint. 



For comparison, Samsung is in distant second place at 13%. With the help of the CHIPS Act, previously covered Intel (INTC) aims to take Samsung’s place by 2030. TSMC’s market cap is presently at $796 billion, having grown by 67% over one year.



Notwithstanding black swan events, such as military conflict with China over Taiwan, the average TSM price target is $163.11 vs. the current $151.68 per share. This indicates another all-time high for TSM, up from the previous one of $155.58 on May 15th. 



Such a dynamic is reminiscent of Nvidia’s rise, but the Chinese situation is dampening greater investor interest in TSM. 







MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR)



Perhaps the most clear-cut case for crossing the $1 trillion milestone is Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy. Aggressively hoarding Bitcoin, at 214,400 BTC as of May 1st, Saylor counts on central banks to further debase fiat currencies, using Bitcoin as an exit strategy.



This is not a surprising conclusion given central banks’ penchant to monetize debt perpetually while governments rack up massive budget deficits. The US national debt is currently at $34.7 trillion and continues accelerating. This makes it exceedingly likely that the Federal Reserve will attempt to inflate away the astronomical/unpayable debt.



People will likely safeguard their wealth with Bitcoin (BTC) as they realize this dynamic. Although there are thousands of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin stands apart as the most decentralized and most heavily secured owing to the network effect from Bitcoin’s proof-of-work miners.



In turn, MicroStrategy is a proxy for Bitcoin’s market cap rise, having utilized debt to accumulate scarce bitcoins. The company’s market cap is $29.3 billion, rapidly rising from $3.7 billion in May 2023. Considering that Bitcoin ETFs wildly outperformed gold ETFs, with more funds’ allocations likely incoming, even the baseline forecast of $300,000 per BTC by 2026 would bring Bitcoin’s market cap to nearly $6 trillion.

Cryptic Share from Bitcoin Bull Michael Saylor: BTC Predictions? - Bitcoin Sistemi


A new post came from MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, who expresses his endless trust in Bitcoin in every post and statement.
The last post of Saylor, who posts about BTC almost every day, led to some speculations in the community.


Saylor said, “Keep your eyes on the prize” in his post. It was seen that the Bitcoin image shared by Saylor had the numbers 69 above it and 98 and 89 below it.
The community stated that the post was an encrypted message and interpreted these figures as the expectations of the famous Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor and could be clues about how high Bitcoin could rise soon.







Bullish Expectations for Bitcoin Are Increasing!
Thinking that Bitcoin will continue the upward trend it started last week, 10X Research founder Markus Thielen claimed in his new report that Bitcoin exceeding $ 67,500 could lead to new ATHs.


“A break above $67,500 could trigger a significant rise and potentially lead to new all-time highs,” Thielen said. said.
Apart from this, Santiment analysts also stated that there was a bullish signal for BTC.

UK High Court Judge rules against Craig Wright over Bitcoin copyright claims - CoinJournal



                    

                    The UK High Court has delivered a damning verdict against Craig Wright, a controversial figure claiming to be the elusive creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.
Judge James Mellor, in a written judgment, asserted that Wright had lied “extensively and repeatedly” throughout the trial, further accusing him of presenting “fabricated” evidence to support his claims.
COPA wins against Craig Wright
Judge Mellor’s ruling serves as a culmination of a protracted legal battle that has spanned several years.
The lawsuit, brought forth by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), aimed to challenge Craig Wright’s assertions of ownership over the intellectual rights to Bitcoin’s code and whitepaper.
Wright’s purported attempts to lay claim to these foundational aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem have been met with scepticism and legal resistance from various quarters.
Wright’s litigious nature, characterized by numerous lawsuits against developers and individuals critical of his claims, has raised concerns within the Bitcoin community.
However, Mellor acknowledged the adverse impact of Wright’s aggressive legal strategy on Bitcoin developers, stating that Satoshi Nakamoto, known for a collaborative and non-confrontational approach, would unlikely resort to litigation.
Fabrications and forgeries of documents
The judgment highlighted Wright’s alleged fabrications and forgeries of documents on a significant scale, all in support of his central claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto.
The judge characterized Wright’s actions as “clumsy” and underscored the pivotal role these falsehoods played in shaping the trial’s outcome.
COPA, formed with the primary objective of defending the open nature of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, contested Wright’s assertions, arguing that such claims could stifle innovation and deter developers from contributing to the Bitcoin network.
Throughout the trial, evidence emerged casting doubt on the authenticity of Wright’s claims.
Documents submitted by Wright’s defence purportedly supporting his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto were scrutinized, revealing inconsistencies and anomalies.
Fonts that did not exist at the alleged time of their creation and metadata indicating recent document alterations were among the discrepancies cited in Judge Mellor’s judgment.
Perjury charges loom over Craig Wright
The legal saga surrounding Craig Wright has been closely monitored by the cryptocurrency community, given its potential ramifications for the future of Bitcoin and the broader blockchain space.
While Craig Wright has announced on X that he will be appealing the ruling, the ruling represents a significant setback for his ambitions, with the possibility of perjury charges looming over him.
In response to the verdict, COPA hailed the decision as a victory for open innovation and the principles upon which Bitcoin was founded.
The alliance reiterated its commitment to safeguarding the decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, vowing to continue its efforts to protect against unwarranted copyright claims.

Today’s ruling is the result of a concerted and united effort across the entire open source community – from developers, to those who selflessly contributed to funding this important case, to all members of COPA. THANK YOU ALL for the time, dedication and support.  Your efforts…
— COPA (@opencryptoorg) May 20, 2024

As the dust settles on this legal showdown, the broader implications of Judge Mellor’s ruling reverberate across the cryptocurrency landscape.
The verdict not only underscores the importance of transparency and integrity within the community but also serves as a cautionary tale against attempts to monopolize or control foundational elements of decentralized technologies like Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Miners Targeted by Venezuela in Latest Crypto Crackdown - Decrypt

Venezuelan authorities have launched a crackdown on crypto miners in a bid to protect the South American nation’s power grid. In an Instagram post on Friday, the country’s Department of Energy (Spanish acronym: MPPEE) said that it would disconnect all mining operations from the country’s National Electric System (SEN). Miners are needed to help Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to work as intended. Such operations are often large warehouses full of computers that use a huge amount of energy to mint new digital coins and keep a crypto network secure. However, such operations have come under criticism by lawmakers all over the world for the amount of energy they consume. MPPEE said in its post that the move was being made in a bid to “avoid the high impact on demand” on the grid, and to allow the SEN “to continue offering an efficient and reliable service to all the Venezuelan people.” The post featured a video of authorities raiding what looks like crypto mining operations. Venezuela—which has experienced a devastating economic collapse since 2010—has long suffered problems with its grid. Although the problem isn’t as bad as it was back in 2019, some of the country’s rural areas still experience blackouts.Last September, Venezuelan police raided a prison where inmates were running secret Bitcoin mining operations. And earlier in 2023, the country’s regulator launched a crackdown on miners.Despite this, the country is still keen on using crypto: The state-run oil company, PDVSA,  reportedly wants to use digital asset USDT to exchange for its crude and fuel exports as a way to get around U.S. oil sanctions, Reuters reported last month.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Binance Revamps Crypto Listings: Focus on Fundamentals, Not Hype


							

 Binance starts initiative against inflated token valuations



Exchange seeks projects with strong fundamentals



Initiative aims to protect retail investors




Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has unveiled a new initiative aimed at fostering a more balanced and equitable crypto market environment. The exchange seeks to address a growing concern: token launches with excessively high Fully Diluted Valuations (FDVs) and limited initial circulating supplies.



This strategy involves some projects releasing a small number of tokens at launch, creating an illusion of scarcity to inflate the price. These projects often hold a much larger reserve that could be released later, potentially exerting downward pressure on prices for retail investors.



In response, Binance seeks to empower promising small and medium-sized projects with sound fundamentals. The exchange outlined its proactive approach in a recent report titled “Low Float & High FDV: How Did We Get Here?”



Binance is now inviting applications from high-quality teams and projects across various sectors with moderate valuations to participate in its listing programs. These programs encompass direct spot listing, Launchpools, and Mega Drops.



Specifically, Binance is seeking projects that:




Allocate a significant portion of tokens to community users.



Maintain a reasonable token float at Token Generation Events (TGEs).



Limit allocations to non-community users.



Demonstrate a strong product-market fit (PMF).



Possess a self-sustaining business model.



Have a minimum viable product (MVP) in place.



Ideally, showcase innovation in technology or design.




Additionally, Binance prioritizes projects with:




An organic user base.



Sustainable user growth.



A commitment to responsible regulatory and compliance practices.




Potential benefits of this initiative include more justifiable valuations and token allocations, a better alignment with retail investors and the broader community, and increased exposure for promising projects through Binance’s extensive platform.









Binance’s new listing initiative marks a significant step towards fostering a more mature and transparent cryptocurrency market. By prioritizing projects with strong fundamentals and user focus, the exchange aims to curb the prevalence of inflated valuations and safeguard retail investors.

Solana Surges While Rest of Crypto Majors Start Week Flat - The Defiant

Solana has been on a tear this past week, as tokens issued on the blockchain hit new highs.
Crypto markets traded flat on Monday morning, following a strong performance last week driven by positive Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) inflows and macroeconomic indicators. Solana popped as network metrics climb.Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $67,698, up 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Ether (ETH) is up 2% to $3,125, while Solana (SOL) rose by nearly 6%, according to CoinGecko data.BTC / ETH / SOL PriceInvestors are sitting on the sidelines after a strong week, dominated by macroeconomic developments, according to Ryze Labs. .April’s U.S. CPI print was cooler than expected, coming in at 0.3% month-on-month compared to the market expectation of 0.4%.The slower-than-expected inflation rate “has quelled rumors of a potential rate hike and paves the way for Powell to consider a rate cut in the coming months.”Michael Van de Poppe, CEO of MN Trading, believes Bitcoin is likely to continue moving within its current range, without significant volatility.“I'd rather expect consolidation and slow upwards movements towards the all-time high. The thesis remains the same: Altcoins to outperform in between,” he wrote on X.Data from CryptoQuant indicates that exchange BTC reserves have drastically declined to 1,929,696 BTC as of May 19. This marks a more than 50% decrease from July 2021, which could suggest a reduction in the liquid supply of Bitcoin, implying that investors are moving their holdings off exchanges for long term storage.The exception is Solana, which is up by the most among blockchains with market capitalizations of over $1 billion, after Sui. The Solana network has been on a tear driven by the meme coin craze, with over 20,000 tokens being created on Solana each day, according to data compiled by Step Finance.Bitcoin RallyAccording to Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, Bitcoin could rally only if it breaks the resistance levels of $67,500.“A breakthrough above $67,500 could potentially lead to new all-time highs, a scenario that our Bitcoin ETF model predicts,” he wrote in a note.Data from CoinGlass shows that in the past 24 hours, 48,218 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations amounting to $108.08 million. The largest single liquidation order occurred on OKX, involving an ETH-USD swap valued at $2.91 million.In other news, Michael Sonnenshein is stepping down as the CEO of Grayscale Investments LLC. He will be replaced by Peter Mintzberg, a former Goldman Sachs executive, effective August 15.Crypto Stocks SurgeCrypto stocks saw some gains on Monday. Coinbase is up 0.45%, while MicroStrategy is up 0.98%, reaching $1,600 a share.U.S. stocks showed little change, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.1%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively.Investors are awaiting the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April 30 to May 1 meeting, due May 22.

Bitcoin Shrimps Capitulate: The Bullish Sign That BTC Needs?


								On-chain data shows the smallest of the Bitcoin investors, the shrimps, have been selling recently. Here’s what it could mean for the coin.
Bitcoin Total Amount Of Holders Go Down As Retail Investors Exit
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the Total Amount Of Holders metric has registered a decline recently. This indicator keeps track of the total number of addresses on the blockchain that are currently carrying some non-zero balance.

When the value of this metric trends up, it can be a potential sign that adoption of the cryptocurrency is spreading right now. On the other hand, a drop in its value suggests some investors have decided to exit from the asset has they are completely clearing out their wallets.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Total Amount Of Holders over the last few months:

Looks like the value of the metric has been going down in recent weeks | Source: Santiment on X
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Total Amount Of Holders has been observing a drawdown recently, implying a net number of investors have been leaving the cryptocurrency.
The latest drawdown in this metric is the steepest it has been since the all-time high (ATH) back in March. It’s possible that the latest recovery above $67,000 is what has enticed these holders into selling.
In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for the total amount of Bitcoin supply held by the investors carrying less than 0.1 BTC in their wallets. Such small holders represent a part of the retail investors and are popularly known as the shrimps.
From the graph, it’s visible that the combined holdings of the BTC shrimps has gone down recently, with these small entities offloading 0.46% of their coins in just the past week.
Interestingly, this decline has come alongside the drawdown in the Total Amount of Holders, so it would appear possible that the ones liquidating their wallets have in fact been these small hands.

The retail investors may be thinking that the current price recovery isn’t going to last long, so they could be exiting while they still can at these relatively high prices. The larger entities in the market like the sharks and whales would potentially be picking up these coins, thus growing their holdings even larger.
“Historically, small wallets dumping their coins to larger wallets is an encouraging and bullish sign for BTC,” notes the analytics firm. It now remains to be seen whether this latest trend will indeed end up becoming the bullish spark the asset requires or not.
BTC Price
Bitcoin’s latest surge has meant that the cryptocurrency’s price has now surpassed the $67,000 level for the first time in almost a month. The last time a recovery above this level took place, BTC lost its bullish momentum before long. It’s uncertain whether a similar fate awaits BTC this time as well.

Potential US TikTok buyer plans to decentralize TikTok, could relay on Polkadot parachain

US billionaire Frank McCourt is leading a consortium to acquire TikTok and decentralize it using the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP) from Project Liberty.TikTok, boasting over 170 million users, is being pressured by the US government to sell due to national security concerns and purported links to the Chinese government.McCourt’s initiative, termed the “people’s bid,” represents one of several US corporate interests in the platform. He is collaborating with investment bank Guggenheim Securities and law firm Kirkland & Ellis on this venture.In a press statement, McCourt highlighted that the bid aims to empower users by migrating TikTok to an open-source protocol. This move intends to restore control over digital identities and data, offering Americans a significant voice and stake in the web’s future.TikTok meets PolkadotMcCourt’s plan to rebuild TikTok with DSNP will leverage Polkadot parachain social platform Frequency.In November 2022, Frequency secured its position as a parachain on the Polkadot network. According to its website, the parachain was built to “empower individuals to ensure the portability of their content and safeguard their privacy. The protocol enables ownership of digital identity and control over online presence.”McCourt noted that the decentralization move would return control and value to the users while empowering them to participate in the future of the Internet. He commented:“The foundation of our digital infrastructure is broken, and it’s time to fix it… We see this potential acquisition as an incredible opportunity to catalyze an alternative to the current tech model that has colonized the internet.”Additionally, McCourt’s vision for TikTok prioritizes data protection and empowers social media creators by granting them greater control over their data through DSNP. He said:“A new and better version of the internet where individuals are respected and they own and control their identity and their data.”Meanwhile, several Polkadot enthusiasts have welcomed the news, viewing it as proof of the blockchain network’s technological advancements.Latest Alpha Market Report

Gold Soars to New Highs Amid Economic Uncertainty, Rate Cut Expectations - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Gold prices have been on a remarkable trajectory, reaching new all-time highs recently. The precious metal’s surge can be attributed to a confluence of factors, including geopolitical tensions, concerns about fiat currency stability, and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s expectations of interest rate cuts. As investors seek safe-haven assets amid global economic uncertainty, gold has emerged as a preferred choice.



What Are the Factors Driving the 2024 Gold Rally?



Geopolitical concerns have played a significant role in driving gold prices higher. The recent helicopter crash involving the Iranian president initially spooked traders, highlighting the ongoing tensions in the Middle East. Moreover, the massive borrowing undertaken by governments worldwide has raised concerns about the stability of fiat currencies, further bolstering gold’s appeal as a safer asset than credit instruments. Global credit issues have also contributed to the shift towards gold, with investors viewing short-term dips in gold prices as buying opportunities amid the overall upward momentum.



Expectations of interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve have been another key driver of gold’s rally. Lower-than-expected inflation data in the U.S. has suggested a downward trend, fueling speculation about potential rate cuts. This, coupled with steady U.S. Treasury yields and a weakening U.S. Dollar, has created a favorable environment for gold prices to climb. Additionally, global economic factors, such as China’s measures to stabilize its property sector, have contributed to the positive sentiment surrounding gold.





Gold Price Forecast and Market Outlook



Many analysts and financial institutions predict that gold prices will continue their upward trend. In the near term, the $2,500 level is a potential target (preferred by Goldman Sachs), supported by the current bullish momentum and technical indicators. Market volatility and noisy trading sessions are expected to persist, but short-term dips should present buying opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the bullish trend.



Several global institutions have issued optimistic forecasts for gold prices. Citibank expects gold to reach $3,000 per ounce within the next 6-18 months, while Goldman Sachs forecasts gold prices reaching $2,700 per ounce by year-end, driven by a strong bull market. J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley project gold prices to reach $2,500 per ounce by the end of 2024, with the potential to reach $2,700 per ounce in the long term. Due to economic uncertainty and inflation concerns, particularly in major markets like China and India, the demand for gold is expected to remain robust.

OpenAI Pulls 'Horny' ChatGPT Voice, Denies It's a Scarlett Johansson Knockoff - Decrypt

Well, so much for the “Her” jokes. OpenAI, the company behind the latest multimodal language model, GPT-4o, has announced that it is pausing the development of its new voice, called “Sky.” The decision comes amidst a wave of suggestive comments, memes, and comparisons to Scarlett Johansson's AI character in the film “Her,” which prompted the company to debunk any ties to the Hollywood actress."We've heard questions about how we chose the voices in ChatGPT, especially Sky. We are working to pause the use of Sky while we address them," OpenAI stated.OpenAI's Sky voice was unveiled last week as part of the company's efforts to create more human-like and natural conversations with its AI models. The voice was designed to understand and respond to emotional cues, showcasing the advanced capabilities of GPT-4o.However, the demonstration quickly took a different direction, as users began to test the model's boundaries and flirt with the voice. A flurry of tweets described Sky as “flirty,” “sexy,” and “provocative,” with some users joking about having a new girlfriend or feeling seduced by the AI voice.Parallels were drawn to the 2013 Spike Jonze film "Her," featuring Scarlett Johansson as an AI assistant that a lonely writer becomes attached to. The situation escalated with comedy sketches referencing Sky's sultry vocals and apparent resemblance to the actress —a similarity even noted by OpenAI co-founder Andrej KarpathyAnd here’s where things started to get tricky. Johansson has actively opposed training AI models on her likeness, while OpenAI is known for aiming to release models as content-friendly as possible to avoid controversy—to the point of being criticized for “dumbing down” its models, or allegedly fine-tuning them to have a more left-leaning stance. Within days, CEO Sam Altman tweeted about potential changes to Sky, assuring people that the new model was not publicly available.On Sunday, the company apparently put the first nail in Sky’s coffin announcing that it was pausing development. The announcement was accompanied by an official blog post explaining how OpenAI worked with voice actors to select and train its voice models.In the article, the company denied using Johansson's voice as a template for Sky, clarifying that it belonged to an unnamed professional actress who was using her own voice."We worked with industry-leading casting and directing professionals to narrow down over 400 submissions before selecting the five voices ... Each of the voices—Breeze, Cove, Ember, Juniper and Sky—are sampled from voice actors we partnered with to create them.” OpenAI said.“We believe that AI voices should not deliberately mimic a celebrity's distinctive voice—Sky's voice is not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson but belongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice,” the post notes.OpenAI said it would not reveal the actors’ identities due to privacy reasons. The company also revealed that it plans to introduce additional voices in the future to better match the diverse interests and preferences of users.Probably none of those will flirt with you, though, based on the fallout to Sky.Edited by Andrew HaywardGenerally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

House expected to vote on bipartisan crypto market structure bill Wednesday - Blockworks


The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on a landmark cryptocurrency market structure bill this week. 
The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, known as the FIT21 Act, is expected to head to the floor for a vote in the House on May 22, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
FIT21 advanced through the House Agriculture and Financial Services Committees last summer before getting the greenlight from the Rules Committee to advance to a vote earlier this month. The bipartisan legislation has 11 co-sponsors, including Democrats Henry Cuellar of Texas, Wiley Nickel of North Carolina and Ritchie Torres of New York. 
The proposed market structure law establishes joint rulemaking powers between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Notably, the bill grants the latter control over digital commodities markets, including exchanges and broker-dealers. 
The legislation also clarifies how digital assets are classified, stating that the existence of an investment contract alone does not make a token a security, a distinction that could impact several pending legal disputes between token issuers and crypto exchanges and the SEC. 
About 70% of all crypto tokens should be classified as commodities rather than securities, the co-sponsors wrote in a fact sheet published alongside the bill. 
While FIT21 managed to survive markup, there has been pushback from some House Democrats, who argue the legislation goes too far to limit SEC power. 
Rep. Jonathan Jackson, D-Ill., last summer proposed an amendment — which never passed — to strike a section of the bill that allows firms who have filed a “notice of intent to register” to be exempt from certain enforcement actions from the SEC. 
“Allowing for ‘intent to register’ before those regulations are completed would be an absolute injustice to our constituents and retail investors,” Jackson said. “This industry needs to be under full-force regulation and oversight.” 
Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn Thompson, R-Penn., countered that the “notice of intent” allows firms who meet requirements for treatment of customer funds, disclosures and records to operate limitedly while the potentially years-long registration approval process plays out. The bill also allows the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission to issue enforcement actions against firms who have completed the “notice of intent” process. 
The Republican majority in the House however, coupled with the expected support of at least some Democrats, mean the bill is likely to pass and make it to the Senate, where its fate is less clear. 
The expected House vote comes days after the US Senate passed another crypto-focused piece of legislation Thursday: Joint Resolution 109, which seeks to invalidate the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. 
The resolution now heads to the President’s desk. The Biden Administration said earlier this month the President will veto the legislation.

Vitalik Buterin Shares Rare Ethereum (ETH) Roadmap Update


Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum, recently provided an update on the ETH roadmap, detailing significant progress and upcoming developments for the blockchain network. This follows the recent Dencun upgrade, implemented on March 13, which aims to reduce costs for layer-2 transactions and improve data availability.The Dencun upgrade introduced proto-danksharding, also known as EIP-4844, which allows for the inclusion of data "blobs" in blocks. This upgrade marks a substantial improvement in network efficiency, building on the previous successes of the Merge and Shanghai upgrades.The next in line are The Verge and The Purge upgrades. The first will see the integration of Verkle trees, which will enable stateless clients and reduce the cost of running a node. This change is anticipated to allow for a tenfold increase in the layer-1 gas limit, resulting in cheaper transactions. The latter aims to simplify the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by removing certain features, such as the SELFDESTRUCT opcode and the 2,300 gas stipend. This simplification will streamline the EVM and enhance its efficiency.Ethereum Roadmap by Vitalik ButerinIn the latest post, Buterin noted that the ban on the SELFDESTRUCT opcode is nearly complete. While the opcode remains for now, its most problematic behavior — editing an unlimited number of storage slots simultaneously — has been addressed with the Dencun upgrade. This adjustment is an important step toward simplifying Ethereum’s protocol and improving its security and performance. These updates highlight Ethereum's ongoing efforts to evolve into a more scalable and efficient blockchain.

Injective, Fantom soar as Bitcoin price surges past $68k - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Injective price rose 10% to above $27.26, while Fantom hit $0.96 after surging 12%.
Gains for the altcoins came as Bitcoin price crossed the $68,000 mark to hit its highest level since April 12.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rose more than 2% in afternoon trading on Monday as bulls broke above $68,000. 
This is the first time that the flagship crypto asset has reached these levels since April 12 – when BTC fell from highs of $69,100.
Injective, Fantom prices surge
As the benchmark cryptocurrency looked towards the $69k mark, a host of altcoins mirrored the upside. Ethereum broke above $3,150, BNB hit $580 and Solana price rose to above $181, notching a 24-hour uptick of nearly 6%.
However, some of the biggest gainers on the day were Injective (INJ) and Fantom (FTM).
According to data from CoinGecko, Injective price was up 10% to $27.26 at the time of writing. Meanwhile, Fantom continued its recent upward momentum with a 12% spike that saw FTM price hit highs of $0.96.
Injective’s 24-hour trading volume rose more than 113% to $121 million, while Fantom’s was up 11% to over $385 million.
Bitcoin price hits highest level in over a month
BTC’s jump to $68,679 on Coinbase saw the leading cryptocurrency reach its highest price level in more than a month.

The sudden spike in the price of Bitcoin comes after the benchmark cryptocurrency bounced sharply following last week’s release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.
On May 15, BTC price rose more than 8% from lows of $61,539 to highs of $66,480 as stocks rallied amid the softer-than-expected CPI data for April. 
Today’s gains come as the spot Bitcoin ETFs resume sharp inflows after the past few weeks recorded unimpressive numbers.
Analysts at QCP noted last week that the slowing inflation, institutional adoption of Bitcoin and the upcoming US election could provide catalysts for new momentum that takes BTC to above $74k.
As Bitcoin extends gains above the $66k support level, it’s likely a breakout above the $70k area will open a path for bulls to target a new all-time high. 
Before then, crypto analyst Rekt Capital expects a run to the $71,500 area.

                        In an unexpected twist, retail investors are flocking back to Ethereum meme coin markets, and new token Apu has exploded on DEX markets.This article will provide an analysis of APU’s current price trends and look to see whether an innovative new meme coin, Dogeverse, represents a more promising investment opportunity at this time.Retail capital returning to Ethereum is a notable shift in market dynamics after months of sustained Solana meme coin dominance, which can be explained largely by a significant decline in the price of ETH gas fees since the Dencun upgrade.This has fuelled improvements in Ethereum activity, with rising interested in ERC-20 meme coins contributing to the recent uptick in volume across the leading proof-of-stake network – ending months of declining volume.Leading the pack today is APU token, which plays on a cross-over between the much beloved Apu Nahasapeemapetilon (the owner of the Kwik-E-Mart on The Simpsons) and the cousin of Pepe the frog – Apu Apustaja.APU Price Analysis: As New Ethereum Meme Coin Basks in Glory, Is This Other Token Next to Pump?
As APU price continues to fight for a second-rally leg, Apu token is currently trading at a market price of $0.00000001682 (representing a 24-hour change of -82%).This comes as part of a significant retracement move, which has seen APU price take a tumble since a sell-off by early backers was triggered at the all-time high of $0.00000028.However, in an optimistic sign, holders have posted bullish divergence above the descendant down trend, and now, with two hours of consolidation teasing the idea of $0.000000015 forming a new support level, things could be set to reverse.Indeed, APU price action now returns to a previously established accumulation zone between $0.000000015 and $0.000000040, providing further weight to the bullish case for APU.Meanwhile, the retracement has also seen APU’s market cap decrease to a more appetizing level at just $13k – this could provide one of the easiest 50x moves on the market today.Yet, with price action near capitulative territory, this is also a high-risk position, especially with 119 holders still yet to make an exit.The order book reflects this predicament, with transactions balanced at 50% buys to 50% sells in the past 6-hours.But while APU offers a super high-risk play, market analysts are honing in on a soon-to-launch multi-chain meme coin as the next viral play.Explore Dogeverse Ahead of Major Tier 1 CEX Listings in Q2 2024
Touted as the “chain traveling Doge,” Dogeverse has multi-chain functionality across major networks like Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana making it a versatile contender in the meme coin arena.With 15% of its 200 billion supply up for grabs, early investors stand to gain significantly after the $15M raise.The project’s structure and potential for high returns, including a staggering +582% APY return for stakers, underline its ambitious roadmap.High APY staking has been all the rage recently, and Dogeverse is set to steal all the limelight.Beyond its playful facade, Dogeverse introduces real utility, offering seamless integration across different blockchain environments – this feature not only enhances accessibility but also adds a layer of convenience for investors.Click here to take part in the Dogeverse presale

Trader Says One Crypto Narrative Even Bigger Than AI, Predicts ‘Biggest Altcoin Season Ever’ - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto trader believes there is a stronger bullish market narrative for digital assets than artificial intelligence (AI) that could send altcoins to new all-time highs (ATHs).
Pseudonymous trader Criptopaul tells his 105,900 followers on the social media platform X that real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has the potential to send altcoins soaring in the current cycle more than the hype around AI.










“In my opinion RWA is still the biggest narrative of this cycle, more than AI, since the RWA concept itself is based on blockchain and is a real financial revolution that has been hypothesized for years and since Ethereum was born. Tokenization.”
The analyst is also predicting a massive breakout for Ethereum (ETH) against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) which he believes will also signal the beginning of a historic breakout in the broader altcoin market.
“The stars are about to align on ETH/BTC and the biggest altcoin season ever will begin… 
ETH/BTC double bottom. You ready?”



Source: Criptopaul/X



Looking at his weekly chart, the analyst believes that ETH/BTC has printed a bullish double bottom pattern at around the 0.046 BTC ($3,118) level. A double bottom pattern in technical analysis often suggests that an upward trend is coming after a period of decline.
ETH/BTC is trading for 0.0466 BTC ($3,148) at time of writing, up more than 1.4% in the last 24 hours.

Crypto Analyst Sounds Warning Alarm For Potential 50-60% Crash In Chainlink Price, Here’s Why


																Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto recently warned that Chainlink (LINK) could experience a 50% to 60% drop in its price. However, based on his explanation, LINK holders may not have cause to worry as such a price drop is part of the crypto token’s growth.
Why Chainlink Will Experience A Price Drop
CrediBULL Crypto explained in an X (formerly Twitter) post that a “50-60% drawdown is normal, natural, and healthy” given that Chainlink has experienced ten months of up only and a 4x rally.” The analyst expects this price drawdown to last about two to three months and suggested that Chainlink could see brief price surges, but that doesn’t invalidate the current bearish trend.

Source: X
In a video posted on his YouTube channel, CrediBULL Crypto further explained why he is so confident in shorting Chainlink. He alluded to the rise in the crypto token’s open interest and claimed that many levered players entered Chainlink on the pump to a major resistance level. He expects that those investors who opened longs will likely begin to close their positions as soon as Bitcoin experiences a pullback and the crypto market starts bleeding again. 
The crypto analyst added that these investors will capitulate at the lows, which will bring Chainlink’s price to the range lows. CrediBULL Crypto claimed that this move will bring LINK back down to $11.96, about a 30% drop from its current price levels. Based on this, he revealed that he will be looking to short Chainlink around $16, which is the likely level for rejection. 
Same Expectations For Meme Coins
CrediBULL Crypto also expects meme coins to experience a significant price drawdown, given the parabolic rally they have enjoyed since the beginning of the year. Meme coins Dogwifhat (WIF) and Pepe (PEPE) have been the most significant year-to-date (YTD) gainers among the top 50 crypto tokens, with price gains of over 1,400% and 500%, respectively. 
The crypto analyst warned that some major meme coins have already seen their tops and will likely experience significant declines. In the YouTube video he posted, he also gave insights into how low Dogecoin, WIF, and Pepe could drop.

For Dogecoin, he predicts that the foremost meme coin could drop to as low as $0.10. However, CrediBULL Crypto noted that he can’t short Dogecoin yet because he expects a relief pump to $0.18, the range he is looking to open a short position. 
Meanwhile, he predicts that WIF could drop to as low as $1.6, revealing that he will be looking to short it at $3.90 because he expects the meme coin to enjoy one last push to the upside before dropping to the downside. CrediBULL also predicts a significant price decline for PEPE. He claims the meme coin could experience a drawdown of as much as 60% since it recently hit a new all-time high (ATH).

Cardano Founder Reveals What Will Decide The Winner In The US Presidential Elections | Bitcoinist.com


								Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson has shed light on the regulatory and political challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry. Expressing frustration and discontent with the current United States administration, Hoskinson has urged crypto enthusiasts to take a stance against anti-crypto parties who are contesting in the upcoming US presidential elections. 
Cardano Founder Says “Vote Crypto”
In a recent YouTube video, Hoskinson raised concerns regarding the current US administration’s anti-crypto stance. He emphasized a recent policy statement made by US President Joe Biden, who vowed to veto the House of Representatives’ efforts to oppose the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) controversial accounting policy on crypto assets. 

In response to Biden’s anti-crypto policy, Hoskinson criticized it as “garbage,” alleging that the government was intentionally limiting the growth of the crypto industry in America. The Cardano founder noted that countries like China and regions like Europe had been actively nurturing their crypto industry, establishing clear regulations and adopting less hostile policies and regulations toward digital asset advancements  
Expressing disappointment and frustration, Hoskinson voiced concern over the recent actions of the US SEC and the Biden Administration against the digital asset market, asserting that the administration intends to destroy and severely harm the American cryptocurrency industry. The Cardano founder warned against voting for Biden in the upcoming US Presidential elections, encouraging crypto supporters to take a stand against an administration that continuously undermines the evolution and expansion of the crypto industry. 
Additionally, Hoskinson stated that the US administration was systematically obliterating the American’s race and economic potential. He underscored the potential consequences of the administration’s ongoing enforcement actions, warning that the US risked losing its competitive standing globally and facing a grim future characterized by restricted financial options, mounting debts and a weakened economy. 
Concluding his remarks, Hoskinson passionately stated to “vote crypto,” declaring that “a vote for Biden was a vote against the American crypto industry.”
Will 50 Million Crypto Supporters Decide The Next US President?
According to Hoskinson, there are over 50 million cryptocurrency users in the United States and the election of a US President with an anti crypto agenda could negatively impact the development of the crypto industry. 
More importantly, it could destroy the decentralized foundation cryptocurrencies have been built on, potentially limiting the financial autonomy and security of millions of crypto users in the US, and enforcing actions against good actors within the crypto space. 

As of 2022, the adult population of the US stood at 258 million individuals aged 18 years or older. Should 50 million American crypto users vote against Biden in the forthcoming elections, it would signify that 19.38% of the US adult populace opposes him. 
The percentage could wield considerable influence in determining the next President of the US. With the presidential elections scheduled for November 5, contenders like Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy, who are crypto advocates, are vying for victory.

Company that fried Red Lobster put shrimp on the blockchain


The seafood company that drove restaurant chain Red Lobster to bankruptcy with a misguided ‘Endless Shrimp’ promotion was previously praised for using blockchain technology to promote sustainable seafood production.
Bangkok-based Thai Union became Red Lobster’s biggest investor in 2020 and subsequently took the decision to make the company’s popular ‘$20 Ultimate Endless Shrimp’ offer a permanent part of its menu. The promotion, which had been running on a limited-time basis for 20 years, was seen as the ideal way to shift the huge amounts of shrimp that Thai Union was catching.
However, a 40% increase in customer traffic saw the chain, which was already struggling due to increased labor costs, falling sales, and the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, giving away mountains of free shrimp it could ill afford.
As reported by CNN, under the stewardship of a CEO appointed by Thai Union, Red Lobster cut ties with two of its breaded shrimp suppliers, leaving the Bangkok-based seafood giant with an exclusive deal.
This reportedly led to higher costs and went against Red Lobster’s previous approach of choosing its suppliers based on projected demand.
The free shrimp fiasco has reportedly cost Red Lobster somewhere in the region of $11 million.

Thai Union used blockchain to track shrimp
Back in 2020, Thai Union announced that it would be putting shrimp on the blockchain. The company, alongside data analytics company Sea Warden and supply chain traceability firm Wholechain, began piloting the use of satellite imaging for shrimp farming operations.
The idea was that satellite images collected by Sea Warden would generate data that Wholechain could store on the blockchain and allow shrimp farmed by Thai Union to essentially be tracked ‘from farm to fork.’
This, in turn, would provide valuable insights into the sustainability, health, and environmental impacts of Thai Union’s activities and ultimately inform its purchasing and business decisions.

XRP Price Prediction with Ripple Quantum Computing Research


                        
                            XRP Price Prediction as Ripple Backs Quantum Computing Research – Can XRP Hold Above $0.50?

                              May 20, 2024 13:52 EDT

                        The XRP price has raised 0.29% in the past 24 hours, increasing to $0.51073. This comes as the crypto market as a whole has experienced a decline.XRP is now up 2.29% in the past week, indicating a continuation of XRP’s monthly 1.60% price increase.In the past year, the altcoin has seen a modest return of 8.93%, as per TradingView data.This pales in comparison to the returns of major tokens like BTC, ETH, and SOL in the past 12 months. However, it also suggests that XRP could see above-average gains later in the year.This recent price action follows Ripple’s backing of quantum-resistant cryptographic systems, which may boost future XRP price action.Can XRP Hold Above 0.50?
XRP’s chart is looking promising today, with the coin looking ready to post some more gains after dipping a little overnight.The altcoin is approaching a retest of the $0.5005 support level (yellow), which has continued to hold XRP price above $0.50.Breaking through this level decisively could lead to a continued decline in price.Other indicators argue against this, with XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) rebounding towards 50, up from a low of 25 earlier this morning. This suggests that the recent price decline was temporary and does not signal a complete shift in momentum.Additionally, the altcoin’s 30-day moving average (orange) is trending downward and nearing a crossover with the 200-day average (blue), having dipped below it earlier in the day. This suggests that XRP is currently oversold.The coin’s 24-hour trading volume has also risen in recent days, with its move up 76% to $827,803,541. This confirms increased interest in XRP among investors.Several factors contribute to optimism about XRP’s price, including the broader market’s upward trend following a slowdown in March.While technical indicators suggest positive short-term price movements, sustainable long-term growth will likely hinge on fundamental factors.How Does Quantum Computing Research Contribute?
Ripple’s renewed investment in the research and development of quantum-resistant cryptographic systems could drive future price action.Professor Massimiliano Sala, from Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI), highlighted quantum challenges in blockchain technologies in a Ripple Insight article.Professor Sala emphasizes the critical vulnerabilities that quantum computing introduces to blockchain security in its potential to “undermine the mechanisms that protect users’ assets on blockchain platforms.”Given that cryptography forms the fundamental backbone of blockchain technology, readiness is critical in the developing era of quantum computing. Sala added:“While quantum threats may not be immediate, their probability is significant, necessitating proactive measures.”Ripple is pioneering quantum-resistant cryptographic methods through research. Success could strengthen Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL), providing a strategic advantage in the broader industry with enhanced platform security.This advantage might increase XRPL adoption for future-proofing operations from the looming quantum threat, benefiting the blockchain’s native token XRP.Adoption is something that has significantly hindered XRP price movement since 2022. The long-running Ripple-SEC lawsuit has caused regulatory uncertainty that has slowed institutional adoption.However, the Ripple-SEC case is now in the final settlement phase. Ripple may face a settlement fine as high as $2 billion, yet the upshot of such a penalty is that it will draw a line in the sand and enable the firm to continue growing.Coupled with a strengthened platform, it could restore confidence in Ripple as a major player in the crypto industry.In the long run, this points to a rising XRP price, which could reach $1 by the close of 2024.While XRP is set to perform well in the long term, some traders are stacking this meme coin that is packed with potential.High-Potential Meme Tokens Could Bring Bigger Gains
Indeed, the issue with XRP is that because it’s a coin that rests more on fundamentals than hype, it may take a while to enjoy some properly big returns.However, traders looking for quicker and bigger gains may do well to investigate some of the newer meme tokens that are currently doing the rounds.Sealana’s presale is in its final phase and will be ending soon, with investors having rushed to buy its token with over $2 million raised so far.This quick inflow suggests that whales are already diving into the project.Although SEAL is built on Solana, anyone with SOL, ETH or BNB in their wallets can purchase it now at a presale price of $0.022 per token.Sealana is at the forefront of a new wave of meme coins that are helping the Solana network challenge Ethereum’s dominance as the go-to blockchain for viral meme coins.Sealana comes off the back of wildly successful predecessors DogWifHat ($WIF), Bonk ($BONK), Book of Meme ($BOME) and Popcat ($POPCAT), all of which quickly rose to become  top ten meme coins by market capitalization.Follow the latest developments on Sealana’s X account.Buy Sealana Here

Bitcoin Holds Ground Above $68,000 Despite Small Traders' Sell-Off ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Bitcoin continued its ascent on Monday, building upon its impressive momentum from the preceding week when it reached a peak of $68,203. Despite undergoing a period of consolidation within a channel since mid-March, the main trend remains particularly bullish.



On Monday, popular cryptocurrency analytics platform Santiment underscored Bitcoin’s resilience. They observed that this activity could be considered a positive sign while smaller traders have been shedding their holdings amidst the recent price surge.



“Bitcoin is maintaining levels just above $66,100 as smaller traders persist in liquidating their holdings despite the crypto rebound over the past week. Historically, the transfer of coins from smaller to larger wallets signifies an encouraging and bullish trend for $BTC,” Santiment tweeted.







Adding to this optimistic sentiment is Axel Adler, a crypto analyst at Cryptoquant, who observed that entities possessing over 1,000 Bitcoins have been accumulating and refraining from selling, anticipating an upswing in value.







“The current 30-day average is 641 BTC. Whales are unwilling to sell their coins as they anticipate a rise in value,” the analyst added.

&nbsp



Andler further noted that investors holding Bitcoin for 1-3 months have exited unrealized losses. He also noted that the MVRV for this timeframe has turned positive at $66,500. Looking ahead, he emphasized that $70,000 remains a crucial resistance level to watch.



Elsewhere, analyst Sonny Mulder also expressed optimism about the continuation of the uptrend. “Seems like it’s gearing up for another upward move soon,” Mulder tweeted. “The retracement to $50k appears less likely now, given that the last low was invalidated by a higher high… We must adjust our course and recognize the low at $56K as the more probable bottom unless we dip below our Wyckoff accumulation structure at approximately $61K.”



Another analyst, “DrProfitCrypto,” also pointed out that he anticipates that a breach above $70,000 will incite the initial wave of FOMO (fear of missing out) among investors, followed by another surge at $74,000. With ongoing institutional inflows and robust technical indicators, DrProfitCrypto set Bitcoin’s next target within the $82,000-$88,000 range.



Bitcoin traded at $68,288 at press time, reflecting a 2.25% increase over the past 24 hours. Notably, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted the significance of over 530,000 $BTC transacted at $66,250, marking a crucial support level. According to him, Bitcoin has strong potential for further gains if it holds.

                        As cryptocurrency markets push higher on Monday, with Bitcoin (BTC) surpassing $68,000 as traders look ahead of this week’s Fed meeting minutes release, Nvidia earnings and the SEC’s decision on spot Ethereum ETFs, investors are hunting for the best crypto to buy now that might hand them quick gains.While upcoming risk events could scupper sentiment, crypto markets maintain strong momentum amid macro tailwinds and following technical breakouts.Bitcoin just pushed convincingly above late-April highs. Back above all of its major moving averages, the next upside target for Bitcoin is its April highs at $72,800.Bitcoin could soon return to $72,800, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewkHaving found support at its 2024 uptrend, Ether (ETH), meanwhile, is looking to break above key resistance around $3,150-3,200.That could open the door to a quick run higher towards $3,700.Source: TradingViewSolana (SOL), meanwhile, has been enjoying strong momentum ever since breaking out of its mid-April to mid-May $120-$160 range. A return above $200 in the near future is very likely.While blue-chip cryptocurrencies look set to do very well in the short term, some impatient traders are hunting even faster gains.Smaller and lesser-known altcoins with lower market caps stand a better chance of deliver quick 2x or more gains.Let’s have a look at some candidates for best crypto to buy now.Best Crypto to Buy NowFantom (FTM)Layer-1 blockchain competitor to Ethereum and Solana Fantom (FTM) is pumping hard on Monday, up 13.5% in 24 hours.That’s according to CoinMarketCap, which puts its market cap at $2.68 billion.Since breaking resistance around $0.80, FTM looks set up for a quick retest of its 2024 highs around $1.23.If this is the start of a new push higher, FTM could quickly 3.5x to return to its 2021 record highs above $3.50. That’s why it might be the best crypto to buy now.Injective (INJ)Another flashy layer-1 blockchain altcoins Injective (INJ) is also pumping hard, up 11% in 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap.If Injective can break to the north of its 50DMA, a quick retest of resistance at $30 becomes likely.A break above here would open the door to a quick return to March highs above $52.Injective could quickly 2x if it can break above short-term resistance levels, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewGiven it could quickly enjoy 2x gains, INJ could be the best crypto to buy today.Sui (SUI)On a day when layer-1 altcoins are leading the market higher, Sui (SUI) is another token performing well.As per CoinMarketCap, it was last up 10% in 24 hours at $1.13, its market cap around $2.6 billion.Like Injective, SUI might be able to quickly 2x to return to yearly highs.But that depends on its breaking above key resistance, such as around $1.40.Crypto Alternatives to Consider
Altcoins are a great way to make quick gains in crypto. But most of the above-mentioned coins are already too well-established to provide traders with gains of upwards of 10x.For those bigger gains, traders will need to get in super early on newer coins.For risk-tolerant investors looking to add upside exposure to their portfolios, presale investing is potentially a good strategy.Web3 startups often sell their token at an early discount in presales to fund development and build hype.With so many presales on the market, it can be tough to know where to start.

LayerZero Labs Identifies 800,000 Potential Sybil Addresses in Public List - The Defiant

The list is preliminary and not definitive until the final report is published.LayerZero Labs, a cross-chain interoperability protocol, on Sunday said that it has made public a list of 800,000 addresses flagged as created solely for the purpose of farming the project’s airdrop.On May 18, LayerZero concluded its Sybil self-reporting phase. During this period, users had the opportunity to report their wallet addresses as Sybils and receive 15% of their planned token allocation if they did so within a 14-day window.The 800,000 addresses account for 13% of the total six million addresses eligible for the airdrop.In an X post, LayerZero explained that the “remaining 85%” would be returned to “qualified users."LayerZero’s anti-Sybil campaign is one of the most aggressive efforts to identify and remove airdrop farmers at a time when the practice of using protocols to get token rewards in return has become a common practice in DeFi. The move has sparked some controversy, with some users arguing the line between legitimate trading and airdrop farming isn’t so clear-cut.In the context of blockchain networks, Sybil attacks involve creating multiple fake accounts to fraudulently accumulate tokens or rewards intended for legitimate users. This tactic manipulates token distributions by appearing as several unique participants. The goal is to exploit decentralized systems that reward user activity, often through mechanisms like airdrops.Initial analysisInitially, the team at LayerZero had identified over 2 million addresses as potential Sybils. They then refined their criteria to minimize false positives, ensuring that legitimate users were not wrongly labeled.The primary goal of this analysis was to identify and exclude "industrial Sybil clusters" from bounty hunting eligibility. These clusters are large groups of fake accounts created to manipulate token distributions.According to LayerZero, "This list is preliminary. It aims to remove large clusters of addresses from bounty hunting eligibility, but should not be seen as definitive until the final report is published. For example, an address could be removed from the sybil list as we update methodology."Bounty Hunting and RewardsParticipants interested in bounty hunting must report at least 20 addresses, outlining a clear methodology to prove they are sybils. Those who successfully report will receive 10% of the Sybil’s intended token allocation.An important note from LayerZero’s X post clarified that: "All bounties go to the first eligible reporter of a given address."The bounty hunting process started on May 18 and will continue until May 31. The final sybil list will be published afterward.Meanwhile, LayerZero Labs announced on May 2 that it completed the first snapshot for an upcoming airdrop. Eligibility criteria and details remain undisclosed.LayerZero adoptionData from Messari shows that in the first quarter of 2024, LayerZero protocol hosted over $6.7 billion worth of cross-chain asset transfers, marking a 91% increase from the previous quarter.Message traffic surged, with 29.6 million messages sent via LayerZero, reflecting a 60% quarterly increase. This period also saw a 93% rise in smart contract deployments on LayerZero, indicating growing developer adoption of the protocol.In April 2023, LayerZero raised $120 million in a Series B funding round, valuing the company at $3 billion.

May 23rd, the Big Day, is Near: Analysts Share Their Expectations on the Crypto Market and Prices - Bitcoin Sistemi


Analysts are predicting an increase in Ethereum price volatility ahead of this week's spot ETF application deadlines.
Cobo COO Lily King warned of increased volatility and cautious market behavior as traders navigate uncertainties. “We can expect volatility to increase and the market to remain cautious ahead of the decision on spot ETH ETF applications this week,” King said.


Presto research analyst Peter Chung echoed King's views in a report Monday. “Whether approval or rejection, we expect ETH volatility to increase as the May 23 deadline approaches,” Chung said.
The first round of spot ETH ETF deadlines is approaching, with VanEck's May 23 and Ark Invest/21Shares' May 24 deadlines.





However, the majority of analysts predict that the SEC will reject spot Ethereum ETF applications. Polymarket priced the chances of approval at just 14%. Market indicators show traders are largely expecting “rejection and non-event,” according to a report from QCP Capital released today.

However, the QCP Capital report added that a surprise approval of spot ETH ETFs this week could catch the market off guard. “This will trigger a short squeeze that easily takes us back to recent highs for ETH,” QCP Capital analysts said.


Analysts also argued that given ETH's dual role as both a store of value and a Layer 1 blockchain network, its approval would likely cause Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin in terms of price movement.

New York AG has reached a settlement with crypto lender Genesis for $2 billion to repay investors

A $2 billion settlement has been reached between New York Attorney General Letitia James and failed crypto lender Genesis to repay their investors. The settlement is said to be the largest against a cryptocurrency company in New York’s history. It mandates restitution for affected investors and bans Genesis trading from operating in the state.Nvidia stock has all-time closing high in its crosshairs“This historic settlement is a major step toward ensuring the victims who invested in Genesis have a semblance of justice,” said Attorney General James.“Once again, we see the real-world consequences and detrimental losses that can happen because of a lack of oversight and regulation within the cryptocurrency industry,” she added.“New York investors deserve the peace of mind that comes from a properly regulated marketplace, and that is something my office will always act to achieve.”As per the latest settlement, a “Victims’ Fund” for Genesis’ creditors will be created, and the victims will receive distributions from the assets remaining in Genesis’ estate. In the event that Genesis’ remaining assets are not sufficient to repay those creditors, the Victims’ Fund will receive up to $2 billion.This case relates to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX fraud in November 2022 and its consequences. Genesis, owned by Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, was a lending partner of the crypto exchange Gemini’s Earn product. It had its derivatives unit lock up around $175 million in funds with FTX. After hearing the news of FTX’s collapse, Genesis paused withdrawals from the Earn program, which had approximately $900 million in assets from 340,000 users.Crypto exchange and Genesis creditor Gemini didn’t like the way Genesis dealt with the financial troubles. Cameron Winklevoss wrote an open letter in January 2023 addressed to the CEO of Digital Currency Group, the parent organization of Genesis. In the letter, he accused the parent firm of acting in “bad faith” by delaying the process of returning the $900 million owed to clients of Gemini’s Earn program.New York Attorney General Letitia James charged Gemini Trust, Genesis Capital, and Digital Currency Group with $1 billion in fraud in 2023. Genesis, which is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings,  agreed to give $1.1 billion back to crypto customers. Meanwhile, Genesis Global Capital, which is also bankrupt, agreed to pay $21 million to settle charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for violating securities laws that are related to its involvement with the now-defunct Gemini Earn program.Recently, the failed crypto exchange FTX said in a statement that it expects almost 100% of its former customers to get back the money they lost when the cryptocurrency exchange collapsed. Earlier this year, FTX co-founder Sam-Bankman Fried was sentenced to jail for 25 years.

Solana On Fire, Analyst Expects SOL To Gain Another 90% Versus ETH


								Solana is tracking higher at spot rates as bulls appear keen to reclaim the 2024 highs printed in March. Amid this, one analyst is confident that SOL will extend gains versus Ethereum, looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart.
Solana To Outperform Ethereum? 
Sharing a SOLETH chart on X, the analyst notes that though prices have been consolidating, SOL bulls have the upper hand. So far, a clear “Cup and Handle” pattern is forming. 

While it does not guarantee higher prices, the pattern historically prints out, preceding a bull run and breakout above the local resistance. 
SOLETH prices trending upward | Source: @Negentropic_ on X
 
If the SOL bulls take over, the analyst predicts the SOLETH ratio will extend by at least 90%. After checking the events on the daily chart, it is clear that buyers have the upper hand. Despite the recent drawdown across the crypto scene, SOL has outperformed ETH in the last few months. 
The local resistance and all-time high in the SOLETH chart is at 0.05806 ETH. A breakout above this line will propel SOL to new territory, extending gains as Solana comes on top of Ethereum. 
Looking at the SOLUSDT chart, the coin is changing hands at around $177. After the recent breakout above $160, bulls appear to be in control, targeting. The $200 line remains a key target for upbeat bulls aiming for prices to clear all-time highs of $260 registered in 2021.

Multiple fundamental factors could ignite SOL demand. However, what’s been clear in the past few months is that Solana is increasingly a preferred choice for meme coins. Some of the most successful ones, including DogWifHat (WIF), BOME, and BONK, are all on Solana.
From Firedancer Hopes To Rising Adoption, SOL Trends Higher
Features such as high scalability, low transaction fees, and a developing ecosystem could explain the uptick. At the same time, the community is looking forward to the activation of the Firedancer validator client. 

The client, built from scratch by Jump Crypto, will make the network more reliable, reducing instances of network halts. In the past, Solana has been widely criticized for stopping on multiple occasions, inconveniencing network users.
Top utility apps | Source: Apple Store
The rapid expansion of the Solana-centric non-custodial Phantom wallet reflects surging interest in Solana. The wallet has climbed to the fourth position in the utility category on the Apple App Store. By the end of April, the Phantom Wallet had over seven million monthly active users.

Bitcoin "Profit-Taking Has Completed," Top Analyst Reveals


																An analyst has explained how profit-taking looks to have finished for Bitcoin in what has been a “very healthy reset” for the market.
Bitcoin SOPR Suggests Profit-Taking From Investors Has Cooled Off
In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed about the latest trend occurring in the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). The SOPR is an on-chain indicator that basically tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling their coins at a profit or loss right now.
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the average holder in the sector could be assumed to be moving coins at some net profit currently. On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies loss realization is the dominant mode of selling in the market.

	Related Reading



Naturally, the SOPR being exactly equal to 1 suggests the total profits being realized are exactly equal to the losses at the moment and thus, the investors are just breaking-even on their selling.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR over the last few years:

The value of the metric seems to have been neutral in recent days | Source: @woonomic on X
As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOPR had spiked to highly positive levels earlier when the cryptocurrency’s price had observed its rally towards a new all-time high (ATH).
This would suggest that the investors had been participating in some aggressive profit-taking during this run. From the chart, it’s visible that such a trend was also observed around the start of the 2021 bull run.
With the consolidation, the asset has gone through since the ATH, the indicator’s value has also seen a cooldown. As Woo has highlighted in the chart, the metric has now approached the neutral mark.
It would appear that two months after the profit-taking peaked, the appetite for harvesting gains has potentially finally disappeared among the investors. The analyst says this is a very healthy reset for the cryptocurrency, especially as the capital inflows have once again been picking up for the coin.

Looks like the indicator has gone through a turnaround recently | Source: @woonomic
From the chart, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin network flows had been following an overall downward trajectory earlier when the consolidation was taking place, but recently, capital injections into the coin have once again been on the rise.

This is a similar trend to what was observed earlier in the year during the crash following the approval of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The turnabout in capital inflows back then was what led into the rally that took the cryptocurrency to the current ATH.
BTC Price
Bitcoin had seen a pullback under $66,000 yesterday, raising worries that the recovery surge had already fizzled out. This drop only lasted briefly, though, as the coin has returned above $67,000 today.

Analyst Declares This Week Is The Most Important Week In Cryptocurrency History In The US - And Explains Why - Bitcoin Sistemi

Blockchain Association official Ron Hammond declared this week as the most important week for cryptocurrencies in the US capital, in a statement today.
Crypto Bill Awaits Presidential Decision
SAB 121 CRA, a crypto bill that garnered a staggering 60 votes in the Senate, is currently on President Biden's desk, awaiting his decision by May 28. The bill received support from both the House Speaker and the Senate Majority Leader. Despite Biden's first sign that he would veto the bill before it votes in the House of Representatives, strong support from top Democrats in the Senate has put the White House in a difficult position.


Another bill that Biden initially signaled he would veto, the DC Crime CRA, became law after a significant defection from most members of his own party. This precedent suggests the possibility of Biden reversing his stance on SAB 121 CRA. Increasing understanding of the importance of cryptocurrencies for many voters, especially young voters, may also affect this decision.
FIT21: A New Regulatory Framework
This week will also mark a major milestone with the House of Representatives scheduled to vote on FIT21, a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework. Talks will begin Wednesday, with a vote expected late Wednesday afternoon or early Thursday. Given the SEC's unsuccessful arguments against a crypto framework, the bill is expected to receive significant bipartisan support.





A year ago, the SEC argued that the rules were clear, the laws did not need to be updated, and that they had not been defeated in court in all crypto cases. However, their recent defeats in the courts, lack of action against bad examples like FTX, and involvement in high-profile crypto cases have shown that the current status quo is not working.
The FIT21 vote could see a rare strong bipartisan vote in a fractured Congress. The level of support will determine whether the bill has any traction in the Senate, which is less concerned with the crypto market structure.



ETH ETF Decision Approaching
On the same day as the FIT21 vote, the SEC will make a decision on the Ethereum ETF for Ark Invest and VanEck. Many political signals and public comments from issuers lead many to believe it will be rejected.
This week offers three opportunities for the Biden Administration to clarify its stance on crypto. This week could be a defining moment for crypto policy in the US as crypto becomes an increasingly important topic for many young Americans. As Hammond noted, “This bull run is not about memecoins, it is about policy gains.”

                        AUK High Court judge ruled against Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist who had repeatedly claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, on May 19.UK Court Rules Against Craig Wright’s Claims
In a 231-page ruling, Judge James Mellor unequivocally stated that Wright “lied to the court repeatedly” and that his claim to be Nakamoto is “his biggest lie.”The judgment stems from a lawsuit filed by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), representing major cryptocurrency and blockchain firms.COPA sought declaratory relief to prevent Wright from pursuing copyright claims over the Bitcoin codebase and white paper based on his alleged status as Satoshi Nakamoto.Judge Mellor methodically dismantled Wright’s case, describing it as “riddled with inconsistencies and absurd explanations.”Mellor accused Wright of forging documents and submitting fake evidence “on a grand scale” in his failed effort to prove he authored the Satoshi white paper and mined the first Bitcoins in 2009.“Dr. Wright has not proved that he is Satoshi Nakamoto,” Mellor bluntly concluded. “He has deliberately attempted to deceive the court on this specific issue.”The judge’s assessment represents a major credibility blow to Wright, who has brought numerous copyright infringement lawsuits premised on being Bitcoin’s creator.Questions Over Craig Wright’s Litigation Funding And Hodlonaut’s Reaction to the Verdict
Following the judge’s ruling, the question about who Wright’s financier was in his years of legal tussle still lingers. There is an unconfirmed rumor that online gambling tycoon Calvin Ayre is his major financier, even though the billionaire voiced skepticism about the authenticity of Wright’s claim.Meanwhile, Hodlonaut, a well-known Bitcoin maximalist previously sued by Wright for libel over calling him a “fraud,” took to social media to reiterate his stance.Resurrecting a hashtag he hadn’t used since 2019, Hodlonaut took to X to share excerpts from the court’s written judgment, highlighting how the judge deemed Wright’s claims to be an “intricate web of lies.”The judge’s scathing remarks included assertions that Wright is “not nearly as clever as he thinks he is” and that he “lied to the court repeatedly,” with most of his lies and forged documents supporting “his biggest lie” of being Satoshi Nakamoto.Hodlonaut also quoted the judge’s observation that Wright engaged in “the deliberate production of false documents to support false claims and use the Courts as a vehicle for fraud” across multiple jurisdictions.The conclusive rejection of Wright’s claims comes after a legal battle that lasted almost five years.During this time, Wright sued Hodlonaut for libel over social media posts that called him a “scammer” and a “fraud” for falsely claiming to be Bitcoin’s inventor.Recall that Wright dropped his defamation appeal against Hodlonaut in April 2024 after initially losing the defamation lawsuit in October 2023.

Launch a Memecoin on Base with Basecamp | Bankless


It’s memecoin season, and with the growing interest here we’ve seen a rise in “memecoin launcher” projects. The idea? These do-it-yourself platforms make it easy to create and deploy your own memecoins in a streamlined and secure fashion. I’ve covered a couple of these projects so far, like Pump.fun and Party, and more are launching every week. A new one that caught my eye this month is Basecamp. Pump.fun Hit for $2M in Flash Loan Exploit on BanklessSolana’s buzzy memecoin launcher hit with attack.Created by the builders at Sudoswap (one of my favorite protocol teams), Basecamp is a 1-click memecoin deployer with no launch costs except the ETH you need for gas. Specifically, Basecamp is tailored for releasing memecoins on Uniswap’s Base deployment. Typically, you would need upfront capital to create a liquidity pool (LP) for a new token, but Basecamp lets you set up a pool without any initial liquidity provided. It also locks the liquidity to prevent rugging, and it lets creators keep 5% of a token’s supply and earn 66% of all accrued LP fees. Pretty cool, right? Well, if you’re interested in exploring, it’s straightforward to dive in. First, head to basecamp.wtf and connect a wallet. Note, you might notice wallets like MetaMask, Rainbow, Rabby, etc. throw a “warning” message when you go to connect. This is a common precaution with new sites and is meant to be a first line of defense against nefarious platforms. Sudoswap is legit so you can ignore here, but feel free to sign in with a burner wallet if you’d like to go the extra mile!Once you’re logged in, you can start reviewing new and trending tokens on Basecamp or press the “Launch Token” button to start setting up your own. Clicking into an already existing token will bring you to an interface where you can review that coin’s main liquidity and activity stats or link out to trade on the associated Uniswap pool, like so:As for creating your own memecoin, the “Launch Token” button on the homepage will take you to a modal where you can input your token’s desired name, ticker, supply, and starting market cap. Remember, you don’t have to supply ETH for this market cap; instead Basecamp adjusts your LP size to target your choice. I was able to create a coin in less than one minute with less than $1 of gas.When you’re ready to proceed, press “Launch Token,” complete the deploy transaction with your wallet, and voila: your memecoin will now be live on Uniswap and Base.At this point, you’ll be taken to the token profile of your coin. This interface offers an admin panel where you’ll be able to claim LP fees going forward if your token gains any traction. Of course, keep in mind that Basecamp is brand new, and there is no guarantee that any tokens you create here will have any lasting success. What the platform has going for it, though, is that it’s arguably the easiest, fastest, and cheapest place to deploy memecoins today, and that’s nothing to sneeze at. It took me longer to write the first few sentences of this post than it took me to launch the example MMT token above!Accordingly, Basecamp democratizes access to token creation and can potentially fuel a new wave of creative and community-driven projects on Base. In the meantime, it’s a great resource to bookmark for your onchain toolbox—don’t sleep on it!

Is the SEC’s expected spot ether ETF denial priced in? - Blockworks


Industry watchers seem to agree that if US regulators approve spot ether ETFs, it would be a bullish development for the asset. What’s more, they believe that even if these ETFs are not approved, the impact on the market will not be significantly negative.
That is in part due to market participants’ low expectations that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve such funds this time around. 
The SEC has until May 23 to rule on a proposed ETH fund by VanEck. Its deadline for a similar planned offering from Ark Invest and 21Shares is the next day.
Segment observers expect, like with bitcoin ETFs, that the securities regulator will rule on all the ETH fund applications at once.   
Ether’s price was about $3,140 at 2:30 pm ET Monday — up about 7% from a week ago but a far cry from its year-to-date high above $4,000 in mid-March.
A spot ether ETF approval decision would spur immediate price appreciation and a medium-term new all-time high above $4,800, according to Jeff Embry, managing partner of crypto hedge fund Globe 3 Capital.
“The difference between the bitcoin [ETF] approval and ETH’s possible approval, is that the market had fully expected the bitcoin approval and had pre-priced it, thus causing an initial sell off on the news,” Embry told Blockworks.
Contrarily, various industry watchers have said they expect the SEC to deny ether ETFs this month. 
Reasons include the SEC’s hesitation to clearly label ether as a security or a commodity, the regulator’s lack of engagement with prospective issuers in recent weeks and the slightly weaker correlation between the ether spot and futures markets compared to bitcoin.
It also took Grayscale Investments’ legal victory against the SEC to help get US spot bitcoin ETFs approved — something some lawyers said might be needed before ether funds get the green light. 
Read more: Why the SEC could choose to deny ether ETFs, and what could happen next
The expected SEC rejection of spot ether ETFs is reflected in ETH’s roughly 20% price dip since mid-March, Embry noted.
“If the SEC denies the ETH ETF, we would expect to see an initial sell off of 5% to 12%, but short lived, as the bull market is a much more powerful driver of pricing and will ultimately move pricing up,” the executive added.
Indeed, the approval of an Ethereum ETF next week is viewed as a low probability event, and ether is priced as such, said LMAX Group market strategist Joel Kruger.
There might be room for ETH to drop lower in the case of a denial — though such a downtrend should not exceed 10%, he added.  
“If on the other hand the market is surprised with an approval, we could see the price of ETH surge by some 30% in the immediate aftermath,” Kruger said, “with such a move setting the stage for a run to retest the 2021 record high in the weeks that follow.”

Institutions Pour $932,000,000 Into Crypto Products Amid Prospect of Interest Rate Cuts: CoinShares - The Daily Hodl


								Digital assets manager CoinShares says institutions poured nearly a billion dollars into crypto products last week in response to Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.
In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, CoinShares says digital asset investment products raked in $932 million in net inflows last week despite trading volumes being down approximately 75% from March.










“Interestingly, the inflows were an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI report on Wednesday, with the latter three trading days of the week making up 89% of the total flows, highlighting our view that Bitcoin prices have recoupled to interest rate expectations.”
Source: CoinShares
In terms of regional inflows, the US provided the lion’s share at $1 billion.
“Switzerland and Germany also saw minor inflows of $27 million and $4.2 million respectively, while Hong Kong and Canada saw outflows totaling $83 million and $17 million respectively.”
While short Bitcoin (BTC) investment products saw little engagement, BTC enjoyed $942 million in inflows, suggesting bullish sentiment amongst investors, according to CoinShares
In terms of altcoins, Solana (SOL), Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA) brought in $4.9 million, $3.7 million and $1.9 million in inflows, respectively, while Ethereum (ETH) suffered $23.3 million in outflows, bringing ETH’s total year-to-date outflows to $57 million.
“Ethereum continues to suffer from bearishness over the prospects for an SEC approval of a spot-based ETF this week…”

Change at the Top of Grayscale: Michael Sonnenshein Resigns

Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale, has decided to resign from his role, raising several questions about the reasons behind this decision. According to the company, Sonnenshein is leaving his position to “pursue other interests”. This move has sparked a series of speculations and discussions within the investment and cryptocurrency industry.
Sonnenshein has been a key figure in the growth and development of Grayscale, one of the largest digital asset managers in the world. During his tenure, the company has seen significant expansion, especially with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), one of Grayscale’s most popular products. However, despite the success of GBTC, the fund has recently faced some challenges.
One of the main issues concerns the spot bitcoin ETF GBTC, which has seen the exit of numerous investors despite an increase in overall inflows. This phenomenon could be attributed to several factors, including the volatility of the cryptocurrency market and concerns regarding regulation. Although Grayscale has sought approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States to convert the GBTC into an ETF, this goal has not yet been achieved, adding further uncertainty for investors.
The departure of Sonnenshein comes at a crucial time for Grayscale, which is trying to navigate through these challenges and consolidate its position in the digital asset market. His exit could be seen as a signal of strategic change within the company. However, the exact reasons behind Sonnenshein’s decision remain unclear. Some analysts suggest that increasing pressure and high expectations may have played a role in his decision to resign.

The new CEO of Grayscale
To take on the role of CEO will be Peter Mintzberg, a former executive of Goldman Sachs. Mintzberg will join the team of Grayscale on August 15, 2024. His appointment has been met with interest and curiosity, given his extensive experience in the traditional financial sector. During his time at Goldman Sachs, Mintzberg held various leadership roles, accumulating a deep knowledge of financial markets and investment dynamics.
The arrival of Mintzberg could represent a new era for Grayscale, bringing with him a fresh perspective and innovative strategies. His experience could prove valuable in addressing current and future challenges, especially in a market environment that is constantly evolving like that of cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, his appointment could strengthen investor confidence, reassuring them about Grayscale’s ability to navigate through market turbulence.
Mintzberg will have the task of leading Grayscale through a period of transition, trying to balance the needs of investors with market dynamics. His leadership will be crucial for the company, which will have to face significant regulatory and competitive challenges. In addition, he will have to work to obtain SEC approval for the long-awaited ETF on bitcoin, a step that could radically transform Grayscale’s position in the cryptocurrency investment sector.
Conclusions
In conclusion, Michael Sonnenshein’s resignation as CEO of Grayscale marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter for the company. Peter Mintzberg’s entry brings new opportunities and challenges. Mintzberg’s ability to quickly adapt and implement effective strategies will be crucial for the future of Grayscale. Investors and the cryptocurrency market will closely watch the upcoming developments, trying to understand how the company will face the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities under the new leadership.

Bitcoin ETFs Are Back With Nearly $1 Billion In Fresh Cash - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin bounced back strongly from its April slump last week, boosting the performance of newly launched Bitcoin spot ETFs.On May 15, the price of BTC surged from $61,800 to $66,000, and is now trading for over $68,500 for the first time in over a month, per CoinGecko data. Meanwhile, net inflows to Bitcoin investment products globally exceeded $942 million, dwarfing $144 million from the previous week—and reversing four straight weeks of net outflows before that. According to CoinShares, the sudden resurgence in Bitcoin demand is directly related to evolving macroeconomic conditions. “The inflows were an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI report on Wednesday, with the latter three trading days of the week making up 89% of the total flows,” the firm’s Head of Research, James Butterfill, wrote in a Monday blog post.Bitcoin price movements have historically correlated with central bank policy expectations, with prices rising as interest rates fall, and vice versa. With April CPI inflation rising just 0.3 percent month over month, markets have renewed confidence that the Fed may soon conclude its battle to slow rising prices across the country. That should bring lower interest rates, cheaper debt, and higher valuations for both stocks and crypto. According to CME FedWatch, markets are 50% confident that the Fed will first lower interest rates by 25 basis points in September. Aside from the changing macro outlook, numerous major U.S. investors disclosed allocations to Bitcoin spot ETFs as part of mandatory 13F filings this month. By the end of Q1, exactly 944 unique filers—each of which controls over $100 million in assets—reported owning $10.7 billion worth of Bitcoin ETF shares. Those holdings make up over 20% of total assets in those ETFs. One such investor included the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which held $163 million in BTC across BlackRock and Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETFs as of March 31. As a whole, the pension fund held $155 billion in assets as of Q4 2023.In a memo last week, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said the filings had him “incredibly bullish” on the ETFs, since those massive asset managers who had already invested would likely allocate more over time. “Hightower Advisors may have $68 million allocated to Bitcoin ETFs today, for instance, which is great, but it’s just 0.05% of their assets,” he noted. If that were to eventually grow to 1%—as is typical of most investors, in Hougan’s view—that would mean a $1.2 billion allocation from Hightower alone. In other Bitcoin ETF news, Michael Sonnhenshein, CEO of the world’s largest such fund, Grayscale, stepped down from his position on Monday, saying “the crypto asset class is at an important inflection point and this is the right moment for a smooth transition.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Institutions Ramp Up Crypto Exposure As Weekly Volume Plummets: CoinShares - The Defiant

Large entities recorded inflows of $932 million, mostly in response to U.S. CPI data.
Weekly inflows into digital asset funds climbed by the most since late March even as volumes dropped, according to CoinShares’ latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report.Major institutions added $932 million in cryptocurrency to their portfolios last week, the report said, while volume dropped by 75% from March to $10.5 billion. The seven days ended on May 19 mark the second weekly inflow in a row after four weeks of outflows.The additional $932 million brings the yearly total for institutions to a whopping $13.8 billion.An age-old adage dubbed “sell in May and go away” appears to be in full force. Seasonal behavior among traders, with activity dropping as summer approaches, explains lower volumes. Meanwhile, inflows remain strong as institutions continue to load up on digital assets thanks to spot ETFs.The disparity, according to James Butterfill, head of Research at CoinShares, “signifies that the hype around the launch is over and now it's trading more on fundamentals.” He told The Defiant, however, that volume continues to be higher than the $2 billion weekly average from 2023.Last week, major firms responded swiftly to the U.S. CPI report that showed signs of inflation beginning to slow down, leading to a significant bounce in prices across the crypto market. On May 15, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that consumer prices had dropped for the first time in six months.Butterfill added that the latter three days of trading–once the report had been published–represented 89% of all institutional trading, “highlighting our view that Bitcoin prices have recoupled to interest rate expectations.”Grayscale Stumps AnalystAfter suffering $16.6 billion in outflows since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF on Jan. 11, Grayscale saw minor inflows the past week for the first time, increasing its crypto holdings by $18 million.“I’m stumped regarding Grayscale,” said Butterfill. “It's a much higher cost product, my only idea is that every ETF needs due diligence, and if you already have an issuer onboarded it saves a whole load of due diligence for a fund manager.”So why are investors using it? “Simply ease of access,” he said.It'a All About BitcoinBitcoin was most favored by large firms with $942 million in inflows on the week, hinting at an overall positive sentiment. Over the course of the month, institutions have accumulated $790 million in BTC, which brings the yearly total to $13.5 billion.On the other hand, the least favored asset by big funds continues to be Ethereum. The asset registered outflows worth $23 million, notching the monthly total to $46 million offloaded. Year to date, $57 million has left institutional coffers.Most other cryptocurrencies registered minor accumulation from institutions. Large players added $4.9 million in SOL over the past week, along with $3.7 million in Chainlink, and $1.9 million in XRP.Entities from the United States continue to dominate over their European, Asian, and Latin American counterparts. More than $1 billion in inflows went to U.S.-based funds, while Hong Kong turned bearish with $82 million exiting companies.

                        Major blockchain company Ripple has faced multiple criticisms over its increasing sales of the XRP token. On May 19, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, explained why the company was selling its XRP holdings.Ripple’s XRP Holdings and Escrow Release Strategy
Schwartz’s comments were in response to a thread that criticized Ripple’s large XRP holdings and sales strategy.As detailed in its Q1 2024 report, Ripple’s XRP holdings are divided into two main categories: liquid and available XRP in Ripple’s wallets and XRP locked in escrow accounts set for controlled release over 42 months.As of March 31, 2024, Ripple held 4.8 billion XRP tokens directly, while another 40.1 billion XRP were locked in escrow.A portion of escrowed XRP is released each month, though most are subsequently returned to reset the escrow clock.Schwartz portrayed the sales as Ripple’s only viable option for accessing liquidity from its XRP holdings besides letting the tokens sit indefinitely. The company has not indicated plans to halt or dramatically ramp up the sales.In response to Schwartz’s revelations about Ripple’s XRP sales, an anonymous crypto researcher known as Darkhorse urged the company to reconsider its strategies. One suggestion was temporarily halting sales to gauge the price impact.Schwartz stressed the importance of transparency in Ripple’s actions, asserting that deliberate price manipulation would be unethical.Some users asked Schwartz if Ripple might change its approach in the future. They also suggested that Ripple’s large XRP holdings might discourage developers from building network projects. This doesn’t seem to be the case. As CryptoNews reported, XRP Ledger transactions jumped 100% in the first quarter of 2024.As the third-largest crypto by market cap, XRP is trading around $0.50 per token, down from recent highs around $0.80. After an upward price trend from May 2023 to April 2024, XRP has pulled back around 22% and is currently testing support levels. At press time, XRP trades at $0.517.SEC Criticized for Aggressive Stance on Crypto Firms
Ripple’s legal tussle with the SEC continues, and there is no end in sight. In a recent filing, the blockchain company pushed back against the regulator’s demand for a $2 billion penalty fee, which it deems excessive and overly punitive.Ripple’s argument is simple – the penalty demanded by the SEC is not justifiable since there were no accusations of reckless or fraudulent behavior.“In a case that had no allegations (or findings) of recklessness or fraud, and in which Ripple won on significant issues, the SEC’s task is just more evidence of its ongoing intimidation against all of crypto in the U.S,” Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty explained.The SEC has been getting a lot of flak lately for its crackdown on crypto firms. Recall that Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal had called on other crypto companies to query the regulator’s previous actions, citing the SEC’s case against Debt Box. Grewal believes the SEC’s departure from its usual processes raises questions about the validity of its claims and possible abuse of power.

A Milestone in the Cryptocurrency Market - 2 Billion Dollar Deal Approved by Judge - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a critical decision, a New York bankruptcy judge gave the green light to a $2 billion settlement between the New York State Attorney General's Office and crypto lender Genesis.
The approval comes several months after Genesis filed a petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York seeking Judge Sean Lane's approval of the settlement.


New York Attorney General Letitia James expressed her satisfaction with the result in her statement today. “When investors suffer losses due to fraud and manipulation, they deserve to be compensated,” James said.

“This historic settlement is an important step towards ensuring that victims who invested in Genesis have a piece of justice.”


The settlement, the largest settlement against a crypto firm in state history, includes a victim fund designed to assist New York investors who contributed more than $1.1 billion to Genesis through its Gemini Earn program.





The lawsuit was first filed by Attorney General James against Bitcoin exchange Gemini, Genesis, and later its parent company, Digital Currency Group, over Gemini's cryptocurrency lending program. Genesis and Gemini offered the program to individual investors in 2021 and promised the opportunity to earn returns of up to 7.4 percent.

But while the craze appears to have died down, coins like Dogecoin—the leading meme coin by market cap—are still winners.The price of Dogecoin over the past seven days has risen nearly 2%, according to CoinGecko. The Elon Musk favorite and 10th biggest digital asset by market cap is now priced at $0.153, having jumped 2% in the past 24 hours as well.Meanwhile, GameStop (GME), the original meme stock, has shed nearly 35% of its value in the same timeframe.It's now priced at $19.80, down from a closing price of $30.45 on Monday, May 13.Internet star and financial analyst Roaring Kitty, whose real name is Keith Gill, posted on Twitter for the first time in nearly three years on May 12.
