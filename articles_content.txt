Bitcoin Sends Bullish Signals on Short Intervals: Will it Break Resistance? | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin is aggressively testing the upper liquidity limits as market watchers spot an upcoming “golden cross” on the horizon. The latest data points reveal Bitcoin near its peak levels since the middle of April, maintaining sustained pressure.Analyzing the Golden Cross PotentialThe concept of the golden cross, where a shorter-term moving average crosses over a longer-term one, signals potential upticks in price movements.Moustache, a noted figure in the crypto trading community, anticipates this technical event on the 12-hour Bitcoin chart.“Golden Cross of $BTC is imminent,” he shared on Twitter, indicating the market might see significant activity similar to the last occurrence in October, which preceded a major price rally. Back then, BTC surged over 170% following the golden cross.You Might Be Interested In: BITCOIN PRICE PREDICTION 2024-2030: WILL BTC PRICE SURPASS $100K POST-HALVING?Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price resistance around $67,000 holds strong, with approximately $75 million worth capping the potential rise, according to CoinGlass data.Despite not reaching the highs of 2024 or 2021, the anticipation in the market is palpable, influenced heavily by these technical formations.Ichimoku Cloud Confirms Support ChangeThe trading pattern seems reminiscent of earlier in the year, as suggested by another trader, Titan of Crypto.“BTC seems to be repeating the same pattern from early 2024,” he observed, noting over 60% gains when similar conditions were met previously.The Ichimoku Cloud, a complex indicator used to gauge momentum and future areas of support and resistance, now suggests $60,000 as a new support level.This change from resistance to support aligns with various bullish indicators converging around this pivotal price point.The short-term holder realized price and the swiftly ascending 100-day moving average, now above $62,000, further bolster this support level.“BTC is perfectly flipping previous resistance into support,” summarized Titan of Crypto, presenting an optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency.There is a Surging Interest in Bitcoin ETFsMarket dynamics are also influenced by institutional behaviors, particularly observed in Bitcoin ETF activities.Recent data from Santiment highlight a surge in volumes among Bitcoin’s institutional investment products, with daily spot volumes exceeding $5 billion.Read Also: EL SALVADOR MINES 474 BITCOIN USING GEOTHERMAL VOLCANIC ENERGYThis week, the volume managed by the seven largest U.S. spot ETFs reached a high of $5.65 billion, the most robust since late March.Moreover, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which had seen significant outflows in the past, is now witnessing renewed interest, with recent investments totaling up to $31.6 million over two days.“Gone are the days of whales only accumulating onchain,” commented Santiment, suggesting a broadening of investor base and activity.In a compelling show of confidence, 937 U.S. firms reported exposure to Bitcoin ETFs in the first quarter of the year, dwarfing the interest seen in gold ETFs during their initial launch period, which only attracted 95 firms. This confirms the growing institutional trust and investment in BTC as a viable financial asset.As Bitcoin continues to send bullish signals across these short intervals, the market remains watchful. Will it manage to break through the existing resistance levels? The data and trends suggest a bullish outlook, but as always, the crypto market retains its unpredictable nature.

Arbitrum DAO Launches M&A Pilot to Boost DeFi Expansion


Arbitrum DAO has entered on a pioneering mergers and acquisitions (M&A) pilot program. This move leverages its $3 billion treasury for growth and innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi). 
The initiative, which received overwhelming approval from DAO members, highlights Arbitrum’s commitment to exploring new avenues to enhance its ecosystem.
Strategic M&A Initiative Begins

Bernard Schmid, a founding partner at Areta, is leading the eight-week pilot program. Areta provides investment banking services to crypto companies. 

“In addition to conducting an in-depth strategy study on the value upside of M&A, the pilot phase should serve as a facilitated platform for in-depth discussions based on data rather than opinions,” he emphasized.

The M&A pilot will form a dedicated unit with a budget of $100 million to $250 million. This unit will identify and acquire potential targets over two years. Participants will explore the fundamentals of DAO/DeFi M&A, discuss target areas, assess risks, and develop a conceptual framework.

Assessing Arbitrum’s Financial Strength
Arbitrum, Ethereum’s largest Layer 2, possesses the second-largest Treasury among DeFi projects. financial strength positions it uniquely to explore rare M&A opportunities in the crypto space. GlobalData shows only seven M&A deals occurred in the crypto sector during Q4 2023, compared to 1,069 in the broader technology sector. 
Status of M&A in Crypto. Source: Arbitrum DAO
Schmid’s vision includes acquiring technological talent and investing in complementary infrastructure to accelerate Arbitrum’s strategic goals.

“This is a largely untapped opportunity in crypto, only explored by a few different projects in the space; therefore, delving deeper into M&A would enable Arbitrum to get a jump-start on its competitors,” he stated. 


However, some members of the Arbitrum community have expressed cautious optimism. Krzysztof Urbański, a delegate from L2BEAT, expressed uncertainty about whether there are sufficient M&A opportunities for the DAO to achieve the scale outlined in the original proposal.
Historically, crypto M&A has seen both successes and failures. Polygon’s acquisition of Mir and Hermez advanced its technology, showing the benefits of strategic acquisitions. Klaytn and Finschia, two large L1 blockchains in Asia, recently merged in February 2024. With a combined market cap of ~$887M and over 410,000 Web3 members, this merger positioned them as Asia’s leading blockchain by integrating infrastructure, burning 23.6% of tokens, and establishing large-scale Web3 governance. Conversely, Fei Protocol’s merger with Rari Capital was controversial, highlighting the risks.

The Arbitrum M&A pilot aims to mitigate these risks through comprehensive exploration and structured planning. It could set a precedent for M&A in the crypto sector, attracting interest from other DAOs and traditional financial institutions.

Terra Luna Classic Price Prediction as Binance Burns 59 Billion Tokens - $10 LUNC Incoming?

                        LUNC has declined by 1% in the past 24 hours, with the Terra Luna Classic price dropping $0.000108 as the wider crypto market gains by a very slight 0.5% today.The altcoin is now up by 1% in a week and by 6.5% in a month, while it sits on a fairly unspectacular 16% gain in a year.While the latter percentage is underwhelming relative to bigger tokens, the coin’s moves today come as Binance burns just over 1 billion LUNC, bringing the exchange’s burn total to 59 billion.This brings the total burn to 113.3 billion LUNC, and with the Terra Luna Classic community still working on increasing the burn count and enhancing the coin’s utility, we could see more price gains soon.Terra Luna Classic Price Prediction as Binance Burns 59 Billion Tokens – $10 LUNC Incoming?
LUNC’s price has stabilized a little in the past hour, leaving its indicators in a position that would suggest incoming gains.For example, its relative strength index (purple) has risen to 60 after dipping below 50 earlier this morning, creating the possibility of gains over the weekend as it rises towards 70.Source: TradingViewMeanwhile, its 30-day average (orange) has resumed rising further above the 200-day (blue), regaining momentum after a lull over the past couple of days.While LUNC is doing well relative to its recent history, it should be remembered that its volume is basically minuscule in relation to the volumes of major tokens.At $21 million, its 75% down from where it was during the first week of May, and a whopping 97.5% down from its levels in early March.This indicates a distinct lack of interest in LUNC from the wider crypto market, which seems to remain skeptical as to the coin’s long-term viability.Despite such negativity, Terra Luna Classic continues to take modest steps towards making itself more attractive as an asset, with Binance burning over 1 billion LUNC yesterday.The exchange has now burned 59 billion in total, with the total LUNC burn count reaching 113 billion overall.However, this amounts to only 1.66% of the overall LUNC supply, which perhaps explains why recent burns haven’t had much of an impact on the coin’s price.Even so, they raise the prospect of LUNC making steady progress over the coming months, with the Terra Luna Classic community continuing to debate and (occasionally) accept proposals for improving the coin’s viability.As such, the Terra Luna Classic price could reach $0.00015 in the next few weeks, and $0.0003 by Q4 2024.Small-Cap Meme Tokens Show More Potential
Because LUNC remains a kind of semi-dormant token, many traders may prefer to look to alternatives with more potential in the near term.Such potential could come from new meme coins, with several such tokens holding their presales at the moment and accumulating lots of momentum.This includes WienerAI (WAI), a new Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has now raised $2 million in its presale.What’s interesting about WienerAI is that it’s more than a mere meme token, with the coin native to an AI-based trading bot that can answer trade-related questions and offer investment advice.The bot will help investors identify coins with strong potential, while also helping traders time buys and sells.On top of this, it will also including an atomic swap feature, so that users can quickly trade any coin recommended by the bot.There’s also a very helpful function related to avoiding front-running bots, so that traders can stay ahead of the market and avoid losing uot.So given that WAI is the native utility token of the WienerAI bot, it will grow in parallel with the growth of the latter.It will have a max supply 69 billion tokens, while holders will also be able to stake the coin for a passive income.VIDEO Investors can participate in its sale at the official WienerAI website, where 1 WAI is selling for $0.000708.Given the coin’s fundamentals, it will likely supersede this low price once it lists on exchanges in the next few weeks.Buy WAI Today

                        Fantom ($FTM) has outperformed all other Layer 1 tokens this week and risen 10% amidst a flurry of recent activity on the network, with FTM trading at $0.80 at the time of writing.cCrypto’s two biggest coins, also Layer 1 coins, couldn’t keep the pace over the seven days.Bitcoin ($BTC) grew 5% over the week to trade at $66,234 while Ethereum (ETH remains virtually unchanged at around $3,020.The main reason investors are piling into Fantom right now is anticipation for the network’s new Sonic upgrade. Sonic will boost the network’s throughput from current levels of between 1.5 to 2.5 transactions per second to 2,000 tps.Fantom says the network will be upgraded once the new software hits two thirds of the validator nodes. As of today, 25 of 60 nodes have upgraded to Sonic.On Fantom’s chart for the last three months, we can see a marked decline since mid-March, in line with Bitcoin’s fall from a recent all-time high set that time.For the last month, FTM has been caught in a narrow price range of between $0.60 and $0.80 so today’s price could be the first sign of a breakout.It’s supported by a stable Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 54.With the weekend coming up, it’s important to see how the price plays out over the weekend for some insight into how the week will unfold.Diversify Fantom and Layer 1 Holdings With Meme Coin Trading Bot Companion WienerAI
Investing in a Layer 1 token is essentially betting on a network and all the projects sitting on it.Investors who recognize the technical capabilities of Fantom or Ethereum are more confident in these blockchains as robust platforms for DeFi applications, compared to those who invest without such knowledge.Both Fantom and Ethereum are made to scale and are constantly optimizing.However, Layer 1 tokens can have more subdued rallies, since they’re a bet on whole ecosystems rather than single projects.That’s why it’s always good to diversify Fantom and other Layer 1 token holdings with tokens underpinning some of the specific applications built on a blockchain.On the surface, WienerAI looks like a meme coin, but it’s a bit more than that.It’s a doggy leap into blockchain’s great potential once AI comes on-chain.The presale is only a month old, and it has already taken a tidy $2 million in investments.Touted as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner”, WienerAI ($WAI) is a digital companion that gives its owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees.Blockchain security platform Coinsult audited WienerAI’s smart contract.Around 20% of $WAI’s supply is for staking.WienerAI’s website offers buyers the ability to stake during the presale, in order to take advantage of the lucrative yield, which is currently 485% APY.Stay on top of WienerAI news over on X and Telegram.Join the presale now over on the WienerAI website.

Ethereum ETF Approval Coming Sooner Rather Than Later, Says Coinbase - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsA spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) could hit the market sooner than expected, says Coinbase, despite growing industry observer pessimism.In a note this week, America’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange said that “while there is uncertainty around a timely approval given the SEC’s apparent silence with issuers,” it’s only a matter of time before such a product hits the market. There’s a long list of top asset managers—including VanEck, BlackRock, and Franklin Templeton—who have filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to release an Ethereum ETF. Such a product would give investors exposure to ETH, the second biggest digital coin by market cap, via shares that trade on a stock exchange.But Wall Street’s biggest regulator has been slow to give a response to applicants, and has pushed back decision deadlines, echoing its earlier approach to spot Bitcoin ETF approvals before finally pulling the trigger in January.This is usually normal in the ETF application process, but the SEC’s reluctance to talk about the investment vehicles has led analysts from the likes of Bloomberg and CoinShares to say that such crypto funds would not get the green light by the May deadline.“As crypto begins to take form as an election issue, it’s also less certain in our view that the SEC would be willing to front the political capital necessary to support a denial,” wrote David Han, institutional research analyst at Coinbase.“Even if the first deadline on May 23, 2024 encounters a rejection,” he added, “we think there is a high likelihood that litigation could reverse that decision.”Last year, crypto fund manager Grayscale won an appeal against the SEC to convert its Bitcoin fund into a spot ETF in a high-profile case.The SEC then reluctantly said yes to 11 Bitcoin ETFs on January 10. The investment products have since been massively successful, taking in billions of dollars of inflows. Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Australian BitConnect promoter pleads guilty years after wife disappears


John Bigatton has pleaded guilty in Australia to a criminal charge of providing financial advice without the appropriate license for his role in promoting the failed Ponzi scheme BitConnect. 
BitConnect was a Ponzi scheme masquerading as a lending platform that offered people unsustainable yields on its token, BCC. Users were able to lend the token to the platform with the promise the funds were being deployed profitably. However, the rewards were inauthentic and the scheme eventually collapsed leaving investors without access to their funds. 
Bigatton actively promoted this scheme from his social media as well as hosting ‘seminars’ around Australia, serving as national promoter for Australia for BitConnect.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) was aided in its investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 
The FBI was also involved in the investigation into BitConnect founder Satish Kumbhani, who was indicted in the Southern District of California.

Earlier reporting from Sunday Night paints Bigatton as a consummate hustler who had previously tried selling vitamins, running a gym, trading foreign currencies — anything that promised a big return.
Eventually, he saw the promised returns of BitConnect and joined up, encouraging a variety of other Australians to join the scheme.  
Bigatton’s wife, Madeline, also disappeared as the Ponzi scheme collapsed, with some of her family worrying that she was murdered. 
Bigatton faces sentencing on July 5 of this year.

Coinbase Gets Upgrade: Analyst Highlights Larger Audience, New Spot ETFs, Less Focus On Meme Coins - Coinbase Glb (NASDAQ:COIN) - Benzinga

BofA Securities analyst Mark McLaughlin upgraded Coinbase Global, Inc COIN to Neutral from Underperform, raising the price forecast to $217 from $110.According to the analyst, the upgrade was driven by retail reengagement of crypto and operating leverage following prior expense cuts. Risks, however, included ongoing regulatory overhang and near-term dependence on transaction revenue for profitability.Per the analyst, the current macro environment has been a positive for cryptocurrency market cap appreciation and trading volumes.The present market situation is more robust given the larger audience of investors, including institutional, new spot ETFs, and more maturation of brokerage services.The market also gained from a greater focus on a concentrated set of mature coins (top 10 coins make up 83% of market cap vs. 73% in November 2021) with less focus on meme coins.Coinbase’s expense discipline and ability to benefit from operating leverage following significant expense cuts in 2022 will help it maintain profitability in the future, the analyst wrote.Over the 2022-2023 “crypto winter,” Coinbase significantly reduced its cost base to more appropriate levels, aiming to reach profitability amidst a precipitous decline in transaction volumes and revenue.In addition, increased diversification of revenue sources less correlated with overall volumes should dampen earnings volatility.The analyst did warn about regulatory overhang surrounding U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit and timeline. While the analyst does not see any major update for the rest of the year but expects a trial in 2025 that will add more clarity on future regulation.COIN Price Action: Coinbase shares are trading higher by 5.31% to $209.74 at last check Friday.Photo Rafapress on Shutterstock

Robinhood Sees Surge in Trading as Bull Market Returns, Analyst Upgrades Stock - Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) - Benzinga

Robinhood Markets Inc HOOD shares are trading higher after B&A Securities analyst Craig Siegenthaler upgraded the stock from Underperform to Buy and raised its price target from $14 to $24.Siegenthaler noted the current entry point as very different from 2021 when he first initiated on HOOD with an Underperform. Now, interest rates are elevated, and the BofA economists forecast Fed rate cuts to start in December. Also Read: Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev Dishes On Hot Retirement Offerings: ‘Economics Of The Offer Are Irresistible To Pass Up’The analyst said economic growth is surprising to the upside, and stock and crypto markets are back in bull market territory. Robust retail engagement will benefit HOOD on multiple fronts, including accelerating near-term organic growth, higher trading activity driving rising payment for order flow, and margin loan balances, which are the most profitable asset on HOOD’s balance sheet, he noted. First, HOOD was increasing, and he thought its growth would decelerate, but now he is looking for an acceleration. Second, the macroeconomic backdrop is more favorable, as he expected several years of improved retail engagement versus 2021 when he expected a significant decline. Third, HOOD is now profitable after cutting expenses much quicker than anyone expected, and these valuation metrics provide tangible support to the HOOD stock. In 2021, the HOOD stock was trading at 20x—50x revenues, and this valuation declined significantly to under 5x, which is why he noted that the entry point is more attractive. HOOD reported a record 40% adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, aiming for the 50% level over time as they reach economies of scale, Siegenthaler said. The analyst became more positive on HOOD’s ability to stay profitable going forward as they have now launched most of the standard products needed to compete with more developed peers and have reached the critical mass to withstand volatility in the market without having to rely on outsourced funding which has dried up considerably from when they went public in 2021.The analyst is positive on HOOD’s free cash flow conversation, which compares favorably to other brokers that either operate a capital-intensive bank or are using their balance sheet to fund growth via transition assistance.Price Action: HOOD shares traded higher by 10.1% at $19.69 at last check Friday.Also Read: Robinhood Launches Its First Crypto Staking Offering For Solana But Feature Limited To EuropePhoto via Shutterstock

Crypto Takes Center Stage in 2024 Election | Bankless


America is about to pick its next president, and this time, crypto is part of the conversation! It's shaping up to almost certainly be a race pitting Joe Biden versus Donald Trump (with long-shot contender Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. waiting in the wings).All of these men have had something to say about crypto over the years, but what they're saying right now matters an awful lot, considering the regulatory inquisition that crypto has endured over the past 18 months at the cavalier hands of the SEC and the watchful eye of a DOJ that has followed an unspoken mandate to prosecute and publicize all actions against crypto users, regardless of size or scope.The Democratic Party's loudest voices have turned crypto regulation into a political battleground. After years of branding themselves as the party poised to rein in Big Tech, a lack of progress there has pushed them to chase the budding crypto industry – a small, innovative corner of tech that has promised to challenge the centralized power of Big Tech. Elizabeth Warren’s Crypto Holy War on BanklessThe Senator’s ‘anti-crypto army’ is fighting against the resistance.In contrast, the Republican Party's efforts to generally favor lighter-handed regulation has put them in a favored position among crypto participants, incentivizing fresher lawmakers to build reputations as pro-crypto, pro-financial-freedom candidates, serving up bills that provide pathways and frameworks for the crypto industry to progress. Why talk about all of this now?We're at a key impasse this week. A bipartisan resolution which overturns a controversial SEC crypto accounting policy has just been voted through the Senate. But Joe Biden, who has been hesitant to insert himself into the crypto conversation has already signaled that he intends to veto the resolution, spotlighting himself as an adversary to the industry.All of this has been happening while Trump explicitly courts a crypto industry he has had mixed things to say about over the years, but now is ready to fully mobilize. At a Mar-a-Lago meetup for holders of his NFT collection (scheduled in between court days of his hush money trial in NYC) the former President wooed the industry.
All of these happening set up crypto regulation to increasingly be a battleground issue of this election that could draw more attention to the plights of the young industry and help either convert or entrench skeptical lawmakers eager to push the industry forward or tow their party line.In this article, let's dig deeper into this pressure cooker of political process and turmoil and see where the major parties have stood and currently stand 👇Senate Votes to Repeal SEC Crypto Rule on BanklessYour move, Joe.🔵 The BluesThe Democratic Party's broader stance can be summed up as generally hostile toward crypto, a stance reinforced by Biden's veto threat despite a number of Democratic Senators voting through the SEC rebuke resolution.
Top party members like Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-OH) have established reputations as critics concerned about consumer protection, financial crime, and environmental impact. Warren frequently warns of the risks posed by unregulated crypto markets and potential misuse for illicit activities. She’s emphasized:"Stablecoin legislation, which will grow the crypto market and provide opportunities for terrorist fundraising, must include the full suite of AML tools that the Treasury requested.” "Rogue nations, oligarchs, drug lords, and human traffickers are using digital assets to launder billions in stolen funds, evade sanctions, and finance terrorism."On the other hand, younger Democrats have recognized crypto as a tool for financial inclusion and innovation. These politicians believe that crypto can drive positive change with proper regulatory frameworks. Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) argues that crypto can provide financial access to those traditionally underserved by the banking system, co-sponsoring legislation to support this. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) considers crypto a force for financial democratization and economic empowerment, citing its potential for positive change and the need to keep the U.S. strong in the industry. Rep. Darren Soto (D-FL) supports clear regulatory frameworks, believing blockchains can enhance financial transparency and efficiency.These younger Democrats have sought to challenge the idea that their party is unilaterally anti-crypto, aiming to reframe the battleground as a generational one instead.🗣️ Joe BidenNevertheless, President Biden moving himself to the main stage of the fight threatens to further cement this fight as one political party versus the other.Initially, the Biden administration seemed to be adopting a balanced approach, aiming to foster innovation while ensuring consumer and financial stability through regulations. President Biden's executive order on cryptocurrency emphasizes the need for a coordinated federal policy to address the risks and benefits associated with digital assets.However, President Biden's threat to veto a House resolution rejecting the SEC's crypto accounting guidance (SAB 121) looks more in line with the stance of party members like Warren and Brown. SAB 121 proposes that banks meet different criteria for custodying crypto than for custodying traditional assets, which hinders adoption. While a measure to overturn it passed in the Senate, after passing last week in the House, the White House issued a statement last week saying they would veto it. 
This declaration reinforces the regulatory assault against the industry from the SEC, a predominantly Democratic body, to solidify the party’s majority stance as anti-crypto.🔴 The RedsThe Republic Party has, generally, more consistently supported the crypto industry, with the lion's share of pro-crypto bills being brought to the floor by Republican lawmakers and Trump's Administration generally being a much quieter time for the industry from a regulatory standpoint.VIDEOBeyond the former President, other prominent Republicans like Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Representative Tom Emmer (R-MN) have long advocated for clearer crypto regulation, introducing bills that create comprehensive frameworks for digital assets like stablecoins. Republican lawmakers like Lummis and Emmer tend to be wary of "over-regulation," arguing it drives innovation overseas and undermines America's competitive edge – something that has clearly been happening in the crypto space.Further, Republican lawmakers have tended to find more brand alignment than Democrats in the populism of Bitcoin as a check on Federal power.
For example, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has highlighted Bitcoin's potential for investment and financial independence while noting the benefits of Bitcoin mining for Texas's energy grid resilience. 🗣️ Donald TrumpTrump is setting himself as an industry savior, during a time when many crypto participants have grown frustrated with the regulatory approach of the Biden Administration.Trump was his most explicit yet in his recent speech at Mar-a-Lago. These statements occurred at an event explicitly designed for his NFT holders, from whom he has already profited millions. That financial incentive is potentially coloring his explicit stance, but many in crypto are just happy to have a mainstream candidate voicing the issues that matter to them.While Trump's comments at the event still lacked the specifics and the fervor some may have hoped for (he noted he was “fine with crypto” and emphasized the need for the U.S. to remain competitive in crypto globally and not be undercut by hostile regulation domestically), they served to drive a wedge between himself and President Biden, which was effective enough for many. As expected, Crypto Twitter broadly responded well to his messages. 
Where Does Conversation Move Next?As the election approaches, crypto is becoming increasingly front-and-center. The Democratic Party, led by figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown, continues to be the face of the regulatory war on crypto. This stance has also spread to include President Biden following the White House’s recent threat to veto the rejection of SAB 121 — a move aligning with the party's hawks and the predominantly blue SEC.In contrast, Republicans have continued supporting the industry's domestic growth. Party members like Senator Cynthia Lummis, Representative Tom Emmer, and Senator Ted Cruz have publicly championed clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks while warning against overregulation that could drive businesses overseas — a message further emphasized by Donald Trump during his recent NFT holders event.Overall, the ideological divide on government intervention and financial innovation that underpins both parties sets the stage for crypto regulation to play a mainstage role in the upcoming election!Regardless of your personal stance, note the contrast between crypto’s role in the last election (nearly non-existent) and its role now. The evolution of its place in the political conversation from both sides clearly indicates that crypto's influence is growing.Trump’s Crypto Embrace on BanklessWith Democrats increasingly adopting anti-crypto stances, will Trump rally the industry around him?

SHIB Lead Shytoshi Kusama Makes Bullish Shibarium Announcement, XRP Made Strong Comeback, 3 Trillion SHIB Sent to Robinhood Amid 12.2% Price Surge: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


Here are the top three news stories over the past day presented to you by U.Today.Shytoshi Kusama explodes SHIB army with bullish Shibarium announcementAs announced by the Shiba Inu official X handle on May 15, ShibaSwap decentralized exchange has finally gone live on the layer-2 solution Shibarium. In a short thread, the SHIB team shared the details of ShibaSwap's new capabilities, such as operating on both Ethereum and Shibarium blockchains and the creation of new liquidity pools on Shibarium. Following the announcement, Shiba Inu lead Shytoshi Kusama quoted the SHIB X account to praise the outstanding achievements of his team (and developer Kaal Dhairya in particular) that made bringing ShibaSwap to Shibarium possible. Concluding his X post, Kusama asked all SHIB enthusiasts to "stay tuned," as there is “so much more in store as we march forward.” Dhariya, in turn, commented on Shiba Inu lead's post, adding that the SHIB team will continue to push out updates and upgrades on a regular basis since Shiba Inu's journey is “not a race, it’s a marathon.” XRP made strong comebackIn a recent development, XRP made a significant recovery, returning to the previously invalidated descending triangle pattern. Although this technical formation often indicates bearish trends, the fact that XRP has returned to this pattern implies that XRP bulls may soon try to redefine the asset's present trajectory. For the first time in weeks, XRP's buying power saw an increase. This increase caused the price to move toward several important moving averages, such as the 50, 100 and 200 EMAs. These moving averages act as important levels of resistance, and a break through them can portend a change in direction toward a more bullish trend. But even with this recent uptick in bullish momentum, XRP is still downtrending. The price action is still struggling below the resistance line of the descending triangle, indicating ongoing bearish pressure. All of the moving averages are heading downward, suggesting that the majority of investors are more bearish than bullish. At the moment of writing, XRP is changing hands at $0.5254, up 1.59% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.3 trillion SHIB mysteriously sent to Robinhood amid 12.2% price surgeData provided by Whale Alert crypto tracker shows that yesterday, May 16, an astonishing amount of Shiba Inu tokens, 3,000,000,000,000 SHIB, valued at $75 million, was transferred to Robinhood by an anonymous whale. The transaction occurred as SHIB showed 12% growth in its value over the course of 24 hours; the meme crypto is said to surge on the news of ShibaSwap launching on Shibarium - the development the SHIB community has been eagerly waiting for. The aforementioned transaction has also underscored the increase of whale activity that was observed throughout this week. On May 15, Cumberland, a large crypto trading firm, moved 144 billion SHIB worth $3.3 million to Coinbase. Prior to that, 50.36 billion Shiba Inu were deposited to OKX. In total, this week, before the movement of the previously mentioned three trillion SHIB, awakened SHIB whales transacted around 1.5 trillion Shiba Inu in a single day. They mostly carried between 42.6 billion and 397 billion SHIB to leading cryptocurrency trading platforms Binance, Coinbase, Gate.io and others. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002501, up 2.83%.

Senate Shuts Down SEC Plans: Does It Spell Doom for Gensler? - DailyCoin


        
SAB 121 has introduced controversial regulations impacting banking institutions and cryptocurrency holdings.



The Senate’s rejection of SAB 121 has signaled potential challenges to Gensler’s regulatory agenda.



Uncertainty has loomed over Gensler’s future as SEC Chair amid growing bipartisan resistance.
The U.S. Senate just dealt a blow to a major policy from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a move that could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry. The controversial rule in question? Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121.What Is SAB 121?SAB 121 is a proposed rule by the SEC that mandates regulated banking institutions to include their customers’ cryptocurrency holdings on their balance sheets. This rule was introduced as part of the SEC’s efforts to bring more transparency and accountability to the burgeoning crypto industry.Why is SAB 121 Bad/Good for Crypto?SAB 121 has faced significant opposition from the banking and crypto sectors. Critics argue that requiring banks to include crypto holdings on their balance sheets would complicate custodial services and negatively impact financial statements due to cryptocurrencies’ inherent volatility. 
On the other hand, proponents believe it could enhance transparency and investor protection in the crypto market. However, the strong backlash highlights widespread concerns about the potential negative impacts on financial stability and operational complexity for banks.How Does Gary Gensler Tie Into This? Gary Gensler, the Chair of the SEC, has been a central figure pushing for more stringent regulations in the cryptocurrency industry. SAB 121 is a key part of his broader agenda to regulate crypto assets more rigorously. Gensler’s tenure has been marked by initiatives aimed at increasing oversight and regulatory clarity in the crypto space, which he argues are necessary to protect investors and ensure market integrity.
The Senate’s rejection of SAB 121 is a significant setback for Gensler’s regulatory agenda. It reflects a growing bipartisan resistance to what many perceive as his overreaching regulatory measures. Is His Future as SEC Chair Under Scrutiny?This ruling challenges Gensler’s authority and could undermine his efforts to implement similar policies. Despite the pushback, Gensler’s legacy as SEC Chair will likely be judged on his ability to navigate this resistance and adjust his strategies or double down on his regulatory approach.While the Senate’s decision is a clear rebuke of Gensler’s policies, it does not necessarily mean his removal is imminent. President Joe Biden’s administration has expressed strong support for Gensler’s efforts, indicating that a veto of the Senate’s resolution is possible. However, the bipartisan nature of the Senate’s opposition suggests that Gensler will face increasing challenges. If the resistance continues to grow and his regulatory initiatives consistently face setbacks, his position could become untenable in the long term. Gensler remains at the helm for now, but his future as SEC Chair is certainly under more scrutiny.On the Flipside
Including cryptocurrency holdings on banks’ balance sheets would enhance their credibility and provide a clearer picture of their overall assets.



Despite the Senate’s rejection of SAB 121, Gensler’s position as SEC Chair probably remains secure for now.
Why This MattersWhile the fate of the Senate’s resolution remains uncertain, the vote represents a significant step forward for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. With the industry and lawmakers increasingly seeking a balanced approach, the future for digital assets appears brighter.If you’re interested in the legal wrangles surrounding cryptocurrency, then this article about Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC might be of interest:Ripple Seeks to Seal Documents from SEC: This Is WhyIf you like this article, you might also be interested in this piece on Gary Gensler’s defense of the SEC’s actions against Robinhood:Gary Gensler Defends Robinhood Action: SEC Follows the Law

Dolce & Gabbana face class action lawsuit after NFT delivery kerfuffle

A disgruntled customer has filed a class action lawsuit against Italian fashion brand Dolce & Gabbana and digital assets platform UNXD after alleged delays in delivering non-fungible token (NFT) products caused the digital assets to lose 97% of their value. According to a report from Bloomberg, a customer identified as Luke Brown paid $6,000 for “DGFamily NFTs,” a Dolce & Gabbana product combining digital and physical assets as privileges and experiences within the brand’s greater ecosystem. Class actionThe NFTs were allegedly delivered over a week late, which caused their value to plummet by $5,800. A set of accompanying “outfits” for the NFTs, which were purportedly meant for display in the metaverse, were further delayed by 11 days after the initial delivery. Brown has filed a class action suit on behalf of all customers who purchased the NFTs alleging that Dolce & Gabbana and UNXD failed to deliver on promises made at the point of transaction. Per the report, the delivery delays ensued after Dolce & Gabbana failed to obtain approval for the accompanying assets from the UNXD NFT platform. It’s unclear at this time how many customers may have been affected by the alleged delays. An NFT industry concernThis case highlights the ongoing struggle for companies, brands, and marketers as the realm of physical goods, products, and assets makes the transition to hybridized digitization. A physical product, such as a fashionable clothing item, functions in a dynamically different market than that of a digital asset, often with little correlation to one another. Further complicating the matter, the Dolce & Gabbana NFTs were created on the Ethereum blockchain for the “D&G Metaverse.” The Ethereum blockchain powers the world’s second most popular cryptocurrency and, as Cointelegraph reported, Dolce & Gabbana NFTs have sold for millions of dollars in the past. These facts could have an impact on the class action lawsuit if it moves forward.Related: Iconic brands including Nike, Gucci have made $260M off NFT sales Cointelegraph reached out to Dolce & Gabbana for comment but did not receive an immediate response.

Bitcoin Is Booming, Hits Highest Price Since the Halving - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe price of Bitcoin has surged to its highest since the much-talked about halving event on April 19, touching a recent high of $67,422 on Friday before dipping again.CoinGecko data shows that the biggest digital asset is up by nearly 3% in the past day. Over seven days, the coin has risen by more than 9%. It's now priced at $66,750. Bitcoin last hit today's high price on April 13, more than a month ago.Bitcoin dropped following the halving—a quadrennial happening baked into the coin's code—though experts told Decrypt that was to be expected.A combination of factors including geopolitical turmoil, cooling hype surrounding the new spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investor uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's next moves caused the virtual asset to nosedive down to under $57,000 last month.It has been rising ever since, though Bitcoin's price is still below its all-time high price of $73,737 set this March.The Bitcoin halving took place late on April 19 in the United States. It led to miners, the power-hungry operations that process transactions on the network, having their rewards cut in half from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC for each block they process.Designed as a feature of Bitcoin to make it deflationary, the idea is that the event will make sure that as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to make new virtual coins. Four halvings have now taken place, and after about a year following each one, the coin has typically risen in price.Bitcoin's rise this year has mostly been thanks to new investors putting money into the asset via the new spot ETFs, which were approved in January. The investment vehicles have been massively popular, receiving billions of dollars in inflows.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Institutions Will Require Data Management Tools For Digital Asset Adoption

                        Institutional interest in digital assets is gaining traction. As of the end of Q1, more than 900 institutions based in the United States had disclosed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) shareholdings exceeding $100 million, equating to $10.7 billion combined.In addition, leading asset management firms, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have launched tokenized treasury funds. Recent data indicates that more than $1 billion in treasury notes has been tokenized on public blockchain networks.A bi-annual survey conducted by KPMG in Canada further found that institutional investors located in the region greatly increased their crypto holdings in 2023. According to KPMG’s survey, 22% more financial services organizations offered crypto asset products and services to clients last year than in previous years.Institutions Need Better Data Management Tools
While notable, digital asset data is still a challenge for institutions.Isabella Henderson, Director of Product Strategy at Amberdata, told Cryptonews that digital asset data is dense and complex.“Each crypto exchange uses different tickers and hundreds of thousands of asset instruments,” said Henderson. “This makes consistency and reliability a challenge for institutions.”Henderson pointed out that in traditional finance, standardized security masters and asset references solve these challenges by aligning front, middle, and back offices.Yet she noted that the digital asset space lacks such solutions, resulting in a fragmented view of the crypto sector for institutions.An Open-Source Master Security Database for Digital Assets
To solve this problem, Amerberdata recently launched an asset reference and classification tool. Known as “ARC,” this is an institutional-grade security master database for digital assets.A security master database is a data store that contains reference data about financial products. Such a tool is used by market participants to organize their records across trading, risk, clearing, and settlement operations.Henderson explained that ARC is an open-source dataset that enables financial institutions to segment and view the digital asset sector consistently.“By combining reference details, classification, and categorization, ARC is a solution that provides transparency into the operations and use cases of any digital asset,” she remarked.Unifying Crypto Data Sets
Henderson elaborated that ARC unifies front, middle, and back offices for institutions holding digital assets. This is done through data collected by Amberdata, which tracks traded crypto pairs across over 150,000 spot, options, and futures instruments.“ARC shows token addresses, contract and trade specifications, price limits, exploits, and more,” said Henderson. “ARC IDs also map an asset’s associated instruments across the digital asset ecosystem, using a tagging classification system to flexibly classify industries and proper use cases.”Henderson believes that such a tool can help institutions with analysis and reference, trading, and for other instances.“For example, ARC will help institutions keep records of the highly dynamic universe of digital assets with a repository of accurate asset and classification information for reference and analysis,” she said. “It can also optimize execution workflows to enhance trade execution strategies.”Data To Evaluate Digital Asset Risk 
Institutions also require data management tools to evaluate risks associated with digital assets.A recent Deloitte poll shows that executives involved in managing digital assets expect risks to increase and the regulatory environment to become more complex this year.Tim Davis, a Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory principal and U.S. Blockchain Leader, believes, “Digital asset risk should be a mainstay board agenda item for any organization that actively uses digital assets in its operations.”Given this, a Chainalysis spokesperson told Cryptonews that institutions could use Chainalysis on-chain data to evaluate risks associated with digital assets.“For example, we can help clients understand how widely distributed an asset is, how liquid it is, what segments of the crypto economy are holding and using it, and whether those segments skew toward being illicit or risky,” the spokesperson said.Will Institutions Implement Digital Asset Management Tools?
Since digital assets represent a fairly new sector for institutions, it is questionable if data management tools will be immediately implemented.Yet Henderson noted that Amberdata expects institutions to use ARC moving forward.“We have heard from many financial institutions and crypto native firms – both clients and not – that mapping assets across exchanges and markets is a major pain point across the trading life cycle,” she remarked.Henderson added that Amberdata has already initiated the process of ARC integration for a few institutions. She further pointed out that because ARC is open-sourced, it will advance within the digital asset industry through community contributions and insights.“There is a vast community of financial professionals and digital asset investors who will contribute to ARC, keep the dataset relevant and up to date, and eliminate proprietary biases on how to classify digital assets,” she said.Yet challenges may arise. Sebastian Higgs, Chief Operating Officer and Co-founder of Cordial Systems – an institutional-grade self-custody software provider – told Cryptonews that while transparency benefits public blockchains, there is an extreme side for institutions who want to build products on blockchain infrastructure.“They are still beholden to customer data privacy laws, confidentiality, and will want to retain certain processes or business logic as private instead of publishing them for the general public to see,” said Higgs.

                        In the latest Solana meme coin skyrocket, ETF token (ETF) has exploded +207% in just 24 hours amid a flurry of interest around crypto ETFs.This article will provide an analysis of ETF’s current price trends and look to see whether an innovative new meme coin, Dogeverse, represents a more promising investment opportunity in the Solana meme coin market at this time.ETF token launched to much market excitement a few days ago, with hype generated by a prelaunch marketing campaign for an ETF token airdrop – with these tokens now in circulation – price growth for ETF seems set for organic growth from here on out.ETF Price Analysis: As New Solana Meme Coin Surges Into Relevance, Could This Other Upcoming Launch Be Next?
With price action continuing to hammer up to the upside, ETF token is currently trading at a market price of $0.00134 (representing a 24-hour change of +202%).This comes after a breath of life surged into the chart at around 12:30 UTC on May 16, in an electric move that saw an incredible 8 consecutive green hourly candles.The initial upside surge stalled at resistance around $0.0013, triggering a momentary consolidation above lower support at $0.0008.However, a successful defense by bulls at this level set the stage for a resurgent second rally leg that has so far seen ETF price hammer up a further +48% to a present local high at $0.0014.But, while price action remains trading high, all eyes are now on ETF’s market cap, which has surged over $1M to hit $1.3M in the past few hours – creating an allure for a potential 5-10x leap in the coming hours.Beyond this, buy pressure is holding its dominance to a moderate degree at 53% of taker buys in the past hour.Yet, with price action overextended to some degree, analysts are now shifting their attention to an emerging launch from the recent DOGEVERSE presale.This presale unlocked viral success in the crypto community throughout April and now stands set for major tier-1 CEX listings.Next To Pump: Dogeverse – Over $15M Raised in Viral Meme Coin Presale
While Dogecoin price basks in the afterglow of fleeting Tesla support, the Dogeverse presale continues to gain traction. The latest presale statistics show that the project has raised over $15 million. Going by recent trends, this could just be the beginning of this upswing.Dogeverse offers better features than Dogecoin.Most importantly, it is the first multichain meme coin and will deploy on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, and Base, among other platforms.Moreover, Dogeverse, unlike Dogecoin, supports staking, meaning presale investors can diversify income streams from passive gains and decent DOGEVERSE yields.Buy DOGEVERSE Here

Anthony Scaramucci Predicts More Pension Funds Will Invest in Bitcoin, Says ‘We Are Still Early’ in BTC Adoption - The Daily Hodl


								SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci is predicting that more pension funds will add Bitcoin (BTC) to their investment portfolios.
In a new interview on CNBC Squawk Box, the hedge fund veteran says other pension funds are likely to follow the State of Wisconsin’s decision to invest in Bitcoin to help pay for retirement benefits.










New U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings showed this week that The State of Wisconsin Investment Board, a state agency managing investments for public retirement and trust funds, has about $163 million invested in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).
“I think the institutional adoption is happening now. The State of Wisconsin announced. We expect other pension funds to announce. And of course, Bitcoin now has the regulatory approval. And I think that was the rate limiting step for a lot of these large-scale institutions… 
A lot of smart institutions are saying, ‘Let me get long this thing.'” 
Scaramucci believes that Bitcoin remains in the early stages of adoption.
“Sometimes when you’re early, you get a lot of bumps and scrapes. But I think it pays to be early in Bitcoin and I think we’re still early in Bitcoin.”
Bitcoin is trading for $67,142 at time of writing, up 2.5% in the last 24 hours.

Developer Ignites Firestorm, Claims Ethereum Layer-2s Operate As Unregistered MSBs


								Ethereum is a legacy chain that has scaled over time to address the needs of the ever-demanding global user base. To relieve the mainnet of the deluge of transactions, more layer-2 platforms have sprouted. 
They are cheaper to transact on and scalable, allowing users to deploy intensive decentralized applications that won’t be feasible on the base layer.
Ethereum Layer-2s Are A Success, But There Is A Problem
According to L2Beat, layer-2 platforms on Ethereum currently manage over $39 billion in total value locked (TVL). Even so, Nikita Zhavoronkov, a lead developer at Blockchair, is concerned and thinks layer-2s are a “huge legal liability waiting to happen.”
Ethereum layer-2s TVL | Source: L2Beat
Taking to X, Zhavoronkov argues that layer-2 protocols on Ethereum and Bitcoin are vulnerable to regulator crackdown. In the developer’s assessment, these platforms resemble money service businesses (MSBs), considering how they are designed to operate. Since they are not regulated, the developer said they might be operating illegally.

Top of the list, Zhavoronkov argues that most existing layer-2 solutions are not truly decentralized. They point to using multi-signature contracts or “emergency councils” controlled by limited groups as evidence of centralized control. 
Moreover, the developer highlighted the custodial nature of many layer-2s. Users do not directly control user funds based on how these scalable platforms operate. The analyst says this tinge of centralization presents a vulnerability if regulators target these entities.
Zhavoronkov adds that though layer-2 platforms are enablers, working from a trustless base, they function as for-profit businesses, generating revenue from transaction fees. Because some of them, like Optimism and Arbitrum, issue tokens, revenue accrued can impact token prices. 
The developer contends that this is why layer-2 platforms are no different from traditional companies than truly decentralized platforms.
More Headwinds For ETH, United States SEC Reported Investigation
Given their mode of operation and model, Zhavoronkov’s assertion that layer-2 solutions could be classified as MSBs under United States laws is a concern. Such a classification could subject these protocols to stringent regulations, compliance requirements, and potential sanctions. 
This not only threatens to stifle innovation but also has the potential to hamper Ethereum’s scalability severely.

While some have dismissed Zhavoronkov’s viewpoint as “distorted,” the fact that Ethereum is reportedly under investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adds a layer of complexity to the situation. 

Analysts say the SEC’s classification of ETH as a security rather than a commodity like BTC could further delay the approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Solana meme coins surge up to 210% despite Pump.fun incident - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Meme coin marketplace Pump.fun was attacked by a former team member yesterday, resulting in halted trading, users unable to liquidate their tokens, and the platform losing $1.9 million, according to a May 16 post-mortem. Despite this episode, the meme coin sector on Solana stood firmly in the last 24 hours, with tokens making two-digit leaps.The best performance in the period was registered by DogeBoy (DOGB), with a nearly 210% upside, while Pepe Trump (PTRUMP) also saw significant positive movement of 67.5%. Maga VP (MVP), another Trump-themed token, is also among the biggest winners in the period, presenting almost a 31% price advance.On the cat-coins front, MANEKI has shown 34% growth in the past 24 hours at the time of writing, a movement that made its market cap surpass $91 million. UpSideDownCat (USDC) surged almost 54% in the same period, and the cat Chipi (CHIPI) showed a 72% upside.Solana meme coins with the best performances in the last 24 hours. Image: CoinGeckoThe Costco Hot Dog (COST), a meme coin that backpacked the meme of hot dogs sold at Costco markets never rising in value, has risen 38% at the time of writing. The meme coin FindMe shown in the image above was, in fact, a honey pot attack.Honey pots are smart contracts programmed to forbid tokens from being sold, while the contract deployer drains all the liquidity. Currently, the only FindMe pool available has $231 in liquidity, which highlights the risks of trading meme coins.Moreover, despite showing a 33% growth in the last 24 hours, the token Lola Cat (LOLA) is still relatively new to the meme coin market. Hence, the asset still doesn’t have a seven-day track record.Solordi (SOLO) represents the dog-themed coins on the meme coins with the most substantial growth in the last 24 hours after leaping 37.7%.Pump.fun explains the ‘exploit’As reported by Crypto Briefing, a user used flash loans to manipulate token prices on Pump.fun, borrowing SOL from the money market Drift. However, the exploiter was able to move liquidity from Pump.fun’s pools, which would be possible only by using an authorized wallet.Wintermute’s head of research Igor Igamberdiev identified that the wallet commonly used to move liquidity from Pump.fun to decentralized exchange Raydium was being controlled by the exploiter, suggesting a private key compromise or an inside job.In their post-mortem, the meme coin marketplace revealed that a former employee was responsible for the attack, and misappropriated nearly 12,300 SOL. Pump.fun tackled the issue by deploying their smart contracts again, launching pools with the whole they met in the bonding curve during the incident, and removing the platform fees for the next seven days.

Proton Mail exposing activist's info showed the limits of encryption

Proton AG — the Swiss company behind Proton Mail, the popular encrypted email service — came under fire in April for complying with a request from Spanish police for information about one of its users — a Catalan pro-independence activist. It’s obvious why that was a controversial move. It feels gross when the “good guys” get “sold out” by a company that promises privacy. But if you’re pissed off at Proton for complying with legal requests, you need to reassess your fantasies about privacy tech.We all love encryption and its attached ideals. But encryption isn’t a panacea, and the more we encrypt, the more metadata matters. When it comes to privacy, metadata is an exercise in minimization — but centralized services have natural limits on how mini they can make their metadata collection.Related: Big miners pose a growing existential threat to BitcoinProton has done an amazing job limiting access to user metadata. They should get a pat on the back for building a system where all they can provide is an optional recovery email. (In this case, the company provided their user's recovery email address, which led police to their Apple account.) Instead, they’ve been met with online anons brandishing “Cancel Subscription” buttons and ominous headlines that begin with “Is Proton…” and end with question marks.The Platonic ideal of privacy techThe fantasy goes like this: privacy company receives formal legal request from authorities, privacy company flips off authorities, privacy company delivers news of triumph to the frenzied cheers of their fans. This expectation has reared its head multiple times, including another ProtonMail case from just a couple of years ago. But the fantasy is delusional and self-destructive.If Proton took this route, they’d be met with crippling legal pressure which would set the sun on the entire company rather quickly — and then we’re down to just a couple of established encrypted email providers. That’s not a useful outcome for Proton, Proton users, or privacy at large. FreedomTech editor SethForPrivacy defended Proton Mail in a post on X, writing thatthe case had "proven" Proton's architecture "minimizes the amount of data they have on any user."Proton is well aware of this, so the reality is they complied with almost 6,000 legal requests in 2023 alone. Once the shock of the news wore off and steady hands like SethForPrivacy weighed in, more people accepted that outrage wasn’t really warranted nor was it helpful. Blaming opsec is a copoutAs the story cooled down, Proton defenders pointed out that deanonymization was only possible in this case because an opt-in recovery email was provided. They say it’s actually the activist’s fault for having leaky operational security (opsec) — but this is just another unproductive iteration of the blame game.We can’t just end this story with, ‘Oh well, you just have to have better opsec than that.’The core question is: Can we do better?Encryption is our baseline. We should use it, we should advocate for it, we should protect it. Proton has this and minimal metadata collection, so we’ve got a good foundation to work with here.On top of this, the sage advice is to access Proton with a VPN/Tor (importantly, not ProtonVPN) and pay for your subscription using crypto. This message spread far and wide over the last couple of weeks — but it’s not new advice, and we’re still seeing cases like our Catalan activist pop up. People will get left behind if services require manual user hardening, and sometimes they’ll be the same at-risk people we’re trying to protect.In the Catalan case, an email provided to sign up for an E2EE messaging app, a recovery email provided to a secure email service, and an iCloud email were the puzzle pieces required for deanonymization. These are small mistakes that anyone could make, but together they create a metadata breadcrumb trail that can be followed with relative ease.Potential for decentralization in limiting metadata collectionOur goal should be to create tooling which is hardened out of the box, and to make damn sure any options that might jeopardize privacy are clearly described in-situ.Perhaps decentralizing parts of the system could help us take things a step further than Proton. Decentralization is a meaningful way to reduce the amount of data that a centralized company actually needs to process in order to offer a service.For example, building applications on top of decentralized networks capable of storing or routing the data required for a service. For an email service, that would mean storing and forwarding the mail itself — including vulnerable metadata such as subject lines and mail timestamps. That decentralized network layer would employ more advanced privacy-preserving techniques like onion routing, too. This way, a user’s IP would be better protected even if they’re not using a VPN. There are already some networks like this — such as Tor — but we’ve got similar networks that are secured and incentivised by blockchain, like the Nym mixnet. Related: Welcome to the United Kingdom — Please hand over your cryptoNetworks like Nym are generalisable for data-routing needs, and they already provide software development kits (SDKs) for integrating into third-party applications. Mixnets are pretty slow, so this might not be a good solution for instant messenger or conferencing services, but for email — it might work. The storage side of things is more complicated, app-specific networks, like the Session Network (used by the messaging app I work on), offer ephemeral message storage in a decentralized way, but this won’t suit email — which is a de facto record-keeping utility for a lot of people.This limitation combined with spam filters and the email mafia might make a top-to-bottom decentralized email service impractical — although it won’t stop people from trying — but we can absolutely make this work for other communication tools, like messaging, video and voice conferencing, and team communication platforms (like Slack and Discord). In the end, legal requests are going to keep on coming — and companies are going to keep complying. It’s the way it has to be. But in cases where safety and security is critical, purposeful decentralization could offer an extra layer of protection that is vital for at-risk people.Proton — people have already designed and built solutions that could be useful for you and your users. We can help, all you have to do is call (or, I suppose, send an email). Alexander Linton is a director of the encrypted messaging app Session and its nonprofit foundation OPTF.

U.S. banking giants experiment tokenization with this cryptocurrency


The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), recognized as the world’s largest settlement system, has teamed up with blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK) to conclude a pilot program with several major U.S. banking firms.
The primary goal of this initiative was to advance the tokenization of traditional finance funds.
Following the announcement of DTCC’s successful completion of the tokenization pilot, Chainlink’s token saw a notable surge of up to 20%. 


This pilot, which included prominent Wall Street firms such as JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM) and BNY Mellon, leveraged Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to merge traditional finance with blockchain technology.
According to a report from DTCC, the firm recently completed the pilot program, dubbed Smart NAV, in conjunction with Chainlink. The program was designed to explore an extension of a DTCC service, Mutual Fund Profile Service I (MFPS I), the industry standard for transmitting ‘Price and Rate’ data, also referred to as ‘NAV data’.

The pilot showed that by delivering structured data on-chain and creating standard roles and processes, foundational data could be utilized in various on-chain use cases. These included tokenized funds and bulk consumer smart contracts, which hold data for multiple funds.
Prominent participants included American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust, State Street, and U.S. Bank
Market response and price movements

Following the release of DTCC’s report, Chainlink’s native token, LINK, experienced a 12.5% increase in value. At press time, LINK surged past $16, with its market cap increasing by 14% in the past 8 hours, triggering the liquidation of $1.96 million in short positions over the last 24 hours. 
This spike in LINK’s price demonstrates the market’s positive reaction to the potential of integrating traditional finance with blockchain technology.

This pilot program is part of a broader trend where major traditional financial institutions are showing a growing interest in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.
As reported by Finbold, tokenized real-world assets have soared to nearly $8 billion in value as demand surged. 
For instance, on March 19, BlackRock  (NYSE: BLK)  introduced a tokenized money market fund called BUIDL on the Ethereum (ETH) network. This fund allows investors to acquire tokens representing shares in the fund, which primarily invests in U.S. Treasury bills.
The future of tokenized funds
Wall Street firms have long shown interest in blockchain technology but have often hesitated to operate on public blockchains.
In 2023, several notable firms, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), joined the Canton Network—a private pilot network aimed at allowing large institutions to explore decentralized infrastructure. 
The new test with Chainlink is different because its goal is to obtain Wall Street data directly from the institutions and make it available for use by smart contracts and other Real World Asset protocols on public networks. 
This marks a significant step towards integrating blockchain technology with mainstream finance, highlighting the potential for real-time, more automated data dissemination and built-in access to historical data.

South Korean Government Publishes Cryptocurrency Report: "There is a Crazy Trend Among Koreans" - Bitcoin Sistemi


South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) has published a survey that reveals a significant increase in the number of cryptocurrency users in the country. The survey shows that the number of cryptocurrency users has reached 6.45 million, accounting for 12.9% of South Korea's total population. It is noteworthy that 4.55 million of these users are small investors with cryptocurrencies worth less than $ 734.
The Korean Financial Intelligence Unit, under Gwang Park, conducted a survey of 29 reported businesses in the second half of 2023. The aim was to understand the current state of the local virtual asset market.


As the market price of virtual assets rose, there was a noticeable increase in average daily transaction size (24%), market capitalization (53%) and deposits won (21%) compared to the first half of 2023 in South Korea. Additionally, the number of users making transactions increased by 6%.

The survey also highlighted that the number of new altcoin listings in the Korean won market increased significantly by 70%. However, with a significant increase in the number of transaction suspensions in the coin market (42%), the total number of coins decreased slightly by 3.5%.





The survey warned that despite growth, volatility in virtual asset prices remained high at 62% and called on investors to make careful investment decisions. Additionally, the number of virtual asset operators announcing the closure of their businesses continues to rise to four, urging users to be extra careful.

Will the USDC outperform USDT in 2024?


The stablecoin Circle USD (USDC) has been growing in market share and approaching the undisputed leader, Tether USD (USDT). Ongoing regulatory developments threaten Tether’s presence in key markets, which could affect the company’s flagship product.
Notably, Circle launched the USDC in September 2018 in a stablecoin market highly dominated by USDT. Over the years, traders and investors welcomed the competition, considering growing concerns about Tether’s reserves and redeemability. 
In over five years, the USDC has increased its market cap to $33.34 billion, becoming the sixth-most valuable cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the USDT grew even more to $111.22 billion and kept third place among the most valuable cryptocurrencies.


Tether’s stablecoin also dominates the trading volume on centralized exchanges, although Circle has a larger presence in DeFi.

Kraken considers delisting USDT in Europe
However, Circle has a strong political presence in the United States, which the company has used in its favor against the competitor, as reported by Finbold in February 2024. Further regulatory developments outside the U.S. threaten USDT’s hegemony, opening space for USDC to take over.
In particular, Kraken is considering removing support from the USDT in Europe, according to a Bloomberg report on May 17. The possible delisting of Tether products surges amid concerns related to the European Union (EU) MiCa rules that regulate cryptocurrencies.
Kraken is one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges and the second-largest provider in the United States. The company represents a key market previously mostly dominated by Tether, and others could follow its lead.
According to crypto journalist Colin Wu, the OKX exchange recently announced the delisting of most USDT pairs. Therefore highlighting a possible trend favoring USDC over its stablecoin competitor.

Interestingly, the finance giant BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK) has previously disclosed “exposure to stablecoin risks” on its spot Bitcoin ETF filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At that time, BlackRock mentioned concerns over Tether’s reserves and Circle’s abilities to keep the $1-peg.  
Now, the market awaits to see what will happen in the battle among the leading stablecoins. Losing key markets like Kraken and OKX could be a significant hit to USDT and a massive win to USDC, as capital is expected to migrate from the first to the second. As reported by Bloomberg, the new digital asset’s regime is set to take effect in July.

US arrests two Chinese nationals in $73 million crypto scam - CoinJournal



                    

                    
US authorities arrested Daren Li and Yicheng Zhang in connection with a $73 million money laundering scheme.
The defendants laundered the money via US and international bank accounts.
Proceeds of the investment scam were converted to the USDT stablecoin.

The US Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals alleged to have played a prominent role in a scheme that laundered $73 million in cryptocurrency investment schemes.
According to an indictment unsealed on Thursday in the Central District of California, authorities arrested Daren Li, 41, on April 12 and Yicheng Zhang, 38, on May 16.
Li is a dual citizen of China and St. Kitts and Nevis, while Zhang is a Temple City, California.
Defendants ran an international crypto investment scam
Li, Zhang and others are alleged to have been behind an international money laundering syndicate that scammed victims via pig butchering, among the common crypto scams.  
In Court documents show that the suspects laundered proceeds of these crypto scams via bank accounts of multiple shell companies.
DOJ’s Office of Public Affairs announced that more than $73 million was defrauded from victims and laundered through US and international bank accounts. The laundered money found its way to The Bahamas and was converted to Tether (USDT).
“Cryptocurrency investment scams exploit the borderless nature of virtual currency and online communications to defraud victims,” Lisa Monaco, the United States Deputy Attorney General, said in the press release.
“While fraud in the crypto markets takes on many forms and hides in many far-off places, its perpetrators aren’t beyond the law’s reach. Today, we announce the arrests of two foreign nationals charged for leading a scheme to launder funds to the tune of at least $73 million tied to an international crypto investment scam,” she added.
According to the court documents, a crypto wallet linked to the scam received more than $341 million in cryptocurrencies.
The DOJ has charged Li and Zhang with conspiracy to commit money laundering as well as six counts of international money laundering. Each of the counts carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.
In November last year, the DOJ said it had seized $9 million in USDT linked to an international romance and pig butchering scheme.

Coinbase Sees Upside for Ether Despite Recent Bitcoin Outflow


							

Coinbase: Ether underperforms Bitcoin in 2024 so far



Report sees positive long-term outlook for Ether despite underperformance



Coinbase: U.S. Ether ETF approval could be underestimated by market




In a recent report, Coinbase acknowledged that Ether (ETH) has underperformed compared to Bitcoin (BTC) in the cryptocurrency market so far this year. Despite this, the report emphasizes a positive long-term outlook for Ether.




Ether may have the potential to surprise to the upside in the coming months,” Coinbase’s repost stated, stressing that digital assets don’t “major sources of supply-side overhangs” such as token unlocks or pressure created by miners’ sales.




Coinbase’s data shows that Ether has risen in price by 29% over the past year, trailing Bitcoin’s 50% year-to-date gain. Analyst David Han attributes Ether’s potential future growth to its lack of significant supply-side pressures. He emphasizes the increasing role of staking and layer-2 solutions in absorbing ETH liquidity. He further explained:




ETH’s position as the center of decentralized finance (DeFi) is also unlikely to be displaced in our view due to the widespread adoption of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its layer 2 innovations,” 




Coinbase also points to the potential impact of a U.S. Ether ETF, suggesting the market might be underestimating the timing and likelihood of its approval. The report acknowledges the initial deadline of May 23, 2024, but expresses optimism about potential litigation reversing a rejection.



Overall, Coinbase maintains a positive outlook for Ether, citing ongoing structural demand drivers and technological advancements within the Ethereum ecosystem. These factors, the report argues, will allow Ether to navigate various market conditions and maintain a stable trajectory.









In a separate development, data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that Coinbase experienced its third-largest Bitcoin outflow of 2024 on May 15th. The outflow, totaling nearly $1 billion, originated from Coinbase cold storage and involved two transactions, each comprising 8,000 Bitcoins.



However, the recent large Bitcoin outflow from Coinbase raises questions about investor sentiment and potential short-term market volatility. The interplay between these contrasting narratives – positive long-term outlook for Ether versus immediate market uncertainty – will likely shape the cryptocurrency’s performance in the coming months.

Is It Time To Buy Ethereum Ahead Of The ETF Decision? 'It Might Be Time To Pull Another Crazy Rally,' Trader Speculates - Benzinga

With a decision on the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs looking on May 23, the cryptocurrency community is discussing whether Ethereum ETH/USD is ready to rebound.What Happened: Cold Blooded Shiller kicked off the discussion by referencing a thread he wrote back in November when Ethereum was at a psychological low. He believes the situation now is similar, if not worse, and has decided to go long on ETH again."ETH maxi’s are in shambles," he notes, pointing out the euphoria among Solana enthusiasts and the peak of memes. Despite the undeniable poor performance, he asserts, "It’s time."Jelle provides a more technical outlook, mentioning a forming falling wedge pattern for Ethereum. He believes that if Bitcoin can set a positive path, Ethereum might follow with a significant rally. "Still has some work to do, but if Bitcoin can show the way, it might be time for ETH to pull another crazy rally," Jelle comments.While Jelle notes that Ethereum is building one of its own falling wedges, another trader, Eugene, brings a strategic perspective, focusing on positioning in the ETH/Bitcoin BTC/USD pair.He observes the recent apathy and capitulation as ETHBTC hit a 3-year range low. Despite expecting a possible ETH ETF rejection, Eugene is optimistic about a rebound, predicting, "ETHBTC finds its bottom within the 0.043 – 0.045 region during the next 1-2 weeks."He concludes with cautious optimism, "Only time will tell if I become just another one of those slain ETH bulls."On the contrary, Altcoin Sherpa offers a different angle, noting that the charts don’t provide much reason to buy ETH, citing resistance levels and negative sentiment among holders. However, he also hints that the prevailing bitterness might be a contrarian buy signal. "Sentiment is horrid," he states, adding, "Which means it’s prob time to buy?"Also Read: Ethereum Spot ETF Approval Odds Decrease For Later This Month As Analyst Points Out SEC ‘Considering the Security Question for the Asset’Why It Matters: The potential approval of an Ethereum ETF has been a topic of discussion among market participants. Coinbase’s research suggests a higher probability of approval than the market prices in, which could significantly impact the price of Ethereum.Furthermore, ARK Invest and 21Shares have also shown interest in Ethereum ETFs. They have amended their filing for a spot Ethereum ETF application, which is currently under review by the SEC. The approval of an Ethereum ETF could unlock new capital inflows and provide regulatory clarity, bolstering Ethereum’s position in the market.What’s Next: The influence of Ethereum as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: ARK 21Shares Amends Spot ETH ETF Filing: Cathie Wood On Ethereum ETF ApprovalsThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Good News from the US to Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies This Time - Bitcoin Sistemi


The US state of Oklahoma took an important step this week, passing a bill guaranteeing the state's residents the right to keep their digital assets to themselves.
The bill, known as OKHB3594, was signed by Governor Kevin Stitt and will go into effect on November 1, 2024.


The legislation was sponsored by four Republicans, State Senators Bill Coleman and Dana Prieto, and State Representatives Brian Hill and Cody Maynard. The law aims to protect Oklahomans' 'fundamental bitcoin rights' by banning self-custody wallets or restrictions on hardware wallets.
The bill also addresses the issue of Bitcoin mining by banning discriminatory electricity rates for digital asset mining businesses. Oklahomans are now allowed to mine cryptocurrency both at home and industrially, provided they comply with local noise ordinances. “Persons who engage in home-based digital asset mining or digital asset mining business, staking or staking as a service, or engage in commercial staking will not be required to obtain a money transmitter license,” the bill states. The statement is included.






Additionally, the legislation allows residents to use cryptocurrency to pay for goods and services without paying additional taxes. “Digital assets used as a payment method may not be subject to any additional taxes, withholdings, assessments, or fees imposed by a state or local government based solely on the use of the digital asset as a payment method,” the bill states.
The bill was described as “groundbreaking” by Satoshi Act Fund CEO Dennis Porter. Porter believes the legislation is designed to protect the fundamental rights of Bitcoin users.

Cryptocurrencies rally, stocks trade sideways as traders speculate interest rate decision - Blockworks


Bitcoin and ether extended their rallies Friday, a sign pointing to sustained higher prices ahead, according to some analysts. 
Bitcoin (BTC) was up around 2% over the past 24 hours at time of publication to trade around $67,000, according to data from Coinbase. The largest cryptocurrency is now up more than 10% over the past seven days to hit the highest price since late April. Researchers from Matrixport attribute the run to favorable macroeconomic conditions. 
US inflation eased slightly in April, according to the latest consumer price index report released Wednesday, which showed prices were up 0.3% last month, slightly below expectations of a 0.4% increase.

“The trigger for the post-CPI pump this week was a marginally lower-than-expected inflation number that catapulted [b]itcoin +7% higher,” Matrixport analysts wrote in a note Friday. “However, the buying occurred relatively [gradually], indicating a persistent buyer in the market instead of a fast re-pricing, as we usually see when economic data causes a huge surprise.” 
Ether (ETH) also posted a rally this week, gaining close to 7%, per Coinbase. The cryptocurrency is now trading back above the $3,000 level after hovering around $2,900 last week. 
US equities on Friday were relatively flat after a week of returns. The S&P 500 is up 1.2% over the past five trading days while the Nasdaq Composite has gained 1.8%. 
Wednesday’s inflation print was enough to assure markets that the Federal Reserve will refrain from raising interest rates in June. Traders still widely anticipate that central bankers will opt to hold rates steady, according to Fed fund futures data from CME Group. Now that an increase is off the table, markets can breathe a sigh of relief, Matrixport analysts said. 
Even after three Fed officials — Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, New York Fed President John Williams and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin — on Thursday in separate speeches insisted that rate cuts are a long way off, traders were undeterred. 
“Interestingly, the total number of expected cuts has not moved — CME futures are still pricing in two before December,” Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, said. “Rather, it’s the timing that is in question, with a slight increase in hopes the first comes in July and 70% odds it comes in or before September.”

How Lorenzo Protocol is Supercharging Bitcoin DeFi With Liquid Restaking - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin is the original cryptocurrency—and dominates the market as the largest crypto by market capitalization.But as a trailblazer, it also suffers from limitations that have been addressed by the cryptocurrencies that followed in its wake. Those limitations—Bitcoin’s slow consensus mechanism, limited data storage capacity and lack of smart contract compatibility—mean that much of Bitcoin’s liquidity is cut off from the flourishing decentralized finance (DeFi) space.That’s what Lorenzo Protocol is aiming to address with its novel Bitcoin liquid restaking protocol.Liquid restaking builds on the existing model of liquid staking, which enables investors to participate in staking on proof-of-stake blockchains, while still retaining their personal liqudity.Lorenzo Protocol’s liquid restaking enables users to stake the stBTC derivative token that represents their staked asset across multiple blockchains, earning additional yield from their staked Bitcoin.“We are a platform to help stakeholders to lend BTC liquidity to the projects needing them for scale, and then to provide the yield from these projects,” Lorenzo Protocol founder Matt Ye told Decrypt. He added that, by tokenizing the lending and borrowing of BTC liquidity, it effectively creates BTC bonds.“First of all, we’re matching BTC holders with all the projects for BTC yield,” Ye said. “Two, we do the tokenization for staking.”“On top of that, we build StakingFi or YieldFi application layers on top of them,” he added. The platform uses the Lorenzo Appchain, an EVM-compatible Bitcoin Layer 2 network that’s secured by BabylonChain's Bitcoin shared security. “This L2 is in charge of the issuance and settlement of these staking tokens, and then also for building the DeFi ecosystem on top of these token standards,” Ye explained.The platform’s testnet will be launched “very soon,” Ye told Decrypt, enabling users to trial Lorenzo Protocol’s staking portal. “You can basically stake through us to Babylon, and at the same time we’re going to issue stBTC on our own L2s, and you can bridge them to the other L2 or L1 ecosystem with our bridge,” he explained.“Eastern BTC capital can meet western projects.”As the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem evolves, Ye predicted “huge demand for Bitcoin liquidity,” across purposes including L2s, BTC yield products, and staking portfolio management. “Every L2 is one BTC yield source; trading desks, trading strategies are others,” he said. “Given that BTC’s been expanding, demand in every single sector will grow.”“We tokenize everything every single staking opportunity, and we become like a marketplace,” he said, adding that Lorenzo Protocol aims to help to bridge the divide between BTC holders and staking opportunities across projects in the English-speaking world and Asia. At the moment, he said, there’s “no trust base, there are language barriers, it’s impossible for them to work together.” With Lorenzo Protocol in the middle, he said, “Eastern BTC capital can meet western projects.”Lorenzo also functions as a BTC bond trading protocol. “You could lend your money to anyone in the world, but without a bond market or money market your assets are very illiquid,” Ye said. A BTC bond market, he said, enables holders to “keep your liquidities and safety for financial stability for your asset investment.Its ecosystem could expand to encompass a wide range of products, Ye said, including yield swap products, lending protocols, structured Bitcoin yield products, insurance products, and BTC-backed overcollateralized stablecoins that use Lorenzo Protocol's stBTC derivative token as collateral.Ultimately, Lorenzo Protocol has sweeping ambitions, said Ye. “My hope is that eventually, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Brevan Howard, Two Sigma, Citadel, Fidelity—they could all be borrowing BTC capital on our platform,” he said, adding that, “We want to go very institutional. We're supposed to be the BTC bond exchange market in the world.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitcoin Adoption Slows Down To Multi-Year Lows, But Why?


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin adoption rate has slowed to the lowest since July 2018. Here’s what could be behind this trend.
Bitcoin New Addresses Count Has Plunged To Multi-Year Lows
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, an interesting trend has appeared in the Bitcoin New Addresses metric. The “New Addresses” indicator keeps track of the total number of new addresses created on the BTC network every day.
When this metric has a high value, it suggests many new addresses are currently popping up on the blockchain. Such a trend could indicate that new investors are entering the cryptocurrency.

However, this isn’t the only reason why the metric would register an increase, as old investors who had exited earlier could also contribute to the indicator’s value when they return. Holders making multiple wallets for privacy purposes would also naturally influence the metric.
In general, though, all of these are happening at once to some degree, so on the net, some adoption would occur for the asset. Thus, a high number of new addresses can be a bullish sign in the long term.
On the other hand, the indicator’s low value potentially suggests the cryptocurrency isn’t currently attracting fresh investors. Naturally, this would possibly imply a bearish outcome for the asset.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day average New Addresses metric for Bitcoin over the history of the asset:

The value of the metric appears to have been going down in recent months | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
As the above graph shows, the 7-day average of Bitcoin New Addresses has declined this year. This suggests that fewer and fewer new hands are potentially entering the asset.
Following the latest decrease, the metric’s value has dropped to just 276,000, the lowest since July 2018. The chart shows that a sharp cooldown in new addresses has generally coincided with the end of bullish periods.
Thus, going by this pattern, the latest rally may have run out of steam. There can, however, be alternative reasons for the recent trend rather than just a lack of interest among investors.
A big event for Bitcoin at the start of the year was the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that provide an alternate route of gaining exposure to the cryptocurrency in a format that’s more familiar to traditional investors.
It’s possible that the new users these days simply prefer to buy into spot ETFs instead. Since this adoption is happening off-chain, it makes sense why an on-chain metric wouldn’t be able to detect it.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $66,100, up more than 5% over the past week.

What Bitcoin ETFs and their record volumes tell us about HODLers - AMBCrypto



ETF volumes surged as BTC’s price appreciated on the charts
Number of long term holders declined though, despite recent hike in price

Bitcoin [BTC]’s recent push past the $65,000-level has inspired massive optimism among traders and investors alike. This, despite the minor correction that followed soon after. However, it isn’t just the crypto-market where BTC is making waves. In fact, Wall Street is pretty keen on Bitcoin as well.
Interest in ETFs grows
According to Santiment, seven major Bitcoin ETFs together recorded a trading volume of $5.65 billion, marking their highest volume since 24 March.
On 16 May, the net inflows of U.S Bitcoin spot ETFs amounted to $257 million, indicating significant investor activity. Notably, Grayscale’s ETF GBTC saw single-day net inflows of $4.6382 million. Similarly, BlackRock’s ETF IBIT recorded net inflows of $93.7004 million, while Fidelity’s ETF FBTC registered net inflows of $67.0829 million on the same day.

The interest showcased by institutional investors from the traditional finance world can help inject massive amounts of liquidity into the Bitcoin market.
However, large investors in the crypto-space, known as whales, did not show similar levels of interest in BTC. AMBCrypto’s examination of Santiment’s data revealed that addresses holding 10-10,000 BTC slowed down their accumulation. On the contrary, retail interest has been on the rise. Investors holding anywhere between 0.001 to 1 BTC were seen accumulating BTC at a high rate.
Accumulation of BTC by retail investors could be a positive for BTC in the long run as it will help make the overall network more decentralized.
Source: Santiment
How are holders doing?
At press time, BTC was trading at $66,314.84, with its price up by 0.47% in the last 24 hours. Due to the recent uptick in price, the MVRV ratio for BTC grew significantly over the last few days. This indicated that most holders were starting to get profitable. As the price of BTC hikes further, there is a high chance of profit taking that could take place in the future.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

Despite the surge in price, however, there was a concerning trend that emerged over the last few weeks. The Long/Short difference for BTC declined significantly, indicating that the number of long-term holders accumulating BTC fell and the number of short-term holders grew.
Short term holders are much more likely to respond impulsively to market fluctuations, having a negative impact on BTC’s price.

Bitcoin ETFs show $1.3 billion inflows and bounce back from April's slump - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US registered $1.3 billion in inflows over the past two weeks, shared Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on X. This was enough to recover completely from April’s net outflows of over $343 million.The Bitcoin ETFs traded in the US now hold more than $12.3 billion under management, which Balchunas considers a key number for considering inflows and outflows.Moreover, Balchunas highlighted that those numbers make a point of not getting “emotional” over Bitcoin ETF flows, sharing his belief that the net flows will turn out as positive in the long term and that the flow amounts are relatively small when compared to the total under management.As reported by Crypto Briefing, professional investment firms showed a high interest in Bitcoin ETFs in the first quarter, with 937 of them reporting exposure to those investment instruments in their 13F Forms.Balchunas doubled down on that, highlighting that BlackRock’s IBIT got 414 reported holders in Q1. He adds that having 20 holders for a recently launched ETF is “highly rare,” showing that at least four Bitcoin funds surpassed that mark with ease.Number of holders for ETFs launched in January. Image: Eric Balchunas/Bloomberg IntelligenceIn the last 24 hours, nine Bitcoin ETFs in the US added 3,743 BTC to their holdings, as reported by X user Lookonchain, which is equivalent to over $250 million. Grayscale’s GBTC added 397 BTC, while BlackRock’s IBIT added 1,435 BTC.Galaxy’s BTCO was the only Bitcoin ETF showing daily net outflows, with 543 BTC leaving their chest.Regulatory movementsFurthermore, recent regulatory developments in the US could heat up even more the Bitcoin ETF landscape. Yesterday, the Senate passed a vote to overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), which makes it more expensive for banks to hold digital assets for their customers.However, US President Joe Biden has already manifested himself contrary to the bill, and a presidential veto is very likely.

Crypto's Altcoin Gainers | Bankless


Building Strength. While broader crypto alts have struggled to catch a bid since mid-April, many are lighting up the charts with green today! Can this rally persist?GameStop’s announcement this morning to sell 45M shares (15% of GME’s current float) may have extinguished animal spirits for TradFi retail participants for the moment, but crypto degens appear to just be getting the party started…Base’s DEGEN memecoin was the top-performing token of note on the CoinGecko Top 300 gainers board, experiencing a healthy pump on a percentage basis and gaining 26% on the day.Although memes have been one of the top performing crypto asset classes throughout 2024, tokens with actual fundamentals were also in the mix for the top gainers spots today, with holders of the Solana DePIN token MOBILE bagging 21% returns and those of LINK, LDO, and PENDLE experiencing mid-teens gains.Zooming out beyond the daily price action, however, it is clear to see that these tokens were caught in a downturn when crypto markets rolled over in April and that persistent red days have come to take their toll alts; despite recent strength, many crypto assets are still underwater.Source: TradingViewUndeniably, all rallies must start somewhere, and while broader alts have largely bled throughout the past month, gains in BTC are seeding cause for optimism. Crypto’s largest asset is up nearly 20% in May and pressed against its highs from recent weeks, threatening a breakout to establish new all-time highs!With crypto funding rates for perpetual swaps are remaining cool and supportive for bulls in long positions, there is certainly a possibility that longer-tail crypto assets continue to run from here as degens become increasingly risk-on.TradFi stock indexes broke out to new all-time highs this week, meanwhile the rolling 90-day correlation between BTC and tech stocks has reached its highest level since August, suggesting that the prices of crypto and equities will continue to rise together if bullish sentiment holds.

Kraken considers ending USDT support in the EU - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Kraken is reportedly considering pulling support for the stablecoin USDT in Europe.
The exchange’s plans come amid the push for compliance ahead of EU’s crypto regulations MiCA.
Crypto exchange OKX ended its USDT trading support in the EU in March.

Kraken is considering a move that would see the crypto exchange end its support for the Tether (USDT) stablecoin in Europe.
A Bloomberg report published on Friday, May 17, noted that the crypto exchange was “actively reviewing” this position.
Kraken eying USDT delisting ahead of EU’s MiCA rules
According to the report, Kraken is looking at ending USDT support for the market ahead of the region’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation roll out date.
The delisting of USDT for the exchange’s EU users is part of the compliance procedure. 
Crypto exchanges and other providers with operations in the EU know that MiCA’s stablecoin rules are set to come into effect on June 30, 2024. The comprehensive regulatory framework also includes rules targeted at cryptocurrency service providers – these will take effect on December 30, 2024.
Kraken is “absolutely planning for all eventualities,” Marcus Hughes, the exchange’s global head of regulatory strategy, told Bloomberg. The crypto platform will take a firm position on this in due course, the official added.
If it takes this step, Kraken will join OKX which ended support for USDT trading pairs on its European platform in March.
Tether is currently the world’s largest USD-pegged stablecoin with over $110 billion in market cap, accounting for 68.7% of the $160 billion market. According to data from CoinGecko, USDT is currently available across 347 exchanges.

More Than 900 Professional Firms Bought Into Spot Bitcoin ETFs in Q1, According to Crypto Intelligence Firm - The Daily Hodl


								A senior analyst with crypto intelligence platform K33 Research says investments in spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are surging.
In a post on social media platform X, Vetle Lunde says that the number of professional firms that invested in Bitcoin ETFs in Q1 outpaced the number of firms that invested in gold ETFs in their first quarter.










“According to 13F reporting, 937 professional firms were invested in US spot ETFs as of March 31. In comparison, gold ETFs had 95 professional firms invested in their first quarter (Bitwise).”
13F filings are the quarterly reports that institutional investment managers with over $100 million in assets under management (AUM) submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Lunde notes that retail investors make up the lion’s share of those who hold spot Bitcoin ETFs, with $47.96 billion in investments, representing 81.3% of the assets under management in spot BTC ETFs.
“Retail owns a majority of the float. Professional investors held exposure of $11.06 billion by the end of Q1, representing 18.7% of the BTC ETF AUM.”
Lunde says the biggest ETFs, including ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL), have attracted the largest portion of institutional capital.
“ARKB and HODL have seen greater institutional dominance, helped by ARK and VanEck’s allocation to these ETFs.”
Financial giants have been buying up Bitcoin ETF shares: Morgan Stanley has purchased 4.27 million shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) worth $269.8 million, and JPMorgan is holding around $760,000 in spot BTC ETFs on behalf of its clients. Similarly, Wells Fargo disclosed that it was holding 2,245 shares of the GBTC worth $121,000 for its clients.
The state of Wisconsin also recently disclosed that it has large holdings in two Bitcoin trusts. New 13F filings show that the State of Wisconsin Investment Board has nearly $163 million worth of Bitcoin ETF holdings with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and GBTC.

OpenAI Exec Who Quit Says Safety 'Took a Backseat to Shiny Products' - Decrypt

Jan Leike, the former head of OpenAI’s alignment and "superalignment" initiatives, took to Twitter (aka X) on Friday to explain his reasoning for leaving the AI developer on Tuesday. In the tweet thread, Leike pointed to a lack of resources and safety focus as reasons for his decision to resign from the ChatGPT maker.OpenAI’s alignment or superalignment team is responsible for safety, and creating more human-centric AI models.Leike’s departure marks the third high-profile member of the OpenAI team to leave since February. On Tuesday, OpenAI co-founder and former Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever also announced that he was leaving the company.“Stepping away from this job has been one of the hardest things I have ever done,” Leike wrote. “Because we urgently need to figure out how to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us.”Leike noted that while he thought OpenAI would be the best place to do research into artificial intelligence, he didn’t always see eye-to-eye with the company’s leadership.“Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor,” Leike warned. “But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.”Noting the dangers of artificial general intelligence (AGI), Leike said OpenAI has an “enormous responsibility,” but said the company is more focused on achieving AGI and not on safety, noting that his team “has been sailing against the wind” and struggled for computing resources.Also known as the singularity, artificial general intelligence refers to an AI model able to solve problems in various areas like a human would, as well as having the ability to self-teach and solve problems the program was not trained for.On Monday, OpenAI revealed several new updates to its flagship generative AI product, ChatGPT, including the faster, more intelligent GPT-4O model. According to Leike, his former team at OpenAI is working on several projects related to more intelligent AI models.Before working for OpenAI, Leike worked as an alignment researcher at Google DeepMind.“It's been such a wild journey over the past ~3 years,” Leike wrote. “My team launched the first ever [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback] LLM with InstructGPT, published the first scalable oversight on LLMs, [and] pioneered automated interpretability and weak-to-strong generalization. More exciting stuff is coming out soon.”According to Leike, a serious conversation about the implications of achieving AGI is long overdue.“We must prioritize preparing for them as best we can,” Leike continued. “Only then can we ensure AGI benefits all of humanity.”While Leike did not mention any plans in the thread, he encouraged OpenAI to prepare for when AGI becomes a reality.“Learn to feel the AGI,” he said. “Act with the gravitas appropriate for what you're building. I believe you can ‘ship’ the cultural change that's needed.”“I am counting on you,” he concluded. “The world is counting on you.”Leike did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.Edited by Andrew HaywardGenerally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Huge Altcoin Project Everyone's Been Waiting For Finally Clarifies When Airdrop Will Be Distributed - Bitcoin Sistemi


ZkSync, a zero-knowledge (ZK) community, has hinted that the airdrop of the governance token will be held at the end of June. ZkSync, the Ethereum layer-2 network, has been the subject of speculation since March last year, when investors transferred over $8 million in tokens to the platform to qualify for the airdrop. The total value locked (TVL) has since risen to $141 million, as reported by DefiLlama.
The upcoming v24 is the last planned protocol upgrade before network management is handed over to the community. ZkSync stated that the remaining components are expected to be ready by the end of June.



ZkSync is a layer-2 network designed to scale Ethereum by storing computations and data off-chain. ZK falls into the rollup category, it is known as a subtype of layer-2 that takes advantage of zero-knowledge cryptography.
Following Ethereum's Dencun upgrade in March, transaction fees have decreased significantly. This upgrade enabled layer-2 networks like zkSync to compress transactions before sending them to the Ethereum mainnet, allowing for transaction fee savings.





Matter Labs, the developers behind zkSync, has raised a total of $458 million across various funding rounds.

League of Legends Patch Addresses Community Feedback | Cryptopolitan

Micro patch buffs Corki Smolder; nerfs Draven Samira.Players are building Ezreal, Gangplank, Yasuo, and Yone wrongly.Item rebalancing focused on improving builds over buffs.In the League of Legends patch, Riot listened to the community even during the first complications in balancing the game. Patch update rundownA second micro patch from Riot is due tomorrow, which will buff Corki and Smolder, who will be attracted to the new game, and Nerf Draven and Samira, who will be running away. Some boolean players have indicated that they keep requiring more boosts, but the former caster and current game designer David ‘Phreak’ Turley has said there is a lack of buffs in the probable status. Also Read: League of Legends PRO SuspendedPhreak states that Ezreal, Gangplank, Yasuo, and Yone are weaker because players build incorrectly. In this way, Yasuo and Yone were considered both winners and losers after the recent League of Legends patch 14 update. Finally, the items were frequently rebalanced. So, 10 critical strikes were increased. For Ezreal and Gangplank, nothing changed.Champion performance analysisOn the other hand, Faker recognizes Yasuo as one of the most powerful heroes in the current patch, with 48.5% to 50.19%. It should be noted that collected statistics based on the Smurf Patch 14 and Patch 18 show a 25% drop, and Yone’s statistics remain similar to the original statistics (48% to 49.8%). MF: Ezreal has continued to drop since 14.08 and tapered to 48%. Also Read: Most Played League of LegendAlthough this leads to some players calling for such buffs, and most of the champions seem to be completely fine, the issue that looms over Riot’s horizon is the lengthy process of perfecting items and creating the most suitable builds. Item and build adjustmentsThis might be a hard fact to handle for those expecting Riot to break this rule, yet it is agreeable for those who see Riot sticking to its script. Besides such changes, many people say that the atomic age is 14. they also have a 10-patch micro buff for Corki, who had his chance. This perhaps can be related to many changes as his win rate decreased. Furthermore, some changes were applied to the new Blackfire Torch and Fated Ashes. Of all these list items, the Fated Ashes was the most often used to cause trouble before the jungle.If you haven’t tried the new, well-known patch yet, don’t just watch a LoL tier list to find out which champions you should be locking in the next time you play.

How Canada’s 'Crypto King' Defrauded Investors of $30M - DailyCoin


        

Ontario police charge Aiden Pleterski with $41.5M fraud and money laundering.



Pleterski spent investor funds on luxury cars, private jets, and mansions.



At least one investor took justice into their own hands. 




Cryptocurrency investments have attracted both eager investors and opportunistic fraudsters. One such case has recently rocked Canada, as the self-proclaimed “Crypto King” was arrested for a $30 million scam. 



Ontario police recently charged Aiden Pleterski, who promised significant returns through his investment schemes, for money laundering and fraud. Instead of delivering to his investors, he used their money to fund his lavish lifestyle. 



‘Crypto King’ Charged



In May 2024, Ontario police, in collaboration with the provincial securities commission, charged Aiden Pleterski, known as Canada’s “Crypto King,” with fraud and money laundering. The charges followed a 16-month investigation named “Project Swan,” which revealed that Pleterski had defrauded investors of over C$41.5 million. 




According to the investigation, Pleterski raised approximately 41.5 million Canadian dollars (30 million US dollars), promising substantial returns through crypto investments. However, court documents revealed he only invested 1.6% of the funds. He used the rest of the money to finance a lavish lifestyle.



Pleterski’s extravagant spending included luxury cars, flights on private jets, and high-end properties. He rented multi-million dollar homes, such as a five-bedroom mansion in Burlington, and purchased high-end sports cars. Pleterski also showcased his opulent lifestyle on social media, which helped him maintain the illusion of a successful investment operation. However, this lavish lifestyle would soon backfire, as some of his victims took matters into their own hands. 



Disgruntled Investor Kidnaps ‘Crypto King’



In December 2022, as his fraud began to unravel, Pleterski was kidnapped in downtown Toronto. He was lured into a vehicle, where he was threatened with firearms and held captive for three days.




VIDEO




During his captivity, Pleterski was moved to various locations and repeatedly assaulted. The kidnappers filmed Pleterski apologizing to investors, demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom, and threatening his life and family. This video later surfaced during the investigation.




The investigation led to the arrest of five suspects involved in the kidnapping. According to the police, one of the kidnappers had lost $740,000 in investments to Pleterski. He and the other suspects face multiple charges, including kidnapping, forcible confinement, aggravated assault, and conspiracy.  



On the Flipside




Investment fraud is not confined to crypto. The most famous investment fraud case was that of Bernie Madoff, who managed to steal $64 billion from investors. 



A recent study uncovered the dangers of trusting the financial advice of crypto influencers. In the long term, their advice tends to lead to substantial losses. 




Why This Matters



The $30 million fraud case highlights how dangerous financial scams can be for both victims and perpetrators. Once faced with the loss of their life savings, victims can act dangerously, not shying away from illegal acts.

Solana (SOL) Price Targets $200 Leading the Crypto Rebound, Hedge Fund Founder Says

SOL hit $170 on Friday, its highest price in more than a month, before slightly retreating to $166 recently. It has advanced nearly 7% over the past 24 hours and is now up more than 40% from the crypto market's local bottom in early May, while BTC sank to $56,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) Trading in Tandem with Tech Stocks


Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, is trading in lockstep with technology stocks once again, according to a Friday report by Bloomberg. The 90-day correlation between the flagship cryptocurrency and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has reached 0.46, the highest level in almost a year. The increasing correlation undermines the portfolio diversification narrative that is frequently being pushed by Bitcoin proponents. Earlier this year, Bitcoin's correlation with stocks declined significantly. In fact, it turned negative in April, according to Fidelity's Jurrien Timmer. The correlation between the largest cryptocurrency and equities tends to fluctuate based on macro-financial conditions. For instance, it soared to as high as 0.50 in May 2022. It also surged through the roof in 2020 during the QE era.   Earlier this week, major US stock market averages managed to jump to record highs after the most recent CPI report showed declining inflation in the US.Bitcoin has also rebounded, reclaiming the much-coveted $67,000 level and reaching the highest price point since early April. The latest inflation data has revived bullish sentiment since Wall Street believes that the U.S. Federal Reserve might now end up cutting rates multiple times this year. Lower borrowing costs would be hugely beneficial for risk assets like stocks and crypto. However, the Fed has yet to break the back of inflation, which might suggest that this investor optimism could be premature.   Earlier today, U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman predicted that inflation would likely remain elevated "for some time." However, Bowman has stressed that she would be willing to hike rates if needed.

US Treasury strategy would tighten virtual asset regs, increase use of AI

The United States Treasury Department has released its biannual National Strategy for Combatting Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing. It contains four priority recommendations that may affect virtual assets in a variety of ways.The Treasury strategy acknowledged that law enforcement is scrambling to keep up with developing financial technology. The first two Treasury priorities are to address regulatory gaps in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and create a more focused and effective supervisory framework. The Treasury said it would “assess the need for additional action on sectors not subject to comprehensive AML/CFT measures.” Increasing enforcement is also on the agenda. The strategy said:“The explosion of new payment channels and financial service providers, including VASPs [virtual asset service providers], over the last decade, have stretched thin the limited supervisory resources historically applied to more traditional MSBs [money service businesses].”A new emphasis on blockchain technology is part of the strategy. For example, there is the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Virtual Assets Unit, which “provides technological equipment, blockchain analysis and virtual asset seizure training, and other sophisticated virtual asset training for FBI personnel.”Source: Under Secretary Brian NelsonFinally, the Treasury seeks to “support responsible technological innovation and harness technology to mitigate illicit finance risks” through a broad set of measures. It recommends increasing inclusivity in the financial system and combatting derisking — the practice of denying all correspondent services to small banks in areas of high illicit activity. Derisking has harsh consequences for legitimate users of bank services and encourages the use of crypto-based payment and remittance solutions that are not dependent on banking. Related: US Treasury official urges Congress for more power against crypto crimeCreating better cross-border payment systems and money transfer options under regulation are part of the strategy. It pointed to the G20 Roadmap and FedNow domestic transfer system as good implementations of this approach.Artificial intelligence and digital identity could play a big role in the strategy’s success:“We will provide regulatory and policy support for reliable digital identity solutions and […] expand the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics in U.S. government efforts to […] promote U.S. technological leadership on payments that reflect U.S. standards, practices, and values.” AI can be harnessed to enhance government regulatory and enforcement efforts, but it can equally well be applied by illicit users of the financial system, the strategy noted.

Price analysis 5/17: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, TON, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, SHIB

The bears' failure to sink and sustain Bitcoin (BTC) below the psychological level of $60,000 seems to have attracted buyers who are trying to propel the price toward the range resistance. The current upmove does not guarantee a breakout from the range but reduces the possibility of a sharp correction in the near term.Bitcoin’s recovery has boosted the daily volume in United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.

Lightspeed Newsletter: The Pump.fun exploit draws yawns and jeers - Blockworks


Howdy!
Happy Friday, folks. New York seems to be holding its collective breath today as the Knicks are about to play the Pacers for a trip to the conference finals. 
Solana seems less nervous today, since the memecoins are already back online after yesterday’s shenanigans.
Let’s get into it, shall we?
— Jack Kubinec

The Pump.fun exploit makes no sense 
Solana’s highest-grossing protocol by revenue was exploited for millions of dollars-worth yesterday, but no one seems particularly upset.
Pump.fun, the Solana memecoin app, lost nearly $2 million after a rogue employee with admin privileges used their access to the project’s withdrawal authority and a number of flash loans to buy up tokens. The employee then siphoned out the liquidity held in its bonding curve contracts, Pump.fun detailed in a postmortem Thursday evening. 
Usually, platforms being exploited creates pretty bad PR — both for the project, and in some cases, its underlying blockchain. 
That doesn’t seem to have been the case so far. Pump.fun redeployed its contracts and resumed trading the same day it was exploited, and DeFiLlama data shows the platform’s revenue was higher Thursday — the day of the exploit — than the day before. 
Pump.fun has been a big driver of Solana activity overall. The platform has been the highest-revenue protocol not named Ethereum over the past 30 days, hauling in $3 million more than DeFi heavyweight Uniswap Labs, according to DeFiLlama.
The app said on X that it was “working with some of the most esteemed security folks in the space,” but it didn’t say which esteemed security folks, and a representative for Pump.fun  declined to comment. The project’s code is still closed-source.
Solana investors also responded with a collective shrug to the exploit of Pump.fun. Solana traded mostly sideways throughout the day Thursday before climbing to a monthly high near $170 after Pump.fun released its postmortem, according to CoinGecko. Solana was trading at around $167 at press time, a level it hadn’t seen since April 12. 
Even the apparent exploiter, who took credit for the hack in a colorful series of X posts criticizing the Pump.fun team for mistreating them and custodying user funds, didn’t seem to garner much ill will from Solana’s community. They went on a series of X spaces Thursday afternoon where speakers broadly praised the exploiter’s actions. They’ve variously been compared to crypto’s Robin Hood or Edward Snowden. 
Sometimes markets aren’t all that rational, I guess, but also, as we have previously written regarding Pump.fun: “Sometimes, the grift is itself entertainment.”
If memecoins exist mainly for fun rather than for profit, then perhaps a memecoin platform being exploited isn’t so catastrophic — so long as the exploit was entertaining. And in this case, boy was it.

Another big week for Solana, with unique active programs increasing by 1,611 and total on-network instructions surging to nearly 4.6 billion. In other words, more developers are deploying and maintaining applications within the ecosystem, leading to higher computational demand. 
Concurrently, Solana surpassed Ethereum in daily transaction revenue on May 12, driven by a significant spike in fees. This surge provides further evidence of Solana’s ability to attract high-value transactions despite congestion. 
Although the increase in fees has raised concerns about potential deterrence in the past, we continue to see heightened demand for Solana-based services.

The Pulse
Island DAO kicks off today in Chania, Crete. But don’t be fooled by the name — it seems to be more of a coworking meetup than a decentralized autonomous organization. 
The event — aimed at apparently transforming a beachfront villa into a Solana coworking paradise — has sparked interest on social media as attendees arrive on the island. 
It might be good that the gathering seems to be mostly isolated to this one location, given that digital nomads are known to have a significant impact on the places they congregate. 
But for visitors who are true students of history, Crete will add a rich cultural backdrop to the gathering. The island is deeply connected to the ancient Minoan civilization, believed by some to have inspired Plato’s tales of Atlantis. In fact, locals claim the Atlantis story may recount a volcanic disaster that occurred on the nearby island of Thira, known today as Santorini (a theory that this editor wholeheartedly believes.)
This gathering is sure to be exciting for the Solana tribe, but it’s vital to tread lightly, preserving the island’s beauty and heritage. If DAO members are mindful of their impact, the island can remain a welcoming destination long into the future. Γεια μας!

Miners Eye Middle East as Next Region for Growth

“Compared to the U.S., the south of Oman has a few geopolitical advantages that are unique. It is very good for connections, as it’s next to submarine cables landing. It has, low [cost] electricity, reduced political risk, and favorable weather conditions for data centers,” said Olivier Ohnheiser, CEO of Green Data City, an Oman crypto-mining firm, told CoinDesk during Bitmain’s World Digital Mining Summit in Oman at the end of March.

MakerDAO Founder Unveils Two New Stablecoins - The Defiant

The new stablecoins are part of MakerDAO’s controversial Endgame plan and are intended to eventually replace DAI.Reconciling decentralization is the aim of MakerDAO’s endgame. At least according to the protocol’s founder, Rune Christensen.The latest phase of the Endgame was unveiled on May 15, when Christensen unveiled two new stablecoins: NewStable and PureDAI. Both tokens are meant to eventually replace DAI, which currently commands a $5.4 billion market cap, placing it in third overall for the sector.DAI Market Cap“From the moment Dai started scaling, it has been straddling two worlds,” wrote Christensen in a post titled Reconciling the two opposing paths for Decentralized Stablecoins. “One world is the culture of pure decentralization as introduced with Bitcoin. The other is the desire to fulfill the original purpose of DAI by delivering utility and value to real people at scale.”Christensen elaborated on the idea of the stablecoin trilemma, which claims that maintaining a stable peg while also being fully decentralized and scaling to large sizes, is not feasible.He promotes two options. The first prioritizes utility and scale by choosing a dollar peg backed by real-world assets (RWA) as collateral. The second, he wrote, demands complete independence from any sort of centralized control.With the unveiling of NewStable and PureDAI, achieving both is now possible, argues Christensen.What are NewStable and PureDAI?NewStable will be the main successor to DAI focused on growth, yield and resilience.However, its name will be revealed later this year once the new branding is complete. The token will take over the RWA aspect of MakerDAO (a sector that has been gaining significant traction over the past year) while remaining attached to Maker.It will introduce a novel freeze function “similar to the industry standard of other RWA-backed stablecoins,” although it will have to go through a governance process beforehand.Users wondering about DAI can sleep easy knowing that the token will continue to operate as is but can opt to be upgraded to NewStable.PureDAI and a Return to Ideological RootsAccording to Christensen, PureDAI is a return to the project’s ideological roots, one he says is supported by OG community members and cypherpunk idealists who continue to exist in the Ethereum space.In a lengthy May 17 post, he outlined how PureDAI will operate, although he let out a somewhat strange roadmap: the token won’t be ready to launch for years to come.Nevertheless, its main features include a free-floating target price, “only very decentralized” collateral through ETH and staked ETH (stETH), maximally decentralized oracles, minimal governance (no budgets or contributors), permanent location on Ethereum’s mainnet, and what he deems simple tokenomics that will promote stablecoin supply-side growth.Christensen also highlighted how PureDAI’s mechanics and tokenomics will work. An initial “genesis supply” of 2 billion PureDAI governance tokens — which calls into question its “minimal governance structure”— will be distributed in batches of 400 million over five years.Maker’s founder did explain, however, that there will be a burn mechanism for those governance tokens.What’s unique is that PureDAI offers the opportunity to experiment with tokenomics brought to life by Maker’s Endgame plan. The plan is to provide permanent emissions, which, according to Christensen, might support a greater level of PureDAI demand and growth without ever having to return to a negative rate.Christensen has called for the community to provide input about key features regarding other pure decentralized stablecoins, especially “observations about how their mechanics perform in the wild after launch.”

Crypto firms rally behind FIT21 bill approaching US House floor vote

Several cryptocurrency companies and advocacy groups urged United States lawmakers to support legislation clarifying the roles of the country’s financial regulators over digital assets.In a May 16 letter to the U.S. House of Representatives leadership, roughly 60 firms represented by the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) called on lawmakers to pass H.R.4763, or the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act. The bill, passed out of the House Financial Services Committee in July 2023, would clarify how the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulate digital assets.“We recognize that FIT 21 will introduce new compliance challenges for digital assets companies, but regulatory clarity is indisputably more responsible, safer for consumers, and preferable to the status quo,” said the CCI. “Currently, digital assets firms are instructed to somehow comply with U.S. securities laws that were designed nearly 100 years ago without consideration of the technological advances of today, including the ability for transactions to move at the speed of the internet.”Source: CCICoinbase, Circle, Block, Kraken, Gemini and Stand With Crypto were among the letter’s signees. The advocacy group urged U.S. voters to contact their representatives and support the bill.House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry said the FIT21 bill could be ready for a full floor vote “later this month” after consideration in the rules committee. This would give lawmakers roughly five days in session before June. Many lawmakers, including Representative French Hill, have already suggested they intend to vote in favor of the legislation.In the last ten days, the House and Senate passed a resolution to overturn an SEC rule on how banks are expected to handle digital assets. Though the legislation received bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress, U.S. President Joe Biden said he planned to veto it. Related: US stablecoin bill to ‘cement’ dollar dominance, fight sanction evasionAccording to digital asset advocate and Senator Cynthia Lummis, the resolution overturning the SEC rule was the first time this session of Congress passed “standalone crypto legislation.” It’s unclear whether lawmakers will follow suit in passing FIT21. The White House has not suggested whether President Biden will immediately sign the bill into law if passed by the House and Senate.The potential passage of the two crypto bills comes as the United States moves deeper into an election year. President Biden and former President Donald Trump, the presumptive candidates for the Democratic and Republican Parties in 2024, have agreed to two debates on June 27 and Sept. 10 in which crypto could be a topic of discussion.Magazine: Get Bitcoin or die tryin’: Why hip hop stars love crypto

Analytics Company Announces Solana (SOL) Price Prediction for the End of May - Bitcoin Sistemi


Solana (SOL) has been at the forefront of the recent cryptocurrency market recovery, outperforming most major digital assets and is predicted to hit new cycle highs soon, according to one analyst.
On Friday, SOL reached $170, its highest price in more than a month, before pulling back slightly to $166. It has gained nearly 7% in the past 24 hours and is up over 40% from the crypto market's local lows in early May, when Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to $56,000.


Daniel Choung, co-founder of digital asset hedge fund Syncracy Capital, praised SOL's resilience in a recent post. “The strength of SOL has been incredible in this bounce,” he said. “It's clear that this is still the best trade of this cycle.”

Choung expressed increased confidence that SOL could regain the $200 level by the end of the month and push new record levels soon. SOL reached an all-time high of $260 in November 2021 at the peak of the previous bull cycle.





Solana is currently benefiting from several catalysts, including active memecoin trading, strong stablecoin volumes, and decentralized finance (DeFi) activity. Choung noted that upcoming network upgrades lay the groundwork for the highly anticipated Firedancer, a secondary chain client developed by Jump Crypto that aims to improve the performance of the network.

Bank Executive Embezzles $1,528,321, Steals Customers' Personal Information To Deploy False and Fictitious Loans: DOJ - The Daily Hodl


								A former bank executive is facing decades behind bars for abusing her position to embezzle more than a million dollars.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri says Stacia Wilson has pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud.










Wilson, who worked as vice president at St. Clair County State Bank in Osceola, Missouri, has admitted to defrauding the bank and its customers in a scheme to enrich herself to the tune of $1.528 million.
The FBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation say Wilson exploited her authority as a loan processor to create false and fictitious loans using bank customers’ information without their knowledge and consent.
Prosecutors say that Wilson set up the loans using the bank’s computer systems before redirecting the funds for her own benefit.
Under the conditions of the plea agreement, Wilson is required to return the entirety of the funds that she stole to the government. She’s also facing a maximum of 30 years in prison without parole under federal statutes.
Wilson will be scheduled for sentencing after the United States Probation Office completes its pre-sentence investigation.
St. Clair County State Bank is a commercial bank with more than $200 million in assets.

It’s Almost Time For A Good Dogecoin Pump, Analyst Says | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo has laid out a bullish narrative for Dogecoin (DOGE). Based on his analysis, the foremost meme coin may make a parabolic run to the upside soon enough. The analyst also alluded to history to reaffirm that this rally will definitely happen. 
“It’s Almost Time” For A Good Dogecoin Pump
Crypto Kaleo remarked in an X (formerly Twitter) post that it is almost time for Dogecoin to rally significantly, as he stated that the foremost meme coin is “overdue for a good pump.” The crypto analyst made reference to a DOGE and GME chart while reminding his followers that it was GameStop “that led the way back in early 2021.” He claimed that it wasn’t until after GME topped that Dogecoin started pumping. 

Source: X
Indeed, the GameStop short squeeze is believed to have ushered in the meme season, leading to significant price surges for Dogecoin and other meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB). Besides Dogecoin’s correlation with GameStop, the analyst suggested that Dogecoin is also due to a pump because the “DOGE/BTC ratio still looks primed for a move higher.”
Source: X
As to when this Dogecoin rally is likely to happen, Kaleo mentioned that investors might have to “wait a few days, maybe a couple of weeks, for the Doge move to start” because he doesn’t think GME has topped yet. He also revealed that he is well positioned for this move as he has had “a bag for ages” and will continue accumulating the meme coin.
In the meantime, Kaleo remarked that a DOGE dip wouldn’t be surprising and might even be necessary for the imminent pump. He alluded to a Dogecoin pump in 2021 and noted that the meme coin retested a lower range before it eventually ripped that time, suggesting that a similar move could play out again this time around. Kaleo is also among crypto analysts who believe that Dogecoin could rise to as high as $1 in this bull run. 
A DOGE Breakout Is Near
Crypto analyst World of Charts recently noted that Dogecoin was on the verge of another breakout. According to him, a successful breakout will see the meme coin enjoy a 100% move as it rises to $0.3. Crypto analyst Jaydee also echoed a similar sentiment, highlighting DOGE’s monthly chart, which suggested that a breakout is imminent. Jaydee claimed that “Dogecoin will be life-changing for some very soon.”

Meanwhile, crypto analyst Crypto Scient predicted that a bullish reversal for DOGE could trigger a meme coin mania like the one in February. Going by Kaleo’s prediction, this meme coin mania could be similar to what happened in 2021, when meme coins enjoyed significant price surges after GameStop’s stock tops. 
At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.15, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

MakerDAO founder introduces new stablecoins: NewStable and PureDAI - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Rune Christensen, the founder of MakerDAO, has unveiled two new stablecoins, NewStable and PureDAI, as part of the protocol’s controversial Endgame plan.The new tokens are intended to eventually replace DAI, which currently commands a $5.4 billion market cap, placing it third overall in the stablecoin sector.Christensen’s goal is to reconcile the two opposing paths for decentralized stablecoins: one prioritizing utility and scale by choosing a dollar peg backed by real-world assets (RWA) as collateral, and the other demanding complete independence from any sort of centralized control.He argues that achieving both is now possible with the introduction of NewStable and PureDAI.
“From the moment Dai started scaling, it has been straddling two worlds,” Christensen said in a post to MakerDAO’s forums.
NewStable will be the main successor to DAI, focused on growth, yield, and resilience. It will take over the RWA aspect of MakerDAO while remaining attached to Maker, and introduce a novel freeze function similar to other RWA-backed stablecoins. Users can opt to upgrade their DAI to NewStable, although DAI will continue to operate as is.
“One world is the culture of pure decentralization as introduced with Bitcoin. The other is the desire to fulfill the original purpose of DAI by delivering utility and value to real people at scale,” Christensen explains, providing a distinction between the Endgame plan and the core values of the alpha crypto.
PureDAI, on the other hand, is positioned as a “return” to the project’s “ideological roots” supported by early community members and cypherpunk idealists. It will feature a free-floating target which “only very decentralized” participants can use as collateral through ETH and staked ETH (stETH). The new stablecoins will also allow users to leverage maximally decentralized oracles, minimal governance, and simple tokenomics that will promote stablecoin supply-side growth.Christensen claims that there will be an initial “genesis supply” of 2 billion PureDAI governance tokens which will be distributed in batches of 400 million over five years, with a burn mechanism set in place.

‘Change Your Life With Crypto’: With Bitcoin (BTC) on the Rise, Analyst Breaks Down Altcoin Markets - The Daily Hodl


								One widely followed crypto analyst believes digital assets are on the precipice of a prosperous new era.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 718,500 followers on the social media platform X that better times are ahead for the markets.










“This might be the final easy rally to change your life with crypto. 
If you have survived this correction and are still here, congratulations.
The coming period is going to be great.”
With Bitcoin (BTC) up 10% in the last week, Van de Poppe says that the $61,000 price zone has become the support for BTC’s next rally.
“Crucial level has flipped for Bitcoin at $60,500-$61,000.
It’s likely that the momentum will continue from here and the trend has switched.
As a response, altcoins are running up substantially as confidence comes back in.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
BTC is worth $67,276 at time of writing, up 2.5% on the day.
As the altcoin markets follow Bitcoin’s lead, the analyst points out one notable exception: the leading altcoin by market cap, Ethereum (ETH).
“Altcoins are waking up already, the only one lacking behind is ETH.
On edge of a reversal here, as the dominance chart is facing a higher timeframe resistance + multiple big events are coming up for Ethereum with the exchange-traded fund and the lawsuits.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
ETH is trading for $3,111 at time of writing, up 5.5% in the last 24 hours.

Santiment Announced: Sentiment For This Altcoin Reaches Levels Not Seen In 1 Year - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to analysis company Santiment, the price of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency in terms of market value, surprisingly rose above 67 thousand dollars today.
In addition to Bitcoin's rise, Chainlink, a decentralized oracle network that provides real-world data to smart contracts on the blockchain, has also been very bullish for over a year. According to Santiment, the FOMO index for LINK remains low, which could help these rallies continue.


According to Santiment data, sentiment for Chainlink has reached its highest level in the last year.

In related news, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world's largest securities settlement system, has successfully completed a pilot project with Chainlink and several major US financial institutions. The project, called “Smart NAV”, aimed to accelerate the tokenization of funds.





Market participants included American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust, State Street and US Bank.

Alarming USDT Hints from the Second Largest Cryptocurrency Exchange in the US - "We May Remove" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Kraken is actively evaluating plans that could lead to the removal of support for Tether (USDT), the world's most traded cryptocurrency, from its platform in the European Union.
This comes in line with a new regulatory legislation for digital assets that will be implemented in the EU in July.


Tether USDT, a stablecoin designed to maintain parity with the US dollar, is expected to be affected by upcoming EU regulations known as MiCA. These guidelines of the European Banking Authority, which have not yet been finalized, will impose restrictions on stablecoins offered to investors in member countries.
Marcus Hughes, Kraken's Head of Global Regulatory Strategy, said in a recent interview: “We are certainly planning for all possibilities, including situations where it may not be appropriate to list certain tokens like USDT. This is something we are actively looking at and will be firm on this as the situation becomes clearer.” We can make decisions.”





In response to Kraken's comments, Tether stated that while it expects USDT to remain an option for entering and exiting the market, it expects exchanges to focus on EUR liquidity for European customers.

OKX, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, modified trading support for USDT in the EU this year and removed the ability to use stablecoins to buy or sell other crypto assets. However, on the exchange, European users can continue to deposit or withdraw USDT assets, conduct over-the-counter transactions, and exchange them for Euros.


European regulators are nearing completion of technical guidance for MiCA, which is expected to be fully implemented by 2025.
“This is an evolving picture. What we are clear about is that it is not possible to present the scope of the type and number of stablecoins offered in Europe today going forward,” Hughes said. said.

Macro Continues to be a Key Driver for Crypto: Coinbase - Coinbase Glb (NASDAQ:COIN) - Benzinga

The macro environment continues to be a key driver for crypto performance, according to a Coinbase COIN report. Analysts David Han and David Duong cited the rebound in Bitcoin BTC/USD prices following the softer CPI print for April as evidence of a macro-led driver in the sector. "Macro continues to be a key driver for crypto performance.

Does the SAB 121 Vote Mean Anything for Future Crypto Legislation?

Unfortunately however, the legislative measure is now heading to the desk of President Joseph Biden, who has vowed to veto it in a show of solidarity with the SEC. Although a number of high profile Democrats, including New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, voted in favor of overturning the bulletin, the Senate’s 60 to 38 vote on Thursday failed to cross the threshold to override a presidential veto.

Chainlink & DTCC Unite to Modernize TradFi Infrastructure - DailyCoin


        

Chainlink teams up with major US banks to pilot improvements to TradFi investing infrastructure.



The program explored using blockchain technology to improve data dissemination. 



This provided a proof of concept on innovative use cases for the investment sector.




The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) offers critical TradFi infrastructure in clearing and settlement services for US investment firms. The entity processes trillions of daily transactions, underpinning the TradFi investment market. As blockchain technologies continue gaining traction, DTCC has recognized its potential for enhancing its core services and operational efficiencies.



One area the firm has been focused on is its Mutual Fund Profile Service I (MFPS I) system, which offers a standardized way for transmitting price and rate data, including net asset value (NAV) and dividend distribution data. Seeking to improve this process, DTCC recently launched the Smart NAV pilot, in conjunction with Chainlink, to explore enhanced data dissemination capabilities.



Tapping Chainlink Technology 



The Smart NAV pilot aimed to improve MFPS I’s data dissemination capabilities. Current processes for calculating and distributing NAV data are complex, manual, and riddled with inefficiencies. The need to bring MFPS I processes into the 21st century is all the more pressing considering the investment fund industry’s massive size and global assets under management’s expected reach of $145 trillion by 2025.




To tackle these challenges, the Smart NAV pilot brought together DTCC, Chainlink, and ten major financial institutions, including BNY Mellon, JPMorgan, and Invesco, to name a few. The goal was to utilize Chainlink’s blockchain technology to assess the feasibility of enhancing efficiencies and bringing more streamlined operations to the existing MFPS I platform.



How Smart NAV Worked



The Smart NAV pilot improved the existing MFPS I platform’s data dissemination by using a modern JSON data structure, wrapping it into a blockchain transaction secured by DTCC’s private cryptographic keys, and relaying it via Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability protocol (CCIP). 



The CCIP transmitted data loads across multiple blockchains, including DTCC’s private Ethereum blockchain. On this network, a smart contract system verified DTCC as the authorized and permissioned publisher before securely storing the on-chain NAV data in a decentralized manner. With the data made available on-chain, clients could consume and leverage the information.




Leveraging the information included using real-time APIs that pushed data updates to connected systems, smart contract models such as tokenized fund contracts directly inheriting the NAV data, and “bulk consumer” contracts representing baskets of multiple funds’ data. 



This enabled streamlined, automated dissemination of investment data while demonstrating powerful new ways to leverage the on-chain data for investment applications.



The Pilot’s Findings



The Smart NAV pilot demonstrated how delivering structured investment data on blockchain and establishing clear roles and processes governed by smart contracts enabled a wide variety of innovative use cases for investment applications.



By bringing pricing and distribution data on-chain in a standard, accessible format, Smart NAV opened the door for imaginative new applications and services leveraging the investment data flows. 



The pilot showcased the capability for real-time, fully automated dissemination of NAV and rate updates, a massive improvement over the sluggish manual processes of the existing system. It also provided built-in access to complete historical records, a previously unavailable capability.



The success of the Smart NAV pilot also laid the groundwork for DTCC and its partners to explore additional use cases, such as triggering automated workflow events and enabling asset managers to publish data directly to smart contracts without requiring a centralized hub.

Crypto Industry Relieved as Wallet Drainer Bites the Dust - DailyCoin


        

Notorious crypto wallet drainer Pink Drainer is shutting operations.



Pink Drainer caused a significant portion of the losses suffered by investors last year.



Wallet trainers are widely utilized by malicious actors, and several others still plague the industry.




Phishing scams are among the most weaponized forms of fraud in the crypto industry, often perpetrated by crypto wallet drainers who target unsuspecting victims. Last year, nearly 350,000 individuals fell victim to these schemes, collectively incurring losses totaling up to $295 million.



In a surprising turn of events, one of the most notorious drainers is stepping out of the ring.



Pink Drainer Bids Bye to Crypto: Is It True?



In a message flagged by on-chain sleuth ZachXBT on Friday, May 17, 2024, the group behind Pink Drainer, which stole funds to the tune of $85 million from thousands of crypto investors, announced the finalization of its operations, bidding farewell to the industry.




The message, posted on a Telegram channel, stated that the group would completely wind down its operations following publication and destroy all stored information.





Celebrating its growth, the Drainer expressed gratitude to its supporters, although ironic considering the extensive losses the group inflicted on the industry. Pink Drainer did not depart without offering some “words of wisdom” to its victims.



“If you have enough money right now to financially support yourself, we advise you to hold onto it and take a step back from the grind and enjoy what this world has to offer. Life is too short to get caught in the perpetual cycle of needlessly spending, going broke, and trying to make it back,” the message stated.



While the group asserted the finality of its decision by cautioning, “beware of impersonators; we are not planning on returning in the future,” the crypto industry remains vulnerable to similar threats from other drainers.



Crypto Wallet Drainers Plague



According to the January analysis by Web3 security platform Scam Sniffer, several wallet drainers are responsible for deploying crypto-related malware on phishing websites to grant threat actors unauthorized access to unsuspecting users’ accounts.




In addition to Pink Drainer, which announced its exit, other notorious ones include Inferno Drainer, MS Drainer, Angel Drainer, Monkey Drainer, and Venom Drainer.





Inferno Drainer and Monkey Drainer reportedly orchestrated some of the most notable heists of 2023 before their exposure, siphoning off over $81 million and $16 million over months, respectively. 



Many of these malicious groups continue to lurk in the industry’s shadows, becoming adept at circumventing promotion guidelines on trusted social media platforms like Google and Twitter, which enables them to promote malicious URLs to a broader range of investors for selfish gain.

Tether's USDT Faces Potential Delisting From Kraken's Platform Within 2 Months: Details | Bitcoinist.com


								In a move that could have significant implications for the global cryptocurrency market, the US-based crypto exchange Kraken is “actively reviewing” plans, including removing support for Tether’s USDT stablecoin within the European Union (EU).
The potential delisting comes as the EU prepares to implement a new regulatory framework, Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), set to take effect in July. According to a Bloomberg report, the upcoming EU rules are expected to impact USDT, the world’s most-traded cryptocurrency.
Kraken Considers Tether’s USDT Delisting In Europe
MiCA, which the European Banking Authority (EBA) is still finalizing, will restrict the sale of stablecoins to EU investors. 

Traders widely use stablecoins like USDT to move digital assets between exchanges or to store wealth away from token price volatility. Marcus Hughes, Kraken’s global head of regulatory strategy, stated:
We’re absolutely planning for all eventualities, including situations where it’s just not tenable to list specific tokens such as USDT. It’s something that we’re actively reviewing, and as the position becomes clearer, we can take firm decisions on that.
Tether, the issuer of USDT, acknowledged Kraken’s remarks, stating that the firm expects exchanges to “rightfully focus on EUR liquidity for European customers while maintaining USDT as an on-ramp off-ramp solution.” 
However, Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, has previously expressed concerns about certain aspects of MiCA’s requirements, and the company has no plans to be regulated under the new rules in the medium term. 
The potential delisting of USDT on Kraken’s European platform follows a similar move by another major crypto exchange, OKX, which removed EU users’ ability to buy or sell other cryptocurrencies using USDT earlier this year. Hughes further claimed:
It’s an evolving picture. What we’re clear on is that the scope of the type and number of stablecoins that are offered today in Europe are unlikely to be able to be offered going forward. At some point in the future, there’ll be a cut off at which that won’t be possible.
Kraken Evaluates European HQ Options
For further context, the upcoming MiCA regulations will require issuers of asset-referenced and e-money tokens, like USDT, to hold a license from a national financial authority in at least one EU member state by June 30. 
Issuers will also be mandated to meet “higher standards” on corporate governance, conflicts of interest, and reserve management, such as holding at least a third of all funds at an independent credit institution.

Per the report, as Kraken navigates the changing regulatory landscape, the exchange is also in the “advanced stages” of selecting its post-MiCA European headquarters, with France and Ireland emerging as popular destinations among its rivals, such as Coinbase, Binance, and Gemini.
However, if Kraken moves forward with delisting Tether’s USDT stablecoin from its European platform, it could have significant implications for the exchange’s users and customers in the EU. 
Kraken’s European customers would no longer be able to directly trade or transact using USDT, potentially leading to decreased liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads, increased price volatility, and lower trading volumes. 
This could create inconvenience and disruption for customers accustomed to using Tether’s stablecoin, as they may need to explore alternative stablecoins like Circle’s USDC or fiat on-ramps, adding complexity to their cryptocurrency transactions.

One Week to Go Until the Big Day: Analysts Update Expectations for Ethereum Spot ETF Decision - Bitcoin Sistemi

Investment companies eager to introduce the first ETFs based on Ethereum face potential disappointment. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not yet indicated it is ready to approve such products.
After months of silence, the US regulator is expected to announce its decision next week on at least one application for an ETF that invests directly in Ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. Some fund companies are expecting a rejection, citing less robust private dialogues with the SEC than before the approval of spot-Bitcoin ETFs in January.


In the weeks leading up to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, fund companies submitted multiple versions of revised paperwork to address the SEC's concerns, a process that significantly contributed to their final approval. However, spot ETH ETF filings have seen much less activity.
“Most people generally expect a rejection,” said Katherine Dowling, general counsel at Bitwise, which filed for a spot ETH ETF in March. and added: “You're not seeing the kind of public activity that you would see if there were to be an approval.”






The SEC, which postponed decisions on fund applications for several months, has until May 23 to approve or reject VanEck's application. ETH's value fell nearly 20% in April as approval hopes faded.
“If the SEC doesn't approve ETH ETFs now, it may be because the line the SEC has drawn is that they won't approve any spot crypto product without an actual court order,” said Jeremy Senderowicz, an attorney specializing in investment services at law firm Vedder Price.


Whatever the outcome, for the first time the SEC will provide significant public information about its position on spot Ether ETFs. Even among issuers who are pessimistic about the regulator approving the product, this is seen as a ray of hope as it will give a concrete idea about the regulator's thoughts on these products.

                        As blue-chip cryptocurrencies post a strong finish to the week, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL) up 2.5%-5.5% each over the past 24 hours, traders are turning to the on-chain meme coin markets as they hunt for top crypto gainers today.Bitcoin topped $67,000 on Friday, while Ether and Solana rallied to the upper $3,000s and $160s respectively.US CPI data earlier this week bolstered hopes for multiple Fed interest rate cuts later in the year.That helped launch major US equity indices back to record highs, whilst weighing on the US Dollar and US yields.Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have also risen this week. As per The Block data, inflows are already above $750 million since Monday.Traders are hunting for top crypto gainers today as spot Bitcoin ETF inflows return. Source: The BlockMeanwhile, more than 500 asset managers revealing exposure to the new Bitcoin ETFs in their 13F filings.These include some major and some surprising names, such as Morgan Stanley and a US state pension fund.On net, in wake of all this bullish news flow, it’s no surprise that cryptos are trading with decent momentum.Let’s not forget that GameStop icon Roaring Kitty also returned on Monday, injecting huge excitement into meme stock/meme coin markets.With most major cryptos still some way below yearly highs, the outlook for a continued rally is good.However, for some impatient traders, the prospect of a 10-20% rally in a few weeks isn’t nearly enough.These traders prefer to turn to the highly illiquid and volatile on-chain markets.Traders frequently turn to tools like DEXScreener to hunt for newly issued cryptos that might quickly 100x.Here are some of the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum that they will be watching.Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXScreenerSPURDO (SPURDO)A just-launched meme coin called SPURDO (SPURDO) is pumping on Friday, up 323% in 24 hours as per DEXScreener.https://twitter.com/SpurdosCoin/status/1791327544786231712Its market cap was last around $1.3 million, following a substantial pullback from earlier session highs.The token has $150,000 in locked liquidity, plus three concerning issues with its smart contract, as identified by Go+ Security.Traders should always do their due diligence before investing in new coins. Most are scams/pump-and-dumps.Brett (BRETT)An Ethereum copycat version of popular Solana meme coin Brett (BRETT) is pumping hard, up 200% on Friday.As per DEXScreener, its market cap was last around $4.6 million with $260,000 in locked liquidity.Go+ Security identifies two smart contract issues, a blacklist and a white list.Amaterasu Omikami (OMIKAMI)An old meme coin called Amaterasu Omikami (OMIKAMI), that was launched back in 2022, is coming back strong on Friday.After gaining over 60% in 24 hours and 250% in two days, OMIKAMI has reached a $10 million market cap.The token currently has $440,000 in locked liquidity, and is unlikely to be a scam given how old it is.Better Crypto Alternatives to Consider
Trading new meme coins is fraught with risk. Sure, some of these coins might 100x or more.But traders are very unlikely to get in right at the bottom. And the vast majority of coins will fall flat, with investors unlikely to be able to find the liquidity to sell.Moreover, the meme coin market’s fast price action tends to trigger FOMO in traders. They often neglect to do the required due diligence.A potentially better alternative to investing in just-launched meme coins is to invest in presales.Here, traders have more time to research a project and see if it is a good fit for them.If investors are able to reliably identify projects that gain traction, they can make big gains.With so many presales out there vying for invest funds, it can be tough to know where to start.That’s why analysts at Cryptonews keep a close eye on the presale market. Here are some of their top presales for 2024.21 Best Crypto Presales to Invest In Now

                        Oklahoma passed a bill on May 13 to protect the rights of its residents to self-custody their digital assets.The legislation, known as OKHB3594, was signed into law by Governor Kevin Stitt and sponsored by four Republicans: State Senators Bill Coleman and Dana Prieto and State Representatives Brian Hill and Cody Maynard.The bill prohibits any restrictions or bans on using self-custody or hardware wallets to store digital assets, which ensures that individuals in Oklahoma have the freedom to control and safeguard their own digital assets without interference from third parties.The legislation also allows Oklahomans to engage in both home-based and industrial crypto mining as long as they comply with local noise ordinances.Self-Custody Bill to Go into Effect This November
The digital asset self-custody bill will go into effect on November 1, 2024.One notable provision of the bill is the exemption of crypto miners from obtaining a money transmitter license.This means that individuals involved in home digital asset mining or running digital asset mining businesses, as well as those engaged in staking or staking as a service, are not required to acquire a license typically associated with financial transactions.Additionally, the bill outlaws discriminatory electricity rates for digital asset mining businesses, ensuring fair treatment in terms of energy costs.The legislation also addresses the use of digital assets as a payment method.Oklahoma residents can utilize cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services without being subjected to additional taxes, withholdings, assessments, or charges imposed solely because of the use of digital assets in transactions.Dennis Porter, the CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, emphasized the bill’s importance in protecting fundamental Bitcoin rights.“Without the ability to manage our wealth, we lose control of our destiny and the chance to create better futures for our families,” he wrote in a post on X. “This law ensures that everyone can secure not only their [bitcoin] but all their assets.”Countries Consider Crypto Seizure for Tax Evasion
Countries worldwide are increasingly considering confiscating crypto assets for debt collection from taxpayers.South Korean tax officials in the city of Pohang revealed plans to seize crypto from 5,208 residents who failed to pay local taxes.Per local reports, the individuals have all evaded local tax bills worth $370 or above.The drive saw tax officials seize almost $29 million in coins and fiat in 2023.Likewise, the Spanish Ministry of Finance wants to enable the seizure of digital assets to settle tax debts.Under the leadership of María Jesús Montero, the ministry is currently working on legislative reforms to the General Tax Law.The proposed changes would grant the Spanish Tax Agency the authority to identify and control crypto assets owned by taxpayers with outstanding debts.

                        Sam Trabucco, the co-CEO of Alameda Research, has spoken out in support of FTX executive Ryan Salame ahead of his sentencing on May 28, according to an updated May 14 court filing.In a character reference for the former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO, Trabucco described Salame as an “affable” and “complex” person who “doesn’t deserve to be defined by his worst actions.”Alameda Research’s Sam Trabucco Defends FTX Exec Ryan Salame
“Simply put, Ryan is my best friend. He has also committed crimes,” Trabucco wrote. “He’s acknowledged that and is prepared to accept the consequences.”Trabucco further said that he had hoped Salame would receive a “fair” sentence in relation to the digital asset scandal, referring to him as a “sought-after employee in the crypto space.”Salame, who recently requested a sentencing length of eighteen months in prison, pled guilty to conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting license and conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions back in September 2023.Salame has largely distanced himself from the doomed crypto exchange, with lawyers for the FTX executive arguing that he had limited knowledge of the company’s $8 billion fraud scheme.“As was true for thousands of other FTX employees, customers, investors, and lenders, Ryan lost years of hard work and nearly his entire net worth almost instantaneously,” the court filing read. “Ryan, who was not part of Sam Bankman-Fried’s innermost circle, was unaware of the crimes at the center of this case.”Salame In Hot Water Over SBF Political Donations, Faces Prison Time
Salame’s unlawful political contributions charge stems from over 300 secret donations totaling tens of millions of dollars made by Bankman-Fried, with the willing participation of the former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO and the company’s Head of Engineering, Nishad Singh.Prosecutors allege Bankman-Fried, who is currently serving 25 years in prison for orchestrating the fraud scheme, used the straw donor scheme to levy influence and power to pro-crypto politicians.Of course, these donations were largely funded by FTX customers’ money, which Bankman-Fried stole and used to fund venture investments, real estate purchases, and more while claiming investors’ funds were safe.“He built a pyramid of deceit on a foundation of lies and false promises,” U.S. prosecutors claimed during SBF’s trial. “And when it collapsed, it left a trail of destruction in its wake.”Salame’s sentencing will take place at Manhattan federal court on May 28 at 11 a.m. He is facing a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

FLOKI To Burn 15.2B Coins, Solidifying Bullish Pennant Setup - DailyCoin


        

The FLOKI coin community chooses to burn $3.2M worth of FLOKI tokens.



FLOKI briefly ranked as the #1 altcoin by combining social and trading activity.



Analysts mark FLOKI’s bullish pennant, reinforcing new all-time high hopes.




A new proposal by FLOKI’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) suggests burning 15,246,000,000 excessive FLOKI tokens. The Floki burning proposal quickly gained traction among community members, who have almost unanimously voted to implement it.



According to the results, 99.84% of voters agreed to burn the 15.2B Floki coins, as the proposal overviewed the previous three burns initiated by Floki DAO. Back in July 2022, the Floki community had a vote on whether or not to burn the excessive tokens recovered from a blacklisted wallet, while another 4.97T Floki coins were burned by the community’s decision in January 2023.







Further, Floki holders voted to burn another 190B FLOKI coins in February 2024, retrieved from the multi-chain bridge. Notably, the latest FLOKI DAO burning campaign has fewer Floki coins than the first three DAO-initiated burns.




However, the deed aligns with FLOKI’s goal to remain a deflationary cryptocurrency fully controlled by the community’s decisions. According to the proposal’s description, the burns will be executed one week after approval.



FLOKI Crowned The New Social Champion



Along with the upcoming $3.2 million FLOKI burn, the Viking horn-themed canine cryptocurrency has recently shown a remarkable record in combined social and trading activity. LunarCrush, a social blockchain data enterprise that closely tracks the sentiment surrounding the most talked-about cryptocurrencies, calculates this unique metric.







Since last week, FLOKI has championed the social on-chain metrics with a steady increase in social mentions, trading volume, and FLOKI’s market price simultaneously. LunarCrush spotted the beginning of this trend on May 11, 2024, as the Viking dog-themed crypto climbed the social intelligence company’s rankings.




Starting at the #977 position on May 11, 2024, FLOKI continued its social dominance to claim the #1 position in LunarCrush’s AltRank by May 15, 2024. That day, Floki embarked on a 23% bull run to claim a new monthly peak at $0.0002265, according to CoinGecko.



Bullish Pennant To Stir Up A New Peak?



As Floki’s bullish momentum escalates, traders are looking for validation of FLOKI’s bullish pennant status. A pennant is a continuation pattern formed by a flagpole and followed by converging trend lines, signaling a phased consolidation period. The pennant is then followed by a breakout in the same direction as the initial large price movement.







According to crypto analyst World Of Charts, Floki broke the bullish pennant in a 12-hour time frame on May 13, 2024. This price movement showcases a 120% to 130% bull run potential, World Of Charts claims. If that’s the case, FLOKI could erupt into a new all-time high. 



As of press time, FLOKI is changing hands at $0.0002122, with a 2.2% increase over the past 24 hours. Still 37.7% down from the all-time peak, FLOKI maintains a bullish stance with 57.7% monthly gains.



On the Flipside




Other key on-chain indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) index, gave mixed signals.



To illustrate the ambiguity, the CMF index, used to define large holder interest, was slightly negative at -0.06.



Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was completely neutral at 50, neither oversold nor overbought.




Why This Matters



GameStop stock rejuvenation this week has served a major boost for the meme coin department, setting off double-digit runs for most popular meme currencies.

Is Avalanche (AVAX) Set for Consolidation?


Avalanche’s (AVAX) price is expected to remain consolidated owing to the lack of substantial growth expected from the altcoin.
AVAX holders also exhibit a selling sentiment since short-term investors dominate the supply.
Avalanche Investors Look to Sell

Avalanche’s price could soon observe the impact of investors’ behavior; the supply is dominated by short-term holders known to hold their supply for one month or less. 
This makes their holdings susceptible to selling. In the case of AVAX, nearly 28% of all circulating AVAX is in their hands. Forty percent of the AVAX is still held by mid-term investors who hold their assets for over a month and less than a year.
However, 28% still makes up for over 107 million AVAX, making these investors a major threat to Avalanche’s price.

Secondly, Avalanche’s price will face significant resistance owing to a massive demand barrier. According to the Global In/Out of the Money indicator (GIOM), about 12.47 million AVAX await profits. This supply was bought at an average price of $38, making it worth over $473 million.
This would require strong bullish cues, as AVAX would have to push to $42 to ascertain absolute and complete profits. However, considering the market conditions, this may not happen.
Read More: How To Buy Avalanche (AVAX) and Everything You Need To Know

As a result, Avalanche’s price will fall back down.
AVAX Price Prediction: Consolidation Ahead
Avalanche’s price, $36, has rallied 15% in the past three days, pulling it up from $31. The latter marked the lower limit of the consolidation range AVAX has been stuck in for a month. The upper limit stands at $39.

The altcoin has attempted to break out of this consolidation nearly three times in the last month but has failed each time. Even during this week’s rally, AVAX only made it halfway. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency has been unable to invalidate the death cross that occurred over six weeks ago.
The bearish influence will continue until the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crosses over the 200-day EMA. As a result, Avalanche’s price will likely remain consolidated until the end of the month.

However, the bullish thesis could be invalidated if the winds shift and AVAX investors opt not to sell but push forward instead. AVAX would need to break out of the consolidation and flip $39 into support.

Vitalik Addresses MEV and Decentralization Concerns | Bankless


Today, Vitalik Buterin published a new blog post outlining strategies to enhance Ethereum’s “permissionlessness and decentralization.” The post was inspired by Geth core developer Péter Szilágyi’s concerns on maximal extractable value (MEV) and the specter of centralization. What's the context?In a May 16 Twitter thread, Szilágyi argued the Ethereum community has prioritized vested interests and quick fixes over the protocol’s integrity. He decried the acceptance of MEV, liquid staking, and increasing hardware requirements as leading to centralization and making Ethereum similar to traditional financial systems, leading to a wider debate with Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist.tl;dr of Vitalik’s ResponseIn his new May 17 post, Buterin said these were “valid concerns” but asserted the situation wasn’t “anywhere near as hopeless as Peter’s tweets imply.” He emphasized that many of these issues were already being addressed through ongoing protocol improvements and roadmap tweaks, including:MEV minimization — Promoting MEV-free apps like CoW Swap and implementing encrypted mempools to prevent front-running attacksMEV quarantining — Using proposer/builder separation (PBS) and inclusion lists to limit the power to exclude transactionsVerkle trees and EIP-4444 — For reducing hardware requirements, expanding validator sets, and improving node operation efficiency and storage requirementsButerin concluded by acknowledging past over-reliance on “large-scale actors,” but added that Ethereum has shifted considerably toward true decentralization in recent years and that while there is plenty of work left to do, the ongoing progress is promising. Bankless take:It would be a travesty for Ethereum to turn into a captured TradFi-like behemoth, yet as Buterin pointed out in his new post, the network has moved considerably away from this specter through various ongoing development efforts, and with no signs of slowing down here.Of course, it will take years for Ethereum to complete the full arc of its decentralization journey, but the wait will be worth the end result: a remarkably robust base layer that can “hyper-scale” in all directions with Layer 2 (L2) networks. This vision is best realized by focusing on decentralization now, not later.

The Biden Administration’s SEC may be unwilling to expend political capital on a denial.Layer 2 Boon: Leading L2s now constitute 17% of aggregate DEX volumes, and are acting as massive ETH sinks, helping drive demand for ETH as a monetary asset, meanwhile Arbitrum and Base have seen explosive growth in stablecoin supply.Staker Support: ETH has been inflationary for over a month, but the growth in staked ETH has vastly outpaced the rate of issuance and stakers are not structurally forced to sell ETH to support operations, like BTC miners.Ethereum’s Edge: Ether’s usage across Ethereum-native DeFi, the ecosystem’s consistent drive to decentralize, a rapid pace of L2 innovation, the proliferation of the EVM, and L1 blockspace demand to tokenize real world assets are all long term strengths could allow Ethereum to retain dominance.  Bankless Take:Crypto has increasingly become an election issue, but only because the Biden Administration has taken a clear stance against the industry, making it unrealistic that the SEC of this hostile administration would approve spot ETH ETFs solely based on political concerns.The SEC’s October approval of ETH ETFs holding commodity futures suggests that the SEC viewed Ether as a non-security at that time, indicating spot instruments should receive approval on May 23 despite the overwhelming amount of evidence to the contrary. Although ETH sentiment is low, an unexpected approval likely reverses the tide; alternatively, a denial likely lays out the SEC’s case for why Ether is a security and could cause problems for alts.

Telegram Founder Pavel Durov Says He’ll Hold $7 Million Notcoin Gift Until 100x - Decrypt

Notcoin users were feeling generous ahead of Thursday’s NOT token launch, as over half a million players of the viral Telegram-based clicker game donated a share of their in-game coins to Telegram founder Pavel Durov. Now that haul is worth millions of dollars—and Durov says he’s holding for a potential 100x gain.More than 552,000 players of Notcoin donated a share of their in-game coins to Durov back in February, part of an effort by the Notcoin team—called Open Builders—to thank the Telegram founder for the messaging app that houses the crypto game.Ultimately, Durov ended up with over 1.03 billion NOT tokens, or just over 1% of the total Notcoin supply on The Open Network (TON). That’s worth about $7.3 million as of this writing, but was a bit lower at $6.8 million when Durov posted earlier Friday.Durov, who’s estimated to have a $15.5 billion fortune by Forbes, hardly needs the cash. And he’s not selling. But should the NOT token surge in value, he says he’d sell them to ultimately better support Telegram.“Half a million Notcoin users gifted me $6.8 million worth of Notcoin! Thank you,” Durov wrote on Telegram. “I will hold these coins until they turn to $680 million, at which point I will use them to buy more servers for Telegram.”Notcoin is this year’s biggest gaming token launch so far, debuting at a market cap of nearly $1.5 billion early Thursday. New cryptocurrencies are often volatile, and indeed, NOT has plunged in value since the debut—dropping by 50% to a current price just above $0.007, according to CoinMarketCap.Even so, NOT is the 101st most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap at $746 million, and racked up more than $1 billion worth of trading volume in its first 24 hours after launch.Notcoin paused its coin-tapping gameplay in April to prepare for the token rollout, but it set to relaunch its crypto-earning game—and ultimately serve as a platform for additional games in an effort to become the “Netflix of social, viral games,” co-creator Sasha Plotvinov told Decrypt’s GG in April.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Ethereum price rallies above $3.1K after unexpected regulatory victory

Ether (ETH) price rose by 5.5% on May 17, nearing $3,100 for the first time in 10 days. Analysts attributed this rally to a decrease in demand for fixed-income instruments following stagnant United States retail sales data in April. This data increased the market’s expectation of a potential interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve to boost the economy.Expansionary measures by the central bank are typically seen as bullish for risk-on markets, whether due to an increased monetary supply or reduced credit costs for businesses and individuals. Investors sought exposure to scarce assets, including cryptocurrencies, leading to gold reaching $2,410, just 0.8% below its all-time high.A court ruling gave Ether investors a confidence boostEther’s surge was also driven by a U.S. Department of Justice indictment unsealed on May 15. The indictment accused two individuals of wire fraud and money laundering by manipulating the Ethereum blockchain. The document stated that “Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain […] without the need for a trusted intermediary” and added, “No central actor runs the Ethereum Network.”Additionally, the court noted that Ethereum smart contracts enable transactions without a trusted intermediary. These statements boosted Ether investors’ confidence, especially after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Wells notice to the trading platform Robinhood on May 4 over alleged securities violations related to crypto listings and custodian operations.According to Orlando Cosme, founder and CEO of Lexproof, such a verdict contradicts regulators’ classification of ETH as a security, “as there would be no management or entrepreneurial efforts of others.” While this analysis does not change the approval odds of U.S. spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), it certainly lifted investors’ spirits.The U.S. SEC is expected to provide its final ruling on VanEck’s spot Ether ETF request on March 23 and rule on the conversion of Grayscale’s ETHE fund by June 18. Although analysts predict approval odds below 35%, the regulators’ case for classifying Ether as a security instrument has weakened, which might have contributed to the rally above $3,050 on May 17.Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko praised Ethereum’s network security, highlighting how coordinating “an invalid state transition or double spend attack” would be nearly impossible. In a May 17 post, Yakovenko added that layer-2 scaling reduced costs without compromising security due to the network’s large number of validators and operators.In short, investors realized that whatever setbacks Ethereum faced, including high transaction fees and its lackluster efforts to increase scalability, were, in fact, decisions that prioritized security and decentralization. Meanwhile, competitors Solana and BNB Chain opted for solutions that allowed a higher processing capacity, regardless of the merits of increasing dependency on fewer entities.Ethereum network’s dominance remains undisputedEthereum’s strength becomes evident when analyzing its dominance in decentralized application (DApp) activity. The growth of layer-2 solutions such as Base, which quickly gained traction due to its low fees and integration with the U.S.’s largest crypto exchange, Coinbase, further reinforces Ethereum’s ability to become a global settlement layer.Top blockchains ranked by 30-day Dapps volumes, USD. Source: DappRadarEthereum’s $181.5 billion in DApp volume over 30 days is more than seven times larger than its direct competitor, BNB Chain. More importantly, this volume declined merely 3% compared to the previous month, while BNB Chain and Solana experienced 52% and 41% decreases in volume, respectively.Related: U.S. Senate passes resolution overturning SEC crypto rule on banksAnalyzing unique active addresses engaging with DApps yields similar results, with Ethereum gaining 3% in 30 days while BNB Chain and Solana faced steep declines. Highlights from the Ethereum network include Balancer, which saw a 34% volume increase in 30 days, Morpho Optimizers, which gained 80%, and DODO, with a 61% volume boost.In essence, even if the U.S. spot Ether ETF approval odds remain low, investors are realizing that the network’s dominance in the DApp ecosystem remains unaffected. This realization contributed to the ETH price gains on May 17. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Is Tether Minting $1 Billion USDT a Sign of Upcoming Surge? - DailyCoin


        

Bitcoin’s price has surged past $66,000 coinciding with positive news on inflation.



Tether has minted billions of tokens, fueling speculation about its impact on Bitcoin’s price.



Stablecoin holdings on exchanges have surged, raising liquidity and potentially increasing market volatility.




The cryptocurrency market is showing signs of renewed life as Bitcoin surges past $66,000, coinciding with positive news on the US inflation front. This rally comes alongside a significant rise in stablecoin holdings on crypto exchanges, potentially setting the stage for a broader market upswing.



Stablecoin Supply on the Rise



Data from Lookonchain reveals that Tether, a major stablecoin issuer, minted an additional $1 billion worth of USDT tokens just 13 hours ago. This follows a trend of increased minting throughout the past month, with Tether’s market cap rising from $108 billion to over $111 billion. 







In total, Tether has minted a staggering 31 billion USDT tokens over the past year, potentially fueling the rise in Bitcoin’s price from $27,000 to $73,000. 




This trend extends beyond Tether. According to Woominkyu on CryptoQuant, a market analysis firm, there has been a recent surge in overall stablecoin inflows, suggesting a significant influx of fresh capital entering the cryptocurrency market. 



This increased liquidity has the potential to significantly impact Bitcoin’s price dynamics, with the possibility of heightened volatility as supply and demand forces adjust.



Bitcoin in a Consolidation Phase



While the influx of stablecoins suggests a potential market rally, cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo believes Bitcoin is currently in a “warm-up phase” within its liquidity cycle. Woo points out that Bitcoin is consolidating below its all-time highs, indicating a period of relatively low long-term risk for investors. 







He highlights that significant market activity tends to correlate with increased risk, suggesting the current phase offers a degree of stability. The combined factors of a rising Bitcoin price, increased stablecoin holdings, and a cautious yet optimistic market outlook paint a picture of a crypto market preparing for potential growth. 




While future volatility is a possibility, the current trends suggest a market primed for further movement. Overall, the rise in stablecoin activity injects optimism into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts like Woo caution that Bitcoin’s price may experience volatility as the market absorbs this influx of liquidity.



On the Flipside




While a rise in stablecoins can signal new investment, it can also indicate investors seeking to hedge their bets or move capital out of riskier assets.



A downturn in traditional markets could still impact the crypto market, even with an influx of stablecoins.



The rise in stablecoin supply might not directly cause a sustained Bitcoin price increase.




Why This Matters



The surge in stablecoin holdings, particularly Tether’s minting of new tokens, coincides with Bitcoin’s price rise and suggests a potential influx of fresh capital. This increased liquidity could fuel a broader market upswing but also heighten volatility as supply and demand forces adjust within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

All Bitcoin Sold: Analyst Reveals Why He Swapped To Altcoins


								A prominent figure in the crypto space revealed he has sold all his Bitcoin (BTC) holdings in favor of Altcoins. In an X post, the market expert claimed to still have faith in the flagship cryptocurrency and explained what he did and the reasons why.

Expert Takes A Risk To Get More Bitcoin
On Thursday, renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe announced to his X followers that he had sold all his Bitcoin holdings. He prefaced his explanation by stating that he had not lost his faith in BTC.
The expert explained he is not expecting the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to be “topped out for this cycle.” Additionally, he clarified that he has not become a “complete believer in gold.”
 

Van de Poppe’s annoucement. Source: Michael van de Poppe on X
Van de Poppe’s goal is to buy back more Bitcoin later in the year since “It’s a bull cycle; we can’t deny that.” However, he explains that the simplicity of the four-year cycle and the impact of “Halving” events will reduce over time as Bitcoin becomes a mature asset worldwide and institutions prioritize “risk appetite in their portfolios.”
According to the analyst, “It’s all about risk,” and institutions will de-risk when liquidity dries up. As a result, this cycle may be the final “easy” cycle to make big profits through altcoins.
He asserted that he must take a risk as a 31-year-old entrepreneur who has been surviving several bull and bear markets since 2017. To obtain more Bitcoin, van de Poppe decided to trade Altcoins within the Web 3.0 ecosystem, which he considers the riskiest path:
“I know the tides, and I know that to get a large return, you’ll need to get more knowledge and dare to take the risk against all odds and sentiment. That’s where I fancy it the most and where I’ve had periods when things went south. Can’t deny that.”
Altcoins Poised For Big Returns
Further explaining why he chose this path to earn back his Bitcoin, the analyst stated that “altcoins have been crushed unreasonably hard” during this cycle. Due to this, van de Poppe is considering several events that could make or break his bet on altcoins.
First, he listed the slim chances of an Ethereum (ETH) spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETH) being approved alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s crackdown on ETH. The clarification on the status of the second-largest cryptocurrency could “make a significant U-turn.”
Second, the results of the US House of Representatives vote regarding the FIT21 bill could provide a clearer regulatory framework for the crypto industry in the US. Lastly, the outcome of the XRP lawsuit, which he believes will result in the asset not being classified as a security, could also positively affect the market.
Van de Poppe stated that the upside of his bet cannot be denied. Nonetheless, he recognizes that the downside is relatively huge. The expert explained he’s currently 20% down on the overall investment in two weeks, claiming that he’ll be fine with the possibility of losing 50-80% of his investment.
For the analyst, the chances of making a 300-900% return in the coming 6 to 12 months outweigh the risks. With the possibility of earning between 900% and 4500% in the next one to two years, van de Poppe is “happily allocating entirely towards altcoins.”  He closed his post optimistically stating, “The bull cycle will be glorious.”

Ghana, Singapore conduct trade in semi-fungible token pilot project

The Bank of Ghana (BOG) and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) have completed a proof-of-concept for the Digital Economy Semi-Fungible Token (DESFT) Project, according to various local press reports. The project is intended to encourage trade between micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the two countries.Within the project, live transactions have been carried out between the sides. To do so, they leveraged the Universal Trusted Credentials semi-fungible token protocol developed by the United Nations Development Program, according to Singapore-based Ample FinTech, which identified itself as the developer of the DESFT. The token contained verified licenses, certificates and trade records.A stablecoin pegged to the Singapore dollar (XSGD) and the BOG’s e-cedi central bank digital currency (CBDC) were used for exchange within a Purpose Bound Money protocol on a distributed ledger.Source: Fintech Association of Kenya The MAS developed the Purpose Bound Money protocol in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund and the central banks of Italy and South Korea. It incorporates both programmable money and programmable payment technology and has been tested by Amazon and other international retailers.Related: Bank of Ghana to foster financial inclusion through CBDC projectBank of Ghana director of fintech and innovation Kwame Oppong described the project at the 3i Africa Summit in Accra. He said:“After nearly a year and two phases of development, we have crafted a reliable information exchange solution founded on UTC standards and Semi-fungible Token technology […] and conducted real trade experiments which fully align with our predetermined objectives.” Oppong continued that the project's future development would focus on supply chain finance and payments across multiple digital currencies. Details were scarce in the press about the semi-fungible token technology. Ample FinTech said it operates on the ERC-3525 standard on top of the Ethereum blockchain.According to an announcement of a panel discussion scheduled for the Singapore Fintech Festival in November, the Digital Economy Semi-Fungible Token “combines NFTs and traditional blockchain information” that enables the tokenization of self-ownership through the DESFT. The e-cedi is in its pilot phase.

How a Crypto Trader Made Over $100K With Two Tweets - Decrypt

Ethereum layer-2 solution Blast continues to be a lucrative place to earn money. On Thursday, Twitter user Punk9059—a notable pseudonymous crypto personality—said he had made well over $100,000 worth of crypto primarily from posting two tweets related to the Pacmoon meme coin.“I got paid over $100k for two tweets,” Punk9059 tweeted. “What's crazy is I had no idea it would happen.”Pacmoon is a meme coin on the Blast network, which launched its mainnet in late February. The Blast network has attracted considerable attention, amassing over $1.4 billion in total value locked ahead of its upcoming BLAST token airdrop in late June.Meme coins are tokens based on internet memes, celebrities, or brands. Pacmoon uses Pac-Man-inspired visuals, and rewards social media interaction and community engagement by giving supporters tokens for sharing relevant content.Showing the tweets, Punk9059—who works for Memeland, and previously was at Proof—said that the first tweet was of news of a free airdrop of Pacmoon (PAC) tokens to Blast stakeholders, along with his referral code, on February 28. It was a popular tweet, sure, but the benefits were even bigger than expected thanks to a mistake.“This tweet went viral,” Punk9059 said. “People copy/pasted the wording. And my friend [Frank DeGods] mistakenly tweeted my code instead of his own.”Frank DeGods, aka Rohun Vora, is the founder of the DeGods and y00ts NFT projects and commands a sizable following on Twitter. His mistaken referral code share ultimately paid off big for Punk9059—though at the time, the PAC token wasn’t worth very much.Punk9059 said he gave Frank $50 as a thank you after he mistakenly tweeted out the wrong referral code. And that tweet, including the photo of Frank holding a $50 bill while being embraced by Punk9059, also went viral—so more rewards gained.He received 354,179 PAC for referrals, followed by another 698,137 PAC tokens for tweet views, ultimately totaling 1,052,316 tokens—which equaled $168,370 as of Thursday. As of this writing, that tally is worth about $218,000 with PAC up 7% over the past 24 hours.“There were a couple more tweets in the mix, but these two did the lion's share of the work,” Punk9059 said. “The best part? My followers got a W too if they saw the tweet & registered.”“We’ll take it,” he added.Punk9059 did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Two Giant Whales Became Active: They Made Big Trades in These Altcoins - Bitcoin Sistemi


It seems like a lot of whales have been active in the cryptocurrency market in recent hours.
According to onchain data provided by Lookonchain, the whale with short address 0x8036, which we will talk about first, first purchased $ 5.7 million worth of Ethereum on the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini. This wallet was created from scratch approximately 1 day ago.



Then, the whale in question used all of the ETH he withdrawn to buy Ondo (ONDO). Whale purchased 6 million ONDO tokens at an average price of $0.95. At the time of writing this article, ONDO price is trading at $0.93.
Another whale that has been active in recent hours seems to have experienced a very unfortunate situation. Roosh, a well-known whale in the cryptocurrency market, sold a large amount of Chainlink (LINK) worth $ 2.78 million. Unfortunately, after the whale sold, there was an 18% increase in the LINK price. According to the data, if the whale wallet had waited a little longer, it could have made an additional profit of $497. At the time of writing this article, LINK is trading at $16.20.

Bitcoin ETFs Record $300 Million in Net Inflows as Bitcoin Nears $67,000 ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Net inflows into the 9 spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) reached $300 million yesterday as the market experienced a healthy bullish phase. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had been languishing below $63k for the better part of the last three weeks, so this price rally was a breath of fresh air for the bullish cause.



Daily ETF Flow



According to Bitcoin ETF Flow data, the net inflow for the ETFs was $303 million on May 15, 2024. Here is the entire breakdown:



Image Source: Farside



According to the spreadsheet, Fidelity’s FBTC fund was the biggest gainer, with a net inflow of $131 million, dwarfing the rest of the pack considerably. BitWise’s BITB and ARK Invest’s ARKB ETFs stood second and third, with $86.3 million and $38.6 million, respectively. The remaining five spot ETFs, including Grayscale, were in single digits.



Bitcoin ETFs Hit the Ground Running



Bitcoin ETFs hit the ground running after being approved at the end of January this year. They have become the best-performing ETFs ever launched in the history of exchange funds. Four top spot ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT, FBTC, ARKB, and BitWise, have seen a massive $28 billion worth of buying in just three and a half months.



After the success in America, several other financial destinations have launched their spot crypto ETFs. Hong Kong, in particular, not only launched three Bitcoin funds but also allowed the same three companies to file for Ethereum ETFs, which were also approved. However, the Hong Kong-based funds couldn’t perform as well as their counterparts across the Pacific Ocean. The US has taken the lead here even though it wasn’t the first to cross the line.

&nbsp



However, the performance in the last few weeks has slowed as the crypto market has suffered overall. The end of April witnessed considerable net outflows, with all the top ETFs bleeding value.



The Future



While the total $28 billion invested in US-based Bitcoin ETFs is peanuts compared to the multi-trillion valuation of the entire crypto market, it is important to note that this is a long-term play. 



These ETFs are being eyed by top investment banks worldwide, with big names like BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan already dipping into the market. The US state of Wisconsin has also bought $100 million worth of shares in the ARKB ETF, and that is just one state. It is predicted that sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and national treasuries will invest in Bitcoin in the near future.

Alleged crypto scammers arrested in 'pig butchering' scheme

The Justice Department said on Friday that it arrested two alleged scammers for laundering “at least” $73 million through shell companies connected to “pig butchering” cryptocurrency investment schemes. Nvidia stock has all-time closing high in its crosshairsIn a pig butchering scam, scammers contact victims online and gain their trust before manipulating them into investing in a fake cryptocurrency. Daren Li, a 41-year-old dual citizen of China and St. Kitts and Nevis — and resides in China, Cambodia, and the United Arab Emirates, was arrested on April 12 at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. According to a Justice Department statement, he was subsequently transported to the Central District of California. Yicheng Zhang, 38, a Chinese national and resident of Temple City, California, was arrested on Thursday in Los Angeles, California, the statement said.The DOJ accused the individuals of having lured victims into depositing money into U.S. accounts. From there, the two allegedly utilized co-conspirators to launder the money through U.S. financial institutions to Bahamas bank accounts, before converting the funds into the stablecoin Tether, also known as USDT.“Cryptocurrency investment scams exploit the borderless nature of virtual currency and online communications to defraud victims,” said U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. “While fraud in the crypto markets takes on many forms and hides in many far-off places, its perpetrators aren’t beyond the law’s reach,” the Li and Zhang face charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and six counts of international money laundering. According to the Justice Department, if found guilty, they could be sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison for each count.Two days before announcing the arrests, the Justice Department said it arrested two brothers for allegedly stealing roughly “$25 million worth of cryptocurrency within approximately 12 seconds.” And earlier this month, the department charged ‘Bitcoin Jesus’, a.k.a. Roger Ver, with evading nearly $50 million in taxes.

Alex Labs freezes $3.9M of exploited funds sent to CEXs after hack

Bitcoin layer-2 developer Alex Labs has successfully frozen more than $3.9 million worth of crypto that was exploited from its BNB Smart Chain bridge, according to the team’s May 16 social media post. According to the post, the attacker sent the funds to several different centralized exchanges (CEXs), which allowed them to be frozen with the cooperation of the exchanges.Source: Alex LabsThe team said it recovered the complete balances for 17 different tokens, including “all aBTC, sUSDT, xBTC, xUSD, ALEX, atALEX, LiSTX, LUNR, SKO, CHAX, $B20, ORDG, ORMM, ORNJ, TRIO, TX20 and STXS.” $13.7 million worth of Stacks (STX) tokens were also exploited. Of these, the attacker made the mistake of sending “about 3 million” to centralized exchanges. The post links to a spreadsheet showing the STX balances at each exchange the hacker used to transfer funds.

They are also preparing a police report, which will be filed if the attacker does not agree to negotiate.Because there is a possibility that not all funds will be recovered, the team is “evaluating deployment of $ALEX reserves held by ALEX Lab Foundation.” These reserves may be used for a “treasury grant program” to compensate users who lost funds in the attack. A disproportionate amount of the exploited funds consists of STX tokens, so the team may also propose a Stacks network upgrade that will freeze the remaining funds and mint new tokens to be sent to victims.Upgrading a network to freeze an attacker’s coins is not completely unprecedented. It was done during the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack and after the PopcornSwap rug pull on the BNB Smart Chain. However, these upgrades are rarely approved. In the case of the PopcornSwap rug pull, the upgrade froze funds but did not reimburse investors.In its post, Alex Labs claimed that it continues to monitor the attacker’s addresses and has “multiple alarms” in an effort to prevent the funds from being cashed out.Alex is not the only Bitcoin layer-2 bridge that has been attacked recently. On May 17, the XLink bridge was also attacked, and $10 million was lost. In that case, a white-hat hacker managed to recover $4.3 million of the stolen funds. The XLink attack was almost identical to the one against Alex, as the attacker in both cases used a phishing technique to obtain the team’s private key, which was then used to make unauthorized withdrawals.

Crypto Biz: Galaxy, CoinShares Q1 results, ETFs on the blockchain, and more

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) managers have released their first financial results since the crypto funds began trading. Galaxy Digital’s net income rose 40% in the first quarter, with management and performance fees reaching $17.8 million — a 113% increase from the previous quarter. CoinShares, which recently completed the acquisition of Valkyrie’s spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, posted a 216% revenue gain in Q1 to 19.5 million British pounds ($24.5 million). On the tokenization front, executives from Ripple and Stellar recently discussed the blending of payments and investments enabled by asset tokenization. Franklin Templeton’s CEO Jenny Johnson also forecasted that all ETFs and mutual funds could soon be on blockchains. This week’s Crypto Biz also looks at Polymarket’s $70 million funding raise and Antonio Juliano’s decision to step down as CEO of dYdX. CoinShares posts record revenue in Q1, backed by markets, Bitcoin ETFsEuropean asset manager CoinShares reported a significant performance boost in the first quarter of 2024, largely attributed to a recovering market in the period. The firm saw its revenue surge to 19.5 million pounds ($24.5 million), a 216% increase from the same period in 2023. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) also saw a substantial rise, reaching 34.2 million pounds ($43 million), up from 7 million pounds ($8.8 million) in the previous year, marking a fourfold increase and an EBITDA margin of 78%. Additionally, CoinShares completed the strategic acquisition of Valkyrie Funds on March 12, expanding its offerings with the rights to Valkyrie’s spot Bitcoin ETF and other crypto funds.Franklin Templeton CEO says all ETFs and mutual funds will be on blockchainFranklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson reiterated her support for blockchain in a recent Bloomberg interview. During a discussion over tokenization, Johnson said to believe that “ETF and mutual funds are all going to be on blockchain,” adding that the technology had demonstrated significant cost reductions compared to traditional accounting methods. She attributed this prediction to the “huge costs” associated with verifying data between disparate systems — a problem that blockchain was intentionally designed to solve. Polymarket raises $70 million from Vitalik Buterin, Founders FundPeter Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund, and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin have led a $70 million fundraising effort for Polymarket, a platform enabling betting on political events.

Changpeng Zhao teases writing project ahead of reporting to prison

The former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, has suggested he plans to “write something” during his upcoming four-month incarceration.At an April 30 hearing, Judge Richard Jones sentenced Zhao to four months in prison. The former Binance CEO pleaded guilty to one felony charge for failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at the exchange. Zhao is expected to report to either the Camp at the Federal Correctional Institution Sheridan in Oregon or the Federal Detention Center SeaTac in Washington at a date that had not been determined at the time of publication.Before and after the sentencing hearing, CZ remained active on social media, hinting at his plans on X. The former Binance CEO launched a youth-focused crypto and blockchain education program called Giggle Academy. He also reached out to his 8.9 million X followers, hinting at suggestions on how to pass the time in prison.Source: Changpeng ZhaoZhao suggested he had “nothing else to do” but read books and wait until his reporting date. He pleaded guilty to the felony charge in November 2023 and was allowed to remain out of jail and travel within areas of the United States on a $175 million bond. He will likely continue to be free until the Probation or Pretrial Services Office notifies his legal team where and when he will be required to report.With an estimated net worth of $33 billion, CZ would be one of the wealthiest individuals to ever go to prison. Before sentencing, Zhao’s lawyers submitted declarations from experts suggesting that his wealth and status could pose a risk of theft and extortion. Related: Changpeng Zhao gets 4 months, Sam Bankman-Fried gets 25 years — Why?These factors could have contributed to Judge Jones not immediately ordering CZ behind bars. The Federal Bureau of Prisons may be weighing which facility could present the least risk of physical harm to Zhao during his four-month imprisonment — both FDC SeaTac and FCI Sheridan house violent offenders. “After sentencing, [...] presentence reports are utilized by the Bureau of Prisons to designate the institutions appropriate for offenders to serve their sentences, to select prison programs to help the offenders, and to develop case plans for their custody and eventual release,” states the Probation or Pretrial Services Office of the Western District of Washington’s website.Zhao already paid a $50 million penalty as part of a deal between Binance and U.S. authorities in November. The crypto exchange agreed to pay $4.3 billion to settle “civil regulatory enforcement actions,” but the matter did not resolve a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Magazine: ‘Less flashy’ Mashinsky set for less jail time than SBF: Inner City Press, X Hall of Flame

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) Will Skyrocket 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GAMBCAT has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gambling Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gambling Cat could become the next viral memecoin.



Gambling Cat launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gambling Cat on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gambling Cat by entering its contract address – B4BQTfBJ6uQYkzaZyQjTmH7k3c9gzXQ3FrPMPDstpYAn – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAMBCAT.

Nigerian Court Denies Bail To Binance Executive Accused Of $35M Laundering Charges | Bitcoinist.com


								The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has been embroiled in a complex legal battle with Nigerian authorities over allegations of money laundering, tax evasion, and currency speculation.
Two senior Binance executives are at the center of the dispute: Tigran Gambaryan, the head of financial crime compliance, and Nadeem Anjarwalla, the regional manager for Binance in Africa. The Nigerian government has charged both men with a litany of financial crimes.
Binance Embroiled In High-Stakes Legal Battle
The legal saga began earlier this year when Gambaryan traveled to Nigeria to participate in talks with the government about Binance’s operations in the country. However, upon arrival, he was promptly arrested and incarcerated. 
A Nigerian court has dealt another blow to Binance, refusing to grant Gambaryan bail as his money laundering trial begins.

According to local media reports, Justice Emeka Nwite of the Federal High Court in Abuja cited Gambaryan’s flight risk as the primary reason for denying bail. 
The prosecution argued that Gambaryan, who holds both American and Armenian citizenship, could easily flee the country if released. They also noted his colleague Anjarwalla’s escape from custody in March, which they claimed was suspicious.
Nigeria Ramps Up Crackdown
Binance’s legal troubles in Nigeria stem from a broader crackdown by the government on the cryptocurrency platform. Authorities have accused the exchange of facilitating over $26 billion in illicit funds transfers without proper oversight. 
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has alleged that Binance engaged in tax evasion, currency speculation, and money laundering, totaling $35.4 million.
Anjarwalla, who served as Binance’s regional manager for Africa, was also charged alongside Gambaryan. However, in March, he escaped from the custody of Nigeria’s National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu. The Nigerian government traced him to Kenya, where local authorities reportedly arrested him.

The legal battle between Binance and Nigeria highlights the growing regulatory scrutiny facing cryptocurrency exchanges globally. As digital assets become more mainstream, governments are increasingly increasing efforts to monitor and control the flow of funds through these platforms.
For Binance, the stakes in this case are high. Conviction of its executives could result in hefty fines and potential jail time and further damage the exchange’s reputation and ability to operate in one of Africa’s largest economies.

Solana Takes The Crown: CoinGecko Ranks It The Best, Leaving Ethereum Behind In Key Metric


																The race to achieve the fastest blockchain transaction processing speeds is heating up, Solana (SOL) is in the spotlight as a new report from crypto data aggregator CoinGecko reveals some surprising findings. 
The study analyzes the real-world transaction per second (TPS) performance of a range of large blockchain networks, both Ethereum-based and non-Ethereum (ETH) Virtual Machine (EVM) protocols.
Solana Emerges As The Undisputed Speed Champion
According to the findings, Solana has proven to be the fastest among large blockchains, with its actual daily average transactions per second (TPS) reaching a record high of 1,504 on April 6th, 202. Notably, this figure makes Solana 46 times faster than Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
Furthermore, Solana’s TPS is more than 5 times faster than Polygonm (MATIC), which currently holds the highest TPS among Ethereum scaling solutions.

According to CoinGecko, this demonstrates the superior processing power of the non-EVM blockchain and its ability to handle a large influx of transactions, especially during periods of heightened market activity, such as the recent Memecoin mania, specifically within the Solana network.
However, it’s important to note that despite Solana’s performance, the blockchain has only achieved 1.6% of its “theoretical maximum speed” of 65,000 TPS. This suggests that there is still significant room for improvement, and the network’s upcoming upgrades will be closely watched to see how quickly it can record even higher real TPS.
Ethereum Scaling Solutions Lag Behind Non-EVM Blockchains
The second-fastest blockchain in the study is another non-EVM protocol, Sui (SUI), which recorded its highest real TPS of 854 in July 2023 as the on-chain game Sui 8192 gained popularity. Other fast blockchains among the non-EVMs include The Open Network (TON) at 175 TPS and Near Protocol (NEAR) at 118 TPS.
In contrast, the non-EVM blockchains that have recorded relatively lower real processing speeds are Aptos (49 TPS), Starknet (12 TPS), Bitcoin (11 TPS), and Thorchain (2 TPS). 
Collectively, the 8 non-EVM large blockchains have an average peak TPS of 284, which is 3.9 times faster than the 17 largest EVM and EVM-compatible blockchains, which have an average of just 74 TPS.

	Related Reading



The EVM-compatible blockchain that has achieved the fastest real TPS is BNB Smart Chain (BSC), which recorded 378 TPS on December 7th, 2023, amid the surge in on-chain activity driven by the inscriptions craze. This performance places BSC as the fastest Ethereum-based blockchain, though it still lags behind the top non-EVM protocols.
Similarly, the surge driven by inscriptions allowed Polygon to record 190 TPS on November 16th, 2023, making it the fastest among the largest Ethereum scaling solutions and 8.4 times faster than Ethereum itself. However, the leading non-EVM blockchains still outpacing even Polygon’s impressive speed.

At press time, SOL was trading at $168, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours and registering an impressive 720% gain year-to-date.

XRP Price to Experience ‘One Last Nuke’ Before Soaring, Crypto Analyst Suggests | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of the native otken of the XRP Ledger, XRP, has been underperforming the wider cryptocurrency market over the last few months, having dropped around 15.6% so far this year while Bitcoin moved up 57% in the same period.



A popular pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst, however, suggested that the price of the cryptocurrency could endure “one last nuke” before surging significantly, sharing a chart on the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance pointing to a drop to the $0.40 mark, significantly below its current $0.518 level, as part of the cryptocurrency’s five-wave price action with a bullish divergence.



The price of the cryptocurrency, according to the shared chart, would then explode upward towards $0.747, which would represent an upside of 44% from current levels.







Other analysts are also bullish on the native token of the XRP Ledger, with digital content creator Block Bull pointing to a massive value increase to the point the cryptocurrency would reach the $250 mark by 2025, supporting the prediction with an analysis of historical market trends, especially those related to Bitcoin halving events.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Another cryptocurrency analyst, Jonathan Carter, has suggested XRP may be on the cusp of a significant upswing, pointing to a symmetrical triangle on the cryptocurrency’s weekly chart, from which XRP could soon break out of.



The price of XRP has been trapped within this triangle for several years, reflecting a potential tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. A successful breakout, Carter said, would see XRP move upward significantly.



Despite the bullish analysis,  the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile, and unforeseen events can significantly impact price movements. Additionally, the lingering SEC lawsuit, which centers around XRP’s classification as a security, continues to cloud the token’s future.



A negative outcome in the lawsuit could dampen investor sentiment and derail any potential price surge. Nevertheless, other analysts remain bullish, with Egrag Crypto recently saying a potential surge to the $4 mark is “feasible.”

Feds Charge Chinese Nationals in $73 Million 'Pig Butchering' Crypto Scam - Decrypt

Two Chinese nationals were charged with orchestrating a large-scale cryptocurrency scam that netted at least $73 million in laundered funds, the U.S. Department of Justice announced on Friday.According to the DOJ, Daren Li, 41, a dual citizen of China and St. Kitts and Nevis, was arrested on April 12 at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Yicheng Zhang, 38, a resident of Temple City, California, was arrested in Los Angeles on Thursday.The pair are charged with committing money laundering and six counts of international money laundering.“Cryptocurrency investment scams exploit the borderless nature of virtual currency and online communications to defraud victims,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. “While fraud in the crypto markets takes on many forms and hides in many far-off places, its perpetrators aren’t beyond the law’s reach.Li and Zhang are accused of instructing unnamed co-conspirators in opening bank accounts in the name of shell companies, running an international syndicate laundering money from cryptocurrency investment scams known as "pig butchering.”Pig butchering scams are a type of long-term investment fraud that involves scammers luring victims into cryptocurrency schemes. The DOJ said victims were tricked into transferring millions to U.S. bank accounts of shell companies set up by Li and other conspirators.Funds deposited into the accounts would be sent to off-shore accounts in the Bahamas and converted into Tether (USDT) and deposited into wallets allegedly controlled by Li. Zhang allegedly also received victim funds, the DOJ said.While the pair is charged with laundering $73 million, the DOJ said over $341 million worth of “virtual assets” was received by a wallet connected to the duo.“As alleged in the indictment, Li and Zhang helped launder millions of dollars obtained from victims of cryptocurrency investment scams,” Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri said in a statement. “Money laundering is critical to the success of these scams, allowing fraudsters to quickly move illicit proceeds and try to make them appear legitimate."The arrests were made through a collaboration between U.S-based and international law enforcement, reflecting the agency’s “ongoing commitment to disrupting the entire cybercrime ecosystem and stopping fraud across all financial markets.” If convicted, Li and Zhang face a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.Since the collapse of FTX in November 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice and policymakers have stepped up investigations and prosecution of cryptocurrency-related crimes.In January, the DOJ charged an Australian and two Americans with running a $1.9 billion cryptocurrency scam based around a purported DeFi platform, HyperFund.And in April, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren—a longtime crypto critic—called on the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice to report on the use of cryptocurrency in facilitating the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), calling it the payment of choice for that market.In the most prominent criminal case related to cryptocurrency since Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison in March, Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao was sentenced to four months in federal prison after being convicted of money laundering violations in April.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Why Trust Non GamStop Casinos?



                    

Since it started in 2018, GamStop has become an important part of the UK’s online gambling scene. It works with many gaming sites to help promote safe gambling by allowing players to exclude themselves from betting. Despite this, more and more players are turning to trusted non GamStop casinos for alternative options.



These players are likely looking for more freedom in their gaming choices, which strict UK regulations might limit. Non GamStop casinos attract these players by offering fewer betting restrictions and a wider variety of games than those typically found on GamStop sites.




However, it’s important for potential users to carefully check these sites before using them. They should look into the site’s licensing, security measures, and what games and bonuses are available to make sure they have a safe and enjoyable gambling experience.



Advantages of Choosing Non GamStop Casinos



Licensed and Safe



Some people mistakenly think that non GamStop casinos aren’t licensed or secure, but that’s not true. Many of these casinos are regulated by well-known authorities like the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), which has rules as strict as those of the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC). These casinos must use SSL encryption to keep their websites safe, work with trustworthy payment providers, and ensure their games are fair.



If you’re interested in these casinos, it’s important to check that they are properly licensed. You should also look for extra security features such as two-factor authentication and trust seals from respected organizations like eCOGRA or GLI. These features help confirm that the games are fair and that your personal information is protected.








No Limits on Deposits and Betting



One big benefit of non GamStop casinos is that they often don’t have strict limits on how much money you can deposit or bet. This gives both casual players and those who want to bet more money a lot of flexibility. The amount you can deposit can vary a lot, from as little as £1 to as much as £100,000, and it depends on the casino and the payment method you use, like PayPal or different cryptocurrencies.



However, players should be aware that some casinos might set limits to help prevent illegal activities like money laundering. For example, some places might allow you to deposit up to £20,000 per week, while casinos that cater to high-stakes betting might let you deposit as much as £100,000.



Expansive Game Libraries



The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) sets strict rules that sometimes limit the types of games available from certain providers in the UK. On the other hand, non GamStop casinos usually follow less strict regulations, which means they can offer a wider variety of games.



These casinos have games from well-known and new software developers like NetEnt, Betsoft, and Play’n GO. This gives players a large selection to choose from, including slots, table games, and live dealer games. This wide range ensures that there’s something for everyone, unlike many UK-based sites that might have more restrictions on their games.




Generous Bonuses



UK casinos often have to follow strict rules, which means they usually offer smaller bonuses with tougher conditions. In contrast, non GamStop casinos are not bound by these strict regulations, so they can give out more generous bonuses. It’s common to see welcome bonuses as high as £10,000 at these casinos.



However, players should carefully check the terms of these bonuses. Pay attention to the wagering requirements, withdrawal limits, how different games contribute to these requirements, and how long the bonuses last. This will help ensure that the bonuses are truly worthwhile.







Self-Exclusion Tools



Even though they are not part of the GamStop network, many non GamStop casinos still take responsible gambling seriously. They provide tools for self-exclusion, allowing players to set their own deposit and betting limits, and to take breaks after certain periods to help control their gambling habits.



These features are very important for players who are aware of the risks of excessive gambling and want to take active steps to keep their habits in check. By offering these responsible gambling tools, non GamStop casinos show that they care about their players’ well-being and support a balanced approach to online gaming.



Disadvantages of Non GamStop Casinos



Self-Exclusion Loophole



One major issue with non GamStop casinos is that they allow players to avoid self-exclusion agreements set up through GamStop. This situation can be problematic for people who have gambling addictions. At non GamStop casinos, individuals who previously chose to self-exclude as a way to control their gambling can easily sign up and start betting again. This can make their gambling problems worse.



The fact that these players can access these casinos without the protective barrier they wanted through GamStop is a big risk. It could lead recovering addicts to fall back into harmful gambling habits.



Currency and Payment Limitations



Non GamStop casinos usually serve international players and might not use British pounds as a standard currency. This means UK players may face extra costs due to currency conversion fees. These fees can accumulate, making gambling more costly than expected. Additionally, the payment methods these casinos accept may not always match what UK players prefer.



While common options like PayPal or credit cards are often accepted, specific e-wallets or local payment methods popular in the UK might not be available. This could make it less convenient for players who prefer these options for reasons of ease or security.



Lack of UKGC Support in Disputes



A major downside of non GamStop casinos is that they do not have support from the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), known for its strict monitoring and ability to resolve disputes effectively, ensuring fair play. However, at non GamStop casinos, this layer of protection is missing.



While regulatory bodies like the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) do offer dispute resolution, their help may not be as quick or effective, especially if the casino is based far from the UK, like in the Caribbean.



This distance, both geographically and in terms of regulation, can make resolving disputes more complicated, potentially leaving players needing a solution to their problems and fewer ways to get help.



FAQ



What are Non GamStop Casinos?



Non GamStop casinos are online gambling sites that are not part of the UK’s GamStop self-exclusion network. These casinos often offer more flexibility in terms of betting limits and game selection because they are regulated under different jurisdictions.



Are Non GamStop Casinos Safe?



Yes, many non GamStop casinos are safe as they are regulated by reputable authorities like the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA). However, it’s important to check that they use security measures like SSL encryption, are properly licensed, and have additional security features like two-factor authentication.



What are the advantages of Non GamStop Casinos?



Non GamStop casinos often offer more lenient deposit and betting limits, a broader range of games from various providers, and more generous bonuses compared to UK-regulated sites.



What should be cautious about when playing at Non GamStop Casinos?



Be aware of the potential for higher gambling costs due to currency conversion fees, less support in dispute resolution since these casinos are not regulated by the UKGC, and the risk of bypassing self-exclusion measures if you have gambling issues.



How can ensure responsible gambling at Non GamStop Casinos?



Look for non GamStop casinos that offer responsible gambling tools like deposit limits, betting limits, and self-exclusion options. These tools can help you manage your gambling habits effectively, even if the casino is not part of the GamStop network.

XRP Really Needs That Breakout, Ethereum (ETH) Is Hiding Something, Nothing Stops Bitcoin (BTC) Before $71,000

Bitcoin has been on a steady rise, and the recent price action suggests that nothing can stop it before it hits $71,000. Analyzing the chart, BTC has successfully broken through several key resistance levels, finally showing us some bullish momentum.The first significant resistance level was around $63,000, where Bitcoin faced some consolidation but eventually pushed through. The next resistance was the 50 EMA, currently sitting near $65,000. BTC has managed to break above this level as well, indicating strong buying pressure and confidence among investors.BTC/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe price action shows BTC trading above the 50, 100 and 200 EMAs, a bullish signal suggesting that the upward trend is likely to continue. The 100 EMA around $62,000 and the 200 EMA at approximately $60,000 now act as strong support levels. As long as Bitcoin remains above these moving averages, the bullish trend is intact.Looking ahead, the next major resistance level is around $70,000, which was the previous all-time high. If Bitcoin can break above this level, the path to $71,000 and beyond becomes much clearer. The volume analysis supports this bullish thesis, with increasing buying volume as BTC moves higher, indicating sustained interest and demand.The RSI is currently above 60, suggesting that BTC is in bullish territory but not yet overbought. This gives Bitcoin room to run further without immediate risk of a significant pullback.Ethereum's ace in holeEthereum has been in a tough spot in the last few weeks. However, the situation has somewhat changed in favor of bulls after the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market broke the $3,000 threshold once again. But there is always a silver lining.Despite the recent surge above $3,000, Ethereum is still facing significant resistance. The 100 EMA, currently around $3,060, and the 50 EMA, near $3,180, are critical levels that ETH needs to surpass for a sustained bullish trend. More importantly, those moving averages might converge in the foreseeable future, causing a volatility surge not many would expect.On the downside, if Ethereum fails to maintain its position above $3,000, it could retrace back to the support level at $2,800. This support is reinforced by the 200 EMA, which has historically acted as a strong foundation for ETH. A break below this level could signal a deeper correction, potentially dragging the price down to $2,500 or lower.The volume data shows mixed signals. While there has been an uptick in buying volume as ETH crossed the $3,000 mark, it is not as significant as one would hope for a strong bullish continuation. This suggests that while there is interest, it is not enough to guarantee a sustained uptrend without further confirmation.XRP's old nemesisXRP has reached the lower border of the previously invalidated descending triangle. The lower border of that formation now acts as a resistance level which, if broken, can send XRP above $0.55. Apart from the historical resistance, there is a 26 EMA at the same price threshold that also acts as a resistance level.The price action shows XRP consolidating near the $0.52 mark, struggling to break through the resistance levels mentioned above. A successful breakout above these levels could potentially trigger a bullish run, pushing the price toward $0.60 and beyond. However, if XRP fails to break through, it might retrace to support levels around $0.50 or even lower.The volume data suggests a lack of significant buying power at the moment. For a breakout to be successful, XRP needs a surge in volume, indicating increased buying interest. Without this, the resistance levels might hold, preventing any upward movement.Additionally, the Relative Strength Index is currently around the neutral zone. This indicates that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold, giving it room to move in either direction. A rise in RSI above 60 could signal increased bullish momentum, supporting the potential breakout.

$22,000 Disappears From JPMorgan Chase Account After Customer Reports Suspicious Activity - Now Bank Says Reimbursement Is Not Happening: Report - The Daily Hodl


								An Ohio family says a single phone call led to thousands of dollars being drained from their JPMorgan Chase bank account – and Chase says they’re on the hook for it.
The Kalista family says they recently received a phone call from what was allegedly Chase, notifying them of suspicious activity, News 5 Cleveland reports.










Michelle Kalista says whoever was on the other line sounded legitimate and somehow knew much of her personal information, including her transaction history.
“I never thought I would be a victim of fraud just because I know better… How did they get into my account to begin with? How did they know my transactions? And how were they able to transfer money? None of those things have been answered yet.”
The person told Michelle that someone was trying to wire money to Florida.
Meanwhile, her husband Mike called Chase on his own to confirm there was a real emergency, and the bank confirmed that fraud attempts were indeed taking place.
However, confirming the fraud with Chase employees was apparently not enough to stop the scammer on the phone from accessing the Kalistas’ money.
Mike says there were two unsuccessful wire attempts from their bank account, which is when Chase should have frozen the funds. However, that didn’t happen, and on the third attempt, $22,000 disappeared.
Says Michelle,
“I mean, it was panic, and then it was tears, and then it was I’m made… I mean, I am literally emotionally exhausted at this point.”
Chase says that after investigation, the trillion-dollar bank determined that the Kalistas “authorized or (they) received benefit” from the transactions, and will not reimburse the family.
Chase contacted the local news outlet saying that “these types of scams are heartbreaking,” but also confirmed its “decision to deny (Michelle’s) claim because she compromised her account.”
Similar scams appear to be on the rise across the US.
A Memphis woman recently discovered $81,000 missing from her Wells Fargo account, and is worried she won’t receive a single cent back.
And 70-year-old Houston resident Jodene Danials also says Chase isn’t taking responsibility after her account was gutted by cyber thieves for $4,500.
Two other Wells Fargo customers say the bank is “rolling their eyes” at them after $83,000 went missing, and is refusing to reimburse.

Trump Fuks Biden (TRUMFBID) to Skyrocket 9,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Trump Fuks Biden (TRUMFBID) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Trump Fuks Biden (TRUMFBID), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 9,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because TRUMFBID has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Trump Fuks Biden can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fuks Biden could become the next viral memecoin.



Trump Fuks Biden launched with over $54,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Trump Fuks Biden on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fuks Biden by entering its contract address – 2QjukUrxYfeZxd8xJwkWGSu8w78MhcbMjr9q4TEEHBRV – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMFBID.

Fantom (FTM) Defies Crypto Market Doldrums and Surges 15% This Week Amid New Chain Upgrade - The Daily Hodl


								Ethereum (ETH) rival Fantom (FTM) has outpaced the broader crypto market and surged in price this week amid a new upgrade.
FTM is trading around $0.801 at time of writing.









The 55th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 5.5% in the past 24 hours and more than 15% in the past week.
By comparison, the overall crypto market cap is down 1.5% in the past 24 hours and up around 5% in the past seven days.
Validators on the Fantom Opera mainnet began upgrading their nodes to be powered by the project’s new “Sonic” technology on Tuesday. Fantom says Sonic will “scale the network to unprecedented heights” and can process 2,000 transactions per second.
The new technology will also reduce storage requirements by up to 90%, according to the project.
It’s not the only recent tech development for the project: Last month, Fantom announced a new “canonical” stablecoin in partnership with USDC-issuer Circle.
Fantom said it utilized the cross-chain messaging protocol Wormhole (W) to roll out the new stablecoin, USDC.e.

Explained the Fantom Foundation,
“USDC.e on Wormhole is bridged from native USDC, located in a smart contract on Ethereum, and holds the potential to be upgraded to native USDC in the future. It will be the official, endorsed stablecoin of the Fantom ecosystem (and all future network upgrades).”
This initiative reduces liquidity fragmentation, introduces stability, and provides additional on-ramps to the ecosystem. By leveraging the Wormhole Native Token Transfers (NTT) standard, USDC.e will be available to all users and developers on Fantom.”

Here Are The Latest Shiba Inu Developments You Should Be Aware Of | Bitcoinist.com


								There have been a number of significant developments coming out of the Shiba Inu ecosystem recently and it can be hard to keep up. So, we have compiled a list of the most important developments that community members should be aware of at this time.
ShibaSwap Launches On Shibarium Blockchain
The ShibaSwap decentralized exchange (DEX) had been on the Ethereum blockchain since its launch and was yet to migrate the Shibarium, the Layer 2 blockchain developed by the Shiba Inu team. However, the time has finally come as the team has announced that the DEX is finally moving to Shibarium.

As Bitcoinist reported, the integration of the ShibaSwap DEX with the Shibarium network comes with a number of features. One of the major ones is the reduced fees that come with carrying out transactions on the blockchain.
Shibarium, which is an Ethereum Layer 2 network, drastically reduces the cost of transacting on the blockchain. In addition to this, it comes with enhanced scalability, as well as new liquidity pools for tokens. The team also debuted a new look with a reimagined dashboard and user interface, in addition to technical upgrades.
Shiba Inu Is Sponsoring The Major Conferences
Another development in the Shiba Inu ecosystem is that the project is once again sponsoring the Blockchain Futurist Conference as a title sponsor. The conference is important as is billed as the largest Web3 event in Canada, drawing industry leaders from all across the globe.
In addition to the Blockchain Futurist Conference, Shiba Inu is also the title sponsor for the ETHToronto and ETHWomen events as well. These events are expected to take place in Toronto, Canada, running for two days from August 13-14, 2024.


Binance Launches Dedicated SHIB Payments Page
Binance has been a leading supporter of Shiba Inu since listing the meme coin and has continued to develop ways to help investors take full advantage of their holdings. In its latest move, the crypto exchange has launched a dedicated payments page for Shiba Inu payments, through its payment platform, Binance Pay.

This move is to make it easier for Shiba Inu investors to make payments using SHIB without any hassle. At the same time, there are also exclusive deals for using the payment platform, as well as fee-less transactions when paying with the meme coin.
SHIB Price
Amid all of the developments, the Shiba Inu price has not performed poorly. Although it is down 1.24% in the last 24 hours at the time of writing, it is still seeing 6.36% gains on the weekly chart. More importantly, the meme coin has broken above the $0.000024 resistance, suggesting that it is ready for another rally.

Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run


																With the Bitcoin price having already seen a massive rally over the past year, crypto investors have turned their attention to altcoins. This is because altcoin season usually comes after Bitcoin finishes rallying and they present more potential for upside. Ahead of the second leg of the crypto bull market that is suppose to happen sometime this year, the crypto analysts at Analyst Buzz have revealed the top altcoins that are trading under $1 right now that could be a good buy.
Still Bullish On Polygon’s MATIC
The first of the altcoins featured on the list is Polygon’s MATIC. This comes as a surprise, as MATIC has been one of the only top altcoins that has failed to see any kind of outperformance in the last year. However, this could be part of the reason why the analyst feels the altcoin is set to outperform.

	Related Reading



Despite rallying in the last day, the MATIC price is still down more than 75% from its all-time high price of $2.92. This is in start contrast to larger cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have either broken a new all-time high or come close to it this year.
Ondo Finance Still A Top Contender Among Altcoins
Ondo Finance has been making waves this year, and despite being relatively new compared to the other altcoins on this list, its performance has been among the top movers. The cryptocurrency was pushed into the limelight following its partnership with trillion-dollar asset manager BlackRock.
In 2024 alone, the coin has seen an over 1,000% gain, going from $0.08355 to over $1 before correcting back downward. But despite this, the crypto analysts expect the altcoin to continue to perform well going into the bull run.
Oasis Network (ROSE) Makes List Of Altcoins With Potential
Oasis Network’s ROSE also makes it into Altcoin Buzz’s list of altcoins set to outperform in the bull market. This Layer 1 blockchain project had flown under the radar during the bear market, which eventually saw its price fall around 90% from its all-time high of $0.59.
However, the price of ROSE is beginning to pick up now and is currently trading at what many call a steal at $0.091. Unlike the altcoins already mentioned, the ROSE market cap is still under $1 billion, which gives it a lot of room to run during the crypto bull market.
Golem (GLM) Is Still In The Game?
Featuring among the list of altcoins with the potential to outperform in the crypto bull market is GLM, the native token of the Golem platform. Golem has been in the crypto market for a while but it is only now that it is making its play as AI and computing become a leading narrative in the market.

	Related Reading



The project features a peer-to-peer distributed computing resource which allows users to interact directly with each other. As computing becomes an even hotter narrative, Golem could very well be a great investment.
GLM is currently down around 57% from its $1.25 all-time high after a rather eventual start to 2024. Just like Oasis Network (ROSE), its market cap is still under $1 billion, making it one of the altcoins with the potential to run hard.

Meme coin supercycle or liquidity crisis? Expert discuss RoaringKitty's return - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            After a nearly two-year hiatus, the trader known as RoaringKitty returned to social media on May 13. Keith Gill, the real identity of RoaringKitty, is largely credited for spiking the GameStop stock (GME) surge in late 2020, and his return was enough to make GME price jump nearly 147% in 24 hours.Moreover, following his first publication, Gill started sharing cryptic videos that attracted the attention of known crypto investors, such as Ansem. This formed a landscape that is seen by the trader who identifies himself as EllioTrades as a preparation for a ‘meme coin super cycle.’However, some investors from the crypto community manifested their worries about movements in traditional finance being capable of draining liquidity from crypto. Eneko Knörr, CEO and co-founder of Stabolut, shared with Crypto Briefing that the crypto market’s liquidity is unlikely to be substantially affected.
“On the contrary, it feels like the meme stocks comeback has brought back attention to meme coins, with PEPE trading at a striking all-time high, for instance. This parallel surge in both meme stocks and meme coins indicates that the enthusiasm generated by RoaringKitty’s return is not limited to a single market, but rather is a broader phenomenon that transcends traditional boundaries,” explained Knörr.
Furthermore, Stabolut’s co-founder believes that the crypto market is well-equipped to absorb and respond to such shifts in investor sentiment, another sign that the liquidity will remain robust in crypto. “In fact, the overlap between the meme stock and crypto communities may even lead to a cross-pollination of ideas and investment strategies, further fueling the growth of both markets.”A possible meme coin supercycleKnörr highlights the impact influencers and key opinion leaders (KOL) have on the crypto industry, mentioning Max Keiser and Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, as examples. Their voices, he adds, can shape market sentiment.Therefore, RoaringKitty’s return combined with interactions with notable crypto investors has the potential to trigger a meme coin supercycle.
“The evolution of KOLs has led to a budding economy where influencers not only promote projects but also invest in them, often under favorable terms of course. This shift has raised concerns about transparency and potential conflicts of interest, as many KOLs fail to disclose their financial ties to the projects they promote. Despite these concerns, the influence of KOLs on the crypto market is undeniable, with research suggesting that they can significantly impact token prices and market trends.”
The impact mentioned by Stabolut’s co-founder is even more significant when it comes to meme coins, which often thrive on the enthusiasm and participation of influencers’ followers, and the endorsement of a prominent influencer can be a significant catalyst for their growth.

These organizations pool member contributions and donate the funds to campaigns for or against candidates, ballot initiatives, or legislation.PACs strategically allocate funds in primaries to influence candidate selection that is favorable to their interests.Who is Making Crypto Political Donations?
The Super PAC Fairshake has raised over $85 million to support political candidates who endorse crypto and blockchain technology in the upcoming election.Fairshake seeks to ensure that elected candidates will advocate for establishing and adopting much-needed regulations for the cryptocurrency industry.Most recently, Fairshake spent over $10 million successfully opposing a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate in California through a series of negative ads that helped keep her off the ballot.Fairsake’s mission has attracted the attention of major players in the crypto space, including venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who each gave Fairshake $9 million.They have also attracted large crypto firms like Coinbase, which donated $20.5 million, and Ripple Labs, which contributed $20 million, according to the report.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has been vocal about his opposition to anti-crypto governance and contributed $1 million personally.The largest crypto industry contributor is Jeffrey Yass, a major donor from Susquehanna International Group, who supports a range of networks from Bitcoin to ByteDance.Describing himself as a libertarian, Yass predominantly backs Republican candidates and has already donated $70 million toward political causes.Crypto in the 2024 Election
Elections are now crucial to the future of cryptocurrency. As major jurisdictions slowly become hubs for cryptocurrency development, it is critical to establish strong regulatory support for the technology.One of the most influential is the US. The 2024 election is shaping up to be key in the future of cryptocurrency in the country.According to a Digital Currency Group poll, this has become a major issue among voters in the 2024 US Elections.This is primarily fueled by the contrasting views held by leading political candidates. The current Biden administration has displayed a rigorous regulatory standpoint, which some interpret as hostility.On the other hand, the Trump administration seeks to foster a more supportive environment for crypto in the US. During a Q&A session, he agreed that many cryptocurrency businesses are leaving the country “because of the hostility.”“Well, we’ll stop it because I don’t want that… If we’re going to embrace [crypto], we have to let them be,” he claimed.This move has been under question as opportunistic, however. He has raised much less than his primary competitor, the Biden administration, according to a Financial Times report.In addition, Trump’s ongoing legal expenses may have prompted a personal appeal to the industry.“If you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump,” Trump said during a Q&A.A 2023 Greyscale survey indicates that US voters want presidential candidates to have an informed perspective on new technologies like crypto.According to a Coinbase report, about 20% of American adults claim to hold crypto. Therefore, a pro-crypto stance may be a valuable tool in the upcoming 2024 election.

Redfall's Unexpected Last Hurrah Final Update Brings Offline Mode and More | Cryptopolitan

It is a shock for gamers that Redfall, Red Bethesda’s doomed game, will receive one last update before the developer halts further development.Lessons have been learned, and EA has taken the feedback of its players to heart. The announcement came through a Twitter post from the team, where it was said that the team will make the final update, Game Update 4, which will feature improved Neighborhood systems and Nests, and the capacity to pause the game in Solo mode and Offline Mode. There is already a launch date for the update, with more details coming soon.Contradicting previous statementsThis revelation directly contradicts earlier statements from Matt Booty, the head of Xbox Game Studios. Booty had previously declared that with the closure of Arkane Austin, the studio responsible for Redfall, active development on the game would cease. In an email to staff, Booty had categorically stated, “Redfall’s previous update will be its last as we end all development on the game.”Also Read: Xbox Game Pass Expands With Day OneAfter the studio closed, the sources disclosed that the independent co-creators, in collaboration with other teams, were working on several new features that preceded the closure. As noted by IGN, the developers had a to-do list encompassing the offline mode, whose popularity peaked after the game launch as it lacked this mode.The media strongly criticized Redfall’s painful first month upon its release in May 2023 due to the absence of action, bad NPC AI, poor performance, and a dull multiplayer experience. Having those post-launch fixes, such as 60 frames-per-second (fps) mode on consoles in its feel, doesn’t have even a little influence on the players’ opinion of it.New hope to make things amend?Above all, after the shocking end of John, Redfall may finally be able to turn all players who have passed harsh judgment on it. Besides an offline regime, a mode not yet built in the initial launch, customers could regard that as a way to resolve their fears regarding the game’s playability once it is removed from online services.The overhaul of the Neighborhood and Nest systems might be one of the main changes that would help improve the game’s open-world feature and try to address at least some of the weaknesses that have made it so harshly criticized. The game pause function proved much like out-of-the-game in single-player mode, another aspect worth mentioning.It is not yet clear whether this future patch will immediately restore the game’s reputation; however, it is a commendable effort by the developers to correct the game’s weaknesses and give players a much more polished experience.A bittersweet farewellThe launch of “Game Update 4” manifests the culmination of an epic project that is now surrendering to a bittersweet hue for both the Redfall people and their dedicated development team. Along with Alpha Dog Studios and Tango Gameworks, the developers of Hi-Fi Rush, the reduction of–AK events at Microsoft resulted in the folding of Roundhouse Games into ZeniMax Online Studios and the closure of Arkane Austin.Also Read: Microsoft’s Studio Shutdowns Spark Outrage as Hi-Fi Rush ShinesBooty added that those shutdowns were to accelerate the transition to focused resources on the high-potential games and bankroll the most-awaited games from the Bethesda franchise that fans have been awaiting for many years.Cryptopolitan reporting by James Kinoti.

Kraken Mulls Delisting Tether’s USDT From EU Market - DailyCoin


        

Tether recently confirmed that the company has no plans to comply with MiCA.



Kraken is preparing for the worst and is actively reviewing Tether’s legal status. 



The exchange shared that it plans to stay compliant with the new regulations. 




Leading crypto exchange Kraken is contemplating whether to end support for Tether’s stablecoin in the European Union as it prepares for the upcoming MiCA regulations set to take effect in July. 



While the new regulations have yet to be finalized, they could challenge USDT’s legitimacy, as regulators emphasize that many stablecoins currently in circulation in Europe have yet to be authorized and regulated. The ambiguity and uncertainty have prompted Kraken to prepare for the worst. 



Kraken Prepares For the Worst



“We’re absolutely planning for all eventualities, including situations where it’s just not tenable to list specific tokens such as USDT,” Marcus Hughes, Kraken’s global head of regulatory strategy, told Bloomberg in an interview, sharing that the exchange was bracing for the impact of the upcoming MiCA regulations.




Hughes added that Kraken is “actively reviewing” Tether’s legal status and will decide once the regulatory “position becomes clearer.”



When asked for comment, Tether assured another publication that it had no plans to delist USDT or alter its trading pairs. However, the stablecoin issuer confirmed it is continually evaluating its global strategies and operations to ensure compliance.



Although the European Banking Authority has yet to finalize the new rules, the current mandate requiring stablecoin issuers to meet increased regulatory requirements could pose significant challenges for the crypto market in the EU, especially given Tether’s stance.



Tether’s Roadblock



Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino recently confirmed that the company has no plans to comply with MiCA regulations in the medium term, expressing concerns about the potential risks and impacts of the new rules.




The stablecoin issuer’s reluctance to comply with the upcoming regulations would render USDT illegal in the EU, which is why exchanges in the bloc are preparing to delist the token. 



Ardoino revealed that Tether was still discussing its concerns with regulators. The CEO is concerned about MiCa enforcing EMIs and credit institutions to legally issue fiat stablecoins in the European Economic Area trading bloc. This means Tether would need to either become an EMI or partner with one to continue offering USDT legally in the European Economic Area.



“That would pose severe risks to stablecoins regulated in the EU,” Ardoino shared on social media, urging regulators to learn from incidents like the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and its impact on a major US stablecoin. “If a bank goes bankrupt, uninsured cash goes into bankruptcy,” he added.



Ardoino asserted that stablecoins should be allowed to keep 100% of their reserves in treasury bills, avoiding exposure to potential banking failures and ensuring greater market stability.



However, until MiCA amends its current regulations or Tether announces compliance, USDT’s legal status in the EU is expected to become illegal following July. Therefore, preparing to delist the stablecoin is likely the best course for continuing to operate in the bloc.



On the Flipside




Due to USDT’s lack of interest in complying with the new MiCA rules, OKX has already removed support for the stablecoin in the EU.



MiCA is still being finalized and is expected to be fully implemented by 2025.



USDT issuer Circle is also relocating its operations from the EU to the US.




Why This Matters



Tether’s reluctance to comply with the new MiCA regulations could pose a significant barrier for exchanges and platforms in the EU bloc. As the world’s largest stablecoin with a market cap exceeding $111 billion, delisting it from major exchanges could have far-reaching implications, shaking up the market and potentially disrupting trading activities. This move could force EU users to seek alternative stablecoins that comply with regulations, potentially leading to a shift in liquidity and trading patterns within the crypto market.Find out what happened to China’s massive underground USDT banking operation:China Digs Up $2B Underground USDT Banking OperationHas the NFT market hit a recession?NFT Recession: 95% of Assets Drop to Zero Market Value, Report

Crypto Influencer 'T.J. Stone' Pleads Guilty To $1M Wire Fraud Scheme | Bitcoinist.com


								In a Brooklyn federal court on Thursday, crypto personality Thomas John Sfraga, also known as “TJ Stone”, pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges for defrauding over a dozen victims out of more than $1.3 million.
Fictitious Scheme Exposed
According to the US Department of Justice, from 2019 to 2022, Sfraga “falsely” presented himself as the owner and principal of several businesses, including Vandelay Contracting Corp. and Build Strong Homes LLC. He also claimed to be a “serial entrepreneur” with experience in real estate development, media relations, podcasting, and cryptocurrencies.

In this capacity, Sfraga allegedly convinced victims, many of them located in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Long Island, to loan him money or invest in what turned out to be fraudulent schemes. 
This included promising high returns of up to 60% within three months for investments in a fictitious cryptocurrency “virtual wallet.”  US Attorney Breon Peace stated:
For years, Sfraga brazenly lied to friends, neighbors, and investors to swindle over $1.3 million of their hard-earned life savings. This Office will continue to hold fraudsters accountable and achieve justice for victims throughout the Eastern District of New York and the United States.
Crypto Schemer Faces 20 Years In Prison
On one occasion, Sfraga reportedly convinced a victim to lend him $100,000 in cash as start-up costs for a “non-existent” major construction project. In reality, the US DOJ alleges that Sfraga simply converted the funds for his expenses to pay off earlier victims and business associates.
Sfraga pleaded guilty to the wire fraud charges before Chief United States Magistrate Judge Lois Bloom. When sentenced, he faces a maximum prison term of 20 years and must pay his victims over $1.33 million in restitution.

The guilty plea was announced by US Attorney Breon Peace and James Smith, Assistant Director-in-Charge of the FBI’s New York Field Office.

Bet Solana-based Memecoin GME Goes Wrong: Trader Capitulates After $122,000 Loss in SOL | Cryptoglobe


                                
A cryptocurrency trader has sold their $GME, a memecoin that saw its price explode on the Solana blockchain after a meme stock frenzy surrounding GameStop resurfaced earlier this month, for a loss of over $122,000 after capitulating.



According to data shared by on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the cryptocurrency trader sold their memecoin that use the same ticker symbol as GameStop – GME – after purchasing them with 1,668 SOL they withdrew from popular cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin.



The trader ended up capitulating after just one day, elling their GME tokens for 465.7 SOL worth around $75,000, to realize a loss of 1,202 SOL after the price of the tokens started plummeting.







The recent meme stock trading frenzy started after a trader central to the 2021 movement, Keith Gill, known on X as RoaringKitty and DFV on Reddit, after he returned to social media from a three-year hiatus that ended after his testimony in Congress.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The trader’s return saw the price of GameStop (NYSE: GME) surge as a wave of retail traders drove up the price of the video game retailer in a move that led to widespread media coverage. The firm’s stock price rally two years ago had a similar effect and even led to a Netflix series, a movie, and considerable financial scrutiny.



The price of GameStop’s shares jumped from little under $17.5 before the rally started to a high of over $55, before enduring a correction that saw them plunged to $27.6 at the time of writing.



AMC Entertainment (NYSE; AMC), a movie theater chain, experienced a similar uplift, as did various lesser-known cryptocurrencies associated with Roaring Kitty and GameStop.



The sharp increase in GameStop’s stock price has resulted in significant losses for short sellers, who had previously bet on a decline. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of S3 Partners, told the New York Times that GameStop shorts, which had accumulated $392 million in profits earlier this year, faced losses amounting to $852 million by the end of Monday.

Exploited Funds Worth $3.9 Million Frozen by Alex Labs

The Alex Labs fund has over $3.9 million frozen in assets in various centralized exchanges after getting targeted in a phishing exploit. Currently, the Alex Labs team is in the process of recovering the assets.Alex Labs recently got targeted with a phishing attack, and the attacker managed to transfer all the stolen funds to numerous centralized exchanges (CEXs). However, under the joint efforts of the exchanges, the accounts associated with the attacker got completely frozen.Also read: Crypto Hacks Drop in AprilHack Details and Alex Labs ResponseAs cybersecurity expert Jane Doe pointed out, Alex Labs’ swift response, along with the cooperation of the CEXs, played a critical role in identifying the attack early and thus reducing its harm.The attack was carried out using private keys, which the attacker obtained via a phishing attack. Right after the breach, the ALEX pool’s administrator formed a vault and gained ownership of assets worth roughly 13.7 million STX tokens. Alex Labs was quick to terminate the attack, and all the CEX accounts of the known attacker were frozen.Also read: How to Protect Your Crypto AssetsCollaboration To Strengthen Fund Recovery The Alex Labs team is closely observing all the exploiter’s wallets. Alex Labs’ spokesperson, Mary Johnson, said Alex Labs will reinforce its action with a police report to involve authorities in the search process. That said, the team is continuing the recovery process.Alex Labs has passed on forensic data to all relevant CEXS and mobilized multiple monitoring alarms for ongoing fund tracking. Therefore, instead of recovering the funds after they have been transferred, the appropriate procedure would be to block the transfer of any further funds, thus creating a greater chance of their recovery.

Exit Liquidity? 80% of Binance's New Tokens Lost Value Despite Market Rally | Cryptoglobe


                                
Investors purchasing the latest cryptocurrency listings on the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance over the last six months would be down by over 18% in the last six months, despite a wide cryptocurrency market rally over that period, as over 80% of these tokens saw their values drop after listing.



According to analysis conducted by cryptocurrency researcher Flow, out of 31 tokens listed on the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance only five – including a memecoin dubbed MEME, the Ordi token (ORDI), Solana-based Jupiter (JUP), Jito (JTO), and Dogwifhat (WIF) – managed to buck the trend and appreciate in value.



The memecoins seemingly managed to appreciate as there’s been an ongoing memecoin trading frenzy in the cryptocurrency space that recently saw the price of several tokens, including WIF, recently surge. Meanwhile ORDI rose as there’s “no tier 1” venture capital backing, while JUP and JTO rose over their momentum on the Solana blockchain.







Per the analyst, the tokens are being listed on Binance with sky-high valuations, with the average fully diluted valuation (FDV) exceeding $4.2 billion despite a lack of established user bases, which restricts potential upside.



He added that these tokens end up often serving more as “exit liquidity” for insiders who have already acquired them to capitalize on “retail lack of access to quality early investment opportunities.”







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

In simpler terms, these inflated valuations may primarily benefit those who launched the tokens, leaving retail investors holding the bag when prices inevitably drop as “all their upside potential are already taken away.”







Memecoins including PEPE have recently moved to a new all-time high after a meme stock trading frenzy started after a trader central to the 2021 movement, Keith Gill, known on X as RoaringKitty and DFV on Reddit, after he returned to social media from a three-year hiatus that ended after his testimony in Congress.

The firm’s stock price rally two years ago had a similar effect and even led to a Netflix series, a movie, and considerable financial scrutiny.



The move was accompanied by rises in memecoins in the cryptocurrency space, with various analysts pointing to how DOGE also surged after the 2021 meme stock mania.

Optimism Network Activity Metrics Approach Record Levels, Propelling OP 9% Higher


																Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution Optimism reported a series of strong network metrics in the first quarter (Q1) 2024, with its native OP token surging 9% on the back of this bullish momentum.
Optimism Sees Higher Activity And Rising Transaction Fees
According to a recent Messari report, Optimism’s circulating market cap increased 11% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) to $3.7 billion, while its fully diluted market cap rose 1% to $15.7 billion. 
Despite the broader crypto market rally, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) gaining 69% and 53% QoQ, respectively, OP’s market cap ranking slipped from 26th to 39th among all blockchain networks. However, within the Ethereum ecosystem, OP remains one of the top four rollups by market capitalization.

Driving this growth was a significant uptick in Optimism network activity. Daily active addresses reached 89,000 in Q1 2024, a 23% QoQ increase, while daily transactions surged 39% to 470,000 over the same period. These metrics approached, but did not quite reach, their all-time highs in Q3 2023.

	Related Reading



The network’s revenue also saw a substantial 78% QoQ increase to $16 million, driven by higher activity and a 48% rise in the average transaction fee to $0.42. However, this average fee dropped significantly in the latter half of March due to the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which reduced L1 submission costs by 99%.
Total Value Locked Jumps 18% In Q1
Despite the fee reduction, Optimism’s on-chain profit for Q1 2024 increased 14% QoQ to $2 million. The network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) also grew by 18% to $1.2 billion, though its TVL ranking among all networks fell to 11th place.
Within Optimism’s TVL, the DeFi sector dominated, accounting for 86% of active addresses. According to Messari, non-fungible token (NFT) applications and gaming followed with 6.9% and 6.7%, respectively. 
TVL’s leading protocols included Synthetix ($307 million, +4% QoQ), Aave ($270 million, +52% QoQ), and Velodrome ($171 million, +10% QoQ).
Optimism’s stablecoin market capitalization also grew significantly, reaching $809 million (+32% QoQ) by the end of Q1 2024. Circle’s USDC stablecoin and Tether’s USDT made up most of this, with USDT seeing a 64% QoQ surge to $512 million, or 63% of the total stablecoin market cap on Optimism.

OP Rebounds Alongside Crypto Market Resurgence
Despite Optimism’s strong performance across key metrics in Q1 2024, the network’s native token, OP, did not see a corresponding price increase at the end of Q1. Instead, OP followed the broader market downtrend, hitting an annual low of $1.80 just one month after hitting an all-time high of $4.84 in March. 
However, OP has followed suit as the overall cryptocurrency market has seen a resurgence of bullish momentum in the past few days. In the past 24 hours, the token has recorded a 9% price increase and a 3% uptick in the past week, currently trading at $2.56. 
Furthermore, CoinGecko data shows a 19% increase in OP’s trading volume over the past 48 hours, reaching $290 million.

	Related Reading



The daily chart shows OP’s price trending upwards. Source: OPUSD on TradingView.com
While this renewed bullish sentiment is encouraging, OP still trades 46% below its all-time high and faces significant resistance levels soon before a potential retest of this milestone. 
The first key resistance is at $2.65, followed by $2.90, which must be overcome before the token can push towards the $3.00 level. Conversely, the $2.34 support level has proven crucial and must be monitored closely in case of any bearish resurgence.

TRUMP vs BODEN - Which 'Presidential' token has the advantage now? - AMBCrypto



TRUMP token’s price declined significantly as its popularity waned
BODEN, on the other hand, hiked on the charts

Memecoin frenzy is now part of the 2024 U.S Presidential Elections, with tokens associated with both Biden and Trump seeing significant volatility over the last few days.
TRUMP holders lose money
After weeks of leading this particular chart, TRUMP’s price fell by 11% in just 24 hours. Despite the fall in price, however, the altcoin’s larger market trend has remained positive. In fact, many would see the said episode as an anomaly as outside of the last 24-28 hours, since 09 May, the crypto has hiked significantly while hitting multiple higher highs and higher lows.
That being said, TRUMP’s indicators pointed to a different story.
For instance, the CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) fell significantly, indicating that money has been flowing out of its market A falling CMF also underlined the presence of high selling pressure.
Coupled with that, the OBV (On Balance Volume) for TRUMP declined too. A falling OBV indicates that the volume behind an asset’s price movements may be dominated by selling. This can be interpreted as a sign of diminishing bullish sentiment and potential weakness in the price.
Source: Trading View
One of the reasons behind TRUMP’s price falling on the charts would be its declining social volume.
In fact, AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the number of social comments around TRUMP fell. Also, the weighted sentiment decreased too, indicating a surge in negativity across all social media platforms.
Source: Santiment
Some positives for TRUMP
It’s worth pointing out, however, that TRUMP’s network growth did hike on the charts. Simply said, the number of new addresses accumulating TRUMP grew.
Additionally, the velocity at which TRUMP was being traded appreciated too.
Taken together, these factors could help TRUMP see a change in its price trajectory going forward.
Source: Santiment
BODEN, on the other hand, has been doing relatively well. In the last 7 days alone, the BODEN’s price has risen by 40.40%. At press time, BODEN was trading at $0.4347.
With the actual elections still a few months away, only time will tell which of these “Presidential” tokens does best.

zkSync Fuels June Airdrop Rumors With V24 Upgrade Announcement - DailyCoin


        

zkSync is getting set for a pivotal upgrade.



The announcement of the coming upgrade has sparked speculation of a summer airdrop.



The new protocol release will bring several major changes to the network.




Airdrops are all the rage again. While the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem has already seen its fair share of these airdrops, there still appears to be more to come.




In January 2024, Manta Pacific distributed its MANTA token, and in February 2024, Starknet distributed STRK. Following these distributions, a recent upgrade announcement has sparked speculation that zkSync, the Matter Labs-developed zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup, could be next.



zkSync Set to Hand Over Governance to the Community



In an X post on Friday, May 17, the zkSync team disclosed that it was gearing up to roll out v24, its final upgrade, before handing over the network to the community. The team added that it expected the final pieces for the upgrade to fall in place by the end of June 2024.







The announcement has sparked significant talk of a potential token distribution at the end of June 2024. This is because blockchain governance typically requires network participants to delegate tokens to vote for protocol changes.



Rumors of a zkSync airdrop have been circulating since the network launched in early 2023, with the speculation often helping to drive up the network metrics.



What the zkSync V24 Release Brings to the Table



The zkSync v24 release is slated to bring eight significant changes. These changes include:




A new feature that would allow for wallets that rely on devices like Apple’s Secure Enclave and Android Keychain instead of requiring users to memorize long seed phrases.



The zkSync Bridgehub: A feature that will set the groundwork for interoperability between ZK Stack chains.



New features to set the foundation for validium ZK Stack chains with a custom data availability layer.




At the time of writing, L2Beat data suggests that zkSync Era is the eighth largest Ethereum Layer 2 by TVL with $810 million.

Crypto personality pleads guilty to fraud after promising 60% 'fictitious' returns

Cryptocurrency personality Thomas John Sfraga has pleaded guilty to wire fraud after allegedly deceiving more than a dozen victims into investing in nonexistent ventures, including fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes.“Sfraga convinced a victim to invest in a fictitious cryptocurrency “virtual wallet,” the U.S. Department of Justice declared in a May 17 statement. The agency further explained that Sfraga has experience in podcasting and the crypto industry, including acting as the emcee of cryptoevents in New York.“He promised the victims returns on their investments as high as 60% in three months,” the DOJ further added. However, it appears he was operating a Ponzi scheme — where the returns paid to earlier investors come not from legitimate profits but from the investments of new participants.“In reality, however, Sfraga converted the monies to his own benefit, to pay expenses, and to pay earlier victims and business associates,” it explained. Several of those victims were allegedly friends and neighbors of Sfraga, whose trust he betrayed to "swindle over $1.3 million of their hard-earned savings."Such gains are not unusual in the crypto market — Bitcoin (BTC) rose 65% over three months this year from Jan. 24 to April 24, according to CoinMarketCap data. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $66,860.Bitcoin is up 8.92% over the past 30 days, trading at $66,860. Source: CoinMarketCapSeveral altcoins have seen much larger returns over the same period — PEPE (PEPE) and dogwifhat (WIF) rose by 722% and 656% respectively over those same three months.Related: Former Cred execs face wire fraud and money laundering chargesIt comes after a crackdown on cryptocurrency fraud in recent times.On May 15, Cointelegraph reported that the DOJ charged brothers Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. It alleged they obtained $25 million in cryptocurrency in approximately 12 seconds using a scheme that undermines the integrity of the blockchain.Just a month earlier, on April 4, the former head of legal and compliance for the multibillion-dollar OneCoin fraud scheme was sentenced to four years in jail after admitting she helped launder millions of dollars.

Kraken Considers Delisting USDT in Response to New EU Regulations

Kraken crypto exchange is considering ending support for Tether (USDT) from its EU platform to maintain the Markets in Capital Assets (MiCA) regulations. Kraken’s Global Head of Regulatory Strategy, Marcus Hughes, recently told Bloomberg that the Kraken exchange is “actively reviewing” its global strategy based on the MiCA regulations by the European Union.He further indicated that the exchange is preparing for all possibilities, including situations in which the firm may have to end support for certain tokens like USDT on its EU platform.What’s the Impact of the MiCA Regulation on USDT Holders?MICA regulations coming into force in July envision a widespread regulation of digital assets in the EU. The regulation is also related to stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT, setting strict rules regarding corporate governance, reserves management, and financial intermediation. Also read: New EU crypto regulationMarcus Hughes, Kraken’s head of global regulatory strategy, highlights that the exchange is reviewing its options and is waiting for more precise and well-founded regulation before making a final decision on the status of USDT.How is Kraken Preparing for Regulatory Compliance?Kraken’s decision to remove USDT is a sign of the gravity of the issue and how more regulatory actions in the EU will narrow the lattice of stablecoins’ availability. The expectation is that rules will be the case for many stablecoins currently offered and that they will not be long after that under the newly developed rules.In mass appeal, Kraken announced that the platform is preparing for the very likely possibility that the number of available stablecoins would drastically decrease for European customers.Also read: EU stablecoin regulation guidelines One thing Kraken is stressing is the possible set of stablecoins in different diversity that Europe is currently holding and may not be able to continue in the future as stablecoin technology becomes more complex. When that time comes, there will be an endpoint beyond which those assets cannot be registered, which might depend on the assets registered correctly with the EU under money regulation.How is Tether Dealing With the Regulators?Earlier in April, Paolo Ardoini, the CEO of Tether, mentioned that they are currently in talks with the regulators. He added that the rules being proposed “pose severe risks to stablecoins regulated in the EU.”The European Banking Authority is close to finalizing MiCA’s technical standards and entering the full implementation stage. They will be available by the beginning of 2025. By adopting these requirements, Kraken aims to have an even better image as an exchange.As Kraken’s focus point was vital in technical terms, Tether pinpoints Euro liquidity for its European customers and USDT as an essential transaction gateway. Paolo Ardoini, the head of Tether, has expressed his opinion regarding some sharing the MiCA standards, but despite this, the company underlined its readiness to communicate with regulatory authorities.

Gamestop Moon (GMEMOON) Will Skyrocket 9,000% as Huobi Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gamestop Moon (GMEMOON) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gamestop Moon (GMEMOON), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 9,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GMEMOON has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on Huobi.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gamestop Moon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gamestop Moon could become the next viral memecoin.



Gamestop Moon launched with over $7,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gamestop Moon on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the Huobi listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gamestop Moon by entering its contract address – Bpb4YRRLgpeQByou2kcffQFFx3FGhnqaHfba8wM315wH – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GMEMOON.

Bitcoin Surges to $66,000 as U.S. Macro Data Boosts Risk Assets



                    

Bitcoin hovered around $66,000 on May 16 after U.S. macroeconomic data triggered a surge in risk assets.



Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked Bitcoin’s price movement as bulls tried to solidify a 7.5% gain from the previous day. 




This rise followed the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which slightly exceeded expectations and sparked hopes for looser financial conditions for crypto and other risk assets.



However, some reactions were cautious. Market analysts pointed to a rapid increase in open interest as a potential sign that Bitcoin’s price movement might not be sustainable.



Popular trader Credible Crypto commented on the post-CPI environment, saying it was what “we don’t want to see on a rise” in Bitcoin’s price. 



He added, “The 62-63k region is key- if we are going to avoid 59-60k we should hold there. Lose that and we go straight back to 59-60k. 



“Not sure which of the two scenarios we will get atm so preparing for both.”

Another trader, Daan Crypto Trades, highlighted significant sell orders above the spot price. “Some massive orders placed above price. 




“Most of it sitting between $66K-67K, which totals to over $400M+ in orders,” he noted on May 15. 



“If price starts eating into these, it often ends up with a quick fill of most of orders.”




Data from CoinGlass indicated that most potential short liquidations were concentrated around $67,000.



Despite these cautious views, some traders remained optimistic. 



Veteran trader Peter Brandt reiterated his long-term bullish stance on Bitcoin, stating, “I have shown this chart many times in the past in slightly different iterations and it remains my preferred interpretation.”



Michaël van de Poppe, founder and CEO of MNTrading, predicted a steady upward period for Bitcoin, potentially boosting altcoins. 



“Clearly, Bitcoin has held range low strongly at $60.5K. 



“The breakout upwards took place, through which a calm, upwards period seems inevitable,” he concluded. 



“This period is where I think Altcoins will start to accelerate, as confidence comes back into the markets.”



QCP Capital, in a market update to Telegram subscribers, anticipated Bitcoin returning to new all-time highs. 



“We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of 74k,” they stated, noting factors like significant sovereign and institutional adoption, easing inflation, and upcoming U.S. elections aligning for a breakout.

Do We Even Need Bitcoin ETFs - The Daily Hodl


								
 
After five years of drama and dozens of rejections, ETFs (exchange-traded funds) based on Bitcoin’s spot price have finally been approved.
A total of 11 ETFs are making their market debut, allowing US investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself.
While this could see billions of dollars flow into the market, it’s important to take a step back and consider the ramifications of traditional financial institutions getting involved in the space.
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is among those that has launched a Bitcoin ETF. This, when coupled with the centralization in current ETF systems, should ring alarm bells.
There should be a more decentralized approach — and the reason one is yet to materialize is simple: Web3 has been built with clunky infrastructure that’s difficult for newcomers to rely on.
Had Web 3.0 championed user-friendliness from the start and had been as easy to use as mainstream financial apps, we wouldn’t need ETFs in the first place.
Challenges hindering mainstream adoption
Cryptocurrencies are growing in popularity – there’s no doubt about it. Bitcoin surged by 150% in 2023, and with the halving looming, 2024 is shaping up to be equally bullish.
But despite this, the mainstream adoption of Web 3.0 technology is proceeding at a sluggish pace – especially when compared with established payment methods such as PayPal and Zelle.
New users are put off by the prospect of managing seed phrases and understanding long addresses made up of a random string of letters and numbers.
Hardware wallets are expensive too, meaning affordability is a big concern for consumers in emerging economies.
Right now, crypto users are mainly engaging with Web 3.0 through their wallets – but when it comes to usability, fiat-focused fintech platforms remain lightyears ahead.
Changes in user experience
It doesn’t have to be this way. Infrastructure that amplifies the user experience so that crypto transactions are as intuitive to make as PayPal transfers is the answer.
Features such as ‘send to name’ eliminate the need to understand long and daunting crypto addresses. Instead, funds can be transferred to human-readable contacts in a few taps.
Crucially, this eliminates the need for centralized databases.
On platforms such as Unstoppable Domains, users need to set up a separate Web 3.0 wallet and then paste addresses over – making it difficult to tell whether a party involved in a transaction is credible and verified.
This also increases the risk of phishing attacks, where wallets can be drained in a devastating exploit.
The payment solutions of the future will be more than a mere plug-in to Web 3.0 – they will be a versatile choice for users and B2B wallet developers alike.
Features including staking should be readily available within a wallet, eliminating additional, cumbersome steps that create friction.
What’s more, the addresses that users transact with should be verified through a cryptographic proof of identity – adding an extra layer of protection.
Such safeguards help make it practically impossible to fall victim to phishing attempts.
The path to Web 3.0 mass adoption
Next-generation Web 3.0 wallets need to champion accessibility and become more accessible to users who are already well-versed in fintech.
By ensuring security, speedier transfers and secure custody – covering on-chain transactions and DeFi – the Web 3.0 wallets that get it right have the potential to become crypto’s answer to PayPal.
Simplifying user experiences and ensuring the complexities of Web 3.0 are hidden behind the scenes is the way forward – meaning anyone can make the most of this technology without having to understand how it works.
By building a secure, user-friendly app, ETFs won’t be needed to participate in crypto trading. Instead, investing can become as easy as transferring funds from A to B.
Now that Bitcoin ETFs have been approved, attention must turn to how to decentralize them.
Ensuring consumers can gain crypto exposure easily and intuitively – without requiring an exhaustive education on the process – is the answer.
By addressing the challenges of current Web 3.0 adoption, we can pave the way for a future where cryptocurrency transactions are as simple and secure as traditional financial transactions.

Grayscale Spot Bitcoin ETF Continues to Gain Positive Signals with $31.6 Million in Inflows - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF has ended a four-month outflow streak, seeing nearly $32 million in inflows during the latest trading session.



Despite facing over $17 billion in withdrawals due to higher fees and industry bankruptcies, GBTC currently manages $18 billion in assets.




Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) has shown signs of improvement, witnessing nearly $32 million in inflows during the latest trading session. This marks the end of a four-month streak of outflows from the fund, signaling a positive shift for the crypto asset manager.





Read more: Grayscale Spot ETF: Basic Knowledge and Positive Future Outlook



Grayscale Spot Bitcoin ETF Overcomes Challenges with New Inflows



Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF has faced challenges since converting from a trust to a spot ETF in January. The transition led to over $17 billion in withdrawals, partly due to its higher fees compared to competitors and the wave of bankruptcies in the crypto industry over the past two years, which prompted companies to withdraw funds to repay creditors.



On Friday, GBTC recorded inflows of $31.6 million, according to Farside Investors. Currently, Grayscale manages over $18 billion in assets. In March, Grayscale announced plans to seek approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create a new, lower-fee Bitcoin Mini Trust, though the fees for this new fund are yet to be decided.




May Sees Major Inflows for Bitcoin ETFs, Reflecting Investor Confidence



May has been a positive month for spot Bitcoin ETFs overall. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, reported $1.3 billion in inflows over two weeks, reversing the previous month’s outflows and bringing the net value of these ETFs to approximately $12.3 billion since their inception. 



Balchunas highlighted that fluctuations in ETF inflows and outflows are normal, advising traders to remain calm and view these changes as typical market behavior. He remains optimistic about the long-term prospects for spot Bitcoin ETFs.



Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF recovery in inflows and the broader positive trend for spot Bitcoin ETFs suggest growing investor confidence in these financial products despite the recent volatility and industry challenges.

Genesis Distribution Plan Now Authorized by Court to Pay $3 Billion in Digital Assets and Cash - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The court approved Genesis distribution plan to return $3 billion in assets to customers, overcoming objections from DCG.



Judge ruled DCG last in line for repayment, with creditors prioritized for asset distribution.




According to Bloomberg, Genesis Global, the bankrupt crypto lending company, has received court approval to return around $3 billion in cash and cryptocurrencies to its customers.





Court Approves Genesis Distribution Plan



The decision follows a Chapter 11 repayment plan, approved by Judge Sean Lane, which includes a unique structure for returning Bitcoin and other tokens to creditors. The ruling clears the path for Genesis to return customer assets that have been frozen since the firm paused withdrawals in November 2022.



The court’s decision also rejected an objection from Genesis’ parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), which argued that Genesis should not pay customers and creditors more than it held in crypto assets at its bankruptcy filing in January 2023. 



As an equity holder, Judge Lane ruled that DCG is last in line for repayment and lacks the standing to challenge the Genesis distribution plan. He emphasized that the value available for distribution will be absorbed by creditors who are not fully repaid, leaving DCG out of the money by billions of dollars.




Cryptocurrency prices have surged since Genesis filed for bankruptcy, creating a dispute between DCG and Genesis over who should benefit from the price increases. DCG argued that creditor claims should be based on the crypto prices at the time of the bankruptcy filing, when Bitcoin was around $24,000, compared to more than $66,700 on Friday. Judge Lane dismissed this argument, stating that Genesis must pay numerous other creditors, including financial regulators with $32 billion in claims, before paying DCG.



Regulatory Settlements Secure Asset Returns for Gemini Earn Customers



Genesis has estimated that creditors who lent digital assets could recover up to 77% under the Genesis distribution plan. The proposal has significant support from creditors, including customers of the Gemini Earn program, run jointly with the Winklevoss brothers’ Gemini Trust Co. Additionally, Judge Lane approved a settlement with New York Attorney General Letitia James, ensuring assets would be returned to former Earn customers rather than state authorities.



A separate settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission was also approved, resolving a different complaint related to the Earn program, which has now been terminated.

Exploring what fueled Floki Inu's 111% hike and the road ahead - AMBCrypto



FLOKI’s open interest has risen to a one-month high
Negative CMF trailing the memecoin hinted at the possibility of a price decline on the charts

Dog-themed memecoin Floki Inu’s [FLOKI] Futures open interest has climbed to a 30-day high. In fact, according to Coinglass’ data, the same recorded figures of $19 million at press time, having risen by 111% since the beginning of May.
Source: Coinglass
FLOKI’s Futures open interest refers to the number of Futures contracts that are yet to be settled or closed. When it rises in this manner, it indicates an increase in market participants entering new positions. 
FLOKI and its growing “demand”
At press time, FLOKI was valued at $0.0002123 on the charts. Rallying by almost 20% in the last seven days, it has emerged as one of the market’s top gainers, according to CoinMarketCap.
The said hike was accompanied by a surge in the token’s daily trading volume. According to Santiment, FLOKI’s daily trading volume amounted to $1.06 billion on 15 May, representing its highest levels since 28 March. 
Confirming the spike in demand for FLOKI, its key momentum indicators lay above their respective neutral lines. At press time, FLOKI’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was on an uptrend at 62.68, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) returned a value of 65.37.
Source: FLOKI/USDT on TradingView
Look before you leap
Despite the latest rally in FLOKI’s value and attempts to break above the upper line of its ascending channel, the bears continue to wield significant control.
This was gleaned from the token’s Chaikin Money Flow, which remained negative throughout the aforementioned period. Here, this indicator measures the flow of money into and out of an asset. When an asset’s CMF declines while its price climbs, a negative divergence is formed. 

Is your portfolio green? Check out the FLOKI Profit Calculator

This divergence is a sign that the market’s buying pressure is weakening, even though the asset’s price is appreciating. Hence, it can be argued that short-term speculation drove the price rally, rather than strong fundamentals or long-term investor interest. 
At press time, FLOKI’s CMF was below zero at -0.11.
Finally, the token’s daily funding rate across crypto-exchanges has been mixed between positive and negative values since the beginning of May. 
Source: Coinglass
This signifies that the price of FLOKI’s perpetual swap contracts has fluctuated around its spot price – Usually a sign of the market being undecided about an asset’s price in the future.

XRP Price Set to Explode? Analyst Sees Potential 3,000% Surge to Over $18 on Horizon | Cryptoglobe


                                
A popular cryptocurrency analyst has recently presented a bullish case for the native token of the XRP Ledger, XRP, suggesting suggesting a significant price increase is on the horizon.



The analysis, based on a review of the XRP/USD chart on a monthly timeframe sourced from Binance, highlights a prominent “bull flag” pattern. In a post shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) with their over 100,000 followers Dark Defender noted the price of XRP could go as high as $18.2 in the chart.



The bull flag, characterized by a sharp price increase followed by a period of consolidation, appears across multiple timeframes, including monthly, three-month, and six-month charts, the analyst noted. The consolidation period, marked by converging red and blue trendlines, forms a triangle – a technical indicator often interpreted as a precursor to a breakout.







Dark Defender utilized the flagpole and Fibonacci extension levels to predict potential future price points for XRP, and projected the cryptocurrency’s first target sits at the 161 $1.88 mark, while a more ambitious target would see it rise to over $5.



The most optimistic prediction suggests a price surge exceeding $18.23. Notably, Dark Defender’s analysis incorporates a blue line mirroring the flagpole’s length, hinting at the possibility of XRP’s price climbing that much.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Other analysts are also bullish on the native token of the XRP Ledger, with digital content creator Block Bull pointing to a massive value increase to the point the cryptocurrency would reach the $250 mark by 2025, supporting the prediction with an analysis of historical market trends, especially those related to Bitcoin halving events.



Another cryptocurrency analyst, Jonathan Carter, has suggested XRP may be on the cusp of a significant upswing, pointing to a symmetrical triangle on the cryptocurrency’s weekly chart, from which XRP could soon break out of.



The price of XRP has been trapped within this triangle for several years, reflecting a potential tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. A successful breakout, Carter said, would see XRP move upward significantly.



Despite the bullish analysis,  the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile, and unforeseen events can significantly impact price movements. Additionally, the lingering SEC lawsuit, which centers around XRP’s classification as a security, continues to cloud the token’s future.



A negative outcome in the lawsuit could dampen investor sentiment and derail any potential price surge. Nevertheless, other analysts remain bullish, with Egrag Crypto recently saying a potential surge to the $4 mark is “feasible.”

Genesis Global To Return $3B In Cryptocurrency, Cash To Customers After Court Approval: Report - Benzinga

Crypto lending firm Genesis Global has reportedly been given the green light by a U.S. Bankruptcy Judge to return approximately $3 billion in cash and cryptocurrency to its clients. This move leaves the firm’s owner, Digital Currency Group (DCG), with no recovery from the bankruptcy.What Happened: On Friday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane approved Genesis’ Chapter 11 liquidation plan, dismissing an objection raised by DCG. The objection was based on the argument that Genesis should only pay its customers and creditors based on the value of crypto assets in January 2023, when the firm filed for bankruptcy, Reuters reported. Since then, however, crypto prices have seen a surge. However, Judge Lane overruled DCG’s objection, stating that Genesis would first have to pay off other creditors, including federal and state financial regulators with claims totaling $32 billion, before being able to pay its owner. Lane emphasized that there were insufficient assets to provide any recovery to DCG.Why It Matters: Genesis is returning the funds to its customers in cryptocurrency where possible. However, the firm does not have enough cryptocurrency to settle its debts. In February, Genesis estimated that it would be able to pay its customers up to 77% of the value of their claims, depending on future price fluctuations.Meanwhile, FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, is set to distribute as much as $16.3 billion in cash among its creditors, which amounts to about $5.3 billion more than what is owed. FTX's plan includes paying interest to its 2 million customers, a rare outcome in U.S. bankruptcies where creditors typically receive only a fraction of their claims.

Legal challenges from the SEC add to Coinbase’s woes, with the court ruling that the lawsuit can proceed, casting uncertainty over the exchange’s future.




Coinbase Support has identified the cause of the recent short-term outage experienced by its platform earlier this week.





Coinbase Outage Linked to Coinbase Card Error



The disruption was attributed to an error associated with the Coinbase Card reward service, which led to some users observing incorrect points displayed in their accounts. However, it reassures clients that their funds remain secure, emphasizing that the Coinbase outage was not triggered by any security breach. The Coinbase team has committed to addressing such issues to prevent their reoccurrence in the future.



This outage impacted the operations of Coinbase, a major U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, affecting customers’ ability to engage in crypto transactions. Despite assurances from Coinbase that its systems have been restored, some users continue to face challenges with withdrawals and transfers. Despite the exchange’s efforts, numerous users have reported ongoing difficulties, with many still unable to access their assets.



While the exact cause of the Coinbase outage has not been disclosed, such disruptions on centralized exchanges can significantly erode mainstream trust in the cryptocurrency industry. These platforms serve as the primary entry point for individuals entering digital asset investments due to their user-friendly interfaces.




SEC Lawsuit Adds to Coinbase’s Challenges



This incident is not isolated to Coinbase; the exchange has previously encountered similar technical issues during periods of high trading volumes. Moreover, Coinbase is grappling with legal challenges from regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



In a recent development, a U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the SEC‘s lawsuit against Coinbase has sufficient grounds to proceed. The lawsuit alleges that Coinbase operates as an illegal, unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency, adding further uncertainty for the exchange and its users.

WIF, PEPE DOGE dominate as memecoins surge 114%: What's next? - AMBCrypto



Memecoins sector shows massive growth year to date, outperforming all competitors.
DOGE, WIF and PEPE see a decline in social activity.

The memecoin space has seen the highest growth across all crypto sectors. According to recent data provided by Artemis, the sector is up by 114% YTD.
Memecoins dominate
The popularity and growth of WIF, PEPE and DOGE has had a lot to do with the growth of the memecoin sector. Notably, this sector beat Centralized Exchange tokens, DePIN tokens, and even AI tokens.
Source: Artemis
However, things could take a turn for the worse for these memecoins in the future.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the social volume for WIF and DOGE had declined significantly over the past month. A fall in popularity could mean a fall in price for these tokens.
As other memecoins such as TRUMP and BODEN begin taking center stage on social media platforms, tokens such as WIF and DOGE risk losing market share.
These memecoins would need to regain popularity on social networks to keep their price momentum positive.
PEPE, on the other hand, did witness a spike in Social Volume over the past few days, which suggested that it had managed to stay relevant on social media platforms despite other entrants in the market.
Source: Santiment
In terms of sentiment, there was a similar pattern observed. The Weighted Sentiment for WIF and DOGE declined materially, indicating that criticisms of these tokens across social media platforms were on the rise.
However, PEPE continued to show consistent growth in this department, indicating that the overall perspective around the memecoin was positive.
Source: Santiment
Looking at the data
In terms of network growth, PEPE showed improvements as well over the last few days, indicating that new addresses were starting to show interest in the coin.
DOGE saw a surge in velocity over the last few days, implying an uptick in the frequency of transactions, whereas WIF observed a similar uptick in terms of transaction volume.
Source: Santiment
In terms of price movement, over the last week, DOGE and PEPE have managed to perform positively. However, WIF, the newer entrant in the market, has failed to do so.
PEPE witnessed a growth of 14.98% over the past week, whereas DOGE surged by 3% during the same period. WIF, on the other hand, saw a decline of 10% during this period.

Ripple Trading Volume Increases 40% Quarterly Amid Ongoing SEC Lawsuit - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Ripple’s Q1 2024 report reveals a substantial 40% surge in Ripple trading volumes to $865 million.



The SEC seeks remedies of approximately $2 billion from Ripple, triggering a vigorous legal battle over disgorgement and penalties.



Despite legal uncertainties, Ripple remains confident in the judicial process.




Ripple’s Q1 2024 XRP Markets Report, released on May 17, 2024, underscores significant advancements within the XRP markets and the broader cryptocurrency realm.





Ripple Trading Volumes Surge in Q1 2024 Amid Regulatory Scrutiny



Highlighting a surge in Ripple trading volumes, the report unveils a noteworthy 40% increase to $865 million in Q1 2024, compared to Q4 2023. Concurrently, daily average XRP derivatives open interest rose to $500 million, up from $460 million in the previous quarter, reflecting robust trading activity amidst ongoing regulatory scrutiny.



Despite regulatory challenges, including an ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), investor interest in XRP persists. The report emphasizes the correlation between Ripple trading volumes and market activity, indicating resilience within the XRP market.



Ripple Expresses Confidence in Judicial Process Despite Regulatory Challenges



The SEC’s pursuit of remedies against Ripple for its historic Institutional Sales of XRP further complicates the landscape. Seeking approximately $2 billion, including disgorgement, prejudgment interest, penalties, and an injunction, the SEC’s move has sparked Ripple‘s vigorous opposition.




Ripple contends that the law does not justify disgorgement without demonstrated harm, proposing a penalty of no more than $10 million in the absence of fraud or recklessness allegations. The SEC rebutted Ripple’s arguments on May 6.



Looking ahead, both parties anticipate the Judge’s ruling on final remedies, expected in the coming months. Ripple expresses confidence in the judicial process, banking on a fair approach from the court. Amidst legal uncertainties, the XRP market maintains its vibrancy, buoyed by continued investor confidence in its long-term prospects.

Notcoin First Campaigns Prepared to Launch Next Week - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Notcoin first campaigns will be launched next week, offering rewards but cautioning against unstaking.



With 35M+ users, Notcoin launched at $1B value via airdrops and exchanges.



Staking incentivizes token retention; 78% is allocated to miners and 22% to growth.




The web3 clicker game Notcoin (NOT) unveiled its forthcoming plans, highlighting the imminent launch of Notcoin first campaigns and products set for the upcoming week.





Notcoin First Campaigns Revealed With Reward System



Following these Notcoin first campaigns, Gold and Platinum users are set to receive allocations from subsequent launches. However, users should note that unstaking Notcoin and withdrawing on-chain will result in the forfeiture of Level benefits and access to the prize pool.



Notcoin, a gaming token boasting over 35 million users, has made waves by debuting with a fully diluted value (FDV) of $1 billion. Its distribution occurred through a combination of airdrops and various exchanges.



Early players engaged with the game via the Telegram app, accruing Notcoin from January to April through virtual coin clicks and in-game challenges. These in-game balances underwent conversion at a ratio of 1000:1.




Staking Mechanism Introduced as Notcoin Allocates Tokens for Growth



Preceding the token generation event on Thursday, pre-market trading commenced in March through an NFT trading system, with nearly 800,000 NFT vouchers now convertible into NOT tokens at the same ratio via the Notcoin app.



The total NOT token supply amounts to 102.7 billion, with 78% allocated to miners and NFT voucher holders, while the remaining 22% is earmarked for new users, traders, and future development endeavors, as outlined by the Notcoin team.



Additionally, the project has implemented a staking mechanism to incentivize airdrop participants to retain their tokens. Staking is integral for earning supplementary rewards and unlocking access to more lucrative staking pools, contingent upon the player’s in-game level.

Aussie admits to promoting BitConnect crypto services without a license

An Australian man has pleaded guilty to his involvement in promoting cryptocurrency lending services for the now-defunct crypto exchange Bitconnect — an infamous entity that allegedly ran as a Ponzi scheme and shut down in 2018 amid accusations of defrauding victims of more than $2.4 billion.“Mr. Bigatton provided financial product advice without holding an Australian Financial Services license or authorization to provide financial services about the lending platform,” the Australian Securities and Exchange Commission (ASIC) declared in a May 17 statement.ASIC alleged that in his role as BitConnect's national promoter, John Louis Anthony Bigatton offered financial product advice on six occasions at different locations across Australia, at four seminars, and through two social media posts.“Mr Bigatton undertook promotional activities for BitConnect and the Lending Platform on social media, at seminars that he hosted at various locations around Australia, and through face-to-face meetings with investors.”BitConnect's lending platform was promoted as an investment opportunity, encouraging investors to buy BitConnect coin (BCC) through its website.Investors could loan BCC for a fixed time in return for high interest rates. Once invested, they couldn't control their loans or withdraw their money until the lending period ended. This was allegedly set up in this way so the platform could operate as a Ponzi scheme, paying early BitConnect investors with money from later investors, according to the IRS.A sentencing hearing is set for July 5.Related: Crypto personality pleads guilty to fraud after promising 60% 'fictitious' returnsBitConnect launched in February 2016, and operated a platform and a digital currency, before shutting down in January 2018, with founders eventually vanishing with investors’ money. A few years later, in January 2023, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California ordered a restitution of $17 million for the fraudulent scheme.A group of crypto fraud victims of the BitConnect investment scheme saw some respite from the multi-billion dollar fraud scheme after a court ordered they receive a share in a $17 million restitution.The whereabouts of founder Satish Kumbhani is still unknown.Magazine: Buy altcoins now, but sell before ‘mid-2025’: Charles Edwards, X Hall of Flame

Bitcoin Bull Cycle Not Over by Any Stretch of the Imagination, Says Analyst Jason Pizzino - Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl


								Analyst and trader Jason Pizzino believes that Bitcoin (BTC) is gearing up for a big upside move en route to fresh all-time highs.
Pizzino tells his 326,000 YouTube subscribers that the Bitcoin bull market is just taking a breather as it consolidates below its immediate resistance at around $69,000.










According to the analyst, it is only a matter of time before BTC breaks out of consolidation and prints gains of around 100% from current levels. The trader uses the Fibonacci extension tool to identify his big BTC price target.
“I don’t think the cycle’s over by any stretch of the imagination, so I’m just going to look to the upside targets.
And the first one there is $135,000. We will just use some easy round numbers here. Now if it was to do twice this particular move [$3,000 to $68,000], so that range for quick maths is about $65,000. So you’re just projecting $65,000 off the top, takes to about that you know $135,000.”
Source: Jason Pizzino/X
Bitcoin is trading at $66,988 at time of writing, up more than 2.50% in the past 24 hours.
The widely followed analyst also says that there are other “interesting” price levels he will be on the lookout for before Bitcoin can potentially double from the current point.
“Obviously, $100,000 is going to be a number that everyone’s going to be looking at, a bit of a psychological level. Probably big parties going on there ‘Bitcoin to $100,000,’ all that sort of jazz.
And then these next two – these other ones in between $115,000, $120,000 but I’m interested through here now about $130,000 to $150,000. What goes on with Bitcoin at that time? And on top of that, what happens if we get some other sort of rallies and corrections?…
That’s going to be the next major interesting point when it comes to projecting these price targets for the end of the cycle.”

The Fastest Altcoins of the Cryptocurrency World Has Been Determined: Here is the Ranking - Bitcoin Sistemi


The list of altcoin networks that enable users to make the fastest transactions in the cryptocurrency market has been published.
In the list in question, the maximum daily average per second speeds of altcoin networks were measured. The list is shaped like this:



Solana – 1,054 TPS
Sui – 854 TPS
BSC – 378 TPS
Polygon – 190 TPS
TONS – 175 TPS
Tron – 160 TPS
Near – 118 TPS
Avalanche – 89 TPS
Cronos – 72 TPS
Gnosis – 66 TPS
Phantom – 59 TPS
Arbitrum – 59 TPS
Linea – 56 TPS
Aptos – 49 TPS
Base – 37 TPS
Mantle – 25 TPS
Ethereum – 23 TPS
Starknet – 12 TPS
Optimism – 12 TPS
Bitcoin – 11 TPS
Blast – 10 TPS
Merlin – 7 TPS
Mode – 7 TPS
zkLink Nova – 4 TPS
Thorchain – 2 TPS

Solana has proven to be the fastest among the major blockchains, with its actual daily average transactions per second (TPS) breaking a record, reaching 1,504 on April 6 this year, amid the memecoin craze. This makes Solana 46 times faster than Ethereum and 5 times faster than Polygon, which has the highest TPS among Ethereum scaling solutions.

The second fastest blockchain was Sui, which also does not have an EVM, and recorded the highest real TPS value with 854 in July 2023, with the onchain game called Sui 8192 gaining popularity.





BNB Smart Chain (BSC) reached 378 in real TPS on December 7, 2023, driven by an inscription-driven increase in on-chain activity. This makes BSC the fastest blockchain among EVMs, but it ranks only third overall and can achieve less than half the throughput speed of Sui.

Param Labs Raises $7 Million to Revolutionize Web3 Gaming Infrastructure



                    

Gaming infrastructure developer Param Labs has secured $7 million in a heavily oversubscribed funding round. 



Led by crypto venture capital firm Animoca Brands, the round also saw participation from Delphi Ventures, Cypher Capital, P2 Ventures (formerly Polygon Ventures), Mechanism Capital, Merit Circle, TRGC Capital, Double Peak Group, and MH Ventures.




The funds will tackle one of Web3 gaming’s biggest challenges: the lack of foundational infrastructure. 



Anthony Anderson, CEO of Param Labs and Kiraverse, emphasized the importance of modular gaming ecosystems in establishing the foundation for future Web3 games.



Anderson told Cointelegraph, “Unlike most Web3 studios that focus on developing single game titles, modular ecosystems offer a variety of products and components. 




This allows developers to build their own games from these modules and provides essential tools for other developers to utilize and integrate into their projects.”



The funding round comes as the Param Gaming Platform experiences significant growth, boasting over 300,000 daily active users (DAUs) and a X page with more than 2.5 million followers.



Strategic investments were also made by Animoca Labs co-founder Yat Siu and FaZe Clan founder Banks. 



Yat Siu highlighted the potential of Param Labs in realizing an open metaverse, stating, “We’re excited to partner with Param Labs to advance digital property rights in gaming, bringing us a step closer to realizing the vision of the truly open metaverse.

This collaboration aligns with our shared vision to redefine the gaming landscape, ensuring that gamers are the true owners of their digital assets.”



The absence of Web3 gaming infrastructure poses significant hurdles for blockchain integration, hindering mainstream adoption. 



Anderson remarked, “Focusing on infrastructure is crucial as it not only addresses the challenges in the games we’re developing but also has the potential to be applied to hundreds, if not thousands, of other experiences. 



This will significantly contribute to the adoption of blockchain gaming.”



This issue was highlighted by Wanderers game founder Nick Greenawalt, who shared a gameplay preview ironically dubbing it “the future of gaming.” 



The video, showing gameplay interrupted by MetaMask wallet prompts, underscored the need for seamless gaming infrastructure.



Anderson concluded that for mainstream adoption, Web3 games must integrate crypto assets and Web3 technology organically, avoiding friction points. 



“Gamers should be able to interact with on-chain assets without even realizing it, while still benefiting from features like trading assets with friends and monetizing their in-game time,” he said.

The Cryptonomist

A few days ago Scroll, a well-known layer-2 ZK rollup of the Ethereum blockchain, introduced the “Sessions” loyalty program anticipating the launch of its governance token, which will likely be distributed to the community through a crypto airdrop.
Sessions is nothing more than a points campaign where users of the cryptographic ecosystem can earn “Marks” by performing various interactions with the Scroll network and increasing the allocation for the airdrop.
Let’s see together how to become eligible.
All the details below.

Scroll and the launch of the “Sessions” campaign in preparation for the crypto airdrop
The Ethereum Scroll layer-2 is making airdrop hunters dream after the “Sessions” campaign was released, anticipating the launch of the rollup governance crypto.
This is a loyalty program that rewards the community for supporting the growth of the cryptographic network, through a points-based incentive system.

In every project these points, which are then converted into crypto airdrop at the time of the TGE, take on a different name: on Scroll they are called “Marks“.
Basically, the more Marks we accumulate, the greater our contribution to the Scroll blockchain, and therefore the richer the allocation for the airdrop will be.
To check your progress so far, you can visit this link, connect your wallet, and sign in with which you accept the terms and conditions of this campaign.

At the moment we are in the “Session 0” of this loyalty system.
In the coming weeks, new Sessions will be announced, each with a different theme and a different way to earn new Marks.
In Session 0, to accumulate points, it is sufficient to bridge funds from the Ethereum Mainnet to the Scroll network using the native bridge or LayerZero, and hold the coins on the layer-2: Marks will be credited every 24 hours!
As also stated in the Scroll press release: “No further transactions or activities are required for Session Zero”
The assets that entitle to points are ETH and wstETH for the native bridge, and STONE for the bridge through LayerZero technology. In the coming days, new eligible assets will be announced that will compete in the creation of new Marks.
We would like to point out that those who interacted with Scroll consuming gas fees from the launch of the mainnet on October 10, 2023 until April 29, 2024, received a substantial bonus.

How to qualify from now on to receive the crypto airdrop?
Most likely in the upcoming Sessions new Marks will be generated for various types of interactions within the Scroll network such as, swap, liquidity providing, NFT trading, etc.
The metrics that will likely be adopted are:
volume of exchange;
number of transactions executed;
number of contracts used.
Without knowing how the next Sessions will be managed, we can still try to anticipate some interactions by trying out the most well-known dapps in the Scroll ecosystem such as, Aave, Compound, Syncswap, KyberSwap, Iziswap, Rubic, Sushiswap, Layerbank, Lido, Stargate, Orbiter Finance, KelpDAO, StakeStone, SynFutures, DodoX, etc.
For further tips on how to farm the Scroll airdrop you can visit this article.
Surely, if you want to try to be eligible for the distribution of the new crypto, it will be essential to bridge ETH from Ethereum to Scroll.
Take advantage now to do this kind of interaction because gas on Ethereum is very low at the moment (around 6 gwei), at one of its lowest levels in the last 4 years.
To give you an idea, a native bridge on Scroll can cost about 2-3 dollars in fees, while a few months ago it could cost as much as 20-30 dollars.
Source: https://dune.com/hildobby/gas
Some data from the layer-2 Scroll
Less than a year after its mainnet launch, Scroll can boast a decent popularity within the Ethereum rollup layer-2 panorama.
According to L2beat, the network has a TVL of 425 million dollars in locked assets, positioning it as the 12th richest scaling networks on Ethereum.
From mid-April onwards we have witnessed an explosion of this metric, which has more than doubled in less than a month, thanks mainly to the growing attention from retail users who are heavily investing in Scroll in anticipation of a crypto airdrop.
Source: https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/scroll
In the last 30 days, the layer-2 has counted over 10 million transactions, with a daily TP/S of 4.17. According to Dune Analytics, in the last week Scroll has recorded 2.7 million tx, with 359,000 tx just yesterday.
Overall, the number of transactions, as well as the number of active wallets (both on a weekly basis), seems to be growing since the beginning of 2024.
Despite this, the revenue of ETH sequencers, i.e. the entities responsible for organizing data on L2 and communicating with L1, has been declining since March when the Dencun update was implemented.
Specifically, from the end of March until now, the weekly earnings of this entity have decreased from 950 ETH at the end of March to the current 274 ETH.
Source: https://dune.com/scroll/scroll-key-metrics
Despite the excellent results, Scroll still remains today a layer-2 “expensive” to use, with commission costs far exceeding those of infrastructures like Starknet, Optimism, and Arbitrum.
Indeed, these latest networks allow nowadays to perform swaps and transfer funds paying less than 0.01 dollars in fees, while on Scroll the costs still remain around 0.10 dollars for the same operations.
Keep in mind the presence of these costs if you are planning to participate in this crypto airdrop.
In order to become even more popular in the cryptographic sector, Scroll will have to improve this limitation of its own by competing with the big players in the world of Ethereum rollups.
The trend seems to be heading towards lower transaction fees.

Bitcoin: ATM crypto in crescita da dieci mesi

Crypto ATMs, which allow you to buy Bitcoin for example by paying in cash with physical banknotes, have been steadily growing for ten months.
It is revealed by an analysis by AltIndex which highlights how since July of last year they have increased by 5,600 units worldwide.

Bitcoin news: the role of crypto ATMs
Crypto ATMs are automatic teller machines, very similar to bank ones, that allow the buying and selling of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. 
They have been around for several years now, so much so that CoinAtmRadar has been tracking them for almost eleven years, and are commonly considered the safest way to convert fiat currency into crypto.
They can also be used, on the other hand, to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies, but not all of them offer this service. 
Furthermore, they do not support all cryptocurrencies, but only the main ones, including of course Bitcoin.
If in the early years of their diffusion they also allowed anonymous purchases, i.e. without KYC, this type of purchase has been made illegal in many countries, and so for some time now they allow the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies in cash only after registration and verification of the user’s identity.
The rise of Bitcoin ATMs 
In the first half of 2023 there was a sharp drop in crypto ATMs, both due to the bear market of 2022 and especially because of the new laws that forced many companies to remove those without KYC. 
After reaching the peak in December 2022, with over 39,000 installed and mapped worldwide, they dropped to 32,000 in July of last year, with about 7,000 crypto ATMs closed within seven months. 
However, since then a process of continuous growth has been triggered, which has been going on for ten consecutive months now, bringing the number back to over 37,000. The record of December 2022 is still a bit far away, but it is at the same level as April 2022. 
Furthermore, from the peak of December 2022, only 1,600 are missing. 
Note that at the end of 2020, at the beginning of the last major bull run, they do not exceed 12,000. 
According to AltIndex, the renewed popularity of crypto ATMs is due to the impressive performance of cryptocurrency prices in 2024.
The crypto ATM market
Note that the growth of the last ten months has been driven by the USA. 
The United States has always been the country with the highest number of crypto ATMs, so much so that out of the 37,000 currently mapped, almost 31,000 are there. Therefore, over 80% of all crypto ATMs in the world are installed in the USA.
Furthermore, more than 75% of all new devices installed in the last ten months have been placed in US cities, so much so that the total number of crypto ATMs in the USA has risen from 26,800 to almost 31,000. 
The significantly lower figure in Europe (1,600) is surprising, which is nineteen times lower than that of the USA. Furthermore, in Europe, only 156 have been installed in the last few months, while in Asia they have even decreased by 350 units.
It is obvious that these ATMs are more commonly used where there is a higher usage of cash in the form of paper banknotes, and where legal regulations make installation and management easier.
It is worth noting that 70% of all crypto ATMs in the world belong to just ten operators, while the remaining 30% belong to another 474 operators. The single largest operator in the world is Bitcoin Depot, which alone holds a market share of 20%, and more than 7,500 ATMs. 
The second operator is Coinflip, with a market share of 13%, followed by Bitstop, RockItCoin, and Athena Bitcoin (6%). 
This makes the crypto ATM sector decidedly competitive.
The most recent data
2024 has been a very positive year for Bitcoin and for crypto ATMs. 
The rise in cryptocurrency prices has stimulated the demand for these automatic tellers, after a difficult 2023 in which their number returned to 2021 levels.
The most difficult month was indeed July 2023, when in just one month the crypto ATMs decreased by over 4,000 units worldwide. 
Just think that at that time there were only ten crypto ATMs in the whole of Great Britain, with a reduction of over 88%, since previously there were more than 80.
Since then, however, the trend has reversed, with a rise that seems to be continuing even now. 
The month with the highest number of new machines installed was September 2023, with approximately 1,000 new crypto ATMs. The following month, the increase was also similar. 
Since in the last few months the rate at which they are increasing has decreased, it is possible that September and October 2023 was a sort of reaction to the black July of the same year. 
These numbers also do not take into account the exchanges of cryptocurrencies into digital fiat currencies that take place on exchanges, which are also increasing. 
They actually concern almost exclusively cash exchanges, since crypto ATMs tend to have higher fees compared to online exchanges, which are therefore preferred whenever possible.
Crypto ATMs, on the other hand, have no rivals for cash exchanges, as the alternative (direct P2P exchanges in person between buyers and sellers) is to be considered high risk.

The future crypto trends in 2024: the analysis by Gracy Chen of Bitget

According to Gracy Chen from Biget, in 2024, the crypto landscape will follow several trends: it will evolve with technological innovation and a focus on integrity and security, while artificial intelligence will transform the way cryptocurrencies are traded and invested in.
Let’s see below all the details. 

Trends 2024: evolution towards greater transparency and security in the crypto sector
As anticipated, according to Chen from Bitget, with the current cryptocurrency market showing signs of a gradual rise, 2024 promises to be a crucial year for the evolution and transformation of the sector.
After a period of consolidation lasting almost two years, the cryptocurrency business is preparing for new directions. But what are the main trends that will shape this evolving landscape?
First of all, the ‘artificial intelligence (AI), which continues to revolutionize the way investors and traders interact with the cryptocurrency market.
With the availability of trading bots, oracles, assistants, and mentors powered by AI, users have advanced tools at their disposal to maximize their profits. 
The rapid development in the AI sector results in a constant flow of new solutions, with numerous startups focusing on the development of AI and machine learning technologies.
The era of closed and reserved cryptocurrencies is now behind us. Companies in the sector, like Bitget, are embracing transparency as a fundamental principle.
This is manifested through the regular publication of reports on the state of reserves and the size of insurance funds, as well as the adoption of open and direct communication practices with users. 
This new transparency standard not only increases investors’ trust, but also helps promote a more secure and sustainable crypto environment.
Education on blockchain technology
Furthermore, to ensure sustainable growth in the cryptocurrency sector, it is essential to improve understanding and awareness of blockchain technology. 
In this context, companies are intensifying educational and informative efforts, aiming to engage an increasingly wider audience, including the new generations. 
Initiatives like the educational campaign Blockchain4Youth by Bitget, which collaborates with universities around the world, illustrate the sector’s commitment to a future where knowledge and adoption of blockchain are widespread on a global scale.
2024 is shaping up to be a crucial year for the cryptocurrency sector, where innovation, transparency, and education play a key role in shaping the future of the crypto business. 
Crypto and social responsibility: a future of commitment and use
The cryptocurrency business, through a growing regulatory development, is breaking away from the shadows to embrace greater social responsibility. Thus contributing to solving society’s problems. 
More and more crypto companies are launching charitable and social initiatives, offering support to victims of natural disasters, pandemics, and conflicts. This trend is expected to grow in the near future.
Bitget, for example, has launched a series of social initiatives, including assistance to victims of natural disasters and the Blockchain4Her program to support women entrepreneurs. 
Through this program, participants not only receive valuable advice from experts, but also financial grants for the development or start-up of entrepreneurial activities.
Another trend that will drive the future of the industry is the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. Already today, several countries are accepting cryptocurrencies for the purchase of goods such as real estate, software, jewelry, and luxury goods. 
With the development of cryptocurrency processing technologies and the increasingly widespread adoption of credit cards with crypto payment functionality, it is likely that an increasing number of users may use cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services in the next five years.
These trends highlight a significant transformation in the way cryptocurrencies interact with society and integrate into the global economy. 
As the sector embraces greater social responsibility and promotes the adoption of cryptocurrencies as a mainstream form of payment, it paves the way for a more inclusive and sustainable future.

Polkadot (DOT) Price: Can Bullish Momentum Overcome Slump?


In this comprehensive analysis, we delve into Polkadot’s recent price surge, driven by both technical and on-chain indicators
Penetrating the daily Ichimoku cloud could indicate continued price appreciation towards $8.
Polkadot Technical Outlook: Understanding the Surge
Polkadot (DOT) has broken above the 4-hour Ichimoku cloud. Returning to the cloud in the 4-hour timeframe could signal a trend reversal. On the daily timeframe, the price of Polkadot is approaching the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud.

Polkadot On-Chain Data: A Deep Dive
The chart illustrates that the number of new addresses on the Polkadot Relay Chain has experienced two consecutive monthly declines. This trend is a bearish indicator. Polkadot is currently struggling to attract new entrants to the network.

A sustained reduction in the number of new addresses can impact the overall health and expansion of the Polkadot ecosystem.
Read More: What Is Polkadot (DOT)? 

Number of New Addresses on the Polkadot Relay Chain (7DMA). Source: IntoTheBlock 
Active addresses are a key indicator of user engagement and network health. In the context of Polkadot, this decline could mean several things:

First, it might indicate that existing users are less active, possibly due to a lack of compelling projects, updates, or incentives to maintain engagement. 
Second, it could reflect broader market trends affecting the entire cryptocurrency space, where users are becoming more cautious or shifting their focus to other platforms. 
Third, a decrease in active addresses on a blockchain focused on interoperability could imply challenges in maintaining its unique value proposition compared to other Layer 0 or Layer 1 solutions.

The chart below illustrates the 7-day moving average (7DMA) of daily transfers on the Polkadot Relay Chain. This highlights a significant downward trend. Following a peak in January 2024, where daily transfers nearly reached 40,000, the number of transfers has steadily declined.

This decline in transfer volume can have several implications for Polkadot’s price. Reduced transfer activity often correlates with lower overall network usage and decreased demand for the native DOT token (in the mid-term).

Strategic Recommendations and Future Price Implications
Neutral Outlook

Polkadot (DOT) has demonstrated an upward trend, breaking the 4-hour Ichimoku cloud to the upside. This technical pattern suggests potential bullish momentum. However, traders should be cautious as a pullback to the cloud in the 4-hour timeframe could signal a trend reversal.
The recent upward trend in Polkadot’s price is heavily influenced by the broader market movements, notably the increase in Bitcoin’s price. Additionally, speculative activities around Polkadot’s derivatives contracts on centralized exchanges have contributed to the price surge. 
While the technical indicators point towards bullish momentum, the on-chain data highlights potential risks. The decrease in new and active addresses and reduced transfer volumes signal a decline in user engagement and network activity.

Entry Points and Risk Management

Traders should consider entering long positions on Polkadot if it successfully penetrates the 4H Ichimoku cloud to the downside, targeting a move toward $8. However, monitoring Bitcoin’s price movements is crucial, as a test of the $61K level by Bitcoin could lead to a sharp correction in DOT’s price. Although the probability of such a correction has decreased, it remains a risk, particularly in the event of macroeconomic or geopolitical factors.
In the mid to long term, traders should employ risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders below key support levels (6 – $6.4) to mitigate potential losses.

U.S. Bitcoin ETFs Q1: Major institutions hold $10.7 billion, but… - AMBCrypto



U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw massive demand from investment firms in Q1
Off-chain transactions linked to BTC ETFs have raised eyebrows, but they are part of the ‘cash redemption’ feature. 

Large institutions jumped on the Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs trend in Q1, with holdings worth $10.7 billion, according to an analysis by Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan. 
Hougan’s data showed that 944 firms with AUM (assets under management) over $100 million revealed holdings in U.S. spot BTC ETFs.  
Even hedge fund (HF) firms like Steven Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management, Citadel Advisors, Millennium Management, and Elliot Investment Management jumped on the BTC ETF bandwagon. 
In particular, Millennium Management dominated the HF list with over $2 billion across four ETFs, per Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. 
U.S. Bitcoin ETFs’ cash redemptions and off-chain transactions
However, as one of the market watchers, Tyler Durden, noted, most of the above transactions were done off-chain. 
“Blackrock can take as much Bitcoin as they want from Coinbase, and the transaction is recorded off-chain.”
However, Dave Weisberger of Coinroutes quipped that the ‘off-chain transactions’ are part of the ‘cash redemption’ feature of the U.S. spot BTC ETF products. 
“Of course, they had to do it that way because of the “cash creation/redemption” the SEC forced.   The APs can’t “touch” spot Bitcoin, so MUST engage in off-chain transactions.”
Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart echoed Weisberger’s take. 
For the uninitiated, the cash redemption or creation feature means that the spot BTC ETF transactions can only be settled in cash, whether one is buying or selling the U.S. BTC ETF shares. 
However, according to Weisberger, this doesn’t mean the respective ETF issuers don’t have a 1:1 backing of the underlying spot BTC. 
“Means nothing with respect to the ETFs holdings.  It doesn’t change the fact the ETFs, by their approved charter, MUST hold full backing in spot Bitcoin at the custodian for all SETTLED shares” 
Intelligence data providers like Arkham track most of the U.S. spot BTC ETF issuer’s wallets. However, the aforementioned off-chain transactions derail transparency, a key ethos of blockchain. 
Most industry figures have argued that ‘in kind’ redemptions and creations could have been better, more efficient, and transparent. That’s what you get with recently launched Hong Kong’s spot ETFs. 
The ‘in kind’ redemption refers to the capacity to settle transactions using the underlying asset, whether BTC or Ethereum [ETH]. So, instead of cash, the ETF shares are traded using the underlying crypto assets.
 Such on-chain transactions are efficient and transparent because they are traceable using various blockchain explorers like Etherscan.
The U.S. spot BTC ETFs could have enjoyed more transparency from the ‘in kind’ feature; however, the off-chain transaction will continue as part of SEC’s guidelines.

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) Will Skyrocket 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, As Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GAMBCAT has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gambling Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gambling Cat could become the next viral memecoin.



Gambling Cat launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gambling Cat on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gambling Cat by entering its contract address – B4BQTfBJ6uQYkzaZyQjTmH7k3c9gzXQ3FrPMPDstpYAn – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAMBCAT.

Genesis Global secures court approval for $3B payout

Bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global has secured court approval to return about $3 billion in cash and cryptocurrency to its creditors. This decision leaves its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), with no recovery from the bankruptcy.Judge Sean Lane approved Genesis’s Chapter 11 repayment plan on Friday, May 17. The ruling clears the path for Genesis to unfreeze and return customer assets that have been locked up since the company halted withdrawals in November 2022 following the collapse of several major cryptocurrency firms.However, Lane overruled an objection raised by DCG, which argued that Genesis should pay its customers and creditors no more than the value of the crypto assets in January 2023, when Genesis filed for bankruptcy. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has increased significantly since then, from around $24,000 at the time to over $66,700 on May 17.Lane dismissed DCG’s legal challenge, stating in a 135-page ruling that Genesis’ parent company lacked the legal standing to contest the Chapter 11 plan.As a shareholder in Genesis, DCG holds a junior position in the repayment hierarchy under Chapter 11 proceedings. According to Lane, any available funds for distribution by Genesis are being exhausted by creditor claims, which take priority over DCG’s equity stake. Due to the enormous creditor claims, Lane deemed DCG’s equity interest essentially valueless, with a multibillion-dollar shortfall. Related: Digital Currency Group first-quarter revenue jumps 51% despite GBTC outflowsHe dismissed DCG’s objection, ruling that even with capped customer claims, Genesis must prioritize paying numerous other creditors, including federal and state financial regulators, with $32 billion in claims before distributing any funds to DCG, its equity owner.Genesis is one of multiple cryptocurrency lending firms affected by the massive crypto bear market of 2022. The lender filed for bankruptcy in January 2023 after suspending withdrawals following a liquidity crisis in mid-November 2022. The firm reportedly owes more than $3.5 billion to its top 50 creditors, including firms like Gemini.Genesis has been working to liquidate $1.6 billion of its assets after failing to reach settlements with DCG and its former business partner, Gemini.Genesis previously said in November 2023 that DCG agreed to pay its outstanding $324.5 million in loans by April 2024. The proposed deal aimed to allow Genesis to end a lawsuit filed against DCG in September that sought to have the firm repay overdue loans worth around $620 million.Magazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom

If SEC approves spot Ether ETFs, many ‘will be caught severely offside’

Despite unfavorable odds from several crypto analysts and the broader crypto community regarding the approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETF) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), some analysts suggest that “there is room for surprise.”“If by some chance the SEC decides to approve then so many will be caught severely offside,” crypto trader Matthew Hyland told his 142,000 X followers in a May 17 post.“If 90% of people think the ETH ETF will be denied, and the majority of those people think it will lead to a crypto crash then who will actually be selling?” he added before declaring that the expectation of denial is “priced in.” At the time of publication, Ether (ETH) is trading at $3,102, as per CoinMarketCap data.Ether is currently trading at $3,102, up 6.31% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCapBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has placed his odds for approval at 35%, while the broader crypto community has set their estimates closer to the 7% mark, according to New York-based crypto predictions platform Polymarket.Meanwhile, crypto exchange Coinbase institutional research analyst David Han believes “there is room for surprise to the upside on this decision.”“We believe the odds of approval are closer to 30-40%,” Han stated in Coinbase’s monthly outlook report published on May 15.Related: Filing suggests SEC is exploring grounds to deny spot Ether ETFsHan explained that as cryptocurrency becomes a more prominent issue for voters in the lead-up to the upcoming November United States presidential election, the SEC will be less likely to maintain its stance on a denial decision.“As crypto begins to take form as an election issue, it’s also less certain in our view that the SEC would be willing to front the political capital necessary to support a denial,” he stated.Han further argued that even if the VanEck and ARK Invest ETF applications are denied by the initial deadline of May 23, there is a strong possibility that litigation could overturn that decision.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Taps $67K, Ethereum (ETH) Climbs Above $3.1K (Weekend Watch)


																Bitcoin’s most recent run continued in the past 24 hours as the asset’s price climbed to its highest price in over a month at just over $67,400 yesterday.
Ethereum has also joined the party at last, having surged past the coveted resistance line of $3,000 and jumping above $3,100.
BTC Sees 5-Week Peak
Bitcoin suffered a lot at the start of May as it dumped to a multi-month low of under $57,000. It began to recover some ground in the following week when it soared past $65,000 on May 6 but quickly reversed its trajectory and saw its price dropping to under $61,000 on May 10.
The bulls intercepted the move at this point and didn’t allow any further declines. Just the opposite, BTC maintained its ground last weekend and started climbing on Monday to just over $63,000. Another brief correction came on Tuesday to $61,200, but the lowering inflation rates in the US, which were announced on Wednesday, sent the cryptocurrency flying.
In a matter of hours, BTC skyrocketed by several grand and jumped past $66,000. Although there was another brief retracement, the growing Bitcoin ETF inflows meant more price gains for the underlying asset, which charted a 5-week high of over $67,400 yesterday.

Despite losing some ground since then, BTC still trades around $67,000 now. Its market cap has increased to $1.320 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the alts is slightly down to 51.6%.

ETH Goes Beyond $3.1K
The second-largest cryptocurrency was among those who trailed behind in terms of gains, as reported earlier and was losing ground to BTC. This was because ETH couldn’t reclaim decisively $3,000 despite several challenges in the past few weeks.
However, that resistance level finally gave in yesterday, which allowed Ether to shoot up above $3,100 for the first time in over a week.
Most other larger-cap alts are also in the green, with gains of around 1-2%. In contrast, Toncoin has retraced by more than 3%, and so has HEAR, which is down by 4%.
The total crypto market cap has added around $20 billion overnight and is now at $2.560 trillion on CG.

Crypto Lender Genesis Wins Court Approval for $3 Billion Repayment Plan - Coin Edition


							

Judge approves $3 billion Genesis plan.



Repayment prioritizes current crypto value.



Ruling sets precedent for future cases.




In a victory for creditors, a U.S. bankruptcy judge on Friday approved a plan by Genesis Global Capital, a bankrupt cryptocurrency lender, to repay approximately $3 billion in a combination of digital assets and cash. The ruling by Judge Sean Lane of the Southern District of New York overrode objections from Genesis’ parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), which had proposed a different repayment structure.



Under the approved Chapter 11 liquidation plan, Genesis will prioritize repaying creditors with digital assets whenever possible. However, the plan also allows for cash disbursements based on the current market value of those assets. This approach stands in contrast to DCG’s proposal, which sought to peg repayments to the value of cryptocurrencies on the date Genesis filed for bankruptcy in January 2023.



At that time, Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, traded at around $21,084. Since then, the market has experienced a significant rebound, with Bitcoin currently hovering around $66,889 according to TradingView data. This price increase could lead to creditors receiving a more favorable return under Genesis’ plan than DCG had anticipated.



Judge Lane’s decision acknowledged the potential impact of future price fluctuations. He noted that Genesis faces claims from various creditors, including federal and state financial regulators, totaling $32 billion. These claims will be addressed before any distribution to DCG occurs.









A February estimate by Genesis suggested that creditors could recover up to 77% of their claims under the approved plan. However, this figure remains subject to the ongoing volatility of the cryptocurrency market.



In a move that could reshape the landscape of crypto bankruptcy proceedings, Judge Lane’s decision establishes a precedent for prioritizing current market value over historical prices when determining creditor payouts. This ruling is likely to be closely watched by other struggling crypto firms and their creditors, with potential implications for ongoing and future bankruptcy cases within the industry.

ChatGPT Analyzes Which AI Coin Will Be Top Performer in 2024


																TL;DR

ChatGPT predicts these two AI cryptocurrencies have the best chance to emerge as top performers due to their strong growth potential and advanced technology.
Despite its current leadership, Internet Computer (ICP) was not ranked among the top 5 list. The chatbot emphasized that its future performance depends on integrating AI functionalities, investment levels, and regulatory changes.


Observing the Chances
Artificial intelligence (AI) has continued to advance rapidly in the past several months. Earlier this month, OpenAI – an American AI research organization – introduced a new ChatGPT model with an improved voice assistant. The upgrade can even read body motion, such as how heavy a user breathes. 
Somewhat expected, cryptocurrencies related to that evolving technology have experienced an uptick as of late, with the niche’s total market capitalization surpassing the $30 billion mark. We decided to ask ChatGPT which of those assets will be the top performer this year.
The chatbot started its prediction with a disclaimer that topping that ranking depends on various essential factors such as market potential, technology innovation, and recent price increases.
It labeled Bittensor (TAO) as a main contender for the leading position, highlighting its surging market cap and “strong growth potential.” The asset currently trades at around $380 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 725% spike compared to the figure observed in May 2023. Still, TAO significantly retraced from its all-time high of over $720 registered in March this year.





TAO Price, Source: CoinGecko
The next AI cryptocurrency on ChatGPT’s list is Fetch.ai (FET), which is the second-largest in the cohort, with a market cap of around $5.7 billion.
“The project’s advanced technology and broad applicability in industries like supply chain optimization and smart cities make it a strong contender,” the chatbot estimated.
Render (RNDR), SingularityNET (AGIX), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) rounded up the top 5 club. Despite praising the potential for price growth throughout the year, the chatbot warned investors to conduct proper research on the assets’ specific use cases and technological developments before diving into their ecosystem. 
What About the Current Leader?
Interestingly, ChatGPT’s ranking does not include the biggest AI cryptocurrency as of the moment (according to CoinGecko) – Internet Computer (ICP). As such, we asked the chatbot to outline its chances in a separate query.
It claimed that ICP can maintain its leadership spot if it effectively integrates AI functionalities and tools, thus becoming more attractive to developers and companies. 
The chatbot added that the level of investment and funding in its ecosystem and possible regulatory changes can also significantly impact the token’s performance.
ICP is currently hovering around $12.75, witnessing a 190% price increase on a six-month scale. Its market capitalization is close to the $6 billion level, making it the 22nd biggest cryptocurrency.

NEAR, AVAX, Arweave [AR], MetisDAO [METIS]: These are the altcoins to watch - AMBCrypto



CryptoBullet forecasts that NEAR, AR, METIS, and AVAX will hit new all-time highs by 2024, driven by current market trends.
Technical analysis supports a positive outlook, with increasing altcoin trading volume indicating growing investor interest.

As the cryptocurrency market continues its upward trend, led by Bitcoin’s [BTC] robust performance in recent weeks, the global crypto market capitalization has reached approximately $2.5 trillion. 
As a result, altcoins such as Near Protocol [NEAR] and Polkadot [DOT] have demonstrated a fierce upward trend. This bullish wave has sparked optimism among investors and analysts alike. 
Amidst this positive momentum, CryptoBullet, a well-known crypto analyst, has forecasted that four altcoins are set to reach new all-time highs (ATH) by 2024. 
According to CryptoBullet, this period represents a prime opportunity for investors to engage with specific altcoins that are currently undervalued but poised for significant growth.
CryptoBullet’s strategy involves leveraging the current low prices of these altcoins to capitalize on the potential explosive gains in the upcoming bull market.
 The key to pinpointing these promising investments lies in their performance against the Fibonacci retracement levels. 
CryptoBullet identifies those altcoins that have tested or surpassed the 0.618 or even the 0.786 Fibonacci levels as prime candidates for breaking their ATHs.

On the other hand, the analyst disclosed altcoins that would most likely not fare well, noting,
“The ones that are still between 0.382-0.236 likely won’t make it above their 2021 highs (weak coins). Examples: $DOT $AXS $FIL $ADA.”
At the time of writing, DOT was the top gainer among these altcoins, with ADA coming second.
 Particularly, both DOT and ADA have seen an increase of 3.9% and 5%, respectively in the past day, compared to FIL and AXS 0.8% and 0.4% increase over the same period.
NEAR, AR, METIS, AVAX set to surge
CryptoBullet specifically highlighted NEAR, Arweave [AR], MetisDAO [METIS], and Avalanche [AVAX] as the altcoins with the potential to set new records. 
Over the past few weeks, these altcoins have shown bullish trends, with METIS experiencing a slight dip. 
However, despite a 0.9% decline over the past week, METIS has rebounded, currently up by 2.9% in the last 24 hours with a trading price of $60.59. 
This minor downturn is seen as a temporary adjustment before a potential uptrend.
On the other hand, NEAR and AR have demonstrated more significant upward momentum. NEAR has surged by 13.4% in the past week and 36.4% over the past two weeks. 
Similarly, AR has increased by 10.5% in the last week and over 40% in the past fortnight. 
The last 24 hours have seen NEAR and AR rise by 3.6% and 10.1%, with a current trading price of $8.38 and $48.54 respectively, indicating sustained bullishness. 
Avalanche (AVAX) has also shown positive trends, with a current trading price of $37.09, up by 7% in the past day.
Meanwhile, the altcoin dominance, excluding the top 10, stood at 11.91% at the time of writing. Technical analysis of the overall altcoin market shows quite an interesting pattern.

Realistic or not, here’s AVAX’s market cap in BTC’s terms

The market has recently shown a bullish dragonfly candle followed by a bullish engulfing candle, which closes above the dragonfly candle. This pattern suggested that further upward movements were likely.

Additionally, AMBCrypto reports that altcoin trading volume dominance has reached 78%, the highest in two years, signaling growing investor interest in altcoins.

Crypto Whale Buys $5.7 Million ONDO, Followed by Price Spike


Lookonchain, an on-chain analytics platform, reported that a crypto whale created a new wallet on May 16 and withdrew 1,870.68 ETH from the crypto exchange Gemini. Subsequently, the crypto whale used 1,870 ETH to acquire the 6 million ONDO tokens.
This transaction has caught the crypto community’s attention. Coincidentally, ONDO, the native token of Ondo Finance, witnessed a notable price increase following the purchase.
What Comes Next for ONDO’s Price?

On-chain data shows that this crypto whale bought ONDO at an average price of $0.95. This entry price is intriguing, as some analysts believe ONDO’s fair price range is between $0.40 and $0.70. Given their significant investment above the anticipated range, Lookonchain suspects the whale might have insider knowledge.
Following the whale’s purchase, ONDO’s price surged. It surpassed the $1 mark and briefly hit $1.04. This surge brings ONDO closer to its all-time high of $1.05, recorded on March 31.
However, ONDO is trading at $1.03 at the time of writing. The figure marks a 9.9% increase over the last 24 hours and a 26.3% rise in the past week.

Crypto analyst Mags commented on the price movement. He shared his analysis for ONDO’s next price target.

“If the price closes above $1, the next target would be $1.40 and $2.70+,” Mags wrote.

Despite this recent transaction, Ondo Finance, known for its innovative approach to tokenized securities, has recently been in the spotlight. Earlier this month, the platform announced a strategic partnership with Zebec Network.
This collaboration aims to enhance USDY, a stablecoin’s operation. Furthermore, it will integrate Zebec’s Instant Card technology and real-world asset (RWA) payment solutions.

In another significant development, in March, Ondo Finance transferred $95 million to BlackRock’s newly launched tokenized fund, BUIDL. It aims to facilitate instant settlements for the Ondo Short-Term US Government Fund (OUSG), backed by US Treasuries. This move is particularly noteworthy since it is the first time a crypto protocol has used a tokenized fund for its offerings.

According to RWA.xyz data, Ondo’s OUSG is currently the third-largest tokenized fund, with a market capitalization of $135.83 million. This aligns with recent research from CoinGecko, which predicts that RWA will be a dominant crypto narrative in 2024. Based on its data, as of May 18, crypto assets in the RWA category have a cumulative market capitalization of $8.43 billion.

Crypto Trader Says One Large-Cap Memecoin Is ‘About To Rip,’ Updates Outlook on Bitcoin and Solana - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed analyst and trader is expressing bullish sentiment on a leading memecoin while updating his outlook on three other crypto assets.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Kaleo tells his 638,400 followers on the social media platform X that Dogecoin (DOGE) is “about to rip”.










On the largest memecoin by market cap, the widely followed analyst further says,
“DOGE always has been and always will be the king of the memes. All of retail is still familiar with it, and all of crypto Twitter was raised on it.
It was the initial meme that made it possible for us to believe that a dog and a community were enough to start a movement.
Dogecoin isn’t dead.
As soon as it starts to catch a bit of a bid, it will move vertical once again… It’s only a matter of time before it happens, and I refuse to be sidelined when it does.”
Dogecoin is trading at $0.152 at time of writing.
Turning to Bitcoin (BTC), Kaleo says he has a “feeling that it continues to do well from here.”
Source: Kaleo/X
Based on Kaleo’s chart, it appears that the pseudonymous analyst is projecting Bitcoin to rise to over $100,000 over the coming months.
Bitcoin is trading at $66,003 at time of writing.
Next up is Solana (SOL). According to the widely followed analyst, Solana will soar to a fresh all-time high this year.
Solana is trading at $173 at time of writing, down about 33% from its record high of $259.96.

Stablecoin Showdown: Tether vs. EU Regulations - Coin Edition


							

Kraken is considering delisting Tether’s USDT due to EU MiCA regulations.



Marcus Hughes, Kraken’s regulatory strategy head, confirms the review and potential action.



Tether CEO noted exchanges will focus on Euro liquidity while maintaining USDT transactions.




Kraken, a major cryptocurrency exchange, is contemplating the delisting of Tether’s USDT stablecoin from its European platform in response to upcoming regulations from the European Union. Marcus Hughes, Kraken’s global head of regulatory strategy, confirmed this possibility in a recent interview with Bloomberg.



The European Union is poised to implement a new regulatory framework for digital assets, known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), in July. This framework is expected to introduce stringent regulations for stablecoins, potentially impacting the status of USDT within the European market.



“We’re absolutely planning for all eventualities, including situations where it’s just not tenable to list specific tokens such as USDT,” stated Hughes. He elaborated that Kraken is conducting a thorough review of the situation and will make definitive decisions as the regulatory landscape becomes clearer.









In response to Kraken’s considerations, Tether, the issuer of USDT, highlighted its expectation that European exchanges will prioritize euro liquidity for their customers while still potentially using USDT as a bridge currency for entry and exit from the crypto market.



Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, has previously expressed reservations about certain aspects of MiCA’s requirements. While Tether is currently engaged in discussions with regulators, Ardoino has indicated that the company does not plan to comply with MiCA regulations in the immediate future.



Earlier this year, another cryptocurrency exchange, OKX, made adjustments to its support for USDT within the EU. While OKX users can still deposit, withdraw, and convert USDT to euros, they can no longer use it for trading other cryptocurrencies on the platform.



The European Banking Authority (EBA) is finalizing the technical specifications for MiCA, with full implementation anticipated by 2025. Notably, the new regulations will require stablecoin issuers to obtain licenses within at least one EU member state and adhere to more rigorous standards for governance and reserve management.



This impending regulatory shift in the European Union underscores the evolving landscape for stablecoins and cryptocurrency exchanges. Kraken’s potential delisting of USDT reflects the challenges posed by MiCA, while Tether’s stance indicates a potential clash between regulators and stablecoin issuers.



The coming months will be crucial in determining how the European market adapts to this new regulatory framework and its impact on the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Ethereum nears $3,200, jumps 10%: Bullish breakout ahead? - AMBCrypto



ETH wants to break above resistance.
The bulls supported the coin’s uptrend with a number of markers spotted on a daily chart. 

Leading altcoin Ethereum [ETH] is poised to breach the upper line of its descending channel, suggesting a decline in selling pressure.
At $3,100 at press time, the coin’s value has risen by almost 10% in the last week, according to CoinMarketCap. This growth mirrored the uptick in the general crypto market in the last seven days.
 According to CoinGecko, global cryptocurrency market capitalization has surged by 9% during that period.
Will ETH make it?
A descending channel is formed when an asset’s price continues to make lower highs and lower lows, indicating a broader downward trend. 
ETH began to trend within this channel on the 12th of March, causing its price to decline by 20% since then.
 With the coin making its way toward the upper line of the channel, which has formed a resistance level since March, the market witnessed a surge in new liquidity inflow.
Confirming this was ETH’s Chaikin Money Flow, which recently crossed above the zero line and was in an uptrend at press time. This indicator measures the flow of money into and out of the coin’s market. 
When an asset’s CMF climbs this way, it suggests more buying pressure than selling pressure in the market. This is often due to the asset’s price making new highs because of a surge in trading volume. 
In the last seven days, ETH’s daily trading volume has risen by 40%, per Santiment’s data.
Signaling the rise in bullish presence, ETH’s positive directional index (green) crossed above its negative index (red) on the 17th of May. 
Such readings made from an asset’s Directional Movement Index (DMI) indicate a bullish rise in the market.
Further, the value of the coin’s Elder-Ray Index was positive at press time.
Source: ETH/USDT on TradingView
This indicator measures the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers in the market. When it returns a positive value, it means that bull power dominates the market.  

Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25

Should ETH bulls succeed and break above the upper line of the descending channel, the coin’s next price point will be above $3200.

 However, if selling pressure mounts and a downtrend is initiated, the price is expected to fall to $2775 toward support.

7 Reasons Dogecoin (DOGE) Could Flip Ripple's XRP in 2024


																Dogecoin’s total market capitalization was $19.8 billion at the time of writing, with the hash work-powered meme currency trading at $0.145.
Meanwhile, Ripple XRP price moved markets at $0.5 per token, and its market cap stood at $27 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
The Ripple lawsuit versus the US SEC could be over as soon as this summer, according to one legal expert. That would be the end of an ongoing headwind for XRP and portend a rise in its fortunes.
But here are seven reasons why Dogecoin could flip Ripple’s market cap later this year with one or two little green candles.
1. Elon Musk






Dogecoin has Elon Musk. That’s such enormous credibility and publicity. Ripple needs a champion with a similar cachet to stay ahead of DOGE.
The closest it has so far is Gary Gensler. After all, the SEC Chairman’s fierce opposition to XRP signals to investors that it might be very disruptive in global finance and deliver big returns for the money invested.
DOGE traded for $0.003 a coin back in April 2019 when the Tesla and SpaceX leader tweeted, “Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool.” That’s a +4,600% gain for the OG meme coin in five years’ time for an average annualized return on investment of +920%.
2. Dogecoin Large Holders Inflows Up 582%
Dogecoin large holder inflows surged 582% in 24 hours on May 4, in a very bullish move for the asset. At the same time, Ripple whales are moving their XRP tokens onto exchanges in a bearish sign.
Crypto Daily Trade Signals, a popular Dogecoin YouTube channel, reported, “Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a substantial rise in Large Holders Inflow, soaring from 129.63 million DOGE to an impressive 754.75 million DOGE, equivalent to approximately $116.98 million.”


Meanwhile, XRP saw huge whale-sized moves onto exchanges in May. On the 5th, there was a transaction that pushed 28,240,000 XRP (worth 14,948,393 USD at the time) onto Bitstamp in a potentially bearish signal for Ripple’s token.
Then, on May 12th, another 30,230,000 worth of Ripple moved from an unknown wallet onto Bitstamp, according to Whale Alert data.
3. Tesla Adds Dogecoin For Payments
Tesla, Inc. has accepted Doge for years – for company beanie caps and t-shirts. This month, for the first time ever, the electric car maker began to accept DOGE payments for new cars and trucks. Very rad. Dogecoin surged by 21% following the introduction.
Musk said back in March that he thought Tesla should add support for Dogecoin payments.
XRP has some pretty wow partnerships, too, and continues to bring more corporate brands into the conspiracy. But many of these are with big foreign banks and governments. They will take many years to see fruition compared to the instant boost to the Doge economy’s network effects. Other companies that accept Doge include Microsoft, AMC, Twitch, and Newegg.
4. Much Meme Power
Simply put, Doge memes have enormous power on the Internet, especially in the nerdy tech quarter that has deep pockets to move markets.
Ripple is more like a TradFi bank than Doge, despite its decentralization, and probably doesn’t want a furry mascot to boost its popularity in the near term. Maybe that shouldn’t matter. But to crypto bros, it does.
2023’s top gainers were mostly meme coins. Q1 2024’s crypto leader was also a meme coin – PopCat.
5. Very Teamwork, Such Clout


Dogecoin’s peers are unstoppable!
The currency’s meme power has translated to real economic disruptions with many zeros and commas on them. Ethereum Shiba Inu (SHIB), Solana Bonk (BONK), DogWifHat (WIF), and Ethereum/Binance Floki Inu (FLOKI) have delivered altcoin investors world-class gains over the past 12 months.
New York City ETF fund manager VanEck just launched the MarketVector Meme Coin Index this month. Of the six currencies on the index, five are Doge memes.
6. Proof of Work Power
Even during periods like the past week, when meme coins have led losses among cryptos (after leading gains in the prior week), Doge’s price has staying power with its crypto mining/proof-of-work investors.
Dogecoin is a Dec. 2013 fork of the original Bitcoin blockchain launched in Jan. 2009. It operates in much the same way as the BTC network and investors choose it because its electricity requirement to participate helps prevent inflation and hold buying power.
Environmentalists who are weary of central bank currency are also leaning into PoW chains. Proof-of-Work has harnessed the digital economy to the petroleum/alternative energy industry. It’s the world’s biggest bounty for cheaper sources of electricity.


7. Fed Rate Cuts Later This Year
The Fed may hold rates steady in June, but the Bank of England could start the race to debt revaluation with rate cuts next month.
Many economists, analysts, and commentators still expect a Fed rate cut sometime later this year, especially if consumer price deflation continues to roll over to April and May.
Either way, after the recent $1.2 trillion spending bill in March to fund the U.S. government for six more months, Washington is pacing to spend $2.4 trillion annually. When that happens, it usually pushes prices up and seriously aggravates the crypto markets’ already voracious demand for inflation shelters like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.
Bottom Line for Investors
Digital assets are held at risk of loss, and there is no way to guarantee how markets will perform in the future. But, based on the fundamental considerations listed above, Dogecoin’s price could be undervalued at $0.14 after falling from its $0.22 peak in March.

Mintlayer Partners with Salus to Develop An L3 to Boost Bitcoin


Mintlayer, a Layer-2 protocol linked to Bitcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi), announced its partnership with Salus, a Web3 security services platform, to develop Thunder Network, a Layer-3 solution built on BTC. The new network promises scalability, improved privacy, and faster transaction speeds.
Thunder Network will allow to use Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) capabilities in a Bitcoin-connected application. Developers will also be able to create decentralized applications (DApps). 
Mintlayer and Salus Will develop “Thunder Network” On L3

The partnership marks a significant advancement in integrating Bitcoin with the blockchain ecosystem by incorporating L3 rollups with zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. Rollups are independent blockchains where users make transactions and send that data to Ethereum.
Mintlayer and Salus seek to provide Thunder Network with a fluid, high-performance, secure, and private user experience while maintaining Bitcoin‘s decentralization principles.

“Partnering with Salus is a significant milestone in Mintlayer’s mission to revolutionize Bitcoin’s scalability. Through integrating ZK, Thunder Network will enhance developers transaction speed and privacy while providing with powerful EVM capabilities to build applications on top of Bitcoin. “We’re excited to work with Salus to unlock Bitcoin’s full potential and drive the future of DeFi,” commented Enrico Rubboli, Mintlayer Founder.

Vitalik Buterin Addresses Major Concerns by Ethereum Community


Vitalik Buterin has published a new article outlining upcoming Ethereum improvements, particularly focusing on PeerDAS, the Verkle tree transition and decentralized methods for storing history as proposed in EIP-4444. Ethereum's founder emphasized the importance of decentralization, a key element of ETH's unique development strategy. He also addressed issues like Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) and the balance between minimizing and quarantining it.The article was inspired by a series of tweets from long-time Geth core developer Peter Szilagyi, who expressed concerns about MEV. Buterin noted that many of these concerns are already being addressed by ongoing protocol features and that additional issues can be resolved through realistic adjustments to the current road map.MEVButerin discussed Ethereum's approach to managing Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which emerged around 2020 when miners started using complex strategies to gain extra revenue from DeFi activities. This development compromised the fairness of block proposing, favoring larger actors.Two strategies address MEV: minimization and quarantining. MEV minimization involves creating alternatives like Cowswap and using encrypted mempools to reduce exploitable information.MEV quarantining accepts MEV but limits its impact by separating block proposing from content selection. Validators focus on proposing blocks, while specialized builders choose block contents via an auction protocol.Buterin supports a mix of both strategies, acknowledging that MEV will not disappear entirely and emphasizing the need to reduce the potential harm from builders to maintain decentralization.DecentralizationButerin also emphasized the importance of making Ethereum nodes accessible, a central issue in blockchain decentralization. He highlighted EIP-4444 and Verkle trees as key technologies to reduce node hardware requirements, potentially to under 100 gigabytes or even near-zero by offloading history storage.Source: Vitalik.eth.limoButerin acknowledged concerns about centralization if responsibility for state maintenance and proofs is offloaded, suggesting an alternative: storing old history in a peer-to-peer network where each node holds a small portion of the data. This would ensure robustness with thousands of copies and potentially use erasure coding for added reliability.He stressed that while Ethereum Layer 1 should support Layer 2 projects, it must maintain scalability and the unique properties that make Ethereum distinct, ensuring continued decentralization and security.

Retail Trading Legend Roaring Kitty Returns After Three Years-Can He Spark Another Frenzy? - Benzinga

Keith Gill, better known by his online aliases Roaring Kitty and DeepF**kingValue (DFV), has re-emerged on social media after a three-year hiatus.Gill, a former college track star turned financial analyst, became an unlikely hero during the epic GameStop GME/USD short squeeze of 2021.From College Track To Wall Street BetsBorn in Brockton, Massachusetts in 1986, Gill’s athletic prowess landed him All-America honors in college. However, his passion shifted towards the financial world. By 2019, Gill, convinced that GameStop stock was significantly undervalued, began sharing his analysis online. Under the handle Roaring Kitty on YouTube and Twitter, he streamed for hours, passionately explaining his bullish case on GME. The same year, he joined Reddit under the username DFV, initially investing $53,000 in the company.The Rise And Fall (And Rise?) Of A Meme StockGill’s conviction and detailed analysis resonated with a large community of retail investors, particularly on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets. As the pandemic raged and interest rates remained low, retail investor participation surged. Fuelled by Gill’s unwavering belief in GameStop’s potential, a buying frenzy ensued, sending the stock price soaring to a peak of $483 in early 2021. This meteoric rise turned Gill’s initial $53,000 investment into a staggering $48 million windfall.A Congressional Hearing And Legal BattlesThe GameStop saga attracted significant scrutiny. Gill testified before Congress in February 2021, reiterating his belief in the company’s fundamentals. He also faced a class-action lawsuit accusing him of market manipulation, which was ultimately dismissed.Also Read: Coinbase Says Ethereum ETF Approval More Likely Than You Think— Here’s WhyA Legend Returns – But Can He Repeat History?After his meteoric rise and subsequent disappearance from the online sphere, Gill’s recent return has sent shockwaves through the financial world. His simple tweet featuring a video game meme has reignited speculation about a potential return to the meme stock frenzy.Lessons Learned: Hype, Influencers, And The Power Of RetailThe GameStop story offers valuable lessons for today’s retail investors, particularly in the burgeoning crypto space. The event highlighted the power of online communities, influencer narratives and the unpredictable nature of markets fueled by hype.We’ve seen similar phenomena play out recently with certain popular meme coins like Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, where social media hype and celebrity endorsements sent their prices soaring – though not without significant volatility. While Gill’s return is undoubtedly significant, replicating the 2021 phenomenon might be difficult.The Road AheadAs retail investor influence continues to grow, especially in the crypto world, Gill’s story serves as a cautionary tale and a reminder of the importance of responsible investing. Whether Gill can spark another meme stock frenzy remains to be seen, but his return undeniably marks a new chapter in the saga of retail investor influence in the financial markets.Read Next: ‘I Will Be Going Full Tilt Vs The White House:’ Experts Urge Bipartisan Support For Sound Policies Because ‘Pro-Crypto Is Pro-American Values’

Feds bust $73M crypto scam, arrest two masterminds

United States authorities arrested two individuals accused of masterminding a money laundering scheme, which involved funneling over $73 million through U.S. financial institutions and ultimately converting the funds into Tether (USDT).The Justice Department announced on Friday that Daren Li, 41, was arrested at Atlanta’s airport on April 12, and Yicheng Zhang, 38, was taken into custody in Los Angeles on Thursday. An indictment charging the pair was unsealed in a California court on Thursday, revealing their alleged roles in the scheme.Li, Zhang, and their cohorts allegedly ran a transnational criminal network that laundered millions from ‘pig butchering’ crypto scams, where fraudsters gain victims’ trust, convince them to invest large sums, and then disappear with the funds.The defendants allegedly instructed co-conspirators to open U.S. bank accounts in the name of shell companies. The scammers convinced victims to transfer millions of dollars into these U.S. bank accounts, which were then used to launder the illicit funds. According to the Department of Justice, the money was subsequently dispersed to various domestic and international bank accounts. The DOJ said,“The fraud scheme involved more than $73 million laundered through U.S. financial institutions to bank accounts in the Bahamas and converted to the virtual asset USDT, or Tether. A cryptocurrency wallet involved in the scheme received more than $341 million in virtual assets.”Daren Li and Yicheng Zhang face charges of conspiring to launder money and six counts of international money laundering. If found guilty, they could receive a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment for each count, potentially totaling 140 years behind bars.Related: Tether freezes $5.2M in USDT linked to phishing scamsDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, in a statement, acknowledged the challenges posed by cryptocurrency fraud but affirmed the commitment to hold perpetrators accountable.Pig butchering scams have become lucrative for online criminals. In November 2023, the United States Justice Department seized $9 million from a scheme that preyed on more than 70 U.S. citizens. Due to its escalating frequency and severity, this type of scam has raised alarm bells among lawmakers and regulators in recent months.Regulators have heightened efforts to curb crypto scams and related incidents in the market. This can be seen in proposed regulations and industry guidelines rolled out by authorities. While efforts are hailed to protect investors and preserve digital assets, some regulations could become a stumbling block to the sector’s development.Magazine: U.S. enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime

Beyond Bitcoin: Hong Kong Approves Ethereum ETF - Coin Edition


							

OKLink feels Hong Kong could launch more L1 ETFs in the future.



Hong Kong eyes wider adoption for crypto assets  pen_spark.



PoS protocol seen as positive factor.




Following the recent launch of spot Ethereum ETF in Hong Kong, OkLink, a global leader in blockchain data services, expressed optimism about regulators approving similar products for other leading blockchain protocols in the future. The firm believes this move could enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a hub for crypto innovation compared to other regions with stricter regulations.



On April 30, Hong Kong became one of the first major financial centers to approve both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, albeit several months after the U.S. launched its first Bitcoin ETFs. While acknowledging the Ethereum ETF’s initial trading volume has fallen short of expectations, OKLink suggests the early launch provides a competitive advantage for Hong Kong’s crypto market.







This optimism partly stems from the perception that the SEC remains hesitant to approve Ethereum ETFs. OKLink anticipates a potential surge in investment into the Hong Kong ETF once the underlying Ethereum price recovers from its current decline.



The specific approval of an Ethereum ETF based on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism leads OKLink to believe similar products for other PoS protocols could be forthcoming. The firm identifies established public blockchains like Solana as potential beneficiaries of this trend, further bolstering Hong Kong’s attractiveness to various Web3 projects.









However, the current Hong Kong Ethereum ETF’s market share remains modest, accounting for just 15.11% of the region’s ETF market with approximately HK$327 million in assets under management. OKLink attributes this to the broader market downturn and the Ethereum protocol’s recent “Cancun” upgrade failing to deliver a significant boost to Layer 2 scaling solutions, as many had anticipated.



While the initial Hong Kong Ethereum ETF’s performance has been muted, the regulatory approval itself holds broader significance. It signifies a willingness to embrace innovation within a controlled framework, potentially paving the way for a more diverse and competitive landscape for crypto investment in Asia. This approach could be closely watched by other regional financial centers seeking to balance regulatory oversight with fostering the growth of the digital asset industry.

Bitcoin Price Prediction
As Bitcoin hovers near the $67,000 mark, trading at $67,243.75 with a recent upswing of 1.41%, questions about its next milestone intensify. With a trading volume of $24.62 billion and a dominant market cap of $1.32 trillion, the prevailing sentiment is cautiously optimistic, stirring discussions on Bitcoin price predictions for an imminent new high.
Bitcoin Price Prediction

Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish, as BTC’s pivot point is established at $66,680, which is pivotal in determining the direction of Bitcoin’s price movement. The immediate resistance level is observed at $69,296, and breaching this level could indicate potential gains ahead.Further resistance is identified at $71,090 and $72,809, with surpassing these levels possibly signaling strong bullish momentum and potentially setting new highs for the cryptocurrency.Conversely, immediate support is found at $64,662, with a fall below this level potentially leading to tests of further supports at $63,299 and $61,517.Bitcoin Price PredictionA decline beyond these points could increase selling pressure, driving the price downwards. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is noted to be at 68, nearing the overbought territory, suggesting a possible upcoming resistance or pullback as traders might start taking profits.Additionally, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $64,235, serving as a fundamental support level, which could be crucial if the price begins to retract, providing a potential rebound point for Bitcoin.Conclusion: Bitcoin’s current market position shows a bullish outlook above the pivot point of $66,680. However, traders should monitor the $64,662 support level closely, as a break below this could flip the bias to bearish. Conversely, maintaining above the pivot point could see Bitcoin testing upper resistance levels, particularly if it can sustain a break above $69,296.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Eyes Dramatic Rebound, One Obstacle Looms

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is eyeing a dramatic rebound in the market today as Bitcoin (BTC) returned to $67,000 for the first time in over three weeks. Shiba Inu is taking in some of the bullish sentiment, up by 10% over the trailing seven-day period to $0.00002499, per CoinMarketCap’s data. For Shiba Inu, the metrics are lit up with some contrasting bearish trends also appearing on-chain.SHIB 1D Chart. Source: CoinMarketCapShiba Inu has recorded a more or less wavy motion in the past 24 hours where its price has soared by 0.85%. The token has made several attempts to break past the $0.00002461 to $0.0000253 price range with no success.This is understandable considering the SHIB volume has remained relatively low, serving as a barrier to uplifting prices. Per current on-chain data, the major downturn is the token’s volume, which is down 36.76% to $407,626,780. With a reduced buying moment, it depicts bearish sentiment, one that might keep the prices below the $0.0000253 breakout point for much longer.Shiba Inu remains one of the most watched meme coins in the market. There have been several attempts to reclaim its spot in the top 10 list of digital currencies, but its generally bearish outlook in recent times has favored protocols like Toncoin more in this regard.Shiba Inu has made several headlines in the past with upgrades and milestones recorded on Shibarium, its Layer-2 scaling solution. From the hard fork of Shibarium to the long-awaited launch of ShibaSwap on the L2, the opportunities to beat the general market trend remain high.Shiba Inu whales have also shown readiness to help crunch the liquidity of the token in circulation. As reported earlier by U.Today, a Shiba Inu whale suddenly came back to life after three years to take in a profit worth $3.2 million.While many headwinds are on the horizon, SHIB aims to maintain its resilience around the $0.000025 mark.

Here are Bitcoin's new levels to watch as bulls prepare to break resistance


Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading with a bullish bias, with the cryptocurrency climbing to its highest point in over a month.
As the asset shows strength, the market remains on edge regarding the next move, especially if Bitcoin is primed to reclaim another record high.
In looking at the next Bitcoin price trajectory, crypto analyst RLinda pointed out in a TradingView post on May 18 that bulls are now ready to challenge Bitcoin resistance. According to the analyst, buyers have pushed Bitcoin’s price upward after successfully defending the $64,500-$65,000 support range, testing the resistance at $67,250.

She noted that the lack of a subsequent fall suggests a pre-breakdown consolidation. This indicates that bulls are accumulating positions with a breakout target in mind, preparing for a sustained upward movement.
Key levels to watch 
In the meantime, the analyst pointed out that with Bitcoin showing bullish momentum, key resistance levels to watch are $67,250, $71,500, and $73,700, while crucial support levels include $65,250, $64,500, and $61,500. 
Notably, the high interest from investors and a favorable fundamental background could significantly strengthen the price. The analysis suggests that breaking through these resistance levels could pave the way for continued bullish momentum.

“Bitcoin looks quite bullish right now. High interest, favorable fundamental background can affect the strengthening of the price. At the moment, it is worth paying attention to these levels, the breakthrough of which may give a continuation of the movement, the targets are indicated on the chart,” the expert said. 

Overall, RLinda noted that based on Bitcoin’s local timeframe, there is an indication of the end of a locational correction and the beginning of a potentially significant third-wave formation.
Additionally, the analyst pointed out that Bitcoin is undergoing consolidation with substantial volumes accumulated by strong buyers. This consolidation phase is crucial as it could transition into a distribution phase, further propelling the bullish trend if buyers remain persistent.
It’s worth noting that Bitcoin’s ongoing bullish momentum follows the April CPI release, which showed inflation slowed and data indicating increasing retail and institutional interest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This signals a steady recovery for Bitcoin after it started May in a red zone, dropping as low as $56,000.
Bitcoin price analysis
At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $67,290, with daily gains of 1%. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin is up almost 11%.

Elsewhere, Bitcoin’s technical indicators point to a bullish sentiment. A summary of the one-day gauges retrieved from TradingView aligns with the ‘buy’ sentiment at 15. Moving averages indicate a ‘strong buy’ at 13 while oscillators remain ‘neutral’ at 8.

Indeed, Bitcoin is gearing up to hit another record high, a milestone that can be realized if the cryptocurrency can reclaim $70,000.

Top-50 Solana-Based Altcoin Primed for a ‘Much Higher’ Price, According to Crypto Trader - Here’s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist believes one Top-50 artificial intelligence (AI)-related altcoin is preparing to witness big rallies in the coming months.
Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 215,400 followers on the social media platform X that Render (RNDR), a project related to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), will likely hold a range low as support.










“RNDR: expecting this area to hold. $10 is a bargain. Expecting much higher prices in the coming months. I’m in this again.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Looking at his chart, the trader suggests the level around $10 is the bottom of a trading range with an upper bound of $12.72.
Render is trading for $10.13 at time of writing. The 30th-ranked Solana (SOL)-based crypto is up more than 1% in the last 24 hours.
Next, the analyst says Bitcoin (BTC) appears bullish in the short term but is waiting for BTC to hit higher price targets to confirm upward momentum.
“BTC: [the coin’s range equilibrium] EQ is generally not where you want to open fresh longs in my opinion, wait for more clarity. Looks ok in the short term though.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Bitcoin is trading for $67,036 at time of writing, up more than 2% in the last 24 hours.
The analyst is also watching the price action of Ethereum (ETH), warning that the top altcoin is currently facing resistance at a key level amid declining investor sentiment.
“ETH: chart-wise, I don’t see much reason to buy it. Support/resistance level resistance, 200-day exponential moving average resistance, etc. Plus, sentiment is horrid and ETH holders have been sitting bitterly while the rest of the market has done pretty well. I put myself in this group, which means it’s probably time to buy?”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Ethereum is trading for $3,104 at time of writing, up 5.19% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, the analyst says he is long-term bullish on ETH competitor Solana.
“SOL: looks good for higher but need to see more follow-up after a break from this range at $120-$150. One month chop/consolidation was healthy for this chart and I still think that you should try to accumulate this one as much as you can.”

Solana is trading for $171 at time of writing, up 6.43% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin pool mines seven blocks in a row, raises security concerns


Antpool, the second-largest Bitcoin (BTC) mining pool, mined seven blocks in a row on May 17, raising security concerns. The seven-block sequence confirmed 20,686 transactions, rendering over 23 BTC, worth around $1.54 million, in revenue.
In particular, the event happened between block heights 843,898 and 843,904 and lasted one hour and 38 minutes. According to mempool. space data, Antpool collected 1.283 BTC in fees, plus 21.875 BTC from the block subsidy.

Interestingly, Foundry USA, the largest Bitcoin mining pool, mined the previous block of this sequence and the two next blocks. This makes a sequence of 10 blocks mined by two companies, challenging the decentralization and security of the leading cryptocurrency.


The Public Pool account raised the security concern in a post on X.

Bitcoin mining pool centralization and security concerns
Essentially, the proof-of-work consensus mechanism Bitcoin uses establishes a round leader to add transactions to a block and broadcast this block to the network peers, who will add it to their ledger. The leader is the miner who finds the next valid block according to the hashrate each miner produces.
Bitcoin’s security premise lies in the idea that different entities that do not know each other will find different blocks. This prevents a malicious actor from spending the same coin twice or adding an invalid transaction to the blockchain.
Moreover, having multiple miners competing equally diminishes the chances of a “chain reorg.” The reorganization excludes blocks from the blockchain and could revert confirmed transactions—as if they never existed.
Bitcoin mining pools are considered a single entity despite having multiple miners working for them because the pool coordinator manages the contributed hashrate, adds transactions to blocks, broadcasts blocks to the network, and pays the contributing miners accordingly.
Who is Antpool?
Antpool is a Chinese company subsidiary of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining equipment producer, Bitmain. In November 2023, the company raised controversy in the Bitcoin community by arbitrarily refunding an 83 BTC fee.
Notably, the pool has mined 25.48% of all blocks in the last seven days. It loses only to Foundry USA, with 31.12% of the network’s hashrate—both with a 56.6% mining dominance. In October 2023, Antpool briefly challenged Foundry’s leadership for three days.

In this context, a Bitcoin developer believes transactions should wait at least two hours before being considered secure. This is because the more subsequent blocks after the one carrying a transaction, the lower the chances of a chain reorg and the more probable a transaction is to reach finality.
Antpool’s recent seven-block sequence demonstrates that the developer’s concerns are real and should be considered.

XRP Ledger: Transaction Surge vs. Declining Wallet Creation - Coin Edition


							

XRP Ledger transactions surge 108%.



Transaction fees on XRPL drop 45%.



XRP price dips despite activity rise.




The XRP Ledger (XRPL) experienced a significant increase in transaction volume and a decrease in transaction fees during the first quarter of 2024, according to a report released by Ripple.



The report details that XRPL transactions surged by 108%, reaching 251.4 million in Q1 2024, compared to 121 million in the final quarter of 2023. Notably, this rise in transaction volume coincided with a 45% decline in the average transaction fee, falling from $0.001546 in Q4 2023 to $0.000856 by the end of March 2024.







The report attributes the decrease in fees to a return to normal activity levels on the XRPL without network congestion in Q1 2024. A spike in December 2023 due to testing on the ledger had previously contributed to higher fees.



While the report highlights positive on-chain metrics, such as a 5% increase in trading volume on the XRPL’s native Decentralized EXchange (DEX) and a doubling in the amount of XRP burned for transaction fees, it also acknowledges a decline in the creation of new XRP wallets. The number of new wallets established in Q1 2024 dropped by 11% compared to the previous quarter.









Analysts at Vet, an XRPL decentralized oracle network (dUNL) validator, suggest that the discrepancy between the slower growth in new wallets and the surge in transactions could indicate increased activity from existing users.



Despite the positive on-chain developments, the market value of XRP declined by 5% quarter-over-quarter, with the average price falling from $0.59 in Q4 2023 to $0.56 by the end of March 2024. The report also details changes in Ripple’s XRP holdings, with spendable XRP decreasing from 5.07 billion to 4.84 billion and escrowed XRP dropping from 40.7 billion to 40.1 billion between the end of 2023 and Q1 2024.



While the XRP Ledger’s Q1 performance reflects a surge in activity and a more efficient network, the decline in the price of XRP and the slowdown in new wallet creation raise questions about broader market adoption. The coming months will be crucial in determining whether these positive on-chain metrics translate into sustained growth for the XRP ecosystem.

Data from Coinglass showed that Cardano’s open interest (OI) also gained 8.44%, equivalent to $246.79 million. The highest OI was on May 4, reaching $588 million.
The community supported Cardano’s positive figures, with opinions such as “we are back.” Some traders attribute the boom to the announcement of the smart contract update and Hoskinson‘s constant encouraging messages about the progress promised for June.

“However, the community’s reaction is mixed. While the recent developments have sparked excitement and hope for ADA’s future, there is also a palpable sense of frustration and skepticism. Many members recall past predictions that didn’t materialize as expected, and the current market dynamics add to their cautious outlook,” user added.

ADA has shown significant movement these weeks. Recently, the Cardano Foundation, based in Zug, Switzerland, announced the appointment of Giorgio Zinetti as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO). This announcement indicated the project was preparing for growth and innovation.

Additionally, the Cardano Treasury announced the accumulation of 1.5 billion ADA tokens, worth over $720 million, making up more than 4% of the circulating supply. This accumulation allows the organization to propose and vote on projects eligible for Treasury funding.
In March, Cardano introduced its first USD-pegged fully fiat-backed stablecoin, USDM. This new entrant aims to secure a foothold in the competitive $160 billion stablecoin market, predominantly led by Tether and Circle.

BitConnect Promoter Pleads Guilty in Australia - Coin Edition


							

Australian man pleads guilty for promoting defunct crypto platform.



Promoted unlicensed crypto schemes.



Promised high-yield returns out of a defunct platform.




John Bigatton, a resident of Carss Park, New South Wales, pleaded guilty on Thursday in the Sydney District Court to a charge of providing unlicensed financial services. The charge relates to his promotion of BitConnect, a defunct cryptocurrency platform that offered a high-yield investment program (HYIP).



Prosecutors allege that BitConnect operated as a ponzi scheme, attracting investors with promises of exorbitant returns on their cryptocurrency holdings. Bigatton, according to the court, admitted to promoting BitConnect’s “Lending Platform” which required users to invest in the platform’s native token, BCC, in exchange for guaranteed interest rates.









The court documents further detail that Bigatton promoted BitConnect through various means, including social media posts and seminars held across Australia. He allegedly engaged in face-to-face meetings with potential investors, persuading them to participate in the program.



Significantly, Bigatton did not possess the necessary Australian Financial Services (AFS) license to offer financial services. The court found that his promotional activities violated Section 911B(1) of the Corporations Act.



The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) investigated Bigatton’s activities and referred the case for prosecution. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) is handling the case. As part of a plea bargain, a separate charge of operating an unregistered managed investment scheme was withdrawn.



Bigatton’s sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 5, 2024.

Top 10 Fastest Blockchains by Maximum Daily Average TPS | Cryptopolitan

Coingecko analyzed blockchain performances and compiled a list of the fastest blockchains. The study revealed that Solana, SUI, and BSC chains were the fastest chains among large blockchains. The study revealed that most non-EVM blockchains are relatively faster than EVM-based ones. Solana, SUI, and Binance Smart Chain topped the list, followed closely by Ton and NEAR protocol.Also Read: Sui Network Clarifies Information on Its TokenomicsThe fastest blockchain on the list reached a record high of 1,054 daily average transactions per second (TPS). The slowest one at number 10, Gnosis, recorded 65.6 transactions per second. According to the study, the top 10 fastest chains include;Solana(1053.7)Sui(854.1)BSC(378.3)Polygon(190.4)TON(175.5)Tron(159.6)Near(117.8)Avalanche(89.2)Cronos(72.2)Gnosis(65.6)Solana Blockchain Records Fastest TPSThe Solana blockchain recorded the fastest TPS of all blockchain networks, making it the only network that can practically handle over 1000 TPS. On average, the daily average transactions per second on Solana reached a record high of 1,504 during the study.Although Solana took the top spot, its network has significantly underperformed compared to its theoretical potential. By the books, Solana can achieve a maximum speed of 65,000 TPS. In contrast, the chain only achieved about 1.6% of its theoretical potential.Non-EVM Beats EVM-Based chainsThe study also revealed that non-EVM-based blockchains are relatively faster than their counterparts.  The first two chains on the top 10 list are non-EVM and are closely tailed by other non-EVM chains like TON and Near Protocol. Bitcoin, among the slowest non-EVM chains, with 11 TPS, while Thorchain recorded 2 TPS.Also Read: Kaspa (Kas) Sets out to Become the Fastest Blockchain: Why Is This Project Running HotEVM chains also faired well in this analysis, with significant disparities visible at the bottom end of the ranking. BNB Smart Chain and Polygon emerged as the fasted EVM chains.

Solana (SOL) Ranked Fastest Blockchain: Details


According to a recent CoinGecko report, Solana is the fastest blockchain in the world at the moment. In a single day, the network processed over 95 million transactions.The report from CoinGecko revealed that Solana boasts the highest daily average transactions per second (TPS) among blockchains, clocking in at 1,053 TPS. Sui follows with 854 TPS, then BSC at 378 TPS, Polygon at 190 TPS, TON at 175 TPS, Tron at 159 TPS, Near at 117 TPS and Avalanche at 89 TPS.Source: CoinGeckoIn contrast, Ethereum handles 22.8 TPS and Bitcoin manages 10.7 TPS, indicating that non-EVM blockchains are nearly four times faster on average compared to their EVM-compatible counterparts.Solana's peak performance was particularly notable, reaching 1,504 TPS on April 6, 2023, due to a surge in meme coin transactions. This performance is 46 times higher than Ethereum's TPS and over five times higher than Polygon's, the fastest among Ethereum scaling solutions.However, despite these impressive figures, Solana's peak TPS is still only 1.6% of its theoretical maximum of 65,000 TPS.Solana is an open-source blockchain platform that prioritizes minimizing latency and maximizing throughput, even at the expense of some verifiability. It achieves this through a unique set of features, including its novel timestamp mechanism called proof of history (PoH), the block propagation protocol Turbine and parallel transaction processing.
According to Solana's founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, the primary design goal of Solana was not to achieve maximum throughput. Instead, Solana aims to synchronize state across the globe as swiftly as physical laws permit.

Giant Whale Takes Huge Loss on Altcoin, Losing Half Its Value Since January: Yet It Bought More Today - Bitcoin Sistemi


Experts from the cryptocurrency analysis platform Lookonchain have detected advanced whale activity in some altcoins in recent hours.
According to the statement made by analysts, a cryptocurrency whale bought $ 4.3 million Arbitrum (ARB) token hours ago. The last purchase was at an average price of $1.03. This whale has been involved in Arbitrum trading since July 18, 2023.


According to the data, the whale wallet had purchased a total of 39 million ARBs at an average price of $ 1.25, paying $ 49 million so far. However, this whale has sold 37.5 million ARBs on the Arbitrum trade so far at an average price of $1.2, making a total of $44.9 million.
So this whale actually lost more than $2 million from ARB trading.






The whale currently has 5.98 million ARB worth $6.15 million. At the time of this writing, the ARB price is trading at $1.03.
Arbitrum reached its all-time high, reaching $2.40 in January 2024. At the time of writing this article, it is trading at a level 57% lower than its all-time high price level.

Hedge Funds Lead Bitcoin ETF Investment Surge


The institutional fervor surrounding Bitcoin (BTC) has surged to unprecedented heights, as evidenced by the recent 13F filings presented by major financial institutions to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
According to data from CoinShares, there are currently more than 1,900 holders of US ETFs, and the average BTC allocation in portfolios is 0.6%.
Hedge Funds Aping Into Bitcoin

Further insights into professional investment firms unveil a growing affinity for Bitcoin, with hedge funds leading the charge. On average, hedge funds allocate 2.1% of their portfolios to the flagship digital asset, while private equity firms and holding companies follow suit with 1.5% and 1%, respectively.
Backing this trend, Sam Baker, an analyst at crypto brokerage firm River, highlights that 52% of the top 25 US hedge funds have ventured into this investment product. These hedge fund investments exhibit a wide spectrum, ranging from Millenium Management’s significant holding of 27,263 BTC to Bluecrest Capital Management’s more modest 8 BTC allocation.
BeInCrypto reported that Millennium invested approximately $2 billion in ETF products, with notable investments of $844.2 million in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), $806.7 million in Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and substantial sums in other prominent ETFs.

Indeed, the interest in BTC ETFs has remained resilient despite the outflows in April. Available data shows that inflows into the ETFs this month have compensated for the previous month’s setbacks. This week, over $1 billion worth of BTC were purchased by ETFs, propelling their total Bitcoin holdings to a new record high.

“The Bitcoin ETFs have put together a solid two weeks with $1.3 billion in inflows, which offsets the entirety of the negative flows in April—putting them back around high water mark of +$12.3 billion net since launch. This key number IMO bc it nets out inflows and outflows (which are normal),” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said.


However, amidst this ETF fervor, on-chain Bitcoin transactions depict a subdued landscape, marked by dwindling transaction volumes. According to IntoTheBlock data, the 7-day average for new BTC addresses plummeted to 276,000 last week, hitting its lowest point since July 2018.

“Is this because ETFs are acting as a proxy for new users? Are people moving off-chain? Or is there simply a lack of new entrants in the market?” analysts at IntoTheBlock questioned.

Nevertheless, experts opine that the tepid on-chain activity may not necessarily signal bearish sentiment. It’s plausible that a growing number of newcomers are turning to ETFs as a preferred avenue for Bitcoin exposure.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



An insider from the X and Dogecoin teams who signs his messages as “DogeDesigner” on the X platform (@cb_doge) has revealed that the X Payments service is expected to launch later in 2024.The Dogecoin army immediately responded to that tweet along with non-crypto users — both are looking forward to the release of this much-anticipated feature on Elon Musk’s popular “free speech” platform. Elon Musk does not confirm plans to add DOGE to X so farThis is not the first announcement made by @cb_doge this year by far. Each time, the crypto community, with many DOGE-themed accounts among them, has reacted to them with a large wave of enthusiasm as they hope to finally see their beloved meme cryptocurrency to be finally integrated into the platform.Still, the celebratory X owner Elon Musk has not made any statements about the future of DOGE as an official currency of X yet. But that does not discourage the DOGE army anyway.What Musk did confirm several times, making it “super clear,” is that neither X nor any other of his companies plan to create their native cryptocurrencies. That was Musk’s response to multiple scams, offering “X coin” to unaware and enthusiastic investors and rumors about plans for such a cryptocurrency to be built and released in the future. This is likely to do with the current witch-hunt that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is leading against altcoins and various crypto wallets and crypto exchanges that list them for trading.DOGE army's hard-to-kill hopeIn the meanwhile, X Corporation continues to secure licenses that will allow it to process payments in various U.S. states, including, curiously, payments conducted in cryptocurrencies.Therefore, the hopes of the Dogecoin army seem to be based on pure hopes that Elon Musk will eventually confirm his status of DOGE lover and make this OG meme crypto one of the payment options on his social media network.

Binance Develops Antidote to Combat Growing Address Poisoning Scams



                    

Binance’s security experts have developed an “antidote” against the increasing threat of address poisoning scams, which trick investors into sending funds to fraudulent addresses.



The security team at the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange created an algorithm that has detected millions of poisoned crypto addresses, as reported to Cointelegraph:




“We have developed a unique method of identifying poisoned addresses, which helps us to alert users before they send money to criminals and was instrumental in identifying and flagging more than 13.4 million spoofed addresses on BNB Smart Chain and 1.68 million on Ethereum.”



Address poisoning, also known as address spoofing, involves scammers sending a small amount of digital assets to a wallet that closely resembles the victim’s address. 



This transaction becomes part of the wallet’s history, leading the victim to accidentally copy and send funds to the scammer’s address.




Binance’s algorithm detects these spoofed addresses by identifying suspicious transfers—typically those with near-zero value or unknown tokens—linking them to potential victim addresses, and timestamping malicious transactions to pinpoint the time of poisoning.



These spoofed addresses are logged in the database of Web3 security firm HashDit, Binance’s security partner, enhancing the protection of the broader crypto industry from such scams. According to Binance’s report:



“Many cryptocurrency service providers use HashDit’s API to boost their defenses against a variety of scams. 



READ MORE: Unknown Trader Nets $46 Million from Pepe Memecoin Amidst Resurgent GameStop Hype




“One of them, for example, is Trust Wallet, which uses the database of poisoned addresses to alert users when they are about to transfer funds to a spoofed recipient.”



The algorithm also flags spoofed addresses on HashDit’s user-facing products, web browser extensions, and MetaMask Snaps.



The necessity for this preventive algorithm became evident two weeks ago after an unknown trader lost $68 million to an address-poisoning scam. On May 3, they accidentally sent $68 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) to a spoofed address. 



Remarkably, the thief returned the $68 million on May 13, after on-chain investigators traced his potential Hong Kong-based IP addresses. 



This incident suggests the scammer panicked due to the public attention following the scam.



Address poisoning scams might seem avoidable, but most traders only verify the first and last digits of the wallet’s 42 alphanumeric characters. 



Scammers exploit this by using vanity address generators to create addresses that look similar. As Binance explains:



“An authentic Ethereum address like 0x19x30f…62657 could be spoofed using a similar-looking 0x19x30t…72657, which can be totally different in the middle while maintaining the first and last few characters.”

SEC's Policy Director Steps Down Amid Ongoing Crypto Scrutiny - Coin Edition


							

Heather Slavkin Corzo resigns as SEC policy director, replaced by Corey Klemmer.



Corzo credited with significant regulatory advancements during her tenure.



Continuity in SEC’s skeptical stance on cryptocurrencies expected.




Heather Slavkin Corzo, a prominent critic of cryptocurrencies, is stepping down from her role as policy director at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulatory body announced in a statement on Friday.



SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who appointed Corzo in April 2021, credited her with significant contributions to regulatory advancements.



During her tenure, Corzo played a pivotal role in implementing market fund reforms, accelerating the securities settlement cycle, and enhancing corporate disclosures regarding cybersecurity incidents. These measures have been praised for bolstering investor protections and streamlining capital formation processes.



Chair Gensler commended Corzo, describing her as one of his “most trusted advisers.” Her departure signifies the conclusion of a notable chapter for the SEC, as she was one of Gensler’s initial appointees upon his assumption of the agency’s leadership.



Before joining the SEC, Corzo served as the director of capital market policy at the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.









The SEC has announced that Corey Klemmer, who joined the agency in July 2021 as corporation finance counsel, will succeed Corzo. Despite this transition, no changes in the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation are anticipated. Both Corzo and Klemmer have expressed skepticism about digital assets, according to Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett.







This continuity in policy perspective comes as the SEC is embroiled in legal battles with major players in the crypto industry, such as Ripple and Coinbase. The agency’s stance has faced challenges, including the recent Senate rejection of its anti-crypto SAB 121 guidance.

AI safety researchers leave OpenAI over prioritization concerns

The entire OpenAI team focused on the existential dangers of AI have either resigned or been reportedly absorbed into other research groups.Days after Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI’s chief scientist and one of the company’s co-founders, announced his departure, Jan Leike, the former DeepMind researcher who was OpenAI’s super alignment team’s other co-lead, posted on X that he had resigned.According to Leike, his departure from the company was due to his worries about its priorities, which he thinks are more focused on product development than AI safety.Source: Jan LeikeLeike, in a series of posts, stated that the OpenAI leadership was wrong in their choice of core priorities and should emphasize safety and preparedness as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) development moves forward.AGI is a term for a hypothetical artificial intelligence that can perform the same as or better than humans on a range of tasks.After spending three years at OpenAI, Leike criticized the company for prioritizing developing flashy products over nurturing a robust AI safety culture and processes. He emphasized the urgent need for resource allocation, particularly computing power, to support his team’s vital safety research, which was being overlooked.“...I have been disagreeing with OpenAI leadership about the company’s core priorities for quite some time until we finally reached a breaking point. Over the past few months, my team has been sailing against the wind…”OpenAI formed a new research team in July last year to prepare for the emergence of extremely intelligent artificial intelligence that could outsmart and overpower its creators. OpenAI’s chief scientist and co-founder, Ilya Sutskever, was appointed co-lead of this new team, which received 20% of OpenAI’s computational resources.Related: Reddit shares jump after-hours on OpenAI data-sharing dealFollowing the recent resignations, OpenAI has opted to dissolve the ‘Superalignment’ team and integrate its functions into other research projects within the organization. This decision is reportedly a consequence of the ongoing internal restructuring, which was initiated in response to the governance crisis in November 2023. Sutskever was part of an effort that successfully saw OpenAI’s board briefly push out Altman as CEO in November last year before he was later rehired to the role after backlash from employees.According to The Information, Sutskever informed employees that the board’s decision to remove Sam Altman fulfilled their responsibility to guarantee that OpenAI develops AGI that benefits all of humanity. As one of the six board members, Sutskever emphasized the board’s commitment to aligning OpenAI’s goals with the greater good.Magazine: How to get better crypto predictions from ChatGPT, Humane AI pin slammed: AI Eye

We asked ChatGPT-4o what will be Solana price at the end of 2024; Here’s what it said


Solana (SOL) is again targeting the $200 mark as the token maintains bullish momentum amid a flurry of activities on the decentralized finance (DeFi) network.
At the moment, Solana is experiencing a bullish bias, surging over 30% in the past month. Recognizing the significance of this movement, Finbold sought insights from ChatGPT-4o, the latest and most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot model developed by OpenAI, to decipher SOL’s next trajectory.
Notably, ChatGPT-4o exhibits more accurate, faster, and cost-effective outcomes than other models.


In determining SOL’s future trajectory, the AI platform identified key factors likely to its valuation through 2024. It highlighted Solana’s popularity among meme coin traders, potentially boosting its value as SOL is utilized for transaction fees and as a counter pair. Additionally, it noted advantages such as Solana’s high throughput and low transaction costs.
ChatGPT-4o also observed that positive regulatory developments, market sentiment, and technological advancements could support price increases. Conversely, negative regulations might suppress Solana’s value.
Solana price prediction 
Given these influences, ChatGPT-4o outlined three potential scenarios for Solana’s price by the end of 2024. Assuming Solana maintains its current level of popularity and experiences steady, but not explosive, growth, the tool suggested a price range of $200 to $250. This estimate reflects a moderate increase from the current price. 
In a best-case scenario, where market conditions are highly favorable, the adoption of Solana increases significantly, and there are no significant setbacks; the AI tool predicted that Solana’s price could exceed $300.
On the downside, if the market turns bearish or Solana encounters significant challenges, its price could fall below $175.

It’s worth noting that despite encountering significant challenges in 2024, Solana’s projection largely remains bullish. In particular, SOL faced a potential loss of investor interest after the project suffered one of the most significant network outages.
SOL’s resilience
However, Solana has exhibited resilience as SOL’s value rose partly due to the popularity of meme coins launched on the network. Overall, Solana has been one of the leading platforms to record a significant launch of tokens.
As reported by Finbold on May 15, Solana recorded the creation of 643,227 new tokens within 30 days. Out of these tokens, 466,914 were memecoins. Notably, these coins seek to emulate the popularity of other Solana-based tokens, such as Bonk (BONK).
With the current momentum, some market players believe that SOL will soon be primed for a new record high. For instance, in an X post on May 17, Daniel Choung, co-founder of Syncracy Capital, a digital asset hedge fund, acknowledged Solana’s strong performance, noting that the token is on track to reclaim the $200 mark en route to a new record high.

Solana price analysis
By press time, Solana was trading at $173.45, representing daily gains of over 3%. On the weekly chart, Solana is up over 20%.

In the meantime, SOL investors will hope the token sustains the current bullish momentum and reclaims $200, which will act as an anchor to a new record high.

Layer-3s are the future of scalability - Blockworks


As the blockchain ecosystem grows, so does the demand for flexible, customizable tech.
Scalability is about making technology more accessible to Web3 builders and consumers. If developers can build scalable applications, they can reach more users without increasing their costs significantly or needing to multiply their resources. For those wishing to bootstrap a chain with limited resources, layer-3s could serve as a promising opportunity.
By cutting down on overhead operational and onboarding costs, layer-3s are quickly becoming an important piece of the blockchain ecosystem to give developers greater flexibility and growth opportunities. 
When layer-3s started trending, they were met with initial skepticism. Building on top of a layer-2 could add complexity and unnecessary fragmentation, and adding more layers could make the ecosystem of apps more challenging to navigate, leading to a lack of interoperability. 
But as more use cases emerge, the clearer it becomes: Layer-3s can lower barriers to entry for new chains and lower onboarding costs for users with minimal security tradeoffs. 
The accessibility of layer-3s 
Data availability costs continue to drop with increases in blob size and alternative data availability layers. The cost to operate a chain then increasingly becomes the cost to submit data commitments and state roots for withdrawals. 
The fixed overhead cost to operate a layer-3 is thus significantly less than the fixed overhead cost to operate a layer-2. Submitting data commitments and output roots to a layer-2 is significantly less expensive than the cost to submit those same transactions to Ethereum Mainnet. 
Additionally, when a layer-2 chain is newly launched, depositing tokens into that chain as a new user can be expensive. It requires both acquiring tokens on the layer-1 and then depositing those tokens from layer-1 to layer-2 — a total of two layer-1 transactions. During Ethereum Mainnet fee spikes, we’ve seen these transactions get prohibitively expensive for new users. With a layer-3, onboarding for a new user will only be two layer-2 transactions, which is a small fraction of the cost.
Read more from our opinion section: The most important trend in crypto? It’s always been memecoins
This presents application developers and chain operators with new, more cost-effective options to bootstrap usage and onboard new users.
We’re already seeing this trend with Base as an example; the chain has driven outsized demand and has expanded support for layer-3s building on top of it.
The entire blockchain ecosystem can benefit from layer-2’s commitment to the burgeoning layer-3 ecosystem, with even more developers able to leverage the power of layer-2 tech stacks. 
Key features fueling the rise of layer-3s 
From my vantage point, demand for layer-3s is surging and two features have quickly become the most highly requested. 
The first is custom gas tokens, which allow developers to use a layer-2 token as the native gas token for a layer-3. Custom gas tokens are great for community development — if there’s an existing community rallied around a layer-2 token, using it as the native token to pay for gas is a concrete next step towards building an ecosystem. Custom gas tokens can enable new use cases like in-game currencies for gaming ecosystem chains and token grants which directly subsidize developer and user fees
The second sought-after feature is alternative data availability, or alt-DA. This gives developers the option to select the DA layer of their choosing, greatly reducing transaction costs with the goal of minimizing security tradeoffs. 
Combining a layer-3 with alt-DA can give developers low overhead costs to post to the layer-2. This is in addition to sustainably low data availability costs, all adding up to the cheapest possible deployment of a layer-2 tech stack.  
As layer-3s gain momentum, I expect many of these chains to launch with both custom gas tokens and alt-DA. 
Powering the layer-3 future 
Developers have more options than ever before, and it’s “choose your own adventure” when it comes to deploying a layer-2 or layer-3. All have their pros and cons, and there’s room for all to succeed. 
While deploying a standard configuration, layer-2s will always be the most battle-tested, forward compatible way to launch a chain. However, layer-3s increase the accessibility of launching a new chain with ultra low cost. I see key features like custom gas tokens and alt-DA as important to the growth and adoption of layer-3s, which are in turn important for driving innovation forward with a shared vision for scaling Web3.

Bitcoin surge incoming? Tether mints another $1 billion USDT


Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, has minted an additional 1 billion USDT through its treasury. 
This minting has sparked significant discussion within the cryptocurrency community about its potential impact on the market, particularly for Bitcoin (BTC). 
Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, clarified on X (formerly Twitter) that this issuance was for “inventory replenishment” and was an “authorized but not issued transaction.”



Market dynamics and historical context
The latest minting follows Tether’s previous issuance on April 16, which occurred during a period of market liquidity drain. 
Over the past year, Tether’s treasury has minted a substantial 31 billion USDT across the Tron (TRX) and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains, according to the on-chain analytical platform Lookonchain.

Historically, these issuances have correlated with upward movements in Bitcoin’s price, suggesting that the new USDT could again influence Bitcoin’s market performance.
According to CryptoQuant, a recent surge in stablecoin inflows has been observed, indicating a notable increase in liquidity entering the cryptocurrency market. This influx of liquidity has the potential to influence the supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin, potentially leading to heightened price volatility.
Lookonchain’s analysis noted that last year’s significant USDT mintings contributed to Bitcoin’s price surge, pushing it from $27,000 to the $73,000 mark. This past pattern fuels speculation that the latest minting could similarly drive Bitcoin’s price upwards.
Current market conditions

Bitcoin is currently trading with a bullish bias at $66,000. Despite these potentially bullish indicators, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between $64,000 and $66,000. 
With Tether’s market capitalization now exceeding $110 billion, this new minting could act as a catalyst for Bitcoin to achieve new all-time highs.
On March 31, Tether acquired 8,888 BTC worth $618 million, elevating it to the position of the seventh-largest Bitcoin holder globally, according to Bitinfocharts. Currently, Tether’s wallet holds over 78,317 BTC, valued at over $5.18 billion, reflecting its significant influence on the market.
Bitcoin’s ongoing bullish momentum follows the April CPI release, signaling a steady recovery after starting May in a red zone and dropping as low as $56,000.
A Bitcoin correction to below $63,500 would liquidate over $1.76 billion worth of cumulative leveraged long positions, according to Coinglass data. Liquidations would reach $1.87 billion under the $63,000 mark.
As the cryptocurrency market anticipates the potential effects of Tether’s latest USDT minting, the interplay between stablecoin liquidity and Bitcoin’s price movement continues to be a focal point for investors.
With historical trends suggesting a positive correlation, market participants are watching closely to see if this latest minting will propel Bitcoin to new heights

How to Purchase Bitcoin on DEX via any Stablecoin on Any Network?

The demand for Bitcoin has been steadily rising which is being driven by its growing mainstream adoption and the appeal of its decentralized nature. The emergence of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) and stablecoins gave hope to investors and changed the way users can acquire Bitcoin offering a more accessible approach.
DEXs, however, for years faced challenges when it came to purchasing bitcoin using a stablecoin on any network. While stablecoins have emerged as an integral part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, providing a stable medium of exchange, the lack of direct trading pairs between Bitcoin and stablecoins on most platforms poses a significant challenge.
The absence of an interoperable platform with sufficient liquidity to support direct conversions between Bitcoin and stablecoins on any network remained a limitation for a long time until came ChaiDEX.
ChaiDEX boasts a much faster transaction time and lower fees compared to traditional exchanges. It also supports EVM chains, Solana and Bitcoin allowing users to swap assets between chains such as SOL-BTC or ETH-SOL. The DEX has innovated with local stablecoins available in five regions: India, Vietnam, Oman, Nigeria, and the Philippines. These stablecoins, such as the INRC in India, are pegged 1:1 to their respective fiat currencies and backed by USD-pegged stablecoins like USDT/USDC.
ChaiDEX sets itself apart by offering interoperability across multiple blockchain networks, making it simple to purchase Bitcoin with any stablecoin on any network.
In addition to these local stablecoins, ChaiDEX also offers CHAIT, which serves as the utility token of the platform. CHAIT is used primarily for governance and accessing specific features on the ChaiDEX platform rather than just financial stability goals done by other stablecoins.
These stablecoins serve as a reliable and efficient medium of exchange, enabling users to acquire Bitcoin without the volatility typically associated with other cryptocurrencies.
To purchase Bitcoin using a stablecoin users typically needed to follow a multi-step process involving centralized exchanges, wallet transfers and DEX trading. This process can be cumbersome and may incur additional fees and transaction times compared to direct trading pairs. Let’s get a better understanding of some of the other challenges faced by users while purchasing a Bitcoin on a DEX.
Challenges Faced by Users while Purchasing Bitcoin via Stablecoin on DEXs?
Buying Bitcoin directly from any stablecoin on any network involves a few complexities and limitations some of which are:- 
Network Compatibility
Bitcoin operates on its own blockchain which is different from where most stablecoins are issued and the lack of local stablecoins in each country adds to the problems of compatability. For instance, popular stablecoins like USDT and USDC are predominantly issued on Ethereum, Tron, and other blockchains. To exchange these stablecoins directly for Bitcoin, there needs to be a bridge or mechanism that facilitates the cross-chain transaction, which adds complexity. 
Liquidity and Exchange Support
Not all exchanges support direct trading pairs between Bitcoin and every stablecoin across all networks. This limitation is often due to liquidity issues—exchanges tend to support trading pairs that have enough user demand and trading volume to ensure smooth market operations.
Regulatory and Security Concerns
Cross-chain operations, especially those involving different assets like Bitcoin and various stablecoins pose regulatory and security challenges. 
Technological Infrastructure
The technology required to facilitate seamless and secure cross-chain transactions is still evolving. Solutions like wrapped tokens (e.g.Wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum) and decentralized bridges are in development, but they come with their own risks and limitations.
Up until now to buy Bitcoin using a stablecoin from a specific network one typically has to rely on centralized or decentralized exchanges that support such transactions or use intermediary currencies or services to facilitate the exchange.

DroomDroom’s article about peer-to-peer trading platforms and how they offer an alternative to centralized exchanges for crypto trading. Read here.

ChaiDEX: Purchase Bitcoin via Any Stablecoin on Any Network 
Purchasing Bitcoin on ChaiDEX offers several advantages, including its non-custodial nature which ensures you retain control over your funds. The platform supports direct token trading without needing wrapped tokens, or token bridging solutions. Apart from these basic benefits of a hybrid DEX some reasons that make ChaiDEX your primary contender for in the DeFi world are:- 
Lower Transaction Fees 
When compared to the inefficiencies of traditional DEX aggregators, ChaiDEX addresses the issue of high trading costs which arises from complex routing paths to buy BTC (for example.) Manually checking multiple DEXs for the best prices can be tedious and inefficient, leading to higher overall costs for traders. 
ChaiDEX charges a low transaction fee of 0.1% and distributes 50% of the returns to stakers. Moreover, ChaiDEX has the remaining 50% allocated to a buyback and burn program creating token stability.

In case you were stuck, here’s your guide to staking on ChaiDEX for how this decentralized exchange uses a buyback and burn mechanism to stabilize its token price.

Interoperability
ChaiDEX stands out not just for its broad support across multiple blockchain networks but also for enabling the first-ever cross-chain transfers without the need for bridging solutions. This capability allows for seamless and direct transactions between different blockchains.
ChaiDEX utilizes a staking mechanism that involves depositing stablecoins into a secure pool to accumulate rewards and mint local stablecoins. 
Presently, ChaiDEX supports transactions across 11 different chains and will be supporting many more, enabling exchanges between a variety of cryptocurrencies (for example BTC – SOL) 

DeFi’s true potential lies in democratizing finance and creating a borderless financial ecosystem. 
Our vision is to shape a future where blockchain isn’t just a platform for innovation, but a cornerstone for ethical and equitable practices across industries.
Jaydip Rathod, Founder, ChaiDEX 


For an in-depth review of the hybrid DEX, ChaiDEX, including its unique features and advantages, read this DroomDroom article.

Faster Transactions 
ChaiDEX utilizes Atomic Swap technology to power its transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries or “hoppers” that can cause delays. 
Atomic Swaps enables ChaiDEX to facilitate transactions across different blockchain networks. This means that users can trade assets native to one blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain) for assets native to another blockchain (e.g., Ethereum on the Ethereum blockchain) without the need for token bridges or wrapping. 
Localised Stablecoins 
ChaiDEX has hit it for a homerun with its local stablecoins pegged 1:1 against their local currencies, currently available in five regions, India, Vietnam, Oman, Nigeria and the Philipines. These local stablecoins are backed by USDC and USDT and not the local currencies because of regulatory issues. These local stablecoins provide users with the freedom to buy or sell them quickly and with minimal fees, as they are not subject to pricing or liquidity constraints.
Overall, these local stablecoins are designed to be a stable and reliable way to store and transfer value. They are free from pricing or liquidity constraints and they are always backed by real value.ChaiDEX V0.2 supports EVM chains, Solana, and Bitcoin, allowing users to easily swap assets between chains such as SOL-BTC or ETH-SOL.
In order to make sure that these stablecoins are reliable, ChaiDEX maintains a reserve of USD-pegged stablecoins which are equal or greater to the number of stablecoins in circulation. Doing this the and allowing everyone to verify that they have the reserves, the DEX ensures a transparent proof-of-reserves process.
Conclusion – How to Purchase Bitcoin on DEX
Buying Bitcoin with a stablecoin on a DEX was a challenge. Network incompatibility between Bitcoin and most stablecoins forced users through complex cross-chain transactions or exchanges with limited pairs. This resulted in slow speeds, high fees and security concerns.
ChaiDEX reduces this complexity. It acts as a network-agnostic DEX, allowing Bitcoin purchases with any stablecoin on any network. Through atomic swaps and a strong staking mechanism, ChaiDEX offers faster transactions, lower fees and increased security. This innovative approach positions ChaiDEX as the only DEX where users can purchase a Bitcoin on any network via any stablecoin.

Short squeeze alert: This cryptocurrency could skyrocket next week


Ethena (ENA) has been heavily shorted in the derivatives market, showing staggering negative funding rates on May 18. The cryptocurrency could suffer a short squeeze soon as the market’s open interest weighs toward short positions against ENA.
Notably, the most relevant indicator for a short squeeze alert on Ethena is its massive negative funding rate. On that note, Finbold retrieved data from CoinGlass showing ENA short-sellers are paying a 268% APR to long-position traders.
Funding Rate Heatmap: ENA. Source: CoinGlass / Finbold
Moreover, Ethena has the 25th largest open interest (OI) among all cryptocurrencies, currently with $194.21 million in open positions. ENA’s OI stands out with 16% of a $1.19 billion market cap, one of the largest OI/MCap ratios.


ENA derivatives market data. Source: CoinGlass / Finbold
Ethena (ENA) short squeeze price target
As of this writing, ENA trades at $0.78, up 10.26% in the last 24 hours. The 24-hour open interest increased by 12.5%, while the volume increased by 35.48% to $541.55 million traded. Interestingly, $283.67 million were made of opened short positions in this period, with a 50.54% dominance.
In the case of a short squeeze, the token could target two key price zones. First, a short-squeeze liquidity pool awaits from $0.83 to $0.89, with most liquidations at $0.84. The second key level lies at $1.08.
A run to these price targets could render Ethena investors 7.7% to 38% gains from its current exchange rate.
ENA Liquidation Heatmap, 1 month. Source: CoinGlass / Finbold
However, Ethena’s long-term fundamentals are yet to be unveiled as the project has raised meaningful concerns in the crypto community.
What is Ethena (ENA)?
In summary, Ethena is a protocol built on Ethereum (ETH) that has a governance token, ENA. The protocol aims to be “the internet bond,” providing a synthetic dollar, USDe, and “internet native yield,” as described in its official communications.
Its popularity skyrocketed when Arthur Hayes personally supported the project, followed by massive support from key players. Some skeptics have compared it to Terra’s (LUNA) surge and value proposition, which later culminated in its crash in 2022.
Therefore, the current short-selling interest could be a bearish demonstration of Ethena’s fundamentals instead of short-term speculation. This could prevent a short squeeze from happening despite all the signals and technical indicators.
Nevertheless, it is impossible to know whether Ethena will be a huge success or a drastic failure. Investors engaging with ENA and USDe must understand the risks and make conscious decisions moving forward.

Bitcoin Price Hits Critical Resistance Level at $67,500: Analysis


The Bitcoin (BTC) price has reached the critical golden ratio resistance at around $67,500. BTC has been up roughly 10% in the last four days.
However, Bitcoin is now encountering significant resistance. Will this lead to a bearish rejection for BTC?
Will Bitcoin’s Current Price Return to the Upward Trend?
Bitcoin’s price has risen over 10% in the last four days, forming a bullish price pattern. This is due to Bitcoin creating an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, from which the BTC price has already broken out bullishly.

The golden ratio near $67,500 coincides with BTC’s crucial Fibonacci resistance. A bullish break at this level would signal a return to an uptrend for Bitcoin. Consequently, the corrective movement would be invalidated, and Bitcoin could target or even exceed its previous all-time high of around $73,800.
The Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) have a golden crossover, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines are also bullishly crossed. The MACD histogram is ticking bullishly higher, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neutral. Overall, the indicators in the daily chart are bullish.

However, the 4-hour (4H) chart indicators are signaling bearish tendencies. The BTC price could face short-term bearish pressure and be rejected at the golden ratio resistance near $67,500.
This is because the RSI is showing a bearish divergence, and the MACD lines are about to make a bearish crossover. Additionally, the MACD histogram is already ticking lower in a bearish manner.
Only the EMAs are giving bullish signals due to the golden crossover. This suggests that the trend remains bullish in the short term.

It is important to note that Bitcoin’s price could initiate a correction to reach the 0.382 Fibonacci (Fib) level at around $63,280. That scenario marks a downside potential of around 5.4%. Beyond that, significant support awaits the BTC price at around $60,500.

Bitcoin Dominance Continues Rising in Parallel Upward Channel
Furthermore, the weekly chart suggests potential signs of the end of the corrective movement. Bitcoin stayed above the golden ratio support at around $60,500 and has risen over 11% this week.
The MACD histogram has started to tick higher this week after trending lower for six consecutive weeks. However, the MACD lines remain in a bearish crossover, and the RSI is moving into neutral territory.

Meanwhile, in the monthly chart, the MACD histogram is ticking higher again this month after ticking lower last month. The MACD lines remain in a bullish crossover, and the RSI is nearing overbought regions.

Bitcoin dominance continues to move upwards within the parallel upward channel. The next significant Fib resistance is at around 60.5%.
On the downside, Bitcoin’s dominance finds significant support at the 50-month EMA, around 52.65%. Additional significant Fib supports are at approximately 50% and 45%.

The MACD lines are bullishly crossed, and the RSI is in neutral territory. However, the MACD histogram has been ticking lower for several months.

Nonetheless, Bitcoin’s dominance (BTCD) is in a clear upward trend. If the BTC price breaks out bullishly, this could further spur Bitcoin dominance.

Mysterious 7,000 ETH Move to Robinhood as Ethereum Tops $3,000

In a move that has intrigued the cryptocurrency community, a staggering 7,000 Ethereum (ETH) has been transferred to Robinhood, the popular stock brokerage app, just as Ethereum's value soared past the $3,000 mark.Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has steadily risen since recovering from a low of $2,862 on May 15. The rise continued, with Ethereum's price surpassing the psychological barrier of $3,000.At the time of writing, ETH was up 3.14% in the last 24 hours to $3,131, having previously reached intraday highs of $3,148.Crypto data tracker Whale Alert reports that 7,000 ETH worth $21,630,557 was transferred from an unknown wallet to Robinhood. This substantial transfer has led to speculations about the motivations and potential impact on the market. The transfer could be a precursor to a larger market play, with investors positioning themselves as the Ethereum ETF decision approaches.Another theory is that a whale or large holder might be leveraging Robinhood’s platform for trading or custodial purposes, given that one of the reasons tokens are moved to exchanges is to sell them. A plausible explanation could be that the transfer is meant to bolster liquidity on Robinhood’s platform. Despite all of this, the exact reason for the move remains unknown.Ethereum ETF decision loomsFollowing months of silence, the U.S. SEC is expected to decide on at least one application for an ETF that invests directly in Ethereum by next week. After delayed judgments on fund applications for several months, the SEC has a May 23 deadline to approve or deny VanEck's application.According to Bloomberg, who cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter, some fund companies fear a rejection because their private conversations with the SEC have not been as robust as they were before the approval of spot-Bitcoin ETFs in January.A denial may eventually lead to a lawsuit. Grayscale Investments' August court victory in its fight against the SEC set the stage for the January approval of spot Bitcoin funds.

Mollars Crypto Half as Popular as Pepe Token According To Google Trends


                        
                            Mollars Crypto Half as Popular as Pepe Token  According To Google Trends                        
                        

                         The ICO for 2024’s new store of value [SOV] altcoin, Mollars (MOLLARS), is pushing quickly towards US$1,500,000.  Today the project’s initial coin offering moved  to 72%, leaving less than 28% of the tokens allocated for the presale available for purchase.What Is Mollars?
The new altcoin is highly popular because it’s the answer to Bitcoin for Ethereum Blockchain’s 250-million wallet holders.  A digital store-of-value asset, deflationary in nature, Mollars has an advantage on $BTC because of its blockchain.   Ethereum-blockchain is faster, cheaper to use, and more scalable.Virtually it lacks all the deficiencies of Bitcoin and even eliminates the risk of the ‘stashed wallets’ owned by BTC founder, Satoshi Nakamoto.    Mollars is possibly the only cryptocurrencies with ‘true decentralization’ of its class in terms of branding value & utility.   The founders nor developers will be given free tokens of its 10-million total token supply.That simple policy of the cryptocurrency eliminates token dumps or market manipulation.Mollars & Dogecoin have this in commonUnknown to some, Dogecoin is possibly the only cryptocurrency in the top 10 that’s ‘truly decentralized’ as its owners took no free tokens either.  Thought of as a joke by the founders, but done with no intent to indulge in self-greed, thanks to Elon Musk & various Fortune 500 companies, the $DOGE has become a globally recognized crypto.Mollars could be on a similar trajectory.Even though it’s not yet listed on exchanges, Mollars search volume is skyrocketing as it nears its June 1st close date.    Google trends reports a major breakout for the keyword terms Mollars, Mollars ICO, Mollars.com, and Mollars crypto.Crypto Traders Search for “Mollars” Half as Much As Pepe TokenApart from breakout keyword terms, “Mollars” has also skyrocketed in terms of search volume.   Some days the brand name’s search volume reaches just under half (50%) that of “Pepe token,” which is the 27th most traded cryptocurrency today.Search volume is generally received as ‘branding value’ in business today, hinting that Mollars may be on the cusp of a major break out in the crypto space.Three cryptocurrency exchanges have already announced they will list the new store of value altcoin.   Bitmart, LBank, and XT will each allow its millions of users access to the token upon the presale’s end on June 1st.Token Stats
With only 10-million tokens being minted ever of the new cryptocurrency, Mollars is expected to sell out and see a hyper-parabolic uptrend in price if it moves past 5-million tokens sold.To date, nearly 3-million $MOLLARS have been sold to crypto traders via the token presale [Mollars.com].  It’s currently being sold for $0.55 cents per token via the ICO event.Mollars will launch on crypto exchanges at a price of $0.62 cents next month, June 1st, if hard cap is reached.  That is a +12% increase  of today’s price.If popularity continues to swell, prices could become substantially greater according to reports from various cryptocurrency news outlets and its respected analysts.YouTube channel analyst, Ari of Crypto News suggested the price could see a 20x increase (+2000%)  in value based on tokenomics and project infrastructure.CryptoNews on-site analyst Klimnet Dukovski suggests a potential high of $6.Both projections were made over 4 months ago when Mollars ICO had raised less than $150,000 (USD) raised and under 350,000 tokens were sold.Today, the project is nearing $1.4-million-dollars in funds raised and almost 3-million tokens sold.

Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Witnesses Bullish Shift - BTC Price To $70,000 Soon? | Bitcoinist.com


								After hitting an all-time high of $73,737 in mid-March, the price of Bitcoin has not been able to sustain itself at a high level of vigor and strength. The premier cryptocurrency did, in fact, enter a new era with the April halving event, but its price performance in the past weeks has yet to reflect this.
However, Bitcoin enjoyed a stroke of fortune in the past week, with its price climbing above $67,000 for the first time in nearly a month. Although the sentiment around the crypto market and its leader has not been particularly encouraging in the last few weeks, the recent bullish rally seems to be driving a shift in that regard.
Can Bullish Sentiment Push BTC Price To $70,000?
According to a recent report by on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the sentiment of the crypto crowd has shifted toward Bitcoin following its latest rally above $67,000. This revelation is based on the Weighted Sentiment metric, which measures the overall positive or negative sentiment towards a cryptocurrency.

This indicator is based on two sub-metrics; namely sentiment score and social volume. The sentiment score metric checks whether the crowd is negative or positive about the asset, while social volume tracks the total amount of discussion around an asset on social media.
Weighted sentiment is a product of both sentiment score and social volume. And there is a significant change in the metric when the social volume is high and there is a distinct average sentiment (either positive or negative).

Source: Santiment/X
According to Santiment, Bitcoin’s weighted sentiment recently hit its most bullish level since January, triggered by the latest price surge. The last time sentiment around the premier cryptocurrency was this bullish was after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved BTC spot ETFs in the United States.
Interestingly, Bitcoin is not the only top 20 cryptocurrency enjoying a positive sentiment at the moment. Sentiment’s data shows that the Chainlink (LINK) token, which has seen its value swell by nearly 20% in the past week, is witnessing its most bullish sentiment in over a year.
While a bullish sentiment is not necessarily a bad sign, FOMO (fear of missing out) can easily set in as a result, often leading to a price crash. Santiment did note in its posts that “FOMO staying low” is necessary for a sustained Bitcoin price rally and a potential move to $70,000.
Bitcoin Price At A Glance
As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $66,924, reflecting a 2.3% increase in the past day. More notably, the premier cryptocurrency is up by 10% on the weekly timeframe.

Billionaire Mike Novogratz Issues Warning, Says Bitcoin Is Unlikely To Hit a New High Without Macro Assistance - The Daily Hodl


								Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz is warning that Bitcoin (BTC) is not likely to print fresh all-time highs (ATH) until macro conditions change.
In a new interview on Galaxy’s podcast, the billionaire says that Bitcoin will probably trade sideways until Fed rate cuts, which he believes would be bullish for the crypto king.










More favorable crypto regulations could also push Bitcoin to new ATHs, he says.
“There’s a resurgence of the ‘Oh my God, the economy’s slowing down’ narrative, which will be helpful. I don’t think Bitcoin will take out the old high, the $73,000 high, unless we get the Fed in action, or we get some big regulatory breakthrough. Those are both probably low delta. 
I think we’re in a bit of a range – $55,000 to $75,000. That’s a pretty big range. It’s probably closer to $57,000 to $73,000. We’ve probably put the low and the high in. I do believe the next move is up because I do think we’re going to get closer to the election and [Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome] Powell is going to want to cut rates.” 
Novogratz says another bullish factor for Bitcoin is the amount of US federal government spending and mounting debt, which he believes will lead more people to invest in BTC as “digital gold.”
“Right now, I talk about two things: crypto regulation and the debt. And they’re at odds with each other. If we had an administration, Biden or Trump, that addressed this 26% of GDP federal budget, which should be 20%, it would not be good for Bitcoin. 
And so having really crappy policymakers and profligate spenders and populists in Washington, great for my net worth. That’s just the story of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is going up for the same reason gold is going up. It’s gone up faster because we’re a newer technology, we are a newer commodity, and therefore the adoption cycle is happening faster.”
Bitcoin is trading for $66,849 at time of writing, up 2.5% in the last 24 hours.

Over 50 Million USDT Blacklisted by Tether, What Happened?


Tether, the company behind world’s best-known stablecoin, has blacklisted five unknown wallets that received a total of 54.1 million USDT, according to data provided by Arkham Intelligence.The most recent transfer, observed two days ago, originated from a wallet that had previously dispersed most of its funds to other wallets in the preceding six months.Source: ArkhamThis is not the first instance of Tether cracking down on addresses linked to illicit activities. Tether previously froze about 225 million USDT tokens in collaboration with OKX and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) during an investigation into an international human trafficking syndicate tied to a romance scam in Southeast Asia.Amid increased regulatory scrutiny, Tether has been actively screening its customers for compliance and blacklisting wallets connected to suspicious behavior.In another development, Bloomberg reported that Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange, is considering removing Tether (USDT) from its platform to comply with the forthcoming regulatory framework outlined in the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), set to take effect in July this year.Kraken is currently evaluating potential actions, including ceasing support for Tether, the most heavily traded cryptocurrency on its platform within the European Union. The upcoming regulations outlined in MiCA are expected to impact Tether Holdings Ltd.'s USDT, a stablecoin designed to maintain a one-to-one value with the dollar.The impending guidance, pending finalization by the European Banking Authority, is poised to impose restrictions on stablecoins offered to investors within the bloc. Stablecoins are predominantly used by traders for facilitating the transfer of digital assets between exchanges and as a means of safeguarding wealth against token price fluctuations.

Big Business Wants Bitcoin | Bankless


1️⃣ Bitcoin ETF HoldersBitcoin saw a ~10% rally this week, breaking through $67K on Friday due to positive CPI readings and notable ETF holdings disclosures.Millennium Management, one of the world’s largest hedge funds, disclosed $2B in Bitcoin ETF holdings from BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.Bracebridge Capital, a hedge fund managing Yale and Princeton's endowments, announced $262M in ARK 21Shares ETF and $81M in BlackRock’s IBIT.Point72, the Knicks Owner Steven Cohen’s $34B hedge fund, held $77.5M in the Fidelity BTC ETF (FBTC) as of Q1.The Wisconsin Investment Board reported $162M in Bitcoin ETF holdings.Research from River, a Bitcoin brokerage firm, shows 13 of the top 25 U.S. hedge funds bought BTC ETFs in Q1. While these holdings might be a long-term bet on Bitcoin, they could also be for market making, hedging, or short-term flipping.2️⃣ Tornado Cash Dev SentencedPrivacy was deemed a crime this week when Alexey Pertsev, a Tornado Cash developer, was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to 64 months by a Dutch court. The sentence alleges Pertsev laundered billions through Tornado Cash between 2019 and 2022. Pertsev's co-founder, Roman Storm, faces similar charges in the U.S., with his trial set for September.A Sad Day for The Netherlands on BanklessDeveloper Alexey Pertsev was sentenced to prison over privacy software.3️⃣ Senate Votes to Overturn SAB 121The Senate voted 60-38 to repeal the SEC’s SAB 121, which required firms to record customer digital assets as liabilities instead of as the same as traditional holdings — a major point of friction for adoption. The resolution now heads to President Biden, who has threatened a veto. This marks a significant step for crypto legislation, with bipartisan support reflecting growing interest in thoughtfully developing crypto policy. If Biden vetoes, Congress may attempt to override, challenging the SEC’s stance on crypto in the process.4️⃣ Pump.fun ExploitPump.fun, a popular Solana memecoin launcher, paused operations after a flash loan exploit costing 12.3K SOL (~$2M). Former employee staccoverflow claimed responsibility, citing disdain for his former bosses and personal troubles. The exploit involved accessing a private key and using flash loans to manipulate memecoin bonding curves, then withdrawing liquidity meant for Raydium pools. The platform generated $1.9M in revenues over the two days preceding the exploit, which would cover 95% of the losses, and also flipped Solana in revenue. While, yes, pump can compensate users, this incident highlights, as always, the importance of private key security.5️⃣ Roaring Kitty Sparks Meme Coin FrenzyKeith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, known for leading the GME short squeeze in 2020, resurfaced on Twitter this week. Following his post, over 14,500 new tokens on Solana were created on Sunday, setting a record. Gamestop’s stock GME nearly quadrupled as well before dropping. Gill’s return has reignited interest in meme stocks and crypto, generating millions in profit for traders. Yet, some think he is not actually back, as his YouTube and Reddit accounts remain inactive.

Chinese Analysts Announced: After Bitcoin and Ethereum, This Altcoin's Spot ETF May Launch in Hong Kong - Bitcoin Sistemi


OKX's Hong Kong affiliate, OKLINK, has announced that there is potential for more Tier 1 (L1) tokens like Solana to be accepted as ETFs in the future. This development follows the recent approval of a spot ETF for Ethereum operating on Proof of Stake (POS) in Hong Kong.
The first-day issuance scale of the three Hong Kong Bitcoin spot ETFs reached US$248 million on April 30, well exceeding the initial launch scale of the US Bitcoin spot ETF (excluding Grayscale), which was approximately US$125 million on January 10.



However, subsequent market performance was not as optimistic as expected. As of May 15, 2024, the total asset management scale of six Hong Kong virtual asset spot ETFs exceeded HK$2 billion (about US$264 million), while China Asset Management's Bitcoin asset management scale was 816 million, about 40% of the total. He invented the Hong Kong Dollar.
While these figures pale in comparison to the size of the US Bitcoin spot ETFs (about $51.4 billion), considering the size of the ETF market in Hong Kong ($50 billion) and the US ($8.5 trillion), Hong Kong's local financial Its impact on the market is quite significant.

Crypto's Recovery Mode | Bankless


Bullish Reversal. Crypto assets rallied to safely secure a green week as TradFi stock indexes marched upwards to new all-time highs! What happened in markets this week?BTC was retesting $60k last weekend, but has since rallied higher, gaining nearly 8% on Wednesday after U.S. consumer price index (CPI) inflation for the month of April came in line with analyst expectations.Inflation continues to run above the American Federal Reserve's long-term 2% target, but Wednesday’s CPI print marked the first decline in three months. The release of this series coincided with April retail sales and oil stock data, which showed demand in decline, perversely giving investors cause for optimism by increasing the likelihood of rate cuts.While market participants continue to operate on assumptions that future rate cuts are unequivocally bullish, as their decline decreases the risk-free rate and theoretically bolsters the relative attractiveness of risk assets, it is important to note that they are only one factor in the broader economic equation and that their arrival often coincides with peak recessionary conditions.
This week was extremely volatile for many investors, bringing impressive short squeezes to popular 2021 memestonk mania darlings GameStop and AMC (alongside other heavily shorted equities and certain commodities, including silver, orange juice, and cheese).Back this time with hedge fund participation, both GME and AMC had surged 300% by Tuesday, but plummeted back into orbit during the latter half of the week after announcing significant share sale plans, erasing gains for bulls and smashing the enthusiasm among retail participants.Although the prices of many assets – both of those listed above and stock indexes – have experienced erratic swings in recent weeks, implied volatility has been drained from the market, with the VIX index (a measure of the 30-day implied options volatility of the S&P 500) closing Friday at $11.99, just 1.5% above its 52-week low.Record-high stock prices and a sub-12 print on the VIX suggest market participants are completely devoid of fear, but it is worth keeping in mind that VIX has a habit of rebounding sharply off support and has not traded below this level since January 2018…Source: TradingViewOn Crypto Twitter, Ethereum was the topic du jour (of the week) as prominent figures took to the platform to express their opinions on the future trajectory of ETH price ahead of the SEC’s first final decision deadline to approve or deny spot ETH ETFs on May 23.The ETH/BTC ratio has puked throughout the month of May, breaking multi-year lows as traders continue to brace for seemingly inevitable denial next week.Despite the overwhelmingly negative sentiment that has formed due to an absence of meaningful communication between the SEC and proposed issuers, the SEC’s decision to approve commodity futures-based ETH ETF products for trading last October appears to have provided clarity on ETH’s status as a non-security and suggests that spot instruments will receive approval.Should the SEC deny spot ETH ETFs, it is likely that the agency will provide a justification for why Ether is a crypto asset security, a clarification which could wreak havoc on broader alt markets, however, given that consensus is heavily anticipating denial, an unexpected approval would come as a shock to markets and would likely cause ETH price to explode.

                        Out of the top 25 hedge funds in the United States, 13 have entered the market by investing in the ETFs during the first quarter.Point72, the renowned hedge fund with $34 billion in assets under management, has revealed its investment in the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC).According to a recent filing, Point72 held $77.5 million worth of FBTC at the end of the first quarter.The move follows a growing trend among various hedge funds that have disclosed their purchase of shares in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.Prominent hedge funds, including Elliott Capital led by Paul Singer and Millennium Management owned by Izzy Englander, have publicly shared their investments in these new funds.Millennium Management is Largest Holder of Spot Bitcoin ETFs
Notably, Millennium Management stands as the largest institutional holder of these funds, with approximately $2 billion invested as of March 31.Other notable names among the investors include Fortress Investment Group and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors.While these hedge funds’ purchases of spot ETFs may be seen as a long-term bet on the potential price appreciation of Bitcoin, it’s important to note that these vehicles can serve other purposes as well.Hedge funds may utilize them for market making, hedging strategies, generating yield, or even for short-term flipping, among other reasons.The increasing involvement of top hedge funds in spot Bitcoin ETFs speaks to the growing acceptance and interest in cryptocurrencies within traditional finance.Bitcoin to Return to $74K Highs
Leading trading firm QCP Capital has expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s price momentum, forecasting a potential return to the highs of $74,000.In a recent note, the firm said it has observed substantial buyers acquiring 100,000 to 120,000 BTC Calls for December 2024, indicating confidence in the upward movement of the cryptocurrency.“US CPI numbers triggered a break out of the range across risk assets. BTC has since traded back above 66k,” the firm wrote.Likewise, technical analyst Rekt Capital believes that Bitcoin has emerged from the post-halving “danger zone” and entered an accumulation phase, as indicated by weakening selling pressure.“The Post-Halving Bitcoin “Danger Zone” (purple) is officially over,” the popular crypto trader wrote in a recent post on X.Despite the bullish view from some analysts, Michael Novogratz, the founder of Galaxy Digital Holdings, a prominent digital-asset financial services firm, expects Bitcoin to remain in a relatively narrow trading range in the current quarter.As reported, he expects Bitcoin to remain within the range of approximately $55,000 to $75,000 until specific market events or circumstances push the prices higher.Novogratz mentioned the tailwinds experienced in the fourth quarter of the previous year and the first quarter of this year.“I think that is probably where we are certainly for this quarter, maybe next quarter until either A, the Fed starts cutting rates because the economy finally slows or B, we get through the election and I think the election will bring clarity one way or the other to the crypto regulatory landscape.”

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsWhat a week it's been. The Sunday night return of Roaring Kitty led to a trading frenzy, with meme stocks and digital coins and tokens alike surging.The internet star and financial analyst posted on Twitter (aka X) for the first time in nearly three years. By Monday morning, the price of GameStop had gone through the roof as traders decided to snap up the original meme stock.Roaring Kitty—real name Keith Gill, aka DeepFuckingValue on Reddit—started the meme stock trading craze back in 2021, inspiring amateur traders to buy up dying company shares.His Sunday post caused traders to want to get in on the action again. GameStop stock has since taken a plunge as the short-lived frenzy faded, but at one point this week was up over 200%, NYSE data shows.Roaring Kitty's comeback also led to a surge in meme coin trading. As is usually the case, the world of crypto provided even bigger gains for traders than the stock market.Solana-based tribute token GME went through the roof, hitting new highs before dipping sharply again. It's still up a huge amount, and is now trading for $0.0046—a seven-day rise of 707%. Solana itself is the biggest gainer in the top 10 coins by market cap, meanwhile, up 19% on the week to $172 as of this writing.Major cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin also rose on the return of the craze. The 10th biggest digital asset has put up solid gains this week, up 6% currently at a price of $0.152. But smaller cap memes are some of the biggest gainers. Floki and Pepe have jumped 17% and 10% this past week, respectively.And who can forget Bitcoin? The asset had been on a slow climb until, on Wednesday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics dropped data showing that inflation wasn't as high as expected in April.That increases the chance of a rate cut from the Fed this year—and is bullish for the biggest digital asset. The price of Bitcoin is now at $66,830, up 10% in seven days, according to CoinGecko—the highest since the halving event in April.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Cryptocurrency Revolution in Asia: Companies Announce Plans - Bitcoin Sistemi

A recent survey by SBI Digital Assets Holdings, a subsidiary of Japanese asset manager SBI Holdings, reveals that institutional demand for cryptocurrencies is increasing. The survey found that nearly 60% of Asian institutional investors had exposure to some form of digital asset in the past year.
Almost 40% of these institutions said they wanted to increase their exposure in 2024, while 25% said they planned “significant increases.” Only 15% said they had no plans to invest or trade in digital assets.


“This trend shows that digital assets are increasingly accepted in diversifying investment portfolios,” the report said.
His interests varied. 67% of institutions currently delving into digital assets said they were most interested in cryptocurrencies. However, 33% predicted central bank digital currencies would be most widely adopted in the next three years.






Tokenizing real-world assets is also a priority, with almost 62% of institutions reporting that their customers have requested tokenized securities.
When asked what types of assets they would prioritize in tokenization, 40% of institutions said real estate, 14% said funds, 14% said physical infrastructure, 10% said bonds, and 10% said collectibles such as works of art. The rest was split between stocks and precious metals.


“When it comes to the benefits of tokenizing real-world assets, nearly half of respondents cite the reduction of intermediaries as the primary factor, while faster settlements, cost efficiency, improved transparency and increased liquidity are also listed as other factors,” the report said.
However, participants also saw barriers to adoption. 60% of respondents said the biggest hurdle is “the lack of a reliable ecosystem to process transactions end-to-end.” In other words, institutions are concerned that the current crypto infrastructure does not allow them to run their business properly.





Only 20% of organizations stated that cyber threats pose a greater danger, while 18% cited a lack of regulatory clarity for the sector.

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $50 billion market cap in the first half of 2024


The cryptocurrency market is showing signs of recovery, with the total market capitalization rising by approximately 2.50% in the last 24 hours to reach $2.55 trillion on May 18. 
This ongoing bullish sentiment particularly benefits several cryptocurrencies on the verge of significant market cap milestones, notably the $50 billion mark.
Finbold has identified two altcoins—XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE)—that could potentially reach a market cap of $50 billion by the first half of 2024. These digital assets have favorable conditions that could drive their market capitalization higher.


XRP
XRP’s price performance has been challenging for many investors, staying mostly below $1 and struggling to hold support above $0.50. Despite this, optimism is growing about XRP’s future. The ongoing legal disputes between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could be resolved positively for Ripple, providing a significant boost for XRP.
Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin launch is anticipated to attract more users to its platform, benefiting XRP. This new development could drive further adoption and enhance Ripple’s ecosystem.
XRP market capitalization. Source: CoinMarketCap
Notably, XRP whales have been accumulating the token significantly. Data from Santiment, highlighted by on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, shows that whale addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP stacked $55 million in the past two weeks. This accumulation trend suggests that large investors are confident in XRP’s potential.
Additionally, XRP’s price has been rising due to a broader market recovery and cooling inflation in the U.S. 
As the market approaches the first half of 2024, these factors could potentially set the stage for a rally, possibly leading to a $50 billion market capitalization. Currently, XRP is trading at $0.50 with a market cap of $27.64 billion.
Dogecoin (DOGE)
By mid-2024, the meme coin DOGE  seems poised to reach the $1 milestone and potentially achieve a $50 billion market cap. The large-cap meme coin has a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of about $28 billion and approximately 7 million on-chain holders.
Renowned crypto analyst World Of Charts suggests that Dogecoin is approaching a critical descending trendline, with a potential breakout that could trigger a 100% surge in its price, aiming for a target of approximately $0.29.
DOGE market capitalization. Source: CoinMarketCap
Dogecoin benefits from strong backing by Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who has been an outspoken supporter of the coin. Additionally, products like the upcoming X Payments could further enhance Dogecoin’s utility in payments.
Currently, DOGE is trading at $0.1525 with a market cap of $28 billion, needing a significant boost to reach the $50 billion milestone by May 2024.
These two cryptocurrencies are likely to attract increased investment if the cryptocurrency market continues its bullish momentum, pushing their market caps over the $50 billion threshold.
As the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile it is crucial for cryptocurrency investors to conduct thorough research and prioritize robust projects to ensure sound capital allocation.

Bitcoin Advocate Is Super Bullish on Shiba Inu ($SHIB) | Cryptoglobe


                                
Jason Williams is a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency space, particularly recognized for his investments and outspoken presence on social media. He is a co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, an investment firm that focuses on blockchain technology and digital assets. Williams has a background in traditional finance and has transitioned into the crypto industry, advocating for the adoption of digital currencies and blockchain technology.



Recently, Williams made an outrageous price prediction for SHIB, the main native token of Shiba Inu.



Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a decentralized cryptocurrency introduced in August 2020 by an anonymous creator or group of creators known as Ryoshi. An Ethereum-based altcoin, it features the Shiba Inu dog breed as its mascot. Often categorized as a “meme coin” or parody cryptocurrency, SHIB aims to rival or surpass Dogecoin, positioning itself as a “Dogecoin killer.”



The Shiba Inu ecosystem emphasizes a community-driven approach, outlined in its “woof paper.” The project was built from scratch, without a pre-existing community or team, showcasing the power of collective decentralization to create a unique and impactful venture. The ecosystem includes tokens such as $SHIB, $LEASH, and $BONE, as well as SHIBOSHIs and SHEboshi NFTs.



ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX), is central to the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It allows users to trade, farm, and stake SHIB and other ecosystem tokens like BONE and LEASH. Operating on the Ethereum network and utilizing its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, ShibaSwap offers a secure and efficient platform for transactions.



Currently (as of 3:13 p.m. UTC on May 18), SHIB is trading at around $0.00002448, down 2% in the past 24-hour period. Its $14.48 billion market cap makes it the $12 most valuable cryptoasset.







In the year-to-date period, SHIB is up 135.25%. However, Williams believes SHIB’s rally is going to take its price to stratospheric levels in this cycle.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

To reach $0.05, SHIB’s price will have to climb another 204,000%, which is quite a tall order and seems extremely optimistic, to say the least. However, it would be wrong to think that Williams is super bullish on cryptocurrencies; e.g., his price target for $XRP and $ADA is $0.5 in this cycle.



The day after Williams shared his price targets for various cryptocurrencies, the Shiba Inu team announced a significant update to its decentralized finance (DeFi) offerings, with ShibaSwap now being ported to the Shibarium blockchain. This upgrade allows ShibaSwap to function on both the Ethereum and Shibarium networks, enhancing the ecosystem’s ability to support creators, foster connections, and drive innovation.



The transition to Shibarium brings several new utilities to ShibaSwap, improving its functionality as a decentralized exchange (DEX) and decentralized application (DApp) platform. Key enhancements include an upgraded dashboard, simplified processes for adding and withdrawing liquidity, streamlined staking, and improved trend analysis tools. The platform also now features discovery charts for new and trending tokens, aiding traders in navigating market volatility. Additionally, the onboarding process for new tokens on ShibaSwap has been made more user-friendly.



The Shiba Inu community is encouraged to use ShibaSwap on the Shibarium blockchain. A portion of transaction fees will be allocated to increasing the value of liquidity provider (LP) tokens used in swap transactions, which is expected to benefit yield farmers within the community.



Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, highlighted that the updated ShibaSwap provides a transformative experience for DeFi innovators on Shibarium. The redesigned platform supports community tokens and facilitates easy porting of existing Shibarium tokens. Kusama noted that this is an early version of ShibaSwap, with further updates planned.



Shibarium is designed to enable high-speed transactions with minimal gas fees, enhancing the user experience in the blockchain space. It is built on a community-first and environmentally friendly consensus mechanism, allowing for the development of cost-effective protocols. This expansion enriches the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which includes the $SHIB and $LEASH tokens, SHEboshis DN-404 tokens, SHIB The Metaverse, the ShibaSwap DEX, and the Shiba Eternity game.

As Shiba Inu progresses in its journey, the dog-themed cryptocurrency faces a financial frontier: reaching a break-even price of $0.00005.This target is not just a number — it represents the collective hope and determination of the Shiba Inu community to see their beloved token rise to new highs. To achieve this break-even point, a staggering 106 trillion SHIB tokens need to align with the price goal of $0.00005.The Break Even Price indicator from IntoTheBlock provides an aggregate of holders' realized gains and losses for a particular crypto asset. For addresses that have realized losses, the price would have to increase to the specified price range for these holders to break even on their positions.Shiba Inu (SHIB) Break Even Price, Courtesy: IntoTheBlockAccording to this indicator, 308,180 addresses hold 106.54 trillion SHIB at a loss between $0.000026 and $0.000051, with an average price of $0.000034.This suggests that over 308,000 Shiba Inu addresses would require SHIB to rise to $0.000051 to break even. Given the current market dynamics, this is no easy task, requiring a confluence of market forces and investor sentiment.SHIB to $0.00005?As of now, SHIB’s price hovers around $0.000025, with a market capitalization of $14.59 billion, ranking it 11th among top cryptocurrencies by market value. The move to $0.00005 would represent a substantial increase of over 100%, which raises questions about what might drive such a surge.In the very short term, Shiba Inu faces a stiff barrier at the daily SMA 50 near $0.000025. A break above this crucial level may be required for SHIB to exit its current trading range and revisit highs at $0.000030 and $0.000032.If a breakout above this key barrier fails, Shiba Inu might persist in its current range with support near $0.000018 and $0.00002 for some time.As eyes are peeled on where Shiba Inu price trends next, the Shiba Inu development team continues to build. ShibaSwap launched on Shibarium this week, allowing users to create new liquidity pools and perform cross-swaps between Ethereum and Shibarium.

XRP Lawsuit Close to Climax? Here's What We Know - DailyCoin


        

A long-awaited decision in the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple has been anticipated to arrive by summer 2024.



A summer conclusion would still leave questions. Will the SEC’s push to limit Ripple’s core business succeed?



A clear ruling has the potential to impact the entire cryptocurrency market.




The ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC has been a thorn in the side of XRP investors for years. The lawsuit, which alleges XRP is an unregistered security, has clouded the token’s future and contributed to its sluggish price performance. But a recent glimmer of hope has emerged: the lawsuit might be nearing its end.



Potential Summer Resolution?



Experts are predicting a potential end date for the lawsuit at the district court level by July or August 2024. This means a ruling on the core issue, is XRP a security?, could be issued soon. This timeframe provides some much-needed relief for investors who have been anxiously waiting for a resolution.




Adding to the optimism is the possibility of a ruling on fines for Ripple. The SEC’s proposed $2 billion penalty has cast a long shadow over the case. If the judge issues a significantly lower verdict, it could be a strong indicator that the court is siding with Ripple on the security question.



While the potential for a summer conclusion is exciting, some uncertainties remain. The lawsuit’s impact on Ripple’s business model is a key worry. The SEC’s request for an injunction on Ripple’s On-demand Liquidity (ODL) service, if granted, could significantly disrupt the company’s operations.



But Wait, There’s More…



Beyond the immediate outcome, a clear ruling from the judge is crucial for XRP’s long-term viability. The classification of XRP as a security or not will have ripple effects (pun intended) throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem.The potential for a conclusion by summer 2024 could be a turning point for XRP. A final decision from the court could provide the clarity the cryptocurrency market has been desperately waiting for. 



If the judge rules in favor of Ripple, it could pave the way for wider adoption of XRP and a potential price surge. On the other hand, an unfavorable ruling could have significant negative consequences for both Ripple and XRP.



On the Flipside




Even if XRP is deemed not a security, the SEC could still appeal the decision, prolonging the uncertainty.



A ruling in this case might not provide the much-needed clarity for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, as each case has its own unique aspects.



Appeals from either side could significantly extend the lawsuit timeline.




Why This Matters



A summer resolution to the Ripple vs SEC case could provide long-awaited clarity for the entire crypto market, potentially boosting XRP adoption if it’s deemed not a security, while a negative ruling could set a worrying precedent for other cryptocurrencies.




Analysts are divided on whether XRP’s price will surge or consolidate this weekend, with some predicting a surge to $0.65 by mid-week. Read about it here:XRP Analysts Place Bullish Bets for the Weekend: $0.65 Soon?



Analysts are monitoring indicators to predict XRP’s price movement. This article examines if XRP will reach its $0.60 target. See their insights here:Is XRP’s $0.60 Target in Jeopardy? Here Are Key Signs To Watch

Cardano Whales Return To The Table, Increase Massive Holdings By 10%


																Cardano (ADA) whales are back in the picture, with recent data suggesting their confidence in the crypto token may have been revived. If so, this will be massive for ADA, which could experience significant price surges soon enough based on this development. 

	Related Reading



Cardano Whales Add To Their Holdings
The market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock recently revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Cardano whales (who hold between 100 million and 1 billion ADA) have now added 11% to their balances over the past 30 days. These investors now hold 6.71% of Cardano’s total supply. 

This represents a bullish development for Cardano since whale accumulation usually suggests that these investors are positioning for a potential price surge. These whales also contribute to the price surge since buys of such magnitude could trigger a rally in the price of any crypto token. 
Besides the whales, retail investors are also heavily invested in Cardano. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that the bid-ask volume imbalance is bullish for ADA. Furthermore, the ‘In The Money’ metric has also turned bullish for Cardano, meaning that most of these investors are currently in profit. 
Generally, the confidence in the Cardano ecosystem is growing once again. Data from DeFiLlama shows that the Total Value Locked (TVL) on the network has increased by over 5% in the last seven days. Lately, there has also been a significant increase in Cardano’s trading volume, meaning users are actively trading on the network. 
Cardano is currently trading at $0.482. Chart: TradingView
Cardano’s Rally Is Imminent 
Crypto analyst World of Charts suggested that Cardano might soon experience a significant rally, noting that the crypto token’s breakout was already confirmed and moving toward the projected price targets. The analyst had previously predicted that a successful breakout would take Cardano’s price to $1 in the coming weeks. 
Crypto analyst Trend Rider also confirmed that Cardano is already witnessing a bullish reversal, highlighting the bounce the crypto token made after flashing a bullish signal on the daily chart. In the short term, the analyst expects ADA to climb back above $0.5 and added that Cardano will need to hold above $0.51 on the weekly to end the price correction and confirm a bullish continuation. 

	Related Reading



Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, also provided insights into Cardano’s future trajectory. He noted that Cardano is currently breaking its 20-day moving average (MA), which the analyst claimed is a very “nice sign” for ADA. 
Gambardello pointed out on Cardano’s daily chart that the 50-day MA has crossed the 200-day MA, which likely means that the bottom is already in, and this is the lowest Cardano will go. This occurrence is referred to as a golden cross and is a bullish signal, indicating the beginning of an upward trend.

Crypto Exchange Kraken Mulls Pulling Support for Top Stablecoin USDT in the EU: Report - The Daily Hodl


								The San Francisco-based crypto exchange Kraken is reportedly mulling whether to pull support for the stablecoin USDT in the European Union (EU).
Bloomberg reports that Kraken is “actively reviewing” its European support for the Tether-issued stablecoin.










European digital asset trade associations and think tanks have warned that the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) could ban the largest stablecoins by trading volume.
MiCA is the upcoming EU legislation that will provide rules covering the supervision, consumer protection and environmental safeguards of crypto assets. The law also includes measures that aim to reduce financial crimes including market manipulation, money laundering and terrorist financing. It’s scheduled to take effect in December 2024.
USDT is the largest stablecoin by market cap and aims to maintain a 1:1 peg to the US dollar.
Marcus Hughes, Kraken’s global head of regulatory strategy, tells Bloomberg that their stablecoin offerings are “an evolving picture.”
“We’re absolutely planning for all eventualities, including situations where it’s just not tenable to list specific tokens such as USDT. It’s something that we’re actively reviewing, and as the position becomes clearer, we can take firm decisions on that.”
Hughes acknowledges the number of stablecoins that Kraken currently offers in Europe will likely be reduced.

Wells Fargo Hands Fake $100 Bill To Customer, Issues Alert on Worthless Withdrawal and Counterfeit Cash: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A Wells Fargo customer says she’s shocked after the banking giant gave her fake cash during a seemingly routine withdrawal.
Kam Ridley recently went to a Wells Fargo branch in Mississippi to withdraw cash and pay bills, reports the ABC-affiliated news station WAPT.










Ridley then went to her other bank, Trustmark, to deposit the cash – but the ATM refused to accept her $100 bill.
Bewildered, Ridley went inside the bank and spoke to a teller who told her the money from Wells Fargo is obviously fake.
“When I give it to the teller, she says, ‘Oh, I can’t take it. It’s counterfeit.’ 
I was like, ‘Girl, no. No.’ I said, ‘Run the little marker thing over it.’ And she said, ‘I don’t have to. I’m looking at it. It’s counterfeit.'”
In response to the incident, Wells Fargo released a statement on its efforts to scan paper money and fight fraud.
“[Wells Fargo] takes great measures to educate our employees on how to identify and alert authorities to counterfeit currency. 
We are committed to working closely with law enforcement officials to stop counterfeiters.”
Although Wells Fargo acknowledged the fraud, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency says customers who discover their bank gave them fake money may be out of luck and unable to prove what happened.
“Unfortunately, this circumstance would be a factual dispute. You can claim the bank gave you the counterfeit bill; the bank can claim that you, after leaving the premises, obtained the counterfeit bill elsewhere.”
Reports of people trying to use counterfeit cash have spread across the US in recent weeks, including reports of people trying to bleach $1 bills and print $100 marks on top.
Last year, the US Secret Service says it confiscated $21.8 million in fake money, with 197 arrests.

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) Will Skyrocket 14,000% Before KuCoin Listing, As Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GAMBCAT has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gambling Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gambling Cat could become the next viral memecoin.



Gambling Cat launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gambling Cat on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gambling Cat by entering its contract address – B4BQTfBJ6uQYkzaZyQjTmH7k3c9gzXQ3FrPMPDstpYAn – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAMBCAT.

Dogwifhat (WIF) price was down 11% on the day as top meme coins struggled.
The Popcat (POPCAT) token also traded lower, falling by 20% in 24 hours.
A whale has dumped both WIF and POPCAT tokens at a loss.

Dogwifhat ($WIF) and Popcat (POPCAT) are down double-digits in the past 24 hours as the overall meme coins market experiences a significant sell-off.
Dogwifhat sheds 11% amid meme coin slip

Dogwifhat price has declined by 17% in the past week. WIF currently trades at $2.56.

Comparatively, top meme coins Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe and Floki are all green in the last seven days despite shedding gains in the 24-hour period. These tokens are however in the red in the past 24 hours.
Popcat (POPCAT) down 20% in 24 hours
As well as Dogwifthat, another meme token losing by double-digits in the past day and week is Popcat. The Solana internet meme token is down 20% over the last 24 hours to see weekly loses hit 14%.

Popcat’s lack of inherent value is likely to contribute to further price pressures if bears intensify their control in the meme coin market. 
The token changed hands around $0.3, down more than 48% since hitting an all-time high above $0.71 on May 4.
Whale dumps WIF and POPCAT
As noted by Lookonchain, onchain data shows a whale has dumped WIF and POPCAT at a loss just days after splashing on the meme tokens.
The whale bought $2.18 million worth of WIF, acquiring 732,481 WIF tokens at the price of $2.98 three days ago. Data also shows the large meme holder scooped 716,344 POPCAT at $0.5 for a total of $361,000.
Today, the whale dumped 732,481 WIF for $1.85 million and 716,344 $POPCAT for $281,000. This resulted in losses of $336,000 on Dogwifhat and $80,000 on POPCAT.

This is How Much Bitcoin (BTC) El Salvador Has Mined Using Volcanic Energy: Report


																Since 2021 when El Salvador began validating Bitcoin blocks with volcanic energy, the Central American country has mined 474 BTC worth approximately $29.6 million at current prices.
According to a Reuters report, El Salvador mined the cryptocurrencies using a geothermal power plant fueled by the Tecapa volcano in the nation’s east central region.
El Salvador Mines 474 BTC With Volcano
The energy generated from the Tecapa volcano is relatively small, but it powers 300 mining processors installed by El Salvador’s Bitcoin-friendly President Nayib Bukele. The nation dedicated 1.5 megawatts (MW) out of the 102 MW produced by the power plant to crypto mining.
El Salvador’s volcano-powered mining plant presents a sustainable alternative to the electricity-consuming operations of other Bitcoin mining entities, which have been criticized for their negative impacts on power grids and carbon emissions.
Adding the 474 BTC mined since 2021 to the number of bitcoins El Salvador has purchased, the country now holds 5,750 BTC worth roughly $354 million at current prices.




Interestingly, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office revealed that several crypto mining entities, including Foundry USA, Ant pool, ViaBTC, F2Pool, and Binance Pool, joined the resources to win a reward for creating a blockchain that verified Bitcoin transactions validated by the geothermal power plant in the last three years.
El Salvador’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off
El Salvador has come a long way after becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. From using renewable energy sources for mining to launching Bitcoin bonds and offering a citizenship-by-Bitcoin-investment program.
In mid-March, El Salvador’s Bitcoin HODL strategy paid off, with BTC rallying above $70,000. The country began accumulating the digital asset in 2021 and announced in November of the following year that it would buy one BTC every day. Bitcoin’s value hovered around $16,000 at the time of the announcement; however, the asset was worth roughly $63,000 at the time of writing.
CryptoPotato reported that the country’s stash saw a 55% return on investment, registering unrealized gains of about $66 million. Notably, the profits did not account for the nation’s total Bitcoin holdings, as there were assets received through additional revenue streams unknown to the public.

Web3 Watch: Naked in the metaverse - Blockworks


A new crypto-related lawsuit has landed in the Southern District of New York courthouse. 
A California resident named Luke Brown is leading a class action lawsuit against luxury fashion house Dolce & Gabbana over NFTs the company released in 2022. 
Brown’s suit alleges Dolce & Gabbana failed to deliver on benefits it promised for NFT buyers, and manipulated the initial and resale markets for the assets. Brown ultimately lost $5,800 on his $6,000 investment, the suit claims. 
The suit goes on to describe how the DGFamily project, released in collaboration with “digital luxury and culture” marketplace UNXD, failed to deliver on eight promised benefits meant to include digital wearables, physical clothing and access to events. 
Read more: Web3 Watch: Reebok jumps into digital wearable game 
The first digital wearables were delivered roughly a month late, the suit alleges, adding that the collectibles “could be used only in a metaverse platform with barely any users, called DecentraLand.”
The new lawsuit comes shortly after former NFL star Rob Gronkowski paid a $1.9 million settlement over his endorsement of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital.
It also comes as a slew of legacy corporations that unveiled Web3 initiatives during the crypto hype cycle of 2021 and 2022 have continued quietly closing down operations. Starbucks, GameStop, and X are a few recent examples. 
Read more: Web3 Watch: Starbucks shutters its ‘Odyssey’ NFT program
Dolce & Gabbana hasn’t posted about DGFamily on X since April 2023. Its NFTs currently trade hands for a fraction of an ether on OpenSea. The company did not immediately return a request for comment.

Today’s memecoin trading platform of choice, Pump.fun, was exploited for nearly $2 million on Thursday. The Joker-like figure behind the exploit was a rogue employee of the company, Pump.fun said in a Thursday postmortem.

Time will tell whether Pump.fun’s buzzy business will suffer from the exploit, but the effects appeared pretty minimal initially. 
The protocol reactivated trading hours after the exploit, and the day of the exploit was actually Pump.fun’s second-highest revenue day since launching, according to DeFiLlama.  
One interesting stat:

25 Bitcoin Runes were created Friday, down from the thousands created each day in late April, according to a Dune dashboard.

Also of note:

The Roaring Kitty X account posted for the first time since 2021 this week, spurring a raft of meme stock and memecoin speculation.
The Farcaster-influenced Degen chain layer-3 experienced a lengthy chain outage this week.

Tether to Decentralize Financial Markets With New P2P terminal


Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, plans to develop a peer-to-peer financial markets terminal leveraging Holepunch technology.
CEO Paolo Ardoino announced on X that Tether will invest substantial resources into this initiative. 
Tether Plans P2P Financial Markets Terminal

According to Ardoino, the company would aim to replicate USDT’s success within financial markets by eliminating monopolistic intermediaries.

“Any exchange in the world would maximise the revenues from its own data, while keeping direct control of its usage. Financial markets would be much more resilient as a result of this change, and the world would likely be a better place,” Ardoino added.

While specific product details are unavailable, Ardoino indicated that the P2P platform would decentralize financial market data infrastructure. Furthermore, he said the terminal would be built using Holepunch technology.

Holepunch is a platform designed to create apps without requiring centralized data storage, enabling easy deployment. Tether is a significant investor in this technology.
This announcement shows Tether’s strategy to diversify beyond its flagship USDT stablecoin. The company recently restructured its operations into four distinct sectors—finance, data, education, and power.
Tether Finance oversees its multibillion-dollar USDT and other digital assets. Meanwhile, the firm’s Power unit focuses on sustainable Bitcoin mining activities.
Read more: How to Buy and Store the Different Types of Tether
On the other hand, Tether Data will invest in P2P technology and artificial intelligence, with existing investments in Northern Data Group and Holepunch.
Remarkably, Tether acquired a majority stake in brain-computer interface company BlackRock Neurotech via its venture capital division, Tether Evo. Ardoino said this investment showed that the firm believed in nurturing emerging technologies with transformative capabilities.

Meanwhile, these diversification efforts come during Tether’s peak financial performance. During the past year, the firm’s USDT market cap has climbed past $110 billion and generated substantial quarterly profits. Additionally, USDT accounts for around 70% of the stablecoin market, according to DeFillama data.

However, Tether faces increasing regulatory challenges. Reports emerged that the crypto exchange Kraken could delist the stablecoin for its European users. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also recently claimed that the US government might target the stablecoin issuer.

Vitalik Buterin Shares Plans to Improve Ethereum's Decentralization | Cryptopolitan

The highly-respected creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has revealed a comprehensive plan to improve the decentralization and permissionlessness of the network. He detailed these strategies during an Ethereum developer interop in Kenya, explaining to us some significant upcoming improvements like PeerDAS, the Verkle tree transition, and decentralized historical data storage under EIP 4444.These developments promise to enhance the experience not just for node operators but also for L1 and L2 users.Ethereum Will Tackle MEV IssuesButerin’s discourse began with a focus on the broader technical capacities that have recently been enhanced within the Ethereum ecosystem.Related: Why Is Ethereum Still Performing Badly?He responded to concerns from Geth core developer Peter Szilagyi about the current direction of the Ethereum project, which Buterin believes are not as dire as suggested. Instead, he proposed realistic adjustments to the current roadmap to address these issues.Central to Buterin’s argument is the ongoing issue of Miner Extractable Value (MEV). Historically, Ethereum blocks were generated by miners using straightforward algorithms.However, as complex strategies exploiting transaction ordering within blocks emerged, the fairness of block production diminished.To address the rising concerns around MEV, Ethereum has considered both minimizing MEV through protocols like encrypted mempools and quarantining MEV by separating block proposers from transaction selectors via an auction protocol known as proposer/builder separation (PBS).Source: Vitalik ButerinButerin suggests further minimizing the power of builders in MEV scenarios by using inclusion lists. These lists ensure that certain transactions must be included in blocks, thus preventing the possibility of excluding transactions strategically.He advocates for a massive reduction of the builders’ influence, envisioning a scenario where builders are more restricted while maintaining their functionality.Ethereum will Enhance Liquid StakingThe next segment of Buterin’s plan addresses the challenges and future of Ethereum staking.Despite the growth in staking solutions provided by entities like Lido and RocketPool, the majority of Ethereum staking is still not solo due to the 32 ETH minimum and the technical challenges associated.Buterin’s goal is to foster a stronger solo staking ecosystem, which he believes is critical to maintaining Ethereum’s decentralization.Also Read: U.S. Indicts Brothers for Attack on Ethereum Trading BotsHe pointed out several initiatives aimed at reducing the technical and financial barriers to solo staking, including the implementation of Verkle trees and EIP-4444.There is a Need to Reduce Node RequirementsThese technologies could drastically reduce the data storage requirements for nodes, thereby simplifying the staking process and enhancing the viability of Ethereum light clients.Source: Vitalik ButerinButerin also touched on the importance of accessible node operation within the Ethereum network. The ultimate aim is to enable nodes to run on minimal hardware, potentially as low as a smartphone, through improvements like Type 1 ZK-EVMs that allow users to verify blockchain operations without performing the heavy lifting of EVM computation.This vision, often referred to as “The Verge,” aims to decentralize the responsibility of maintaining the state and providing proofs away from large, centralized actors.“I think it is actually true that 2021-era Ethereum thought became too comfortable with offloading responsibilities to a small number of large-scale actors, as long as some kind of market mechanism or zero knowledge proof system existed to force the centralized actors to behave honestly.“Vitalik ButerinDespite these advancements, Buterin remains cautious about the risks of centralization through dependency on a limited number of data providers.He advocates for the storage of historical blockchain data within a decentralized peer-to-peer network, significantly reducing the reliance on major actors like exchanges and block explorers.

Fantom Sonic: Will Ethereum integration help FTM's price? - AMBCrypto



Fantom disclosed that Ethereum would enable the token migration.
While FTM’s price increased, reaching $1 could be challenging in the short term.

Layer-1 blockchain Fantom [FTM] has disclosed a new set of important details as it approaches the final stages before the Sonic upgrade launch.
For those unfamiliar, Sonic upgrade is the next iteration of Fantom that the project claims would boost the number of Transactions Per Second (TPS) to 2000.
However, besides improved performance, the recent upgrade mentioned Ethereum [ETH] as a major player in the development.
Ethereum to aid the switch
According to the memo directed at FTM holders, the project would launch a new layer-1 and layer-2 chain. For both chains, the project said that holders of the token would be able to bridge assets to Ethereum.
It explained,
“The Sonic chain will be a layer-1 platform that connects to Ethereum via a bespoke layer-2 bridge, allowing Sonic to tap into vast amounts of liquidity, users, and protocols. This allows the network to combine the low cost, scalability, and speed of a layer-1 with the security of a layer-2 bridge for access to native ETH and other assets on Ethereum.”
Previously, Fantom had mentioned that it planned to launch a token for the launch with the ticker “S” for Sonic. As such, FTM holders can migrate their tokens to S at a 1:1 ratio using Ethereum.
At press time, FTM’s price was $0.86— A 6.22% increase in the last 24 hours. The price increase could be linked to the rising optimism geared toward the upgrade and token introduction.
Furthermore, AMBCrypto noticed that the 24-hour active addresses on the Fantom jumped on the 17th of May. The increase implied that the rate of successful transactions on the network jumped.
Source: Santiment
However, the metric, at press time, had decreased, implying that the increase lasted only for a short period. Likewise, on-chain data showed that the one-day circulation fell.
Network activity struggles to hold up
As of this writing, FTM circulation was 2.97 million, confirming the notion that tokens engaged in transactions had reduced.
If these metrics continue to fall, it could be difficult for FTM’s price to approach $1.
But that does not imply that the value would not increase. At the same, a significant plunge could be off the option. In addition, we looked at the Total Value Locked (TVL).
According to DeFiLlama, Fantom’s TVL was  $133.38 million. This was a significant increase in the last 30 days. The increase indicated an improvement in the health of protocols operating under the chain.
Source: DeFiLlama

Realistic or not, here’s FTM’s market cap in ETH terms

However, this value remains a low one compared to 2022 when the metric hit an incredible $7 billion. As it stands, it could be difficult for Fantom to experience that level of locked assets again.
But when it launches the Sonic upgrade, trust might return to the chain, it could experience a notable influx of assets deposited.

Here's when Solana could hit $200


Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, has surged over 17% in the last week to reach around $171 at press time. The cryptocurrency‘s monthly returns stand at around 30%, outperforming most big-cap crypto rivals, including Bitcoin (BTC). 
This strong performance has fueled optimism that SOL could soon target the $200 mark.
The uptick in SOL’s value can be attributed to several factors, including bustling meme coin trading, strong stablecoin volumes, and decentralized finance (DeFi) activity. 


Additionally, declining U.S. bond yields indicate a growing appetite for riskier assets like crypto.
Moreover, Robinhood has broadened its crypto services to Europe, launching its first crypto-staking product. This new feature allows European customers to stake Solana through the app for a 5% yield.
This move has boosted investor confidence in Solana, highlighting its potential and stability.
Rising interest in Solana NFTs
In a significant shift within the decentralized exchange (DEX) sector, Solana has recently outpaced Ethereum (ETH) in daily trading volumes, sparking discussions about its potential to challenge Ethereum’s long-established dominance in the cryptocurrency market.
Solana has seen a notable increase in first-time wallets interacting with its NFTs over the past week, particularly within top collections. 
Data from Tiexo shows a slight uptick in Solana NFT volumes, primarily driven by these collections. The number of unique wallets has risen by 159% over the last seven days, reaching about 180,000. 
The most significant growth came from first-time wallets, which surged by over 39% to exceed 56,000. 
This increase in activity indicates a growing interest and engagement in the Solana NFT ecosystem, underscoring the platform’s expanding appeal among new users.

Choung pointed to forthcoming network enhancements, such as the highly anticipated Firedancer, a secondary chain client created by Jump Crypto designed to boost the network’s efficiency, as key factors driving this optimism.

Currently, SOL is changing hands at $171. Analysts predict that a successful breakout could push its valuation close to $190, and an eventual move toward the $200 resistance level is within reach. 
Should the bullish momentum continue, SOL might even hit $250 in the next upward run. Conversely, a market downturn could see SOL retract to the $155 support line.
 If bearish trends prevail, the price may drop to $150, indicating a bearish shift. 
Despite potential setbacks, the current recovery trends suggest that SOL is well-positioned for further gains, pointing to a promising outlook for the altcoin.

XRP price prediction for May 31 as Ripple records Q1 impressive growth


Despite ongoing legal troubles, blockchain firm Ripple recorded impressive growth in the first quarter of 2024, hitting several milestones.
According to the results report released by Ripple on May 17, XRP spot volumes surged 40% from Q4 2023 to reach $865 million in Q1 2024. Daily average XRP derivatives open interest also increased, rising to $500 million from $460 million in Q4 2023.

On-chain transactions grew by 108%, climbing to 251,397,881 from 121,031,713 recorded the previous quarter. Additionally, XRP burned for transaction fees rose by 101%, from 317,271 in Q4 2023 to 636,184 in the first quarter of 2024.


These results potentially highlight the strength of Ripple’s underlying business despite the company’s legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These positive metrics are likely to influence XRP’s valuation, potentially impacting its price trajectory.
Currently, XRP is holding the $0.50 support zone, largely remaining in a consolidation zone below $0.60. Investors are keenly watching for catalysts that could help the token rally to the coveted $1 mark.
XRP price prediction
In examining the XRP price prediction, Finbold consulted the CoinCodex tool, which uses AI-powered machine-learning algorithms for price projection. 
According to data retrieved on May 18, the tool projected that XRP is likely to experience bullish momentum and trade at $0.66 by May 31, representing an upside of over 26% from XRP’s current price.

Meanwhile, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto noted in a May 18 X post that XRP is poised for sustained bullish momentum in the coming days. According to the analyst, XRP is facing the “final wake-up line,” which saw the token break out in July 2023 but failed to reach the anticipated heights.
The trading expert highlighted a new development: a white triangle pattern incorporating highs from 2021, introducing the “genuine wake-up line.” Consequently, the expert predicted a breakout around $1.50, with a more ambitious target of $7.50.

The Most Outrageous Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions This Year


																TL;DR

XRP trades around $0.52, with some analysts predicting potential rises to $5.85, $18.22, and even up to $100, although extreme targets are unlikely.
The ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC significantly affects the asset’s price, with the company’s partial court wins boosting optimism for a potential bull run.


The Odds of a Ridiculous XRP Rally
Despite a brief price surge above $0.70 in mid-March, Ripple’s XRP has not positioned itself among the best-performing cryptocurrencies this year. It currently trades at around $0.52 (per CoinGecko’s data), which is a minor increase compared to the figure witnessed a month ago. 
Numerous analysts believe the asset can break out of its current price position and head toward somewhat outrageous targets. One example is the X user Dark Defender, who thinks XRP can rise to $5.85 and later to a whopping $18.22:
“As long as these are maintained, our 5 Elliott Wave structure targeting $5.85 & $18.22 remains the same. And any further moves between $0.3917 to $0.6649 are side moves and are normal.”
Earlier this year, the analyst set an ever more ambitious target of $20, while EGRAG CRYPTO warned the XRP army to “stay steady” since a price “ignition” might be on the horizon.
One of the most bullish price predictions this year was outlined by JackTheRippler, who forecasted an ascent to a whopping $100.




Still, none of the aforementioned can be compared to CryptoBull’s analysis from 2023. Back then, the X user suggested that XRP may skyrocket to a staggering $470 sometime in the future.
It is worth mentioning that this level would most likely remain a mirage since the asset’s market capitalization should explode above $200 trillion for this to happen. Currently, the entire market cap of the crypto industry stands at “just” $2.5 trillion. 
The Impact of the Ripple v SEC Lawsuit
Many consider the lawsuit between the two entities a major factor contributing to XRP’s price movements. The case, which started in December 2020, recently entered its trial phase, and some view the US SEC as the underdog due to Ripple’s three partial court wins secured throughout 2023. 
The legal battle has undergone numerous developments recently, and according to the American lawyer Jeremy Hogan, both parties now expect the judge’s ruling.
A decisive victory for Ripple may resonate into a bull run for XRP, while the opposite scenario could halt the asset’s upward movements as it did back in December 2020 when the agency initially went after the company.

These Are The 28 Altcoins Binance Has Invested In But Hasn't Listed Yet - Bitcoin Sistemi


Binance Labs, the investment arm of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has been investing in many altcoin projects recently.
However, Binance does not yet list many of the altcoins it invests in on its exchange platform. Although Binance's investment in a project does not guarantee listing on the exchange, data indicates that the company is more likely to list the altcoins it has invested in.


So, which are the altcoins that Binance has invested in but has not yet listed on the stock market? Here is the list:

GPT
PBUX
HIP
ZK
CHAMP
PEEL
LFT
SQR
OLE
APX
PSTAKE
OOE
FOG
GMEE
MAVIA
NCG
FAQ
BBS
D.F.D.
BUNNY
PUSH
CQT
MATH
RWA
HOPR
NYM
CERE
MOB


Particularly noteworthy tokens in this list include MAVIA, CQT and NYM. The reason why these tokens attract attention is that their total market value is over 100 million dollars. Predictably, Binance is more willing to list high-cap tokens.





The world's largest cryptocurrency exchange has been making many listings via Launchpools lately. The last example of this was Notcoin (NOT). However, the NOT rewards were disappointing, paying out only $1.5 per approximately $1000 staked.

‘Godfather of AI’ advises UK government to start UBI

Geoffrey Hinton, a world-renowned artificial intelligence (AI) expert often referred to as the “Godfather of AI,” recently consulted with members of the United Kingdom’s government at Downing Street where he advised lawmakers to consider adopting a universal basic income (UBI) to deal with the impending threat of job loss.Until recently, Hinton worked for Google developing high-level AI features for neural networks — the underlying technology that powers most modern generative AI systems such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.According to Hinton, the AI revolution will mostly benefit the rich. Laypersons, blue collar workers, and those employed in jobs that can be automated stand to lose their means of income and “that’s going to be bad for society” he recently told the BBC in an interview.“I was consulted by people in Downing Street,” said Hinton, “and I advised them that universal basic income was a good idea.”Hinton isn’t the only major player in the field of AI who believes that we’ll need UBI to offset the impact automation will have on the human economy.Prior to becoming one of the most famous CEOs in the tech industry, OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman studied under Hinton and helped pioneer the neural network. These days, Altman is known for his tenure as OpenAI’s top brass as well as his full-throated support for UBI.Altman's other venture, Worldcoin, is focused on providing UBI through the adoption of a cryptocurrency token provided free of charge to anyone who signs up for the service and submits to a retinal scan to verify their identity.Aside from saving humanity from employment displacement through the advent of UBI, both Hinton and Altman have expressed their belief that AI could pose an existential threat to humanity.Hinton reportedly left his post at Google so that he could speak more freely about his concerns over the impact AI could have on the future of our species. And Altman, for his part, claims the entire reason he co-founded OpenAI with Elon Musk and others was to ensure that advanced AI systems were developed carefully and for the benefit of humanity.In his recent BBC interview, Hinton said we may only have a handful of years before the threat becomes imminent:“My guess is in between five and 20 years from now there’s a probability of half that we’ll have to confront the problem of AI trying to take over.”Related: AI safety researchers leave OpenAI over prioritization concerns

XRP Q1 Report Reveals Booming Usage Despite 5% Price Slide - DailyCoin


        

The price of XRP has dipped in Q1 2024, but its usage has skyrocketed.



Spot volume has surged by double digits while on-chain transactions have exploded by over 100%.



With a controlled token release and a dynamic network, could XRP be poised for a future upswing?




Fintech giant Ripple’s Q1 2024 report has painted a curious picture for XRP. Although the native token of the XRP Ledger has experienced a slight price dip in the first quarter of 2024, its usage statistics have told a completely different story. Here’s why this disconnect deserves a deeper dive.



XRP in Action



Forget price charts for a moment. The real story lies in how people are using XRP. Q1 2024 saw a staggering 40% increase in spot volume, reaching a cool $865 million. This translates to a significant jump in actual XRP being traded, not just paper shuffling by investors. 







On-chain transactions, which represent the actual movement of XRP on the Ripple network, exploded by a massive 108%, surpassing 251 million.This surge in activity isn’t just about volume. Interestingly, the average cost per XRP transaction dropped a sweet 44% compared to the previous quarter. 




This makes using XRP for everyday transactions even more attractive. Could this be a sign of wider adoption beyond simply trading? The amount of XRP “burned” for transaction fees. This number spiked by 101%, indicating a healthy level of network activity. Think of burning as a way to keep the XRP ecosystem clean and efficient, similar to how pruning strengthens a garden.



The Price Dip: A Temporary Blip?



So, why has the price declined amidst all this positive activity? The answer might lie in broader market fluctuations or the ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Investors may be adopting a wait-and-see approach, causing a temporary price dip.



Ripple’s report on their XRP holdings offers further insight. The majority of XRP is held in escrow, slowly released over time. This controlled release could help prevent market saturation and contribute to long-term price stability.




The Q1 report paints a picture of a dynamic XRP ecosystem, even amidst a price dip. The surge in transaction volume, lower costs, and healthy burn rate all suggest a network that’s being actively used. 



While the price decline deserves attention, it shouldn’t overshadow the underlying strength of the XRP ecosystem. For investors, this might be a time for cautious optimism, with a close eye on both the legal battle and continued network development.



On the Flipside




The wider cryptocurrency market experienced a correction in Q1 2024, which could be a contributing factor to the XRP price dip.



The ongoing lawsuit by the SEC against Ripple casts a shadow of uncertainty over the future of XRP.



The controlled release of XRP from escrow could continue to put downward pressure on the price in the short term.




Why This Matters



This disconnect between XRP’s rising usage and falling price raises questions about the short-term impact of market sentiment versus the long-term potential of a network with demonstrably increasing utility. Understanding this dynamic could be crucial for investors seeking to navigate the often-contradictory forces at play in the cryptocurrency market.

Floki Inu Frenzy: Memecoin Eyes New Highs as OI Soars


																Floki Inu (FLOKI), the Shiba Inu-inspired memecoin, has rocketed into the spotlight with a surge in trading activity and a nearly 20% price increase in the past week. However, experts caution that this “pup-ularity” might be short-lived, fueled more by hype than by strong foundations.

Open Interest Takes Off: Newcomers Flock To FLOKI
The key indicator driving excitement is the skyrocketing Futures Open Interest for FLOKI. According to Coinglass, this figure, which reflects the number of outstanding futures contracts, has climbed a staggering 110% since May 1st, reaching a 30-day high of nearly $20 million. This suggests a surge of new market participants entering FLOKI positions, potentially anticipating further price increases.
Source: Coinglass
Adding fuel to the fire is the significant rise in FLOKI’s daily trading volume. On May 15th, Santiment reported a daily volume exceeding $1 billion, marking the highest level for FLOKI since late March. This intense buying activity indicates a surge in investor interest, pushing the price upwards.
Source: Santiment
Momentum Indicators Point To A Bullish Charge
Further bolstering the case for a bullish FLOKI is the behavior of its key momentum indicators. Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Money Flow Index (MFI) currently sit comfortably above their neutral lines, at 62.68 and 65.37 respectively. In simpler terms, these metrics suggest that the price momentum leans towards further gains in the short term.

Also, the broader market sentiment surrounding FLOKI is notably positive. Increased trading volumes and a surge in social media mentions have amplified investor interest, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is gaining traction not just among retail traders but also institutional investors.
Recent partnerships and strategic developments within the FLOKI ecosystem are likely to fuel further growth. These factors, combined with the strong technical indicators, paint a promising picture for FLOKI’s near-term performance, potentially paving the way for substantial price appreciation.

However, beneath the shiny exterior lies a potential cause for concern. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), an indicator that measures the buying and selling pressure of an asset, paints a rather bearish picture.
Still In Negative Zone
Despite the price appreciation, FLOKI’s CMF remains firmly in negative territory, currently hovering around -0.11. This suggests that even though the price is rising, the buying pressure might be weakening.
This divergence between price and buying pressure is often seen as a sign of a potential reversal, indicating a rally driven by short-term speculation rather than long-term investor confidence.

While FLOKI’s recent performance is undeniably impressive, the underlying factors suggest a potentially volatile future. The surge in open interest and trading volume hints at a market frenzy, but the negative CMF raises concerns about the rally’s sustainability.

Ripple Market Report: Why Is XRP Volume Getting The Spotlight?


								Cryptocurrency payment company Ripple has released XRP’s market report for the first quarter of 2024. The report sheds light on XRP’s soaring trading volume. It also highlights updates on the on-chain performance and recent technical developments of the XRPL ecosystem. 

XRP Spot Volume Surges
According to the Q1 2024 XRP market report published officially on Ripple’s website on May 17, the total volume of Centralized Exchanges (CEX) in March has surged to unprecedented levels, recording an increase to $2.93 trillion in spot volumes and a $9.1 trillion in derivatives volume. 
On the other hand, the weekly volumes of Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) have spiked by 100% to $40 billion over the fourth quarter of 2023. 
Amidst the crypto market’s overperformance, XRP recorded a rise in average daily volumes. The cryptocurrency surged to $865 million in Q1 2024, a 40% increase from Q4 2023. The daily average XRP derivatives open interest increased from $460 million in Q4 2023 to $500 million in Q1 2024. 
XRP’s market report revealed that towards the end of Q1 of 2024, the cryptocurrency had exhibited a “high correlation with the general market,” emphasizing XRP’s increased trading activities and robust engagement. However, at the beginning of Q1 2024, particularly in March and February, XRP witnessed a significant decline. 
The cryptocurrency hit a low point in mid-February and peaked in March, highlighting a gradual decline to a potential bottom triggered by volatility. Following this downturn, XRP quickly recovered towards the end of March; however, its volatility levels were still as high as ever, recording a high of 90%. 
The report also disclosed several exchanges that contributed to XRP’s increased volume. The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, contributed a significant volume of XRP, while the combination of Bitstamp and Upbit accounted for a large percentage of XRP’s spot volume. 
Moreover, XRP’s distribution volume has remained relatively constant throughout the first quarter of 2024. Binance, Bybit, and Upbit have been responsible for more than 70% of the total trading volume in XRP during this period. 
XRP is currently trading at $0.52. Chart: TradingView
On-Chain Transactions Skyrocket
In addition to its increased volume in Q1 2024, XRP has also witnessed an increase in on-chain activity. On-chain transactions skyrocketed to $231.3 million in Q1 2024 from $121 million in Q4 2023, reflecting more than a 108% increase Quarter over Quarter (QoQ).
The average cost per transaction also decreased by 45% during this period. Additionally, the XRP burned for transaction fees surged by more than 101%, totaling 636,184 in 2024. 
Furthermore, the volume on DEX (in USD) rose by over 5%, recording $57.6 million in Q1 2024 from $54.9 million in Q4 2023. 

While recording an increase in on-chain activity, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem also witnessed a significant spike in developmental activities. Earlier this year, XRPL integrated Axelar, a multi-chain platform, to improve interoperability and expand XRPL’s features across more than 55 blockchains.
Moreover, XRPL partnered with EasyA, a leading Web3 app, to deploy decentralized applications (DApps) with intelligent contract capabilities on the ledger.

Venezuela to shut down cryptocurrency mining farms


Venezuela’s Ministry of Electric Power announced it would disconnect all cryptocurrency mining farms from the national power grid (SEN, Sistema Electrico Nacional). The measure aims to control the high energy demand from these mining farms and ensure reliable service for citizens.
AlbertoNews, a local media outlet, reported the announcement on May 18.

“The purpose is to disconnect all cryptocurrency mining farms in the country from the SEN [National Electrical System], avoiding the high impact on demand, which allows us to continue offering an efficient and reliable service to all the Venezuelan people,” 
the Ministry reported in its account in Instagram.



Notably, the announcement followed the seizure of 2,000 cryptocurrency mining machines in the country. This action is part of the government’s ongoing anti-corruption campaign. Leading to the arrests of several officials from state institutions.
Corruption with the National Superintendency of Cryptoassets
The National Superintendency of Cryptoassets (Sunacrip) has been under a restructuring board since the arrest of Superintendent Joselit Ramírez. Ramírez has connections to Tareck El Aissami, former Petroleum Minister and former president of Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).
On that note, El Aissami was charged with treason, embezzlement, misuse of influence, money laundering, and criminal association.
Venezuela power grid issues and cryptocurrency mining
Venezuela has faced an ongoing electricity crisis since 2009, worsened by massive blackouts in 2019 that left cities without power for up to seven days. Frequent power outages have negatively affected the country’s quality of life and economic activities.
Therefore, Governor of Carabobo state, Rafael Lacava confirmed restrictions on cryptocurrency mining farms due to their significant electricity consumption. He urged residents to report illegal cryptocurrency mining operations to prevent power shortages.

“If you, neighbor, see a house that you know, tell that person to turn off the farm, or else report it, because when they turn off the light, because you have to give light to a man so that he can earn some reales (money), you are left without electrical service.”
– Rafael Lacava

As reported by AlbertoNews, experts attribute the crisis to poor maintenance and inadequate investment in the power grid. Meanwhile, the government blames sabotage and has promised to modernize the state-controlled power network.
Overall, Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency mining are known worldwide for their high energy consumption. Countries like China and Cazaquistan have banned the activity to preserve their power grids, centralizing mining in fewer locations.
Therefore, the fewer countries allowing this activity, the higher the security concerns will be, as a few miners dominate block discovery.

Ethereum ETFs progress, but Solana may turn things bearish instead - How? - AMBCrypto



New data indicated that the likelihood of approval of Ethereum ETFs was relatively high.
Ethereum lost market share to Solana, however, the price of ETH continued to surge.

Ethereum [ETH] has been under a lot of heat due to the rising speculations around the dismissal of the approval of Ethereum ETFs.
Uncertainty around ETFs
While there is uncertainty regarding timely approval due to the SEC’s silence, it’s a matter of when, not if, a U.S. spot ETH ETF will be approved, according to Coinbase’s data.
However, potential justifications for disapproval may stem from differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin [BTC], particularly Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism.
Clear regulatory guidance on asset staking is lacking, making it unlikely that spot ETH ETFs enabling staking will be approved soon. Despite this, it is believed that unstaked ETH should not be impacted.
There is potential for a positive surprise in the approval decision, with odds estimated around 30-40%.
Considering crypto’s emergence as an election issue, the SEC may hesitate to deny approval, and litigation could overturn a rejection.
Additionally, not all spot ETH ETF applications need to be approved simultaneously, as noted by Commissioner Uyeda’s statement regarding spot BTC ETF approval.
Stiff competition
Even though the possibility of approval of Ethereum ETF’s was high, there were some other challenges that the Ethereum network would be facing. Especially, competition from other Layer 1 chains.
In terms of adoption, the emergence of highly scalable integrated chains, especially Solana [SOL], seems to be impacting Ethereum’s dominance.
With its ability to handle a large number of transactions at low fees, Solana has shifted the focus of trading activity away from the Ethereum mainnet.
Over the past year, Solana’s ecosystem has seen remarkable growth, increasing its share of decentralized exchange (DEX) volume from just 2% to 21%.
Source: Coinbase
Moreover, the increasing popularity of memecoins on the Solana network are also driving users away from Ethereum and towards Solana.

Despite these factors, the price of ETH has seen some positive movement. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,117.82 which was a result of a 2.11% appreciation in the last 24 hours.
Even though the price of ETH was rising, its Network Growth declined, indicating waning interest from new users.

Approval in Expected Cryptocurrency Lawsuit: $3 Billion to be Distributed to Users - Bitcoin Sistemi

In a landmark ruling, Genesis, a bankrupt cryptocurrency lender, has received court approval to distribute billions of dollars in digital assets and cash to its creditors.
Late Friday, Judge Sean Lane approved Genesis' Chapter 11 repayment plan, which includes a unique structure for returning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to creditors. This decision paves the way for Genesis to return customer assets that have been frozen on the platform since November 2022 following the collapse of other major crypto firms.


Judge Lane dismissed DCG's legal challenge in a sweeping 135-page decision, stating that Genesis' parent company lacked legal standing to challenge the Chapter 11 plan. As the equity owner of Genesis, DCG is last in line for repayment in Chapter 11. Judge Lane stated that any value that the company's bankrupt subsidiary was required to distribute was absorbed by creditors who were not fully repaid and stood before DCG.
“Given the magnitude of the creditors' claims, DCG is left out as a multi-billion dollar capital holder,” Judge Lane said.





DCG had argued that the plan provided an unacceptable benefit to Genesis creditors at its own detriment. The parent company insisted creditor claims should be determined by where crypto prices stood when its subsidiary filed for bankruptcy in early 2023. At the time, Bitcoin was trading around $24,000, and on Friday it was above $66,700.
DCG may appeal Judge Lane's decision.



Genesis estimates that creditors who loaned it digital assets could receive up to 77% repayment under its proposal, but significantly less if DCG prevails. The bankrupt company's bid has received broad support from its creditors, which include customers of Gemini Earn, a lending program run in partnership with Gemini, the billionaire Winklevoss brothers' company.
Judge Lane also said he would approve a settlement involving New York Attorney General Letitia James, who sued Genesis over the Earn program. The deal is structured so that assets that might otherwise go to state authorities are instead returned to former Earn customers.

‘46 Times Faster Than Ethereum’ - Solana Races to the Top of CoinGecko’s List of Swiftest Blockchains - The Daily Hodl


								Smart contract platform Solana (SOL) is moving to the top of CoinGecko’s list of fastest blockchains.
In a new publication, CoinGecko says Solana is a staggering 46 times faster than its rival Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest digital asset by market cap, making it the fastest large blockchain on the market.










However, CoinGecko says that Solana has only reached 1.6% of its theoretical maximum throughput.
 “Solana has proven to be the fastest among large blockchains, with its actual daily average transactions per second (TPS) reaching a record high of 1,504 on April 6th this year amid the memecoin mania. 
This makes Solana 46 times faster than Ethereum, and more than five times faster than Polygon, which has the highest TPS among Ethereum scaling solutions.
Despite ranking as the fastest blockchain, Solana has still only achieved 1.6% of its theoretical maximum speed of 65,000 TPS.”
CoinGecko’s statistics show that Solana’s highest throughput was 1,053.7 TPS while Ethereum’s was just 22.70 TPS. The data also shows that Ethereum and its top 10 layer-2 scaling solutions only combine for 500 TPS.
 “Altogether, Ethereum and its ten largest scaling solutions registered a total real TPS of 500, placing their combined processing speed ahead of BSC (Binance Smart Chain) but still slower than Solana and Sui.” 
Other fast blockchains on the list include Sui Network (SUI) Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon (MATIC), Toncoin (TON), Tron (TRON), Near Protocol (NEAR) and Avalanche (AVAX).
Solana is trading for $172 at time of writing, a 7.63% increase during the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin fees hit 3-month low: A $12M drop, explained - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s total fees have dropped to a three-month low.
Due to this, miners’ revenue derived from fees has declined.

Bitcoin [BTC] network fees have fallen to a record low as the Layer 1 (L1) transaction volume continues to decline.
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), on-chain data provider IntoTheBlock noted that transaction fees on the Bitcoin network plunged to their lowest level in three months this week.
 Recording a weekly transaction fee totaling $12 million, the network saw a 45% decline from the previous week. 
State of the network
This week’s decline in the Bitcoin network’s fee is due to the decrease in its transaction volume.
 According to Santiment’s data, the aggregate amount of BTC across all transactions completed on the network fell steadily during the week. 
Between the 11th and the 17th of May, Bitcoin’s transaction volume plummeted by 5%.
Source: Santiment
The average fee paid per transaction dropped as the network saw a decline in demand. According to Messari, this decreased by 17% during the period under review. 
At press time, the average cost of executing a transaction on the Bitcoin network was $2.56.
The miners on Bitcoin’s network are the primary victims of its low network fees.
 After the percentage of miner revenue derived from transaction fees rallied to a year-to-date high of 75% on the 20th of April, post-halving event, it has since declined significantly. 
Source: Messari
As of this writing, only 4% of miner revenue is derived from the fees paid by Bitcoin’s users. This marked a 95% decline from the YTD high, per Messari’s data. 
Miners offload coins to prevent losses
Low revenue and BTC’s recent price troubles have forced some miners to sell their holdings.
 AMBCrypto assessed Bitcoin’s Miner Supply Ratio and found that it has fallen by 0.21% since the halving event. 
This metric measures miners’ BTC holdings relative to the coin’s total supply. When it declines this way, miners are selling a larger portion of their mined coins. 
This is often due to capitulation from high operational costs, the desire to take profit, or a lack of confidence in the coin’s price.

BTC sell-offs among miners on its network have led to a depletion of the coin’s Miner Reserve. This measures the amount of coins held in miners’ wallets within a specified period.

According to CryptoQuant’s data, BTC’s Miner Reserve, at 1.81 million at press time, has dropped by 1% since the 25th of April.

CryptoQuant CEO Maps Out Path Forward for Bitcoin Bull Cycle - Here’s When He Thinks It Will End - The Daily Hodl


								The head of blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant thinks Bitcoin (BTC) is only halfway through its current bull cycle.
Ki Young Ju tells his 346,000 followers on the social media platform X that BTC’s market cap is growing faster than its realized cap, a trend he says tends to last around two years.










The realized cap metric records the price of each Bitcoin when it last moved and aims to gauge how many holders are in profit or at a loss.
Explains Young Ju,
“If this pattern continues, the bull cycle might end by April 2025.”
Source: Ki Young Ju/X
BTC is trading at $67,014 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 2% in the past 24 hours and more than 10% in the past seven days.
Young Ju’s firm, CryptoQuant, notes that short-term holders are selling Bitcoin at low or negative profits. The firm says traders have exhausted their unrealized profits, which has decreased selling pressure in the BTC market.
Source: CryptoQuant/X
CryptoQuant also notes that Bitcoin balances at over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks have stabilized, which means less supply is entering the market.
Source: CryptoQuant/X
The analytics firm does caution that BTC demand from permanent holders and large investors “needs to accelerate to sustain the price rally.”

Whopping 97% Transaction Count Plunge Faced by Shibarium, What's Happening?

While the Shiba Inu developer team continues to work and add important upgrades to the Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium keeps seeing a drastic plunge in transaction activity — it has been going for almost a month already.This has coincided with a plunge in the SHIB burn rate as this metric found itself in the red today.Shibarium faces enormous activity plungeAccording to data publicly shared by the Shibariumscan explorer, the Layer-2 blockchain of the popular meme cryptocurrency Shiba Inu, Shibarium, continues to lack transaction activity. For almost a month, the plunge has been astounding — almost 100%.Compared to a high of 562,990 daily transactions detected on Shibarium on April 17, today’s number equals merely 16,800.Still, the overall number of transactions continues to grow, albeit slowly. By now, this metric demonstrates 417,469,578 transfers made in total since the blockchain’s launch in August last year.Earlier this week, the enigmatic leader of Shiba Inu known as Shytoshi Kusama announced the launch of a new version of the ShibaSwap DEX and its bridging to Shibarium from the Ethereum chain. This move enables its users to be exposed to a wide range of products and services on both blockchains. This partly explains the low level of transaction activity on Shibarium at the moment.Grok AI has a say about Shibarium and ShibaSwapOn Friday, the official marketing lead of the SHIB team, Lucie, tested the Grok AI bot about what it knows about the ShibaSwap DEX launching on Shibarium. Elon Musk’s AI provided a humorous breakdown of the DEX for Lucie.Grok jokingly likened the expansion of the DEX from Ethereum to Shibarium to “moving from a crowded city to a peaceful suburb with better infrastructure and lower fees.” The outcome of this, per the AI, is “Faster transactions and lower costs for all you SHIB enthusiasts out there.” The program also revealed what it believes to be “the most exciting feature” of ShibaSwap. That is the ability to make up new liquidity pools on Shibarium. Another new feature brought by the DEX to Shibarium is discovery charts and trending tokens.Grok eventually concluded that “the new and improved ShibaSwap on Shibarium offers faster transactions, lower fees, new liquidity pools, and enhanced token discovery.”

Ethereum ETFs About to Be Approved? - Here are the Candidates Waiting for Confirmation ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
All eyes are on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for approving the Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Following the groundbreaking approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, the anticipation for Ethereum ETFs is palpable, with major investment firms waiting for confirmation.



BlackRock



Leading the charge is BlackRock, the world’s largest investment management company, which submitted an S-1 form for its iShares Ethereum Trust. With CEO Larry Fink believing in Ethereum’s potential, BlackRock’s entry into the Ethereum ETF market shows the huge institutional interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency.



Grayscale



Meanwhile, Grayscale, a prominent crypto asset manager, awaits the SEC’s response to its proposal to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF. Having paved the way for Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., Grayscale will directly compete with BlackRock for the best ETF provider.



Ark 21Shares



ARK Invest, in collaboration with crypto ETF issuer 21Shares, has also entered the fray, filing for an Ethereum ETF with Coinbase as the trustee. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest is known for its innovative investment strategies, and its entry into Ethereum ETFs reflects the increasing demand for crypto investments.



Fidelity, VanEck, and Hashdex



Fidelity, another major player in the financial industry, signaled its interest in Ethereum ETFs by filing for a product with the SEC through Cboe.

&nbsp



The same goes for VanEck. An established asset manager, it was the first to send its proposal for an Ethereum ETF, but it later withdrew it in 2021.



Brazilian asset manager Hashdex, in partnership with Nasdaq, applied for a Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, leveraging its success with crypto ETFs in Brazil.



Franklin Templeton, Invesco Galaxy, and Bitwise



Franklin Templeton’s proposal for a Franklin Ethereum Trust includes staking as part of its investment strategy. With staking gaining popularity in the crypto space, Franklin Templeton is looking to present a unique value proposition and offer more opportunities to its investors.



Invesco, Galaxy Digital, and Bitwise have also submitted proposals for Ethereum ETFs, adding to the growing list of contenders awaiting SEC approval.



While the SEC’s decisions on these proposals are eagerly awaited, industry experts anticipate a potential launch of Ethereum ETFs by the end of the year. If approved, Ethereum ETFs could open up new avenues for mainstream investors to participate in the crypto market and have a huge impact on the market, potentially sending it to new highs.

Solana Price Absolutely Primed To Hit $200 By Month End With All-Time High To Follow, Says Market Guru ⋆ ZyCrypto


            
            
Advertisement

&nbsp

&nbsp
Solana’s native token, SOL, is leading the recent recovery in crypto prices, outshining most of its large-cap crypto rivals, including Bitcoin (BTC), and signaling that the bulls are attempting a huge comeback. A hedge fund founder sees the prospect of SOL surging to the $200 price tag by the end of this month.



$200 SOL Within Reach



Solana’s SOL has surged over 3.8% in the last 24 hours to reach $175.79 on May 18 — its highest level in over a month. The token’s monthly returns stand at around 33.5%. On the weekly timeframe, SOL’s 20.7% leap was the largest among the top 15 coins and tokens by market cap.



Daniel Cheung, the co-founder of digital asset hedge fund Syncracy Capital, posited on the X micro-blogging site, “Strength on SOL has been incredible on this bounce. Very clear this is still the best trade of this cycle.”



Cheung revealed that he is “much more confident” that the price of SOL could reclaim the $200 mark by the end of this month and rocket to new historic highs “soon.”







SOL set its current record high of $259.96 in November 2021 — about 32.8% higher than the current price — during the peak of the previous bull market. The cryptocurrency crashed to as low as nearly $8 in December 2022 following the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire but has rebounded drastically since. It’s up a whopping 739.2% in the past year alone.

&nbsp



The uptick in SOL’s value so far in May can be linked to several factors, including a rise in Solana-based meme coins that are riding the latest wave of crypto hype, growing decentralized finance (DeFi) trading volume, and positive news in the Solana ecosystem. Trading platform Robinhood recently launched its first SOL-staking product for European customers. The rollout boosted investor confidence in Solana, as being featured by a leading brokerage like Robinhood is considered a validation of the crypto’s potential and strength.



Cheung highlighted forthcoming upgrades laying the groundwork for the much-awaited Firedancer upgrade — an entirely new independent client scheduled for release later this year — as another reason to be hopeful for Solana’s price.

Bitcoin Breakout From Major Resistance Levels Signals Bullish Momentum | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin which has been moving downward for a while now has managed to break above its previous resistance level of $67,303.98 and has been showing signs of a potential rally ever since.
At the time of writing, the price of BTC is up by 0.04%, and it is currently trading at around $67,303.98. BTC’s price is showing bullish signs and also forming a base above the $64,554.45 resistance level.
The price is trading above both the bearish trend line and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) both on the 4-hour chart and the daily chart suggesting a bullish signal. This can be seen in the image below.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour timeframe also suggests that the price of BTC is bullish as the RSI line is trending close to the overbought session above the 50% level. According to the RSI, the price might make a little consolidation before continuing in the upward direction. 
Furthermore, the 1-D MACD also indicates a bullish momentum as the MACD histograms are already trending above the zero line, while the MACD line and the MACD signal line have crossed each other and are heading towards the MACD zero line. If both the MACD line and the MACD signal line successfully cross above the MACD zero line, then the price is expected to move further upward.
1-Day Alligator: Finally, it can be observed that the price of Bitcoin has successfully crossed above the William Alligator indicator. Both the Alligator jaw and lip have crossed above the alligator teeth suggesting the start of an upward movement.

What Could Happen If Bitcoin Continues To Surge Upward?
There are two levels of resistance $67,267.79 and $71,337.80. If Bitcoin’s price continues to surge upward with this momentum and breaks above the $67,267.79 resistance level, the price could move further toward the $71,337.80 resistance level. A breakout from this resistance level would see prices rising significantly, probably to set a new high for the year.
What If The Price Declines?
If the price fails to break above these resistance levels mentioned above, Bitcoin will continue to move downward. There are currently three main support levels for BTC, which are $64,554.45, $60,137.39, and $56,540.64.
Should the price manage to continue in a downward direction, it will move toward the $64,554.45 support level. And if this level fails to hold the price, it might move even further to test both the $60,137.39 and $56,540.64 support levels.

The Big Day for the Cryptocurrency Market is Just 4 Days Away: Two Analysts Explain Their Views - Bitcoin Sistemi

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will make an important decision on the approval of Ethereum ETFs within the next week. However, according to Ric Edelman, President of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, the lack of a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies could lead to a negative outcome.
Edelman, a famous investor and personal finance writer, expects another delay in the decision. “I think there will be another delay, which obviously isn't all bad news,” he said in an interview on CNBC's “ETF Edge” this week.


However, the SEC will have two options, either an approval or a rejection, in its decision on May 23. But a rejection also ultimately means a postponement.
“Without any police on their heads, it forces investors to go on their own outside of the investment advisory community because the community can't help them because we don't know what the rules are,” Edelman said. And they find themselves involved in fraud and fraud.” said.






Edelman also criticized SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's refusal to write regulation, stating that it “actually hurts the consumer rather than helps.”
Meanwhile, Bitwise Asset Management's Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan is also defending the new rules. Hougan argued that “80-year-old securities laws do not fit neatly into this world of digital assets, crypto and 21st century technology.” Hougan believes that everyone wants a safe and secure platform where investors are protected and innovation is assured.


Bitwise has its own filing for a spot ethereum ETF, and Hougan remains hopeful that it will arrive. “We've entered the ETF era for crypto. We've seen Bitcoin ETFs come to market. We've seen the great things they've done for investors, lowering costs, improving regulations, increasing safety, security and peace of mind. I think we'll achieve that on Ethereum as well,” he concluded.

Blockchain's Disruptive Impact on Gaming - BeInCrypto


In our world today, blockchain technology is at the forefront of almost every innovation. A groundbreaking innovation itself, the blockchain was initially associated with cryptocurrencies but is rapidly disrupting other industries. 
From Finance and healthcare to supply chain management and even voting systems, we are experiencing the impact of blockchain technology at a seismic level. Its core tenets of transparency, security, and decentralization are proving—and continue—to be a potent recipe for change. Blockchain has empowered individuals and promoted new ways of interacting with the world around us. 
One of the industries that has been impacted the most by the influence of blockchain technology has been the gaming industry. This industry, with an estimated value exceeding $200 billion, is no stranger to disruption. From the rise of mobile gaming to the explosion of eSports, the gaming industry has constantly adapted to new technologies and other consumer preferences. 
Now, the concept of play-to-earn (P2E) is rapidly gaining traction. This gaming model offers players ownership of in-game assets and the potential to earn real-world rewards through gameplay.
According to DappRadar, in January 2024, the number of daily Unique Active Wallets (UAW) interacting with P2E games reached 1.5 billion. This was 28% of that month’s entire industry activity and highlighted the increasing user base in this space. This shift is attracting a new wave of users to the cryptocurrency world while reshaping the gaming and eSports scenery. In this article, we will dive into the disruptive impact of blockchain technology on gaming.
Rise of play-to-earn (P2E) 

The advent of P2E games has brought a fundamental change in the player experience. Traditionally, gamers dedicated their time and resources to virtual worlds, acquiring in-game items and characters with value within the confines of the gameplay. Blockchain technology has disrupted this model by introducing the concept of ownership. 
Players can now own unique digital assets within a game through NFTs. These assets are not exclusive to the game alone; they exist on a blockchain, which is a secure and transparent digital ledger that allows players to freely trade, sell, or rent them on secondary marketplaces. This creates a dynamic player-driven economy within the game, promoting a deeper connection and giving the players a true sense of ownership over their digital experiences. 
In 2022, the global P2E Games market was valued at $32.9 billion. This figure is projected to increase at a CAGR of 17.93% to $88.6 billion by 2028. Ownership, however, isn’t where the disruption stops. The P2E model incentivizes long-term engagement and rewards skilled players for their dedication. 

Imagine earning cryptocurrency or other valuable tokens through your gameplay, competing for real-world prizes, or accumulating tradable in-game resources. With P2E, players can potentially generate income through their passion for gaming, blurring the lines between entertainment and work.
The rise of P2E gaming is just the beginning. As blockchain technology continues to grow and integrate seamlessly into the gaming experience, even more innovative models will emerge. There are some already; Move-to-Earn (M2E), Watch2Earn (W2E) etc. This disruption is democratizing gaming, empowering players, and creating entirely new revenue streams within the industry. The future of gaming is being shaped by blockchain, and the possibilities are vast and exciting.
NFT-powered adventures in P2E gaming
According to Statista, the global Non-fungible token (NFT) market size was worth a staggering $41 billion in 2021—an amount that neared the total value of the entire global fine art market ($50 billion in 2020)—and is projected to experience continued exponential growth. 

NFTs are revolutionizing the concept of ownership. These unique digital tokens act as deeds of ownership for in-game assets, transforming them from part of the gaming build to valuable possessions. Imagine a virtual fantasy world where your spear isn’t only a digital weapon but also a one-of-a-kind NFT you can customize, upgrade, and even sell to other players on a secure marketplace. 
Rewards like these empower players to invest in virtual experiences, promoting deeper connections and a sense of true belonging within the gaming world.
The P2E model goes a step further. By integrating NFT mechanics with gaming, players can earn rewards for their achievements. This could involve anything from conquering challenging dungeons to fighting and slaying mythical beasts to participating in competitive tournaments and crafting rare items. 
These rewards, often in the form of cryptocurrencies or tradable tokens, can then be used to enhance their characters, purchase new in-game assets, or they can even be cashed out for real-world value. This creates a compelling economic dynamic, where players are not just passively consuming content but actively contributing to and profiting from the game’s ecosystem. 
NFT-powered P2E games like Sidus Heroes is a prime example of that trend. Sidus Heroes is a futuristic Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) that leverages the power of NFTs to create a truly player-driven economy. By using NFTs in the game, players can own in-game content which opens doors for trading, selling, or renting these possessions. This ultimately creates a vibrant marketplace fueled by blockchain technology. 

Democratizing eSports with blockchain technology
The impact of blockchain technology on gaming extends beyond NFTs. Companies like QORPO are using this technology to revolutionize the world of eSports. QORPO has positioned itself at the point where blockchain technology and eSports meet, aiming to make professional-level competition accessible to a wider audience. Their flagship project, Citizen Conflict, is a hero shooter game that combines fast-paced action with a robust eSports infrastructure powered by blockchain technology.

Here’s where things get more interesting. Traditionally, aspiring eSports stars face significant barriers to entry, often lacking the resources or connections to compete at the highest level. QORPO’s blockchain technology can change that. By creating a fair and transparent system, Citizen Conflict empowers talented players to showcase their skills and potentially earn rewards that could propel them onto the global eSports stage. 
This approach has the potential to disrupt an eSports industry that reached a worldwide audience size of 532 million people as of 2022 and is expected to reach over 640 million viewers worldwide by 2025. By leveraging blockchain, QORPO is paving the way for a new generation of eSports stars, and pushing for a more inclusive and meritocratic competitive scene. 
Bridging the gap between traditional and blockchain gaming 
P2E has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional and blockchain gaming experiences. Traditional gamers often value high-quality graphics, intuitive interfaces, and engaging storylines. Blockchain games, on the other hand, can sometimes prioritize complex mechanics or the underlying technology over user experience. 

New P2E projects are recognizing this need for accessibility. By focusing on user-friendly interfaces and captivating gameplay alongside the benefits of blockchain technology, they are creating a welcoming environment for both seasoned gamers and newcomers to the crypto space. 
Imagine an Open-World MMORPG that boasts stunning visuals and a rich narrative while simultaneously allowing players to own and trade unique in-game items through NFTs. This approach caters to the core desires of traditional gamers while introducing them to the exciting possibilities of P2E. 


In the last two sentences, I have just described Outlanders. Outlanders is an open-world MMORPG that bridges the gap between traditional and blockchain gaming. This project recognizes the importance of user experience, offering intuitive interfaces, engaging gameplay, and high-quality graphics that resonate with both seasoned gamers and newcomers to the world of cryptocurrency. 
This focus on user experience is crucial for the mainstream adoption of P2E gaming. By removing technical barriers and offering familiar gameplay mechanics alongside the benefits of blockchain technology, these innovative projects can attract a wider audience. This not only expands the player base for P2E games but also fosters a more diverse and vibrant gaming community. Ultimately, it will lead to a more robust and successful future for the entire P2E ecosystem. 
The future of gaming is P2E
The rise of these P2E games represents a glimpse into the future of gaming. Blockchain technology is not just about creating new experiences; it’s about empowering players, fostering community ownership, and creating a more equitable and rewarding gaming landscape. As the industry continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative P2E models emerge, transforming the way we play, compete, and potentially even earn a living in the virtual world.

Trader turns $3K into $46M in PEPE, Ethereum gas overhaul, Tornado dev guilty: Hodler’s Digest, May 12-18 - Cointelegraph Magazine


            
					
Top Stories This Week



Crypto trader turns $3K into $46M in one month as PEPE price soars



A savvy trader made $46 million in profit, which is an eye-watering 15,718-fold return on his initial $3,000 investment. The unknown wallet bought 4.9 trillion PEPE for $3,000 on April 15, which is currently worth over $56 million. The trader sold 1.41 trillion PEPE for $7.4 million and is currently sitting on 3.5 trillion PEPE, worth $38.9 million, according to a May 15 X post from Lookonchain. PEPE’s market capitalization was around $4.5 billion on May 15, making it the third-largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).



Vitalik Buterin proposes Ethereum gas model overhaul



Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed Ethereum improvement protocol, EIP-7706, which introduces a new gas model for transaction call data. This new fee would be separate from the existing gas fees for transaction execution and data storage. The proposal aims to reduce costs for transactions that are data-heavy but not computationally intensive by setting separate charges for call data, distinct from the costs of executing contract code or storing data in “blobs.” If the proposal is accepted, the Ethereum network will be responsible for setting the call data costs independently of other costs.



Tornado Cash developer guilty of money laundering



Alexey Pertsev, the developer of the cryptocurrency mixing protocol Tornado Cash, has been found guilty of money laundering, raising potentially severe implications for open-source code developers. The developer was sentenced to five years and four months in prison for allegedly laundering $1.2 billion worth of illicit assets on the platform. The sentencing came despite Tornado Cash being a noncustodial crypto mixing protocol — meaning that the funds that go through the protocol are never held or controlled by it.







Over 600 firms reveal billions in combined investment in Bitcoin ETFs



Over the past week, more than 600 firms have revealed significant investments in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in their 13F filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the data, professional investment firms reported owning $3.5 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs. Among them are Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, UBS, BNP Paribas, Royal Bank of Canada and hedge funds like Millennium Management and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, which is the largest BTC ETF investor with $1.9 billion invested.



Sam Altman thinks giving everyone ‘a slice of GPT’ could pay for UBI



Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI and chair of Tools For Humanity, has suggested a novel approach to universal basic income (UBI) by utilizing “compute” as a resource. In a recent episode of the All-In podcast, Altman discussed how the advancements in AI could reshape socioeconomics and possibly replace traditional monetary income with a system where everyone has access to computational resources. The executive suggested that individuals could use their allocated compute from powerful AI systems like GPT-7 for personal use, sell it, or donate it for purposes like cancer research.







Winners and Losers

Prediction of the week



Bitcoin moves toward range highs but derivatives traders watch from the sidelines



According to Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards, stock and crypto market seasonality, along with Bitcoin on-chain data, suggest that BTC price could consolidate for four-to-five months.



In a new report, Edwards said that Bitcoin continues to oscillate within the cycle range highs in the $58,000-65,000 region, with continuous weekly closes above the $58,000 “supportive of the long-term trend continuation.”



Likening BTC’s price action to gold, which formed a “massive cup and handle” pattern over the last 13 years, with the “cup” lasting four years, Edwards noted how Bitcoin appears to show the same chart pattern.



Edwards noted that given the similarities between Bitcoin and gold, there is a possibility that BTC could spend “up to 9 months in the range high forming a cup before a measured move up.” He said: 



“The technical picture remains bullish, provided the price holds above $58K. The longer we spend in the range highs, the more likely this structure will merge into a classic ‘cup and handle’ pattern, which would typically see strong price appreciation following.”







FUD of the Week



Filing suggests SEC is exploring grounds to deny spot Ether ETFs



Analysts have discovered a March filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicating that the regulator might consider classifying Ether as a security. Scott Johnsson, an associate at Davis Polk and Wardwell, analyzed a March 4 filing by BlackRock concerning its application to list a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Nasdaq. The filing extended the SEC’s decision deadline to June and requested public input on whether the ETF should be classified as a commodity. Johnsson suggested the ETF could be rejected if its filings should be classified as holding securities rather than commodity trust shares.

Microsoft faces multi-billion dollar fine in EU over Bing AI

Microsoft faces a fine in the European Union of up to 1% of its annual revenue if it doesn’t respond to a request for information by May 27. The threat stems from a request made under the E.U.’s Digital Services Act concerning the company’s Bing search engine and its associated generative artificial intelligence services. Source: @EU_Commission on X.com.A post on X.com compelling Microsoft to “provide information under the Digital Services Act on generative AI risks on Bing” was sent on May 17 disclosing the news to the public. “Bing may pose risks linked to generative AI, such as so-called ‘hallucinations’, deepfakes, as well as the automated manipulation of services that can mislead voters.”In a linked blog entry from the European Commission’s official website labelled “Daily News,” the Commission explained that the initial request was sent on May 14 “regarding specific risks stemming from Bing's generative AI features, notably “Copilot in Bing” and “Image Creator by Designer.”The blog post went on to explain that Microsoft “now has until 27 May to provide the requested information to the Commission.” This warning comes with a notice that the Commission “may impose fines up to 1% of the provider's total annual income” as well as “periodic penalties up to 5% of the provider's average daily income” if the E.U.’s request isn’t met by the deadline. While a 1% revenue fine might not sound like a crushing blow, in Microsoft’s case that could amount to well over two billion dollars. Its self-reported revenue for 2023 was $211 billion and, if the current market trend remains steady, it’s conceivable that Microsoft could blow past that in 2024. At these numbers, the least the Redmond company would pay, if fined, would be around $2.1 billion. It bears mention that these fines haven’t yet been levied and that, as of current, Microsoft hasn’t been found guilty of violating any E.U. laws — at least not specifically pertaining to this notice. Instead, this appears to be more of a public-facing courtesy notice that the company has effectively been serviced with a request for further information that bears consequences if ignored.Cointelegraph reached out to Microsoft for comment but didn’t receive an immediate response.

Fund managers predict SEC rejection of Ethereum ETFs next week - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            In contrast to the enthusiasm that preceded the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, reports over the past few weeks suggest that optimistic expectations for the Ethereum product’s approval have cooled down. Speaking with Bloomberg this week, Katherine Dowling, general counsel for ETF applicant Bitwise, said she anticipates rejection next week due to the lack of public activity typically seen before approval.“Most people are universally expecting a disapproval order,” Dowling noted. “You’re not seeing the types of public activities that you would see if there was going to be an approval.”In a CNBC interview, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck also predicted a likely denial. Next week, the SEC’s decision will confirm the fate of VanEck’s and Ark Invest’s filings.“We were the first to file as well for Ethereum in the US, and we and Cathy Wood, are kind of the first in line for May, I guess, to probably be rejected,” he stated.Unlike the frequent revisions made to spot Bitcoin ETF applications, there has been minimal back-and-forth between fund companies and the SEC regarding Ether ETFs. People involved in the talks with the securities agency reported that they had braced for a negative outcome.In the final month leading up to the spot Bitcoin ETF decision, the market buzzed with activity. Fund managers engaged in fierce fee competition, while industry experts placed bullish bets.Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have pegged the approval chances for spot Ethereum ETFs at a mere 25%. Seyffart recently expressed skepticism about a positive outcome, saying a nod is “not happening.”Why might the SEC decide to reject spot Ethereum ETFs?SEC Chair Gary Gensler has not been vocal about Ethereum ETF filings. However, he has clarified that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs does not set a precedent for other crypto ETFs. Concerns about the classification of most cryptos as securities remain a major obstacle to compliance.According to Scott Johnsson, Van Buren Capital’s general partner, the SEC must provide a clear and detailed explanation if they reject spot Ethereum ETF filings. One potential reason for rejection could be Ethereum’s classification.The SEC has not definitively classified Ether, and its decision might hinge on whether it considers Ether a security. If the SEC views Ether as a security, then spot ETFs wouldn’t be allowed under current regulations.The SEC’s alleged investigations into the Ethereum Foundation and the implications of Ethereum’s staking feature suggest a possible regulatory direction.The SEC might not approve all spot Ethereum ETF applications at once: CoinbaseDespite the uncertainty, Coinbase’s analyst David Han sees a 30% to 40% chance of approval by month’s end.He believes the correlation between CME futures and spot exchange rates, which was pivotal for Bitcoin ETF approvals, could similarly benefit Ethereum ETFs.However, like Johnsson, Han noted that the SEC might focus on Ethereum’s PoS mechanism as a reason for denial since regulations around staking are unclear. He suggested spot Ethereum ETFs enabling staking are unlikely to be approved.ARK Invest and 21Shares recently amended their S-1 form for the proposed spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by removing the staking component. The move is considered an effort to align the filing with SEC preferences.

Ripple Reports Surge in XRP Trading And XRPL Network Activity


Ripple has released its first-quarter report for this year, highlighting substantial network activity for its XRP token and the XRP Ledger (XRPL).
These growth metrics coincide with substantial progress in Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
XRP And XRPL Wins Big in the First Quarter

XRP’s daily spot trading activities surged 40% to approximately $865 million during the reporting period. The firm noted that XRP volume across exchanges remained fairly constant, with Binance, Bybit, and Upbit responsible for over 70% of the total traded volume.
Crypto traders’ speculative interest in XRP remained high in the first quarter, hitting a daily average of $500 million. Ripple stated that the high spot and open interest volume highly correlated with general market activity, pointing towards robust XRP trading and activity across venues.
Furthermore, transactions on XRPL doubled in Q1 2024 from the previous quarter. The number of transactions soared from around 121 million in Q4 2023 to over 251 million by the end of Q1 2024. Notably, this transaction surge coincided with a significant decrease in average transaction fees, which fell about 45% to $0.000856 by the end of March.

“Average transaction fee reached a high in December due to widespread testing of inscriptions on the XRPL. As such, the decrease in average cost per transaction indicated a reset and that no network congestion occurred in the quarter,” Ripple explained.

Moreover, XRPL underwent significant technical upgrades in the first quarter. During the period, XLS-30—a non-custodial automated market maker (AMM)—was introduced to enhance on-chain liquidity and trading capabilities for DeFi developers and users.


“More XRPL traction – I’m particularly excited that the native AMM, arguably one of the largest updates to the XRP Ledger, went live in Q1,” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said.

Furthermore, XRPL integrated with other platforms like Axelar. This integration expanded XRPL’s capabilities, allowing developers to easily interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications across over 55 blockchains.

Despite this ecosystem growth, Ripple’s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC continues afoot. Notably, the case is nearing its conclusion, with the SEC seeking a $2 billion fine against Ripple. Ripple has countered this request, deeming it baseless and advocating for a penalty not exceeding $10 million.

“In terms of next steps, both parties will wait for the Judge to make a determination on the final remedies – likely in the coming months. Ripple remains confident that the Judge will approach the remedies phase fairly,” Ripple concluded.

$384,000,000 To Be Handed To 191,000 Victims of Banking Giant's Illegal Practices: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - The Daily Hodl


								A US banking regulator says $384 million will soon be handed to victims of an online bank’s illegal practices.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says 191,000 people will receive the windfall of cash, which will be given to former customers of Texas-based Think Finance.










The agency filed a lawsuit against the lender in 2017, accusing the company of tricking customers into repaying loans they did not owe.
The firm’s loans in 17 states were considered illegal, void and uncollectable.
Now, the CFPB says it’s beginning to distribute $384 million from its victims relief fund to support people who got caught in the scam.
Says CFPB Director Rohit Chopra,
“Too often, victims of financial crimes are left without recourse even when the companies that harm them are stopped by law enforcement. 
The victims relief fund allows the CFPB to help consumers even when bad actors have squandered their ill-gotten profits.”
The agency began making payments to people harmed by Think Finance’s practices on May 14th.
Anyone who believes they are eligible can find out more here.
The CFPB says it’s handed out approximately $19 billion to consumers harmed by scams, frauds, and other illegal practices since 2010.

Are New Altcoins Listing On Exchanges Like Binance Profitable? This Crypto Researcher Has The Answer | Bitcoinist.com


								A crypto and macro researcher identified as “Flow” on X (formerly Twitter) has provided a detailed review of the profitability of new altcoins listed on Centralized Exchanges (CEX) such as Binance. The researcher disclosed that prominent exchanges like Binance have experienced a significant decline in the value and performance of new tokens listed on their platform. 
80% New Listed Altcoins On Binance Are Down
Reports from Flow suggest that new tokens listed on CEXs’ are not as profitable as they once were. Highlighting all the listed tokens on Binance from the past six months, the crypto researcher noted that 80% of these new altcoins have declined massively, with their value falling below their initial listing price. 

Most of these tokens were listed on Binance from November 2023 to May 2024. New tokens like BLUR, which was integrated on November 24, 2023, plummeted considerably, recording a 45.6% decrease in performance. 
Source: X
On the other hand, excluding two altcoins, all tokens listed from the beginning of 2024 have declined. The most significant drop was recorded by a token called PORTAL, which decreased 69.2% from its listing date on February 20, 2024. 
Only four cryptocurrencies recorded significant gains from the 32 newly listed tokens on Binance. Meme coins like Ordinals (ORDI) and Dogwifhat (WIF) experienced the largest gains, 261.9%,i and 117.69%, respectively. At the same time, others like Jito (JTO) and Jupiter (JUP) saw gains above 50%. 
Flow has disclosed that if investors had diversified their portfolios by investing equal amounts in each of Binance’s newly listed tokens, they would have suffered a significant 18% decline over the past six months. 
The macro researcher noted that when tokens launch at an elevated Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV), they tend to depreciate, ultimately underperforming. He disclosed that most of the tokens listed on Binance are backed by Tier1 VC and launched at extremely high prices, resulting in substantial profit taking and a significant decline. 
New Tokens Have No Real Users
According to Flow, new altcoins launching on Binance are no longer profitable investment vehicles, as their high FDV at launch removes most of their upside potential. He indicated that these newly listed altcoins currently serve as exit liquidity for insiders, who exploit retail investors‘ limited access to quality investment opportunities.

Additionally, the crypto researcher disclosed that newly listed crypto projects on Binance have no real users or a strong community backing them. Their tendency to launch at high FDV also leads to unsustainable growth, which discredits the broader crypto industry. 
Flow asserted that investing in newly listed tokens was a rigged game, highlighting a comment made by economist Alex Kruger, who stated:
Most tokens launching these days are engineered to pump and inevitably dump. This happens because founders set very short vesting schedules, fake metrics, and focus on hype rather than on user acquisition.
Kruger also revealed that automated trading bots and market makers disadvantage ordinary investors by buying large amounts of tokens at launch prices and selling them at significantly higher prices.

Altcoin Tied to Security-Focused Crypto Wallet Surges by 43% This Week Amid Rollout of New Swaps Feature - The Daily Hodl


								An altcoin linked to a security-focused crypto wallet is outperforming the broader digital asset market, surging by more than 40% this week.
Safe is a smart contract wallet that runs on multiple blockchains.










The project introduced native swaps this week.
Explains Safe,
“Batch auctions consolidate multiple transactions, reducing gas costs and the need for multiple signatures. A smoother, more efficient trading process is here. 
Built-in MEV (maximal extractable value) protection by specialized third-party solvers ensures fair and interference-free transactions. Specialized solvers compete to fill orders by accessing a broad network of decentralized liquidity sources, aiming for more competitive pricing.”
SAFE, the project’s native asset, managed to soar by as much as 43% this week after rallying from a seven-day low of $1.78 to a high of $2.55. SAFE has retraced since and is trading at $2.21 at time of writing.
Despite its recent gains, the altcoin remains more than 37% down from its all-time high of $3.56, which it set on April 23rd of this year, according to CoinGecko.
SAFE began trading in April. That month, Coinbase listed the asset with an “experimental label,” which the exchange attaches to tokens that pose certain risks such as price swings and canceled orders because of lower trading volume and availability.
The Singapore-based cryptocurrency trading platform Bitrue and the Seychelles-based exchange MEXC also listed Safe for trading starting April 25th.

Assessing the Solana ecosystem and how Jito will help it grow - AMBCrypto



Jito collected large amounts of daily fees, surpassing a vast majority of DeFi protocols.
The Solana ecosystem continued to see growth as activity on the network soared.

Solana [SOL] has been able to attract numerous users to its ecosystem over the last few months. Primarily, this growth in activity has been initiated by memecoins being attracted to the network.
Jito shows growth
However, other elements of the Solana ecosystem have also seen growth over the last few days. One of them was the Jito protocol.
At press time, Jito was generating $1.5 million in daily fees, surpassing all but a few DeFi protocols. For comparison, Lido collected $2.58 million and Uniswap collected $2.09 million in fees over the past 24 hours.
Jito’s success has several potential implications for Solana. Firstly, it demonstrates the growing DeFi landscape on Solana.
Jito’s ability to compete with established DeFi giants like Uniswap and Lido showcases Solana’s ecosystem’s potential to create highly competitive dApps.
This could attract more developers and users to the platform, further accelerating DeFi growth within the Solana ecosystem.
Secondly, Jito’s high fees indicate a healthy level of network activity on Solana. This activity could translate to increased network security and potentially higher value for SOL in the near future.
However, a large part of Jito’s fees are derived from MEV (maximum extractable value), which can sometimes lead to negative user experiences like sandwich attacks.
Solana will need to find ways to mitigate these potential drawbacks to ensure sustainable growth. Overall, Jito’s performance is a positive sign for Solana.
Source: X
In terms of overall activity on the Solana network, there was a massive uptick observed. The number of daily transactions occurring on the network grew from 17 million to 28 million over the last week.
Coupled with that, the number of daily active addresses on the network grew from 1 million to 1.5 million during the same period.
Source: Artemis
State of SOL
At press time, SOL was trading at $174.67 and its price had grown by 3.80%  in the last 24 hours.

The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) had surged significantly during the same period, indicating that the money flowing into SOL had surged.
However, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) had reached into the overbought territory, which could suggest a correction could be on SOL’s way in the future.

Bitcoin Ready to Break $70,000? Experts Debate Current Bull Run - DailyCoin


        
The Bitcoin price has unexpectedly climbed above $67,000 for the first time in a month.



Sentiment has reached its most bullish level since January. This major shift has coincided with the recent surge.



The fear of missing out (FOMO) has the potential to threaten the sustainability of the current rally.
Bitcoin has been on a thrill-seeker’s adventure in 2024. We soared to record highs in March, only to sputter and stall in the weeks since. The April halving event, hyped as a potential price rocket launch, fizzled instead. But hold onto your mining rigs, because Bitcoin might be pulling a surprise U-turn.Price Surge Ignites OptimismOver the past week, Bitcoin defied expectations by breaching the $67,000 mark for the first time in nearly a month. Even more intriguing? This isn’t just a blip on the radar. This price surge seems to be triggering a seismic shift in how people feel about the cryptocurrency.
Imagine a giant online mood ring for Bitcoin. That’s essentially what Santiment, an on-chain analytics firm, offers. Their “Weighted Sentiment” metric tracks the overall sentiment, positive or negative, surrounding Bitcoin. It factors in two key ingredients: the chatter (social volume) and the general vibes (sentiment score). When social media explodes with Bitcoin discussions and the overall tone is rosy, the Weighted Sentiment jumps through the roof and according to Santiment, Bitcoin’s sentiment just hit its most bullish level since January, fueled by this recent price surge. This surge in optimism rivals the euphoria that followed the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s green light for Bitcoin spot ETFs, a major vote of confidence for the cryptocurrency’s legitimacy.Don’t Let FOMO Fool YouThe good vibes aren’t just a Bitcoin lovefest. Santiment’s data reveals that Chainlink (LINK), another major cryptocurrency, is also experiencing its most bullish sentiment in over a year, coinciding with a near 20% price increase last week. This has analysts debating whether this could be the start of the second leg of the bull run.
A bullish market is generally a cause for celebration. But there’s a dark side: FOMO, the fear of missing out. When everyone seems to be striking gold in crypto, it’s easy to get swept up in the frenzy and make rash decisions. Santiment emphasizes that keeping FOMO “under control” is crucial for a sustained Bitcoin price rally and a potential push towards the highly anticipated $70,000 mark.Predicting the future of Bitcoin is like trying to predict the weather, notoriously tricky. But one thing’s for sure: the recent price surge and the shift in sentiment paint an intriguing picture for the future of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. On the Flipside
Bitcoin’s price is still highly volatile. This surge could be temporary and could be followed by another correction.



The recent rise in Bitcoin’s price also coincides with a general upswing in traditional markets. A downturn in the stock market could dampen Bitcoin’s momentum.



Bullish sentiment can be a contrarian indicator. When everyone is optimistic, it might be a sign the market is nearing a top.
Why This MattersBeyond Bitcoin’s individual price action, this surge coincides with a massive increase in positive sentiment across the market, mirroring the pre-ETF euphoria. This combined momentum could signal a broader bull run for cryptocurrencies, but cautious optimism is key to avoid impulsive investment decisions fueled by FOMO.This article explores Bitcoin ETFs attracting inflows, discussing Bitcoin surging over 7% and spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessing their second-largest inflows of the month:Bitcoin Bull is Back: Why BTC’s 7% Jump Is Just the BeginningIf you’re interested in the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price, this article about Bitcoin ETFs might be of interest:Bitcoin ETFs See $303M Inflows as BTC Soars North of $65K

Genesis wins court nod to return $3 billion to creditors - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Bankrupt crypto lending company Genesis Global Holdco received court permission to return approximately $3 billion in cash and crypto assets to its creditors as part of its bankruptcy liquidation process on Friday. US Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane made the decision.In addition, Judge Sean Lane rejected Digital Currency Group’s (DCG), attempt to challenge the distribution plan for the debtors’ assets in the bankruptcy case.DCG objected to the distribution plan as it believes repayments should be capped at the crypto asset values of January 2023 (at the time of Genesis’ bankruptcy filing). Since then, the value of cryptos like Bitcoin has surged, with Bitcoin’s price jumping from around $21,000 to a current value of nearly $67,000.The firm also claimed that the plan provides too much return to creditors at DCG’s expense. Essentially, DCG feels that it is unfairly disadvantaged by how the returns are allocated.However, DCG’s arguments failed. Judge Sean Lane ruled that, as an equity holder, DCG’s financial interest isn’t directly impacted by how the assets are distributed. Equity holders only get paid after all creditors are satisfied.Additionally, given the insolvency and the massive creditor claims, DCG won’t receive any distribution under this plan.The total amount owed to creditors is billions of dollars higher than the debtors’ available assets. These claims have priority over equity holders like DCG, meaning they get paid first in line during bankruptcy.The ruling also considered the substantial $32 billion in claims from federal and state financial regulators, prioritizing them over DCG’s equity stake.Genesis had previously estimated that it could pay up to 77% of the value of customer claims, a figure subject to future market fluctuations. Hit hard by the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX, Genesis – along with other lending platforms – faced liquidity issues during the 2022 market downturn. This ultimately led the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2023.Genesis’ creditors include several prominent names, such as Gemini, Bybit’s Mirama, Decentraland, and VanEck.Adding to its troubles, Genesis Global Capital faced a legal lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC accused Genesis and Gemini of selling unregistered securities through Gemini Earn. The company reached a $21 million settlement with the SEC in March this year.

Shiba Inu Metrics Turn Bullish: Here’s How Many Wallets Stand Between Current Price And $0.000139 | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu is exhibiting interesting price action as it looks to break above a downward-sloping upper trendline under which it has been trading since the first week of March. Currently, SHIB is up by 10% in the past seven days and is at a decisive junction of a breakout that could lead to a strong bullish action. Failure to exhibit a strong breakout could lead to a reversal into bearish action. 
However, although SHIB is looking prime for a breakout, data shows there are still multiple resistance levels to overcome. Particularly, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock (ITB) reveals multiple walls of addresses between the current price and $0.000139.
Shiba Inu Looking To Break Above $0.0001
At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002494. Recent price action in the past 24 hours indicates that the bulls are now looking to push the cryptocurrency above the $0.000025 price level. This indicates that many investors are still bullish on SHIB.

According to data from ITB, around 62,700 addresses purchased 69.97 trillion SHIB at this point at an average price of $0.000025. Although SHIB will eventually break through, there are still five resistance walls to overcome on its way to reaching a new all-time high. These price walls consist of a range of addresses that could initiate selloffs immediately after breaking even.
Interestingly, there are around 454,160 addresses holding over between the current price of Shiba Inu and the current all-time high of $0.00008845. The first major resistance is at an average price of $0.000028, where 98,230 addresses are holding around 40.17 trillion SHIB tokens. This range of addresses bought in at a maximum price of $0.00003 and SHIB would need to break above this price point before the next resistance.
After surpassing this maximum price, Shiba Inu would be facing another resistance at around $0.000033 where 143,280 addresses are holding 21.3 trillion SHIB tokens. Shiba Inu would need to breach an additional barrier at an average price of $0.000040. There are only 57,180 addresses waiting here with a maximum and minimum price of $0.000036 and $0.000044 respectively.

However, this level represents a major psychological barrier as SHIB has yet to perform a strong break above $0.000040 this year. A rally up to this point could lead to a consolidation in the short term as many traders sell and take profits. At the same time, it could also lead to an increase in accumulation which in turn could translate to a stronger bullish sentiment.
The path to $0.000139 includes two other resistance levels with 62,340 and 92,530 addresses holding volumes of 33 trillion SHIB and 29.73 trillion SHIB respectively. 
On the flip side, Shiba Inu would need to defend its current support at $0.000022 in the short term.

Stalin on Solana (STALSOL) to Skyrocket 13,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Stalin on Solana (STALSOL) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Stalin on Solana (STALSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because STALSOL has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Stalin on Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Stalin on Solana could become the next viral memecoin.



Stalin on Solana launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Stalin on Solana on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Stalin on Solana by entering its contract address – gJisVCA2QNsRa4j3ur1h3uzyXW5VuMQYHmQ2dQ1k4tE – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like STALSOL.

Court Clears Genesis’ $3B Bankruptcy Plan Despite DCG Objection - DailyCoin


        

The bankruptcy court has finally approved Genesis’ Chapter 11 plan.



Judge Sean Lane dismissed DCG’s objections against the bankruptcy plan.



Per the plan, users affected by the collapse will receive reimbursements soon.




The Gemini Earn nightmare appears to be nearing its end after bankrupt crypto lender Genesis secured court approval for its Chapter 11 plan on Friday, despite objections from its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DGG). 



After over a year of users’ assets stuck in limbo, the approval looks to propel them closer to full recovery as soon as next month. 



Genesis Secures Major Win



On Friday, May 17, US Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane did not heed the slew of objections against Genesis when approving its Chapter 11 plan, which seeks to return over $3 billion in cash and assets to creditors this year. 




The development marks a significant milestone for Genesis and Gemini Earn users, who have been waiting for reimbursement for over a year following the chaos stirred by the collapse of Terra Luna and Three Arrows Capital. 



While DCG particularly opposed the proposal, Judge Lane did not hesitate to dismiss complaints against Genesis’ Chapter 11 plan.



Court Dismisses DCG’s Objections Against Genesis



DCG, Genesis’ parent company, did not approve of the new Chapter 11 plan. It argued that claims should have been valued in US dollars at the time of the company’s bankruptcy filing in January 2023, bypassing the crypto industry’s gains over the past year and a half.




However, Judge Lane shut down DCG’s objections, claiming that the parent company had “no economic stake” in the case. He also wrote, “The record here clearly establishes that there is not sufficient value in the Debtors’ estates to provide DCG a recovery as equity holder after unsecured creditors are paid.” 



Judge Lane further highlighted that Genesis’ approved plan involves a multi-step process to allocate assets based on whether users were owed US dollars or cryptocurrency. He pointed out that, due to the rise in digital asset prices since the resolution was reached, creditors with claims in crypto would bear some “shortfall.” 



“Due to the increase in the price of digital assets after a resolution was reached, it is currently anticipated that those creditors whose claims are denominated in U.S. dollars will be receiving 100% of their loan balance (deferring payment of post-petition interest) while creditors with claims in cryptocurrency will bear the shortfall in funds,” Judge Lane wrote. 



Now, despite DCG’s objections, Genesis can proceed with reimbursing its patient customers. 



Gemini Earn Claimants to Receive Reimbursement Soon



Following the news, Winklevoss twin-led exchange Gemini celebrated the Chapter 11 plan approval, calling it a “welcome decision.” The platform, however, did note that the ruling did not impact global settlement among Gemini, Genesis, and other creditors in the Genesis Bankruptcy previously approved by the Bankruptcy Court.



As per the approval, Gemini Earn creditors will receive their owed assets at the beginning of June. Gemini announced that approximately 97% of owed funds will be repaid initially, with payments made as in-kind reimbursements. This means that a customer who deposited one bitcoin into Gemini Earn will receive one bitcoin back rather than the US dollar value of the token at a specific date.



The approach starkly contrasts FTX’s bankruptcy plan, which values users’ claims when the exchange filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. 



On the Flipside




Genesis is slated to pay the SEC a $21 million fine from remaining bankruptcy funds to resolve the regulator’s lawsuit.



Genesis recently agreed to a settlement deal with the NY AG office. 




Why This Matters



The bankruptcy plan approval is a major win for users affected by Genesis’ collapse. It presents them with a concrete and strategic roadmap outlining the timeline for recovering their funds.

X To Unleash The Dogecoin Flood? Payments Promise Stirs Community


								The Dogecoin army is barking with excitement after an insider hinted at the long-awaited integration of Dogecoin (DOGE) into X Payments, Elon Musk’s social media platform. However, a closer look reveals a reality check is needed before Doge rockets to the moon.

Dogecoin Disciples Rejoice At Insider’s Tweet
A spark ignited the Doge community when “DogeDesigner,” an insider with both X and Dogecoin connections, tweeted about a potential late-2024 launch of X Payments with DOGE support. This unleashed a wave of enthusiasm, with both crypto enthusiasts and regular users eager to see the meme coin take center stage on the popular platform.


But Musk Remains Silent: Will Doge See The Light Of X?
The rumors of a Doge-X marriage have circulated before. Similar murmurs have inspired the crypto community—especially those sporting Doge avatars—to respond time and time again with unwavering optimism.
But Musk, the X-wielding, Doge-loving ruler, has been remarkably silent. He hasn’t specifically rejected DOGE’s inclusion, but it’s still difficult to get an official confirmation from him.
Total crypto market cap currently at $2.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView
The lack of confirmation doesn’t dampen the Doge army’s spirits. Their unwavering optimism is fueled by X Corporation’s recent acquisition of licenses allowing them to process cryptocurrency payments in specific US states. This intriguing move has the crypto world abuzz with speculation, with many interpreting it as a potential first step towards embracing DOGE for payments.
A Reality Check Is Needed
Despite the excitement, a dose of reality is necessary. First, Musk has repeatedly and emphatically stated that neither X nor any of his ventures plan to create their own cryptocurrencies. This stance was a direct response to scams targeting unsuspecting investors and rumors of a future “X coin.” The ongoing scrutiny by the US Securities and Exchange Commission on altcoins likely plays a role in this decision.

Second, even with X Payments accepting cryptocurrencies, there’s no guarantee DOGE will be the chosen one. Several established cryptocurrencies with larger market caps and wider adoption might be more attractive options for X.

The Doge Army’s Undying Hope
These obstacles don’t seem to bother the Doge army, which is renowned for its unshakable allegiance. They cling to the hope that DOGE will be accepted as payment on X due to Musk’s previous affection for the joke coin. If their persistent optimism pays off, or if their hopes of a Doge-powered X come crashing down, remains to be seen.
Will X Payments become the launchpad for Dogecoin’s next moonshot, or will it be another case of Doge dreams deferred? The answer lies with Musk, and with the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation.

Flipped Cat (FLICAT) to Surge 8,300% Before Bitrue, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Flipped Cat (FLICAT) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Flipped Cat (FLICAT), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Flipped Cat presents a similar opportunity.



Flipped Cat has a market cap below $17,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,300% in the coming two days ahead of it being listed on giant crypto exchange Bitrue, and Flipped Cat could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap.




Currently, Flipped Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Flipped Cat on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Flipped Cat by entering its contract address – JDCyeohyUFrxX31t4tY8Fe5LzMWkstAMaVHuH8Lq71Z1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like FLICAT.

Shiba Inu's Q2 price prediction: Will SHIB retest $0.000030? - AMBCrypto



SHIB could be set to build on its recent increase, technical analysis revealed.
The difference in exchange flow suggested sideways movement before the price bursts upward.

Shiba Inu [SHIB] posted an 11.69% increase in the last seven days. However, the token has been struggling to maintain that momentum over the last two days.
Irrespective of that, some technical indicators suggest that the price could get back to its rally. One of the signals AMBCrypto observed was the golden cross on the 4-hour SHIB/USD chart.
To get a golden cross, traders look at the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This pattern forms when the shorter EMA crosses above the longer EMA.
Shiba Inu flashes a bullish sign
At press time, the 20 EMA (blue) had crossed over the 50 EMA (yellow)—A golden cross, indicating a bullish trend.
Furthermore, SHIB’s price had not slipped below the 50 EMA, meaning the thesis has not been invalidated.
However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) was down to 30.21. This decrease indicates that a lot of capital has flowed out of the SHIB market. In a bearish situation, this could lead the price to $0.000022.
However, the MFI might likely hit the oversold point, which could be around 20.00 or below. Should this be the case, the price of the Shiba Inu native token might rebound.
Sustaining the golden cross if (when) this happens could take the price higher.
Source: TradingView
The likely first stop could be $0.000027, after which, SHIB’s value could rise to $0.000030, which was close to the ceiling it hit in March.
For this, considering the technical aspect alone might be enough. Hence, AMBCrypto took things from the state of the token on-chain.
Consolidation before breakout
In doing this, we assessed the exchange inflow and outflow. If the exchange inflow is higher than the outflow, it means that the token involved could face selling pressure, and the value could drop.
On the other hand, a higher exchange outflow favors a price increase. As of this writing, SHIB’s exchange outflow was 53.20 billion. The inflow, at the opposite end, was 50.55 billion.
Historically, the 3 billion difference between the metrics might not be enough to support a one-directional movement. As such, SHIB’s price might consolidate in the short term.
Source: Santiment
From our outlook, the price might move between $0.000023 and $0.000025. Going forward, traders might need to keep an eye on the netflow.
In a case where the outflow doubles the exchange inflow, then we might see SHIB’s price move upward slowly. If sustained, a breakout to $0.00030 could be achieved.

Read Shiba Inu’s [SHIB] Price Prediction 2024-2025

A summary of the analysis suggested that this rise could come to pass before the end of May.
However, there is a likelihood that this prediction could be invalidated. Thus, traders might need to watch for changes in the status of Shiba Inu on-chain, and from the technical perspective.

Horoscope crypto from May 20th to 26th

New week, new crypto horoscope dedicated to the upcoming week from May 20th to 26th.
This week will be characterized by four transits:
The Sun enters Gemini from Monday 20/5;
Full Moon in Sagittarius on Thursday 23/5;
Venus enters Gemini on Thursday 23/5;
Jupiter enters Gemini from Saturday 25/5.
For several months now we have been dedicating space to the crypto horoscope written by Stefania Stimolo, an expert in astrology and blockchain. It is a weekly column with the horoscope of each zodiac sign available every Sunday only on The Cryptonomist. 
In our slogan “We Tell the Future”, we wanted to delve deeper into the topic, jokingly speaking, with this entertainment column. 

The crypto horoscope
We call it crypto horoscope simply because industry terminology is used. 
Words like NFT, metaverse, and Over-The-Counter to describe actions and scenarios, but also trading terminology like bullish, bull run, bear market, or dump to identify the mood of each zodiac sign during the days of the week.
Obviously, the famous to-the-moon cannot be missing to indicate the mood of that sign! 
In general, you could experience a period of “hard-fork”, intended as an “inner split”, or pass your lightning torch to the next zodiac sign, meaning that the Sun is moving to the next sign. 
Or, simply, you need to reflect on some situations that go into “verify“, that is when the planet is in dissonance with the zodiac sign. Not only that, with each new change of guard of the Sun through the constellations of the zodiac, the roadmap of each sign will touch a new step. 
Obviously no investment advice is given, in fact, it is pure entertainment, just like any other horoscope. It must be said that there are many beginners in the sector who have understood the specific crypto terminology also thanks to the horoscope on The Cryptonomist. 
“Don’t Trust, Verify”
Astrology is not an exact science, but it aims to predict the future in its own way. So why not associate the typical phrase of blockchain “Don’t Trust, Verify” here as well. 
And in fact, what the author wants to propose is her interpretation of the planetary transits that occur during the week, describing the reaction of each zodiac sign, following the “logic” of traditional astrology. 
For those who are astrology lovers, they could stay updated just by following the weekly transits that are communicated and somehow influence us. Whether it’s a Mercury Retrograde or the days of the Full Moon. 
Others, on the other hand, may access the dedicated page, which is updated every Sunday, and read the horoscope of their zodiac sign, their rising sign, or why not, even the horoscope of friends and loved ones. 
And so, just for entertainment purposes, don’t waste time and click here to read your horoscope for this week!

Pump.fun Attacker Was Arrested By UK Law Enforcement And Is Now Out On Bail - Coincu



	

Key Points:




London authorities detain pump.fun attacker, possibly identified as Jarett Reginald Dunn.



Exploit on pump.fun platform compromises $1.9 million worth of SOL coins through redirected funds and flashloan manipulation.



pump.fun relaunches with $45 million in affected liquidity, offering 0% trading fees for 7 days to rebuild confidence.




British law enforcement in London detained an individual suspected to be behind the pump.fun attack, revealed in a post by user @therollupco on X.





Pump.fun Attacker Was Arrested In London



The alleged pump.fun attacker, known as @STACCoverflow, was later released on bail and could potentially be identified as Jarett Reginald Dunn.



The attack targeted pump.fun, a popular platform for launching meme coins on Solana, resulting in the compromise of the protocol and the theft of approximately $1.9 million worth of SOL coins. Exploiting bonding curve contracts, the pump.fun attacker redirected funds intended for the Solana decentralized exchange Raydium to unrelated wallet addresses, according to insights from on-chain analysts.



Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at Wintermute, assessed the situation, indicating a possible compromise of a key, although the prospect of insider involvement remains under scrutiny. The exploit utilized flashloans, borrowed and repaid within a single blockchain block, facilitated by MarginFi’s services.




Pump.fun Rebuilds Trust After Crypto Crisis



Notably, a former pump.fun employee claimed responsibility on X shortly after the attack, boasting about their actions and acknowledging the risk of imprisonment.



Following the incident, pump.fun has relaunched, with the affected liquidity totaling around $45 million. The team has reintroduced the contract, resumed trading, and announced a 0% trading fee for the next seven days. Despite the setback, pump.fun is striving to restore trust and stability to its platform.

Kraken USDT Support Now Continues Amid Legal Challenges In Europe - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Kraken denies plans to delist Tether (USDT), maintaining support despite regulatory uncertainties.



The exchange is prepared to comply with the EU’s MiCA regulations, but Kraken USDT support will continue.



Kraken acquires TradeStation Crypto and plans a European headquarters in France or Ireland.




Kraken, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has officially denied any plans to delist Tether (USDT) in Europe despite increasing regulatory uncertainties.





Kraken USDT Support Guaranteed in Europe



The announcement of Kraken USDT support comes as the cryptocurrency world faces growing concerns about the reliability and compliance of stablecoins like Tether.



The European Union’s approval of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework has prompted exchanges to reassess their strategies to ensure compliance. Kraken’s Global Head of Regulatory Strategy, Marcus Hughes, emphasized that the exchange is prepared to meet emerging regulatory needs but clarified that there are currently no plans to delist Tether or modify its USDT trading pairs in Europe.



Hughes reiterated the Kraken’s commitment to supporting Tether and its related trading pairs, stating that the exchange has no intention of withdrawing Kraken USDT support at this time. This reassurance contrasts with earlier reports suggesting Kraken might cease support for Tether due to regulatory pressures.




Kraken Expands with New Acquisitions and Headquarters



The exchange’s stance is significant as it impacts investor sentiment and market dynamics within the crypto ecosystem. Regulatory scrutiny of stablecoins like USDT has intensified, and Kraken’s position provides some stability amidst the uncertainty.



Kraken is also expanding its regulatory footprint by acquiring TradeStation Crypto and finalizing plans for its European headquarters, which are likely to be located in either France or Ireland. This move aims to bolster its regulatory compliance and better serve its European clients.



Kraken’s decision to continue supporting Tether in Europe reflects its strategic approach to navigating regulatory landscapes while maintaining liquidity and service quality for its European users.

Bitcoin Has Completed Profit-Taking Phase Amid Backdrop of Rising Capital Flows to BTC, Says Analyst Willy Woo - The Daily Hodl


								Popular on-chain analyst Willy Woo believes Bitcoin (BTC) is now in a position to kick start a fresh leg up after months of consolidation.
Woo tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that he’s looking at Bitcoin’s spent output profit ratio (SOPR), which tracks whether coins are being sold at a profit or loss.










According to Woo, the metric currently shows that BTC holders are done taking profits close to record highs, suggesting that sell pressure is losing momentum.
“Profit-taking has completed, it took two months. A very healthy reset, against a backdrop of capital flows into the network climbing again.”

The on-chain analyst also shares a chart suggesting that capital inflows into BTC are starting to pick up.

Looking at the bigger picture, Woo believes that Bitcoin is gearing up to ignite the next leg of its bull market.
“Here’s the bigger picture of where Bitcoin is in its liquidity cycle… it’s still doing warm-up exercises.
It’s consolidating under all-time highs, during this time, long time frame risk signal is quite low. Risk only starts climbing after the floodgates open.”

Based on the analyst’s chart, he seems to suggest that Bitcoin appears to be mirroring the bull market setups of 2017 and 2020 when BTC was consolidating close to record highs before a steep upside rally.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $67,097.

Massive Cryptocurrency Whale Has Made Huge Losses on These Two Altcoins: Makes New Move - Bitcoin Sistemi


An interesting activity was observed in the movements of a whale in the onchain data examined by cryptocurrency analysts.
The cryptocurrency whale detected by Lookonchain seems to have recently purchased a large amount of memecoin. Data shows that the whale trading on the Solana network purchased $1.85 million worth of dogwifhat (WIF) and $281,000 worth of POPCAT.


The whale, which had previously traded, bought WIF worth $2.18 million at $2.98 and POPCAT worth $361 thousand at $0.5 3 days ago.
At the time of writing this article, WIF price is traded at $ 2.54, while POPCAT is around $ 0.37.





In other words, the data shows that the whale in question has actually suffered significant damage.

With the two memecoins experiencing a significant decline, the whale lost 336 thousand dollars in WIF token and 80 thousand dollars in POPCAT.


While WIF is traded on Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, POPCAT is an altcoin with a relatively lower market value and is traded only on some smaller cryptocurrency exchanges.

BTC ETFs: Grayscale GBTC inflows near $1B in 1 week, analyst says... - AMBCrypto



Institutional interest in Bitcoin grows, adding liquidity despite Grayscale’s recent high-fee withdrawals.
Retail investors accumulate Bitcoin, enhancing decentralization, while whales show less interest.

Bitcoin [BTC], the leading cryptocurrency, is beginning to recover from a week-long slump, currently valued at $67,093 with a 1.28% increase in the past 24 hours.
Additionally, on the 17th of May, Farside Investors reported that Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) saw inflows of $31.6 million, and GBTC now oversaw more than $18 billion in assets.

Well, Grayscale has faced major challenges since converting from a trust to a spot ETF in January. However, three consecutive days of inflows have been a boon for GBTC.
What are the execs saying?  
Seeing a positive outlook of GBTC among investors, an X (formerly Twitter) user, @osf_rekt said,

This transition has resulted in over $17 billion in withdrawals, largely due to higher fees than other options.
Additionally, a series of bankruptcies within the crypto industry over the last two years compelled companies to withdraw funds to meet creditor obligations.
Interestingly, on the 15th of May, all spot Bitcoin ETFs, apart from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), reported inflows.
Simultaneously, on a similar day, Grayscale’s GBTC notably recorded its first inflows in a week, drawing in $27 million.
This highlights that institutional investors are showing interest in Bitcoin, bringing liquidity, while crypto whales remain less enthusiastic.
Increased in retail investors 
Data from Santiment, analyzed by AMBCrypto, indicate that while whales slowed accumulation, retail investors are increasing, promoting network decentralization.

This trend of retail accumulation could benefit Bitcoin in the long run by promoting greater network decentralization.
Highlighting May’s positivity for spot Bitcoin ETFs, Eric Balchunas, Senior Analyst at Bloomberg, noted,
“The bitcoin ETFs have put together a solid two weeks with $1.3b in inflows, which offsets the entirety of the negative flows in April- putting them back around high water mark of +$12.3b net since launch. This key number IMO bc it nets out inflows and outflows (which are normal).”

Offering advice to investors, he further commented,
“Last two mos show why best not to get emotional over flows which come in and out, part of ETF life, but a) i think they’ll net out positive long-term b) the flow amts on either side are small relative to aum maybe (1-2%) so it’s never SO OVER or SO BACK if you think about it.”

Prominent Analyst Sees Dogecoin Poised for Explosive Growth | Cryptoglobe


                                
Kaleo, widely known in the cryptocurrency community as Crypto Kaleo, is a prominent trader and analyst with a substantial following on social media, particularly Twitter. He is well-regarded for his market analysis, trading strategies, and insights on a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and altcoins.



On 17 May 2024, Kaleo expressed his anticipation for an imminent surge in Dogecoin (DOGE) on the social media platform X, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is poised for significant upward movement. In a later clarification to a follower, Kaleo explained that while his short-term predictions for Dogecoin usually indicate a move higher, there is also a possibility of a short-term dip before an eventual rise. He emphasized the importance of continuing to accumulate Dogecoin regardless of short-term fluctuations.



On the same day, Kaleo elaborated on his bullish stance towards Dogecoin, drawing parallels between the recent meme stock mania involving companies like GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) and the behavior of retail investors. He observed that the resurgence in meme stocks demonstrates that retail traders and investors are once again embracing risk. This risk-on mentality has been evident in the cryptocurrency market over the past year, particularly with the explosion of various memecoins (such as Pepe and Dogwifhat).







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Kaleo highlighted Dogecoin’s enduring status as the leading memecoin, noting its deep-rooted familiarity among retail investors and the cryptocurrency community. He pointed out that Dogecoin was the original meme that inspired belief in the potential of a community-driven cryptocurrency movement. Despite market fluctuations, he asserted that Dogecoin is far from obsolete.



Kaleo argued that as soon as Dogecoin begins to attract more buying interest, it is likely to experience a sharp vertical movement. He noted that the cryptocurrency community is currently saturated with numerous options, while retail investors are eager for the kind of excitement they recently experienced with meme stocks like GME and AMC. Kaleo believes it is only a matter of time before Dogecoin gains momentum again and emphasized his determination not to miss out on the opportunity when it happens.



At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at around $0.1547, flat on the day. Its $22.3 billion market cap makes it the 10th most valuable cryptoasset. In the year-to-date period, DOGE is up 71.22%.

Ripple CEO “Particularly Excited” About Native AMMs


Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouset recently commented on the company's most recent quarterly report, highlighting the automated Market Maker (AMMs) feature that was activated in Q1. Garlinghouse has stressed that this is "one of the largest updates" on the XRPL.  A significant milestone As reported by U.Today, the AMM feature, which makes it possible to replace traditional order books with liquidity pools, went live in late March to much fanfare. Ripple's David Schwartz claimed that the rollout of the feature had marked "a significant moment" for the XRPL. With that being said, the AMM launch was plagued by some technical hiccups. The feature's intended functionality was hindered by a critical bug. The vulnerability was later fixed by developers. The AMM functionality was then integrated into the mainnet of the XRP Ledger in early April. In future quarterly reports, Ripple will be including AMM volume in the DEX volume. Other key highlights Apart from the AMM feature, Ripple also highlighted other key developments in its most recent quarterly report. These key developments include Ripple's ongoing legal fight with the SEC over the size of fines and penalties, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs as well as global regulatory developments. Ripple has also provided an update on the state of XRP markets, noting that volatility levels remained "elevated."

Bitcoin Bull Brandt Burns Schiff: "Stop Betting on Dead Horses!"


								The world of finance is no stranger to colorful characters, and this week, the gloves came off between two titans with opposing views on Bitcoin: Peter Brandt, a crypto bull, and Peter Schiff, a Bitcoin skeptic.
Their battleground? Social media, of course.

Schiff Touts Silver’s Shine, Brandt Calls It Something Else
Schiff, a long-time gold advocate, recently set his sights on silver. He pointed to the metal’s recent price surge of over 20% compared to BTC’s more modest 2% gain, declaring:

“That’s more than 10x the bang for your buck with silver. Bitcoin is dead. Long live silver!”

Brandt, ever the Bitcoin champion, wasn’t having it. He countered that Schiff’s pronouncements were simply a ploy for attention, mockingly suggesting Schiff was having a “social media orgasm” just because silver “decided to take a jog.”


This exchange is the latest chapter in a long-running feud between the two financial figures, with Schiff consistently making bearish predictions about the top coin that haven’t come to pass.
Is Bitcoin A Hedge Against Inflation?
The debate around Bitcoin’s future extends beyond social media spats. With inflation concerns on the rise, some see Bitcoin as a potential hedge. However, recent outflows from BTC ETFs cast a shadow on this theory.
BTCUSD now trading at $67.153. Chart: TradingView
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust both experienced negative flows, totaling over $230 million in just over a week. This suggests that some investors are losing faith in the crypto asset’s ability to weather economic storms.
Schiff Doubles Down On Transaction Speed Concerns
Despite the inflation debate, Schiff remains unconvinced. A recent live debate saw him reiterate his belief that the digital currency’s slow transaction speeds and high fees render it impractical as a daily-use currency.
He stated:

“Bitcoin is a slow and expensive way to transfer value. It’s not a currency.”


Fodder For Social Media
While Brandt dismisses Schiff’s comments as self-serving noise, the debate around the crypto’s future is far from over. Investors are grappling with questions of inflation, practicality, and long-term viability.
As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, the ongoing battle between Bitcoin bulls and bears is poised to remain a prominent feature on social media and beyond.

Former FTX Executive Pleads For an 18-Month Maximum Sentence - Coin Edition


							

Ryan Salame’s lawyers have asked for a lenient sentence for their client.
The lawyers begged the court to sentence Salame to not more than 18 months in prison.
Salame served as the CEO of the Bahamian portion of FTX.




Following a guilty plea from last September, lawyers for former FTX executive Ryan Salame have asked for a lenient sentence for their client. In a recent filing, Salame’s representatives asked the court to sentence the accused to not more than 18 months in prison, noting that a lenient sentence would satisfy the purpose of sentencing while allowing him to continue contributing positively toward society.









In support of their plea, Salame’s lawyers highlighted that their client did not play a central role in FTX’s fraudulent activities. Instead, they argued that he lost most of his fortune with the collapse after the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy in 2022.



The lawyers highlighted Salame’s contributions to the community as part of their plea bargain. According to them, those who know the accused regard him as “an outstanding member of the community.” The lawyers further noted that people around would testify that Salame is known for “contributing significantly and making a positive impact in the world.”



During his time at FTX, Salame served as the CEO of the Bahamian portion of the company and worked closely with Sam-Bankman-Fried. He pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business and one count of conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions and defraud the Federal Election Commission. 







Salame is the only one among Bankman-Fried’s four associates who did not have a cooperation agreement during last September’s trial. However, he pleaded guilty like the others but asked the court to consider his consider his alcohol and drug-related issues ahead of sentencing.



The accused could spend up to 10 years in jail based on the magnitude of his offense. Before now, he had agreed to forfeit $1.5 billion in addition to making a restitution of $5.6 million to FTX debtors. Salame has also agreed to pay $6 million to the U.S. government and forfeit property in the Berkshires and a 2021 Porsche 911.

Why Altcoins Are The Best Investment For Now - Analyst


																Popular crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe continues to back altcoins to put up a spectacular bullish performance in the coming months. In a new X post on Saturday, the veteran analyst takes a deeper dive explaining the reasons behind his advocacy for altcoins investment ahead of a highly expected crypto bull run.


	Related Reading



Investing In Altcoins Is The Best, Analyst Says Why
In his most recent bullish prediction on altcoins, van de Poppe begins by stating these tokens may not present as the most ideal investment especially considering that their combined value is down by 70% against Bitcoin in the last three months. 
The analyst has attributed this poor performance to several factors including a delay in network updates and an extended bear market. In addition, van de Poppe also notes Ethereum’s current struggles to be a significant contributor to this market downturn. 
He explains that typically the crypto bullish hype moves from Bitcoin to Ethereum, followed by tokens with big market cap, then middle-cap tokens and small-cap tokens. 
However, this cycle appears to be experiencing some delay due to a bearish cloud over Ethereum, driven by uncertainty over the approval of a proposed spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) as well as its asset class. 
Nevertheless, van de Poppe believes this delay to be quite temporary as he postulates that market traders are currently pricing in any potential negative effect from the denial of an Ethereum Spot ETF or the classification of the prominent altcoin as a security. 
Once Ethereum embarks on a bullish course, van de Poppe predicts other altcoins to follow suit. The analyst projects that certain tokens could record a 1000% gain as seen between October 2023-February 2024, amid the hype around Bitcoin spot ETFs.
However, the analyst nudges investors to buy into the altcoin market now during the period of “lowest confidence”. He believes such an act is similar to investing in Bitcoin at $3,700 at the start of 2020, thus ensuring investors generate maximum profits in the coming bull run.


	Related Reading



Ethereum ETF Approval In The Balance
As weeks continue to progress, the approval of an Ethereum spot ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears highly uncertain. 
This sentiment is driven by the Commission’s ongoing deliberation on whether to classify Ethereum as a security as well as a lack of dialogue between the agency and prospective issuers.  The next deadline dates are for May 23/May 24, during which the SEC will respond to 2 ETF applications with many analysts expecting further delays from the Commission.
At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at around $3,123.39 reflecting a 0.53% increase in the last day.

                        The crypto market has experienced a significant surge in fundraising, reaching a whopping $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2024, fueled by a shift in market sentiment and fresh inflows.According to a recent analysis by PitchBook, a leading data provider for private and public market investors, there has been a substantial increase in investment activity within the cryptocurrency sector compared to the previous quarter.The bull market witnessed during Q1 played a pivotal role in driving the surge in investments.Cryptocurrency values soared to levels not seen in months, enticing institutional investors to pour money into the market following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).VC Funds Participate in Bull Market
Venture capital funds actively participated in this bullish run.According to the PitchBook report, a total of 518 deals amounting to $2.3 billion were closed in the first quarter of the year within the cryptocurrency industry.This reflects a remarkable 40.3% increase in investments compared to the previous quarter.Considering the heightened on-chain activities observed in Q4 2023, this surge marks a substantial leap forward for the sector.Deal volume or the number of transactions also saw a notable rise of 44.7% in the preceding quarter.As asset values increased, market valuations soared throughout the year, setting the stage for a promising investment climate.The experts at PitchBook anticipate continued growth in investment activity throughout the remainder of the year.Noteworthy examples of successful fundraising within the cryptocurrency market include Zama, a crypto firm specializing in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), which secured $73 million in funding.EigenLayer, another industry player, received $100 million in Series B funding.However, the most significant deal of the quarter was Together AI, which raised $106 million, propelling its valuation to an impressive $1.1 billion.As more institutions venture into the cryptocurrency sector, a multitude of deals are driving increased valuations for various companies.VC Funding Surpasses $1 Billion for Second Consecutive Month
For the second month in a row, crypto venture capital funding has exceeded the $1 billion mark, highlighting continued investor interest in the industry.As reported, April witnessed $1.02 billion in funding spread across 161 investment rounds, slightly down from March’s $1.09 billion across 186 rounds.Nonetheless, this marks the first time since October-November 2022 that the crypto sector has seen two consecutive months of funding surpassing $1 billion.Earlier this year, Balance, a digital asset custodian based in Canada,  revealed that it has once again achieved $2 billion in assets under custody (AUC) amid the recent recovery in crypto markets. Likewise, Korea Digital Asset (KODA), the largest institutional crypto custody service in South Korea, has seen a remarkable growth in crypto assets under its custody.Just recently, the company revealed that the value of these crypto assets under its custody expanded by nearly 248% in the second half of 2023.

Ripple’s Q1 2024 Report: XRP Ledger’s Groundbreaking Innovations and Soaring Activity | Cryptoglobe


                                
Ripple’s recently published “Q1 2024 XRP Markets Report” offers an in-depth look at the remarkable advancements and developments within the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The report details several key innovations and integrations that position XRPL for substantial growth and enhanced functionality, showcasing Ripple’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology.



XLS-30 Goes Live



A significant milestone for XRPL this quarter was the activation of XLS-30 on the Mainnet, following a community vote. This update introduced a non-custodial automated market maker (AMM) as a native feature to XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX). Designed to provide on-chain liquidity and trading capabilities, this AMM aggregates order books and liquidity pools at the protocol layer, facilitating optimal price execution for DeFi developers and users.



Shortly after its launch, community developers and the RippleX team promptly addressed a bug affecting the AMM functionality. The bug fix was thoroughly tested and successfully integrated into the Mainnet by 11 April, ensuring robust performance moving forward.



XRPL Integrations



XRPL’s integration capabilities received a significant boost with several key partnerships this quarter. Axelar’s integration expands XRPL’s interoperability across over 55 blockchains, enabling developers to execute smart contract calls and deploy decentralized applications cross-chain. Zoniqx also announced plans to streamline the tokenization process for real-world assets on the XRPL, while Orchestra Finance successfully launched on the Mainnet.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Additionally, EasyA rolled out educational modules and initiatives aimed at onboarding its community of over 750,000 developers to the XRPL and its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible sidechain. This initiative is set to simplify the development of decentralized applications on the XRPL, leveraging its high-speed, low-cost infrastructure.



On-Chain Activity



The report highlights a remarkable 108% increase in on-chain transactions last quarter, alongside a 45% decrease in the average cost per transaction. Despite a spike in transaction fees in December due to widespread testing of inscriptions, the subsequent decrease indicates a reset and confirms that no network congestion occurred during the quarter. Ripple says future reports will include AMM volume in the overall DEX volume metrics, reflecting the growing impact of this new feature.



Auto-Bridging Enhancements



According to Ripple, a standout feature of XRPL’s DEX is auto-bridging, which utilizes XRP as the native currency to facilitate trades between any two assets on the ledger. This feature leverages XRP’s counterparty-free nature to find the most efficient trading routes, enhancing liquidity and trading efficiency. The recent integration of the AMM function complements auto-bridging by generating compatible trading offers, thereby expanding liquidity access and trading options.



Ripple believes that as XRPL continues to add assets and applications, the synergy between AMMs and auto-bridging will play a crucial role in enhancing ecosystem functionality and interoperability. This integrated approach is set to drive XRPL’s evolution as a premier blockchain platform.

These Are This Week's Best-Performing Altcoins as Bitcoin (BTC) Calms at $67K (Weekend Watch)


																Bitcoin had a quite positive trading week in which it gained over six grand and skyrocketed to its highest price tag in almost a month of over $67,000.
Most altcoins also followed suit, with SOL, AVAX, BCH, LINK, and many others registering double-digit gains.
BTC Calms at $67K
Bitcoin had retraced to just over $60,000 last Friday, but the bulls managed to defend that psychological support level during the weekend. Moreover, the asset started to climb on Monday and jumped to just over $63,000. It failed there and retraced to $61,200 on Tuesday, ahead of the US CPI announcement for April, but shot up once those numbers came out.
More precisely, the cryptocurrency gained several grand and skyrocketed to over $66,500 for the first time since mid-April. Another brief retracement followed, but the bulls went on the attack once again in the past couple of days.
This time, they pushed the largest digital asset to almost $67,500. Despite retracing slightly since then, BTC still trades around $67,000 now. Its market capitalization remains at $1.320 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at 51.7% on CG.

SOL Leads the Way
Since the past 24 hours have been quite dull in terms of price movements in the crypto space, we will focus on the weekly scale in which SOL and LINK have stolen the show. The former has soared by 17.5% and trades at a multi-week high of over $170, while LINK is up by 22% and stands close to $16.5.
Next on the weekly top gainers’ list are Avalanche (14%), Bitcoin Cash (13%), UNI (13%), IMX (10%), GRT (12%), NEAR (9%), and ICP (10%).
In contrast, TON has declined the most from the larger-cap alts, having lost over 9% of value in the past seven days. BNB and TRX are also slightly in the red.
The total crypto market cap is up to $2.550 trillion on CG, which means that it has gained over $150 billion on a weekly scale.

Crypto Startups Raise $2.4B in 2024 Q1; EigenLayer Raises $100M Coin Edition


							

PitchBook reveals 2024 Q1’s substantial increase in crypto fundraising, with startups accumulating $2.4 billion.
Ethereum’s EigenLayer has raised $100 million in a Series B funding round.
Together AI secures the largest deal of the quarter, raising a $106.0 million early-stage round.




According to the latest insights from market data aggregator PitchBook, the first quarter of 2024 has seen a substantial surge in crypto fundraising. The report unveiled that Ethereum’s restaking platform, EigenLayer, has led the charge, raising $100 million in Series B funding round.





PitchBook revealed that the $2.4 billion fund accumulated by startups across 518 deals marks a 40.3% increase from the previous quarter. In addition, the platform pointed out that the figure represents “a 44.7% increase in deal volume compared with the last quarter.”



The report further spotted the significant achievement of Together AI, “developer of an open-source, decentralized cloud platform for large foundation models.” As per the report, Together AI secured the largest deal of the quarter, raising a $106.0 million early-stage round “led by Salesforce Ventures at a $1.1 billion pre-money valuation.” The round follows a $102.5 million Series A at a pre-money valuation of $463.5 million in the last quarter.









Shedding light on the segment’s fast growth, PitchBook asserted that investment rounds became “highly competitive.” Highlighting the high spirit of investment rounds, especially at the early stages, the platform added, “Early-stage deals are earning higher valuations than late-stage deals, but the sample set is relatively small, so we will see if this trend holds in the coming quarters.”



Adding more insights into the matter, PitchBoook elaborated on the median pre-money valuations for all stages. While in the pre-seed/ seed stage, the valuation marked $21.8 million, it was a staggering $72 million in the early stage. In the late stage, the valuation went down to $51.1 million. These valuations were substantially up from 2023, “representing YoY increases of 85.5%, 148.3%, and 7.6%, respectively.”

The SocialFi sector challenges Meme Coins in the crypto market

The crypto world is constantly evolving and, while meme coins have seen explosive growth, a new trend is quickly emerging: SocialFi platforms. 
These platforms are capturing the market’s attention and, in some cases, are even surpassing meme coins in terms of influence. Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallet, provides a detailed overview of the unique relationship between SocialFi and meme tokens, highlighting the key similarities and differences between these two phenomena.

Crypto world: Similarities in distribution strategy between SocialFi and meme coins
The SocialFi platforms use token distribution strategies similar to meme coins. For example, DEGEN tokens are not subject to pre-mining and 15% of the total supply is allocated to ecosystem development over a four-year period.
The rest is distributed through airdrops and liquidity incentives, common practices also in the distributions of meme coins. This fair and community-oriented distribution is a characteristic that both categories share.
Functional applications of SocialFi platforms
A distinctive aspect of SocialFi platforms is their ability to offer more functional applications compared to meme coins.
A significant example is the friend.tech token, which not only introduces unique applications but also engaging elements like ‘Clubs’.
These elements increase the level of engagement and challenges for users, creating a more interactive and dynamic experience. 
However, this complexity could also narrow the audience, limiting the appeal of SocialFi platforms compared to meme coins, which are often simpler and more accessible.
Bitget Wallet and meme coins: the crypto trend before SocialFi tokens
Bitget Wallet has cleverly leveraged the trends of meme coins, introducing new features and activities that support transactions with these cryptocurrencies. The company has indeed integrated the most popular blockchains, integrated support for new meme coins into the ecosystem, and improved swap transaction capabilities. 
Furthermore, the launch of their own meme coin – MOEW – and the organization of various meme-themed activities, have led Bitget Wallet to be considered a leader in the meme coin sector.
The evolution of the market and the role of DEX
Alvin Kan observes that the growth of decentralized exchanges (DEX) has provided a solid foundation for trading meme coins. 
Kan says:
“The industry has shifted from being focused on capital to being community-oriented, marking a significant transition”.
This year, in fact, the cryptocurrency market has been looking for the big narrative to follow after the era of Bitcoin ETFs. Meme coins have therefore proven to be a successful candidate.
Conclusion
SocialFi platforms represent a new frontier in the world of cryptocurrencies, challenging meme coins in terms of influence and market interest. With similar distribution strategies but more functional and engaging applications, SocialFi platforms offer an interesting alternative that could redefine the cryptocurrency landscape.

Bitcoin hasn't rallied much after the 'halving.' Is $100,000 next?

One month after Bitcoin’s big halving event, people in the crypto community want to know where the major cryptocurrency is heading.Nvidia stock has all-time closing high in its crosshairsThe latest Bitcoin halving — a technical event that cuts the reward for mining new Bitcoin by half — occurred on April 19-20, which divided the reward from 6.25 Bitcoin to 3.125. Bitcoin’s halving, a feature to ensure the cryptocurrency’s scarcity and safeguard it from inflation, happens every four years.Right now, Bitcoin’s value is hovering around $65,000 — and it’s primarily in the green because inflation has eased and the stock market is bullish.  Bitcoin didn’t jump significantly after the halving process and currently hovers roughly 12% below its record high of $73,803 set in March; it’s still up about 140% in the past year. But historically, Bitcoin has jumped after the halving event.The first Bitcoin halving happened in November 2012, when the reward for mining a block was reduced from 50 Bitcoin to 25. At that time, Bitcoin’s price was $12. It went up to $44 in 100 days and then $135 in 300 days. The second halving event occurred in July 2016, when the reward was reduced from 25 Bitcoin to 12.5. The flagship cryptocurrency went from $658 to $1,551 in 300 days. At the third halving in May 2020,  the Bitcoin incentive was reduced by half to 6.25 Bitcoin. At that time, Bitcoin was at $8,601, moving upward to $50,941 within 300 days.Steven Lubka, a managing director at Bitcoin financial services company Swan Bitcoin, seems optimistic about the growth of the top cryptocurrency. In an email, he wrote that Bitcoin’s performance has a massive run-up ahead of the halving, which historically has not happened. “Bitcoin has never really seen a sharp rise post-halving; it generally occurs on a month-by-month basis as time progresses,” he said.Rennick Palley, founding partner at the crypto venture capital firm Stratos, adds that in the next 12 months following the halving, Bitcoin will probably continue its upward price movement.So why is this year’s halving different from its predecessors? It’s primarily because Bitcoin reached its peak a month prior, making it difficult to maintain the same momentum. Plus, experts add, the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs have changed the factors that affect the price movement of the top cryptocurrency.According to Palley, the price of Bitcoin is now largely determined by global liquidity dynamics and adoption. “As fiat money continues to be printed and as more people around the world recognize the value of Bitcoin as a store of value, the price of Bitcoin in dollar terms will continue to rise,” he said.Many will continue to be surprised by Bitcoin’s changes in dynamics, but the analysts say they won’t be surprised if the flagship cryptocurrency crosses the $100,000 mark this year. “It’s always difficult to forecast an exact timeframe, but I expect six-figure Bitcoin on the horizon,” Lubka said.CoinGecko, a crypto tracking website, finds that Bitcoin’s price has increased by 96,302% since 2013.

Bitcoin Pizza Day celebrates the time a man spent $650 million on pizza

Illustration: Maksim Zakharau (Getty Images)On January 3, 2009, Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, mined the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, known as the Genesis Block, which contained a reward of 50 Bitcoin. The technical foundations of Bitcoin were being established at the time, but the currency did not have any real-world value.That changed on May 22, 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida-based programmer, offered 10,000 bitcoins to anyone who would order him two pizzas from Papa John’s.Hanyecz wrote on the Bitcoin Talk forum: “I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!”He further added what toppings he likes: “I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.”“If you’re interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.”

Trump's Crypto Embrace: From "Disaster" to "I'm Good With It" ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Former U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a positive outlook toward cryptocurrencies, marking a potential shift in his stance on digital assets.



Notably, Trump’s affirmation came in response to inquiries about his position on crypto during a recent public appearance. In a statement, he declared, “I’m good with it,” signaling a willingness to embrace the burgeoning industry.



Further, in response to inquiries about crypto during his appearance, Trump acknowledged the exodus of crypto businesses from the US due to regulatory hostility. He emphasized the importance of addressing these challenges, stating, “If we’re going to embrace it, we have to let them be here.“



The presidential candidate also criticized the Biden administration for erecting high barriers to the crypto industry through stringent regulations enforced under the watch of SEC’s Gary Gensler.



“Biden doesn’t even know what (crypto) is…The democrats are very much against it and I say this…a lot of people are very much for it and I’m fine with it, I want to make sure it’s good and solid,” added Trump.

&nbsp



That said, Trump’s affirmation has stirred discussions within the cryptocurrency community. Trump’s stance could have significant implications for the future of digital assets in the United States should he clinch the presidency in the upcoming elections.



In a Thursday tweet, Messari Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto analytics firm, praised Trump for his stance on crypto-generated attention.



However, not everyone is convinced about Trump’s stance. Some see it as a political gimmick to garner support from younger generations, who are the biggest players in the sector.



“The devil is in the detail. He hated #Bitcoin last time he was in power. Now he wants the “crypto” vote? Will US policy towards BTC get worse or better under Trump?” wrote Simon Dixon, founder of crypto investment firm Bank of the Future.



Notably, this is not the first time Trump has shown his support for crypto despite his apparent hostility to the sector in the past. In addition to launching several highly profitable NFT projects in the past, in early March, Donald Trump presented a more neutral viewpoint on crypto, particularly during an interview with CNBC.



“I have seen there has been a lot of use of that, and I’m not sure that I’d want to take it away at this point … I can live with it one way or the other,” Trump stated when asked about his stand on Bitcoin.



Notably, this is reversed from his comments in 2021, where he had said that crypto is a “disaster waiting to happen.”

Solana Ranked The World’s Fastest Blockchain, Outshining Ethereum, Polygon ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
‘Ethereum killer’ Solana has taken the blockchain ecosystem by storm after becoming the fastest blockchain in the world with record transaction speed. Research from CoinGecko shows that the network processed an astounding 95 million transactions in a single day. This achievement is not just a technological feat but also marks a huge milestone in the blockchain and crypto industry. 



Solana Takes The Speed Crown



Solana has emerged as the cheetah of the cryptosphere thanks to its lightning-fast speed.



According to a recent research report by crypto data aggregator CoinGecko, Solana leads with the highest daily average transactions per second (TPS), clocking in at 1,053 TPS. This remarkable achievement in speed solidifies Solana’s status as a so-called “Ethereum killer,” which has long been questioned due to the constant network outages.



Sui comes in second at 854 TPS, followed by Binance Smart Chain (BSC) at 378 TPS, Polygon at 190 TPS, TON at 175 TPS, Tron at 159 TPS, Near at 117 TPS, and Avalanche at 89 TPS.



Meanwhile, established networks like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have long struggled with transaction speed limitations. Ethereum recorded an average peak TPS of 22.8, while the world’s largest blockchain, Bitcoin, processed just 10.7 transactions per second.

&nbsp



CoinGecko analyzed the processing speed of the top 30 blockchains based on their total value locked (TVL) ranking on DefiLlama as of May 15, 2024, to ascertain the fastest blockchains. Processing speed was calculated using the actual or realized TPS metric, measured as a daily average, to ensure a uniform comparison across multiple blockchains.



Solana’s peak performance was awe-inspiring, attaining 1,504 TPS on April 6, 2023, owing to an upsurge in meme coin transactions. This performance makes Solana approximately 46 times faster than Ethereum and 5 times faster than Polygon — the fastest among Ethereum scaling solutions.



CoinGecko’s study noted that despite ranking as the fastest blockchain, Solana has only achieved 1.6% of its theoretical maximum TPS of 65,000.







Solana’s exceptional speed has not gone unnoticed in the cryptocurrency market. At press time, SOL changed hands for $173, representing a 2.7% gain on the day and an 18.2% increase on the weekly chart. This performance underscores the market’s confidence in Solana’s potential to revolutionize the digital transaction landscape.



Is Solana Truly An “Ethereum Killer?”



Solana started its mainnet operations in March 2020, with a claimed throughput of 50,000 transactions per second (TPS). The network sought to improve Ethereum’s scalability inefficiencies.



Unlike Ethereum, which relies on layer-2 scaling solutions to enhance scalability, Solana offers scalable solutions for a decentralized ecosystem. But Solana’s technique has been widely criticized following its previous repeated outages. In early April, soaring demand for meme coins caused roughly 76% of Solana transactions to fail.



Prior to that, block production on Solana halted for around five hours before developers and validators could build and test a release that contained remediation.

Crypto Analyst Envisions Record Bitcoin Gains Before October Amid Global Liquidity Shift ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp
Popular crypto analyst Willy Woo predicted that Bitcoin will likely experience a bullish breakout in October of this year. He predicted this even as the index posted a strong showing, rising above $67k. Some analysts were quick to predict an immediate bullish outlook for the premier digital currency, but Willy had none.



He tweeted:







In addition to predicting the resumption of the long-term bull market before October, Woo also claimed that 2025 would be a record year for Bitcoin. He focused on global liquidity statistics to make the projections.



Price Action



Bitcoin was largely sluggish for most of this month. However, the largest digital currency by market capitalization shed some value a few days before press time, followed by a half-hearted recovery. Here is how BTC performed earlier today on Bitstamp:







Time to Jump on the Bullish Bandwagon?



Several analysts, including Willy’s colleagues on X, were quick to jump on the bullish bandwagon and declare the resumption of the bull market.

&nbsp



Woo is known for his analytical approach and is a Bitcoin maximalist.



This small rally coincided with relatively positive US Labor statistics, so it could just be an anticipation of the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates.



Has the Bull Market been Revived?



According to crypto billionaire Mike Novogratz, Bitcoin is likely to fluctuate between $55k and $75k for the time being until another favorable external indicator presents itself. The furor around the Bitcoin block reward halving, aka Bitcoin halving, and the spot ETF approval has died down.



While the trading range suggested by Novogratz is quite broad, it provides a sound basis for the future. Any mediocre move between $60k-$70k will not revive the long-term bull market, that is for sure. The upward forces need to move above the new all-time high of $73k to change their fortunes.

Big Debate Between Analyst Saying "Bitcoin is Dead" and a 50 Years of Economist - Bitcoin Sistemi


Peter Schiff and Peter Brandt, two analysts who frequently share analyzes about the cryptocurrency market, got into a serious discussion.
The discussion first started after gold-loving analyst Peter Schiff commented on the performance of some assets recently. Citing a previous tweet, Schiff mentioned that the price of silver has increased by 21% since the beginning of April. In addition, he said that the increase in value of Bitcoin during the same period was only 2%.


Schiff claimed that people can make 10 times more profit with silver compared to Bitcoin. He claimed that Bitcoin was dead.

In response, Peter Brandt, a trader in the market for nearly 50 years, stepped in. Brandt, who is also known for his pro-Bitcoin statements, told his followers that they should completely ignore tweets like Schiff's.





In addition, he argued that Schiff aims to gain followers and attention by saying “nonsense” like this. However, he said Schiff “is not as stupid as those in his speech.” The analyst added that although Schiff's prediction about silver, one of his many predictions, came true, his predictions have generally come true so far.

Venezuela bans crypto mining to protect power grid

The Venezuelan government has joined the list of countries that have frowned on crypto mining due to its hefty electricity demands.According to a local news outlet, Venezuela’s Ministry of Electric Power (MPPPE) has unveiled plans to disconnect cryptocurrency mining farms from the national grid. The move aims to regulate excessive energy consumption and guarantee a stable power supply for the population.An X post from Venezuela’s National Association of Cryptocurrencies stated that crypto mining is prohibited throughout Venezuela. The move prioritizes energy stability over the burgeoning crypto-mining industry.This move follows a recent crackdown that involved confiscating 2,000 cryptocurrency mining devices in Maracay, Aragua state, about 120 kilometers southwest of Caracas, as part of an anti-corruption initiative. Source: Asociación Nacional de CriptomonedasThe Ministry emphasized the need to offer efficient and reliable electrical service across Venezuela by eliminating the strain caused by these high-energy-consuming farms. According to officials, these measures are essential to stabilize the national power supply, which has been unreliable for the past decade.The country has experienced recurring blackouts, particularly since 2019, significantly impacting residents’ daily lives and the overall economic performance.Cryptocurrency mining is infamous worldwide for its hefty electricity demands. In response, countries such as China and Kazakhstan have implemented stringent regulations or outright prohibitions on the practice to safeguard their power infrastructure and prioritize energy allocation to vital public services.The government’s move against cryptocurrency mining is reportedly part of a larger anti-corruption push, leading to several top officials’ arrests. Joselit Ramírez, the ex-head of the National Superintendency of Cryptoassets (Sunacrip), is a key figure in these corruption allegations. Related: GoMining CEO bullish on Bitcoin: “The mining business remains profitable”Rafael Lacava, Governor of Carabobo state, has reportedly emphasized the importance of public collaboration in detecting illegal mining operations. He encouraged citizens to come forward and report any unlawful activities, stressing the vital role that community involvement plays in protecting the reliability of their electricity supply.However, this is not Venezuela’s first act against crypto mining activities. In March 2023, Venezuela’s energy supplier shut down crypto mining facilities nationwide to reorganize the national crypto department and corruption investigations involving the country’s oil company.Venezuela’s attorney general, Tarek William Saab, disclosed that government officials were allegedly running parallel oil operations with the assistance of the national crypto department.Last year, eight major cryptocurrency mining operators in Kazakhstan signed an open letter to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, complaining about the high energy prices for miners.

Archeologists Use AI to Interpret Historical Data Related to Trade Routes and Financial Systems | Cryptopolitan

Archeologists at Stanford and Duke interpreted historical data related to financial systems with the help of AI by speeding up data analysis, simulations, and visualizations.This technological revolution not only reduces time and resources but also uncovers things that cannot be discovered by traditional methods alone. By studying data from different places, AI can construct trade routes and economic links between continents.Also Read: Can AI in Archaeology Unlock the Mysteries of Ancient History?“AI is revolutionizing archaeology by enabling data analysis, simulations and visualizations at scales and speed not previously possible and by providing endless variants and processing that can multiply the human capacity to understand and rethink the past.”
Maurizio Forte, a professor at Duke UniversityScientists at Stanford Uncover Historical Trade Network Using AIResearchers at Stanford University applied AI to the assessment of the dispersion of amphorae, a kind of vessel used for transporting commodities such as wine and olive oil. The AI model uncovered the detailed trade networks that linked different regions of the empire and thus showed how complex and far-reaching Roman commerce was. This analysis was able to uncover the ways through which goods were transported, exchanged, and consumed over long distances.Also Read: AI and Ancient Wisdom – AI Deciphers 2000-Year-Old Buried ScrollApart from that, AI is also changing the way ancient trade networks are studied. Through the data analysis of different sources, like pottery distribution, inscriptions, and ancient shipping records, AI would be able to create a map indicating trade routes and economic ties that were spread over continents. AI can examine satellite images and geographical data to identify the most probable spots for economic activities.Archeologists Also Learned About the Financial Systems of MesopotamiaScientists employed AI to analyze thousands of cuneiform tablets from Mesopotamia. The clay tablets were engraved with one of the oldest forms of writing. These tablets frequently included records of transactions, loans, and sales.The AI learned from the texts how to detect patterns in them, and as a result, archeologists found out about the credit systems and financial instruments used by ancient Mesopotamians. This was done through the use of promissory notes and various complex loan agreements, which showed how sophisticated the economic system was.What Do the Researchers Think About AI’s Future Potential in ArchaeologyForte stresses that AI is changing the way archeologists operate by allowing for large-scale data analysis and simulations. AI’s capacity to handle and understand enormous amounts of data makes the visualization of the past in multiple dimensions and combinations possible. This method does not center on a particular objective view; rather, it provides a multilevel understanding of historical events.AI is also advancing remote sensing analysis and classification, detection of archaeological sites, and predictive modeling. Through the analysis of satellite and aerial images, AI algorithms can automatically detect patterns and find archaeological sites. This ability has been the key to simulating ecosystems and large-scale social transformations of different societies.Forte foresees AI as the future of archaeology. It may provide a guide for museum visitors and enable real-time classification of artifacts during excavations. He also foresees a future where archaeological datasets, projects, and publications will be more collaborative and accessible.Cryptopolitan reporting by Brenda Kanana

XRPL on-chain transactions jump 108% in Q1 2024

The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has seen over double the number of transactions during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the previous quarter, alongside the average transaction cost almost slashing in half, according to Ripple’s recent XRP market report.The XRPL on-chain transaction activity increased by 108% during the first quarter of 2024, with approximately 251.39 million recorded, compared to the total 121.03 million in the last quarter of 2023, as per the report published on May 17.Additionally, the average cost per transaction fell 45% to approximately 0.000856 USD.“As such, the decrease in average cost per transaction indicated a reset and that no network congestion occurred in the quarter,” it explained.Average cost per transaction on the XRPL dropped 45% in the first quarter of 2024. Source: RippeMeanwhile, XRP (XRP) trading volume distribution among cryptocurrency exchanges stayed steady in the initial quarter of the year, with Binance, Bybit, and Upbit accounting for more than 70% of the total traded volume.It was also highlighted that during Q1, the proportion of volume traded via fiat pairs dropped from 15% in Q4 to 11%. Presently, most of XRP trading occurs against Tether (USDT).Related: SEC files final response in Ripple XRP caseThe report also addressed the ongoing lawsuit against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) — a lawsuit filed by the SEC in December 2020 alleging that the executives conducted an initial public offering (IPO) of XRP, which it deemed an unregistered security during the capital-raising period.On April 22, Ripple responded to the SEC's request for $2 billion in remedies, disagreeing with it. Ripple argued that the law doesn't permit the SEC to demand disgorgement or interest on disgorgement unless they can prove someone was harmed.“In terms of next steps, both parties will wait for the Judge to make a determination on the final remedies - likely in the coming months,” Ripple explained.“Ripple remains confident that the Judge will approach the remedies phase fairly,” it added.Magazine: UK cannabis millionaire’s legal ‘deals on wheels’ via crypto
