99Bitcoins New Crypto ICO Raises $2 Million
BRC-20 tokens are seeing significant demand in this bull market, owing to their strong correlation with Bitcoin. With experts’ Bitcoin price target for 2024 ranging from $100k to $250k, these tokens could also deliver outsized returns. 
99Bitcoins’ entry in the BRC-20 race was met with significant hype and excitement, even from experts such as Michael Wrubel – who has over 300k subscribers on YouTube.

99Bitcoins is one of the top crypto and Bitcoin education platforms available, founded in 2013, even before the Ethereum blockchain. The platform has over 2.8 million subscribers while its YouTube channel has another 700k. 
The new 99BTC token is designed to be at the core of 99Bitcoins’ transition from just a crypto education platform to a learn-to-earn ecosystem. 
Essentially, the new cryptocurrency offers considerable financial incentives to the platform’s nearly 3 million subscribers, provided start holding the token. This includes alpha trading signals and strategies, access to VIP groups and lucrative staking rewards. Users can simply progress through 99Bitcoins’ learning material and receive free crypto in their wallets.

This learn-to-earn utility is the key factor driving 99BTC’s demand amongst smart-money traders. If even half of the platform’s subscribers decide to buy and hold the token, it could see significant growth after its launch. 
99BTC Token Passes SolidProof Audit
99BTC has also successfully completed its smart contract audit, publishing the audit report on its presale website. 
The report reveals no security risks in the contract that could put investors’ funds at peril. Furthermore, it is prone to common centralization risks. 
For instance, the contract is non-upgradable and therefore cannot be tampered with, especially since its ownership has also been renounced. This means that the owner cannot mint new tokens, blacklist addresses or pause the contract. 
The 99Bitcoins’ SolidProof audit alleviates some of the concerns associated with new cryptocurrencies while improving its fundamentals. However, experts weren’t overly concerned with the project’s legitimacy to begin with. 
Firstly, as previously mentioned, 99Bitcoins is not a new name in the crypto industry. More importantly, the token is not being run by an anonymous developer team. Instead, the 99Bitcoins founder and chairman Daniel Morgan is a well-known Web3 thought leader and evangelist. 
Morgan’s popular article on Bitcoin Obituaries – a satire on several times the mainstream media claimed BTC is going to zero – gained worldwide recognition. 
Furthermore, the 99BTC token has adopted community-centric tokenomics, with no portion of the supply reserved for the developer team. Investors can check out the exact token supply allocation on the presale website. 
99Bitcoins Airdrop Registration Deadline Approaches
99Bitcoins has announced an airdrop for community members, offering $99,999 in Bitcoin to 99 lucky winners. 
With over $1000 up for grabs for each winner, it is no wonder that the campaign already has close to 12,000 entries. However, late entrants will have just as much of a chance to secure the bounty as those registering early. 
Interested participants can head to the 99Bitcoins presale website and use the Gleam widget to complete a few simple requirements. The winners will be decided on July 19th. 
Considering that the Bitcoin price is on the verge of a major breakout, the airdrop winnings could end up turning into a small fortune for the lucky winners.

New Report from BNY Mellon, the Oldest Bank of the USA: "Institutional Interest in Cryptocurrencies is Increasing!" - Bitcoin Sistemi

A new report came from Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon), one of the Wall Street giants, where interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies continues to increase day by day.
BNY Mellon revealed in a recent report that family offices are increasingly adding cryptocurrencies to their portfolios.


Stating that family offices are investigating new investment opportunities and turning to them, BNY Mellon said that crypto currencies constitute 5% of the portfolios of family offices.
According to the 2024 BNY Mellon Wealth Management Survey , approximately 39% of family offices surveyed are either actively investing in or considering cryptocurrencies.





Stating that this rate underlines the intense interest in cryptocurrencies, which are the modern asset class, BNY Mellon said that some family offices remain hesitant about investing in BTC and cryptocurrencies.
While 38% of survey respondents expressed disinterest in cryptocurrencies, citing concerns about the high volatility of digital assets and the uncertain regulatory environment, they also stated that their hesitations included concerns about hacking and cybercrime in cryptocurrencies.



“In keeping with their entrepreneurial nature, family offices demonstrate that they are ready and willing to move forward into new and emerging opportunities.
“Cryptocurrencies make up 5% of portfolios, an allocation that would have been unthinkable a decade ago.”

Among those researching or investing in cryptocurrencies, spot cryptocurrency ETFs are clearly preferred, while some have expressed a preference for trading directly on exchanges.
What are Family Offices?
The concept of Family Office arose from the need for family members to diversify their assets and manage them in a performance-oriented manner while continuing their main pursuits.





Family offices are privately owned organizations established by wealthy families to manage their wealth, plan their family's financial future, take advantage of investment opportunities, and provide other services to family members.

South Korea classifies select NFTs as cryptocurrencies


South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has unveiled new regulations that classify specific non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as virtual assets, akin to cryptocurrencies. 



Announced Monday, the guidelines stipulate that NFTs that are mass-produced, divisible, and can be utilized for payments will be subject to this new categorization. 



This regulatory move is aimed at providing clarity within the evolving digital asset sector and ensuring that certain NFTs are governed by the same rules as traditional cryptocurrencies.



The FSC’s guidelines are a response to the increasing use of NFTs in ways that mirror cryptocurrencies, targeting those that are interchangeable and lack unique characteristics. 



The FSC said it will review NFT collections on a case-by-case basis to determine their classification, indicating a tailored approach to regulation rather than a blanket policy. 



This decision reflects South Korea’s recognition of the diverse functionalities of digital tokens, potentially leading to more regulated and stable NFT markets, and offering clearer direction for both creators and investors.



The announcement precedes the implementation of South Korea’s comprehensive crypto regulation, the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, scheduled for July 19, 2024. 



This act is designed to curb illegal activities in the crypto space and requires crypto service providers to protect user deposits, primarily through cold storage, and to participate in insurance schemes for user compensation in the event of security breaches.

What's Going On With Bitcoin-Miner Marathon Digital's Stock? - Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) - Benzinga

Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. MARA shares are moving Monday.  The company announced a decrease in Bitcoin BTC/USD production for May and Kerrisdale Capital issued a short report on Riot Platforms, Inc. RIOT last week.  What To Know:Marathon Digital announced on Wednesday that it produced 616 bitcoins in May, down from 850 in April and a 50% decrease from 1,245 bitcoins in May 2023. The company also said it had increased its holdings to 17,857 bitcoins. Marathon said it energized approximately 5,000 additional miners (c. 0.7 EH/s). Approximately 9,000 miners were reinstalled at the Ellendale facility, awaiting a return to full energization. As a result, Marathon’s operating fleet increased to approximately 246,000 bitcoin miners theoretically capable of producing 30.6 EH/s, with 237,000 miners (c. 29.3 EH/s) fully operational. In May, Marathon achieved a peak overall hash rate of 28.1 EH/s. “In May, we mitigated the impact of the April Halving event by increasing the number of blocks won, resulting in the production of 616 bitcoin, a decline of only 27%,” said Marathon CEO Fred Thiel. Kerrisdale Capital issued a short-seller report on peer bitcoin-miner Riot Platforms last Thursday which alleged that the crypto-mining industry is one of the worst business models for a public company due to unpredictable revenue, high capital requirements and fierce competition. The short report may have contributed to Marathon shares dipping to close down more than 7% Friday. Related News: Wedbush’s Dan Ives Says WWDC 2024 Is ‘Most Important Event For Apple In Over A Decade’: What To ExpectIs MARA A Good Stock To Buy?An investor can make a few decisions when deciding whether a stock is a good buy. In addition to valuation metrics and price action which you can find on Benzinga's quote pages  – like Marathon Digital Holdings‘ page for example – there are factors like whether or not a company pays a dividend or buys a large portion of its stock each quarter.These are known as capital allocation programs. Marathon Digital Holdings does not pay a dividend, but obviously has a few ways it can return value to shareholders. Feel free to search Benzinga's dividend calendar for the next company that is due to pay a dividend and determine what kind of yield you can earn for holding a share of the company.For example, if you're looking to earn an annualized return of 13.14%, you'll need to buy a share of Annaly Capital Management by June 28, 2024. Once done, you can expect to receive a nominal payout of $0.65 on July 31, 2024.Buyback programs are obviously different and highly variable. A company can approve a buyback program and purchase shares as it sees fit over the course of time in which the buyback was authorized. Looking through the latest news on Marathon Digital Holdings will often yield whether or not the company has approved a buyback program recently. Buyback programs usually serve as a support for share prices, serving as a backstop for demand.MARA Price Action: According to Benzinga Pro, Marathon Digital shares are up 0.52% at $19.35 at the time of publication Monday.Image: Pete Linforth from Pixabay

Bitcoin ETF snapshot: $2B of inflows, but BTC price stuck - Blockworks


Bitcoin marched closer to an all-time high price last week amid particularly strong inflows into bitcoin ETFs.
But uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s potential interest rate cut outlook appears to be keeping BTC from hitting a new peak.
The US spot bitcoin ETF category notched $887 million of net inflows on June 4, according to Farside Investors data — the second-highest total for the segment in a single day since they launched in January.

In total, the 11 funds reeled in roughly $1.8 billion in assets from June 3 to June 7, the data shows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust — now the largest bitcoin ETF — accounted for $948 million of those inflows, while the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) welcomed $679 million.
Net inflows for the category now total nearly $15.7 billion after about five months on the market.
Trading volumes across crypto exchange-traded products reached $12.8 billion last week, according to CoinShares — up 55% from the week before. Inflows were seen far and wide across providers, CoinShares research head James Butterfill wrote in a Monday report. 
Slight outflows of $31 million for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) reflect a continued slowdown of asset hemorrhaging for the fund.
“We believe this turn-around in sentiment is a direct response to weaker than expected macro data in the US, bringing forward monetary policy rate cut expectations,” Butterfill added.
BTC’s price hit nearly $72,000 on Friday before retreating further from its high of more than $73,000. One bitcoin was trading at roughly $69,300 at 10 am ET Monday — down 0.4% on the day but up 2.4% from a week ago.  
The sell-off came after US employment data dropped Friday. The US economy added 272,000 jobs in May — a higher figure than analysts expected.
Other macro factors are also in the mix. The European Central Bank went ahead with its first rate cut in five years — from 4% to 3.75%.
“But even the most bullish of traders appreciates the Fed will surely need to follow suit for bitcoin to take the next step,” Stocklytics analyst Neil Roarty said in a statement. 
The Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting comes Wednesday. Pepperstone research strategist Michael Brown said he doesn’t expect the May employment report to be a “game-changer” for the Fed’s policy outlook.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz and others have said they believe bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the end of the year — citing the ETF interest and possible US interest rate cuts.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Supporter Elon Musk Mentioned a Different Memecoin for the First Time! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Tesla CEO Elon Musk, known for his support of Dogecoin, talked about the popular Solana (SOL)-based memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF) during a live broadcast.
Accordingly, while Musk was seen stating that he “knew Dogwifhat” in the video, this led to speculation and excitement among WIF's millions of followers.


Because WIF investors were excited, considering Elon Musk's support for Dogecoin (DOGE) in the past.
Elon Musk has also not mentioned any small memecoins before and focused on Dogecoin.





While this was the first time Musk mentioned a memecoin other than Dogecoin, Tesla CEO announced that he preferred DOGE over Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second largest memecoin.
For this reason, while his words about WIF were met with surprise, the price did not pump as in the DOGE posts. WIF investors did not engage in FOMO.


Although WIF rose slightly following Musk's remarks, the WIF price is trading at $2.68, down a small 0.4% over the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin ETFs see third-largest daily inflow amidst rate cut anticipation - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Crypto investment products saw a massive inflow of $2 billion so far in June, fuelled by the expectation around rate cuts in the US. According to asset management firm CoinShares, these products saw a cumulative $4.3 billion inflow for the past five weeks. Bitcoin continued to be the primary focus of investors, with inflows of $1.97 billion for the week. Conversely, short Bitcoin products experienced outflows for the third consecutive week, totaling $5.3 million.Ethereum also saw a notable uptick in interest, with its best week of inflows since March, totaling $69 million. This is likely a response to the unexpected SEC decision to permit spot-based ETFs. Meanwhile, the rest of the altcoins experienced less activity, though Fantom and XRP stood out with inflows of $1.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively.CaptionRegionally, the US registered the majority of inflows observed, amounting to $1.98 billion in the last week alone, with the first day of the week witnessing the third-largest daily inflow on record. The iShares Bitcoin ETF has now overtaken the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, boasting $21 billion in assets under management. Hong Kong came second, surpassing $26 million last week and also amounting to the second-largest year-to-date inflow volume of $326 million.Trading volumes for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) surged to $12.8 billion for the week, marking a 55% increase from the previous week. In a notable shift, inflows were recorded across nearly all providers, while the usual outflows from established firms slowed down. CoinShares’ analysts attribute this change in market sentiment to weaker-than-expected US macroeconomic data, which has led to anticipations of monetary policy rate cuts. The positive market movement pushed the total assets under management above the $100 billion threshold for the first time since March of this year.

Ripple CTO Responds To Rumors That The Crypto Firm Is Abandoning XRP | Bitcoinist.com


								The Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has responded to rumours that the Company might be considering abandoning its association with the XRP token. The crypto firm has so far provided XRP with its major utilities, and such rumors could negatively impact its price.
Ripple Is Not Abandoning XRP
Schwartz clarified in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Ripple wasn’t abandoning XRP and that the post that kicked off the rumors was misunderstood. The rumors began when an X user (@AspenSignals) posted Schwartz’s cover photo on his X platform and asked if Ripple was abandoning XRP. 

Schwartz’s cover photo suggested that the company was abandoning XRP due to a “web of corruption” in the financial world, which was set to hinder them from achieving their goal of providing instant payment services using XRP. 
Source: X
However, Schwartz stated that the lines related to a fictional pitch for a fictional movie. He added that the circumstances to make the pitch match reality haven’t happened yet, suggesting that Ripple wasn’t facing such a challenge. However, Ripple facing such a challenge seemed feasible considering its long-running legal battle against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
At some point, the Commission was believed to have maliciously enforced an action against the crypto firm based on claims made by Ethereum insider Steven Nerayoff. Moreover, the lawsuit has had a negative impact on Ripple’s operations and could have easily forced them to abandon XRP due to regulatory scrutiny. 
Thankfully, Schwartz’s swift response has helped clear things up and helped alleviate concerns among XRP community members. XRP is at the centre of Ripple’s operations, and the crypto firm uses it to provide cross-border payment services. Ripple is also the largest XRP holder, holding almost 50% of the crypto token’s supply. That is another reason why XRP community members may have been concerned, considering that the crypto firm might dump its XRP holdings on the market if it abandons XRP. 
Still Part Of Long-Term Plans
In an interview with CNBC, Ripple’s President Monica Long reaffirmed that XRP was still part of the company’s long-term plans. She made this remark when she was quizzed on whether or not there was still a need for the XRP token, with Ripple making plans to launch its stablecoin. Long clarified that XRP will still be used in its operations, noting that the crypto firm uses a “mix of assets” to serve its payment customers. 

She also highlighted that XRP serves a unique purpose and is a bridge asset for the “long tail of currency pairs.” She also alluded to XRP’s future use case, noting that it will play a major role as Ripple tokenizes more assets on-chain. Long stated that XRP will be used to provide liquidity to these assets.

Cardano's 'Age of Voltaire' nears with major blockchain upgrade

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed that the blockchain is on course for its “most significant milestone in history,” with the impending Chang fork setting the stage for the “Age of Voltaire.”In a June 9 social media post, Hoskinson said:“It looks like June will be the month that Cardano Node will reach 9.0. This means that Cardano is Chang fork ready and waiting for 70 percent of the SPOs to install the new node. Then, a hard fork can occur pushing Cardano into the Age of Voltaire.”Age of VoltaireThe Chang upgrade will mark a pivotal moment for Cardano as it introduces crucial tools and infrastructure to support the “Age of Voltaire.”The Voltaire era is set to provide the final elements needed for the network to achieve self-sustainability. It empowers network participants to propose Cardano improvements, subject to stakeholder voting that leverages the existing staking and delegation process.Voltaire also establishes a treasury system to finance future network development. A portion of all transaction fees will be pooled to fund development efforts decided upon through the voting process.Once these voting and treasury systems are operational, Cardano will be fully decentralized and no longer be under IOHK’s management. The community will take the reins and be equipped to nurture and advance Cardano from its secure, decentralized foundation.Hoskinson, commenting on the update, said:“It’s the most significant milestone in the history of Cardano and for the industry as a whole. Cardano will be a decentralized civilization spanning the entire world with millions of residents.

XRP to the Moon? Crypto Analyst Bullish on XRP Price with $7.5 Target


							

XRP Atlas line targets $1.5, with high conviction to break the White Triangle pattern.



Critical Fib 1.618 zone ($6.5-$7.5) identified for profit-taking.



A weekly close above Fib 1.618 could lead to mid-double-digit targets near Fib 2.414 & 2.618.




XRP’s price could be headed for a significant upswing based on two key technical indicators and current market trends. As per the analysis shared by Egrag Crypto, the Atlas Line for XRP is raised to $7.5 with $1.5 as the initial target. Expressing a high conviction of breaking the White Triangle pattern, Egrag Crypto is confident XRP will surpass this initial resistance level. 







Next, the analysis highlights a key price zone between $6.5 and $7.5, known as the Fib 1.618, where profit-taking is expected to occur. Traders and investors are therefore advised to keep a close eye on this zone for potential price movements and adjust their positions accordingly. If XRP manages to overcome the Fib 1.618 level in a week, the analyst predicts the next targets to be in the mid-double digits, near the Fib 2.414 and 2.618 levels. This suggests further upside potential in XRP’s price action, as long as the current bullish momentum is maintained.







Doubling down on the forecast, the crypto analyst also urged the XRP Army to remain steadfast since the rotational profits from other altcoins are expected to pour into XRP once it starts to pump. Referring to the Ripple-affiliated token as the “black horse,” the analyst emphasized the optimistic outlook for XRP’s future performance in the market.









This update highlights key levels to watch and potential price targets based on technical tools. However, it’s essential to conduct thorough research before making any trading decisions.

FLOKI Memecoin to Enter India with Education Project


                                FLOKI to Enter India with an Educational Project                                FLOKI, a globally popular memecoin, is planning to build a school in India as part of its charitable initiative. This step is part of FLOKI's mission to promote education in developing countries. After successful projects in Nigeria, Laos, Guatemala, and Ghana, FLOKI is now focusing on India. India, with its rapidly growing economy and being the world's most populous country, holds significant cultural and educational importance. However, many parts of the country still struggle with access to quality education. Recognizing these challenges, Memecoin FLOKI aims to improve the education sector in India by establishing schools.According to FLOKI's team, they are ready to partner with interested NGOs in India to expedite this mission. FLOKI has announced that organizations willing to collaborate on this initiative can contact their team. FLOKI believes that through this partnership, millions of school children will have better educational opportunities. The initiative aims to provide education to school children and guide them towards a brighter future. FLOKI is committed to bringing about significant change in the education sector in India through this initiative. These schools will not only aim to revolutionize education but also play a crucial role in the overall development of children. Through its initiatives in India, FLOKI is advancing the Global Education Mission. If successful, FLOKI plans to implement similar initiatives in other parts of India.FLOKI’s Goal with Charitable Initiatives in IndiaSuch initiatives are expected to increase the popularity of Memecoin Project FLOKI in India. As everyone knows, over 20% of India’s young population invests in the cryptocurrency market. A report states that 25% of Indian cryptocurrency investors hold Shiba Inu. With this initiative, FLOKI aims to challenge SHIB’s popularity in India. This move could attract a large number of investors from India to FLOKI in the future.

Uniswap Labs Acquires 'Crypto: The Game' Ahead of Next Season - Decrypt

Crypto: The Game, the "Survivor"-inspired reality competition that went viral earlier this year, is coming back for a third season—under new ownership.On Monday, Uniswap Labs—the startup behind the leading Ethereum decentralized exchange, Uniswap—announced that it has acquired Crypto: The Game. Founders Dylan Abruscato, Tyler Cagle, and Bryan Lee will join Uniswap Labs to continue steering the direction of the experience, along with helping Uniswap Labs craft its own messaging around decentralized finance. Crypto: The Game is an on-chain survival game that quickly gained buzz on Crypto Twitter amid its first season, during which players competed in a series of challenges—such as playing Pac-Man online or real-world scavenger hunts—for $115,000 worth of ETH.As in "Survivor," players were split into tribes, and winning or losing challenges determined whether or not a tribe would have to vote members off. The last person standing wins. Both seasons of Crypto: The Game have captured significant attention—and generated a lot of drama, too. The first season was won by a pseudonymous player from a rural town in Japan, who wrote poems for his fellow teammates and won by being an all-around good person. The next season unfolded much differentlySeason 2 saw some 800 players spend over 4,000 hours combined on the game’s website and tackling its challenges—and concluded with a group of players teaming up to buy back into the game after a brutal backstabbing eliminated them from the competition. They collectively won the $210,000 prize and donated all the proceeds to the Tornado Cash Legal Defense Fund. Several members of Uniswap Labs participated in the first season, and then the firm got onboard with season two by sponsoring one of the challenges—a “custom crypto scavenger hunt,” as Abruscato described it to Decrypt.“I think that made them realize that we kind of cracked the code for bringing folks on-chain,” he added.When asked about his team’s decision to join Uniswap Labs instead of staying independent, Abruscato told Decrypt that he wants to continue to scale Crypto: The Game. He believes that Uniswap Labs builds amazing products, and hopes to tap into that expertise to take the game to new heights. What can future Crypto: The Game players look forward to? While a date hasn’t been set for the upcoming season, Abruscato affirmed that all of the elements of the game that the community has grown to know and love will continue to be there.“We see this as an opportunity to leverage their expertise and our learnings from previous seasons,” Abruscato explained. “There will still be new games, new twists, and new drama—just all under the Uniswap Labs umbrella.”Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Monday morning trading today has been marked by significant moves in several stocks, driven by a combination of company-specific developments and broader market trends. Here are the top three you should be watching.



Private equity giant KKR & Co. Inc. (NYSE: KKR) is set to join the S&P 500 index, sending its shares soaring. General Motors (NYSE: GM) is partnering with Costco’s (NASDAQ: COST) Auto Program to boost electric vehicle (EV) sales, tapping into the retailer’s vast membership base. Meanwhile, activist hedge fund Elliott Management has taken a substantial stake in Southwest Airlines (LUV), pushing for leadership changes to turn around the struggling carrier.



KKR Set to Join S&P 500, Stock Soars



KKR’s impending inclusion in the S&P 500 index has prompted a surge in its stock price, with shares up 10% to an all-time intraday high of $108.



The move is expected to drive demand from index-tracking funds, further bolstering the stock’s performance. KKR has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 1-year (+97.59%), 3-year (+101.49%), and 5-year (+379.62%) periods, showcasing the company’s strong growth trajectory. As of 11:40 AM EDT, KKR’s market cap stands at $99.656 billion.





GM Partners with Costco to Boost EV Sales



General Motors is leveraging Costco’s Auto Program to expand its reach in the EV market. The partnership enables Costco’s 50 million-plus US members to purchase GM’s electric vehicles at discounted prices. With a growing interest in EVs among Costco members, GM sees this collaboration as a significant opportunity to increase sales.



The automaker is gearing up to release a range of affordable EV models, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV and an updated Chevrolet Bolt. Costco members will enjoy $1,000 off select EV models from GM’s Cadillac and Chevrolet brands this summer.

The stock, currently trading at $30.26, has lagged behind the S&P 500 over the 1-year (+1.07%), 3-year (-46.47%), and 5-year (-37.25%) periods. Southwest’s market cap currently stands at $18.109 billion.

Sifu’s UwU Lend reportedly hacked for $20M, Curve’s Egorov among affected


UwU Lend, created by notorious fraudster Michael Patryn (a.k.a. 0xSifu) has been hacked for almost $20 million, according to an alert by blockchain security firm Cyvers.
An initial post on X (formerly Twitter) drew attention to $14 million worth of losses before Cyvers identified further losses, totaling $19.5 million worth of crypto assets.
The attack transactions show the use of ‘flash loans’ which can be used to manipulate asset prices on decentralized finance (DeFi) apps. Audit firm Peckshield noted that, in this case, five stablecoin pairs were targeted in order to influence the sUSDe price feed, or ‘oracle.’
UwU Lend is a ‘fork’ of DeFi’s premier lending protocol Aave, specifically its v2 codebase. In November, Aave alerted the community to a bug found in the v2 code which was later remediated by disabling stable borrow rates.
The protocol was paused shortly after the attack, according to the official UwU Lend X account.

Stolen funds include USDC, FRAX, crvUSD and blUSD. These were converted to ETH before being consolidated in a new address which currently holds over 4000 ETH ($15 million). The hacker was funded two days ago via the sanctioned crypto mixing service Tornado Cash.
Among the users affected by the hack was Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov. UwU Lend is one of several platforms he uses to borrow stablecoins against his own CRV holdings. The price of CRV has dropped around 5% since the hack, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Patryn was revealed to be behind the pseudonym 0xSifu by on-chain detective ZachXBT in February of 2022. Previously, he had co-founded the Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, which lost nine figures of user funds in 2019.
Since then, Patryn had worked alongside Daniele Sestagalli, building a DeFi empire known as ‘Frog Nation.’ The projects included Magic Internet Money, Wonderland, and Abracadabra, which was itself hacked for $6.5 million earlier this year.
Over the past week, Ethereum L2 Loopring reported a compromise of its ‘smart wallet’ 2FA system, landing a hacker $5 million worth of ETH, and crypto exchange Lykke was reportedly hacked for $19.5 million of BTC and ETH.

Bitfarms plays defense as rival Riot still eyes takeover - Blockworks


Bitfarms is looking to ward off an attempt by Riot Platforms to take control of the company — at least in the near-term. 
The bitcoin miner rejected Riot’s unsolicited April bid to buy the company, noting in a statement last month that the deal “significantly undervalues” Bitfarms. 
Bitfarms said its board of directors was in the midst of a “strategic alternatives review process,” which includes evaluating options such as continuing to execute its business plan or selling the company.
Riot has declined to participate in Bitfarms’ review process in an attempt to “undermine” it and “thwart the interest of third parties,” Bitfarms claims.
A Riot spokesperson did not immediately return Blockworks’ request for comment.
Read more: A deeper look at Riot’s ‘hostile’ bid to take over Bitfarms 
Now, Bitfarms has put in place a shareholder rights plan to “preserve the integrity” of the board of directors’ process, it said in a Monday news release.
It would allow the company to attach a so-called right to each common share issued after June 20. Those rights become exercisable if an owner holds 15% or more of Bitfarms’ outstanding shares between June 20 and Sept. 10.
In essence, shareholder rights plans often seek to issue more shares as a way to limit the control of a shareholder seeking to take over the company.
Riot Platforms owned roughly 3.6% of Bitfarms stock upon making an offer to buy all of Bitfarms’ remaining shares on April 22. Riot now holds about 11.6% of the company’s stock and said it intended to requisition a special shareholders meeting to nominate what it calls “well-qualified and independent directors.”
Riot plans to “review its investment in the company on a continuing basis,” the company said in a June 5 statement.
If shareholders don’t ratify the plan within six months, the plan will be terminated.
The plan was approved “to ensure, to the extent possible, that the board has sufficient opportunity to identify, develop and negotiate alternatives,” the Monday news release states.   
The miner has pointed out its planned 223% hash rate increase and 40% efficiency improvement in 2024, saying that moving forward toward those projections maximizes shareholder value.
A Bitfarms spokesperson did not immediately comment further.  
Peter Stoneberg, managing director at crypto advisory firm Architect Partners, previously told Blockworks that Bitfarms was “doing everything right to put up a strong defense to Riot’s bid.”
The company, for example, last month named Moelis & Company as its financial adviser, as well as Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom to help it with legal matters.

Fintech Company Robinhood Expands Cryptocurrency Activities After Acquiring Bitstamp! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Robinhood's recent acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp marks a significant expansion in its global footprint, according to a report by investment bank Architect Partners.
Robinhood's Acquisition of Bitstamp Expands Global Reach
This strategic move underscores the growing importance of cryptocurrency in Robinhood's business model, accounting for 20% of the company's total revenue in the first quarter of 2024.


Despite facing regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Robinhood continues to strengthen its digital asset business.
Last month, the company received a Wells Notice from the SEC, a preliminary warning that the regulator could take enforcement action regarding Robinhood's listing of certain crypto tokens that are viewed as potentially unlicensed securities.





Architect Partners emphasized that the acquisition of Bitstamp would significantly increase Robinhood's ability to operate globally and mitigate the potential impact of regulatory actions in the United States.
This acquisition immediately expands global reach to enable participation regardless of U.S. actions, the report said.


The acquisition is also expected to strengthen Robinhood's institutional offerings and position the company as a major player in the emerging digital asset space.
With its ability to serve institutions, Robinhood is emerging as one of the few publicly traded companies with a strong influence on the cryptocurrency market.






Known for its long operational history and extensive global licensing, Bitstamp was acquired by Robinhood for $200 million in cash.
This price represents a significant discount from the $500 million valuation Bitstamp received during its majority investment in 2018.
Architect Partners described Bitstamp as a “significant asset” for Robinhood, citing Bitstamp's established reputation and global reach.

Robinhood's expansion through this acquisition underscores the company's commitment to growing its presence in the cryptocurrency industry despite regulatory challenges.
This move is seen as a strategic step to enhance service offerings and maintain a competitive advantage in the global digital asset market.

Microsoft’s AI Outsourcing to OpenAI Could Benefit Google, Says Okta CEO | Cryptoglobe


                                
Microsoft has recently delegated the development of its premier artificial intelligence tools and software to OpenAI, a decision that could potentially benefit its competitor, Google, according to Todd McKinnon, CEO of Okta, a top provider of cloud-based software solutions for businesses to manage and secure who has access to their digital resources.



Per a report by Ryan Browne for CNBC, as Google seeks to maintain its supremacy in search, it continues to control its research and development efforts, unlike Microsoft, which is outsourcing these crucial components to OpenAI.



The report says that Google’s foundational work on transformers, the deep-learning models crucial for generative AI technologies, underscores its strong position. McKinnon claims that these models, which understand context and meaning by analyzing sequential data, were developed by Google and its DeepMind research team and that this technology forms the backbone of many large language models (LLMs) driving recent AI advancements.



McKinnon expressed concerns that Microsoft’s strategic move might reduce its role in AI development to that of a consultancy, given that many of its top products now incorporate technology from OpenAI. Microsoft has invested heavily in OpenAI, with its total investment reportedly reaching $13 billion. This investment is intended to accelerate AI breakthroughs and ensure that the benefits are widely shared.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The partnership has led to significant integrations of OpenAI’s technology into Microsoft’s products, such as the Copilot generative AI chatbot and PCs equipped with generative AI software. This heavy reliance on OpenAI has raised questions about Microsoft’s strategic positioning in the AI market.



The CNBC report also mentions that Google faces its own set of challenges. Google has encountered several public issues with its AI products. For example, its AI chatbot Gemini, initially called Bard, provided incorrect answers in a promotional ad, and the Gemini image generator produced inaccurate historical images, leading Google to temporarily suspend the tool.



The immense investments by major tech firms in AI have also raised concerns about competition and cybersecurity. McKinnon warned that challenges such as disinformation could impede technological progress and predicted that stringent regulations might result in only the most powerful companies retaining control over AI. While the potential for artificial intelligence is substantial, he cautioned that excessive regulation could limit the industry to a few dominant players.

Binance Breaks 200 Million User Barrier: Can They Weather the Storm?


								The past two years for Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, have been a whirlwind. Regulatory battles, hefty fines, and even the arrest of its founder CZ, the exchange painted a picture of an industry titan under siege.
Yet, Binance has emerged unscathed. On Saturday, the exchange announced it had surpassed a staggering 200 million users, solidifying its position as the undisputed king of crypto.
Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, attended the company’s celebration and sent the users his best wishes. He admitted that the community’s support was a major factor in the journey’s success. His message said:

We have hit 200M users Binance! This milestone wouldn’t have been possible without YOU – our incredible community … Thank you! The journey to 1 billion users continues. Let’s keep building together.


Unfazed By The Storm
This milestone comes amidst a backdrop of intense scrutiny. Since 2022, the company has faced a barrage of regulatory hurdles from countries like the UK, Singapore, and the US.
Accusations of lax anti-money laundering measures and unregistered securities offerings resulted in hefty fines and limitations on operations. In a particularly dramatic turn, news broke of CZ’s arrest in China in early 2024, raising fears for the exchange’s future.


However, the crypto exchange seems to have weathered the storm remarkably well. Not only did it maintain its user base, but it also managed to grow it significantly.
Compared to 130 million users reported in 2023, Binance has added a staggering 70 million in just two years. This resilience suggests a deep well of user loyalty, perhaps due to its wide range of crypto offerings, competitive fees, and user-friendly platform.
BTC is currently trading at $69,390. Chart: TradingView
Growing Concerns
While Binance’s growth is undeniably impressive, it also raises concerns about the increasing centralization of the cryptocurrency market. With a user base representing a whopping 35% of the global crypto community (estimated at 562 million in 2024),

The company wields immense power. A potential future scenario where Binance experiences a security breach or faces stricter regulations could have a devastating ripple effect on the entire crypto market.
Unanswered Questions
The announcement of this milestone credits the growth to a perfect alignment between Binance’s products and market demand. However, it does not specify what drives this demand.
Are users attracted by Binance’s extensive coin selection, the convenience of its mobile app, or are they simply unaware of the controversies surrounding the exchange?

The Solana Foundation removes the validators due to sandwich attacks

The Solana Foundation has recently taken decisive action by removing a group of validator operators from its delegation program due to their involvement in sandwich attacks against users. This move, aimed at safeguarding the integrity and security of the network, underscores the foundation’s commitment to maintaining a fair and secure ecosystem for all participants.

What is a sandwich attack? Why is it dangerous for Solana Foundation?
To fully understand the gravity of the situation, it is essential to understand what sandwich attacks are. Sandwich attacks are a form of market manipulation in cryptocurrencies and decentralized exchanges (DEX). In a sandwich attack, a malicious actor observes a pending transaction on the blockchain and inserts two transactions: one before and one after the observed one. The goal is to exploit the price fluctuations caused by the original transaction to make a profit. In other words, the malicious actor “inserts” their transactions “around” the target transaction, hence the term “sandwich”.
The Solana Foundation has discovered that some validators in its delegation program were actively participating in these sandwich attacks. This behavior not only undermines users’ trust in the network, but also goes against the rules and principles established by the foundation itself.
The foundation acted quickly to remove these validators, emphasizing that such harmful practices will not be tolerated. This decision was made in line with the policies of the Solana Foundation, which prohibit any activity that could damage the integrity of the network or disadvantage users. The removal of these operators not only protects users but also serves as a warning to other validators who might consider similar practices.
The importance of the delegation program
The delegation program of the Solana Foundation is a crucial element of the Solana ecosystem. It allows stakers to delegate their SOL tokens to trusted validators, thus contributing to the security and decentralization of the network. The validators, in turn, earn rewards for their work in validating transactions and maintaining the network.
However, trust is a fundamental component in this system. Stakers must be able to trust that the validators are operating honestly and transparently. The actions of the Solana Foundation demonstrate that the organization is willing to take rigorous measures to maintain this trust, ensuring that only validators who adhere to the rules and ethical principles can participate in the delegation program.
The removal of validators involved in sandwich attacks has several implications for the Solana community. Firstly, it strengthens security and trust in the network. Users can be certain that the foundation will closely monitor the behavior of validators and take action against any malicious activity.
Secondly, this action can encourage other validators to maintain high ethical standards, knowing that their actions will be monitored and that any misconduct will not be tolerated. This can lead to a healthier and more responsible community of validators, further improving the stability and reputation of the Solana network.
Conclusions
The decision by the Solana Foundation to remove validators involved in sandwich attacks from the delegation program is a clear signal of its commitment to the security and integrity of the network. This move protects users from harmful practices and strengthens trust in the Solana ecosystem. In a rapidly evolving sector like that of cryptocurrencies, transparency and decisive action are fundamental to maintaining a safe and reliable environment.
The Solana Foundation has demonstrated its willingness to take the necessary measures to ensure that the network remains a fair place for all participants, sending a strong message to the entire community: manipulation and harmful practices will not be tolerated. With this action, the foundation not only protects its users but also contributes to building a safer and more transparent future for the entire blockchain ecosystem.

The Shiba Inu community is closing in on a major milestone: 10,000 signatures for a Shiba Inu ETF petition. Led by figures like Heber Mayen, the campaign has gained significant traction in just 58 days, needing only 300 more signatures to reach its ambitious goal.







Since its inception, the SHIB BPP initiative and other dedicated supporters have relentlessly rallied for signatures, urging fellow community members to participate in the drive. The petition, addressed to Grayscale Investments CEO, Michael Sonnenshein, aims to draw attention to the demand for an ETF specifically tailored for Shiba Inu.



With over 9,700 signatures, the campaign has surpassed its initial target of 1,000 set for February 26. Notably, the past week has seen a spike in support, with 140 new signatories. Despite the community’s efforts, Grayscale Investments has remained mum, leaving enthusiasts anxiously awaiting a response. Grayscale is a major player in the cryptocurrency ETF space, having launched successful Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.









Grayscale does not currently offer SHIB ETFs, which has led supporters to stress on the importance of having one. Proponents believe a regulated and accessible ETF could boost SHIB’s stability and drive mainstream adoption. They point to Google Trends data as evidence of SHIB’s popularity and demand.



In light of these developments, the Shiba Inu community has remained optimistic about the potential for their efforts to gain recognition and influence. The proximity to the 10,000 signature milestone underscores the strong support for the initiative and the growing investor interest in Shiba Inu.

OKX SIM-swap leads to discovery of 2FA security flaw


A flaw in the two-factor authentication (2FA) security system used by crypto and derivatives exchange OKX has apparently been discovered after two users reported that their accounts had been hacked and their funds drained in a suspected SIM-swapping attack.
The founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist, Yu Xian, reported that the users received SMS risk notifications from Hong Kong before a new API key was created as part of their account authentication process.  
Following up on these reports, security analysts Dilation Effect (DE) claims to have found a flaw in OKX’s authentication system. It said that users are able to switch from 2FA to ‘lower security verification methods,’ like SMS verification, during OKX’s sensitive user operations. 

Such sensitive actions include withdrawals, whitelisting addresses, changing the login password, and disabling 2FA verification. DE says these actions don’t trigger a 24-hour withdrawal ban and that a ban is only triggered when logging into a new device. 
Additionally, if an address is whitelisted, DE claims large amounts of crypto can be withdrawn without the need for additional verification. “This quick analysis reveals that OKX’s security settings lack baseline design. Possibly to enhance user experience, OKX has made significant compromises in security,” DE said.

However, Yu claimed to be unsure if Google’s authenticator is the ‘key point’ in this attack, adding, “There’s no need to panic. If the impact is large, the performance of related events should be more exaggerated. Let’s wait for more disclosures.”
SlowMist claims that they are tracking the wallets of the hacker behind the breach of the two accounts and have asked anyone suffering a similar exploit to contact them.

Bitcoin's Consolidation Phase Hits Record Duration: Analyst | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency asset continues to attract positive sentiment due to its recent price uptick. Popular crypto analyst and trader Mags has delved into the current price action of BTC, highlighting that the crypto asset’s current consolidation phase is the longest in its history, unfolding in the midst of an ongoing bull cycle.
This extended period of consolidation often precedes substantial volatility, which raises the possibility that Bitcoin could be preparing for a big comeback.
End Of Consolidation Phase To Trigger Notable Price Movement
For a record-breaking amount of time (87 days), Bitcoin has been trading in an extremely narrow range that has outlasted prior periods of consolidation. Mags points out that despite the general bullish feeling in the market, which usually propels more substantial price swings, there is a lot of consolidation taking on. 

According to the crypto expert, before entering price recovery, BTC often consolidates around its all-time highs, as seen in past bull cycles. However, the current consolidation is the longest of all of them.
During the 2027 bull cycle, Mags noted that the crypto asset consolidated for about 48 days before breaking out on the upside. Also, in 2020, BTC witnessed a 21-day consolidation period before regaining its upward momentum. 
BTC consolidating for 87 days thus far | Source: Mags on X
Meanwhile, in this current cycle, BTC has been consolidating for the past 87 days and still counting, surpassing the durations of previous consolidation phases. Thus, the crypto analyst claims there will be a huge upside rise whenever the price breaks out of this stabilizing phase.
The post read:
Each cycle, we have noticed a similar pattern where Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs before it enters price discovery. Out of all the consolidations, the current one is the longest. 
Although the recent stabilizing phase has turned out to be the longest, crypto expert, Milky Bull has underscored the significance of the development. Milky Bull is confident that the consolidation will lead to significant price movements. “The longer the consolidation the higher it moves when it breaks out,” the expert stated.
Furthermore, he has pointed out a bullish divergence for BTC, which also indicates a robust price strength. Should the crypto asset break out of the current consolidation phase, Milky Bull anticipates a surge to the $85,000 price level before rising to the $110,000 mark.
Bitcoin Demonstrating Optimistic Sentiment
Following a steep decline over the weekend that caused the cryptocurrency to retreat from recent highs, Bitcoin’s price starts the week on a positive note. The weekend decline was caused by a drop in the entire crypto market, which led to major cryptocurrencies’ value plummeting.

However, Bitcoin appears to have rebounded alongside several other notable crypto assets. Due to its rebound, the digital asset has gained investor interest and generated new sentiment about its potential for long-term growth. 
At the time of writing, BTC was trading above $65,000, indicating a 0.15% increase in the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization and trading volume were also up by 0.15% and 40% in the past day.

AMD vs. NVDA: Which AI Stock Can Gain More in the Short Term? - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



On Monday, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock began trading with its new 10-for-1 stock-split adjustment. While it caused a brief -2.3% drop, NVDA shares rallied and continue to trade sideways at present $120 per share. NVDA stock is now “cheaper” than the company’s long-standing competitor at that price point.



Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is trading at $163 per share, 75% above its 52-week low point of $93.11. Year-to-date, AMD is only up 19%, compared to NVDA, which is 151%.



Given that Nvidia’s stock split now acts as a foil against the “missing the boat” mentality, is Nvidia likely to gain further ground, or does AMD hold surprises to catch up?



Shifting Market Domains for NVDA and AMD



Both companies compete in the PC market as their original bread and butter. AMD, in particular, dominates the console gaming market, with the PS5’s GPU hailing from AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture. Likewise, Microsoft’s Xbox consoles use AMD’s CPU and GPU solutions.



This points to AMD’s prowess in the System-on-Chip (SoC) domain, further advanced by the latest accelerated processing units (APUs) in the Ryzen 8000G series. Comparable to the performance of gaming consoles, these single-package chips make a compelling case for cheap mini PCs over buying new consoles. 



However, Nvidia outgrew that sector of consumer desktops and laptops by shifting to data centers and high-performance computing (HPC). At the same time, Nvidia retains a lion’s market share in GPUs at 80% vs AMD’s 19%, per Jon Peddie data as of Q4 2023.



Yet, there was a noticeable trend of AMD increasing its market share year-over-year by 7% while Nvidia’s decreased by 2%. Nonetheless, Nvidia more than compensated with massive data center revenue growth of 427% YoY to $22.6 billion. 



For comparison, AMD reported for the same Q1 ‘24 period total revenue of $5.47 billion, which is a YoY uptick of only 2%. And of that total revenue, AMD could boast only $2.3 billion in the data center segment.





Can AMD Take the Bite out of the Nvidia-Generated AI Pie?



Clearly, Nvidia’s agility in pushing the H100 chips to train early AI language models was a critical first-mover gambit that paid off substantially. AMD now has to compete with Nvidia’s dominant 94% market share in the data center segment, per Mercury Research. Nvidia accomplished this feat by pushing its own Ageia PhysX framework for simulations, alongside numerous libraries, CUDA Toolkit, HPC SDK, Modulus, and IndeX.



In other words, Nvidia cracked the formula for seamless development of AI-powered apps in conjunction with the offering of AI chips. On the other hand, AMD’s purportedly more cost-effective MI325X accelerator chips only address the hardware side of the equation. AMD’s Vitis AI framework will then have to rely on the adoption rate of AMD’s new chips.



As of the last earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su expects modest growth from data center GPU revenue, from $3.5 billion guidance in January to over $4 billion by the end of 2024. In the meantime, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised the AMD MI300X series, for its Azure cloud infrastructure, noting that “it offers the best price-performance on GPT-4 for inference”.



On the other hand, Elon Musk prioritized Nvidia chips for his X and xAI companies.



Moreover, it will take a while before AMD catches up with Nvidia’s in-sync releases of GPUs with proprietary CUDA Toolkit versions. As noted, these toolkits have thus far locked in many AI developers and researchers.



For those familiar with the history of Nvidia/AMD’s struggle in the PC gaming market, this mirrors the deployment of Nvidia’s real-time ray tracing (RTX), deep learning super sampling (DLSS), G-Sync, and other standards to lock in gamers. This approach landed Nvidia in a position to dominate gaming and data center segments.



Which Company Has Better Underlying Tech?



Furthering its unification strategy with APUs, AMD will deploy Embedded+ architecture, which combines Versai AI chips with Ryzen CPUs. Such embedded chips are widely used in automation and robotics. AMD’s next-gen MI325X will feature 3 nm packaging with HBM3E memory, while AMD’s new Zen 5 CPUs (codenamed “Turin”) are rumored to feature up to 192 cores and 384 threads.



Nvidia’s next GPUs, the Blackwell series, will also feature a 3 nm node process owing to TSMC’s cutting-edge foundries. Per Commercial Times’ reporting, Nvidia’s H200 will use 4 nm while B100 adopts the 3 nm process. 



Based on these trends, Nvidia and AMD appear neck and neck in the tech arena. This mirrors the two companies’ history, where their products are comparable, but AMD caters to the mid-tier sector with competitive pricing. 



This time, Nvidia managed to grab and secure a bigger AI pie with its coordinated CUDA/GPU offering. 







Does Nvidia’s Overboughtness Matter?



Nvidia’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 102 in 2024 (fiscal), estimated to lower to 47 next year. AMD’s P/E was 84 last year, and it is estimated to grow to 64 next year. With P/E ratios for both companies suggesting strong investor confidence, Nvidia’s decreased P/E points to price correction and less risky earnings growth.



Analysts believe that both AMD and NVDA stocks are good picks for AI investment thesis despite AMD’s plunge in May following lower guidance than expected. Nasdaq’s forecasting data places AMD shares at $191 average price target vs current $163. Nvidia’s average price target is $187.76 vs current $120 per share. 



This gives Nvidia stock a 56% upside potential compared to AMD’s 17%. In other words, Nvidia’s stock split was the right move at the right time, further boosting investor confidence. 



Do you think Nvidia will keep up its momentum? Let us know in the comments below.

Top Crypto Exchange Binance Reaches 200,000,000 User Milestone - The Daily Hodl


								The world’s largest crypto exchange has reached a new milestone despite facing legal and regulatory battles.
In a post on social media platform X, Binance thanks members of its community for helping the crypto exchange achieve a global user base of over 200 million. 










“Today, we celebrate 200 million – and it’s all because of YOU!
Your support is the heartbeat of our journey to one billion users.”
Aside from growing its users to more than twice the population of Germany, Binance is also the leading crypto exchange in terms of liquidity, according to a new report from digital asset analytics firm Kaiko.
The analytics firm gets its liquidity ranking from a mix of the exchanges’ trading volume, share of volume, market depth, coefficient of variation dispersion score and market quality score.
Source: Kaiko
Binance’s milestone comes following several lawsuits and fines from multiple jurisdictions’ regulatory agencies.
Last month, Canada’s anti-money laundering agency reportedly imposed a nearly $4.4 million fine on the exchange for failing to register as a foreign money services business. In November, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao resigned as CEO following accusations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the company violated US federal laws.
And currently, Binance officials and some US lawmakers are urging the Nigerian government to release one of the company’s employees from prison after the country accused the crypto exchange of contributing to the fall of the Nigerian naira. 
Shortly after he took over as CEO, Zhao’s successor, Richard Teng, said that the exchange would move towards better compliance in a bid to claim a bigger share of the growing crypto market.

Ethereum-based Lending Protocol Uwulend Suffers $20 Million Exploit - The Defiant

The attack involved three transactions that converted Wrapped Bitcoin and DAI into ETH.Ethereum-based lending protocol Uwulend has been exploited to the tune of $20 million.Cyvers Alerts detected the malicious behavior early Monday morning. An attacker executed three transactions that converted WBTC and DAI into Ether.The Uwulend team informed their users via X that the platform has been paused while they investigate the situation.The wallet address linked to the Uwulend exploiter holds a whopping 1,282 ETH or $4.7 million.Notably, the UWU token didn’t react violently to the news. UWU dropped 3% to $2.91, which only adds to its overall downtrend. Over the past year, the token has shed 80% of its value and showcases a $26 million market capitalization, as per data from CoinGecko.UWU PriceCyvers Alerts team members told The Defiant that the attacker funded today’s exploit with assets withdrawn from cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash two days ago.They also explained that the hack took place due to an issue with a price oracle across five different tokens. “Specifically, the sUSDe asset's value is determined using a median from several sources,” Cyvers Alerts said. During the hack, five of these sources—FRAXUSDe, USDeUSDC, USDeDAI, USDecrvUSD, and GHOUSDe were manipulated.Uwulend touts itself as a decentralized non-custodial liquidity market protocol, and its website shows that the protocol has generated more than $9.3 million in fees. According to DefiLlama, it has $66 million in total value locked (TVL), which represents a near 50% drop from its late April peak of $115 million.The protocol was created by Sifu, the controversial co-founder of the now-defunct crypto exchange QuadrigaX. QuadrigaX is a Canadian company that went under in 2019 after mysteriously losing $190 million in customer funds.Sifu is yet to make any public announcement regarding Uwulend’s exploit.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsJust a whisker away from an all-time high price, Apple's stock has been soaring for the past seven weeks—a remarkable turnaround from the 13-week bearish correction that saw the tech giant lose nearly 17% of its value.The last time Apple embarked on a similar streak was back in October 2023, when it reached a record-breaking $199.11. With the current price at $195, the tech titan is just a little over 2% away from entering a new price discovery zone.Market indicators are looking robust for the long-term trend, with prices comfortably below the EMA10, and a bullish sentiment evident among traders, as shown by a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 62 points—meaning that 62% of traders want to buy the stock.However, those playing the short-term game should tread carefully, as some speculators might be tempted to sell the news and the bullish trend. The Average Directional Index (ADX), which measures the strength of a trend, is currently at a lowly 21 points, hinting at a possible rank or an equilibrium phase before a new surge, or perhaps a much-needed bearish correction.Image: TradingviewWhat's behind this sudden price spike? It's all about the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) and the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event that begins Monday, which has been aptly dubbed "Apple Intelligence." The hype around AI has been the driving force behind the recent market rally in the tech sector worldwide, with new models and hardware being released faster than ever.Analysts expect the company to place a significant emphasis on its AI strategy at the WWDC event, which could include updates on Siri, AI-enabled features in apps, and potential partnerships with OpenAI. If so, it would be a long-awaited response to the competition.For example, Google announced its new Pixel smartphone lineup with new AI-focused Tensor chips. This upgraded hardware is powerful enough to run its Gemini model locally, as well as power generative AI features. Other brands like Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola etc are either focusing on bringing AI features with cloud computing or leveraging the power of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 which are all about on-device AI as well.The integration of AI technology into the Apple ecosystem is expected to bring "ample monetization" opportunities according to stock analyst Daniel Ives, which could add a tidy $30 to $40 per share to the company's growth story. Some analysts are even predicting a potential 30-40% upside from the current price, following the AI-related announcements at the event.The AI craze has led to a shift in focus for many tech giants, including Meta, Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Google, and Microsoft, who are all eager to cash in on this burgeoning technology. Nvidia has even overtaken Apple as the world's second most valuable company, thanks to its growth in the AI sector, which has also helped spike the S&P 500 index.The WWDC event will be livestreamed on Apple’s official site and YouTube channel on June 10 at 1pm ET.Edited by Andrew HaywardGenerally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

MiCA could propel euro-backed stablecoins in the Eurozone: Kaiko report - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Impending Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations are poised to transform the stablecoin landscape favorably to euro-backed stablecoins, as reported by Kaiko Research. Binance has announced restrictions on stablecoins that fall short of the new MiCA standards, while Kraken is assessing its stablecoin offerings to ensure compliance with the European Union’s criteria, which may result in the delisting of certain stablecoins for EU customers.Despite Europe’s slower adoption rate compared to the US and APAC regions, euro-backed stablecoins have seen a surge in trading volume since the year’s start. This uptick indicates a growing demand within European markets. Notably, the combined weekly volume of prominent euro stablecoins, including Tether’s EURT, Stasis EURS, and Circle’s EURCV, has surpassed $40 million since March, marking a record duration of sustained high volume.AEUR, introduced by Binance in December, has quickly dominated the euro stablecoin sector, accounting for over half of the total volume. While USD-backed stablecoins remain the market’s giants, with a staggering $270 billion in average weekly volume in 2024, euro-backed stablecoins have carved out a 1.1% transaction share, a significant rise from virtually none in 2020.Image: KaikoTrading pairs of USDT against the euro are now some of the most traded instruments, outpacing even EUR-denominated Bitcoin trading on Binance and Kraken. This trend highlights these platforms’ role as key fiat gateways for European traders.The specific stablecoins to be deemed unauthorized remain undisclosed. However, Kraken’s review of Tether’s USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, is particularly noteworthy given its past regulatory challenges. Despite its primary trade volume occurring during US market hours, USDT remains a vital asset for European traders.While over-the-counter (OTC) trading will likely maintain USDT-EUR liquidity, the shift towards regulated alternatives such as USDC could become a preferred option for many traders, suggests the report.

Paul Krugman Debunks Fears: Why the $34 Trillion U.S. Debt Isn't Doomsday | Cryptoglobe


                                
Paul Krugman highlights the significant national debt of $34 trillion in his latest opinion piece for The New York Times (NYT), emphasizing that while it appears daunting, the historical and international context diminishes its perceived threat. 



Paul Krugman is a renowned American economist and public intellectual, known for his influential work in international economics and trade theory. Born on 28 February 1953, he earned his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1977. Krugman’s academic contributions, particularly his analysis of economic geography and trade patterns, earned him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008. 



Beyond academia, Krugman has been a prolific writer and commentator, authoring numerous books and over 20 years of columns for The New York Times. His writing often tackles contemporary economic issues, advocating for progressive policies and critiquing austerity measures. Krugman’s clear and often provocative commentary has made him a significant voice in public economic discourse. Throughout his career, he has held prestigious academic positions and has been a visiting professor at several universities, including Princeton, where he is a professor emeritus.



In an NYT article published on June 6, Krugman explains that the $34 trillion figure, although substantial, is less alarming when considered as a percentage of GDP, comparable to levels seen at the end of World War II in the U.S. and much lower than historical debt levels in countries like Japan and Britain.



Krugman asserts that most historical debt crises involved countries borrowing in foreign currencies, which left them vulnerable to liquidity crises. He cites the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s and the European debt crisis in 2010-12 as examples. These crises were mitigated by the ability to print money to stabilize the economy, a luxury the U.S. enjoys as it borrows in its own currency.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Krugman acknowledges a general unease about projections showing debt as a percentage of GDP rising over the next 30 years but argues that this is manageable. He notes that unlike individuals, governments do not need to pay off their debt entirely. Historical debt, such as that from World War II, was effectively reduced through economic growth and inflation, rather than direct repayment.



Krugman references research by Bobby Kogan and Jessica Vela from the Center for American Progress, indicating that stabilizing debt as a percentage of GDP would require increasing taxes or cutting spending by 2.1% of GDP. He contends that this is a relatively small adjustment, feasible without significant economic harm, given the U.S. collects a smaller percentage of GDP in taxes compared to other wealthy nations.



The political landscape, particularly Republican policies, poses the real challenge to addressing debt concerns, according to Krugman. He points out that Republicans often criticize debt while advocating for policies that exacerbate fiscal issues, such as extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts and reducing the IRS budget, hindering efforts to collect taxes from wealthy individuals.



Krugman concludes that America’s debt issues are more a reflection of political dysfunction than economic unsustainability. He emphasizes that with the right political will, the U.S. could easily address debt concerns, but the current political climate, especially the radicalization within the GOP, hampers meaningful progress. Krugman expresses greater concern for the implications of political dysfunction on democracy than for the national debt itself.

Inside Solana's Battle Against the Crypto 'Sandwich Attack' Menace


							

Mert Montaz highlighted that validators exploiting the Sandwich attack bug on Solana are disqualified from the Solana Foundation program.



The Solana Foundation will not support validators who misuse the platform for personal gain.



Montaz noted ongoing issues with MEV and network spamming by some RPC providers.




Helius CEO, Mert Montaz, recently addressed concerns on X (formerly Twitter) regarding the Solana Foundation Delegation program, following the disqualification of some validators for malpractice.







Montaz explained how a malicious bug, known as a Sandwich attack, can manipulate transactions, causing investors to lose funds while attackers profit. He emphasized that Solana’s lack of a mempool prevents such attacks natively. However, some validators have modified their software to facilitate these attacks on the platform.



Montaz clarified that while the Solana Foundation supports validators by delegating SOL tokens, it takes a strong stance against those who misuse the platform.




“Since people are abusing the system to rob retail and then keep the profits all for themselves — Solana Foundation is not interested in retail users being robbed, especially with their own stake,” 




Montaz added that the foundation will withhold token delegations from validators involved in Sandwich attacks. He emphasized that the disqualified validators, representing less than 16% of the total stake, can still operate independently. However, the foundation will not financially incentivize validators who exploit users.









Montaz highlighted the ongoing challenge of MEV on the Solana blockchain. He also pointed to the increasing issue of malicious RPC providers spamming the network with harmful code. However, he reassured users that Helius RPCs do not contribute to this problem and are actively developing an MEV-protected endpoint.




“There are some RPC providers who spam the hell out of the network, which makes this problem much worse than it should be, and then brag about landing rates. Helius RPCs do not do this, and while we don’t have a full  mev-protect endpoint yet, we do use swqos and have less fwds.”




Montaz concluded that future stake pools will likely adopt similar policies to discourage exploitative behavior and promote a fairer environment for retail investors.

Memecoin on Coinbase’s Base Chain Flips Solana’s BONK After Explosive 426% Rally - The Daily Hodl


								The biggest memecoin on the Base blockchain is working its way through the ranks, flipping Dogecoin (DOGE) rival BONK in terms of market cap early on Monday.
BRETT, a memecoin meant to accompany the frog-themed altcoin Pepe, is up 426% in the last 30 days at time of writing, trading at $0.18.










Pepe was originally inspired by the character in the Boys Club comic series created by Matt Furie. Also in the series was Pepe’s friend, Brett, a blue creature who likes dancing and fashion, and who the BRETT coin on Base is inspired by.
BRETT has a market cap of $1.796 billion, which was briefly bigger than BONK earlier today but has since dipped slightly below by about $71 million.
In total, BRETT is up 21,317% since February when it was trading below $0.0009.
In April, blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain spotted two wallets whitelisted by the coin’s developers that inked 30,830x gains, turning just over a hundred dollars into over $3 million.
Lookonchain notes that two wallets whitelisted by the deployer for the meme asset spent 0.034 ETH, worth $102, to buy a combined 172.56 million BRETT in February.
Those wallets subsequently sold 122.74 million BRETT for 890.65 ETH worth $3.14 million on-chain via multiple wallets, printing staggering gains to the tune of 30,830x.
Whitelisted wallets are approved participants for a specific crypto event like an initial coin offering (ICO), according to Coinbase. The pseudonymous crypto analyst known as Shady says the Brett deployer whitelisted 139 addresses.

First Data Arrived from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Approved in the UK! - Bitcoin Sistemi

ETFs backed by Bitcoin and Ethereum in the UK have seen low trading volumes since their launch on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) on May 28. The launch took place following the approval of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
Unlike their US counterparts, these products can only be traded by professional investors. But 21Shares, one of the issuers of these ETFs, believes that opening up these products to the retail market could be a “game changer”.


21Shares offers eight cross-listed products in the UK, four powered by Bitcoin and four powered by Ethereum. WisdomTree manages four ETFs, two each for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), while Invesco offers two Bitcoin-backed products. To list on the LSE, crypto ETFs must be physically backed, unleveraged and offer exposure only to Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Since their launch, the total volume of all these products was just $504,880 as of June 6. WisdomTree accounts for 59% of transaction volume, while 21Shares accounts for 41%. In contrast, Invesco's products have seen zero transaction volume so far. By comparison, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US saw $2.5 billion worth of trading volume in a single day on Friday.





Among 21Shares' products, Ethereum offerings were more successful, accounting for 76% of transaction volumes. Within this, 21Shares' Ethereum Staking ETFs saw approximately 57% more trading volume than the Core Ethereum product without staking returns.
21Shares noted that professional investors typically trade over-the-counter (OTC), buying and selling financial instruments outside of official exchanges such as the LSE, directly with another party or through the most liquid exchange available.

Bitcoin Risk Of Sell-Off Drops Sharply As Short-Term Holder Profit Remains Low | Bitcoinist.com


								Over the weekend, Bitcoin suffered from mounting sell pressure that pushed the price below $70,000 once again. However, with the short-term hold profitability remaining low at this time, the risk of the pioneer cryptocurrency suffering further sell-offs has dropped significantly.
Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Profitability At 3.35%
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has soothed Bitcoin investors’ nerves with new data that shows a reduced risk of sell-off. The chart which was posted in the early hours of Monday shows that Bitcoin short-term holder profitability has remained low going into the new week.

According to Martinez, the low profitability, which is currently sitting at just 3.35%, means that there is a minimal risk of sell-off at this time. This is because short-term investors are likely to wait for higher profit margins before they start selling off their holdings for profit.
The chart shows that in the last few weeks, the Bitcoin short-term holder profitability has fluctuated wildly, as the Bitcoin price has struggled to find its footing. However, looking at the profitability over a longer period of time, and it seems that short-term holders have done quite well for themselves.


Compared to where the short-term holder profitability was at the start of the month of June, these investors are seeing positive upside as of recently. However, compared to previous sell trends, the profitability will have to increase for these short-term investors to begin selling once again.
Can BTC Surge From Here?
In a previous analysis of the Bitcoin price, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has mapped out where he expects the BTC price to go from here. The analysis showed the cryptocurrency’s movements over the last year with various corrections and peaks.
Going by this data, the crypto analyst believes that the next local top for the Bitcoin price could lie around the $89,200 level. From the current price of around $69,400, this would be a 28% increase in price, and a new all-time high for the digital asset.

Additionally, another post by the analyst shows that the Taker Buy Sell Ratio on the HTX Global Exchange rose as high as 730. What this means is that there is a lot of bullish sentiment toward the cryptocurrency and the analyst believes that this could drive the next rally.
For now, the Bitcoin price continues to struggle amid mounting pressure from bears. After reaching $71,000 last week, the price has since retraced most of its gains. Currently trading at $69,429 at the time of writing, it has seen a 0.45% increase in the last week. However, it remains the largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $1.368 trillion.

Solana Meme Coin Michi Pumps After Ariana Grande Shares the Cat's Photo - Decrypt

Solana meme coin Michi jumped 18% early Monday, according to data from CoinGecko, after pop artist Ariana Grande shared the meme that inspired the coin on her Instagram story. The Michi meme was edited to hold a pink “love potion,” alongside posters of a man adored with kiss prints on the wall. This is the work of a Grande fan account in reference to a music video the singer released for her single “The Boy Is Mine.”“I think the boy is hers, [I don’t know],” the post reads, followed by the image of the meme. “Hey it’s me,” a Michi Solana Instagram account commented. In the eight hours that followed Grande’s repost, Michi only moved up 3% to $0.22. But once pseudonymous crypto influencer Ansem—who previously helped propel hyped coins like Dogwifhat (WIF)—highlighted Grande’s repost on his Twitter, the chart spiked 18% to $0.26 in just an hour.This move comes after a number of celebrities have publicly announced their venture into crypto. Most notably, media personality Caitlyn Jenner launched two meme coins and musician Iggy Azalea debuted her own, while former kickboxer Andrew Tate set out on a meme coin spending spree late last week.It’s unlikely that this was part of a hack of the artist’s account, as she’s continued with her normal social media activity, including a happy birthday message to her mom.The move sparked debate on Crypto Twitter on whether or not the post happened organically. But many believe that this was simply an organic reposting of the meme. After all, Michi was a meme before it was a meme coin, and it's likely that most people sharing the image are unaware of its crypto connection.In turn, there’s a good chance that Grande has no idea that the meme coin exists, and that she instead just wanted to repost a fan-made meme promoting her freshly released music video.“The memes most of these coins are based on are already viral. If a celeb posts about said meme, it’s because it’s already viral. They’re not promoting the underlying meme coin,” a Twitter user explained. “It’s a great endorsement for the meme itself.”Decrypt reached out to Ariana Grande's team for clarification, but did not immediately receive a response.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Yes, now is the right time to teach Wall Street about decentralized oracles - Blockworks


When the NYSE went down this week — causing several erroneous trades based on bad pricing data — Blockworks’ Empire Newsletter responded to expert calls for the integration of blockchain technology with serious skepticism: 
“Wall Street just implemented the ability to settle trades in one business day versus two, and now we want to tell them about firms like Chainlink, which offer decentralized oracle networks. […] We have to be pragmatic.”
Sure, pragmatism is key, and Wall Street has historically been slow to embrace blockchain technology beyond speculation. But something has clearly shifted this year.
In 2023, when the industry was still recovering from the FTX collapse, Chainlink’s co-founder, Sergey Nazarov, surprised many at Sibos (Swift’s annual conference) by predicting that everyone at the conference would inevitably be compelled to join the blockchain industry. Fast forward to last week’s Consensus, one of the largest crypto conferences, and you saw more suits than ever before. 
While many pundits both within and outside the industry are still obsessing over dog memecoins, most seem to be missing the real trend: Institutional adoption is quietly but rapidly happening before our eyes. 
If we want crypto to merge with traditional industries and expand tenfold, we need Wall Street and capital markets to embrace it. And asset tokenization seems to be the key. While Wall Street moves at a slower pace compared to crypto startups, the idea that it can’t embrace new technology is outdated. The innovation divisions of the largest banks and asset managers are already advancing with tokenization experiments and proofs of concept, showing they can certainly understand decentralized oracles.
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, seems to agree. They began their foray into crypto this January with a record-breaking bitcoin ETF, now managing around $16.5 billion. Larry Fink recently said he sees tokenization as the next big opportunity in digital assets, sending a clear signal that tokenization is not just for the crypto industry. By March, BlackRock introduced its first tokenized fund and invested in crypto startup Securitize to create a money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain. This initiative has attracted $385 million and could generate up to $88 million in annual revenue. 
But BlackRock isn’t alone. Asset managers including Franklin Templeton, Hamilton Lane and WisdomTree have tokenized ’40 Act funds to enhance security and transaction speed. UBS launched a tokenized money market fund on Ethereum, while JPMorgan and Citi have also ventured into tokenization projects. Other institutions, including HSBC, Societe Generale and the European Investment Bank, have issued tokenized bonds. Even major payments networks Visa and Mastercard are exploring settling tokenized assets on a shared ledger. In 2023, Chainlink partnered with Swift and major banks to connect Swift’s system with blockchains like Ethereum, thus enabling secure cross-chain messaging. It also recently collaborated with DTCC to embed structured data onchain. Two years ago, such collaborations between large financial institutions and a blockchain company were unprecedented, and now they are a reality.
Read more from our opinion section: It’s time to end the SEC’s war on crypto
Two major elements have finally aligned for institutions to embrace crypto: Capital markets finally understand the financial incentives enabled by crypto (crypto significantly boosts transaction efficiency, saving asset managers millions), and the technology is reaching the point of production-readiness needed to enable mass asset tokenization.
We see proof of these trends in our daily work with the largest banks and asset managers. Over the past year alone, the Chainlink Labs team has engaged globally with dozens of institutions across the global financial industry. This isn’t 2016 or 2017, when blockchain was merely a side focus for a few oddballs in the innovation wings of massive financial firms. Today, the traditional finance and capital markets industry is not just experimenting; it is making real strategic moves to integrate blockchain technology into its tech stack.
As for the NYSE glitch…imagine a system where trading halts due to technical issues are minimized, and market stability is maintained through automated checks and balances. This world is becoming a reality because the technology needed to solve these issues is here.

Chris Barrett serves as the Director of Communications at Chainlink Labs and has been involved with Chainlink since 2017. Chainlink is the only on-chain data and cross-chain platform that enables financial institutions to develop customized, flexible, compliant, and future-proof blockchain applications and tokenized assets. Before this role, he founded a leading PR agency for technology startups, where he worked with over 1,000 innovative companies. Chris is also an avid runner, having maintained a streak of running for over five consecutive years.

Cardano (ADA) Dominating Social Media Discussions


According to data provided by cryptocurrency analytics firm Santiment, Cardano (ADA) and Bitcoin (BTC) are in the lead when it comes to social media engagement.As reported by U.Today, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson announced that the proof-of-stake network was on the verge of the Chang hard fork. The aforementioned hard fork is shaping up to be the most significant update both for Cardano itself and the broader industry, according to Hoskinson.During the "Voltaire" phase of the roadmap, Cardano will implement a new governance model that will put the community in charge. Hoskinson is convinced that Cardano will have the most advanced governance system among all blockchains. His bullish post ignited strong social media engagement, with most social media users expressing bullish sentiment. However, this buzz has not translated into any meaningful gains for ADA. Cardano's native token is up only a mere 0.5% over the past 24 hours. It remains in 11th place with a market capitalization of $15.6 billion. In the meantime, Bitcoin is being discussed precisely due to its recent price action. Last week, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap failed to top the $72,000 level last week due to strong jobs data. At press time, it is changing hands at $69,920, with bulls and bears battling for the pivotal $70,000 level. The flagship cryptocurrency also generated some social media buzz after scoring its second-highest weekly close to date. Social media users are also frequently comparing Bitcoin's market cap to major companies such as Apple, according to Santiment.

Arthur Hayes: Bitcoin 'Trend Is Clear, Central Banks Are Starting Easing Cycles' - Benzinga

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes offered in his latest blog post a provocative view on global economic maneuvers and their potential impacts for crypto investors.What Happened: In “Group of Fools,” Hayes argues that the dollar-yen exchange rate is the most critical macroeconomic indicator. Instead of his earlier idea of strengthening the yen, he now observes that the central banking “charlatans” of the Group of Seven (G7) are working to convince the market that the interest rate differential between the yen and other major currencies will narrow."The problem is the weak yen," he asserts, noting that if the yen isn't strengthened, China might devalue its yuan to compete, potentially destabilizing U.S. Treasuries and threatening the Pax Americana-led financial system.Central banks’ beginning easing cycles led Hayes to revise his strategy. He sees these conditions as catalytic for a crypto bull market. "Exit the Choppa Zone," he writes, indicating that the June rate cuts by the BOC and ECB will jolt the crypto market out of its summer doldrums.Hayes emphatically suggests going long on Bitcoin BTC/USD and altcoins. "The trend is clear. Central banks at the margin are starting easing cycles," he states, adding that it's time for projects in his Maelstrom portfolio to launch their tokens now, seizing the favorable market conditions.Also Read: Arthur Hayes: ‘Major Economies To Print Even More Money’ In The Next 24 MonthsWhy It Matters: Hayes's analysis highlighted significant intersections between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency market. His predictions indicate that ongoing central bank policies could rejuvenate the crypto bull market, providing substantial opportunities for investors.In an interview over the weekend, Hayes again emphasized taking a "long" position however added on a light-hearted note, "Don’t sell, don’t get shook, don’t use too much leverage, I mean it’s pretty simple like everyone knows what they should be doing."In a late May blog post, Hayes argued that policymakers, both elected and unelected, often prefer short-term solutions, or the “easy button,” to maintain power and avoid hard choices.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Arthur Hayes Outlines Crypto Trading Strategies For 2024 Bull Market: ‘It’s Pretty Simple’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Hedge Funds Heavily Betting For Bitcoin To Fall: Will This Strategy Fail?


																Looking at the formation in the daily chart, there is no relief for Bitcoin at spot rates. Following the flash crash on June 6, prices reversed sharply from the $72,000 level, further highlighting the significance of the liquidation level. 
In the past, Bitcoin prices have recoiled from this level, with analysts expecting a short squeeze to print once this line is breached.
Hedge Funds Are Short Selling Bitcoin Futures: Will This Strategy Backfire?
Amid this slip, one analyst on X notes that hedge funds and Wall Street firms have increasingly taken short positions on Bitcoin futures contracts, expecting BTC prices to plunge. 
Though they could be net long on the spot market, taking advantage of the fee differential, the trader notes that this strategy is risky. If anything, massive losses could occur should prices unexpectedly spike. 
Between the current price point and slightly above all-time highs at $74,000, exchange data and trader notes show $12 billion worth of short positions on BTC futures. 
Hedge funds selling BTC | Source: @olvelez007 via X
This move means that hedge funds are net bearish, and since everyone knows the big boys of Wall Street are shorting, this move could backfire spectacularly.  
Even so, hedge funds selling BTC futures are nothing new. Often, hedge funds tend to short the futures of a given product and simultaneously buy the spot markets, taking advantage of the carry trade to profit. 

	Related Reading


The problem is that this hedging tactic is popular in traditional finance and has been profitable before. On the other hand, Bitcoin is a new asset class that is outside the traditional finance system. 
Accordingly, the strategy might not pan out exactly as expected, leading to massive losses.
BTC Fragile But Spot ETF Issuers On A Buying Spree
Whether Bitcoin will recover from spot rates remains to be seen. As it is, BTC is under immense selling pressure, dropping from $72,000. 
Bitcoin price trending sideways on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView
Although the uptrend remains, buyers are yet to reverse the June 6 losses, meaning the path of least resistance in the short term is southwards. A break below $66,000 would completely wipe out gains of May 20, signaling a trend shift.

Still, buyers are upbeat about what lies ahead. Last week, despite the contraction, all spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers in the United States have been on a buying spree. 
Spot BTC ETF issuers buying | Source: @HODL15Capital via X
According to HODL15 Capital, in the first week of June, they added 25,729 Bitcoin. This stash is equivalent to roughly two months’ worth of mined coins and is the highest weekly buying activity since mid-March. Then, BTC rose to all-time highs of around $73,800.

Ripple Eyes Institutional Market with USD-Backed Stablecoin


							

Targets regulated markets and expands XRP Ledger utility.



Stablecoin aims to connect traditional finance with digital currencies.



Increased traffic to XRP Ledger expected to benefit the proposed stablecoin.




Ripple is poised to launch a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, aiming to enhance liquidity and expand utility across its XRP Ledger and Ethereum platforms. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Middle East and Africa Managing Director, confirmed this strategic move despite ongoing legal battles with the SEC. This stablecoin promises to bolster Ripple’s offerings in regulated markets and foster a more robust infrastructure for both institutional and decentralized finance.







This launch marks a significant milestone for Ripple, representing its latest effort to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and the evolving digital currency space. By deploying the stablecoin on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, Ripple seeks to improve its existing payment solutions and attract businesses seeking compliant entry points into crypto.



The introduction of the stablecoin goes beyond expanding Ripple’s infrastructure. It’s also a response to the expanding stablecoin market, currently valued at $150 billion and projected to reach $2.8 trillion to $3 trillion by 2028.










The stablecoin is expected to have a significant impact on international trade, particularly in regions like the Middle East, where many non-U.S. dollar transactions occur. Merrick emphasized the need for a reliable, legally compliant digital currency to facilitate these transactions efficiently, minimizing price fluctuation risks.



Technically, the Ripple stablecoin will leverage the XRP Ledger’s features, including the DeFi and Automated Market Maker (AMM), to enhance trading, and provide new opportunities for developers building financial applications. Additionally, it aims to drive more traffic and transactions to the XRP Ledger, ultimately boosting XRP’s usage in the financial market.

Bitcoin is set to reach as high as $350k by the 25th of August this year, according to the author of the New York Times bestseller Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Robert Kiyosaki, a PhD economist in question, is a known Bitcoin bull and has made bold predictions in the past regarding the digital currency.



Kiyosaki posted on X:







While Kiyosaki did tweet that the premier digital currency will reach $350k in about two and a half months, he followed up with a more realistic take by saying it is only a prediction, not a lie. He also stated that he is going to keep buying more Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana because he is certain their prices will continue to rise as well.



Are Kiyosaki’s Predictions Reliable?



Kiyosaki then followed up with vitriol against the President, Fed chairman Gary Powell, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. He is known to be critical of the US government’s irresponsible fiscal policies, and he prefers BTC because of its declared scarcity.



However, just a couple of months ago, Kiyosaki tweeted a prediction that the digital currency would reach as high as $100k by the end of June. We are already a week into the new month, and the index is currently stuck just above $70k. Even a new All-Time High (ATH) has been elusive. It is still achievable but getting tougher with each passing day, and there is no clear price uptick.

Bitcoin to $350k in 80 Days?



Bitcoin has a lot of ground to cover to reach the massive $350k valuation by August 25 of this year. The index will need to appreciate roughly 500% to achieve this milestone, and the total market capitalization will cross the $6 trillion valuation in the process.



Theoretically, 5x moves in the premier digital currency have happened before but not in such a short time since 8 years. So, Kiyosaki’s prediction of a $350k Bitcoin in such a short amount of time is quite unrealistic overall. While it may be possible at the end of the current bull market, it certainly has little chance by August.



However, his June prediction of $100k is still in the books and the end of this month is highly anticipated as it would set the tone for the second half of the calendar year. Bulls would be looking to record a new ATH even if the $100k price target isn’t achieved.

A Cryptocurrency Exchange Stops Trading: Users Cannot Withdraw Their Assets - Bitcoin Sistemi

Lykke, a UK-based crypto exchange, announced that it suspended trading on June 6 due to “unauthorized access” to its platform.
The suspension comes two days after the exchange's security breach, as first reported by web researcher SomaXBT. MetaMask developer and crypto defense expert Taylor Monahan also states that the exchange suffered a loss of $ 22 million from suspicious outflows.


Lykke, which recorded $2.5 million in cumulative volume last month, is currently preventing its users from withdrawing their assets from the platform. A few users reported missing account balances, indicating a potential hack.
Approximately half of the stolen amount is in Bitcoin, and the rest consists of Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, according to onchain data. The data also reveals that ETH withdrawn from the exchange was immediately converted into the DAI stablecoin issued by MakerDAO.





At the same time, the seized Bitcoin was distributed to multiple wallets; This is a typical strategy used by hackers to hide the transaction trail during money laundering.
The stock market remained largely silent about the incident. On June 6, Lykke CEO Richard Olsen apologized for the platform's downtime in an email to customers.



“We are still investigating the causes of this security incident,” Olsen said in the email. He reassured customers that their funds were safe and said “Lykke is a diversified business with strong capital reserves.”
The exchange's website currently displays a message stating that the platform is “under maintenance following security” and “will not be active until further notice.”





This is the second crypto exchange attack in the last two weeks, following the theft of $320 million from the DMM Bitcoin platform on May 31.

Solana vs. Ethereum Feud Intensifies with Validator Ouster


								The Solana Foundation has expelled a number of validator operators from its influential delegation program. This action is attributed to their involvement in executing “sandwich attacks” against unsuspecting network users, a form of predatory trading that undermines network integrity. The decision adds a new layer to the escalating rivalry between Solana and Ethereum, highlighting broader concerns over network governance and the ethical dimensions of validator operations.
Tim Garcia, the Validator Relations Lead, made the announcement via Discord, emphasizing the finality of the Foundation’s decision: “A group of operators in the Solana Foundation Delegation Program have been removed from the program due to violations […] Decisions in this matter are final. Enforcement actions are ongoing as we detect operators participating in mempools which allow sandwich attacks.”
Mert Mumtaz, founder and CEO of Helius Labs, provided a detailed explanation of the issues at hand. He described a sandwich attack as a manipulative trading strategy where malicious actors exploit the ordering of transactions to disadvantage retail investors, ensuring they receive the worst possible prices.

“This is not natively possible on Solana because the client does not have a mempool,” Mumtaz explained. “Certain actors have added mods to their validators to enable sandwiching on Solana.” He stressed that the SOL Foundation’s primary goal is to protect retail users from these attacks, reinforcing that while the ousted operators can still function on the network, they will no longer benefit from Foundation subsidies.
Solana Vs. Ethereum Rivalry Heats Up
The incident has drawn sharp criticism from Ethereum community stalwarts, including Ryan Berckmans, an esteemed investor known as ryanb.eth. He critiqued SOL’s approach to solving issues related to MEV, questioning the network’s seriousness as a settlement layer.
“The Solana Foundation provides financial support to many validators because running a Sol validator costs $65k+/year. Now, the next step in their plan to solve MEV was to pull financial support from validators who extract MEV. Solana is not a serious settlement layer,” Berckmans asserted.
Countering Berckmans’ criticisms, Mumtaz highlighted the financial and operational disparities between Solana and Ethereum validators. “You haven’t done the work required to have an informed opinion,” Mumtaz retorted, pointing out that while Solana validators have lower setup costs compared to Ethereum’s 32 ETH minimum stake requirement.
“Perhaps you’re forgetting that with the 32 ETH minimum, it costs ~120kfor Eth, double Solana — *and* while SOL validator revenue has surpassed Eth multiple times in the past month. this isn’t pulling “support from validators doing mev,” he stated and clarified that the SOL Foundation is “simply not giving out subsidies to malicious validators who sandwich, who rob retail and then keep all the rewards with 0 network/in-protocol distribution—it’s purely extractive.”

Furthering the dialogue, Lucas Bruder, CEO of Jito Labs, defended the Foundation’s position, emphasizing the alignment of interests between the Foundation and the broader network. “The Solana foundation is a staker on the network. Stakers should want to see the network be successful. Why would they support something that decreases the likelihood of the network being successful?” he posited.
However, Bruder also acknowledged the predominant nature of memecoin trading and the potential risks of alienating this user base. “Most activity on Solana is memecoin trading, so if you screw over the main user base of the blockspace, they’ll leave and we’ll all be sitting here with less usage wondering why tf we didn’t do anything,” he argued, stressing the need for long-term solutions to network challenges.
Ryan Berckmans doubled down on his critique, stating: “So if the Solana Foundation doesn’t use their centralized power to incentivize validators to stop extracting max MEV, then memecoin traders may get fed up and switch to a fast cheap chain with less potential for MEV extraction, like the Base Ethereum L2, and then Solana would be a ghost chain. I think this story writes itself. The SOL/ETH ratio vastly overstates Solana’s durability as a serious competitor to either the Eth L1 or our best L2s.”
This ongoing debate underscores the heated rivalry between SOL and ETH as well as the complexity of governance in decentralized networks, the technical challenges associated with MEV, and the strategic decisions that can significantly impact the perceptions and functionality of blockchain ecosystems.
At press time, SOL traded at $158.03.

What Andrew Tate's 'crypto insanity' has to do with Vitalik Buterin - AMBCrypto



Andrew Tate stirred a crypto storm over the weekend and flipped it into donation calls. 
His calls echoed with Vitalik Buterin’s vision for ‘better memecoins.’ 

After spiking a massive crypto storm over the weekend, social media influencer and former kickboxer Andrew Tate has nudged those who benefit from his shilling campaigns to donate for social good. 
‘Anyone who made money from my crypto insanity and wants good Karma can donate to Tate Pledge. Feeding starving children is always rewarded by god.’ 
So, what’s the “crypto insanity” that is he referencing? 
On Friday, Tate challenged his over 9 million X (formerly Twitter) followers that he would ‘own the crypto market’ if his post hit a certain number of retweets. Later on, the influencer posted another provocative post stating that, 
“I will crash the Solana network.”
Andrew Tate crypto frenzy felt in Solana
By ‘crash the Solana network,’ the former kickboxer meant shilling and buying the various memecoins in large volumes that could overwhelm the network. 
One of the memecoins the influencer promoted was Real Ni**er Tate [RNT]. As of press time, the token traded at $0.041, up 4% on the daily chart. 
However, over the weekend, the token hit a massive $170 million in trading volume. 
Another meme linked to Tate, TOPG, also hit a record trading volume of $238 million on the 8th of June, Coingecko data revealed. 
Reportedly, the TOPG developer offered Tate over 50% of the token’s supply, which the influencer later burned to pump up the tokens. 
Later on, the influencer stated that he made zero but turned people into millionaires on Solana. 
‘I’ve made over 100M trade through Solana, and I’ve turned people into millionaires. I’ve made zero. Zero. I just bought coins and held them to dust. I will make zero money because I am a real n*gger’ 
From crypto promotion to social good?
However, on Monday, the influencers called on those who benefited from his crypto shilling to donate part of the gains to the social good that he champions. 
Interestingly, Tate’s vision echoed with recent Vitalik Buterin’s recent arguments about celebrity involvement in the memecoin. 
Notably, Buterin had called for celebrity coins for social good as opposed to financial gains. 
“I’m feeling quite unhappy about with ‘this cycle’s celebrity experimentation’ so far.
However, other celebrities like Australian Iggy Azalea have taken the ‘financial path’ with her Mother Iggy [MOTHER] token.

Arthur Hayes Predicts Dogecoin Will Get An ETF This Cycle


																Regulators will inevitably approve a Dogecoin ETF after both Bitcoin and Ethereum hit US public markets, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.
During a Sunday interview alongside Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, the two investors reviewed their favorite meme coin and crypto picks this cycle, as well as the top risks currently looming over the industry.
Why Memecoins Will Keep WInning: Arthur Hayes
According to Hayes, meme coins still have plenty of runway this cycle, with the market bound to get “even crazier” as the Federal Reserve and US Treasury print more and more money.
“For the person who has just been initiated into crypto, it’s literally the easiest thing to understand,” said Hayes. “I don’t need to understand blockchain, and AI, and crypto, and cryptography.”
In a blog post last week, Hayes argued that the time had come to “go long Bitcoin and subsequently shitcoins,” in response to back-to-back interest rate cuts by both the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank. Historically speaking, low interest-rate environments bode well for stocks and Bitcoin, which causes capital to spill over into the riskier, more volatile memecoin market.




Both Hayes and Pal said they’ve got parts of their portfolio locked up in dog-themed coins including Dogecoin (DOGE), BONK, and dogwifhat (WIF).
The investors also agreed that Dogecoin would receive ETF approval in the United States by the end of the current bull market cycle.
“It’s the oldest memecoin, it’s on Robinhood,” said Hayes. “If you’re thinking about Tradfi getting into crypto and they’re gonna put an ETF on anything they can, it’s a high market cap thing. “
Dogecoin is currently up 136% over the past year. Since launching in December, WIF has mooned by nearly 1600%.
Trends To Watch This Cycle
Regarding other cryptos, Pal said he’s “ninety percent” into Solana, calling it “the right bet to have.” By contrast, Hayes said he predicts that Aptos – the 27th-ranked crypto by market cap size – to flip Solana “in the layer 1 game” within the next 1 to 3 years.
In terms of what to avoid, both men agreed that Cardano is a “narrative of the last cycle,” with Pal also taking a stab at Ripple (XRP).
The men also had similar worries about what could pose major risks to crypto during this cycle.
Both highlighted large centralized venues that control massive sections of the crypto market. Pal expressed concern over Derebit’s 90% market dominance in the options market, while Hayes argued that Coinbase and various banks – which control the Bitcoin backing the world’s largest Bitcoin ETFs – could lose customers a lot of money.
“If I’m gonna hack crypto, I’m going after one of these US custodians – one of these banks,” Hayes said. “Never have they had to custody an asset where if they lose it they can’t call up the Treasury or the Fed and get another bailout.”

SocialFi Application Friend.tech Leaving Base Blockchain in Move To Develop Own Network - The Daily Hodl


								SocialFi application protocol Friend.tech (FRIEND) says it’s leaving Coinbase’s Base chain to develop its own network.
In a new thread, the team behind the social finance platform says that it will be partnering up with Conduit, a firm that provides Ethereum (ETH) rollups, to work on Friendchain, its very own blockchain that will utilize FRIEND as its gas token.










“We’re pleased to be working with Conduit on Friendchain, our own blockchain that uses FRIEND as a fully transferable gas token. We’ll keep you up-to-date with all the info you need over the coming months as we build out this exciting new chapter.”
According to Friend.tech, users can sign up for the upcoming Friendchain testnet, but no specific date was mentioned for its launch.
Friend.tech, which launched in 2023, allows users to link their X accounts to a crypto wallet address, creating a social decentralized finance (DeFi) space where fans and creators can directly engage with one another.
“[Friend.tech] allows users to have a direct engagement with creators, which might not be possible in common channels. For example, a basketball fan can buy [NBA player] Grayson Allen’s Key to have a conversation with him. Another feature is it allows the resale value of the membership. Users can bet on the growth of the profiles or creators by buying their keys.” 
Data from market intelligence firm Dune Analytics reveals that Friend.tech has nearly $9 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) and just over 916,800 users who have completed at least one trade on the platform.
FRIEND is trading for $0.791 at time of writing, a nearly 20% decrease during the last 24 hours.

GameStop Dumps 15% as Roaring Kitty Jokes About His Plunging Position - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe meme stock influencer Keith Gill, better known as Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue, took an online jab at himself on Monday over the plummeting value of his GameStop holdings.“You were a billionaire,” a meme image he posted to Twitter (aka X) read, showing an illustration of a man pointing intently at himself in the reflection of a mirror.Meanwhile, GameStop shares have fallen 15% on the trading day to about $24, showing a 63% decrease relative to their peak price of $64.75 last week. Previously, amid Gill’s online return, shares in the video game retailer had spiked as high as $64.83 around mid-May.Gill’s overall attitude was upbeat Friday as the influencer sipped beer and livestreamed to over 700,000 viewers on YouTube for the first time in years. That was despite a steep drop in GameStop’s share price, which at the time had netted the influencer $235 million in daily losses on paper for the purported holdings he showed on-screen.“It is what it is. What am I going to do?” he said before the online crowd that had gathered to watch him riff on GameStop and witness his disclaimer-laden investment thesis.Previously posting screenshots of his E*Trade account on Reddit, Gill at one point held a mix of GameStop shares and call options worth $586 million. As of his latest “YOLO update,” the influencer was pushing paper gains of $382 million last week.Several prominent Twitter accounts in the finance space speculated that Gill was on target to becoming a billionaire as GameStop recently soared, including Unusual Whales. That was if the stock’s price could hold above the $65 mark before Gill’s stream, the account stated last Thursday.The announcement of Gill’s livestream sparked a sharp increase in GameStop’s stock price, but the rally was short-lived. By the time Gill appeared on his livestream Friday, the stock’s price had slipped over 30% from its previous closing price.Gill became the de facto face of a retail-led movement to bet big on Wall Street short sellers through GameStop in 2021. And it wasn’t until the influencer started posting again on Twitter last month that interest in the video game retailer’s shares was broadly reignited.As of this writing, GameStop shares have fallen 8% over the past five trading days from $26.19. Still, the stock’s value has increased 38% compared to around when Gill started posting online again in mid-May.While Gill’s Reddit account remains untouched since showing gains last week, the influencer’s Twitter activity has continued apace. Posting an image of a green Uno card a week prior, Gill shared a screenshot from the opening of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight” late Sunday—but with a cat mask swapped in.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Crypto ETPs See $2,000,000,000 in Inflows Amid Anticipation of Rate Cuts: CoinShares - The Daily Hodl


								Digital assets manager CoinShares says institutions poured two billion dollars into crypto products last week alone.
In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, CoinShares says digital asset investment products reached $2 billion last week, equaling the totals from the four weeks prior.










“Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling US $2bn, bringing this recent five-week run of inflows to US$4.3bn. Trading volumes in ETPs rose to US$12.8bn for the week, 55% up from the week prior. Unusually, inflows were seen across almost all providers, with a continued slowdown in outflows from incumbents. We believe this turnaround in sentiment is a direct response to weaker than expected macro data in the US, bringing forward monetary policy rate cut expectations.”
Source: CoinShares
Regionally, the United States raked in nearly $2 billion in inflows alone, seeing the record third-largest daily inflow records on the first day of the period.
The largest crypto by market cap, Bitcoin (BTC), per usual, took the lion’s share of the inflows at $1.97 billion.
“… while short-bitcoin saw outflows for the 3rd week in a row totaling US$5.3m.”
Ethereum (ETH) led all altcoins with $69 million in inflows. XRP, Chainlink (LINK), Solana (SOL) and BNB brought in $1.2 million, $0.7 million, $0.7 million, $0.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

DePin News: io.net CEO Leaves, Helium Mobile Grows, and More


Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePin) are transforming the tech landscape by enabling decentralized projects in real-world infrastructure.
Here’s what happened recently in the DePin sector: io.net’s CEO stepped down just before their token launch, Helium Mobile reached over 92,000 subscribers, and the number of active decentralized physical infrastructure projects grew to more than 1,200.
CEO of io.net Steps Down
Solana-based decentralized infrastructure provider io.net, which allows users to monetize their GPU power, has recently replaced its CEO just two days before the launch of its native token on Binance Launchpad. The token launch, scheduled for Tuesday, June 11, is part of io.net’s ambitious plans to become the world’s largest AI computing network. Co-founder Ahmad Shadid stepped down immediately, and fellow co-founder and former COO Tory Green stepped in as his successor.

In an effort to address speculation about his departure, Shadid has provided an explanation for his decision. He stresses that the firm remains committed to growth and success, and his departure aligns with this vision. 

“While there have been allegations regarding my past, I want to emphasize that I am stepping down as CEO to allow io.net to move forward without distraction and to focus on its growth and success,” Shadid said.

Io.net aggregates GPU resources to create a network offering machine learning startups affordable computing power, significantly reducing costs compared to traditional cloud services. However, io.net has faced heavy criticism. 
Observers argue that io.net misled the community about its GPU capabilities and question why it sets prices instead of allowing compute owners to do so. Furthermore, a GPU metadata attack on April 28 caused active GPU connections to plummet from 600,000 to 10,000, exacerbating concerns about the network’s reliability and transparency.
Helium Mobile Crosses 92,000 Subscribers
Helium Mobile now has more than 92,000 subscribers, showing the rising interest in decentralized wireless networks. Helium’s model uses blockchain technology to reward users for setting up and maintaining wireless coverage, which has attracted a large community and expanded its network.

Every time a new subscriber signs up, an NFT is minted, adding to the decentralized network’s appeal. Users can also earn MOBILE tokens by doing tasks like “Discovery Mapping,” where they share their location to help improve coverage. These tokens can pay for their phone plans or be traded for other cryptocurrencies.

Helium Mobile offers a $20 per month plan for unlimited talk, text, and data. It uses both the Helium network and T-Mobile’s infrastructure to provide coverage. This combination, along with strong community support and smart strategies, shows how successful decentralized models are becoming in telecommunications​.
The Number of Active DePin Projects Surpassed 1,200
The DePin ecosystem is flourishing, with 1,215 active projects currently underway, a total market cap of $47 billion, and an annual revenue run rate of $15 million, according to the DePin Ninja dashboard. 

Projects range from decentralized wireless networks to community-driven energy grids, showcasing the diverse applications of DePin technologies. The top five by market cap include Fetch.ai ($4.3 billion), Render ($3.56 billion), Filecoin ($3.3 billion), The Graph ($2.5 billion), and Arweave ($2.5 billion).

These developments point to a promising future for DePin, with rising user engagement and a growing number of active projects paving the way for decentralized solutions across various infrastructure sectors. Although DePin is still in its early stages and has several flaws, it enables the exchange of tokens between synthetic and real-world assets. This complements traditional infrastructure by providing last-mile coverage in areas where conventional models are not economically feasible.

Tokenized Treasuries and real-world asset (RWA) protocols have continued to show strong growth throughout 2024.Demand for tokenized U.S. Treasuries continues to rise, with real-world asset (RWA) protocols growing significantly this year.Tokenized RWAs, including treasuries, bonds, and cash equivalents, have grown 35% since the beginning of April. Over the same period, the total value locked (TVL) in Ondo Finance, one of the leading RWA-focused DeFi protocols, has increased to $507 million from $221M in April.Leading the charge is Blackrock’s $BUIDL (BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund), which has grown 65% since the start of the quarter, boosting the total tokenized Treasuries market cap above $1.5 billion. Franklin Templeton’s $FOBXX (Franklin Onchain U.S. Government Money Fund) also expanded by nearly 27%.Tokenized Treasuries Total Market CapThe RWA sector is separated into tokenized Treasuries, commodities, real estate, and stablecoins. The commodities and stablecoin markets have remained relatively flat, while Treasuries have commanded most of the attention over the last few months.As a result, Ondo’s native token is up 68% since the end of March, having rallied more than six-fold since its token generation event in January.Ondo Token Price YTD

Arbitrum DAO Approves Massive Gaming Fund | Bankless


Arbitrum DAO has approved a proposal to allocate 225M ARB (~$215M) over the next three years to supporting gaming projects. What's the scoop?Proposal Details: The Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP), proposed by Vela Exchange co-founder Dan Peng, aims to expand awareness and adoption of Arbitrum, Orbit, and Stylus with builders and players in the gaming community.Voting Results: The proposal passed with over 75% of votes in support, including entities like L2Beat, Wintermute, and Treasure DAO. Other major organizations opposed it, though, like Blockworks Research and Camelot DAO.Fund Allocation: The funds will be used for grants and investments of up to 500K ARB (~$484K) for new and established developers, infrastructure-related bounties, and operational expenses. A maximum of $25M is earmarked for the GCP team to manage day-to-day operations.Bankless Take:For years, gaming has been heralded as one of the industries most ripe for Web3 disruption. Despite this, few, if any, crypto-based games have achieved traction. That hasn’t stopped massive amounts of capital from being funneled into the mission to realize this integration of blockchains, even while returns from the sector continue to lag significantly behind other areas like AI, RWAs, and Bitcoin Layer 2s. That being said, one game may be all a chain needs to succeed, which could keep fueling this golden goose hunt, especially given Arbitrum’s support for Xai Network, a gaming-focused L3 on Arbitrum, and TreasureDAO, a gaming ecosystem that recently announced it would build a L3 on the network.

GameStop Could Start 'Biggest Bitcoin Adoption Story Of The Year' With This Move, Trader Suggests - GameStop (NYSE:GME) - Benzinga

Heavily-followed crypto trader The Bitcoin Therapist proposed that GameStop GME could significantly benefit from adopting a Bitcoin BTC/USD standard.What Happened: The Bitcoin Therapist suggested that GameStop could raise over $5 billion by issuing shares and converting this capital into Bitcoin at $70,000 per BTC. He outlined that this would result in approximately 71,400 BTC, potentially making it the most significant Bitcoin adoption story of the year.The trader emphasized that such a move could increase demand for GameStop’s stock and expand its base of Bitcoin holders.He further noted, "They are already an exceptionally overvalued company. They could continue to accrue Bitcoin and issue debt/shares to acquire more Bitcoin." This strategy, according to him, could reinvent GameStop's brand and facilitate its transition into a more serious digital gaming and commerce platform.The trader concluded the post with a challenge to GameStop, "Your move GameStop."Also Read: GameStop’s Roller Coaster: Roaring Kitty’s Live Stream Countdown Ignites Investor ExcitementWhy It Matters: Bitcoin Therapist's suggestion comes at a time when GameStop has been exploring various strategies to reinvent itself. The company has been in the spotlight for its volatile stock price and efforts to pivot towards digital and blockchain technologies.The potential for GameStop to hold a significant amount of Bitcoin could position it uniquely in the market, differentiating it from other retailers.During the Q1 earnings release, the company filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC regarding its at-the-market offering program, which allows the sale of up to 75 million shares. Before this capital raise, it had sold 45 million shares in mid-May raising around about $933.4 million in gross proceeds.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.

Monero price defies gravity ahead of the BitBot token launch



                    

                    Monero price continued to defy gravity as it surged to its highest point since January 30th. It has surged by over 80% from its lowest level this year, giving it a market cap of over $3.2 billion. The focus among cryptocurrencies is now shifting to the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rates decision and the ongoing ETF inflows.
Monero is defying gravity
Cryptocurrencies wavered on Monday as focus remained on the upcoming Fed decision. Bitcoin held steady below the crucial resistance point at $70,000. Other big cryptocurrencies like Ether and Solana remained in a tight range.
Many altcoins, on the other hand, went through a major sell-off as concerns about the Federal Reserve continued. This sell-off happened after the US published strong jobs numbers on Friday, raising the possibility that the Fed will hold rates steady in this week’s meeting. 
Monero, the biggest privacy coin in the world, was the best-performing token even though there was no major ecosystem news. Notably, the rally continued as Monero formed a golden cross pattern, which happens when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross each other. 
In most cases, this is one of the most popular bullish signs in the market. Most importantly, the token has risen above the key resistance level at $180, its highest swing in December last year.
Therefore, there is a likelihood that the bull run will continue in the coming days. If this happens, it will likely surge to the next level at $200. The stop-loss of this trade will be at $170. 

BitBot is seeing strong traction
It is against this backdrop that the BitBot token is gaining more traction in the market a few weeks after it concluded its highly-successful token sale. The developers raised over $4.3 million from investors. 
BitBot’s token sale was highly successful because of what the network is promising. According to its website, the developers are aiming to create the biggest AI-powered Telegram trading bot. 
This is notable because of Telegram’s scale as one of the biggest social media companies in the world with over 900 million users. 
The Telegram bot industry is doing well as demand for trading solutions jump globally. Recent data showed that these bots account to over $164 million worth of tokens every day.
As such, there are signs that it will gain traction because of its emphasis on AI and security. Unlike other Telegram bots, BitBot will be a non-custodial platform, meaning that its developers will not have access to users funds. 
BitBot’s developers are now working on the application. They are also preparing to launch the claiming process for the token. This is a situation where those who bought the tokens will be able to claim them when they start trading. Learn more about BitBot here.

$3 XRP Price Beckons As Ripple Pens Deal With Georgia’s Central Bank To Revolutionize Economy ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
The company behind the cryptocurrency XRP, Ripple, has struck a deal with the Republic of Georgia to digitize the local economy. Top officials from the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) recently met with the crypto firm’s executives to boost alliance in financial technology and digitalization.



National Bank Of Georgia Banks On Ripple’s Technology To Digitize Economy 



Ripple, a leading provider of enterprise blockchain solutions for cross-border payments, is strengthening ties with the Republic of Georgia.



According to a LinkedIn post on June 8 by the National Bank of Georgia, Natia Turnava, acting governor of the NBG, and Varlam Ebanoidze, head of the bank’s financial and supervisory technology development department, had discussions with Ripple’s vice president of central bank engagements, James Wallis.



The purpose of the meeting was to determine areas of collaboration in promoting the digitization of the Georgian economy. During the meeting, Wallis introduced the Georgian representatives to Alistair Brown, an official at Ripple’s partner EPAM Systems. While specific details of the meeting are scanty, the talks signal progress in incorporating cutting-edge blockchain solutions into the nation’s financial infrastructure.



Previous Ripple And Georgia Partnership



The new initiative builds on the previous alliance between the Georgian central bank and Ripple, where the San Fransciso-headquartered blockchain payments company serves as the official technology partner for creating lari, its central bank digital currency (CBDC) project.

&nbsp



Back in July 2023, Ripple was hailed by Currency Research for its contributions to digital currency advancement and the most promising sustainability initiative, specifically for its role in promoting innovation in the CBDC sector.



Ripple’s Global CBDC Endeavors



Before the collaboration with the NBG for the digital lari project, Ripple had notably aligned itself with financial institutions looking to foray into CBDC developments. 



Ripple previously teamed up with Colombia, Palau, and Bhutan, among others, to create digital versions of their national currencies. Ripple released a 23-page white paper last December, reiterating its belief in the potential of central bank digital currencies to boost financial inclusion, streamline cross-border payments, and support monetary policy control.



Ripple’s continued growth comes despite ongoing legal woes stemming from a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case against the firm lodged in December 2020. The legal battle is now headed for a conclusion after both Ripple and the securities regulator filed final responses. Analysts anticipate a final judgment around September when Judge Analisa Torres will rule on the appropriate remedies. 



As Ripple garners more large-scale adoption and the long-standing lawsuit nears climax, crypto enthusiasts will closely watch the company’s growth as ultra-bullish use cases look poised to catapult XRP to new historic highs with bulls eying the $3 aspirational level.



XRP is changing hands at $0.4974 as of publication time, a -0.1% change over the last 24 hours.

Coinbase Proposes New Metric To Accurately Track Blockchain and Crypto Adoption - The Daily Hodl


								Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, says there’s a need to accurately measure the true adoption of blockchains beyond what already exists.
In a new blog post, Coinbase says that as more applications launch, tracking the adoption of blockchain ecosystems becomes difficult as traditional metrics like total transactions or daily active addresses become distorted due to spam and Sybil attacks – an exploit that involves the forging of multiple identities in peer-to-peer networks.










To address these difficulties, Coinbase proposes using the h-index, which was originally created to measure the productivity and impact of scientific publications.
Coinbase says it has taken the h-index and adapted it to blockchains by tracking the number of addresses that have been on the receiving end of transactions the same number of times.
Says Coinbase,
“The h-index originated in academia as a way to quantify the research output and impact of a researcher, calculated by counting the number of publications that have been cited at least that same number of times. (For example, five publications that have been cited five times each would have an h-index of five.) 
We have adapted this metric to measure the activity on blockchain networks by looking at the number of addresses that have been on the receiving end of transactions at least that same number of times. In other words, an h-index of 100 means that 100 different receiving addresses had received transactions from at least 100 unique sending addresses over a given time frame.”
Using the new metric, Coinbase says that out of all the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains, ETH has the strongest level of adoption, followed by Base, Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Polygon (MATIC), Avalanche (AVAX) and Fantom (FTM).
“Our findings indicate that Ethereum and Base have the most widespread user activity of those measured, with Arbitrum and Polygon PoS following close behind.”

Solana To Flip Ethereum And Become "Altcoin Leader" In Next Bull Cycle: Analyst


								Solana and top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin are struggling at spot rates. Following the plunge on June 6, prices are under pressure, cementing the position of sellers who have been dominant since late May 2024. 
Will The Solana Uptrend Remain?
Even so, some analysts are upbeat, expecting not only altcoins to recover in the sessions ahead but specifically for Solana, a top-5 coin, to emerge as a leader in the next cycle. 

In a post of X, one analyst noted that provided bulls maintain the current uptrend, rejecting any attempt for lower lows, SOL will continue to float higher.

Of note, this will continue the trend seen from the better part of H2 2023, when the coin rose from obscurity to become one of the top performers, even outdoing Bitcoin. Looking at the daily chart, SOL is up 100% from January 2023 lows and roughly 8X from the pits of September 2023.
Even though there has been a cool-off after the rally to as high as $210 in March 2024, the uptrend remains. So far, SOL is down 25% from March peaks, with prices retesting a key support trend line. As bulls soak in selling pressure, attempting to reject bears of June 6, keeping prices above $160 will be crucial.
 
Solana price trending sideways on the daily chart | Source: SOLUSDT on Binance, TradingView
Though technical candlestick formations support this bullish outlook, there are favorable developments from the fundamental side of the equation. 
Solana Finds Adoption But Will Regulators Crack The Whip?
Increasingly, more financial institutions are integrating Solana to future-proof their offerings. So far, PayPal, Visa, and Stripe support Solana. 
Most importantly, as they integrate Solana, they recognize the need to adapt to rapidly changing user preferences, most of which are looking for cheaper and faster transactions. Solana boasts a theoretical throughput of up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS).
Meanwhile, though Ethereum has the largest network, it can only process 15 transactions every second, negatively impacting transaction fees. Depending on network demand, transferring tokens or executing smart contracts on Ethereum can be expensive. Fees fluctuate and, at one point, rose to over $50, according to YCharts data.

Though Solana is fast becoming a choice for institutions and meme coin deployers, there are ongoing challenges. In lawsuits filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance and Coinbase, the regulator alleges that Solana is an unregistered security. 

At the same time, unlike BTC and ETH, SOL, listed on the CME market, lacks a developed futures market. This absence, considered when the United States SEC wants to approve an exchange-traded fund (ETF), may take years before the product goes live.

Optimism Celebrates Stage 1 Decentralization With Permissionless Fault Proofs - The Defiant

Users can now permissionlessly execute withdrawals from OP Mainnet to Layer 1 Ethereum.The Optimism ecosystem is celebrating a significant milestone in its roadmap towards decentralization.On June 10, Optimism, the team behind the Layer 2 network, OP Mainnet, launched support for permissionless fault proofs on the network. The upgrade allows users to execute ETH and ERC-20 withdrawals without requiring actions from centralized third parties, and enables any OP Mainnet user to challenge and remove invalid withdrawals in exchange for compensation.“Governance-approved, permissionless fault proofs are live on OP Mainnet, and with them, the OP Stack arrives at Stage 1 [decentralization],” Optimism said. “In the coming months, we seek to roll out additional proof systems… on testnet.”The Optimism community overwhelmingly voted in favor of adopting permissionless fault proofs in a governance proposal that ended on May 30.Permissionless fault proofs will also roll out across other networks leveraging Optimism’s OP Stack infrastructure, including Base, Mode, and Zora, in the near future.Stage 1 decentralizationOptimism said OP Mainnet has now achieved “Stage 1” decentralization, a term coined by Vitalik Buterin to describe when a Layer 2 network is operating with “limited training wheels” in place.Withdrawals from rollups are executed through the network posting a Layer 2 state root value to the Ethereum mainnet. The root value allows the Ethereum mainnet to verify that funds have been withdrawn from Layer 2.Buterin said that Stage 1 rollups must feature an operational fraud or validity proof scheme enabling a project to accept or reject state roots in a decentralized fashion.Permissionless fault proofs allow any user to post root values so long as they provide collateral that can be forfeited in the event they behave dishonestly. Accounts disputing transactions must also provide collateral that can be slashed.Buterin said that Stage 1 projects can still maintain a multisig mechanism, often referred to as a “security council,” with the authority to override fraud or validity proofs to protect a network against malicious actors. These multisig accounts must comprise at least 8 different entities from outside of the project’s development team and require approval from at least 75% of signers.“While participation in the Fault Proof System is permissionless, the Optimism Security Council retains the power to intervene and revert the system back to a permissioned state in the event of a failure in the system,” Optimism said. “Having this fallback is part of a responsible and safe rollout of the Fault Proof System.”According to L2beat, OP Mainnet is now one of four Layer 2 networks currently operating at Stage 1 decentralization, alongside Arbitrum, ZkSync Lite, and dYdX v3. L2beat also lists DeGate v1 and Fuel v1 as having achieved Stage 2 decentralization, meaning no centralized entity can post state roots for a project.“Launching fault proofs on OP Mainnet… and achieving Stage 1 decentralization are important milestones, but the endgame is Stage 2 decentralization,” Optimism said.OP Mainnet is currently the third largest Layer 2 network with a total value locked of $7.31 billion, according to L2beat.

Optimism Finally Gets Its Mission-Critical 'Fault Proofs'

“We literally deleted the entire system essentially, re-architected it, and rewrote the entire thing,” Karl Floersch, the CEO of OP Labs, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “That was brutal, but absolutely the correct decision.”

Real Vision Analyst Jamie Coutts Issues Altcoin Warning As Markets Kick Off Week in the Red - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts is warning that the altcoin market is in a bearish trend after a strong six-month long run.
The former Bloomberg analyst tells his 18,400 followers on the social media platform X that most alts are now being outperformed by Bitcoin (BTC).










“A quick update on the altcoin malaise. Most crypto funds are overweight alts and not having as much fun as they would like, despite having a cracking six months from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024. Despite ETH’s recent outperformance, there’s been no follow-through (top chart) and the smart contract platform (SCP) sector continues to lag behind Bitcoin. The altseason index (bottom) confirms this trend, heading lower with only 18% of the top 100 assets (excluding stables) outperforming BTC.”
Source: Jamie Coutts/X
However, the analyst predicts alts will surge later this year and that the altcoin season index, which measures the profitability of digital assets relative to BTC, could start flashing bullish for alts within months.
“I still believe a turnaround will happen in the second half of the year – sooner rather than later, as liquidity at the margins is starting to improve (recent central bank cuts). 
Altseason signal: while the short-term alt price action remains bearish, a moving average bullish cross on the top chart and a reversal on the altseason index sub-chart would be a pretty clear signal that things have changed.”

Friend.tech Plans to Launch Friendchain | Bankless


Friend.tech, one of the leading crypto social apps, has announced plans to move from Coinbase's Layer 2 network, Base, to its own L2 called Friendchain.What's the scoop?Friendchain will be developed in partnership with blockchain infra provider Conduit.Friend.tech’s native token, FRIEND, will serve as the upcoming L2’s gas token. The timeline for the migration from Base is yet to be announced.Bankless take:The move isn’t necessarily surprising. In May 2024, Friend.tech’s pseudonymous founder Racer offered a $200,000 bounty for a chain migration plan in a since-deleted tweet amid their rising dissatisfaction with the Base ecosystem. Beyond the Base discontent, though, Friend.tech moving to its own chain allows it greater control over its tech stack and user experience. This autonomy can enable more tailored optimizations and potentially quicker experimental iterations on the platform's features.Also, the use of FRIEND as a gas token will introduce a new economic dynamic that will be worth tracking going forward, as many L2s don’t currently use their native tokens for gas. Success here will depend on how well Friend.tech can navigate the associated risks and capitalize on the strategic opportunities it presents.

Base Meme Coin Normie Removes Video Depicting Suicide, Following Backlash - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBase chain meme coin Normie has issued an apology after it posted a video depicting suicide in an attempt pump its token.The now deleted video (screenshot here; warning: disturbing content) showed the Normie character hanging itself, being buried in a cemetery, and then meeting a God-like figure. The deity tells Normie that they need to refund the community and relaunch to return to Earth. Then, the character jumps from their grave with news reports stating, “Death is not a problem.”The controversy comes after the project was exploited in May, causing its token to plummet 99% in a matter of hours. Since then, Normie has been working to regain trust by refunding those affected and relaunching a token with bolstered security.With the relaunch underway, the Twitter account has been posting promotional videos. Previous posts were generally met with positivity as the project attempted to recover from its exploit. But this time, it apparently went too far.Crypto Twitter went into uproar, with users suggesting that "Normie encourages suicide" or that traders should "send this atrocity to zero once and for all" due to "disgusting content.” Well-known crypto influencer Ansem simply replied, “Jesus Christ.” Ultimately, the project deleted the tweet with the video.“We have decided to remove our last video,” a Twitter post explained. “It was never our intention to trivialize a sensitive topic.”Instead, the post claims that the video aimed to explain that there is always a way out despite the brutal depiction of suicide. “The intern that posted it has been fired,” the post noted, though the concept of an intern being fired after a poorly received tweet has become something of a meme in the crypto space.Decrypt reached out to the Normie team for additional comment and clarification on that point, but did not immediately receive a response.That move received mixed responses from traders. In particular, some members of the community griped that an intern was purportedly fired for the post, as they believed others were responsible for what unfolded. Some speculated that the intern firing was just a joke, given the meme.Like most meme coins, NORMIE trading has been highly volatile over the past 24 hours, with the price rising and falling—but it's now down 16% over the past 24 hours at a current price of about $0.033.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Team With Major Warning to its Community: Details


																TL;DR

Shibarmy Scam Alerts warned about fraudulent websites targeting Shiba Inu users, urging verification of site legitimacy.
The Shiba Inu team previously cautioned about fake Dapps and deceptive offers, emphasizing double-checking URLs and avoiding suspicious links.


The Latest Alert
The X account focused on treats surrounding Shiba Inu and its native token SHIB – Shibarmy Scam Alerts – issued a stark warning to the community. The team claimed that multiple fraudulent websites have spread across the crypto space, posing substantial risks to people. Those websites were described as “a scam designed to steal your funds:” 
“There is no website you need to connect your wallet to so it can sync up with the network, refresh your rewards, fix any issues you may be having with liquidity pools.”
The team advised users to stay focused and always verify the legitimacy of a certain website before connecting their wallets. Using only official links from trusted sources was also labeled a top priority. 
Shiba Inu is one of the most popular meme coins and among the trendiest cryptocurrencies, which could explain why scammers target people from its community. The latest data shows that there are almost 1.4 million SHIB holders, with over 58% currently sitting on paper profits. The percentage was even higher a few weeks ago when the meme coin was at a better price condition.
As of the moment, SHIB is worth approximately $0.00002314 (per CoinGecko’s data), a 9% decline on a 14-day scale.

Previous Warnings
This is not the first time the Shiba Inu team cautions the community about potential dangers. Last year, Shibarmy Scam Alerts argued that scammers are “crafty” and can create decentralized applications (Dapps) that look nearly identical to legitimate platforms related to Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), Doge Killer (LEASH), and other memecoins.  
“Always double-check the name and URL of the Dapp to make sure you’re using the official and trusted version,” they added.
The team also claimed that “sneaky” fraudsters pretend to represent “reputable projects or services,” thus luring people into sharing personal data and later becoming victims. As such, verifying the authenticity of each account and Dapp is of utmost importance. 
Earlier this year, Shibarium’s Marketing Strategist, using the X handle LUCIE, advised the community to take any suspicious links from prominent individuals or entities “announcing unexpected rewards” with a grain of salt. The SHIB official believes those offerings most likely come from hacked accounts, saying people should refrain from connecting their wallets to dubious websites.

Nvidia's Rumored GPU Upgrades Will Fuel More Demanding AI Tools - Decrypt

Nvidia is reportedly preparing a significant upgrade to its lineup of laptop GPUs. The forthcoming RTX 50 series, codenamed "GN22," will feature six different variants, surpassing the five options offered in the current RTX 40 series, according to an apparent leak shared by security researcher Dominic Alvieri.If accurate, the most notable enhancement in the updated specifications is the increase in video random-access memory (VRAM). The baseline for the RTX 50 series will be 8GB of VRAM, a step up from the 6GB baseline in its current laptop GPUs.The lineup will reportedly include three models with 8GB of VRAM, two with a robust 16GB, and one with 12GB.This boost in VRAM will enable the new GPUs to run more artificial intelligence (AI) models, which often require substantial memory resources. For example, Stable Diffusion 1.5 requires at least 4GB of VRAM to run properly. SDXL requires at least 6GB to be able to run.When Stability AI previewed its forthcoming SD3 model, which will be much more capable and powerful, it used GPUs with 24GB of VRAM. Fortunately, different versions will be available, with 800 million to 8 billion parameters, and different configurations—such as excluding its 4.7 billion parameter T5 text encoder—will not be so demanding.The RTX 50 series will also leverage faster GDDR7 memory, according to the leak, further improving the performance of AI-related tasks and gaming.The leaked roadmap suggests that Nvidia plans to continue producing some older GPUs, such as the RTX 4050 and RTX 3050, with 4GB and 6GB of VRAM to meet the market's need for cheaper hardware. For gaming, 6GB cards are still solid options, as VRAM is not as important as the clock speeds and the number of processors or cores.These GPUs will reportedly be released in 2025, although no specific timeline was provided. There have been conflicting rumors, but a CES 2025 unveiling is possible.Buyers looking for cheap cards may have their days numbered, however. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Nvidia's main chip supplier, is said to be considering a price hike as its own expenses grow."We expect our customers to share some of the higher cost with us, and we already started our discussion with our customers," Wei said, according to Nikkei Asia.The report said Wei recently referred to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang as the "three trillion guy," referencing Nvidia's soaring market value, which surpassed $3 trillion last week.TSMC produces an estimated 90% of the world's most advanced processor chips and is a vital player in Nvidia’s success.Despite the potential for increased production costs, Huang expressed his support for TSMC's arguments, saying that raising prices is “consistent with the value that they deliver,” Nikkei Asia reported.Morgan Stanley analysts have suggested that if Nvidia accepts a price hike from TSMC, other key AI players may follow and raise their prices. They estimate that Nvidia will account for 10% of TSMC's revenue this year.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Crypto is the âideal ecosystemâ for Argentina, says Num Finance exec - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            A few Latin American countries are among the top 20 when it comes to crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis’ “Geography of Cryptocurrency Report.” The report points out that the most popular use cases in the region are international remittances and protection against inflation, the latter being especially seen in Argentina, where inflation surpassed three digits last year.Agustin Liserra, CEO of Argentinian crypto firm Num Finance, explained that Latin Americans need a tool for permissionless worldwide transactions, while also mitigating inflation and currency devaluation.
“These are things that people really suffer here in Argentina and in Latin America in general. I would also say that here in Argentina, with Milei’s government, inflation is decreasing rapidly. So we are below the one-digit inflation per month, and it is important to be clear on that because it doesn’t seem like a real success, but for Argentina, where last year the inflation was higher than 100%, to have annualized inflation in the month for maybe 50% or 60%, it is like an improvement,” said Liserra.
Despite the signs of recovery seen through the shrinking inflation numbers, Liserra highlights that consumption and economic activity as a whole are decreasing in Argentina. Moreover, some products are not available in the country, and crypto becomes the ideal ecosystem for “this kind of need.” Num Finance offers a tokenized version of traditional finance products, such as commodities, stocks, and currency-backed stablecoins. Furthermore, they offer income products based on these stablecoins. Liserra explained that the focus on these products is related to their liquidity and the regulation around their markets, keeping customers protected.
“And then when talking about mitigating the inflation with high yield products, for example, what we are doing with Num seems to be really useful for people to have a stablecoin of the national currencies, such as the Argentinian peso, with a really high yield compared to inflation, and a tool that helps to mitigate that […] We believe that we in crypto still have a lot of room for growth in the financial real-world side, so we are focused on that.”
On the regulation side, Liserra underscored that no significant developments were made in Argentina after Milei became head of the executive power. However, a regulatory bill might come to light next year.“There is no still regulation regarding obligations to inform the regulator about the operations the clients are carrying out with certain exchanges or things like this, but only a registry to let the regulator know who the players in the ecosystem are. And then the idea is to start working with the government and to elaborate a digital asset service provider regulation. I don’t think this regulation is seeing light this year, maybe the next one.”

Bitcoin NFT sales surge, flips Ethereum: A sign of BTC season? - AMBCrypto



Interest in Bitcoin NFTs grew as weekly sales surged.
Activity on the Bitcoin network continued to decline.

Ethereum [ETH] had been the undisputed champion in the NFT sector for quite some time. However, in the last few months, Bitcoin [BTC] managed to dethrone Ethereum and claimed the top spot.
NFTs makes a comeback
Bitcoin took the lead in NFT sales, experiencing a significant 55.42% increase, bringing its total sales to a staggering $49.74 million.
However, this surge came with a caveat. Wash trading, a practice of inflating trading volume through artificial buying and selling, also rose by 15.39%, exceeding $39,000.
This can cause concerns and questions about the legitimacy of some of this activity.
Interestingly, despite the wash trading increase, the number of active buyers on Bitcoin plummeted by nearly 96%, with only 2,056 addresses participating in the market.
Ethereum, the previous leader, followed closely behind with $35 million in NFT sales. This represented a slight decline of 0.31% compared to the prior week.
However, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum saw a higher number of active buyers engaging in the market, even though this number still reflected a significant 56.33% drop from the previous week.
Meanwhile, alternative blockchains were making strides as well. Polygon enjoyed a healthy 29.43% increase in sales, reaching $19.63 million.
Solana also witnessed growth, claiming the fourth position with $18.225 million in sales. Immutable X joined the party with a 12.77% increase in sales, further solidifying its presence in the NFT ecosystem.
Source: Crypto Slam
One of the more popular collections on the Bitcoin network was Quantum Cats. Over the past month, the NFT collection witnessed a 51% uptick in sales volume.
Moreover, the sales transactions for this collection also grew significantly by 33% during this period.
Source: CryptoSlam
Activity on the network
Despite the high interest in Bitcoin NFTs, the number of active addresses on the Bitcoin network fell materially. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data indicated that the daily active addresses on the Bitcoin network fell from 1.17 million 613,000 in the last 30 days.
The waning activity on the network impacts miners as well and affects their ability to generate revenue based on transactions on the network.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

Due to this miners can be forced to sell their holdings to remain profitable, causing selling pressure on BTC. However, the recent interest in BTC from whales can help BTC shake off the selling pressure.

Shiba Inu Community Targeted By Wallet Scam, Don’t Fall Victim | Bitcoinist.com


								The Shiba Inu team has cautioned against a new scam attack targeting community members. These malicious attackers have executed a sophisticated wallet scam that threatens to drain the funds of unsuspecting SHIB investors.   
New Scam Attack Targets SHIB Investors
Shibarmy Scam Alerts, an X (formerly Twitter) account dedicated to exposing scams within the SHIB community, has issued an urgent warning about a new wallet scam targeting SHIB token holders. On June 8, the scam tracker disclosed that a new wave of fraudulent websites is spreading across the crypto space. Most of these malicious sites are typically distributed within different social media platforms such as X, discord, telegram and more. 

According to Shibarmy Scam Alerts, these scam sites pose a significant risk to their investors and users, aiming to trick community members into compromising their wallets by using fake wallet connection tools. These malicious attackers lure unsuspecting Shiba Inu investors by claiming that they need to connect their wallet accounts to collect rewards or resolve technical issues involved with liquidity pools. 
The wallet connection tools also deceive SHIB holders into thinking that connecting their wallets via certain links is necessary for syncing with the Shiba Inu network. It’s important to note that these claims are entirely false and intended to steal users’ assets by jeopardizing their crypto wallet security.
The Shiba Inu community is one of the many cryptocurrency communities that are facing major challenges with scam attacks. The team has stayed dedicated to informing its investors and users of these scam attacks to protect them from financial loss and privacy risks. 
Just a few days ago, Shibarmy Scam Alerts disclosed malicious scammers impersonating official Shiba ecosystem accounts via fake Telegram accounts. The scam tracker also unveiled other attacks involving fake airdrops, fraudulent Shib reward distribution programs and multiple impersonators. 
Shiba Inu Scam Protection Tactics
The Shiba Inu team is committed to spreading awareness of scam attacks targeting its community, ensuring that its investors and users can remain safe within its ecosystem. In this regard, Shibarmy Scam Alerts has disclosed several ways SHIB community members can protect themselves against scam attempts in the community.

The team emphasized the importance of verifying the legitimacy of a website before engaging it or connecting wallets to it. This may be tricky, as scammers often create eerily convincing but fake websites designed to make wallet security vulnerable and steal funds. 
Additionally, Shibarmy scam alerts disclosed that users should endeavor to use official links from trusted sources and avoid clicking links from unverified sites. The team has stressed the need for vigilance to combat these scam attacks, emphasizing that community members remain updated on these scams and share information with fellow SHIBArmy members to help prevent potential financial loss. 
The members are also encouraged to double-check before connecting their wallets to any sites while also collectively adhering to the best security practices to reduce the chances of falling victim to scam attackers.

Apple Taps OpenAI to Bring Big AI Updates to iPhones and Macs - Decrypt

Apple is bringing ChatGPT to Siri, the company announced during its annual WWDC conference on Monday. Apple confirmed a long-rumored partnership with OpenAI as a key part of its new “Apple Intelligence” upgrades coming to iOS 18, MacOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. It represents the biggest overhaul to Apple's digital assistant since it was introduced in 2011.Apple users will be able to use OpenAI’s leading toolset, including its latest ChatGPT-4o AI model, across their Apple devices—but Siri will ask for permission, first.“We built support into Siri, so Siri can tap into ChatGPT’s expertise when it might be helpful for you,” Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said during the presentation. “You will be able to access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and your request and information will not be logged.”“For ChatGPT subscribers, you'll be able to connect your account and access paid features right within our experiences,” he added.Speculation around Apple’s generative AI ambitions has steadily increased since their iPad Event in May, leading up to WWDC, including rumors of an OpenAI partnership. Anticipation of the Apple AI push at WWDC pushed the company's stock price near an all-time high, reaching $195 early Monday.“We're excited to partner with Apple to bring ChatGPT to their users in a new way,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a separate announcement. “Apple shares our commitment to safety and innovation, and this partnership aligns with OpenAI's mission to make advanced AI accessible to everyone.”The new AI integrations will launch later this year, Apple said, and will be available on the iPhone 15 or later models and computers using Apple proprietary processor chips.Apple also showed off new ways AI will be added throughout its systems, such as image generation and editing, audio transcription, text summarization and writing assistance across apps, personalized emoji creation, and dozens of new photo and video features. And to deliver these upgrades, the company said its AI features will rely on private cloud computing.“These models run on servers we've especially created using Apple silicon,” Federighi said. “These Apple silicon servers offer the privacy and security of your iPhone from the silicon on up, draw on the security properties of the Swift programming language, and run software with transparency built in.”The encryption setup ensures that iPhones, iPads, and Macs will refuse to talk to a server unless its software has been publicly logged for inspection, he explained.“This sets a brand new standard for privacy and AI and unlocks intelligence you can trust,” Federighi said.Although Apple has taken steps to support AI development on its hardware and released open-source AI models, it is relatively late in openly embracing generative AI for its massively popular products and services, following wide-ranging AI-powered product releases from Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.Not all new AI announcements have been greeted warmly, however. Microsoft unveiled a new “Recall” feature that allowed users to find anything they've done on their computers in part through indexing snapshots of users' screens. After backlash, Microsoft reversed course.“Built in a uniquely Apple way, we think ‘Apple Intelligence’ is going to be indispensable to the products that already play such an integral role in our lives,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said.Wall Street was not especially impressed by the day's announcements, however, with Apple stock closing slightly down for the day priced at $193.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Bitcoin Economist Reveals Year-End Forecast for BTC Price - Bitcoin Sistemi

Economist Timothy Peterson suggested in a recent analysis that Bitcoin's difficulty growth rate points to a potential increase in BTC price to $100,000 by the end of the year.
Bitcoin's difficulty rating, a measure of how difficult it is to mine a new block on the blockchain, is adjusted every two weeks to ensure blocks are added approximately every 10 minutes. While this metric increases with more miners and computing power, it decreases when miners leave. Bitcoin's decentralized nature and automatic, transparent difficulty adjustments prevent any entity from manipulating it.


According to Peterson, Bitcoin's difficulty is closely related to its price. As difficulty increases, the energy cost per Bitcoin mined also increases, forcing miners to balance electricity and hardware expenses against potential rewards. High Bitcoin prices make these costs reasonable, making mining profitable even as the difficulty increases. Conversely, a price drop may force some miners to exit, reducing computational power and difficulty.

According to Peterson, there is a feedback loop between Bitcoin price and difficulty. Higher prices increase difficulty by attracting more miners, which can support higher prices. Conversely, higher difficulty and associated costs drive miners to increase efficiency and support higher prices as the network becomes stronger. The market strives for an equilibrium where energy costs are balanced by the price of Bitcoin.





Given these dynamics and current trends, Peterson predicts a reasonable year-end range for Bitcoin price will be $60,000 to $90,000. A high difficulty level indicates robust network security that supports higher prices, while energy costs also provide a price floor. However, the potential for increased adoption and positive market sentiment could push the price even higher, towards $100,000.

Get Started with Wasabi on Blast | Bankless


One of the hotter apps in the Blast L2 scene right now is Wasabi, a leverage trading protocol for long-tail assets like memecoins and NFTs.In other words, you can use Wasabi’s perpetual futures, which have no expiry, to long or short tokens that many other derivatives protocols don’t support. The idea? Trade culture, on leverage.Of course, if you’re not a derivatives veteran, leverage should be handled with care. But whether you’re interested in just dabbling or diving head-on into perps, Wasabi is particularly interesting for a few reasons:📈 Slick UX — I’ve seen my fair share of derivatives protocols since DeFi Summer in 2020, and Wasabi is arguably one of the simplest to navigate🪂 Wasabi SZN 2 — Using the project now ahead of the end of Wasabi Points Season 2 will make you eligible for an upcoming reward distribution, presumably the main Wasabi airdrop🪙 Blast Gold — Blast is conducting its much-anticipated airdrop on June 26th, and Wasabi still has over 150k Gold to distribute to its users between now and then; remember, 50% of the Blast airdrop goes to Gold holdersvia https://blast.io/en/airdrop?tab=DappAirdropsThe primary ways to use Wasabi are 1) by providing liquidity to Wasabi Vaults or 2) by trading Wasabi Perps. Let’s briefly walk through the basics of each of these offerings below. Depositing Into Wasabi Vaultsvia https://blast.wasabi.xyz/vaults?vault=Wasabi Vaults allow users to provide liquidity and earn rewards. Here’s how you can get started:Choose a Vault: Select from a range of vaults that support different Blast-centric assets. The most popular choices are the WETH and USDB Vaults, which are currently yielding 3.56% and 16.01% APR respectively. Deposit assets: Use the provided interface to deposit your desired amount of tokens into the vault. These assets will then be used to facilitate perps trades on the platform.Earn rewards: Earn a share of the trading fees and potentially other incentives like Wasabi Points or Blast Gold for the service of providing liquidity over time. Trading Wasabi Perpsvia https://blast.wasabi.xyz/?side=shortWasabi Perps allow you to take leveraged positions on a variety of Blast tokens. Here’s a quick guide:Select a pair: Choose the token pair you want to trade.Set leverage: Use the provided interface to decide on the size of your position in ETH and the level of leverage you want to use. Remember, higher leverage means higher risk.Enter a position: Go long (bet on the price going up) or short (bet on the price going down) on your chosen pair by pressing the “Open Position” button and completing the ensuing transaction with your wallet.Manage your trade: Monitor your position over time and close it with a transaction once it has risen or fallen enough for your taste. If you do try these perps, be sure to watch out for the liquidation price, which will automatically close your position if it’s reached. The liquidation price is shown in Wasabi’s “Active Positions” dashboard, so you can try to frontrun it to recoup some of your ETH if your position is sliding into the red and you want to abort.  Zooming OutIf you’re new to leverage trading, start with a small position to get a feel for how Wasabi works, and only play with money you can afford to lose. Also, keep an eye on the latest updates from Wasabi and Blast to stay on top of any further announcements around rewards in the coming weeks! Lastly, if you’re on the outside looking in and need to bridge funds into Blast, I recommend Relay’s fast bridge or Swaps feature for being user-friendly.

Ahmad Shadid's Departure as io.net CEO Is Not Because of Previous Allegations


																Ahmad Shadid, the founder of the decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) protocol io.net, has announced that he is stepping down as CEO “effective immediately.”
He said that despite the allegations against him in the past, his resignation as CEO is to allow io.net to move forward without interference.
COO Tory Green Takes Over
“Today I am stepping down as the CEO of http://io.net, effective immediately.” Shadid posted to X on June 9.
He added that the current Chief Operating Officer, Tory Green, will assume the role of CEO, stating, “While there have been allegations regarding my past, I want to emphasize that I am stepping down as CEO to allow io.net to move forward without distraction and to focus on its growth and success.”


Shadid also revealed his intention to donate one million of io.net’s soon-to-be-released tokens from his personal holdings to the Internet of GPUs Foundation to “help grow the ecosystem.”




In a separate post on X, Tory Green responded to Shadid’s announcement, noting that under Ahmad’s leadership, io.net has evolved into one of the fastest-growing AI companies globally. Green emphasized that moving forward, the company will continue to pursue Ahmad’s vision of becoming the world’s largest AI compute network and making AI accessible worldwide.


Green highlighted the company’s achievements, noting that the network has onboarded approximately 20,000 cluster-ready GPUs and is serving AI companies like WonderAI, Krea, and Leonardo with end-to-end AI inference and model training workloads.
Green also assured stakeholders that the company’s operations had been smoothly transitioned under his oversight and mentioned that more details regarding the leadership team changes would be shared in the coming days.
IO Token Launch and Concerns
The io.net token, IO, will debut on Binance’s Launchpool on June 11 at 12:00 am UTC, with an initial release of 95,000,000 tokens and a total supply capped at 800,000,000 tokens.
Meanwhile, Shadid’s resignation has caused concerns that he might dump his IO tokens at launch and disappear. “Looks like a rug. He got his coins now he dumps on launch and disappears,” noted one X user.
However, Shadid has addressed these concerns by stating that his tokens are locked for four years and that no investor, adviser, or team member can sell their monthly vested tokens until June 2025.

“It’s the Last Chance To Buy Altcoins Super Cheap”, Says Crypto Expert | Cryptoglobe


                                
Michaël van de Poppe, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst and trader, is based at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and frequently shares his insights on various social media platforms, particularly X (formerly known as Twitter). 



On 10 June 2024, Van de Poppe posted a detailed analysis on X, emphasizing that this could be the last chance to buy altcoins at super cheap prices. He noted that despite a strange bull market where Solana has performed exceptionally well and Bitcoin has rallied to an all-time high pre-halving and after the U.S. launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, altcoins have remained silent.



Van de Poppe suggested that a reversal for altcoins is very likely on the horizon. He mentioned in his videos from the previous week that he had swapped his coins towards newer ones and went all-in on altcoins over a month ago. Van de Poppe stated that his strategy has not changed and encouraged his followers to check out his recent YouTube video for more details on his strategy.



He argued that this is the right period to take more risks with everything happening globally. The crypto analyst pointed out that the European Central Bank (ECB) had announced a rate cut, which likely indicates that the Federal Reserve (FED) in the US will do the same in the coming months, potentially leading to increased liquidity as quantitative easing is initiated.



Furthermore, Van de Poppe highlighted that spot Ethereum ETF has been approved but not yet listed. He explained that the current situation is a vacuum with no price action because the 19B-4 forms have been approved, but the S-1 forms have not. He drew a parallel to the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, which did not provide positive price action initially but led to a significant upward run once trading started on the exchanges.



Van de Poppe argued that the current market situation is comparable to January of this year, noting that altcoins have provided terrible returns recently. He predicted that once spot Ethereum ETF start trading in the U.S., likely later this month or early July, it will be a “sell the rumor, buy the news” event for the markets, with altcoins expected to rotate upwards.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

He believes the U.S. SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is a significant confirmation for the entire blockchain and crypto ecosystem, potentially classifying many projects within the Ethereum ecosystem as commodities, thus increasing their potential. Van de Poppe emphasized that most venture capital investments are directed towards the Ethereum ecosystem, which could lead to a market repricing based on the current information.



Reflecting on past events, van de Poppe noted that the spot Bitcoin ETFs’ initial trading marked the peak of altcoins in their Bitcoin valuations, after which altcoins suffered significant losses. He suggested that the start of trading of US-listed spot Ethereum ETFs could mark the reversal of this trend, serving as a confirmation that altcoins exist alongside Bitcoin.



The analyst pointed out that Bitcoin is at an all-time high, while Ethereum and other altcoins are significantly below their 2021 highs. He argued that spot Ethereum ETFs will likely attract substantial liquidity to the Ethereum blockchain from institutional investors, reigniting interest in the ecosystem.



He revealed that his portfolio is heavily invested in the Ethereum ecosystem, based on fundamental research and high-conviction tokens. Van de Poppe stressed his transparency in sharing his buying and accumulating strategies.



He concluded by addressing the recent hype around other assets like BRC-20 and AI, expressing his preference for focusing on undervalued assets. Van de Poppe acknowledged his past mistakes but remained confident in his investment approach, emphasizing his willingness to take risks in his portfolio.

Loopring's ‘Most Secure’ Smart Wallet Breached For $5 Million - The Defiant

The attacker managed to compromise Loopring’s 2FA service.Loopring, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, reported a security breach on Sunday that resulted in the loss of $5 million worth of tokens.Hackers exploited Smart Wallets which relied on a single Guardian, specifically targeting the Loopring Official Guardian.“The attack succeeded by compromising Loopring's 2FA service, allowing the hacker to impersonate the wallet owner and gain approval for the Recovery from the Official Guardian,” Loopring tweeted. “Subsequently, the attacker transferred assets out of the affected wallets.”Loopring describes its Smart Wallet as the "most secure Ethereum wallet," which supports social recovery, multi-signature security, and integration with Layer 2 solutions.The Guardian service allows users to designate trusted wallets for security actions such as locking compromised wallets or restoring access if the seed phrase is lost. In this breach, the hacker bypassed the official Guardian service and was able to impersonate wallet owners to initiate recovery processes.In response to the attack, the company said it has temporarily suspended all Guardian-related and 2FA-related operations to prevent further breaches.Loopring has also shared two wallet addresses that it claims were used in the attack. Blockchain data reveals that one of these wallets drained around 1,373 ETH, worth $5 million.Loopring's native token, LRC, dropped 2% on the news.Surge in Smart Wallet AdoptionSmart Wallets have been gaining traction after ERC-4337 enabled account abstraction on the Ethereum mainnet. The update allows users to customize their wallets for specific needs, including automated transactions, multi-signature wallets, and social recovery.Introduced in September 2021 by Vitalik Buterin, ERC-4337 has brought new Smart Wallet capabilities. Buterin promoted features like "social recovery," which eliminates recovery phrases.Before ERC-4337, some companies had already pioneered their own smart wallet functionalities. Loopring and Argent, for instance, developed their own Smart Wallets back in 2020. More recently, Coinbase launched its Smart Wallet.While Smart Wallets improve functionality and provide a better user experience (UX), they also come with new risks and attack vectors that traditional externally owned accounts (EOA) wallets don't face.In April, when EIP-3074 was approved for inclusion in Ethereum's next major upgrade, Pectra, several key figures in the Ethereum community warned that these capabilities could make wallets more vulnerable to scams.“It should allow a scammer to drain your entire wallet with a single off-chain signature,” warned Itamar Lesuisse, the co-founder of Argent, a Starknet wallet provider. “I expect this will be a major use case.”

Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tokens RNDR, TAO, AGIX Prices Slump as Apple's Developer Event Fails to Impress

The decline happened as expectations were high for the tech giant to reveal its AI plans and how it would weave artificial intelligence into its offerings at this week's Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC2024). The firm on Monday announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features for iPhones, Mac and other products, and a partnership with Sam Altman's OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into Apple software.

Moody's Makes Statement on Likelihood of a FED Rate Cut - Bitcoin Sistemi

Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi said in a recent interview that he believes the Fed should consider lowering interest rates, arguing that the central bank has achieved its economic goals.
Zandi's comments came amid ongoing debate about the FED's current policy stance. “I think they achieved their goal,” Zandi said, adding: “We are at full employment. The unemployment rate increased slightly last year to 4%, which is consistent with a full employment economy.”


According to Zandi, inflation has been running at the Fed's target of 2% for the past six to twelve months, excluding landlords' imputed rents. Zandi questioned the need to maintain the current high rate of 5.5%, arguing that the economy may not need such a restrictive monetary policy.
“The equilibrium rate, which is the rate that neither promotes nor constrains growth, is higher than it has been historically for a variety of reasons, but it is not 5.5%,” Zandi said. Warning that maintaining high interest rates could risk economic stability, Zandi said, “As long as the FED keeps its hand on the neck of the economy, it risks breaking something.”





During the discussion, CNBC's Sarah Eisen noted that the Fed's target is relying on the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which has not yet reached the desired 2% level. Zandi acknowledged this, but said the trend was moving in the right direction, pointing out that the difference was largely due to the way the implicit cost of home ownership was measured.

Eisen expressed concern about the potential for inflation to reignite, especially given the strong employment and wage growth figures recently announced. Zandi countered by attributing the strong employment numbers to higher immigration and noting signs of a softening labor market, including higher unemployment and hiring rates compared to the previous year, layoffs, unfilled positions, temporary jobs and declines in hours worked.


Despite the strong job market, Zandi believes fundamental data does not point to an impending economic momentum. “Year-on-year inflation in CPI is 3%, meaning real growth is zero last year,” he said and added: “This does not show that things are accelerating.”
Asked whether the Fed's current policy is misguided, Zandi expressed concern that delaying rate cuts until September could have more significant economic repercussions. While he acknowledged that the economy was resilient and could avoid a hard landing, he argued that the risks of policy failure were increasing.





“The most likely scenario is that they pull it off and the economy has a soft landing,” Zandi said. “But the risk of making a mistake here also increases. The question is: Why would they take that risk?”

Crypto Analyst Predicts 800% Rally To $6,000 For BNB, Here’s The Timeline


																BNB has been one of the best performers coming out of the long and drawn-out bear market of 2022. Even now, the altcoin continues to show a lot of strength, suggesting that its run is far from over. According to one crypto analyst, this expected run for the BNB price could last longer and drive the price higher than expected, predicting an over 800% increase in price from here.
BNB Showing Strength On The Monthly Chart
A pseudonymous crypt analyst who goes by the moniker Without Worries on the TradingView website has shared an interesting outlook for the BNB price. The analysis uses the BNB monthly chart, showing that the altcoin remains bullish even after rallying over 150% in the last year already.

	Related Reading


Without Worries points out that the BNB price action looks to be in a legacy uptrend channel. Now, channels like these are rare because it means that the altcoin has been in this uptrend channel since it launched. To put this in perspective, the crypto analyst points out that altcoins like Litecoin is one of the ones which has failed to maintain a legacy uptrend channel.
Furthermore, the analyst points out that the BNB price is currently seeing its third test of resistance at the time that the initial analysis was posted, which was on June 3. This third resistance test comes after three years of consolidation. However, this time around, it’s looking more bullish for the altcoin following the resistance test.
One major factor driving the bullishness around BNB is the fact that the Stochastic RSI had crossed above 80. This is important because the last time that this had happened was back in May 2020, just before the coin went into a full-blown rally. “This is the same situation as today. Stochastic RSI remains with momentum for 182 days. Should history repeat, momentum continues until August / September,” the analyst stated.
Price Breaks Out Of Resistance
In a follow-up post, crypto analyst Without Worries revealed that the BNB price has now successfully broken out of the third resistance. Now, going back to the initial analysis, Without Worries points out that such a situation would trigger a massive breakout for the BNB price.

	Related Reading


The top of the target for the BNB price is placed at $6,000, which is a more than 800% increase in price from here. “The bull flag pattern confirms a breakout AND support. A measured move from the flagpole of the last resistance breakout takes price action to $6000,” the analyst said.
Source: Tradingview.com
As for the timeframe for when this will happen, the crypto analyst expects the rally to fully play out sometime in September. This means around 16 weeks or a little less than four months from now. If the analysis is correct, then BNB is just getting started.

Solana's Io.net CEO Steps Down 2 Days Before Token Launch


								Ahmad Shadid stepped down as CEO of the Solana-based DePIN Protocol io.net on Sunday. The decision came two days before the launch of io.net’s token, IO. As a result, the crypto community was skeptical of the decision and the former CEO’s past.

Solana-Based DePIN Project Changes Management
Two days before the IO token launch, Ahmad Shadid announced he was stepping down “effective immediately” as CEO of io.net. The Solana-based protocol is a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) designed to “provide unlimited computing power to machine learning applications.”
Io.net aggregates GPUs from different storage providers to offer cost-efficient GPU computing power to AI and ML teams. Additionally, it allows users to earn money renting out their spare GPU capacity.
According to Shadid’s post, the decision was taken after careful consideration and is “in the best interest of the community and the project.”

Moreover, he claimed he would show gratitude to the ‘IO Nation’ by donating 1 million IO tokens from his allocation to io.net’s GPU foundation “to help grow the ecosystem.”
Tory Green, former COO and co-founder of the project was named the new io.net’s CEO. Green assured users that the project will continue working towards achieving its goal of becoming the “largest AI compute network and bring AI to the world.” He stated:

AI compute spend is on track to be on the order of $100B in 2024, and yet there remain significant and structural gaps in access to existing resources. io.net’s vision is a world where AI products of the coming decade are built on open, permissionless platforms that are accessible to all. We’re excited to continue building the internet of GPUs.

Crypto Community Unsure Of Io.net’s Future
Shadid claimed that his decision was unrelated to the allegations against him. The former CEO explained he wanted the Solana-based project to operate without turbulence.

I want to emphasize that I am stepping down as CEO to allow io.net to move forward without distraction and to focus on its growth and success.

Nonetheless, the community had mixed feelings towards the news. Some users agreed that the resignation was the best step for io.net’s future, while others found the timing suspicious.
Several community members expressed skepticism, stating that a dump after launch was possible. Shadid addressed this concern, explaining that he has a “4 years lockup + vesting.” He also detailed that no investor, advisor, or team member can dump the community as they won’t get their monthly vesting tokens before June 2025.
However, io.net’s co-founder didn’t address the other claims. Some users brought forward the scamming allegations of Shadid’s past and urged investors to stay away from the project.
One X user accused Shadid of being a “well-known scammer in the Arabic crypto community” who has “been a serial scammer since 2018.” The user cited several social media posts and videos compiling the alleged scams conducted by Shadid.
Furthermore, Martin Shkreli has accused the Solana-based project of misleading the community and manipulating the information they provided. To some investors, Shadid’s resignation “basically legitimized” Shkreli’s claims and could suggest a bearish future for io.net.
Nonetheless, many expect to see how the situation develops after the launch. Io.net’s IO token is set to launch on Binance’s Launchpool on June 11. According to the crypto exchange’s announcement, 95 million IO tokens will be released at launch, and trading will start at noon UTC with the IO/BTC, IO/BNB, IO/FDUSD, and IO/TRY trading pairs.

Roaring Kitty Is Down Over $350 Million on GameStop Since Thursday - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIn the last four days alone, meme stock influencer Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, has lost over $350 million on his GameStop (GME) position. You wouldn’t tell by his demeanor. As GME continued to shed value on Monday, Gill mocked his own fortunes, posting memes on Twitter belittling his financial status. And as the price fell in real time during his Friday livestream, his first in three years, he wore fake bandages and had his arm in a splint while acting injured.But the hits taken over the last few days by the world-famous stock trader are no joke. Just last Thursday, Gill was riding high with over $382 million in profit (on paper, at least) from options placed on GME, according to screenshots of an ETrade account he posted on Reddit. Then, a dismal quarterly earnings report from GameStop sent the stock spiraling. On Friday, Gill lost over $235 million on his GME position. The bloodshed continued on Monday, when GME slipped an additional 12%, after plummeting 40% in the hours just before the weekend.GME closed at $24.83 on Monday afternoon. To give some sense of the loss: In after-hours trading on Thursday evening, the stock had climbed as high as $61.27.  The price movement has wiped out nearly all of Gill’s recent gains. By Monday evening, the influencer reported he was still about $31 million in the black—meaning he’s lost about $351 million in profit since last week. It remains unclear whether Gill’s entire GME pot may also be in legal jeopardy.Last week, reports surfaced that regulators are investigating Gill over manipulation concerns for a series of cryptic (and not so cryptic) tweets over the last few weeks, which have sent GME and other meme stocks and associated crypto tokens soaring. Even ETrade itself is reportedly considering banning him as a user. The saga is somewhat reminiscent of the famed 2021 short squeeze of GME stock by retail traders, which Gill architected. In that case, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the matter, but ultimately determined that no market manipulation had occurred.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Fidelity International joins JPMorgan’s tokenized network - Blockworks


Fidelity International joined JPMorgan’s Tokenized Collateral Network (TCN) on Monday, the firms announced. 
In yet another display by traditional financial institutions, the international company — which is wholly separate from the US firm — tokenized shares of its money market fund through TCN. The network sits on Onyx Digital Assets, JPMorgan’s private blockchain network based on Ethereum.
“The ability to post MMF shares as collateral directly without first redeeming to cash offers the prospect of greater efficiency and stability in times of market stress,” a press release said.

“TCN has started with the tokenization of money market shares, with a view to expanding across equities, fixed income and a range of asset classes,” it continued. “The ability to tokenize assets and use them under both title transfer and pledge structures, outside of any limiting market operating hours, has the potential to create new opportunities in the collateral market.”
The first tokenized transaction took place on TCN in October of last year. JPMorgan’s trading services teamed up with its Onyx Digital Assets to create the network.
“Fidelity‘s participation in TCN brings its MMF units onto our network through tokenization, adding a new asset that is otherwise prohibitively complex to use across today’s collateral landscape,” said Keerthi Moudgal, Onyx Digital Assets’ head of product.

“As Fidelity joins the TCN, we’re thrilled to enable this step in its journey and are excited by the potential benefits from ODA’s continued growth,” she continued. 
This isn’t the first venture into digital assets for Fidelity International. The firm also has a bitcoin exchange-traded product available on European exchanges. While the product also goes by the ticket FBTC (similar to the US fund), it doesn’t have a connection to the US-based firm of the same name.
“Tokenizing our money market fund shares to use as collateral is an important and natural first step in scaling our adoption of this technology. The benefits to our clients and the wider financial system are clear; in particular, the improved efficiency in delivering margin requirements and reduction in transaction costs and operational risk,” said Stephen Whyman, head of debt capital markets at Fidelity International.
On the US side of things, other traditional financial institutions have turned their attention to money market funds onchain.
Both Franklin Templeton and BlackRock have funds, with Franklin announcing the ability to convert USDC to USD in order to fund their investments just last week. It first announced its fund in April of last year.
BlackRock has BUIDL, which it announced earlier this year in partnership with Securitize, and it was the world’s largest asset manager’s first foray into a tokenized fund.

StarkWare's plans add momentum to Bitcoin upgrade - Blockworks


When it comes to upgrading Bitcoin, no one fully knows how it works. Unlike other chains, the original cryptocurrency doesn’t have a clear process to upgrade.
Progress happens along a slow-moving social consensus, a delicate dance between researchers, coders, project maintainers, full node operators and miners.
Sometimes you can spot an inflection point, though.
Last week offered up solid evidence of the growing momentum for proponents of OP_CAT — or just CAT for short — now also known by the memey moniker BIP-420.
Read more: Satoshi-era Bitcoin code idea gets a boost from Taproot Wizards 
Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, originally introduced OP_CAT. He then removed it without giving a reason — the deletion relegated to a “miscellaneous” section of a GitHub pull request.
“No one knows why because he didn’t say,” said Udi Wertheimer on an X Space discussing the prospective upgrade last week.
Wertheimer speculated that Satoshi probably didn’t fully recognize the potential of CAT, and simply disabled it because no one was using it at the time.
As a member of the Quantum Cats, and among the chief advocates for reintroducing the opcode, Wertheimer’s fond of pointing out that Satoshi introduced it in the very first release of Bitcoin in 2009, and that it represents a mere eight lines of code.
“It’s really crazy because it’s such a simple change,” Wertheimer said, but one which modern cryptographers have worked out to enable a whole host of features such as trustless BTC bridging, offchain layer-2s, AMMs, simplified Runes trading, privacy solutions and payment systems.
Fellow Quantum Cat co-founder Eric Wall chimed in to say that the group gets “way too much credit.”
The basic need for “covenants” — restrictions placed on how coins can be spent in the future, based on specific conditions — has been a consensus view for years in Bitcoin circles.
One alternative, OP_CTV, is seen by some as too big of a change, Wall said.
Read more from our opinion section: Don’t fossilize Bitcoin
“OP_CAT is extremely simple — it doesn’t make any changes to the script interpreter of Bitcoin,” Wall said, so it hasn’t met the same resistance from other Bitcoiners.
“It’s just a downhill slope, so if you actually put some weight behind that, that wagon would slide down the hill way easier than any of these other covenants OPcodes,” he said.
StarkWare adds its heft
StarkWare is predominantly associated with scaling Ethereum via its Starknet zk rollup. For years, StarkWare co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson has had in the back of his mind the idea of scaling Bitcoin using STARK proofs. 
“I was red-pilled at the Bitcoin conference in 2013,” Ben-Sasson told Blockworks, noting it was “always a dream” for Starknet to connect to Bitcoin.
The 2021 Taproot upgrade was one step closer to making that a reality. CAT would be another.
“We strongly believe in the power of this math to solve this problem,” Ben-Sasson said. If covenants via CAT are adopted, then you will be able to verify STARKs. “That’ll be the gold standard,” he said.
To stay true to Satoshi’s vision, Bitcoin scaling needs to preserve a self-custodial nature, with sovereign individuals, and be resistant to censorship.
Current sidechain solutions contain too many compromises, according to Ben-Sasson, who proposes that Starknet become the first network to simultaneously scale Bitcoin and Ethereum.
StarkWare is putting up $1 million to fund research towards this goal, alongside a commitment to publicly champion CAT. 
Wertheimer is now confident the upgrade will be activated this year.
“I think this community started looking at this as something that is real, and that made a massive difference,” he said, noting CAT is like a meme — it becomes stronger as more stakeholders rally behind it.
StarkWare, bitcoin miners, core developers, people who support the Lightning Network, “they all want this and that’s why I’m pretty sure it’s going to happen,” Wertheimer said.
How does a soft fork get passed?
Tyler Whittle, who calls himself a Taproot Wizards “sorcerer,” has put together BIP Land in “an attempt to elucidate the [soft fork] process in a lighthearted but cutting manner.”
He described it as “historical artifacts about how Bitcoin has been upgraded in the past.”
CAT is at the “testnet graveyard” stop, meaning it has been deployed on Signet — a testing network where the bitcoin has no value — so that developers can start building on it today.
But no developers decide by fiat whether something can get included in a BTC Core software upgrade.
“Many people will tell you Bitcoin isn’t ever upgraded the same way twice,” Whittle said.
Wertheimer wants to bring back a more practical builder and tinkerer mentality to Bitcoin development with CAT.
“The problem right now with Bitcoin development is that everything is so hypothetical and theoretical, and no one really can spend the resources to really get into the weeds and build things out to see what you need,” he said.
To the extent that there are builders on Bitcoin, they’re working with what they have today.
Alexei Zamyatin, co-founder of a hybrid layer-2 combining Bitcoin and Ethereum (BOB), told Blockworks he’s “on the conservative side” when it comes to CAT.
“Anything that makes Bitcoin more expressive is helpful to build better bridges, better custody models and ultimately is relevant for any project building on Bitcoin, especially [layer-2s] like BOB,” Zamyatin said.
But he’s not in a rush to see the change implemented. The code base is different, the scale is bigger, the stakes higher.
“What we need now to get this over the finish line, if this is ever to happen, [is] people to experiment with it on testnet, build apps, showcase how it works and see where the issues lie and what the risks involved [are],” he said.
There are also options for Bitcoin scaling that don’t require a soft fork, such as BitVM, which Zamyatin said is “the best tool that we have to actually get a zk verifier to work in some way on Bitcoin” for now.
Read more: Bitcoin research expands on design space for smart contracts
He is encouraged by StarkWare’s involvement, however.
“It’s great to see that more and more projects realize the potential of going beyond culture wars and actually trying to get the best out of Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Zamyatin said.
Jesse Eisenberg, co-founder and chief technology officer at DLC.Link, thinks much of CAT’s potential “is still yet to be discovered.”
“It would be like a Swiss-army knife for Bitcoin, but inside a bit of a black box, as it’s quite difficult to reason about,” Eisenberg told Blockworks.
Read more: Building a better wrapped bitcoin for DeFi
But, like Zamyatin, he’s cautious and suggests OP_CTV or OP_VAULT could be the preferred option, although these wouldn’t provide all the same functionality as OP_CAT, such as recursive covenants.
“This seems to have lots of potential, but there are risks of powerfully simple systems that are hard to reason about,” Eisenberg said.

Statement from Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson: "ADA Is Preparing For The Biggest Change In Its History" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Blockchain platform Cardano (ADA) is on the verge of a significant transformation. Founder Charles Hoskinson announced that the platform is ready for the upcoming Chang fork, which is “the most important turning point in history” and will usher in the “Age of Voltaire.”
In his post on his social media account on June 9, Hoskinson said, “It seems that June will be the month when Cardano Node will reach 9.0. This means that Cardano is ready for the Chang fork and 70 percent of SPOs are ready for the new node.” “Then a hard fork could occur, pushing Cardano into the Age of Voltaire.” said.


The Chang upgrade is considered a pivotal development for Cardano as it provides the essential tools and infrastructure to support the “Age of Voltaire.” According to Hoskinson, this era is poised to provide the final elements needed for the network to become self-sustainable.
The Voltaire era empowers network participants to propose improvements for Cardano, subject to a vote by stakers who benefit from the existing staking and delegation process. It is also establishing a treasury system to finance future network development. A portion of all transaction fees will be pooled to fund development efforts agreed upon during the voting process.






According to Hoskinson's statement, once these voting and treasury systems are operational, Cardano will be fully decentralized and will no longer be under the management of IOHK.
Commenting on the update, Hoskinson said, “This is the most important milestone in the history of Cardano and for the industry as a whole. Cardano will be a decentralized civilization spanning the entire world with millions of residents. We will have the most advanced blockchain management system, annual budgets, a treasury, and the support of our entire community to guide us.” We will have your wisdom.” said.

Charlie Munger Once Said, 'Just Say No' To Putting Bitcoin In Retirement Accounts: Legendary Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Was Never A Fan Of Cryptocurrency - Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU) - Benzinga

The annual Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKBRK shareholder meeting drew thousands to Omaha, Nebraska each year to hear investing wisdom and stories from Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.The event also featured a highly anticipated question-and-answer session with audience members, which featured this legendary Munger anti-crypto quote in 2022.What Happened: The 2024 annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting was a significant one. It was the first to not feature Munger sitting beside Buffett. Munger passed away in November 2023 at the age of 99.Many Berkshire Hathaway investors or those that closely follow the company will remember the sharp wit and quotable anecdotes from Munger along the way.In 2022, an audience question asked about the best investment idea in the current economic climate of rising inflation. The audience member asked what the best stock was to buy right now, hoping to get some advice from Buffett and Munger.Buffett wouldn't give a specific stock and instead told the audience member to invest in themselves and be the best in whatever field they choose.While the question was about stocks, Munger took his advice a different direction."When you have your own retirement account and your friendly adviser suggests you put all the money into bitcoin, just say no," Munger said at the time.Related Link: Warren Buffett’s Hometown Residents Don’t Leave, Even After Becoming Billionaires: ‘Get Rich And Then Keep It To Yourself’Why It's Important: While Munger wouldn't give advice on what stocks to buy, he made sure the audience member knew where they shouldn't put their money.Munger and Buffett have both been vocal critics of cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin BTC/USD.Buffett previously called Bitcoin "rat poison" and has been targeted as an enemy of Bitcoin, with Peter Thiel previously calling him enemy number one of the apex cryptocurrency.Buffett also warned shareholders about new forms of money that have been created, without singling out Bitcoin by name. He told shareholders Berkshire always has a lot of cash on hand."The United States government affects that this became exchangeable for lawful money in the United States," Buffett said in reference to a $20 bill.Buffett said that inflation could make the $20 bill worth less in terms of purchasing power. "But that when people tell you that they're issuing new forms of money, this is the only thing that will pay bills under some circumstances," he said.The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC has brought more institutional money into Bitcoin and perhaps changed the way that long-time investors are thinking about the leading cryptocurrency.Buffett remains anti-crypto and Munger was until his death.Benzinga previously noted that Berkshire Hathaway owns a stake in Nu Holdings NU.

Bitcoin Whales Go Long Big At $69,000: All Up From Here?


								Data shows the Bitcoin whales on cryptocurrency exchanges Bybit and HTX have opened massive long positions at the current price levels.
Bitcoin Taker Buy Sell Ratio Has Spiked For Bybit and HTX Recently
In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has revealed that the whales on the HTX platform have opened large long positions recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “Taker Buy Sell Ratio,” which keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin taker buy and taker sell volumes.
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the taker buy or long volume is greater than the taker sell or short volume right now. Such a trend implies the derivatives market currently shares a bullish majority sentiment.

On the other hand, the indicator being less than this threshold can imply the dominance of a bearish mentality in the sector, as the short volume outweighs the long volume.
Now, here is a chart that shows the recent trend in the Bitcoin Taker Buy Sell Ratio specifically for the HTX exchange:

The value of the metric appears to have been quite high in recent days | Source: @ki_young_ju on X
As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin Taker Buy Sell Ratio for HTX has recently spiked extremely high. This would imply that the platform’s users have just opened a large number of long positions.
This sharp increase in the indicator has come following BTC’s drop towards the $69,000 level. Thus, it would appear that the whales on the exchange think this dip is worth making large bullish bets at.
Another member of the CryptoQuant staff, Maartunn, has made a quote-repost of the post from Ju about this development at HTX and has noted that the Bybit platform has also witnessed a large spike in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio at the recent lows.

Looks like the metric has also registered a large value for this exchange | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
From the graph, it’s apparent that while the spike in the Bitcoin Taker Buy Sell Ratio for Bybit has also indeed been quite large on its own, the scale of it is still not quite as extraordinary as what has been observed on HTX.
Nonetheless, the metric reaching these highs implies that the orders on the platform from the whales have also heavily tended towards the long side. Thus, it would appear that the large entities from at least two exchanges have decided to open up big bullish bets at the recent price levels.

It now remains to be seen whether these long positions will pay off for these colossal Bitcoin investors.

Is Ethereum's price dip signaling the start of a new rally? - AMBCrypto



More whale addresses have accumulated ETH in the last few weeks.
ETH’s bull trend has continued to weaken with the price drop.

Ethereum [ETH], which has been moving closer to a bear trend over the past few days, has presented a buying opportunity for large investors. 
According to recent data, big wallets have acquired more Ethereum as the price declined, which is a bullish signal.
Whale addresses scoop up Ethereum
AMBCrypto’s analysis of some major Ethereum addresses revealed a slight increase starting from the end of the previous month. Specifically, wallets holding over 10,000 ETH showed growth beginning around the 19th of May. 
At this point, the number of such wallets was approximately 952, and Ethereum was trading at around $3,074.
The number of wallets holding over 10,000 ETH grew from around 952 to approximately 980 as of this writing. 
Despite the ETH price increase to around $3,700, these addresses have continued accumulating more Ethereum.
Source: Glassnode
Additionally, AMBCrypto’s look at the mega whale chart over the last 30 days revealed a noticeable development: the trend has flipped to the upside. 
This indicated an increase in accumulation by most of the major wallets, reflecting heightened buying pressure.
 With this move, it is just a matter of time before the price picks up—a trend that these addresses are betting on.
More Ethereum flows out of exchanges
Ethereum’s Netflow on CryptoQuant showed that it had been dominated by negative flows in the last few weeks. The chart indicated that the volume of outflows has consistently surpassed inflows in the new month.
Source: CryptoQuant
A look at the chart showed that since the beginning of the new month, more ETH has left exchanges than has flowed into them. 
The analysis indicated that from the 1st of June to now, the negative flow volume was over $354 million, while the positive netflow volume was around $226 million. 
This netflow trend, combined with the accumulation by major wallets, is a positive sign for ETH despite its recent price trend.
ETH moves closer to the neutral line
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Ethereum on a daily timeframe showed that it has been trending in the $3,600 price range for the past three days. 
As of this writing, it is trading at around $3,670, experiencing a decline of approximately 0.8%. ETH saw a slight gain in the previous trading session, but the recent decline has wiped this out.

Realistic or not, here’s ETH’s market cap in BTC’s terms

Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) showed that it was above 52 as of this writing. However, the RSI is on a downward trend, indicating that a further price decline could push it below the neutral line. 
This means that while the trend is currently bullish, it is weakening.

Elon Musk Says He Will Ban Apple Devices From His Companies If They Integrate OpenAI - Decrypt

Elon Musk has threatened to ban Apple devices at his companies after the tech giant announced that it would integrate OpenAI’s flagship AI model, ChatGPT, across its product line—potentially affecting billions of iPhones, Macs, and iPads.“If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies,” Musk posted to Twitter following Apple's AI announcements on Monday. “That is an unacceptable security violation.”The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and co-founder of Neuralink said the policy would extend to guests as well.“Visitors will have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage,” he vowed.Musk is certainly not the first company executive to ban AI tools from its offices. In fact, Apple itself banned employees from using ChatGPT—the same tool the tech giant is now tapping to enhance its 13-year-old virtual assistant, Siri.In another tweet, Musk questioned Apple’s decision to partner with OpenAI instead of building its own generative AI model.“It’s patently absurd that Apple isn’t smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security and privacy,” Musk wrote.In announcing its ChatGPT partnership, Apple stressed that Siri would ask users for permission before connecting to the AI model, and that its implementation would be encrypted and kept private and secure. Musk was skeptical.“Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI,” he tweeted. “They’re selling you down the river.”The explosive emergence of ChatGPT has sparked bans at several organizations. Last year, the U.S. House of Representatives prohibited staffers from using ChatGPT over privacy concerns. At the same time, Samsung also banned the use of ChatGPT on company systems.Musk had not previously objected to increasing integration of AI into hardware and software by other big tech companies, including Microsoft, Meta, and Google—which has also introduced a smartphone with deep AI integration. His aversion to ChatGPT specifically, versus AI in general, likely stems from longstanding bad blood between him and OpenAI.The billionaire has repeatedly spoken out against OpenAI, the company he co-founded in 2015 along with Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Andrej Karpathy, and several others. In fact, Musk took credit last May for the creation of OpenAI, saying it wouldn’t exist without him."I was instrumental in recruiting the key scientists and engineers, most notably Ilya Sutskever," Musk told CNBC. "Ilya joining was the linchpin for OpenAI being ultimately a success."In March, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Sam Altman, accusing the company of straying from its humanitarian roots."This case is filed to compel OpenAI to adhere to the founding agreement and return to its mission to develop AGI for the benefit of humanity," Musk said in the complaint, "not to personally benefit the individual defendants and the largest technology company in the world."In response to Musk's lawsuit, OpenAI published internal emails that suggested Musk was also motivated by profit.“We need to go with a much bigger number than $100M to avoid sounding hopeless relative to what Google or Facebook are spending,” Musk allegedly wrote. “I think we should say that we are starting with a $1B funding commitment. This is real. I will cover whatever anyone else doesn't provide.”OpenAI did not respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Loopring Smart Wallets Suffer a $5 Million Exploit


																On Sunday, Loopring, an Ethereum zero-knowledge roll-up protocol, announced a significant security vulnerability attack on its smart wallets, linked to the Loopring Official Guardian.
The project is collaborating with security and law enforcement agencies to investigate how the two-factor authentication system was compromised and to track down the cybercriminals.
Loopring Official Guardian Exposed
In a comprehensive announcement shared on platform X, Loopring disclosed that the attacker targeted a subset of the wallet, capitalizing on the vulnerabilities of the Official Guardian. As such, some wallets within Loopring fell victim to this security breach.


The malicious actor circumvented Loopring’s authorized Guardian services by impersonating wallet owners. This allowed them to initiate unauthorized recoveries on wallets that relied solely on the compromised Guardian without the permission of the actual users.




By specifically targeting the Official Guardian and 2FA service, the attacker siphoned substantial assets from several wallets.
Loopring and blockchain audit firm Cyvers Alert identified and publicly shared the two malicious wallets. Onchain data from Etherscan revealed that one of the hacker’s wallets seized about $5 million worth of assets from the compromised wallets. The wallet has already swapped the crypto for ETH and still holds 1,373 ETH worth $5 million.
It is important to note that not all wallets were exposed. Wallets employing multiple guardians or alternative third-party guardians were not affected by the recent exploit.
Commitment to Protect Investors
Loopring announced on their X platform that they are working with Mist security experts and law enforcement agencies to determine how their two-factor authentication service was compromised and to track down the malicious actors.
To protect users, Loopring has temporarily suspended all Guardian-related and 2FA-related operations, which has since stopped the compromise. The network encourages anyone with additional information about the exploit to come forward and commits to providing updates as the investigation progresses.
As per their report, they remain steadfast in showing their commitment to safeguarding the interests of their users.
According to data from Coingecko, Loopring’s native token, LRC, experienced a slight reaction when news of the attack emerged. It is currently trading at $0.2199, reflecting a 2.7% decrease in the past 24 hours and an 18% decrease over the past 7 days.

World's largest bank ICBC praises the evolution of Bitcoin, Ethereum as innovative financial assets

The world’s largest lender, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), recently published an in-depth analysis highlighting the rapid evolution and growing diversity in digital currencies, where it compared Bitcoin to gold and deemed Ethereum “digital oil.”The report emphasizes the human capacity for imaginative belief, as noted by historian Yuval Noah Harari, as a driving force behind the exponential growth in digital currency types and applications.VanEck head of digital assets research Matthew Sigel noted:“Chinese SOE banks keep writing love letters to Bitcoin and Ethereum.”The ICBC report outlines the divergent development paths of various digital currencies, each addressing unique needs within the financial ecosystem.The love letterAccording to ICBC’s report, market demand has fueled innovation in the digital currency sector, from the birth of Bitcoin (BTC) to advancements in Ethereum (ETH) and the exploration of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).ICBC said that Bitcoin has managed to retain a scarcity similar to gold through its mathematical consensus mechanism. The flagship crypto has resolved issues related to divisibility, authenticity verification, and portability. The report added that despite Bitcoin’s waning monetary attributes, its status as an asset is solidifying.Meanwhile, Ethereum provides “technical power for the digital future” and is establishing itself as “digital oil” capable of powering myriad applications across the web3 ecosystem.Ethereum, distinct from Bitcoin, incorporates Turing completeness through its proprietary programming language, Solidity, and its virtual machine, EVM.This feature allows developers to create and manage complex smart contracts and applications, positioning Ethereum as a critical platform for DeFi and NFTs. The report also acknowledged Ethereum’s potential to extend its influence to decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePin).Despite the potential, Ethereum faces several practical challenges, including security vulnerabilities, scalability issues due to high computational demands, and significant energy consumption.Ethereum developers are exploring various solutions to address these challenges. The introduction of the Proof of Stake (POS) consensus mechanism and sharding technology in the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade aims to enhance network throughput and sustainability.  Additionally, developers are working on Layer 2 solutions such as state channels, side chains, and rollups to improve scalability.Stablecoins and CBDCsThe report also highlighted the crucial role of stablecoins in bridging the gap between the digital currency market and the real world. Stablecoins, which peg their value to traditional assets like fiat currencies, offer stability in the volatile crypto market.ICBC said that stablecoins facilitate seamless transactions and provide a reliable store of value, making them an essential tool for everyday financial activities and a bridge for integrating digital currencies into the global financial system.Furthermore, CBDCs represent a significant innovation in the modern monetary system. By digitizing fiat currencies, central banks can improve the efficiency of payment systems, reduce transaction costs, and enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.According to the report, CBDCs can streamline cross-border transactions, reduce reliance on intermediaries, and offer greater financial inclusion by providing access to digital financial services for unbanked populations.The report noted that the development and implementation of CBDC infrastructure requires careful consideration of privacy, security, and regulatory implications to ensure their success and widespread adoption.The report concluded that while the development vision for each digital currency varies, all aim to enhance financial inclusion, security, and payment efficiency. As digital currencies continue to evolve, developers and policymakers need to focus on balancing sustainability, security, and efficiency.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Forget Shiba Inu And Dogecoin, Crypto Whales Are Buying Millions Worth Of This Meme Coin | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto whales are gearing up for what might be an interesting week for PEPE. On-chain data reveals crypto whales have been busy over the weekend as many look to position themselves before the start of the new week. Amidst this positioning and accumulation, PEPE has shot up as an interesting option for a few whales.
Crypto Whales Make Large PEPE Purchases
PEPE is coming off of a seven-day period of intense volatility and bearish momentum. Price action indicates the meme coin lost about 20% of its value last week, and it seems some whales are going with a buy-the-dip strategy. Multiple transactions involving billions of PEPE tokens were recorded. According to on-chain data, there were multiple instances of whales buying millions worth of PEPE during the weekend, giving a glimpse of whether the decline might be coming to an end. 

A notable example of this strategy is the accumulation of 447.67 billion PEPE tokens worth $5.48 million by venture capital firm Nascent. As noted by Spot On Chain, this interesting accumulation by Nascent means PEPE is now the biggest cryptocurrency in its portfolio, indicating the company’s fervent belief in the meme coin. 


Lookonchain revealed another intriguing accumulation.ording to the on-chain tracker, a particular whale withdrew 231.6 billion PEPE worth $2.9 million from Kraken over the weekend. Interestingly, this wasn’t a one-off purchase, as transaction data shows this whale has been accumulating since March 16. This whale has now withdrawn approximately 750.34 billion PEPE worth $8.34 million from Kraken during this timeframe.
Yet another PEPE accumulation example over the weekend was the withdrawal of 303.4 billion PEPE worth $3.8 million from Binance and OKX into two private wallets 0x81cC and 0xf226, respectively.

PEPE Taking A Leg Up
The last seven days haven’t been rosy for PEPE investors, considering the meme coin decline in the middle of market challenges. Price data shows that PEPE fell from $0.00001524 to a low of $0.00001193, indicating a 21% decline over the week. However, a recent change into positive price percentage indicates that the meme coin is starting to rebound in response to whale accumulation over the weekend. With whales making such large splashes in PEPE, it may not be long before retail investors start experiencing FOMO and pile into the meme coin themselves.

At the time of writing, PEPE is trading at $0.00001239 and has been up by 0.72% in the past 24 hours. This price recovery suggests PEPE might continue on a leg up for the rest of the week.

Trader Unveils List of Five Strong Altcoins Including Injective Amid Choppy Market Conditions - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst is listing five altcoins he believes are showing strength despite the choppy market conditions.
Pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 217,200 followers on the social media platform X that layer-1 protocol Injective (INJ), cross-chain protocol Wormhole (W), data democratization project JasmyCoin (JASMY), Bitcoin (BTC) layer-2 scaling solution Stacks (STX) and layer-1 blockchain Toncoin (TON) all look bullish amid a generally range-bound market.










“Eyes on these for active trades, a lot of stuff looks like cr*p right now.” 
According to the analyst, Wormhole is one of his top picks. However, he warns that it’s still possible for W to pullback and stagnate.
 “W is one of the strongest coins out there right now, would keep an eye on this if you are actively trading. I want to buy this on the breakout – if you see it pull back strongly, it’s still going to be trading within this same range and not ready for the big move we all want.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
W is trading for $0.644 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.
Moving on to JASMY, Altcoin Sherpa says the token looks “extremely strong” and will likely rise to its resistance level before it corrects.
“JASMY extremely strong. No clue what this thing does but it didn’t even budge today, honestly looks like it could go all the way to $0.067 before any significant pullback.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
JASMY is trading for $0.0397 at time of writing, a 5.25% increase during the last 24 hours.

Sora Who? Kling Is the New AI Video Generator Everyone Is Talking About - Decrypt

While OpenAI’s forthcoming Sora AI video generation tool has creatives both tantalized and horrified, a new player has emerged that has many AI enthusiasts crowing about its capabilities. Developed by Kuaishou, a Chinese tech giant and competitor to TikTok, Kling is also already available—with some caveats.Kling's capabilities surpass the competition in several significant ways. Kling can generate videos up to two minutes long in 1080p resolution at 30 frames per second. This is a substantial improvement over Pika and RunwayML, which can generate only a few seconds each—and it’s twice as much as what OpenAI said Sora would handle.Kling appears on the scene shortly after the release of Vidu, another Chinese AI video creation tool developed by Shengshu Technology and Tsinghua University. Vidu generates shorter videos, but can create highly realistic and detailed videos with Universal Vision Transformer (U-ViT) technology, which has already proven superior to Runway and Pika.For its part, Kling uses advanced 3D face and body reconstruction technology to generate realistic movements and limb movements based on a single, full-body picture. It also avoids other common problems that some AI video generators have when depicting people, such as extra or impossibly bent limbs.Like Sora, Kling also has a better understanding of real-world physics, allowing for more accurate simulation of physical interactions between objects. It’s also designed to accurately follow prompts and create sequences of shots with multiple views, allowing for more complex and dynamic videos.Image: Kling/KuaishouKuaishou released a series of demo videos showing how Kling would render the scenes OpenAI demonstrated with Sora. The videos seemed very realistic, with good scene compositions and movements. The quality was superior to Runway and Pika in terms of realism and consistency, and was on par with Sora—even surpassing it in some generations.Some users have shared other creations on social media, and they seem convincing enough to justify the hype.Kling is currently available as a public demo in China through a waitlist, but Kuaishou is promising a wider global release.The Kling website is in Mandarin and appears to require a Chinese phone number in order to register. You will also need to download the Kwaicut app and follow the steps shown on the official Kling-AI website before securing a place in line.Until then, for those looking to generate AI videos, the best choices are Pika Labs, RunwayML and—for local generation—Stable Video Diffusion.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Rally 50,000% To $250, Here’s When


																Crypto analyst Chad Steingraber has made an ultra-bullish price prediction for the XRP price, stating that the crypto token’s price could rise to three figures. The analyst also outlined when this price target will be attained. 
XRP Will Hit $250 In This Market Cycle
Steingraber mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that XRP will reach $250 by 2025, which he believes will represent the market top for the crypto token in this bull run. He made this prediction while stating that Bitcoin and Ethereum will hit $250,000 and $25,000 in 2025, which will also be their market top.

	Related Reading


Steingraber has previously provided several reasons why he is so bullish on XRP and believes the crypto token could attain such heights. He once alluded to a potential XRP ETF as one factor that could trigger significant price surges for XRP. He explained that an XRP ETF would give the crypto token an added utility as fund issuers for the XRP ETFs will direct their assets into an institutional liquidity hub. 
He believes an XRP ETF will drive more demand for the crypto token, ultimately driving up its price when a supply shock occurs. Steingraber also believes that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple is one of the factors suppressing XRP’s price up until now. 
He had earlier claimed that XRP’s price wasn’t going up because new money wasn’t flowing into its ecosystem and affirmed that the crypto token would likely see an influx of new money once the SEC’s case against Ripple is over. Steingraber isn’t the only one who believes that XRP’s price could skyrocket and climb to three figures once the lawsuit ends. 
Crypto analyst JackTheRippler also predicted that XRP would rise above $100 once the case ends. The analyst even gave a more bullish prediction than Steingraber’s, stating that XRP hitting $10,000 was achievable after the lawsuit. Crypto analyst CryptoBull also predicted that XRP could reach three figures, rallying 28,900% to $154. 
XRP Price To $7.5 In The Meantime
Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has suggested that XRP rising to $7.5 is the price target to watch before the crypto token reaches the heights analysts like Steingraber predict. In an X post, he stated that “$7.5 is target number 1.” Egrag went on to outline how this move to $7.5 will likely take place.

Source: X
He stated he is highly convinced that XRP will break the white triangle (on the chart he shared) and hit the measured move at $1.5. From there, he expects XRP to make its move to $7.5. However, he warned that the Fib 1.618 zone where $7.5 is situated is “critical” and that a lot of profit-taking will happen there, suggesting that XRP could significantly decline once it reaches such heights. 
Egrag added that the next targets for XRP will be “mid-double digits near Fib 2.414 & 2.618” if XRP archives a weekly close above Fib 1.618.

BNB's Price Surge Propels Binance's CZ To Richest US Prisoner Status With $38B Net Worth | Bitcoinist.com


								Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, recently hit an all-time high of $725 on June 6th, the first week of exchange founder Chagpeng Zhao’s (CZ) four-month prison sentence in the US. 
According to a Bloomberg report, this price rally for the Binance Coin has made CZ the richest person ever to serve time in a US federal prison. Despite his legal troubles, the token’s market capitalization surpassed $109 billion in the past week, based on data from CoinGecko. 
BNB’s Price Surge Mirrors Exchange’s Rise? 
Per the report, Binance Coin’s price trajectory mirrors the fortunes of the exchange itself, as the total value of assets on the platform has climbed from approximately $80 billion in early January to $125 billion currently. 
This growth has further solidified Binance’s dominance in the cryptocurrency industry despite a challenging period last year that culminated in the company paying a historic $4.3 billion fine to settle a case with US authorities.

BNB holders benefit from trading-fee discounts on the Binance platform. The token is also utilized for fee settlements on Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain widely used by crypto applications, including games and exchanges.
The recent surge in BNB’s value was foreshadowed by derivative market trading patterns in late May, followed by increased spot demand in June, as buying consistently outpaced selling between June 2 and 5, as Kaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert noted. 
While BNB trades on several centralized exchanges, Bloomberg notes that Binance remains the dominant platform, accounting for 85% of BNB’s trading volume globally.
Binance Founder CZ’s Wealth Surpasses $38 Billion
As previously reported, Binance had faced allegations of anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions breaches, including failing to prevent access to the exchange by groups such as Hamas, Al Qaeda, and other militant organizations. Zhao agreed to pay a personal fine of $50 million as part of the settlement. 
However, this amount is relatively small compared to Zhao’s estimated net worth of $38.5 billion, a fortune primarily denominated in BNB. Zhao has previously stated that he is a significant shareholder in Binance.

Referred to as “CZ,” Zhao currently ranks as the 40th wealthiest person globally, with his net worth having grown by $4.1 billion in 2024, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. 
While the extent of Zhao’s BNB holdings remains undisclosed, a 2017 whitepaper from BNB’s initial coin offering (ICO) revealed that 80 million tokens, valued at approximately $56 billion today, were allocated to the founding team. 
Overall, despite the legal and regulatory challenges faced by Binance and its co-founder, the surge in the value of BNB highlights the continued interest and confidence in the token and its associated ecosystem.

At the time of writing, BNB was trading at $652, down 4% in the last 24 hours. However, on a year-to-date basis, the token is up a substantial 176%.

XRP Whales Make $28 Million Binance Outflow: Bullish Sign?


								On-chain data shows the XRP whales have made some large outflows from the Binance exchange, a sign that may be positive for the asset’s price.
XRP Whales Have Made Some Transactions During The Past 24 Hours
According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a few large transactions have been spotted on the XRP network during the past day.
All of these transfers have been of a scale generally associated with whale entities. Whales are humongous investors capable of moving large amounts quickly across the market, thus having the potential to move the price of the asset.
As such, the moves made by these holders during the last 24 hours can be worth knowing about as, even if they don’t end up having any visible effects on the cryptocurrency, they can at least provide possible hints about the sentiment among these large investors.

First, the latest of these transfers involved the movement of 26,440,906 XRP, which was worth almost $13.2 million when the transaction went through on the blockchain.
Naturally, the consequences this transfer may have depend on the whale’s intent behind making it. It’s usually hard to say anything about it for sure, but the address details can sometimes provide some hints. Below are the details for this XRP whale transfer.

Looks like this transfer only took a negligible fee of 0.003 XRP to go through on the blockchain | Source: Whale Alert
As is visible above, the sending address in this transaction was a wallet attached to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, while the receiver was an unknown wallet.
Unknown wallets aren’t affiliated with any known centralized platform and are likely to be the investors’ addresses. Moves like this, where coins go from exchanges to unknown wallets, are exchange outflows.
Investors may withdraw from the custody of these central entities to hold onto their coins for extended periods, so exchange outflows can potentially have a bullish effect on the price.
The second whale transaction from today was also an exchange outflow; just like this one, it involved the Binance platform.

This exchange outflow was even greater, as the whale withdrew 30,406,274 XRP (around $15 million) from Binance with it. Naturally, these two whale outflows can be a positive sign for the cryptocurrency.

The third and oldest transaction from the past day, though, wasn’t so bullish. It was an exchange inflow, which is the opposite type of transaction.

With this transaction, an investor deposited 30,320,000 XRP ($15 million) on the Bitstamp platform. Holders usually transfer their coins to exchanges whenever they want to use one of their services, which can include selling.
As such, exchange inflows can be bearish for the price. While this inflow is sizeable, it’s only large enough to cancel out one of the outflows, so a net amount of the asset has still fled the custody of exchanges during the past day.
XRP Price
XRP has experienced a drawdown of around 4% in the past week, pushing its price down to $0.50.

Polygon beats Ethereum in key area - What it means for MATIC - AMBCrypto



Polygon has beaten Ethereum in terms of gas usage and overall activity.
The price of MATIC fell considerably over the last few days.

Polygon [MATIC] witnessed a massive uptick in activity over the last few months and has slowly and steadily garnered attention from multiple users.
Polygon races to the top
Due to the growing popularity of Polygon, it outperformed Ethereum in terms of gas usage. Moreover, Polygon had outdone Ethereum in terms of monthly active users.
Source: token terminal
If users are flocking to Polygon for its lower fees and faster transactions, it could slow down Ethereum’s adoption rate.
However, it’s important to remember that Polygon isn’t a direct competitor, but rather a Layer-2 scaling solution built on top of Ethereum. In the long run, a thriving Polygon ecosystem could actually benefit Ethereum.
What about MATIC?
Even though the Polygon network made significant progress, MATIC wasn’t able to see green.
Even though the price of MATIC moved sideways for the most part, there was a steep decline observed when the price hit the $0.7413 level on the 6th of June.
The OBV (On Balance Volume) for MATIC declined materially during this period. A declining OBV during this period suggested that selling pressure outweighed buying pressure for MATIC.
A positive CMF, even at a low value like 0.03, indicates that there might still be some money flowing into MATIC despite the OBV decline.
A positive CMF with a lower trading volume could suggest larger investors or whales accumulating MATIC despite the short-term price dip.
Source: Trading View
Apart from whale interest, there was retail interest in MATIC observed as well.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data indicated that the addresses holding anywhere between 0 and 100 coins had increased their rate of accumulation.
The rise in the accumulation of MATIC suggests that many traders are looking at the recent price dip of MATIC as an opportunity to buy the token at a discount.

Realistic or not, here’s MATIC’s market cap in ETH’s terms

Despite MATIC struggling to see growth in terms of price, Polygon managed to do really well in the DeFi sector.
Notably, Polygon’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS), zero-knowledge Ethereum [ETH] Virtual Machine (zkEVM), and Coconut Development Kit (CDK) have become the go-to options for DeFi developers.

Why Bitcoin’s Big Breakout Is Just Around The Corner, According To These Experts


								Bitcoin’s price stability below $70,000 over the past months has sparked various speculations and analyses among traders and investors.
While the crypto community grapples with the cryptocurrency’s lackluster performance, notable crypto figures like Samson Mow and Adam Back have presented their perspectives, offering a hopeful outlook for the future of Bitcoin’s valuation.

Analyzing The Factors Behind BTC Price Behavior
Samson Mow, a staunch Bitcoin advocate and CEO of Jan3, has publicly forecasted a dramatic upsurge in Bitcoin’s price despite its recent period of price stagnation.
In sync with Mow’s optimism, Adam Back, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency sphere with historical ties to Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, has suggested that the current suppression in Bitcoin prices may be attributed to urgent selling by certain market participants needing liquidity.
According to Adam Back, these sellers are depleting their Bitcoin reserves, hinting at a potential market rebound once these assets are fully liquidated.
This perspective is supported by data indicating active basis trading where Bitcoin is collateral rather than BTC ETFs. Additionally, the ongoing purchase activities through CME futures suggest an underlying demand waiting to influence market prices.
Echoing Back’s analysis, Mow highlighted the increase in short interest among newer traders, which he considers unsustainable. He anticipates that these short positions will likely lead to significant liquidations, which could catalyze a sharp price increase.

Mow metaphorically described Bitcoin’s current price level as a “compressed coil,” poised to explode upward, reflecting a strong rebound that could disrupt the market’s temporary stasis.
Global Economic Indicators and Rate Cuts: Their Impact on Bitcoin’s Market Stability
In the broader context, the crypto market is witnessing cautious movements, as seen with BTC’s slight uptick of 0.9% over the past week, maintaining its consolidation below the $70,000 mark.

This cautious trend is mirrored in global economic reactions. Recent US non-farm payroll data inducing a “risk-off” sentiment among investors has led to a shift away from riskier assets amidst prevailing economic uncertainties.
As central banks worldwide, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada, implement rate cuts, the investment landscape is adjusting to these changes, with implications for cryptocurrency markets, particularly BTC.

Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital notes this as a “buy the dip” moment, recognizing potential bullish signals amidst the market’s fluctuations.

DeFi Technologies Adopts Bitcoin as Treasury Reserve


DeFi Technologies Inc., a leading Canadian financial technology (fintech) company, has embraced Bitcoin (BTC) as its primary treasury reserve asset. This strategic move involves an initial purchase of 110 BTC, which signifies the company’s integration of traditional capital markets with decentralized finance (DeFi).
The decision aligns with the broader trend of companies seeking portfolio diversification and alternative revenue streams amid changing economic conditions.
DeFi Technologies Invests in Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Inflation

Recognizing Bitcoin as a major asset class with a market value surpassing $1 trillion, DeFi Technologies considers it an effective inflation hedge. Bitcoin’s scarcity, finite nature, digital resilience, and architectural stability make it a more attractive option than traditional assets. Olivier Roussy Newton, CEO of DeFi Technologies, expressed the company’s confidence in Bitcoin.

“We have adopted Bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset, reflecting our confidence in its role as a hedge against inflation and a safe haven from monetary debasement. As the best-performing asset over the past decade, Bitcoin offers significant short to long-term potential to expand the company’s treasury,” Newton noted.

DeFi Technologies’ latest venture has garnered attention from notable figures in the crypto industry. Anthon Pompliano, a prominent Bitcoin advocate and the founder and partner of investment management firm Morgan Creek Digital Assets, shared his thoughts on the company’s move.

“Bitcoin is slowly seeping into public company treasuries around the world. We remain shareholders of DeFi Technologies (DEFTF) and believe the business is still undervalued,” he wrote on X (Twitter).

The decision by DeFi Technologies comes amid significant monetary policy shifts. Recently, the Bank of Canada (BoC) decided to lower its key policy rate from 5% to 4.75%, aiming to ease the burden on highly indebted consumers.
Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper for both consumers and businesses. This change potentially leads to increased spending and investment.
Lower interest rates can also mean reduced capital costs for companies like DeFi Technologies. Moreover, as returns on safer investments decrease, the attractiveness of alternative assets such as Bitcoin increases.
Matteo Greco, a research analyst at Fineqia, shared his thoughts on this perspective. Greco emphasized Bitcoin’s potential to act as a leveraged version of gold for those who believe in its store-of-value attributes.

According to him, viewing Bitcoin as a store of value makes sense for portfolio allocation. While gold has historically preserved purchasing power with stability, it offers limited performance. Bitcoin, in contrast, can be seen as a leveraged version of gold for those who believe in its store-of-value potential.

“Over the past 15 years, Bitcoin has consistently increased in value against fiat currencies, albeit with higher volatility. Investors who accept the possibility of short-term drawdowns have found Bitcoin to be an extremely valuable mid- to long-term investment,” he told BeInCrypto.

Uniswap Labs Supercharges Gaming Portfolio With Acquisition Of 'Crypto: The Game' - Details | Bitcoinist.com


								Uniswap Labs made a significant move into the blockchain gaming industry with its recent acquisition of ‘Crypto: The Game’ (CTG), an on-chain survival game. 
Notably, the second season of CTG witnessed unprecedented success, with all 800 available spots selling out within a mere 13 minutes. Recognizing the game’s popularity among both the core crypto community and outsiders, Uniswap Labs announced the acquisition on Monday.
Uniswap Labs And CTG Founders Team Up
In a statement to Fortune, Mary-Catherine Lader, Chief Operating Officer at Uniswap Labs, expressed excitement about the acquisition, saying, We’ve seen CTG generate a ton of excitement, and Uniswap is focused on making on-chain experiences more human and fun.” While the exact purchase amount remains undisclosed, it involves a combination of cash, tokens, and equity.

Under the terms of the acquisition, the founders of CTG, Dylan Abruscato, Tyler Cagle, and Bryan Lee, will join the Uniswap team. Together, they are currently collaborating on the development of season three while exploring new interactive crypto experiences for consumers. 
Importantly, the game will not simply become a promotional platform for Uniswap’s wallet or exchange, as clarified by the companies during a conference call.
Dylan Abruscato, co-founder of Crypto The Game, expressed enthusiasm about the support from Uniswap Labs, stating, “Now we have the full force of Uniswap Labs behind us, we think that’s going to help us make season three the best one yet.” 
Convergence Of Gaming And Crypto Communities?
Inspired by popular TV shows like Survivor and Squid Game, CTG’s first two seasons followed a format where contestants purchased 0.1 Ethereum (ETH) (approximately $367) to join one of ten tribes consisting of 80 players. 
Over the course of ten days, participants engaged in daily challenges voted each other out and ultimately competed for a grand prize. Season one saw a Japanese player claim a pot of over $150,000, while the prize pool grew to around $250,000 in season two.
Uniswap Labs sponsored a challenge during season two, joining forces with partners such as Adidas and Wormhole. This sponsorship reportedly provided Uniswap with valuable insights into the game’s ability to attract new users to the world of crypto. 
According to Fortune Magazine, CTG has gained a “cult-like” following within the crypto community, with enthusiasts closely following the game’s developments through various platforms, including podcasts and media outlets.

Dylan Abruscato emphasized the diverse fan base of CTG, which comprises crypto Twitter enthusiasts, venture capitalists, founders, and influential figures like 3LAU, Packy McCormick, Jesse Pollak, and Bored Elon. 
Significantly, the game has also managed to captivate “normies” (individuals new to crypto) who make up about 10%–15% of the audience, presenting an opportunity to onboard new users into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).
Although the precise number of viewers during the previous season remains unknown, CTG recorded approximately 50,000 unique visitors to its website over the ten-day gameplay period. 
Dylan Abruscato described the game as a “24/7 crypto reality show” with villain arcs, drama, and fan favorites, which has become a spectacle within the crypto community.

Currently, the UNI token is trading at $10.29, showcasing a significant 4.5% price increase subsequent to the announcement of the acquisition. 
Moreover, the token has experienced a remarkable 7% surge in the past week alone, contributing to its overall upward trend observed over the last month, which has resulted in an impressive 45% price increase.

How Unisat's PIZZA airdrop skyrocketed its on-chain activity - AMBCrypto



Unisat saw spikes in some key on-chain metrics.
The platform has concluded its Pizza airdrop.

Analysis showed that Unisat, Bitcoin service provider known for its Ordinals marketplace, experienced a spike in several on-chain metrics, including volume, transactions, and users lately. 
This surge was attributed to the recently concluded PIZZA airdrop, which significantly increased activity on the platform.
Unisat sets volume record
An analysis of marketplaces on the Bitcoin network showed that Unisat has recently experienced a spike in some key metrics. 
A study of the volume on Dune Analytics revealed that it has been growing steadily over the past few days, with a significant increase on 9th June. 
The chart showed that the platform recorded over $4.5 million in volume that day, marking its all-time high (ATH). 
Furthermore, this was the highest daily volume recorded on any platform on 9th June.
Source: Dune Analytics
Additionally, an analysis of the number of transactions showed consistent growth. 
The chart indicated that the number of transactions surpassed 8,000 as of this writing, marking an all-time high (ATH). Similar to the volume, this number was also the highest recorded on any platform.
Further analysis revealed that with the spike in volume, Unisat controlled over 48% of the marketplace’s total volume. Additionally, its share of the transactions was over 50%.
Unisat records ATH in users
Despite the surge in volume and transactions, data showed that the cumulative unique users on Unisat were still behind other major platforms.
 As of this writing, the number of unique users was around 125,000. While this is relatively low compared to other platforms, it represents an increase from previous weeks.
The change in the number of users became more evident in the daily user statistics.
 Analysis of the data showed that the number of unique daily users spiked to a new high, surpassing 9,500. This was the highest number Unisat has ever seen. 
It was also the highest among the other platforms. The closest competitor had around 6,000 daily users.
Pizza airdrop contributes to spike in metrics
The primary reason for the spike Unisat saw in these metrics was its Pizza airdrop. 
A few months ago, the platform announced the airdrop of its token, PIZZA. According to its post on 9th June, all the PIZZA tokens have been airdropped to addresses that claimed them.

Mark Cuban Says Crypto Could Tip The Scale In Favor Of Trump In 2024 Election Despite Ex-President's Questionable Knowledge: 'Do You Really Think He Understands Anything' - Benzinga

Billionaire and prominent television celebrity, Mark Cuban, has hinted that the 2024 presidential race could be swayed by the influence of cryptocurrency, potentially favoring Donald Trump over Joe Biden.What Happened: Cuban voiced concerns about both Biden’s and Trump’s grasp of cryptocurrency, The Block reported Monday. Despite the former president’s $14 million portfolio, Cuban was unimpressed and remarked, “Do you really think he understands anything about crypto? Beyond saying he made money selling NFTs?”However, he alluded to the fact that the recent pro-cryptocurrency speech by the Republican candidate could prove to be a game-changer in the forthcoming election.Cuban reiterated his earlier stance that Biden’s allegiance to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler might cost him the presidency.Why It Matters: A long-term cryptocurrency investor, Cuban has previously expressed concerns about the SEC’s anti-crypto stance under Biden’s administration. He said that the cryptocurrency vote, particularly from younger and independent voters, could be pivotal in the election outcome.Meanwhile, Trump has declared himself the “crypto president” after raising $12 million at a San Francisco fundraiser, criticizing Democrats’ attempts to regulate the industry.With cryptocurrency becoming a key issue for up to 20% of swing state voters, the mouth-watering contest between Biden and Trump could have significant implications for the digital asset market. Analysts at Standard Chartered predict that Bitcoin could reach as high as $150,000 in the event of a Trump victory.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $67,882.06, retracing 2.42% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Photo by Kathy Hutchins on ShutterstockRead Next: GameStop Could Start ‘Biggest Bitcoin Adoption Story Of The Year’ With This Move, Trader SuggestsDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

Ethereum Price Downward Drift: Decline Resumes Again


																Ethereum price failed to clear the $3,720 resistance. ETH declined again and is now at risk of more losses below the $3,550 support zone.

Ethereum started a fresh decline from the $3,720 resistance zone.
The price is trading below $3,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,680 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).
The pair could extend losses if there is a close below the $3,550 support.

Ethereum Price Dips Again
Ethereum price attempted a decent increase above the $3,650 resistance zone. ETH even spiked above $3,700 but the bears were active. A high was formed at $3,710 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a sharp decline below the $3,660 and $3,650 levels.
A low was formed near $3,565 and the price is now consolidating losses, like Bitcoin. Ethereum is now trading below $3,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
If there is a fresh increase or a recovery wave, the price might face resistance near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,710 swing high to the $3,565 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,640 level.
There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,680 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,710 swing high to the $3,565 low.
Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com
An upside break above the $3,680 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance sits at $3,720, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,750 level. If the bulls push Ether above the $3,750 level, the price might rise and test the $3,800 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,880 resistance zone.
More Losses In ETH?
If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,650 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near $3,550. The next major support is near the $3,520 zone.
The main support sits at $3,500. A clear move below the $3,500 support might push the price toward $3,320. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,250 level in the near term.

            US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen their first outflows after a 19-day streak of inflows, according to data from HODL15Capital.On Monday, the ETFs experienced approximately $65 million in outflows, with Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) reporting nearly $40 million in withdrawals.Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) faced outflows of $3 million. Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) saw a substantial $20.5 million leave its fund. Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) reported nearly $16 million in outflows.In contrast, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) saw almost $8 million in net inflows while BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded around $6 million in inflows.Other funds, including ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Franklin Templeton Bitcoin ETF (EZBC), VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL), and WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin (BTCW), reported no activity in terms of inflows or outflows during the day’s trading session.US Bitcoin funds have been active buyers, accumulating approximately 25,700 BTC in the first week of June alone. IBIT remains the largest Bitcoin ETF globally, with over 304,000 BTC under management, while GBTC holds the second position with over 284,000 BTC, valued at $19.7 billion.US economic sentiment and anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) monetary policy may have influenced Monday’s ETF flows.All eyes are on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, both scheduled for Wednesday, June 12.

Bitcoin ETF Inflow Streak Ends After 19 Days, but June's Opening Week Rivaled May's Total


																Despite hints of waning hype, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs, including GBTC, had a strong start to June. During the first week alone, these ETFs collectively purchased 25,729 BTC.
Data also shows that in January, these ETFs acquired 33,456 BTC, followed by 116,561 BTC in February and 65,456 in March. April, on the other hand, saw an outflow of 6,074 BTC. The figure subsequently recovered in May when it recorded 25,729 BTC.
Interestingly, the amount of bitcoins purchased by these investment vehicles in the first week of June was recorded to be almost as much as the entire month of May, as per the data shared by HODL15Capital.
Since their launch in mid-January, these spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted a total of almost $15.7 billion in net inflows from investors. This figure also includes the $17.93 billion in net outflows experienced by Grayscale’s GBTC during the same period.
These 11 ETFs collectively manage more than $61 billion in total assets under management (AUM) with BlackRock and Fidelity in the lead in the US.
Moreover, the US-based spot ETFs were on a spectacular streak of 19 consecutive days, with only inflows. However, that record came to an end exactly a month after it started.
Farside data shows that the ETFs had $64.9 million taken out on June 10. As expected, the biggest loser was Grayscale’s GBTC, which saw nearly $40 million taken out. IBIT and BITB were among the few that actually saw minor inflows.
Interestingly, bitcoin’s price started to tumble in the past 12 hours amid the outflows from the ETFs. The asset went from just over $70,000 to under $68,000 in hours, leaving $170 million in liquidations and dragging the entire market with it.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Dumps Below $68K in Minutes, Liquidating Over 75K Traders


																Bitcoin’s price tried to take down the coveted $70,000 level last night but was violently rejected and pushed back down by over two grand in an hour or so.
The altcoins have also turned red, triggering an $80 billion loss to the total crypto market cap. The total value of liquidated positions has risen to roughly $170 million on a daily scale.
CryptoPotato reported yesterday that BTC’s price actions were quite dull during the weekend, but Monday began on a more positive note. The afternoon was even more bullish for the asset as it attempted a charge against the psychological resistance at $70,000.
Despite briefly breaching that level, the bears were quick to intercept the move and didn’t allow a decisive victory. Just the opposite, BTC started losing value almost immediately and dumped by over two grand within an hour or so.
This culminated in a price drop to its lowest level since June 3 of $67,500. Its market cap has also plummeted to $1.335 trillion on CG.

The alternative coins are in an even worse state. Ethereum has lost 3.5% on the day and is down to $3.560. Similar declines are evident from SOL, DOGE, TON, SHIB, and LINK.
Binance Coin, which was last week’s top performer, has dumped by more than 7% in the past 24 hours. As a result, BNB is down to under $620.
Even more painful declines come from the likes of NOT (-19%), W (-15%), JASMY (-11%), BRETT (-10%), and others.
The total value of liquidated positions in the past 12 hours is up to $120 million and $170 million on a daily scale. More than 75,000 traders have been wrecked within the same timeframe.
Interestingly, ETH is responsible for the largest piece of the pie and the single-biggest liquidated position involved ether as well. It was worth more than $6.5 million and took place on Binance.

Celestia's Blobstream goes live on Ethereum mainnet - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Modular blockchain network Celestia has launched its data availability solution, Blobstream, on the Ethereum mainnet, according to the team’s announcement on Monday.Developed by Succinct Labs, Blobstream enables Celestia’s data roots to be streamed to an Ethereum light client on-chain. The solution offers high-throughput data availability (DA) for Ethereum layer 2 solutions (L2s), secured by cryptoeconomic guarantees.“This provides permissionless, high-throughput DA to Ethereum L2s, secured by cryptoeconomic guarantees rather than reputation or hidden trust assumptions,” stated Celestia.Previously, Ethereum developers faced throughput limitations, prompting them to move to alternative layer 1 networks or rely on centralized services for DA.Blobstream allows developers to continue their work within the Ethereum ecosystem. Builders can create customizable, high-throughput blockspace without the need for permissions or committees while ensuring security through cryptographic economic guarantees.Apart from the launch, the Celestia team announced that Blobstream on the Ethereum mainnet is now accessible on Celestia’s blockchain explorer Celenium.According to Celestia’s blog announcement, Succinct Labs has introduced Blobstream X, a zero-knowledge (ZK) implementation that streamlines the verification of Celestia validator signatures on-chain with a single ZK proof. This reduces validator overhead, simplifies the Celestia protocol, and accelerates the streaming of data root commitments for Ethereum L2s.As noted, both Blobstream and its ZK implementation are currently available on testnet. Following code audits and Celestia’s upcoming launch, the community will be able to deploy Blobstream on Ethereum Mainnet and L2s to enhance streaming DA.Prior to this deployment, Celestia had already brought Blobstream to Arbitrum Orbit, Starknet, and Base, marking a continuous commitment to improving the Ethereum ecosystem’s infrastructure.

'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Robert Kiyosaki Says Bitcoin Is The Simplest Way To Become A Millionaire: 'Does The Hardwork For Me' - Benzinga

World-renowned author and investor Robert Kiyosaki feels that Bitcoin BTC/USD is the simplest path to becoming a millionaire, emphasizing its potential over entrepreneurship.What Happened: On Monday, Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” took to X to give another aggrandizing take on the world’s most popular digital asset. He stated, “Bitcoin is the easiest way to become a millionaire. Making millions as an entrepreneur is hard. I know.” Kiyosaki highlighted the obvious obstacles to starting a business and the high levels of intelligence and hard work required, in addition to sheer luck, to make it succeed.To the contrary, he remarked that Bitcoin avoids all these hassles, which is why he holds them. As of this writing, about 115,824 wallets have more than a million in Bitcoin, according to data from BitInfoCharts.Why It Matters: This isn’t the first time Kiyosaki has made bold statements about Bitcoin.Last week, he made a staggering prediction that Bitcoin would reach $350,000 by August 2024, a nearly fivefold jump in less than three months.Earlier this year, he predicted that Bitcoin would hit $100,000 by June 2024. Going by the asset’s ongoing trajectory, the prognosis can be safely put to rest.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $67,930.16, slipping 2.37% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Photo Courtesy: Shutterstock.comRead Next: Mark Cuban Says Crypto Could Tip The Scale In Favor Of Trump In 2024 Election Despite Ex-President’s Questionable Knowledge: ‘Do You Really Think He Understands Anything’Disclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

Tucker Carlson Wants Bitcoin, Selects Swan As Lead Sponsor


								Swan Bitcoin has been named the lead sponsor for Tucker Carlson’s highly anticipated national tour. This partnership marries political discourse with Bitcoin education, setting the stage for a broad engagement on the benefits and implications of BTC.
Swan, renowned for its Bitcoin-only focus, views the sponsorship as a strategic move to extend its educational initiatives. “This is a massive opportunity for Bitcoin education,” the company announced, planning to reach hundreds of thousands of people in over 15 cities and potentially millions online through their comprehensive educational offerings.
Is Tucker Carlson A Bitcoiner?
Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan, elaborated on the decision to partner with Carlson, emphasizing the selective approach taken by Carlson’s team. “Swan’s sponsorship of Tucker Carlson’s Live Tour is a massive opportunity to discuss how BTC can help fix some of the world’s most pressing problems with hundreds of thousands of people across the country,” Klippsten stated via X. He added, “To their credit, the Tucker Carlson Network team had the vision and conviction to seek sponsorship from a Bitcoin-only company, not a crypto company, and their search quickly led to Swan.”

Carlson’s production company approached Swan due to its prominent role in the sector and its commitment to educating the public about the cryptocurrency. “We see Bitcoin as an idea that will unite people and we want to facilitate discourse across the political spectrum toward this end,” Swan noted on X. They underscored Bitcoin’s potential to protect against inflation, empower individuals in authoritarian regimes, and support sustainable energy through its mining processes.
The tour, which will precede the 2024 presidential election, aims to engage attendees in live discussions with some of the nation’s top political voices. Notable speakers will include Tulsi Gabbard and Vivek Ramaswamy, both of whom have publicly supported BTC and criticized central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).


Carlson, whose platform includes 12.9 million followers on his X account, has already demonstrated significant reach and influence in political and financial discourse. His recent interactions on the platform have garnered substantial engagement, indicating a wide and attentive audience for the topics discussed during the upcoming tour.
Swan’s partnership with Carlson aligns with the journalist’s previous engagements with prominent Bitcoin advocates, including interviews with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele and MicroStrategy’s executive chairman Michael Saylor. These individuals are known for their staunch support of BTC, which echoes Swan’s Bitcoin-centric philosophy.

“As a former broadcast journalist and long-time online media executive and investor, I’ve been incredibly impressed with the metamorphosis of Tucker’s brand into one of the most powerful voices in independent media,” Klippsten expressed, underlining the synergy between Carlson’s transformation and Swan’s mission.
The collaboration has not been without its critics. Some online commentators have voiced concerns that Swan’s sponsorship might position the firm as leaning towards conservative political ideologies, reflecting Carlson’s own reputed stance. The debate reflects the broader political landscape where Bitcoin policies and legislations, such as recent actions by President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, often fall along partisan lines.
Despite these concerns, Swan remains focused on the educational impact of their involvement, believing in Bitcoin’s ability to transcend traditional political divisions. The sponsorship marks another major step to bring Bitcoin to the masses, with Tucker Carlson being one of the world’s most famous journalists. “Crypto casinos have muddied the media landscape for years. It’s time for Bitcoin to shine through, and we’re proud to support the mission,” Klippsten concluded.
At press time, BTC traded at $68,096.

Crypto Alert: XRP Price at Risk of Significant Downturn


																XRP price failed to recover above the $0.5050 resistance zone. The price is now moving lower and might gain bearish momentum below the $0.480 support.

XRP is gaining bearish momentum below the $0.500 support.
The price is now trading below $0.500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $0.4950 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair could decline heavily if it breaks the $0.480 support zone.

XRP Price Breaks Support
XRP price attempted a recovery wave above $0.4920 like Ethereum and Bitcoin. The price climbed above the $0.500 resistance zone, but the bears were active near $0.5050.
A high was formed at $0.5053 and the price is again moving lower. There was a move below the $0.4980 and $0.4950 support levels. The price traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $0.4533 swing low to the $0.5053 high.

However, it is still trading below $0.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.4920 level. The first key resistance is near $0.4950. The next major resistance is near the $0.500 level.
Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com
A close above the $0.500 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.5050. If there is a close above the $0.5050 resistance level, there could be a steady increase toward the $0.5250 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5350 resistance.
More Losses?
If XRP fails to clear the $0.4950 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.480 level.
The next major support is at $0.4740. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.4740 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could decline and retest the $0.4550 support in the near term.

Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

Bitcoin Drops Below $68,000 Amid ETF Outflows After 19 Days


On early Tuesday, Bitcoin’s value dropped sharply to $67,900. This marked a decline of over 3.3% from its Monday peak of approximately $71,200. 
This downturn coincided with significant changes in the flow of funds within Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which switched to negative flows after 19 consecutive days of positive inflows.
Bitcoin’s Price Drops Causes Over $100 Million in Liquidations

According to data from Farside Investors, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) reported an outflow of $3 million. Similarly, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) saw an outflow of $20.5 million, and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) experienced a depletion of $15.8 million. 
The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) noted the largest outflow, with $39.5 million exiting the fund.
In contrast, BlackRock’s iShare Bitcoin Trust (IBTC) recorded an inflow of $6.3 million. Additionally, the Bitwise Bitcoin Fund (BITB) attracted $7.6 million on the same day.

Despite these gains, the total effect was a net outflow of $64.9 million across all ETFs. The last recorded net outflow day among Bitcoin ETFs was on May 10.
These shifts have significantly impacted fund balances and market stability, resulting in $101 million in crypto liquidations over the last 12 hours. Of this, $94.43 million were from long positions, while short trades saw liquidations amounting to $6.57 million.

Despite the recent volatility, prominent financial figures maintain a positive outlook on Bitcoin’s future. Robert Kiyosaki, author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” advocates for Bitcoin as a strategic path to wealth. 

“Making millions as an entrepreneur is hard. I know. You have to be really smart, dedicated, and lucky to become a millionaire starting your own business.  I save Bitcoin because Bitcoin does the hardwork for me. That is why I love Bitcoin,” Kiyosaki said.

SEC Reviews ProShares’ New Spot Ethereum ETF Filing


The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has added a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) application from asset manager ProShares.
This development came after ProShares filed a proposal to list and trade spot Ethereum ETF shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 6.
SEC Recognizes ProShares’ Spot Ethereum ETF Filing

In a June 10 filing, the SEC noted that NYSE Arca proposed a rule change to facilitate this listing. The public now has 21 days to comment on the application. Meanwhile, the SEC has 45 days to decide, potentially by late July 2024.
However, this acknowledgment does not equate to approval. It only indicates that the SEC has received and is reviewing the filing.

ProShares’ entry into the spot Ethereum ETF market follows several other potential issuers whose 19b-4 filings were approved in May 2024. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart commented on the timing of ProShares’ move.


“Instinct initially says this won’t launch on day 1 with the other ETFs whenever that is but who knows. This is interesting. […] It’s intriguing that ProShares is jumping in late though,” he said.

In another development, the SEC approved Ark Invest’s exit from a joint ETF application with 21Shares. This approval allows 21Shares to proceed independently. The SEC waived the usual 30-day delay, making the change effective immediately. The decision was based on the assessment that it does not significantly impact investor protection or competition.
Ark Invest and 21Shares announced their split on May 31. A newly amended S-1 form reveals that the spot Ethereum ETF will change its name from ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF to 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF.
A spokesperson from Ark Invest mentioned they would not proceed with an Ethereum ETF without providing a specific reason. However, Ark remains active with its spot Bitcoin ETF, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB).
Despite these developments, potential spot Ethereum ETF issuers are still awaiting feedback on their S-1 filings submitted on May 31. The SEC’s comments, initially expected by June 7, have yet to be received by at least two issuers.
A recent report reveals that issuers anticipate feedback this week. This update follows SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s remarks on CNBC that the approval process for S-1 forms would “take some time.”

The approval process for these ETFs involves two steps: the 19b-4 filing and the S-1 filing. The S-1 forms are currently under review. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas previously indicated that another round of fine-tuning comments from the SEC staff would likely precede the final approval.

Nevertheless, the acknowledgment of ProShares’ spot Ethereum ETF application and the approval of Ark Invest’s split from 21Shares represent significant progress in the crypto ETF sector. This highlights regulatory recognition and potential market expansion.

Bitcoin (BTC) Whales Open Massive Long Positions on Bybit and HTX: CryptoQuant CEO - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin (BTC) whales opened massive long positions on the digital asset exchanges Bybit and HTX, according to CryptoQuant chief executive Ki Young Ju.
Young Ju notes that the whales opened the long positions at $69,000.

Young Ju reminds his followers that Bitcoin whales also opened massive long positions in August 2023, just before a parabolic rally that sent BTC from $25,000 to above $73,000 in just a few months.
The analytics firm CEO also says that Bitcoin isn’t currently overvalued from a network fundamentals perspective. Young Ju cites BTC’s “thermo cap ratio” as evidence.
Thermo cap represents the weighted sum of mined coins by the creation price, indicating the total investment cost in the Bitcoin network. Young Ju says the thermo cap ratio is Bitcoin’s market capitalization divided by the thermo cap.

Earlier this month, Young Ju said that Bitcoin’s current price action is reminiscent of four years ago when BTC consolidated for over half a year while on-chain activity rose rapidly.
The CEO noted that $1 billion in BTC has been added to whale wallets, which he said is most likely headed off-market to cold storage.
“Same vibe on Bitcoin as mid-2020.
Back then, BTC hovered around $10,000 for six months with high on-chain activity, later revealed as OTC (over-the-counter) deals.
Now, despite low price volatility, on-chain activity remains high, with $1 billion added daily to new whale wallets, likely custody.”
BTC is trading at $68,124 at time of writing.

Why Ethereum Price is Struggling After $574 Million Accumulation?


Twelve new crypto wallets collectively withdrew 156,733 Ethereum (ETH), worth approximately $574 million, from Coinbase. This transaction occurred at an average price of $3,664 per ETH.
However, despite this accumulation, the price of Ethereum has been struggling.
Will Ethereum Price Drop 7%?

According to data from the on-chain analysis platform Spot On Chain, 11 of these 12 crypto wallets withdrew about 13,059 ETH. Notably, one crypto wallet – 0xdfa, withdrew a slightly higher amount, 13,084 ETH.
Concurrently, Ethereum’s availability on crypto exchanges has decreased significantly, reaching a seven-year low, as reported by the on-chain data from Glassnode. Lark Davis, an experienced crypto investor, shed light on this trend. 

“ETH supply on exchanges is at a 7-year low. Ethereum ETFs are about to cause a massive supply shock. As a result, the price of ETH could skyrocket,” Davis said.

The crypto community is abuzz with the recent US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. This development marks a crucial advancement for the crypto market. It opens the door to potential substantial investments, reflecting the early success seen with Bitcoin ETFs.
Prominent crypto researcher Bobby Banzai predicted monthly inflows of $569 million into Ethereum ETFs. His forecast is based on the performance of international ETFs and Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures data. 
Despite these positive developments and market optimism, the immediate price impact for Ethereum has been unfavorable. After the large withdrawals, Ethereum’s price has fallen over 4% from Monday’s highs, currently trading around $3,600. 
Spot On Chain suggested that the fresh wallets’ transactions could be part of over-the-counter (OTC) deals, as they did not affect the market price directly.
Analysis suggests a cautious short-term outlook for Ethereum, predicting a potential 7% correction from its current market price. Since May 20, Ethereum has been consolidating between $3,624 and $3,950. 

However, ETH faced challenges this Tuesday, trading at $3,551 and possibly breaking down from the established range. If this downward trend persists, Ethereum could find its next support level around $3,302.

The wider crypto market is also undergoing a correction phase. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has declined about 3%, BNB nearly 7%, and Solana 3.5%.

Canadian Firm DeFi Technologies Bets Big on Bitcoin


                                DeFi Technologies Bitcoin Treasury Move Ignites a Bullish Crypto Craze                                In an effort to integrate digital assets into the organization, a Canadian-based publicly listed company called DeFi Technologies has decided to make BTC its company’s treasury reserve currency. This strategic shift is in sync with the increasing trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies mainly Bitcoin which is on an upswing in the current years.What's the newsCanada-based DeFi Technologies, an exchange-traded product (ETP) issuer, and venture capital firm, said it plans to buy 110 Bitcoins (BTC) and use the funds to pay $5 million in debt owed by its subsidiary, Valour. In this announcement, Valour also revealed that is currently managing $607 million of assets as of 31st May 2024.Investors in DeFi Technologies were happy with the Bitcoin treasury strategy since the company’s share prices rose on the Canadian stock market and the US over-the-counter (OTC) markets. More importantly, at the time of writing this article, the DeFi Technologies shares are trading at a price of $1.57 on U.S. OTC exchanges, which is much higher than the trading range recorded in the previous session 1.16 to $1.40.Impact of Bitcoin Treasury StrategyThis move by DeFi Technologies to adopt Bitcoin as the firm’s treasury reserve is evidence of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. This move is similar to what other public trading companies like Semler Scientific, trading under the ticker SMLR+ have recently done, where the firm has announced it will be using Bitcoin as its reserve currency and has bought 581 BTC at the time worth $41 million.Furthermore, the government institutions are also interested in Bitcoin, as an instrument of investment in their portfolios and treasury. For instance, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB), Wisconsin’s pension fund manager has recently revealed that it has invested $164 million in Bitcoin ETFs.In addition, the pension fund in Japan, the Japanese Government Pension Investment Fund, is the largest in the world. It has commenced a five-year research program aimed at assessing the possibility of incorporating both digital currencies such as Bitcoin and physical bullion such as gold into its investment mix.ConclusionIt is for this reason that DeFi Technologies and other institutional players are beginning to hold the decentralized currency as a treasury reserve asset. Given the increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin, the demand for Bitcoin ETFs has also grown, and recent data from HODL15 Capital reveals that Bitcoin ETFs have already received two months’ worth of BTC mined in the first week of June. This development goes further in revealing the increasing mainstream adoption of Bitcoin as a currency.Also Read: Solana Toward Mainnet Upgrade, A Lift For Network Efficiency

Remarks by Billionaire Mark Cuban - Is the Fate of the US in the Hands of the Cryptocurrency Community? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban recently commented on the potential impact of cryptocurrencies on the 2024 US presidential election, suggesting that former President Donald Trump may have an advantage over incumbent President Joe Biden due to his stance on crypto regulations.
Cuban noted the important role of cryptocurrencies in the upcoming elections, especially in light of President Biden's loyalty to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler.


While Cuban expressed doubt that Biden or Trump fully understand cryptocurrencies despite Trump's NFT-related fundraising efforts, he said crypto fan votes could be a crucial factor differentiating the candidates.

“I have said many times that Biden must choose between Gensler or crypto voters or it could cost him the White House,” Cuban said in a statement on social media platform X. “As for who will be appointed, nothing is certain I don't see it as such.”





Cuban criticized Gensler's tenure, arguing that the SEC Chairman has failed to protect investors from fraud and made it “nearly impossible” for cryptocurrency firms to operate. “Crypto voters will make their voices heard in this election,” Cuban said.

Cardano's Chang Fork: Entering the Age of Voltaire | Cryptoglobe


                                
Charles Hoskinson, the visionary behind the Cardano blockchain platform, has announced a significant milestone for the Cardano ecosystem. On June 9, Hoskinson revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that the much-anticipated Chang fork is on the horizon, with the Cardano Node expected to reach version 9.0 this month.



Cardano’s Chang hard fork represents a significant upgrade, marking the start of the Voltaire era, the final phase of Cardano’s roadmap. This phase is dedicated to establishing decentralized governance and on-chain voting mechanisms on the Cardano blockchain.



The significance of the Chang hard fork lies in its ability to give the Cardano community a voice in the blockchain’s future development and direction through a comprehensive voting and treasury system. This allows ADA holders to utilize their tokens to vote on various proposals, thereby influencing key decisions and ensuring community participation in governance.



Among the major features and benefits of the Chang hard fork is the shift to decentralized governance, transferring control from the development team to the broader Cardano community. It also introduces on-chain voting, enabling ADA holders to directly vote on proposals on the blockchain. Additionally, a treasury system will be established to fund future development and community-led projects. Enhanced security measures will also be implemented to improve the overall resilience and safety of the Cardano network.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The Cardano blockchain, now primed for this hard fork, awaits 70% of its stake pool operators (SPOs) to update to the new node version. Once this threshold is achieved, the network will undergo the Chang hard fork, transitioning Cardano into the Age of Voltaire.



Named in memory of Phil Chang, a pioneering figure in Cardano governance who passed away in 2022, this hard fork is deemed by Hoskinson as a monumental milestone. He envisions it as a step towards creating a “decentralized civilization spanning the entire world with millions of residents.”



Hoskinson anticipates that with the Chang fork, Cardano will boast the “most advanced blockchain governance system,” complete with annual budgets, a treasury, and enriched community insights. Reflecting on the decade-long journey of Cardano’s development, he expressed pride in the community’s achievements and optimism for the future. “Cardano gives me hope for our industry and the world. Let’s spend the next decade making a big dent in the universe,” Hoskinson remarked.



At the time of writing, Crdano’s ADA token is trading at around $0.4333, down 1.7% in the past 24-hour period.

ZKSync to airdrop 17.5% of ZK token supply to 695K wallets - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            ZKSync, an Ethereum-based Layer 2 network developed by Matter Labs, is gearing up for its highly anticipated ZK token airdrop. According to the distribution plan released Tuesday, 17.5% of the total 21 billion ZK token supply will be airdropped to users starting next week.The ZK airdrop is set to be the largest token distribution among major Layer 2 networks, with nearly 3.7 billion tokens allocated to users. Pre-market pricing from perpetuals exchange Aevo values ZK at $0.66, placing the airdrop’s fully diluted value (FDV) above $2.5 billion. On PancakeSwap, the token is averaging at roughly $0.7. For context, this most recent airdrop valuation is roughly three times the total value locked in the ZKSync Era. Current market capitalization for the token is estimated at roughly $14.9 billion.The project has allocated two-thirds of the ZK token supply to its community, with the majority (89%) of the airdropped tokens going to users who interacted with the ZKSync Era or ZKSync Lite networks before the March 24 snapshot date. The remaining 11% will be distributed to native projects and communities.To protect against Sybil attacks, ZKSync has set seven eligibility criteria, including interacting with ten smart contracts, trading ten ERC-20 tokens, or depositing liquidity into a DeFi protocol. The airdrop to each wallet is capped at 100,000 tokens. According to a press release from ZKSync, token holders will be able to immediately participate in the protocol’s governance once they claim their tokens.ZKSync claims that awarding more tokens to the community through the airdrop than to the Matter Labs team and investors is more than just a symbolic decision.
“A wallet’s onchain history reveals a lot about its owner habits. Real people tend to be risk-on, especially the ones that feel like a part of a community. They spend time onchain, ape in, transact, try new protocols, and hold speculative assets. Bots and opportunists are the opposite. Bots take fewer risks with minimal effort while trying to blend into the community and extract value from it,” a ZKNation blog post stated.
Less than 0.5% of the total supply will also be airdropped to various NFT and token communities, including Crypto: The Game players, Pudgy Penguins and Milady Maker NFT holders, and DEGEN and BONSAI airdrop recipients.The remaining one-third of the ZK token supply is set to be divided almost evenly between investors and the ZKSync development team, Matter Labs, with tokens unlocking over a three-year period from June 2025 to 2028. Matter Labs recently faced backlash for attempting to trademark zero knowledge, an initiative which it subsequently dropped. The protocol developer also recently introduced ZKNation, its new decentralized governance system.

R. Kiyosaki reveals 'the easiest way to become a millionaire'


    Days after predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) could hit $350,000 by the end of August 2024, popular investor and finance author Robert Kiyosaki shared his view that the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset was the best way to turn someone into a millionaire.



Specifically, Kiyosaki pointed out that making millions as an entrepreneur was difficult, as “you have to be really smart, dedicated, and lucky to become a millionaire starting your own business,” whereas Bitcoin “does the hardwork for me,” as he explained in an X post on June 11.







Indeed, it is no secret that the renowned investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ is a major fan of Bitcoin who believes that the maiden cryptocurrency will go “through the roof,” agreeing with Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood that one day it could hit the price of $2.3 million.















Furthermore, he has opined that Bitcoin was one of the best ways to safeguard one’s wealth against the “Marxists” in the American government, who control the “fake money,” a.k.a the United States dollar, but has also expressed belief in the future success of other crypto assets, like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL).



On top of that, Kiyosaki has long advised his followers on X (formerly Twitter) to accumulate precious metals gold and silver in the face of inflation, mounting debt, and market instability, as well as the ‘everything bubble’ that encompassed traditional financial products like stocks and bonds.



Meanwhile, Kiyosaki’s favorite digital asset was at press time changing hands at the price of $67,761, recording a drop of 2.31% on the day, declining 1.75% across the week while advancing 11.51% in the past month, and accumulating a gain of 64.68% since the year’s turn, as per recent data on June 11.

XRP gains 100K holders in June: What does it mean for prices? - AMBCrypto



The number of XRP holders increased by 100,000 within the first 10 days of June.
Despite the growth, XRP might keep swinging between $0.48 and $0.52.

Things might have changed for Ripple [XRP] in ways most market participants could find surprising. On the last day of May, the total number of XRP holders was 5.2 million.
However, within the first week of June, the number has increased by another 100,000. This implies growing demand for the token despite the underwhelming price action.
At press time, XRP’s price was $0.50, representing a 3.65% decrease in the last seven days. Considering the recent growth, it is likely that the cryptocurrency could be in line for a hike.
Source: Santiment
From doubt to belief
Recently, several analyses have shown that XRP could be heading for a decrease. But if the current state of things is anything to by, the bearish prediction could be invalidated.
While this opinion might be valid, it is important to analyze other metrics. One of the metrics considered was the Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA).
The MDIA shows the average age all XRP holders have held their coins. When the metric decreases, it means an increase in transactions activity. In most cases, this causes the price to decrease.
However, a rising line of the MDIA indicates that long-term holders are refraining from selling. For XRP, the 90-day MDIA was down to 1812 on the 1st of June.
But as of this writing, the figures had approached 2000, indicating that most holders tilted toward the latter. Going forward, if this number rises, the price might follow, and a target of $0.55 could be feasible.
Another metric supporting the bullish prediction was the circulation. Circulation shows the number of token engaged in transaction within a given period.
At press time, the one-day XRP circulation was down to 228.53 million. An increase in the metric would have suggested a possible increase in selling pressure.
Source: Santiment
Will XRP sales continue to fall?
Therefore, the decline in circulation meant that most holders are not realizing profits or settling for losses. Should this continue, the value of XRP might experience a notable rally.
Despite the bullish bias, the Weighted Sentiment was down to -1.186. Weighted Sentiment measures the positive or negative commentary about an asset.
When the metric is positive, it means that most comments online are positive. However, a negative sentiment, like it was in XRP’s case implied that market participants are bearish on the token.
Should this perception linger, XRP might find it hard to sustain demand.
Source: Santiment

Realistic or not, here’s XRP’s market cap in BTC terms

If this is the case, XRP might move sideways, and the price could move between $0.48 and a ceiling of $0.52.
Meanwhile, Network Growth on the XRP Ledger have remained flat. This indicates that new addresses on the network are not participating in transaction.

19-Day Entry Streak Breaks in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs! Bitcoin Has Come to Decline! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

11 US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a net outflow of $64.93 million on Monday, marking the end of a 19-day streak of inflows, the longest on record. This series saw total inflows of over 4 billion dollars.
US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Experience $65 Million Net Outflow, Ending 19-Day Inflow Streak
Grayscale's GBTC led this week's outflows, withdrawing $40 million. Among other significant redemptions, Invesco and Galaxy Digital's BTCO experienced net outflows of $20 million, according to SosoValue data.


Valkyrie's Bitcoin ETF reported a net outflow of $16 million, while Fidelity's FBTC saw a net outflow of $3 million, its first negative flow since May 2.
In comparison, BlackRock's IBIT, the largest spot Bitcoin ETF by net assets, recorded net inflows of $6 million, while Bitwise's BITB saw inflows of $8 million.





The 19-day strong inflow series, which ended last Friday, provided net inflows of over $4 billion. Since their inception in January, 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded a combined net inflow of $15.62 billion.

Bitcoin's price fell last Friday after mixed signals from U.S. nonfarm payrolls and unemployment data created uncertainty and prompted investors to move away from riskier assets, according to crypto trading firm QCP Capital.


Market participants are closely monitoring the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Federal Open Market Committee meeting scheduled for later this week.
CME Group estimates there is a 99.4% chance that the Federal Reserve will keep the current interest rate between 5.25% and 5.50%.





However, a Reuters poll of economists shows that the Fed may cut interest rates twice this year, starting in September.

The threat was made in response to “seeing the headlines,” indicating a possible trigger for the action.



The statement includes a warning, “Don’t make me,” suggesting a level of seriousness in the threat.




Tensions flared after popular retail investor Keith Gill, a.k.a. “Roaring Kitty,” issued a veiled threat during his latest livestream. Pointing at the E*TRADE logo, he stated, “Don’t make me…” 



Sources report E*TRADE was considering removing Gill from its platform due to concerns over potential stock manipulation, following headlines about the move. Just weeks ago, Gill’s public disclosure of his holdings in Gamestop (GME) ignited a social media frenzy, sending the price of the meme stock soaring.









Gill, a central figure in the 2021 “meme stock” phenomenon, famously challenged institutional investors shorting GameStop. However, his latest moves caught the attention of market observers who delved into the implications for the broader market. The extreme volatility of GME may have also prompted some brokerage platforms, E*Trade, to consider delisting him. 



Amidst this, Gill’s reaction took many by surprise. Others believed that the threat might have been a form of protest or a statement against E*TRADE.







It is important to note that E*TRADE has not yet responded to the matter. Meanwhile, Roaring Kitty’s actions have brought renewed scrutiny to narrative-driven altcoins and their long-term viability. Still, many have defended RoaringKitty, citing his past contributions to the retail trading community.Whether E*TRADE will act on Gill’s statement remains uncertain. Market experts have cautioned against FOMO amidst Gamestop’s rollercoaster ride.

ZkSync to distribute 21 billion ZK tokens - Blockworks


The developers of Ethereum layer-2 zkSync Era and the ZK Stack, are preparing to airdrop a token: ZK
Following in the footsteps of dozens of protocols, the team at Matter Labs has looked to avoid some of the pitfalls that have tripped up competitors in the public’s eye.
For starters, the scale: Two-thirds allocated to community distribution, including a 17.5% allocation for an airdrop.
 “A 17.5% airdrop to 695,232 wallets is the largest distribution of tokens to users amongst major L2s,” Matter Labs said in a blog post.
All airdropped tokens will be unlocked and transferable from day one, with no vesting period. That had been a point of contention following EigenLayer’s EIGEN token release, for example.

The rest of the community allocation are to be administered by the ZKsync Foundation and an onchain governance process dubbed ZK Nation.
The remaining one-third of the 21 billion total ZK will go to investors and the Matter Labs team, over a four-year vesting period with a one-year cliff. That means no team and investor tokens should be expected to hit the market en masse until June 2025.
Previously, StarkWare postponed its team unlock date in response to criticism following the release of the STRK token in February.

“When the governance system launches in the coming weeks, the community will have the largest supply of liquid tokens to direct protocol governance upgrades,” Matter Labs said.
A wallet eligibility checker is now live and tokens are expected to be claimable sometime next week, and will remain so until January 3, 2025 — for those recipients who’s rather push their airdrop into the next tax year.
Gas fees are no issue, since zkSync’s native account abstraction makes claiming the tokens free.
Anti-Sybil measures
Matter Lab’s took a snapshot of all activity on ZKsync Era and its forerunner ZKsync Lite on March 24, 2024, the one-year anniversary of ZKsync Era mainnet launch, and is dolling out tokens to active, “risk-taking” and preferably human participants.
A combination of activity markers and multipliers have been used to calculate individual eligibility.

When all was said and done, the minimum allocation turned out to be 917 ZK, and Matter Labs set a max cap of 100,000 ZK.
Within the airdrop group, 11% will go to “individuals, developers, researchers, communities, and companies who contributed to the ZKsync ecosystem and protocol through development, advocacy or education, regardless of network usage,” and about 0.5% to “a small group of experimental onchain communities for exploring novel ways to organize using tokens and NFTs.”
Recipients of Farcaster tipping coin $DEGEN and Lens equivalent $BONSAI are among those, alongside Crypto the Game players and holders of NFTs from Pudgy Penguins and Milady collections.
Read more: Lens Network to migrate to zkSync
Matter Labs representatives said they were “quite proud of [the airdrop design],” calling it a “human-forward airdrop,” and noting that only about 1% of addresses that passed activity criteria needed to be filtered out based on Sybil markers.
Given the challenges of equitably eliminating bot-driven airdrop farms without penalizing normal users, “we erred on the side of conservatism,” Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchovski told Blockworks.
“If you’re a real user, you’ve been around, and are willing to take risk, it’s pretty easy to [qualify],” he said.

FOMC Preview: How Will Bitcoin And Crypto React?


																As the financial markets brace for the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday, June 12th, the Bitcoin and crypto community is poised to assess the implications of any Federal Reserve announcements on digital assets such as Bitcoin. With the consensus forecast suggesting that the Federal Reserve will hold the federal funds rate steady at 5.25%-5.50%, the primary interest of investors has turned to the nuances of the Fed’s forward guidance and economic projections.
Crypto analyst Tomo (@Market_Look) shared his insights on X, framing the upcoming FOMC meeting as a non-event for those expecting drastic moves. He stated, “Interest rates are likely to remain unchanged (5.25%-5.50%). There will likely not be any major changes to the statement or economic outlook, and the dot chart is expected to shift in a hawkish direction.”
Tomo also highlighted the anticipated adjustments in the rate projections for the coming years, noting, “In 2024, the rate will shift from 3 cuts to 2 cuts. The hawkish surprise will be 1 cut.” He explained that the market has already priced in these expected adjustments, suggesting minimal surprise and limited market volatility in response.

	Related Reading


“As of March, the distribution of dots for 2024 is 9 people in favor of keeping interest rates unchanged or cutting them twice, and 10 people in favor of cutting interest rates three or more times… a shift from three to two is already factored in.”
Banking giant ING’s team of economists, including James Knightley and Padhraic Garvey, CFA, share a similar conservative outlook on the Federal Reserve’s potential moves. They anticipate that the Fed will underscore its cautious stance due to persistent inflation and strong employment figures, potentially delaying rate cuts further into the future.
The ING team elaborated on their expectations, “The US Fed accepts that monetary policy is restrictive, but lingering inflation and strong jobs numbers mean it will indicate it’s prepared to wait longer before seriously considering interest rate cuts.”
They anticipate that the dot plot, which will reveal individual FOMC members’ rate predictions, will show a reduction in the number of projected rate cuts for 2024 from three to possibly one or two.
According to Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal, JPMorgan and Citigroup have withdrawn their predictions for a rate cut in July following the recent jobs report last Friday. Currently, the majority of sell-side economists and other experts monitoring the Federal Reserve anticipate one or two rate reductions in either September or December of this year.

Impact On Bitcoin And Crypto
Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have been quite sensitive to macro economic data recently. The anticipation of a dovish turn—particularly any hints of rate cuts—could weaken the dollar and bolster Bitcoin and other digital assets as alternative investments.

	Related Reading


Conversely, a reaffirmation of the current rate or a less dovish stance than expected could strengthen the dollar and apply downward pressure on crypto markets. However, the nuanced perspectives of FOMC members, as reflected in the dot plot and the accompanying economic projections, could provide clues about the medium-term trajectory of US monetary policy, which in turn could affect investor sentiment in the crypto markets.
A hawkish tilt, suggesting fewer or delayed rate cuts, might strengthen the US dollar and put downward pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, any dovish signals or indications of a softer stance on rate increases in the near future could buoy the crypto market.
During the FOMC press conference, Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks will be crucial for setting the tone and expectations. Market participants will closely analyze his comments for any shifts in tone regarding inflation, economic growth, and future monetary policy adjustments. The interpretation of these remarks could lead to significant price movements in the Bitcoin and crypto markets.
Moreover, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for May 2024 just hours before the FOMC meeting will be critical. These data points will provide essential context for the Fed’s decisions, influencing their assessment of whether the current policy stance remains appropriate.
At press time, BTC traded at $67,707, down -3.5% since yesterday’s high at $71,200.

If You Invested $1000 In Bitcoin When Apple CEO Tim Cook Said He Holds Crypto, Here's How Much It'd Be Worth Today - Benzinga

In a massive endorsement, Tim Cook, the CEO of one of the most valuable companies in the world, disclosed in late 2021 that he was exposed to cryptocurrencies. Since then, Bitcoin BTC/USD, the largest cryptocurrency, has broadly preserved its value despite a nasty bear market in between.What Happened: In an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook Conference, the Apple Inc. AAPL CEO confessed that he owned cryptocurrencies, though didn't specify which one or how much."I think it's reasonable to own it as part of a diversified portfolio," Cook said during the interview which came at the peak of the last bull cycle in November 2021.At that time, Bitcoin's price peaked at $69,000. This means that an investment of $1,000 would have fetched a person 0.014 units of Bitcoin. Unfortunately, the market entered into an extended bearish phase after this, causing Bitcoin's price to plummet as low as $16,000 in the fall of 2022. The bullish impulse was brought back by the hype and eventual listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This resulted in Bitcoin attaining an all-time high of $73,000 earlier this year. At the current price, 0.014 Bitcoin will amount to $952. While this is an obvious decline, bullish forecasts by several analysts by 2024-end raise hopes of better returns. Why It Matters: Bitcoin has gained traction as a store of value, akin to how traditional finance sees gold. Indeed, Bitcoin has grown by more than 7x in the last five years, and a staggering 158x in the last ten years, according to data from Benzinga Pro. In comparison, shares of Apple have risen 189% in the last five years, and 6x in the last ten.Photo courtesy: ShutterstockRead Next: ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ Author Robert Kiyosaki Says Bitcoin Is The Simplest Way To Become A Millionaire: ‘Does The Hardwork For Me’

Meme Coin Bloodbath: PEPE, FLOKI, and BRETT Among the Poorest Perfomers


																TL;DR

The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant correction on June 11, affecting both major digital assets and meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).
Beercoin (BEER) stood out by reaching an all-time high despite the downturn, highlighting the unpredictable and volatile nature of the sector.


Memes are Bleeding
The cryptocurrency market started the week on the right foot, recovering some losses that had been registered in the past several days. However, another severe correction occurred on June 11, with Bitcoin (BTC) plunging below $68,000 and Ethereum (ETH) dropping to almost $3,500.
The situation in the meme coin sector is no better. The leaders in terms of market capitalization – Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) – are down 3% each on a daily scale, while Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) witnessed more painful declines. 
The frog-themed Brett (BRETT), which was on a massive bull run in the past several days, headed south, too. Its price is currently hovering around $0.16, a 9% pullback in the past 24 hours but still a 33% weekly increase.




One of the few meme coins defying the negative market trend is Beercoin (BEER). Several hours ago, its value reached an all-time high of approximately $0.00057044. Currently, it trades at roughly $0.0004969, a whopping 450% spike on a 14-day basis.
BEER Price, Source: CoinGecko
ConstitutionDAO (PEOPLE), PONKE (PONKE), and Apu Apustaja (APU) are among the few other gainers, seeing minor price resurgence.
A Stark Warning for Investors
The meme coin sector is capable of spewing tokens that experience substantial price increases in a short period of time, thus benefiting savvy traders who enter the ecosystem in the early days. There are numerous examples of people who made millions (at least in paper profits) due to dealing with the asset class.
The latest pullback in the sector, though, should also serve as a major alert that jumping on the bandwagon can lead to crucial losses because of the enhanced volatility.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Support Shattered: Next Price Level Revealed

Shiba Inu has failed to hold the 100 EMA support level and has opened below it during this trading session. The fact that the price of the meme token is moving below this moving average raises substantial concerns and may be a negative signal for investors. The next support level for the asset is not far away but is located below a crucial resistance level.The Shiba Inu chart shows a bearish trend as it tries to stabilize above the 100 EMA. If selling pressure gets more intense, the price may approach the next major support at $0.000019, as indicated by the break below this support level.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewFor SHIB this area will be crucial because it has the potential to either provide a base for a rebound or, in the event that it is breached, to cause further declines. There are bearish signals being displayed by technical indicators such as the RSI. The fact that the RSI is currently in close proximity to the oversold area suggests that the selling pressure might continue.Nevertheless, if buyers intervene to take advantage of the lower prices, the oversold situation also creates the chance of a brief rebound. The volume profile indicates a decline in trading activity in comparison to earlier sessions. In a downtrend, lower volume usually signals waning buying interest, which may make it difficult for SHIB to stage a significant comeback anytime soon. A more pessimistic outlook for the meme token is further supported by the declining volume, which suggests that investors are distancing themselves from the token. A rebound may be imminent if SHIB is able to maintain this level and show signs of strength, suggesting that the worst of the selling may have passed.

EU regulation shakes up the stablecoin market - Crypto Valley Journal

A summarizing review of what has been happening at the crypto markets. A look at trending sectors, liquidity, volatility, spreads and more. The weekly report in cooperation with market data provider Kaiko.Bitcoin flirted with $72K before losing most of its gains after strong US jobs numbers cast doubt over rate cuts. In other news, the ECB made history, cutting rates before the US Fed, Robinhood acquired Bitstamp in a $200mn cash deal and Paxos launched a yield bearing stablecoin. This week we explore:The state of stablecoins ahead of MiCA's entry into force next monthBitstamp trade volumes and market shareBNB's hits record highCould MiCA be a boon for Euro stablecoins?Impending regulation in Europe is about to shake up the stablecoin market. Binance revealed plans to restrict stablecoins that don't meet the bloc's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) standards last week. Elsewhere, reports suggest Kraken has been actively reviewing which stablecoins meet the European Union's standards, potentially leading to delisting of non-compliant stablecoins for their EU users.While Europe has traditionally lagged the US and APAC when it comes to crypto trading, Euro-backed stablecoin's have consistently grown in volume since the beginning of the year, suggesting that demand is finally picking up in European markets.Stablecoin weekly trade volume / Source: KaikoThe combined weekly volume of Tether’s EURT, Stasis EURS, Société Générale’s EURCV, Anchored’s AEUR, and Circle’s EURCV has consistently exceeded $40 million since March, marking the longest period on record. AEUR, which had a bumpy launch on Binance back in December, has taken the EUR stablecoin market by storm and currently commands more than 50% of the total volume.Overall, USD-backed stablecoin continues to dominate the crypto market. Nearly 90% of all crypto transactions are executed using USD-backed stablecoins relative to the USD. Their average weekly volume in 2024 was $270bn which is 70 times higher than their EU counterparts. In contrast, just 1.1% of all transactions are done using Euro-backed stablecoins. However, it is notable that this share has increased from near zero in 2020 and is currently at an all-time high.USDT against EUR trading pairs are currently among the highest volume instruments exceeding EUR-denominated Bitcoin volume by a large margin on both Binance and Kraken. This suggests these exchanges are an important fiat off-ramp for EU traders.Exchanges are yet to share which stablecoin's will be considered unauthorised, but reports suggest Kraken has been reviewing whether or not to remove Tether's USDT.Tether's stablecoin, the largest in the world, has at times run foul of regulators. While its trade volume is mostly focused around US hours, with average hourly volumes peaking at over $1.5 billion during 1pm to 4pm UTC — or between 9am to 12pm EST — it's clearly still a crucial trading asset for European users. While OTC trading will continue to provide USDT-EUR liquidity, many traders could choose to rotate to regulated alternatives such as USDC.MicroStrategy outperforms despite arrival of BTC ETFsMicroStrategy's shares have surged by an impressive 132% this year, significantly outperforming Bitcoin and other BTC-exposed companies. This outperformance can be partly attributed to a short squeeze, but it is noteworthy given the competition from spot ETFs in the US which offer a convenient alternative to gain exposure to BTC.Tesla and the Block (SQ), which also hold BTC, have failed to benefit from the recent crypto rally and are down 10% and 29% YTD respectively. They have also exhibited lower correlation with Bitcoin over the past year moving in tandem with tech equities.Recently, several companies such as Japan-based investment firm Metaplanet and Nasdaq-listed medical device maker Semler Scientific have followed MicroStrategy, Tesla, and The Block in allocating portions of their balance sheets to Bitcoin.Interestingly, Metaplanet surged 85% since announcing its BTC investment strategy. SMLR is also up around 10%, both outperforming MSTR, SQ, and TSLA after their initial purchase disclosures.Bitcoin's appeal as a treasury asset has increased following the approval of new crypto accounting rules by the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in December 2023. Previously, crypto was classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset under U.S. accounting rules, requiring companies to write the asset down if its value fell below its purchase price, potentially leading to significant impairment losses.The new rules, which will take effect in December 2024, will allow companies to record Bitcoin and certain other crypto assets at fair market value. In response to these new requirements, Kaiko has introduced several data products in recent months to assist companies with tax reporting, audit, and accounting purposes.Robinhood looks to crypto for growthRobinhood announced Thursday that it will acquire Europe-based crypto exchange Bitstamp. The $200 million cash deal will help the US retail trading platform grow its crypto business, the firm said.Bitstamp accounted for between 10% and 15% of US exchange market share over the past month, with average daily trading volume of around $9.3bn in the second quarter, according to Kaiko’s latest exchange ranking report.Robinhood offers access to just over 30 cryptocurrencies with trading volumes of $36 billion in the first quarter, according to its latest earnings report. These volumes led to $126 million in transaction based revenue related to crypto trading. The addition of Bitstamp, which offers trading in nearly 80 different cryptoccurencies, could see the firm grow crypto-related revenues further.BNB hits record highBinance-affiliated BNB hit a record high above $717 last week. Ahead of the move higher most of the token's trading volume was focused on perpetual futures markets. Price discovery in crypto markets is often linked to volume, and this move higher was a prime example of that.Kaiko's data lets us locate price discovery by comparing perpetual futures and spot volume ratios, revealing which market has greater relative volume. BNB perps gained relative to spot in May, with the ratio reaching 5 as open interest soared after funding rates flipped positive. This suggests that price discovery was taking place in perps markets as opposed to spot.TRY share of fiat volumes hits an all-time highIn early June, the Turkish Lira (TRY) market share of crypto volume hit an all-time high of 19%, surpassing the euro as the third largest fiat currency by volume. Historically, currency devaluation and FX volatility have been a significant driver of crypto adoption, particularly in developing markets. Turkey's inflation surged in 2022 exceeding 70% while the lira has been one of the worst-performing fiat currencies.The rising share of TRY volume is also related to the increasing regulatory scrutiny and the loss of banking partners that Binance, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, has experienced. This led to the delisting of its GBP and AUD trading pairs on the exchange last year and boosted the share of the TRY in overall fiat trade volumes.FX volatility has increased over the past months due to the growing divergence in monetary policy and the record number of elections in 2024. In the past month and a half, we've seen the British pound (GBP) hit its highest level against the euro (EUR) in two years, the Japanese yen (JPY) fall to a 30-year low against the US dollar (USD), and the Mexican peso (MXN) tumble to its weakest level since October 2023.

Samson Mow Makes Crucial Bitcoin (BTC) Statement: Details

Bitcoin maximalist and chief executive of Jan3 Samson Mow has published a BTC-themed post on his X platform account which triggered a wave of heated responses from the Bitcoin community.Earlier today, Mow revisited his post published on Monday evening, adding a super bullish Bitcoin price prediction to it.Mow's bullish Bitcoin statementSamson Mow, the boss of the Bitcoin adoption-focused company Jan3, published a diagram that shows the proportion of available capital in the market versus Bitcoin that so far remains available in circulation and is to be potentially minted through mining.There are no digits on this diagram but it just makes it clear visually that the amount of available BTC is tiny compared to how much available capital can be used for buying it. Both the capital and Bitcoin are depicted in the shapes of triangles and together they look like a sandglass.Mow tweeted earlier today that while “watching the Bitcoin price dropping, just remember where it inevitably goes,” thus making a bullish BTC price prediction. Mow is one of the maximalists who expect the world’s flagship cryptocurrency to eventually reach the $1 million-per-coin price level. However, Mow also shared surprise at the current Bitcoin decline despite a staggering level of adoption that can be observed now: “Feels weird seeing #Bitcoin price go down when we're at a level of unprecedented adoption. BTFD!” BTFD, as he explained in the comments to that tweet, stands for “buy the friendly dip.”Bitcoin community reactsIn the comments to the tweet with the diagram, many Bitcoin fans pointed out that in reality the triangle of the available capital should be much bigger and the triangle of available BTC much smaller.Mow responded that it is worth taking a closer look at the bigger triangle of capital and then it will become obvious that “"Available Capital" goes outside the boundaries of the diagram.”Bitcoin drops farther downOver the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has demonstrated a sudden plunge of almost 4%, plummeting from the $70,000 price level that it managed to recapture on Monday to $67,453, where it is trading at the time of this writing.Over the weekend, BTC faced a similar price decline, dropping from above $71,660 to the $69,000 price tag.

$2 Billion Crypto Funds Flow Into Market On Rate Cut Buzz


																The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with renewed optimism as investment funds witness a historic inflow surge. CoinShares, a leading digital asset manager, reported a record-breaking $2 billion influx into crypto funds in just one week, surpassing the entire month of May’s net inflows.
This positive trend, now spanning five consecutive weeks, has propelled total assets under management (AUM) in crypto funds back above the coveted $100 billion mark, a level last seen in March 2024.

Bitcoin ETFs Fueling The Fire
Bitcoin, the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, remains the primary focus of investor interest. The recent launch and sustained inflows into US-approved spot Bitcoin ETFs are a major driver of the current market sentiment.
Source: CoinShares
These exchange-traded funds, which allow investors to hold Bitcoin without directly owning the digital asset, saw $890 million pour in on June 4th alone, marking their third-largest inflow day ever.
This enthusiasm for Bitcoin ETFs suggests a growing appetite for regulated and accessible ways to participate in the crypto market, potentially attracting a broader range of investors.
Ethereum Shines Bright, Altcoins Show Promise
While Bitcoin takes center stage, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is also enjoying a strong run. Ethereum funds raked in nearly $70 million last week, marking their best week since March 2024.
Source: CoinShares
CoinShares attributes this positive inflow to investor anticipation surrounding the upcoming launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in the US. The approval of these ETFs could further legitimize the Ethereum ecosystem and unlock significant investment potential.
Beyond the top two coins, altcoins like Fantom and XRP are also experiencing a resurgence in investor interest, with inflows of $1.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively. This broader market participation suggests a potential return of investor confidence across the crypto landscape.
CoinShares said it observed that inflows were unusually widespread across nearly all providers, coupled with a continued reduction in outflows from incumbents.
They attribute this shift in sentiment to weaker-than-expected macroeconomic data in the US, which has heightened expectations for an imminent monetary policy rate cut.

Crypto Price Stagnation, Economic Uncertainty
Despite the surge in fund inflows, cryptocurrency prices haven’t exhibited a corresponding significant upward movement. This disconnect could be attributed to several factors, including lingering investor uncertainty surrounding the future of US economic policy.

Mining crypto: Bitfarms opposes the acquisition of Riot Blockchain

After the news a few days ago about Riot Blockchain’s interest in Bitfarms, the crypto mining company is taking steps to make the acquisition more difficult.
In fact, Bitfarms has adopted a plan regarding shareholder rights that would allow a hostile takeover attempt only in very limited circumstances. 

Riot Blockchain and the expansion of crypto mining
Riot Blockchain, now known as Riot Platforms, is a publicly traded company that engages in crypto mining. 
A few days ago, the news spread that it is looking for new solutions to compensate for the reduction in revenue caused by the halving of Bitcoin. 
The halving, which occurred on April 20, halved the reward for miners, but the competition has not decreased by much. 
Taking the weekly averages from Hashrate Index, Bitcoin’s hashrate went from 650 Eh/s on April 19 to the current 604, reducing by only 7% after the halving. 
Mining is a competition in which those with more hashrate earn more, so miners are effectively encouraged to keep their hashrate as high as possible. 
Only with the halving, the prize revenues have been halved, and since it is precisely the hashrate that consumes electricity, and therefore generates the highest costs, the miners now have a problem. 
The profitability of mining has collapsed after the halving, dropping from about $0.11 per day per THash/s to the current $0.05, more than halving. This level is currently the lowest ever. 
RIOT in the stock market
Riot Platforms is listed on the stock exchange at Nasdaq with the ticker RIOT.
After the annual peaks in February, when the price of its shares had risen above $17, during the month and a half preceding the halving it collapsed below $8, losing more than half of its value. 
The investors and speculators feared that the company might have problems as a result of the halving, and in fact, they were right. 
However, subsequently the price has risen, so much so that it is now just below $10.
The current price level, however, is close to the lows of 2024, and it is in line with what RIOT stocks had in mid-December 2023 before the rise began. 
It is worth noting, however, that it is higher than that of October and November, when it was even below 9$, and especially that it is much higher than that of the end of 2022, when it dropped to almost 3$.
It is however important to highlight that the historical highs of 2021 are still very far away, given that it reached almost 80$. 
The difference between the almost $80 of February 2021 and the $17 of February 2024 says a lot about how excessive the FOMO was back then, as well as how much the financial markets have already “punished” Riot before the halving due to the inevitable effects that this event would have had on its revenues. 
The acquisition of Bitfarms 
Among the various solutions that Riot Platforms is trying to study to contain the losses, there are mergers and acquisitions. 
In particular, he has set his eyes on Bitfarms, another crypto mining company from America. 
Anche Bitfarms è quotata in borsa al Nasdaq, con i ticker BITF, ma mentre ieri RIOT è salita dell’1,8$, BITF è scesa di quasi il 4,2%. In after-market ha poi recuperato un misero 0,4%.
The BITF stock, however, is performing less poorly than that of RIOT in the medium-long term, because compared to the $1.1 at the end of 2023, the current price of $2.3 is significantly higher. 
Furthermore, in percentage terms, it is less distant from the historical highs of 2021 compared to RIOT, and from the 0.4% at the end of 2022, it has gained a lot. 
So it really seems that Riot Platforms wants to incorporate a rival company that, at least on the stock market, is performing better. 
Note that RIOT capitalizes 2.8 billion dollars, while BITF less than 900 million, so it is three times smaller. 
Crypto mining: The opposition of Bitfarms to the OPA of Riot Blockchain
Bitfarms, however, would not want to be acquired. 
It should be noted that Bitfarms is a “public” company, because as much as 75% of its shares are on the market (in borsa). 
So in theory Riot Platforms should not have major problems launching a hostile takeover bid against it, provided that it offers shareholders an interesting selling price. 
The company, however, reacted to try to oppose this hostile takeover, developing a plan regarding shareholders’ rights that would allow a hostile takeover only in very limited circumstances. 
In fact, the plan provides that in the event that a single entity manages to acquire at least 15% of the shares by September 20, and then increases the stake to 20% without the approval of the board, the other shareholders could purchase ordinary shares at a significant discount compared to the market price. 
Bitfarms is a Canadian company, and in Canada these measures are allowed by law. The result would be that Riot could still launch a hostile takeover bid, but it would see its shareholding diluted once the shares are purchased on the market. 
Riot is actually already a shareholder of Bitfarms, and in fact, the climb has already begun, given that today it should have become the single largest shareholder with more than 11% of the shares. 
Furthermore, during the recent shareholders’ meeting of Bitfarms, its very own co-founder, Emiliano Grodzki, was ousted from the board of directors. 
In other words, a real internal clash is taking place within Bitfarms between Riot, which is trying to take it over, and the other shareholders who do not want the company to be acquired in this way.

ZKSync’s 17.5% Airdrop: What You Need to Know


ZKSync has announced the distribution of 17.5% of its ZK token supply through an airdrop. This marks a pivotal step in engaging its community in the protocol’s future development. 
ZKSync, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, enhances scalability and reduces transaction costs using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs. 
Users Complain Not Being Eligible For ZK Airdrop

The ZK token facilitates network fee payments and allows community voting on protocol upgrades. Moreover, it enables token holders to engage directly with the ZKsync governance system. 
This system is crucial as it permits protocol enhancements such as staking and other functionalities, emphasizing the community’s role in steering ZKsync’s evolution.

“A 17.5% airdrop to 695,232 wallets is the largest distribution of tokens to users amongst major rollups. Airdropped tokens do not have any vesting or lock up periods, and are fully liquid on day one. This amount is larger than the locked allocations for the Matter Labs team (16.1%) and its investors (17.2%),” ZKSync’s Community Blog mentioned.

ZK Token Distribution. Source: ZKNation
The strategy behind the distribution aims to empower real, active users within the ZKsync community. Unlike typical airdrops prioritizing sheer wallet numbers, ZKsync’s approach focuses on rewarding those who have interacted with the platform. 
This includes transactions and participation in new decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols on ZKsync.
However, the airdrop has sparked some controversy. Some users claim that they are not eligible despite using only one wallet.

“How tf am I not eligible? I’m in tears seriously.. been using only one wallet, checked out and used different protocols. Ah, just so dissapointing,” ZKSync community member Ahrlien said.


To counteract the dominance of large stakeholders or “crypto whales,” ZKSync has implemented a cap, limiting allocations to a maximum of 100,000 tokens per address. This cap ensures a more equitable distribution, allowing a broader section of the community to benefit from and contribute to ZKsync’s growth.
Eligibility for the airdrop is divided into two categories – 89% of the tokens are reserved for users who have met specific activity thresholds on ZKsync. The remaining 11% is allocated to contributors who have supported the ecosystem through development, advocacy, or education.

Community members can check their eligibility now. The claim period opens next week and extends until January 3, 2025. There are also special provisions for GitHub developers and discussion helpers associated with ZKSync.

ZkSync Will Airdrop 3.7 Billion ZK Tokens to User Wallets Next Week - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsZkSync will begin distributing two-thirds of its 21 billion ZK token supply to community wallets next week in what will be the largest token distribution from an Ethereum scaling project.An initial airdrop of 17.5% of the tokens will take place next week and the rest will be distributed through ecosystem initiatives and governance measures voted on by the newly created ZK Nation. The airdropped tokens, which will be distributed to 695,232 wallets, will be fully liquid on day one and not be subject to a lock-up period.But the foundation has capped the maximum allocation to any one wallet at 100,000 ZK tokens."It's easy for whales to run away with large allocations without any constraints," the foundation wrote in a press release. "By capping whales, the ZK airdrop fairly rewards community members that contribute to zkSync in different ways."That means 89% of airdropped tokens will go to users who've been active in the ecosystem and the rest will be distributed to developers, researchers, and companies that have contributed to the zkSync L2.The one-third of tokens that's not been allocated to the community will be split: 17.2% for investors and another 16.1% for the Matter Labs team. The investor and Matter Labs tokens will be under a 1-year lockup, after which they'll gradually unlock until June 2028.Matter Labs, the company behind the popular Ethereum scaling solution, said eligibility and allocations for the airdrop was determined by a March 24 snapshot of users who've been active on the zkSync Era L2 or used the zkSync Lite wallet—"marking the one-year anniversary of zkSync Era mainnet launch," the company wrote in a press release.zkSync Era launched last March. It saw its total value locked peak at $990 million in March this year, around the time when markets were getting a huge boost from Bitcoin ETF frenzy, but has since receded to $786 million, according to L2 Beat. That makes it the 8th largest L2 by total value locked.Arbitrum One, an L2 scaling solution that uses optimistic rollup technology, is far and away the most dominant. It accounts for $18 billion worth of total value locked, which is approximately 40% of all assets currently on Ethereum L2 networks.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

MetaMask Adds Pooled Ethereum Staking Service-But Not for US or UK - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsMetaMask, a leading Ethereum wallet and browser extension, has launched its pooled staking service, allowing users to stake any amount of ETH.Ethereum staking is the mechanism by which validators on the proof of stake network participate in consensus, or the verification of transactions before they're added to the blockchain. If their nodes process blocks of transactions that are online and process blocks when assigned, they collect rewards. And if they don't, they can see their staked ETH slashed as a penalty.But users need 32 ETH to become a validator—a criteria that 99% of holders fall short of, MetaMask said in its press release.The pooled staking will allow MetaMask users to stake any amount of ETH and earn rewards for contributing to the network's security. The service is currently available to a small group of users, with a broader rollout expected soon.However, it will not initially be available in the United States or United Kingdom.The crackdown on staking services in the U.S. has been severe. In 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission fined Kraken $30 million in a settlement over charges that its crypto staking service constituted an unregistered offering of securities. Coinbase saw its staking service curtailed after the SEC made similar allegations against the San Francisco-based crypto exchange.In the U.K., things are a bit less dire—but still unclear.Economic Secretary to the Treasury Bim Afolami promised in Feburary this year that staking and stablecoin rules would be read in six months. When asked about progress during a Financial Times Crypto and Digital Asset Summit, he said he's still confident the rules will be implemented."What I’m very confident we’ll be able to achieve is the secondary legislation around staking and stablecoins," Afolami said during the London event. "Those two things are absolute priorities in the coming weeks and months."Some members of the Ethereum community have seen the regulatory pressure or lack of clarity as an opportunity to further decentralize the network. As it stands, the U.S. accounts for 50% of all validator nodes on the network, followed by Germany with 12%, South Korea with 6%, and the UK with 4%, according to Etherscan.Matthieu Saint Olive, senior product manager at Consensys—the company behind Metamask—emphasized the simplicity and control offered by the new service. “MetaMask users now have an easy way to stake ETH in enterprise-grade validators while maintaining full control of their ETH, earning rewards, and making Ethereum more secure,” he said.MetaMask's pooled staking is backed by Consensys Staking, which manages over 33,000 Ethereum validators and more than 1 million ETH staked. The company boasted in its press release that its has zero slashed validators and a 99.9% validator participation rate.MetaMask's move into pooled staking pits it against established players like Lido and Coinbase, which does still offer its staking service internationally and in several U.S. states. Together the two  providers account for almost 45% of the 33 million ETH—worth $116 billion at the time of writing—that's been staked on the network.Lido, the largest liquid staking platform, allows users to stake ETH and receive Lido Staked Ethereum (stETH) tokens, which can be used in DeFi applications while earning an annual percentage yield (APY) around 3.8%. The project's extensive liquidity and integration with numerous dApps make it a formidable competitor.Meanwhile Coinbase, though it has had to cut back on its staking service availability, is still the second-largest pooled staking provider by a wide margin. Its 15% portion is three times the size of the next couple competitors Figment, Ether.fi, and Kiln.fi.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

BNB backslides after hitting ATH: What to expect this week - AMBCrypto



BNB corrects 10% below its all-time high with a slightly bearish RSI of 49.91.
Rising MACD and high social dominance hint at possible bullish rebound.

After hitting an all-time high last week, it seems that Binance Coin [BNB] bulls are taking a step back, plunging the token right into a somewhat expected correction. 
At press time, prices were over 12% below the all-time high. In what way could BNB end the week?
Taking a look at BNB’s 5-day chart, we see the RSI is currently just below the neutral 50 level at around 49.91, suggesting a balanced but slightly bearish momentum. 
However, the MACD line is above the signal line and above zero, suggesting some bullish momentum is starting to build.
Source: TradingView
Will BNB recover soon?
Current trading was close to $644, well below the recent high, indicating the correction is in full swing. However, the exponential moving average also shows the price below it, reinforcing the bearish trend.
Notably, there was a significant spike in BNB’s social volume that coincides with the price drop.
 During periods of high social volume, BNB’s dominance also shows spikes, indicating that it is still a very popular topic of discussion in crypto communities and will remain so for the foreseeable future.
Source: Santiment
The trading volume for BNB derivatives has surged by 157.99%, as it has steadily been doing for the past ten days. 
The Long/Short ratio across different platforms shows a dominance of long positions, particularly with ratios over 1.5 on OKX and top traders on Binance.
Source: Coinglass
This bias towards long positions can reflect a generally bullish sentiment among active traders. 
Considering the current technical setup and market sentiment, BNB may continue to experience some level of volatility throughout the week as it seeks to find a new equilibrium post-correction. 

Realistic or not, here’s BNB’s market cap in BTC terms

If the momentum holds and the broader market stays relatively bullish, the bulls will likely successfully push past the all-time high of $717 by the end of Friday. 
All in all, BNB is set to have quite a volatile week.

PENDLE price outlook as whale deposits tokens on Binance - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Pendle (PENDLE) price dips 3% to near key support area.
A whale has deposited 755k PENDLE tokens on Binance.
Arthur Hayes has also staked 1.65 million PENDLE, worth about $8.4 million.

Pendle (PENDLE), the native token of the tokenization and future yield trading protocol Pendle Finance, has dropped 3% in the past 24 hours. 
PENDLE’s price dip comes as a major whale deposits a huge chunk of the token on Binance likely for profit.
However, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes has staked 1.65 million PENDLE until September.  
PENDLE price declines amid whale activity
According to CoinGecko data, PENDLE price hovered around 5.13 across top crypto exchanges, down 16% this past week.
The declines follow a broader market dip for cryptocurrencies after the Bitcoin price slipped below $68,000 on Tuesday. 
Meanwhile, PENDLE price has struggled with sell-off pressure after last week’s major unstaking of the token by crypto whale and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes.
On June 6, Lookonchain reported that Hayes had unstaked 1.55 million PENDLE worth over $9.41 million. The unstaking saw PENDLE price dip from around $6.30 to lows of $5.34.
On June 11, Lookonchain also shared on-chain data showing another major whale deposited millions worth of PENDLE to the Binance exchange. Specifically, the whale deposited 755,000 PENDLE tokens worth $3.83 million to the exchange.
This whale initially withdrew 5.02 million PENDLE from Binance on August 18, 2023. At the time, the tokens were worth $2.73 million, with each token priced at $0.54.
Hayes stakes 1.65 million PENDLE
While Arthur Hayes unstaked a huge chunk of tokens last week, he’s just locked 1.65 million PENDLE worth $8.4 million. The new locked tokens are until September 5, 2024. Is this bullish for the token? 
Hayes has previously expressed an optimistic outlook for the rapidly expanding liquid staking derivatives finance (LSDfi) token. 
The Pendle ecosystem’s total value locked (TVL) stands at over $6.52 billion, up 53% in the past 30 days. 
While PENDLE  is now trading at price levels last seen in early May, bulls can retake control if they hold above $5.00. On the flipside, a dip below $5.00 could strengthen bears.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burns 7,912,388 Tokens as Burn Rate Shoots up 2,814%

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is on a very tight leash as the price continues to nosedive in consonance with the broader digital currency ecosystem. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is down by 2.37% in 23 hours to $0.00002234, but this slump is buoyed by the 2,814% surge in the token’s burn rate.Data from Shibburn pegs the actual Shiba Inu burnt at 7,912,388 SHIB, a figure that is a massive liftof from around 200,000 tokens incinerated earlier on Monday. At least three wallets featured prominently in the burn rate jump as they contributed more than 1 million SHIB each to the dead wallet.Shiba Inu Burn Rate via ShibburnThe biggest of the three wallets ‘0x608...9fe80’ helped incinerate a total of 4,320,587 SHIB. Also wallets ‘0xc66...650ae’ and ‘0x608...9fe80’ added 1,538,128 SHIB and 1,031,814 SHIB respectively. More smaller SHIB contributions were also made to the burn address bringing the total number of Shiba Inu tokens burnt from initial circulation to 410,726,546,023,229 SHIB.Shiba Inu is currently at the mercy of the broader digital currency ecosystem. With the price of Bitcoin dropping below the $68,000 mark, both Shiba Inu and other tokens with a higher correlation to BTC have a relatively lower chance of printing a solo recovery.Besides the burn rate metric, Shiba Inu is now gradually faring better in its other core performance markers. At this time, the daily trading volume underscores the ongoing mild revival in its community with a surge of 33.35% in 24 hours to $624,883,442. Besides this the whale transaction has blown up, surging by 438% in what has seen a total of $172.5 million traded overnight. While Shiba Inu fundamentals remain bullish, the recovery in the short term might come down to its on-chain figures across the board.

Here’s when Bitcoin will hit $100k, according to ChatGPT-4o


    Although Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped back below the important psychological price level of $70,000, its supporters have retained strong optimism regarding its future price, and a popular artificial intelligence (AI) model has provided insights on when the maiden cryptocurrency could hit $100,000.



Indeed, Bitcoin has recorded declines in the past few days but has advanced over 60% since the year’s turn and has reached a new all-time high (ATH) in March, weeks before its latest halving event, and two months after the approval of multiple spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.



ChatGPT Bitcoin price prediction $100,000



In this context, the newest and most advanced OpenAI project ChatGPT, called ChatGPT-4o, has analyzed available online information and offered a forecast that the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset could “achieve the $100,000 price mark by late 2024 to 2025.” Specifically:








“Given the combination of historical precedents, bullish technical indicators, supportive expert opinions, significant market developments, and positive sentiment, it is plausible to forecast that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 within the next 12 to 18 months, particularly as post-halving dynamics unfold and institutional inflows increase.”




Additionally, according to ChatGPT-4o, positive regulatory development and “various projections align with this viewpoint,” as well as taking into account the fact that Bitcoin had “skyrocketed 661% from its halving event in May 2020 to reach an all-time high of nearly $69,000 by November 2021.”



Bitcoin price analysis



For now, the largest asset in the crypto sector by market capitalization is changing hands at the price of $67,540, which represents a decline of 2.74% in the last 24 hours, as well as a 1.83% loss across the previous seven days, while gaining 10.71% over the past month, according to the recent charts.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales seem to be anticipating a pump in the asset’s price, having opened massive long positions at the $69,000 mark, according to Ki Young Ju, founder of crypto analysis platform CryptoQuant, signaling potential bullish sentiment, as Finbold reported on June 9.







More recently, renowned crypto trading expert Michaël van de Poppe projected that Bitcoin might test the area between $64,000 and $65,000 “before the markets are reversing back upwards due to the upcoming [Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)] meeting & [Consumer Price Index (CPI)] data,” as per his X post on June 11.

All things considered, ChatGPT-4o’s predictions of Bitcoin hitting the price of $100,000 in the suggested period might come true. That said, one should take AI platforms’ insights with a grain of salt, complementing them with additional research, risk analysis, and keeping up with any relevant developments.

SHIB Price Tanks but This Metric Soars by 2800%


																TL;DR

Shiba Inu’s burn rate surged by 2,800% in the past 24 hours.
Despite increased burn efforts and advancements in the layer-2 scaling solution, Shibarium, SHIB’s price remains down, reflecting the overall market correction.


SHIB’s Burning Efforts
Shiba Inu’s burn rate exploded by 2,800% in the past 24 hours, resulting in almost 8 million tokens removed from circulation. Data shows that over 50% of the amount was destroyed in a single transaction approximately 17 hours ago. 
The burning program aims to reduce the tremendous supply of the meme coin and create potential value appreciation through scarcity. SHIB has a maximum supply of 999,982,363,413,352 tokens, with more than 41% already sent to a null address.
The mechanism is rather complicated and involves both automatic and manual burns. If you want to learn more about it, feel free to read our dedicated guide here. Not long ago, the team behind the meme coin introduced “a transformative token mechanism” to automate the entire system.
However, it’s worth noting that SHIB remains deep in the red, plummeting by 3% on a daily scale and 6% weekly (per CoinGecko’s data). Its pullback coincides with an overall market correction, where Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled to as low as $67,500, while Ethereum (ETH) neared the $3,500 mark. 




The fluctuation in the burn rate might have been caused by someone moving to liquidate their position during times of market uncertainty and increased volatility.

Federal Reserve Should Cut U.S. Interest Rate as Restrictive Stance Is Adding to Inflation, Democrats Say

"We write today to urge the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to cut the federal funds rate from its current, two-decade-high of 5.5 percent. This sustained period of high interest rates is already slowing the economy and is failing to address the remaining key drivers of inflation," Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) wrote, according to a document on the HuffPost website.

Solana’s Surgical Strike to Stop Sandwich Attacks


                                Solana Excludes Validators Involved in Sandwich Attacks                                The Solana Foundation has removed validators participating in sandwich attacks, which exploit pending transactions to manipulate asset prices. This move is part of Solana’s crackdown on scammers and hackers. These attackers place buy and sell orders around pending transactions, leaving retail investors with unfavorable prices. Tim Garcia announced on Discord that such malicious activities will not be tolerated, with violators facing permanent expulsion from the program.News Explanation:The Solana Foundation has implemented strict measures against scammers and hackers associated with the Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency. The Foundation has removed a group of validator operators from its delegation program for their involvement in sandwich attacks. In these attacks, malicious traders hunt for pending transactions on networks like Ethereum. They carry out the attack by placing a buy order before and a sell order immediately after the pending transaction, manipulating asset prices to make a profit. Retail investors are typically left with the worst prices, while the attackers make all the profits. Validators who enabled these sandwich attacks were identified through their activities in the mempool. This decision aligns with the Solana Foundation’s rules designed to prevent malicious activities. Validators found guilty will no longer be assigned any delegation tasks.Tim Garcia, the Lead of Solana Validator Relations, announced the removal of these validators on Discord. He stated that participation in malicious activities, such as attacking transactions or harming Solana users by engaging in private mempools, will not be tolerated. Anyone discovered to be involved in such activities will be immediately expelled from the program and permanently banned from any association with the Solana Foundation.Purpose of the Solana Foundation Delegator Program:The Solana Foundation Delegator Program was created to relieve users of the burden of holding large amounts of SOL tokens by allowing them to delegate staking rights to validators. Delegation enables users to delegate staking rights to a stake pool or validator, who is then responsible for creating blocks and verifying transactions. Validators are selected based on their performance. This action by the Solana Foundation highlights their commitment to user security. Solana is one of the cryptocurrencies with a large user base, following Bitcoin and Ethereum. Experts believe SOL has significant growth potential, comparable to Bitcoin.Also Read:- Global Popular Memecoin FLOKI Plans to Build a School in India

            Shares of Metaplanet, a publicly traded company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and often compared to MicroStrategy, have surged 9.88% after the company announced its third Bitcoin acquisition, according to data from Google Finance.Metaplanet’s shares jump after its third Bitcoin purchaseMetaplanet said Monday it had added 23.351 Bitcoin (BTC), worth around 250 million yen ($1.58 million), to its holdings.

In a recent development that has caught the attention of the cryptocurrency community, PeckShieldAlert reported that addresses associated with FTX and Alameda transferred approximately $12 million worth of cryptocurrency. This significant movement included 5 vBTC, worth around $7 million, sent to Wintermute and 10 million WXRP worth $5.2 million transferred to Binance.Wrapped XRP (WXRP) is a tokenized version of XRP that exists on other blockchains, allowing XRP holders to use their assets in decentralized applications. Meanwhile, FTX and Alameda, both involved in bankruptcy proceedings, have been under scrutiny for their cryptocurrency holdings and transactions. FTX's exact remaining XRP holdings remain unknown. Reports from September indicated that the bankrupt exchange had over 225 million XRP in its accounts. If the most recent transfer data is accurate, the amount sent to Binance represents no more than 4.44% of the total XRP held by FTX and Alameda.XRP price outlookThis transaction coincides with a notable drop in the market value of XRP. Since the beginning of the day, the price of XRP has fallen more than 3.4%, dropping below the key psychological level of $0.50 per XRP. This decline raises questions about possible correlations between the FTX transfer and recent price movements.XRP to USD by CoinMarketCapWhile it is possible that the price decline and the large transfer are unrelated, such a significant movement of assets could affect market sentiment. The transfer could scare off investors and reinforce bearish predictions, putting further downward pressure on XRP's price.

Is Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF Next? Famous Name Announces His Altcoin Portfolio! - Bitcoin Sistemi

New statements came from BitMEX former CEO Arthur Hayes, who attracted the attention of investors with his trades and predictions.
Speaking about Dogecoin (DOGE) this time, Hayes claimed that Dogecoin is so popular that funders cannot ignore it as institutions want to enter the cryptocurrency industry.


Interviewed by Jessica Walker alongside Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, Hayes believes that once regulators approve both the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs, they will inevitably approve the Dogecoin ETF as well.
Stating that Dogecoin and cryptocurrencies have a critical role in the US elections, the famous name said that memecoins such as DOGE have a long way to go.





Stating that the FED and the US Treasury will print more and more money, Hayes stated that this will make the cryptocurrency market even crazier and more popular.
Raoul Pal and Hayes said investors expect Dogecoin to receive U.S. ETF approval by the end of the current bull market cycle.


Hayes had this to say about DOGE ETFs:

“Dogecoin is the oldest memecoin on Robinhood.
“If you're looking at Tradfi getting into crypto and they're going to put ETFs on everything they can, it's a high market cap thing.”

Both Hayes and Pal said memecoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), BONK, and Dogwifhat (WIF) make up part of their portfolios.





Arthur Hayes recently predicted that Aptos (APT), the 27th ranked cryptocurrency by market cap, will surpass Solana (SOL) in the next 1 to 3 years.

US Bitcoin Spot ETFs Milestone: 25,729 BTC Acquired In A Week | Bitcoinist.com


								Amid a broader wave of increased adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency asset, United States BTC Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the past week acquired a substantial amount of BTC approximately 25,729.
This development is consistent with current patterns in which significant financial institutions and businesses have begun to accept the asset, thereby strengthening its standing within the international financial system.​
Bitcoin Spot ETFs Accumulation Matching Nearly Two Months’ Mining Production
Popular trading platform and analyst TOBTC reported the development on the X (formerly Twitter) platform on Monday. According to the platform, considering the current mining rate of roughly 3.125 BTC for each block, this enormous stockpile is equivalent to roughly two months’ worth of newly mined Bitcoin, with inflows reaching over $1.83 billion.

The increase in ETF holdings is indicative of investors’ rising faith in Bitcoin’s long-term worth and ability to act as a hedge against volatile economic conditions. It also illustrates how BTC is becoming more widely accepted and integrated into traditional financial products, bridging the divide between conventional finance and the developing digital asset market.​
Highest BTC acquisition since March | Source: TOBTC on X
Furthermore, TOBTC noted that the acquisition represents the largest weekly purchase since March, when Bitcoin hit its current all-time high, and is nearly equal to the total amount of the crypto asset purchased in May. Following the launch of the products in January, 11 approved ETFs have had net inflows of a whopping $15.69 billion, despite large withdrawals from Grayscale Investment’s fund.
Blackrock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) currently has the largest BTC holdings for a spot BTC ETF. Thus far, the biggest asset management company in the world, Blackrock has collected an astounding 304,976 BTC, valued at approximately $21 billion for their exchange fund. This enormous investment demonstrates BlackRock‘s belief in the long-term prospects of the digital asset and the expanding institutional interest in cryptocurrencies.
Given the company’s substantial holdings, they may help BTC gain more traction and recognition in the general public as the cryptocurrency industry develops. In addition, with the support of such a prestigious financial firm, the crypto asset appears to have a bright future.
A Major Focus In Digital Asset Investment
It is important to note that BTC has become a significant player in the entire digital asset investment products market. Inflows into digital asset investment products reached $2 billion, raising the total for the last five weeks of inflows to $4.3 billion.

Also, ETP trading volumes increased to about $12.8 billion for the week, which is a 55% upsurge over the previous week. Meanwhile, with $1.97 billion in inflows for the week, Bitcoin was once again the main focus.
TOBTC also underscored that Ethereum witnessed a $69 million net inflows during the period, marking its strongest week since March. This is most likely due to the unexpected decision to permit spot Ethereum ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Ripple finalizes acquisition of Standard Custody - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Ripple has completed the acquisition of Standard Custody & Trust Company, according to a news release published on Tuesday.
The news comes months after Ripple revealed its intention to acquire the regulated digital assets custody solution.

Ripple closes Standard Custody acquisition
Standard Custody allows Ripple to add a regulated limited purpose trust company to its portfolio, given the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has licensed the custody firm.
According to the blockchain company’s announcement today, the deal received all the necessary regulatory approvals.
With this deal, Ripple has now completed two huge acquisitions in the digital assets custody market.
In May 2023, Ripple acquired Metaco, a leading digital asset custody provider for institutional investors. This new deal underscores Ripple’s growth and presence within the digital assets ecosystem, per the announcement.
Ripple’s eyes on stablecoin market
Ripple traction is now across cross-border payments, crypto custody, CBDCs and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) – including stocks, bonds and commodities. Ripple is also eyeing entry into the stablecoin market.
“This is an exciting new chapter for Ripple to strengthen its existing product offerings and explore new, complementary products like stablecoins—underpinned by a commitment to regulatory compliance,” Ripple wrote in a blog post.
Ripple recently announced plans to debut a US dollar-backed stablecoin, a development that will see the company tap into the stablecoin and the native crypto token XRP to bolster its payments solution. 
The US-based crypto company plans to issue the new stablecoin on the XRP Ledger and will leverage it to expand liquidity to XRPL’s native decentralized exchange (DEX).
“There is huge demand for stablecoins that deliver trust, stability and utility, and Ripple will leverage its decade-plus of experience building real-world financial solutions for global institutions to address this growing market,” the company noted.
Jack McDonald, CEO of Standard Crypto, joins Ripple as Senior Vice President of Stablecoins.

Apple's WWDC Disappoints, Drags Down AI Crypto Prices


							

AI announcements at WWDC2024 failed to impress investors.



Tokens linked to Render, Fetch.ai etc. dropped 3-5% despite flat crypto market.



AI crypto index underperformed, Apple stock price fell. 




Investors in AI-linked cryptocurrencies saw losses after Apple’s annual developer conference failed to deliver the anticipated AI buzz. Tokens connected to projects like Render, Fetch.ai, and SingularityNET dropped between 3% and 5% in the last day, even as the broader crypto market remained flat.



This slump occurred despite anticipation that Apple (AAPL) would unveil groundbreaking AI advancements at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC2024). While the tech giant did announce “Apple Intelligence,” a suite of AI features for its devices, and a partnership to integrate OpenAI’s ChatGPT, these announcements underwhelmed investors. Analysts speculate investors were looking for details on how Apple planned to leverage AI for transformative features or entirely new product categories.









The disappointment extended beyond individual tokens. The CoinDesk Computing Index, which tracks AI-related cryptocurrencies, was one of the worst-performing sectors in the digital asset market, dropping 2.5% on the day. This underperformed both Bitcoin and the broader CoinDesk 20 Index.



With Apple’s stock price also falling despite a positive stock market, the day signaled disappointment for both AI crypto investors and Apple shareholders. This raises questions about the near-term future of AI-powered cryptocurrencies, which may depend on whether Apple or other tech giants can deliver the kind of groundbreaking AI advancements that investors crave.



A recent Bloomberg report revealed that negotiations are underway between Apple and Google for the potential incorporation of Google’s advanced AI technology, Gemini, into iPhones. This move aims to equip iPhones with a wider range of functionalities powered by AI.

These Economic Factors Could Put Bitcoin in a ‘Slow Bleed Environment’ (Bitfinex)


																With risk assets in the financial sector currently looking vulnerable, market experts have identified economic factors that could put bitcoin (BTC) in a similar light and push it into a “slow bleed environment.”
According to a Bitfinex Alpha report, risk assets are beginning to look vulnerable due to concerns that United States authorities may not cut interest rates soon. These assets, including BTC, were dented last week after regulators released stronger-than-expected jobs data. However, BTC was resilient and gracefully navigated the impact of the data due to the continued inflows into the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) market.
Forthcoming U.S. Meeting and Report
Since May 13, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have been on a 19-day inflow streak, which was broken just yesterday (June 10). The continued inflows played a significant role in underpinning bitcoin’s price on Friday after the digital currency dropped by more than three grand within an hour.
Analysts said that while the ETF inflows are bolstering bitcoin’s price, the trend could be disrupted in the coming week due to inflation signals that may emerge after the U.S. Consumer Price Index report. In addition, the forthcoming U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting on interest rates could also impact the ETF flows.
“The outcomes of these near-term economic signals could impact continued inflows and put BTC into a ranging or slow bleed environment,” Bitfinex said.
Besides the forthcoming meeting and report, funding rates are currently high in bitcoin perpetual futures markets, indicating that traders are paying a premium to open long positions. The rising bitcoin CME futures open interest (OI) and the ETF inflows suggest that traders are leveraging the arbitrage opportunity between futures and spot markets.




Bitcoin OI across major crypto exchanges hit an all-time high of $36.8 billion on June 6, and despite the price correction on Friday, OI is currently above $36 billion. Bitfinex likened the Friday plunge to a leverage flush, which wiped out many leveraged long positions on altcoins and neutralized funding rates.
Bitcoin Unable to Push Past Range High
Despite positive ETF flows offsetting the pressure on BTC, the asset has been unable to push past its range high. Before the plunge on Friday, BTC rallied to a range high at over $71,500 for the first time since the sub-$57,000 range low deviation was reached in May.
While Bitfinex does not expect a major decline immediately, bitcoin’s failure to move past range highs remains a cause for concern.

Bitcoin dips below $68k as Bitbot develops its staking feature



                    

                    Key takeaways

Bitcoin has dropped below $68k following a poor start to the week.
Bitbot is working on its staking feature after raising more than $4m in presale.

Bitcoin fails to break past the $72k resistance level and could dip lower
Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, has been underperforming over the last few days. It has lost nearly 3% of its value in the last 24 hours and is currently trading above $67k per coin. 
The poor performance comes as spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a $64 million outflow on Monday. This was the first time the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded outflows in the last three weeks. 
What is Bitbot?
The crypto market is still consolidating but that hasn’t stopped projects from building excellent products. One project that has completed its presale and is currently developing its products is Bitbot. 
Bitbot is an exciting project that has raised capital from investors in a bid to address certain pain points in the market. This Web3 project seeks to bring unique value propositions to traders in the cryptocurrency space. 
As a Telegram trading bot, Bitbot will be self-custodial, enabling users to trade via their cold wallets on Telegram. Bitbot users will enjoy certain features available only to institutional investors, making it easier for traders to grow their trading portfolios.
Bitbot to roll out staking features to users
Bitbot is rolling out tech solutions that could help retail traders excel in the cryptocurrency market. After its presale round, Bitbot is using the funds to develop products that investors can use to boost their trading activities.
According to their recent X post, the Bitbot team revealed that they are currently working on the Staking Feature for the bot. By integrating a staking feature into the Bitbot product, users who claim their tokens through the bot can stake them and earn a competitive Anual Percentage Yield.
In addition to the staking feature, Bitbot will also leverage the Knightsafe to offer a self-custody solution. This solution helps in mitigating the typical risks associated with Telegram trading.
The integration of anti-MEV and anti-rug solutions will further help users protect their assets. Finally, some of the funds raised in the presale are already being chanelled towards integrating Ultra-flexible wallet management fuelled by non-custodial API technology. 
Bitbot raised over $4m in presale
The Bitbot presale has ended and the team raised $4,323,777 during the event. With the Bitbot presale now over, the team is focusing on other aspects of its project. 
According to its website, Bitbot is currently working on the formation of its team, smart contract development, community formation, marketing drive, and alpha testing. Once those are completed, Bitbot will focus its attention on getting the $BITBOT token listed on crypto exchanges, top influencer partnerships, and its Telegram Bot launch.
The whitepaper indicated that the Bitbot development team will hold 20% of the total token supply and use it to fund ongoing development. An additional 14% is allocated to marketing & CEX listings while 3% is allocated to exchange liquidity provision.
Should you buy the Bitbot token when it launches on exchanges?
Since the presale is now officially over, the only way to obtain the $BITBOT token is to purchase it once it gets listed on centralised and decentralised exchanges. It is tough to determine the listing price as token prices are usually volatile once they launch on crypto exchanges.
However, Bitbot could be an excellent crypto project if the development team rolls out its products and they get massive adoption. Bitbot is looking to gain massive adoption in the market by offering unique technologies that would allow traders to improve their trading activities. Its $BITBOT token could be a big winner in the coming months and years with the right level of adoption.

El Salvador’s Bitcoin City has problems, but its first ‘citizen’ still wants to stay


A proponent of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has shared a deepfake video intended to criticize El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin (BTC). The clip claims to show US expat Corbin Keegan describing his decision to move from Chicago to the Gulf of Fonseca in El Salvador.
According to writer and researcher David Shares’ post on X (formerly Twitter), Keegan hoped to become the first citizen of Bitcoin City, a planned municipality that will draw geothermal power from the Conchagua volcano.
The video, which is styled like a local interest segment that might air on a local TV station, purports to show Keegan waiting despondently near the planned construction sites and sitting idly around various parts of a nondescript beach town. Text overlays cast a narrative of events that never occurred. 
Corbin Keegan reponds to deepfake about El Salvador’s Bitcoin City
The video’s promoter claimed that “Keegan decided he had enough, and has now left El Salvador to come back to the US, giving up on the idea of the Bitcoin City for the time being.” The video earned thousands of views and attracted dozens of comments from viewers who believed the tall tale.
In reality, Keegan did move to El Salvador and plans to continue waiting. He believes in Bitcoin City, despite its lengthy delays, and is optimistic about becoming one of its first residents. He admitted to visiting Chicago recently, but only to attend to brief matters before returning to El Salvador as a continuing, long-term resident.
Keegan commented directly on the video, saying, “Fake news. I’m still here.” He continued, “I’m 100 percent committed all-in Bitcoin City and El Salvador like I am Bitcoin. Nice try fake news FUD.”

Shares placed a clue in the first line of the post. Although disingenuous, he at least clued readers to an obvious mendacity — that Keegan was “the first citizen of the Bitcoin City.” Countries, not cities, have citizens.
In the end, despite El Salvador’s various problems and delays in building its bitcoin and USDT-funded metropolis, this week’s deepfake is an embarrassing attempt at anti-Bitcoin City propaganda. Corbin Keegan didn’t give up on El Salvador and decide to move back to Chicago. In fact, he’s been in El Salvador for three years and is still committed to residing in the country.

Turkish National Athletes Join Bitget's Inspirational #MakeItCount Movement - Coin Edition


							

Bitget has partnered with three Turkish athletes for its #MakeItCount campaign.



The partnership aims to inspire users and empower the Turkish crypto market.



Bitget reports significant growth in Turkey, with a 70% signup increase.




Bitget, a global leader in cryptocurrency exchange services, has partnered with three of Turkey’s most accomplished national athletes, Buse Tosun Çavuşoğlu, Samet Gümüş, and İlkin Aydın, as part of its #MakeItCount campaign.



The exchange disclosed this strategic partnership via an official press statement today, as seen by Coin Edition. Notably, the #MakeItCount campaign began with football superstar Lionel Messi in 2022. According to the report, the latest move in the initiative aims to inspire and empower users in Turkey by aligning with the country’s top sports figures.



Notably, the three athletes embody the symbols of perseverance, positive passion, and the belief that “no progress is too small.” These values resonate with Bitget’s mission through the #MakeItCount campaign, which seeks to motivate audiences to reach new heights and make a significant impact.







Reacting to the collaboration, Vugar Usi Zade, Bitget’s Chief Operating Officer, emphasized that the new partners’ beliefs align with the exchange’s core values. In Zade’s words




As the leading crypto platform, we are committed to the long-term vision of financial freedom. We see wins and losses as milestones and believe that no progress is too small. Our partners embody this belief.




Buse Tosun Çavuşoğlu, a wrestling champion, has earned numerous victories, including European and World Championship titles, exemplifying perseverance and sportsmanship. 



Samet Gümüş, a two-time European Championship gold medalist in flyweight professional boxing, is just 22 years old and inspires the younger generation with his positive passion for the sport. 



İlkin Aydın, a dynamic member of the Turkish Women’s Volleyball team, showcases her skill and intense passion for volleyball, living the mantra that “No progress is too small.”









These partnerships come at a time when Turkey’s cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant growth. Bitget has reported impressive growth metrics from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024, increasing signups by over 70%. Also, total trading volume surged by more than 270%, and net deposit amounts climbed by 240%.

Stock Market Unimpressed by Apple Intelligence, Musk Hates It - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) unveiled a suite of artificial intelligence features dubbed “Apple Intelligence” at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10, 2024. The new capabilities, set to roll out this fall in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, will be available exclusively on newer devices. However, the stock market did not seem very impressed with Apple’s AI foray, with the stock dipping after the event and into premarket trading today. One of the notable critics of the new features is Elon Musk, who took to X to complain about and mock them in a series of posts.



Apple Announces AI Features at WWDC 2024



The tech giant’s AI enhancements include a more conversational Siri that can access OpenAI’s ChatGPT when needed, custom AI-generated “Genmoji,” improved image search in the Photos app, and an “Image Playground” for generating images from prompts.



The AI system will also be capable of carrying out actions between apps, managing notifications, auto-writing content, and summarizing text. Apple emphasized its commitment to privacy, stating that many AI features will work on-device, while more complex requests will be handled in its “Private Cloud Compute” using Apple Silicon servers. The company also pledged to allow independent experts to inspect server code to verify privacy.





Market Reaction and Musk’s Criticism of Apple Intelligence



Despite the announcement, Apple’s stock price fell 1.91% to $193.12 at the previous close, with pre-market trading at 5:57 AM EDT showing a further 0.68% decline to $191.80.



The company’s market cap stands at $2.961 trillion, with a 52-week price range of $160.11 – $217.06. Analysts have set an average price target of $205.04, with a range of $164 – $275. Apple’s financials show a 26.31% profit margin, $381.62B revenue (ttm), and $6.43 EPS (ttm).



Tesla CEO Elon Musk strongly criticized Apple’s AI integration, threatening to ban Apple devices at his companies if they incorporate OpenAI’s ChatGPT at the operating system level. Musk called the integration an “unacceptable security violation” and accused Apple of selling users “down the river” by handing data to OpenAI without knowing how it will be used.



He also questioned Apple’s ability to ensure user security and privacy while claiming the company is not “smart enough to make their own AI.”







Do you think Apple’s AI approach will be successful over other firms? Let us know in the comments below.

Crypto news: a gold-backed stablecoin is coming on Ripple

Among today’s crypto news, the announcement of Meld Gold, a digital finance company, cannot be missed. They have formed a new partnership with Ripple to launch the gold-backed stablecoin on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). 

Crypto news: the stablecoin pegged to gold on Ripple’s XRPL will be launched in Q3 2024
Meld Gold, digital finance company, has announced that it has chosen Ripple’s XRP Ledger to develop and launch the new gold-backed stablecoin. 

“The time has come, @meldgold is coming to XRP Ledger (#XRPL)! Learn more about this pioneering step to launch physical #RWA on #XRPL. #XRPLedger #BuiltOnXRPL. Why XRPL? As a decentralized level 1 blockchain known for reliability and stability in the tokenization and exchange of crypto-native and real-world assets, XRP Ledger offers institutional-level functionalities and built-in features to enable secure, efficient, and scalable financial services and use cases.”
In practice, we are in the category of Real World Asset (RWA), which is the market that uses blockchain to tokenize tangible assets that exist outside the digital scenario. 
The company Meld Gold would therefore have chosen Ripple’s XRP Ledger to tokenize gold and silver. This decision was made thanks to the “reliability and stability” that Ripple offers in the tokenization and exchange of crypto and real assets.
Not only that, the announcement states that the new gold-backed stablecoin will be launched in the third quarter of this year.
Crypto news: the new Oro and Argento tokens developed on Ripple’s XRP Ledger
Moving forward with his announcement tweet, Meld Gold then included the debut of a stablecoin also developed on Ripple’s XRP Ledger, but anchored to silver. 

“What will Meld Gold launch? The Gold and Silver tokens will be available on #XRPL in the third quarter, combining the world’s oldest currency with the reliability, utility, and accessibility offered by XRPL. The Meld Gold team will continue to lead physical RWA innovation in a multi-chain future!”
Here, therefore, both the Oro token and the Argento token on Ripple’s XRPL will be launched in Q3 2024. 
In this regard, then, the tweet includes the comment from the CEO of Meld Gold, Michael Cotton, who also mentions the Algorand blockchain: 
“Integration of XRPL as the second blockchain alongside @algorand @algorandfoundation is another step towards providing unparalleled access to assets like #Gold and #Silver with industry-leading technologies.” 
The positive forecasts for XRP ETFs
Recently, Ripple has been making headlines in the ETF sector as well. Specifically, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, made some positive predictions regarding the launch of spot XRP ETFs. 
According to Garlinghouse, the approval of new ETFs on XRP in the USA will become inevitable, even if it will be necessary to wait at least until 2025. 
Along with the ETFs on XRP, many are also commenting on the spot ETFs on Solana. In fact, some rumors claim that the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, could already request an ETF on Solana next month. 
In any case, at the time of writing, XRP is worth $0.48, falling below $0.50 just last week. The current price is still very far from the annual high of $0.71 reached in March 2024.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Falls Below $67K as ETF Inflow Streak Ends

GameStop shares fell 12% on Monday, weighing heavily on some meme tokens that tend to mirror the stock's movements. Solana-based meme token GME, which parodies the company's stock ticker, slid 25%, reversing a more-than 200% rally over the past seven days. Related tokens like Roaring Kitty and some cat-themed tokens, which previously moved alongside GME stock, lost an average of at least 10%, according to data tracked by CoinGecko. Dog-themed tokens doge, shiba inu and floki pared last week's gains, falling from 4% to 10%. GameStop shares have sunk 62% from a two-year high on Thursday after the company said it would sell up to 75 million shares and announced a drop in quarterly sales.

Here's Bitcoin's predictions as BTC drops to $67K ahead of FOMC - AMBCrypto



BTC had hit long liquidity at $67K and could reverse recent losses post-FOMC. 
Trading firms underscored traders’ short-term bullish prospects despite the recent dip. 

Bitcoin [BTC] extended losses to the $67K region amidst investors’ worries about the Fed decision. 
The short-term bearish sentiment was reflected in the BTC ETFs, too, as the products broke a month-long streak of inflows. 
On the 10th of June, spot BTC ETFs recorded a daily net outflow of $64.9 million per SoSo Value data.
Source: SoSo Value
The bearish sentiment followed a stronger US Jobs report on the 7th of June, and extra volatility was expected at the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting scheduled for the 12th of June. 
Already, BTC’s dip has hit a weekly low and retested a previous short-term demand of $66.8K—$67.92K. Interestingly, Hyblock Capital data marked the level as a key long liquidity area. 
Will the short-term support above $67K hold post-FOMC, or will sellers overwhelm it? 
Bitcoin predictions: Will $67K hold?
Source: BTC/USDT, TradingView
The HTF (higher timeframe) chart showed a record weakening in buying pressure, as demonstrated by the southbound RSI (Relative Strength Index). 
However, the capital inflows into the king coin were still slightly above average as of press time, as shown by the CMF (Chaikin Money Flow). 
Notably, the $67K have prevented further BTC plunge from mid-May, but a hawkish Fed decision could swiftly tip sellers to break below the support. 
However, U.S. Senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, recently urged the Fed to consider lowering the interest rates. Should the Fed heed their call, the $67K could hold. 
That said, the recent drop has cleared the long liquidity at $68K. However, the next key liquidity was overhead, at $70K and $72K, as shown by Coinglass data. 
This meant that BTC could reverse the recent losses if it eyes the overhead liquidity. 
Source: Coinglass
The bullish scenario was also projected by crypto trading firm QCP Capital, who said,
“As we anticipate what the Fed has to say in this week’s FOMC meeting, the desk saw more near-dated bullish flows this session, with Call skew increasing over Puts.” 
This meant that the firm’s trading desk recorded more bullish bets (Call options) than bearish bets (Put options) on the derivatives market.
 The leading crypto options firm, Deribit, also reinforced QCP’s short-term bullish stance and noted, 
“Technical analysis indicates potential for a Bitcoin rally, with traders eyeing a bullish trend and considering Call Butterfly Spread strategies.”
However, a hawkish Fed will dent the bullish thesis and could lower BTC to $64K or range lows.

Recent data from Santiment shows that Litecoin had an average of approximately 704,000 unique addresses interacting on the network over the past week. This is a significant increase from the approximately 345,000 addresses observed over the entire month of May. The more than doubling of active addresses indicates growing interest and usage of the popular cryptocurrency.Network growth on the crypto market often precedes price increases. When more unique addresses are active, it indicates a higher number of transactions and greater overall usage. This increased activity can drive demand and push the price higher.  Source: SantimentAdditionally, when a network has a high number of active addresses it often reflects positive investor sentiment and interest in the native asset.Is Litecoin really undervalued?Litecoin, often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin's gold, is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created by Charlie Lee in 2011.

Arthur Hayes Unveils Big Aptos (APT) Prediction, Updates Outlook on Memecoin Sector - The Daily Hodl


								BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes just unveiled a massive prediction for Ethereum (ETH) competitor Aptos (APT).
In a new interview with Coin Bureau co-host Jessica Walker, Hayes predicts that layer-1 (L1) smart contract blockchain Aptos will overtake Solana (SOL) this market cycle.










“I’ll put this out there on this particular venue and I’ll qualify it with more information probably later this summer once I get back in the swing of things. Aptos flips Solana in the layer-1 game. I’ll put that out there. I’m not going to say any more than that.
I think Aptos could be the number two L1 over Solana within this cycle. That’s a one to three-year sort of prediction.” 
Aptos, with a market cap of $3.54 billion, is trading for $8.10 at time of writing, down 5.02% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Solana, with a market cap of $72.246 billion, is trading for $155 at time of writing, down 3.78% in the last 24 hours.
Hayes also predicts that memecoins are a sector of digital assets that are not going to go away.
“Memecoins are here to stay and are going to get even crazier as there’s more money printed. I’m in Singapore a lot and it’s a small place and a very homogenous society between the major ethnicities and every time I walk down Orchard Road to the shopping district to do some errands and walk by the Chanel store, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, all the mainstream big brands, there is always a line of local Singaporeans standing in line to buy whatever piece of alphabet that they want to put on their body… 
So if people are willing to stand in line to buy cowhide with ‘L’ and ‘V’ tattooed on it, then they certainly are going to sit on their computer and the Internet and trade whatever the memecoin is that’s hot this cycle because you don’t have to understand anything about crypto just like you have to understand anything about fashion. 
‘Everybody else likes it. I like it too. Very, very human. So I think memecoins are here to stay. For the person who’s just being initiated in the crypto, it’s like literally the easiest thing to understand. ‘Oh, yeah, that’s a cool image. That’s a really funny joke that I understand and everyone else is in on the joke and I can make money as the joke gains in virality. OK, cool. I’ll buy this memecoin.'”

Market expert sets next Bitcoin target after rejecting $71,000


    Cryptocurrency trading expert Michaël van de Poppe believes that Bitcoin (BTC) is destined for further correction after failing to breach the $71,000 resistance level. 



In an X post on June 11, Poppe identified several critical price levels and areas of interest for investors to watch. He pointed out that Bitcoin is expected to test the support range between $64,000 and $65,000. 



As per the analysis, this range is crucial as it could be a strong foundation for Bitcoin’s price to stabilize before attempting another upward move. Should the price drop below this immediate support, Poppe indicates a significant demand zone of $54,000 to $56,000. 







This area is marked as a key level where buyers will likely step in, providing substantial support to prevent further declines. On the upside, Bitcoin needs to break through multiple resistance levels, with the primary resistance now set at $71,000.

Successfully overcoming this barrier could pave the way for Bitcoin to retest its previous highs and potentially aim for new record levels.



Impact of CPI data



The analyst added that the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and the release of Consumer Price Index (CPI) data are critical events that could influence Bitcoin’s price movement. He anticipates that these events might trigger increased volatility in the market, potentially driving the next significant price action.




“Bitcoin continues to fall after rejecting the $71K area. Expecting that we’ll see tests at $64-65K before the markets are reversing back upwards due to the upcoming FOMC meeting & CPI data,” he said. 




The chart shows a consistent volume pattern, indicating steady trading activity. However, increased volume will be necessary to support a sustained upward move. 



On the other hand, crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that Bitcoin was trading within a well-defined parallel channel. According to Martinez, when Bitcoin trades in such a pattern, one should buy Bitcoin at the lower boundary and sell at the mid or upper boundary.



In this case, Bitcoin’s lower boundary is around $67,000, marked as a strong support level where buying opportunities are highlighted. The mid boundary is approximately $69,000, an intermediate point for partial profit-taking. The upper boundary is close to $71,000, which is identified as the resistance level where selling or taking profits is recommended.

It’s worth noting that Bitcoin attempted to break from the consolidation phase that has characterized the asset in recent days. The drop followed $64.9 million in outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The movement marked the first loss since at least May 23.



Bitcoin price analysis



Bitcoin was trading at $67,210 by press time, having plunged by over 3% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin is down 2.5%.

Overall, with bears seemingly taking charge of Bitcoin in the last 24 hours, the focus is on Bitcoin to sustain its price above $65,000, as dropping below this level will open room for further losses.

Bitcoin Plummets To $67K And 'This Move Isn't Over,' Warns Analyst - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD prices fell sharply during the Asian trading session today, dipping below $67,000 and raising concerns about a potential reversal in the recent bullish trend.What Happened: Data from TradingView recorded a 4% dip, bringing Bitcoin’s price to lows of $66,732 on Bitstamp following the daily close.The inability to maintain support at the critical $69,000 level has left Bitcoin bulls struggling against thin exchange order book liquidity. Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, highlighted the issue, stating, "Sure we have some laddered bid support in here, but not a heavy, heavy concentration of it — and really, it's not even heavy down to $60,000 if I can be completely honest."Alan’s comments, delivered during a recent YouTube update, were backed by data showing insufficient bids to support Bitcoin’s price. An accompanying chart from Material Indicators displayed order book liquidity for the BTC/USDT pair on Binance, the largest global crypto exchange. Following the latest downturn, Material Indicators noted on X that Bitcoin had officially rejected $69,000 as support and had also fallen below the 21-day moving average, a crucial short-term trendline."This move isn't over. In fact, I expect these killer whale games to continue up to and through JPow's comments on Wednesday and economic reports on Thursday," the post read, referring to upcoming statements from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.The anticipated volatility this week stems from key U.S. macroeconomic data releases, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), as well as the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision. Popular trader Skew noted that CPI/PPI data has historically been near the highs of its range, resulting in local lows for Bitcoin.Also Read: Financial Sector Dominates Q1 Crypto Funding With $323M InflowsIn a contrasting view, fellow trader and commentator Credible Crypto suggested that the current downtrend might not extend as far as $60,000.He observed that large-volume traders are dynamically adding and withdrawing liquidity, which could prevent Bitcoin’s price from falling below $65,000. "We continue to see spot absorption on each and every move down, even on lower timeframes," he shared with his X subscribers.Credible Crypto further highlighted that resistance at $72,000 had quickly dissipated once Bitcoin started to reverse. "What are the odds we front run range lows and 62-65k and just reverse from here? I think they are decent," he concluded, adding a note of cautious optimism.Adding to the bearish sentiment, June 10 saw the first net outflow of Bitcoin spot ETFs after 19 consecutive days of net inflows, totaling $64.9318 million, according to data from SoSo Value.Notably, Grayscale ETF GBTC experienced a significant single-day outflow of $39.5366 million. In contrast, Bitwise ETF BITB and BlackRock ETF IBIT had inflows of $7.5910 million and $6.3433 million, respectively.What’s Next: These developments come ahead of Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, which promises to delve deeper into these market dynamics and explore the future of cryptocurrency investments.Industry leaders and analysts will gather to discuss the evolving landscape of digital assets, providing crucial insights amid ongoing market fluctuations.Read Next: Crypto Adoption Is Coming ‘Slow And Steady,’ Research Report SaysImage: Shutterstock

Analyst: Ethereum Whale Activity Signals Bull Run


							

Analyst Sheldon Evans questions if the recent crypto dip is a bear trap.



Ethereum whales are accumulating, signaling potential strength.



Evans advises investors to prepare for potential buying opportunities.




Crypto analyst Sheldon Evans, also known as The Sniper, recently analyzed the crypto market, asking, “Is Crypto About to Drop 30% or Is This a Bear Trap?” 



He noted that while markets appeared promising on Friday, a sudden spike in volatility that night impacted several altcoins, including Phantom and Dogecoin, raising questions about Dogecoin’s potential entry point. Evans highlighted key factors to consider: Was this dip news-driven, influenced by high leverage, or the beginning of a downtrend?



Looking at higher time frames, Evans asserted that the recent pullback does not indicate a market reversal. He suggested that selling during downturns benefits institutional investors (“smart money”) who accumulate at lower prices.



The analyst also observed a trend where large holders of Ethereum (known as “whales”) have been increasing their holdings by 3% over the past three weeks, signaling a shift from weaker to stronger hands. He stated:




“3% of the guys that are holding more than 10,000 ethereum the Wales, okay, look. How they are increasing, look at this. You are seeing a pure, pure state of money going from weak hands to strong hands, every big DP off weak hands,” 




Furthermore, Evans mentioned the upcoming Ethereum ETF, drawing parallels to past events with Bitcoin, where price drops (“flush-outs”) occurred before significant bullish moves. He advised investors to remain focused and avoid making emotional decisions.









The analyst also discussed the possibility of a market dip to certain levels, such as $66,000 and $62,000 for Bitcoin. He emphasized the importance of having capital ready to invest at these points if they occur. Evans further urged investors to use stop-loss orders and consider closing positions above the candle wick for improved risk management.



While recommending to take profits in trading accounts to secure gains, Evans remained optimistic about a bullish scenario, viewing recent events as a potential trap set by institutional investors to drive prices upward.

Bitcoin Lightning Network and Layer 2 Scaling Could Be 'Abused by Criminals', Says EU - Decrypt

A new report from the EU has singled out Bitcoin's Lightning Network and other layer 2 solutions as "data obfuscation" technologies that could be "abused by criminals."The First Report on Encryption by the EU Innovation Hub for Internal Security, a "collaborative network of innovation labs" from across EU member states, argues that alongside technologies including Mimblewimble, zero-knowledge (zk) proofs, coin mixers and privacy coins such as Monero and Zcash, "layer 2 solutions such as the lightning network might also be abused by criminals."The report notes that the Lightning Network's "two-party multisignature payment channels will not broadcast all transactions to the blockchain, but only the opening and closing of the channel," adding that it and other layer 2 solutions could cause cause "problems for law enforcement investigations."Privacy coins and law enforcementThe report also takes aim at coin mixers such as Tornado Cash, and privacy coins including Monero, Zcash, Grin and Dash.It highlights their use of "zero-knowledge proofs and layer 2 solutions" that enable some transaction data to be obscured, which "significantly complicates tracing the origins of (illicit) cryptocurrency for law enforcement."Cryptographic protocol Mimblewimble, used by cryptocurrencies including Grin, Beam and Litecoin, is considered a "complicating factor," in law enforcement's efforts to trace cryptocurrency transactions, though the report's authors conced that, "transactions using Mimblewimble are not frequently encountered."Privacy coins have been subject to regulatory pressure from governments in recent months.The EU's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, which comes into force at the end of 2024, cracks down on interactions between crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) and privacy coins, prompting crypto exchanges such as Binance to delist them.Crypto mixers have also come under pressure from law enforcement agencies around the world, with Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev found guilty of money laundering by a Dutch court.In April, U.S. authorities arrested and charged the founders of Bitcoin mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering. The crackdown has had a chilling effect on other privacy tools, with several coin mixing services abandoning the U.S. in the wake of the Samourai Wallet arrests.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitcoin boom: 7.3 million new BTC addresses added in H1 2024


    As the first half of 2024 nears its end, the full impact of the cryptocurrency bull market is becoming increasingly evident.



Indeed, after the crypto market endured a protracted period of pressure characterized by depressed prices and high regulatory scrutiny, the false rumors of a digital asset exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in October 2023 kickstarted their recovery – a recovery that was only strengthened with actual spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs, approved in the United States in January 2024.



Finbold research revealed that, by June 11, 2024, the rally generated a significant spike in interest, which led to a major increase in the number of addresses holding BTC.





In fact, at the time of publication, nearly 85 million addresses held at least $1 worth of Bitcoin—at least 1,400 Sats.



Historical snapshots, made available through the use of the web archive tool Wayback Machine, reveal that on January 4 – the earliest 2024 date available – the total number of such addresses stood at approximately 77.5 million.








7.3 million new noteworthy Bitcoin addresses were created in H1 2024



Juxtaposing the two figures reveals that, in just under six months, as many as 7.3 million new Bitcoin addresses were added – 1.2 million each month and 46,000 each day, for a total increase of 9.51%.



The number of BTC millionaires – addresses holding more than $1 million worth of the cryptocurrency – also increased substantially. 



During the first half of 2024, the number rose nearly 30,000 from 96,736 to 126,733.



However, the 2024 rise in the number of Bitcoin millionaires reveals an interesting phenomenon.



Research conducted by Finbold throughout 2023 demonstrates that the number of such BTC holders grew by 70,000 in the 12-month period. Additionally, figures analyzed and published in April 2023 demonstrate that the number of Bitcoin millionaires increased by more than 50,000 in the year’s first quarter (Q1).



Given the current trends, 2024 is set to add approximately 10,000 fewer BTC millionaires than 2023, despite the significant enthusiasm and volume generated by the bull market.



Simultaneously, 2023 saw the addition of approximately 23 million new Bitcoin addresses holding at least. $1 worth of the cryptocurrency.



At the pace observed during its first half, 2024 will add only about 60% as many such addresses as the previous year.



Are traders abandoning Bitcoin due to BTC price stagnation?



A possible explanation for the phenomenon is that the first half of 2023 offered a longer period of growth for Bitcoin at an arguably more compelling price as the world’s premier cryptocurrency was recovering from protracted trading near $15,000.



Indeed, though BTC rose to only about $30,000 in the time frame, the climb was more steady and continuous. 



Compared to that, the 2024 rise was both more staggering and more brief. Bitcoin reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,084 on March 13 –  before the end of the first quarter – and has mostly been trading sideways in the rough range between $67,000 and $71,000 since.



A strong move in either direction could likely reignite the skyrocketing in the number of Bitcoin-holding addresses.



A bullish breakout would confirm that BTC has not yet achieved its full potential in 2024, while a price collapse would create an enticing buying opportunity for investors.



Reinforcing the notion is the fact that the total number of such addresses largely stagnated between May 22 and June 11, and the number of BTC millionaires dropped by approximately 2,000.



It is worth noting, however, that a single user can have multiple addresses, meaning that the rise in the total number of addresses does not necessarily fully correspond to the total number of traders.



Simultaneously, the January approval of BTC ETFs in the U.S. may have inverted the logic and may also explain the relatively slow growth compared to 2023. 



Major financial institutions that operate the funds – such as BlackRock – may hold vast amounts of BTC associated with numerous investors in a single address.

Crypto Volatility Rises with Upcoming US Inflation Data


The crypto market has been experiencing significant volatility as the US Federal Reserve prepares to release updated economic projections this week.
Despite slower growth, market watchers and investors expect these projections to show fewer interest rate cuts.
JPMorgan and Citi Abandon July Rate Cut Forecasts

The Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, has warned that actual outcomes may vary. Unexpected economic conditions have challenged the Fed’s recent forecasts.
While key inflation measures have remained steady after aggressive rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, economic risks are now more nuanced, with data often contradictory. For instance, US firms added 272,000 jobs in May, and wages rose at a 4.1% annual rate. However, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4%.
Read more: How to Protect Yourself From Inflation Using Cryptocurrency


“In recent months, there has been a lack of further progress toward the Committee’s 2% inflation objective,” The Fed wrote after its last meeting on May 1.

Consequently, the Fed is cautious about rate cuts until inflation significantly improves. Policymakers question whether inflation can hit the 2% target without tight monetary policy. The Fed’s approach to rate cuts contrasts with some global counterparts, like the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of Canada (BoC), which have recently cut rates. According to Wall Street Journal reporter Nick Timiraos, JPMorgan and Citigroup abandoned their forecasts for a July rate cut after last Friday’s jobs report.

“Most sell-side economists and other professional Fed watchers now anticipate one or two rate cuts this year in either September or December,” he added.

In addition to JPMorgan and Citigroup, various financial institutions have projected their expectations for Fed interest rate cuts in 2024. Most projections indicate a first-rate cut happening as early as September, while some expect it as late as December.

Matteo Greco, a research analyst at Fineqia, shared his perspective on this current situation with BeInCrypto. He explained that less restrictive monetary policies are generally favorable for risk-on assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. This is especially relevant when rate cuts do not foreshadow an impending recession.


“In this case, the central bank’s decision to cut rates despite higher-than-target inflation suggests optimism about managing inflation and maintaining it near desired levels even with more expansionary monetary policies,” he noted.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $67,482, down 2.8% over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) decreased by 3.9% and 3.4% in the same period. The total crypto market capitalization now stands at $2.59 trillion, representing a 2.7% decrease over the same period.

Indeed, these developments are crucial for crypto traders and investors. The Fed’s decisions on interest rates directly impact market liquidity, borrowing costs, and overall economic conditions, all of which influence crypto market dynamics.

Good News for the First Users of the Ethereum Layer 2 Network! Airdrop of 3.6 Billion Tokens is Coming! - Bitcoin Sistemi

ZKsync Association will mark a major event in the crypto community next week by distributing 3.675 billion ZK tokens to early users and adopters of the Ethereum Layer 2 network.
ZKsync Will Airdrop 3.6 Billion Tokens to Early Users and Participants
This airdrop accounts for 17.5% of the total supply of 21 billion ZK tokens. According to ZKsync, the tokens will be available to claim starting next week and the deadline to claim will be January 3, 2025. Participants can start submitting requests starting June 24.


Distribution and Management
49.1% of the total token supply will be distributed through various ecosystem initiatives, while 17.2% will be allocated to investors and 16.1% to the Matter Labs team.





“Giving more tokens in the airdrop than given to the Matter Labs team and investors is more than a symbolic decision for the community,” the ZKsync Association said.
“When the ZKsync governance system launches in the coming weeks, the community will have the largest supply of liquid tokens to drive protocol governance upgrades.”



Eligibility and Allocation
ZKsync listed 695,232 wallets for the airdrop based on a snapshot taken on March 24, 2024. Airdrop is divided into two categories:





Users (89%) and contributors (11%). Users are those who meet a certain threshold of activity on ZKsync, while contributors include developers, researchers, and community members who actively support the ecosystem.
Additional Allocations
The remaining community allocation will be managed by the ZKsync Foundation and distributed over time through ecosystem initiatives and the ZK Nation governance process.

Experimental communities, including wallets that engage in certain activities in decentralized social networks and NFT projects, will receive slightly less than half a percent of the supply.
Token Vesting and Locking
ZK tokens allocated to investors and the Matter Labs team will be locked for the first year and then gradually unlocked over the next three years, from June 2025 to June 2028.

SubQuery launches first decentralized RPCs for Polkadot and Kusama

SubQuery Network, a Web3 infrastructure provider, has introduced two new decentralized Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) for efficient data management on the Polkadot and Kusama networks, according to a June 11 statement shared with CryptoSlate.SubQuery said these RPCs are the first decentralized ones on Substrate-based networks and will be operated by over 30 independent Node Operators. This will allow developers to build blockchain projects that can function efficiently and access data from multiple sources.SubQuery’s RPCsRPCs are crucial for communication between blockchain nodes and external entities as they facilitate data retrieval, smart contract interactions, and transaction submissions.Additionally, the availability of decentralized RPCs frees decentralized applications (dApps) from relying on centralized middleware, ensuring secure and efficient Web3 communication. Notably, these features enable operational transparency, which is essential for the success of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs).James Bayly, SubQuery’s COO, expressed enthusiasm about the RPCs’ deployment. He noted that the node operators, already experienced in running RPCs and other nodes in various ecosystems, are well-positioned to support Polkadot developers. He added:“Our node operators are already running RPCs and other nodes in multiple ecosystems, and, having emerged from the Polkadot ecosystem, we’re ideally placed to support Polkadot developers with their infrastructure.”SubQuery, which started in the Polkadot ecosystem with an indexer to connect multi-chain architectures, has since become a leading Web3 data indexer. It now supports hundreds of networks, providing Web3 infrastructure for about 200 globally distributed networks of decentralized indexers and RPC providers. This allows dApps to access blockchain data without centralized control points.Notably, its technology has been adopted by major crypto organizations like the OKX exchange, which integrated it with its Layer 2 testnet in February.Disclaimer: CryptoSlate has received a grant from the Polkadot Foundation to produce content about the Polkadot ecosystem.

Maybe Old-Fashioned Venture Capital Wasn't So Bad After All

Maybe it’s time that we start to examine which investors are looking to do 100x-1000x on their investments over a decade, and which ones are looking to do smaller returns over a shorter period of time. The former is the one that will lead to consumer adoption, because we need to educate people why blockchain is better for consumers, build the products, launch them, get regulators on board, and actually be in a place where the blockchains can handle the traffic, all of which take time. The latter will only continue to further enrich already wealthy VCs, which is the opposite of what we need.

Doxxing and Conspiracy Theories: Roaring Kitty Fans Are Getting Carried Away - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsModerators on the Roaring Kitty-endorsed subreddit SuperStonk have had to issue a warning to its community to stop doxxing the meme stock influencer and his family.“We've noticed a HUGE uptick in pictures of [Roaring Kitty’s] family, including his wife/sibling(s),” the community post read. “They're totally unrelated to his activity as an investor and streamer, and his family and friends deserve their privacy. Posting their photos... honestly it's a little creepy and violates their privacy. Don't do it.”Fans of the GameStop investor are clearly getting carried away. The post explains that the moderators aren’t sure whether the posts are meant to be “sweet” or “malicious”—but either way, they’re wrong. His followers tend to worship him like a financial deity, posting that they miss him only hours after he last posted.Keith Gill, better known as Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue, returned to Reddit by posting his GameStop positions on the SuperStonk subreddit last week. He sent the GME price rallying after he scheduled his first livestream in three years and then hosted it—with an audience of 700,000—while his GameStop investment dropped in value.This level of fandom, combined with his trademark cryptic social media posts, has not only led to doxxing concerns but also widespread conspiracy theories. On Monday, Roaring Kitty poked fun at his GME losses with a meme of a man pointing intently at himself in a mirror with the caption “You were a billionaire.” While many thought this was a jovial gag, the Kitty conspiracy clan looked deeper.They theorize that the mirror at which the man is pointing is in fact a two-way mirror, suggesting that he is not pointing at himself but rather someone behind. “Glad I’m not the only one who thought this about it being a two-way mirror when I saw the post,” one Reddit user commented.In the comments to the post, people are diving even deeper into the mirror metaphor with “mirror trading” being highlighted by one Reddit user. Mirror trading is when an investor copies another more experienced investor, like many Roaring Kitty fans have been doing.Meanwhile, fans over on Twitter have dug up old posts by Roaring Kitty which, they believe, suggests that he is about to swap his allegiance with GameStop to focus on another popular meme stock: AMC. This all comes back to a Twitter post from March 16, which references the Kansas City Shuffle, using a clip from Lucky Number Slevin. This is a bait-and-switch trick which, theorists believe, is the “financial markets” misdirecting investors into focusing on GameStop before switching to AMC. This theory is compounded by the viewers noticing that Roaring Kitty was wearing the same hand wrap which Bruce Willis’ character wears in Lucky Number Slevin.Whether theorists believe that Roaring Kitty is the one behind this bait-and-switch is unclear, but they’re continuing to dig.

LTC rises: Litecoin surpasses Bitcoin and Ethereum in network activity


    Litecoin (LTC) surpassed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in an important metric that indicates network activity, userbase, and demand. For the first time in early June, Litecoin registered more daily active addresses than the two most valuable cryptocurrencies.



Notably, Litecoin saw a 110% surge in its daily active addresses in the last seven days, reaching 728,000. Finbold retrieved this data from Santiment on June 11, with Bitcoin’s 593,000 and Ethereum’s 419,000 daily active addresses.

However, Tether U.S. dollar stablecoin (USDT) still vastly dominates the market in terms of daily active address (DAA) count. Moreover, Bitcoin and Ethereum have a larger network activity average in the last 30 days, according to Santiment‘s screener.







On that note, USDT on the BNB Chain (BNB) alone registers a 781,140 DAA. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin have 653,510, 466,770, and 465,720, respectively.

Litecoin price analysis amid increased network activity



From a fundamental analysis perspective, the growth of network activity highlights an increased demand for the solution Litecoin provides. More active addresses could suggest the user base is growing, which has the potential to impact LTC’s spot price.



From a technical analysis perspective, however, LTC struggles in a price range between $77 and $88, currently at $78.83. Interestingly, it trades close to the range’s support and below the 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA) of $82.76.



Furthermore, the daily relative strength index (RSI) indicates weak momentum for Litecoin despite the remarkable network activity.



LTC/USD daily chart. TradingView / Finbold



As of this writing, LTC has a market cap of $5.88 billion. This is 225 times lower than BTC’s $1.32 trillion and 72 times lower than ETH’s $422.71 billion.



Nevertheless, daily active addresses are not a conclusive indicator to measure network activity and other factors should be taken into consideration while evaluating demand and each cryptocurrency’s user base. Bitcoin has registered an all-time low on-chain transaction and spot trading volume while record-breaking speculative demand via derivatives like futures and exchange-traded funds.



Investors must be cautious and follow further developments in the cryptocurrency market and industry to improve decision-making.

Ripple Launches Massive Fund For XRP Ledger In East Asia


								Ripple announced the creation of the XRPL Japan and Korea Fund on June 11, 2024, marking a major strategic move to deepen its engagement with blockchain innovation in East Asia. This initiative is part of a broader commitment from Ripple, allocating 1 billion XRP (worth approximately $490 million) to support various activities that catalyze the growth and development of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem.
Emi Yoshikawa, Vice President of Strategic Initiatives at Ripple, described the fund as crucial to the company’s strategy in the region. “The launch of this fund is a testament to Ripple’s strong belief in the potential of Japan and Korea as pivotal regional hubs for blockchain innovation,” Yoshikawa stated. She further elaborated on the specific aspects of the fund aimed at enhancing the XRP Ledger’s utility and adoption in these markets.
Key Focus Areas For Ripple’s XRPL Japan And Korea Fund
1. Corporate Partnerships: The fund aims to forge partnerships with leading Japanese and Korean corporations to facilitate the integration of the XRP Ledger into their operations. These partnerships will explore a range of enterprise use cases across multiple industries, leveraging XRPL’s capabilities to solve real-world business challenges.

2. Developer Grants: In an effort to stimulate technological innovation, the fund will provide financial, technical, and business support to developers working on promising projects on the XRPL. This initiative not only offers funding but also aims to create a nurturing environment for developers to bring their innovative ideas to fruition.
3. Startup Investments: Recognizing the potential of early-stage companies, Ripple plans to invest in startups that are using the XRPL to develop new applications. These investments will target companies that demonstrate the potential to add significant value to the XRPL ecosystem.
4. Community Growth: To build and sustain robust local communities around the XRPL, the fund will support various community-oriented events and activities. These include local hackathons, educational programs, and other events designed to engage community members and foster a deeper understanding and proficiency in XRPL technologies.
Projects And Partnerships
The fund has already facilitated significant projects, such as VWBL in Japan and Moai Finance in Korea. VWBL is working on a ‘Viewable’ Protocol that uses NFTs to encapsulate and authenticate encrypted data for real-world applications like medical exams. This protocol allows for condition-based access control and operates across multiple blockchains, enhancing data security and accessibility.

Moai Finance, on the other hand, is focused on improving the fluidity and utility of assets within the XRPL community through a multi-chain decentralized exchange and cross-chain DEX aggregator. Their products aim to facilitate easier asset swapping and liquidity provision across different blockchains.
Ripple’s partnerships in the region, such as the one with SBI Holdings to establish SBI Taiwan Asia and its strategic alliance with HashKey DX, illustrate the firm’s long-term commitment to these markets. Additionally, Ripple’s participation in major industry events and its active role in community-building activities underscore its strategic intentions.
Upcoming events where Ripple executives will participate, such as WebX Asia and Korea Blockchain Week, along with community events in Seoul and Tokyo, will further promote the XRPL and its applications. Furthermore, the use of XRPL for issuing official NFTs at the World Expo 2025 in Osaka highlights the practical utility and growing acceptance of Ripple’s technologies in large-scale, global events.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.48432.

Thailand's SEC Revokes Crypto Exchange Zipmex's Operating License


							

The Finance Minister revoked Zipmex’s digital asset business license.



Zipmex failed to rectify issues related to its operation as previously outlined by the SEC.



Zipmex must transfer assets back to customers within 15 days.




Thailand’s Finance Minister, acting on a recommendation from the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission, has revoked the digital asset business license of crypto exchange Zipmex.



The revocation took effect on May 28, 2024. According to local media, the decision stemmed from concerns over the company’s financial condition and management structure, which could potentially harm customers.



Specifically, a recent SEC report revealed that Zipmex, which held licenses as a digital asset trading center and broker, exhibited financial and managerial deficiencies that did not meet the standards set by the Digital Asset Decree of 2018. These shortcomings raised concerns about the company’s ability to operate efficiently and responsibly.



In January, the SEC Committee ordered Zipmex to rectify its operations. However, the company failed to do so within the given timeframe. Consequently, in February, the SEC Committee ordered Zipmex to suspend its crypto business and address various operational issues, including returning assets to customers upon request.









Following further evaluation on February 21, the SEC Committee found that Zipmex had not only disregarded the initial orders but also failed to make the required corrections. This led to the recommendation to the Minister of Finance to revoke Zipmex’s license and order the cessation of its digital asset business operations.



Zipmex has been instructed to return assets to customers within 15 days. If customers do not claim their assets within this period, Zipmex must secure them in a safeguarded system within 30 days and promptly report each step to the SEC.

Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO) Falls Short of EPS, Revenue Forecasts in Q1 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASO) has released its first-quarter results for 2024, revealing a mixed performance. The company’s net sales declined by 1.4%, while comparable sales dropped by 5.7%. Despite these declines, Academy managed to achieve a GAAP diluted EPS of $1.01 and an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.08. The quarter also saw the opening of two new stores, and the company returned $132 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.



The dip in net sales and comparable sales indicates a challenging retail environment for Academy Sports and Outdoors. Various market conditions, including consumer spending behavior and economic factors, could have contributed to these declines. 



Academy Sports and Outdoors Inc Falls Short of EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



When comparing the current quarter’s performance against expectations, Academy Sports and Outdoors fell short. Analysts had projected an EPS of $1.23 and revenue of $1.38 billion for the quarter. The actual EPS of $1.01, or $1.08 on an adjusted basis, is below the anticipated figure. Similarly, the company’s net sales did not meet the expected revenue target, reflecting a shortfall in achieving market forecasts.



This gap between actual performance and expectations highlights potential areas of concern for investors. The lower-than-expected EPS and revenue figures may prompt questions regarding the company’s sales strategies and market positioning. 





Academy Sports Cautious on Guidance



Looking ahead, Academy Sports and Outdoors provided guidance that aims to address these challenges and outline a path for future growth. The company emphasized its focus on enhancing customer experience and expanding its product offerings. Additionally, strategic initiatives such as store expansions and digital transformation are expected to play a crucial role in driving future performance.



The company’s commitment to returning value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends remains a key aspect of its financial strategy.

OpenAI hires co-founder of Facebook’s failed Libra crypto project


OpenAI announced that it has hired the co-founder of Facebook’s failed Libra crypto project on the same day that tech giant Apple revealed new integration between ChatGPT and its Siri artificial intelligence.
The San Francisco-based firm announced on Monday that former Facebook Libra exec Kevin Weil will become its new chief product officer. Sarah Friar, the former chief financial officer of Square, will also join OpenAI as chief financial officer.   
The tech firm said that Weil “will lead a product team focused on applying our research to products and services that benefit consumers, developers, and businesses.” 

Facebook launched the Libra project in 2019 as an open-source digital currency. It then rebranded to Diem in December 2020 as the firm reportedly sought to distance itself from the social media platform and woo US regulators. 
Regulators were concerned that the stablecoin project could be used for money laundering and worried about its impact on monetary stability. They also raised concerns that stablecoin-specific regulation wouldn’t be ready before Facebook released Diem to its billions of users. 
The project ultimately failed to gain regulatory approval and Facebook shuttered Diem in January 2022, selling $200 million worth of assets to Silvergate Bank.

Apple also announced its new partnership with OpenAI on Monday. The deal will see OpenAI lend its ChatGPT artificial intelligence to Apple where it will be incorporated into the firm’s Siri assistant.
OpenAI CEO and co-founder Sam Altman said on X (formerly Twitter) that he was “Very happy to be partnering with Apple to integrate ChatGPT into their devices later this year! think you will really like it.”
Sam Altmans’s crypto-focused identity project Worldcoin has also hired a new executive with a crypto past. Coinbases’s former head of corporate communications, Elliott Suthers, was announced yesterday and will be joining Worldcoin as its head of comms for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

Famous Bitcoin Maximalist Samson Mow Explained the Inevitable End of BTC with a Graphic! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Famous Bitcoin supporter Samson Mow explained what fate inevitably awaits the Bitcoin price
Samson Mow Made Important Bitcoin (BTC) Statement
Samson Mow, Bitcoin maximalist and CEO of Jan3, published a BTC-themed post on his account on the X platform


Samson Mow, the boss of Jan3, a company focused on Bitcoin adoption, published a diagram showing the ratio of Bitcoin in circulation so far and potentially minted through mining, compared to the current capital in the market.
There are no numbers in this diagram, but it visually makes it clear that the amount of BTC available is very small compared to the available capital that can be used to purchase it. Both the capital and Bitcoin are depicted in a triangular shape and together they look like an hourglass.






“As you watch the Bitcoin price fall, remember where it inevitably goes,” Mow tweeted today, thus making a bullish BTC price prediction.
Mow is one of the maximalists who expects the world's flagship cryptocurrency to eventually reach the $1 million per coin price level.


However, Mow also shared his surprise at the current Bitcoin decline despite the staggering level of adoption currently observable:
“It feels strange to see the price of Bitcoin falling while we are at an unprecedented level of adoption. BTFD!” BTFD stands for “buy the friendly dip.”

BNB or Cardano? We asked ChatGPT which asset is a better buy for the second half of 2024


    In a year marked by significant volatility in the cryptocurrency market, BNB Chain (BNB) and Cardano (ADA) have emerged as two key players. 



With BNB hitting all-time highs and Cardano showing renewed vigor through strategic advancements, investors are keen to know which asset promises better returns in the coming months.



Inlight of these positive outlooks, Finbold turned to ChatGPT-4o to determine which might be the better investment for the second half of 2024.







Key factors driving the positive outlook



BNB has demonstrated remarkable resilience, recently hitting an all-time high despite market corrections. According to ChatGPT, BNB remains one of the top performers post-2022 bear market.



Despite a recent 12% correction, the altcoin shows sustained strength with high trading volumes and a strong bullish outlook from analysts. 



The combination of social media buzz and active trading underpins BNB’s robust market position, suggesting that its upward trajectory may continue.



BNB continues to attract significant investor interest, with some analysts predicting an 800% price increase from current levels. Its popularity is further supported by high social volume and substantial trading activity on Binance’s platforms, indicating strong market confidence and engagement.



Cardano, often criticized for its stagnant price action, is now showing renewed vigor. The total number of Cardano transactions has reached 91 million, averaging between 50,000 and 70,000 daily. This increase in activity coincides with the upcoming Cardano Node 9.0 update, which promises significant enhancements to the blockchain. 



Additionally, a strategic partnership with the government of Entre Ríos Province in Argentina aims to boost blockchain adoption and drive ADA’s recovery.



ChatGPT-4o:Short-term gains vs. Long-term value



According to ChatGPT-4, BNB (Binance Coin) is the preferred choice for investors seeking short-term gains. This is due to its recent performance, market stability, and bullish outlook. Its resilience and high growth potential make it an attractive option for those looking to capitalize on immediate market movements.



For investors focused on long-term value, Cardano emerges as a strong candidate. Cardano’s ongoing development activities, strategic partnerships, and potential for substantial growth position it as a promising investment. Those willing to weather short-term volatility may find significant long-term gains with Cardano.

Current market performance



At press time, BNB is trading at $609 with a year-to-date (YTD) gain of 95%, while ADA is trading at $0.429 with a YTD loss of 27%.

After a major increase, BNB’s price struggled near the $720 resistance. As a result, there was a bearish reaction below the $680 support.



Analysts see a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $650 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. A clear move above the $650 zone could send the price higher. 



While both BNB and Cardano present distinct investment opportunities, diversifying investments between both assets could be a prudent strategy to mitigate risks and capitalize on the strengths of each coin. 



By balancing investments between these two assets, investors can take advantage of the unique benefits each cryptocurrency offers, positioning themselves for both immediate gains and sustained growth.

Moody’s Drops Bombshell On Crypto Industry Amid High Interest Rate Cuts | Bitcoinist.com


								Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi has given his opinion on a potential interest rate cut ahead of the US Fed’s decision. The crypto community is closely monitoring this event, given how it could impact the crypto market. 
The US Fed Should Cut Interest Rates
Zandi mentioned during an interview with Bloomberg that he believes the Fed should be looking to cut interest rates. He made this remark while stating that the financial conditions are where they need to be with the Fed achieving its goal of bringing inflation down to a considerable level. He also alluded to the employment rate, which shows that the US Fed shouldn’t hold out on interest rates for this long. 

The Fed favors the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index as its go-to inflation indicator and has set a target of 2% for the inflation rate. However, Zandi questioned this move as he suggested that 2% isn’t the right number and should probably be higher. He also remarked that there was no point in the US Fed sacrificing the economy to the “alter of the 2% inflation target.”
The US Fed’s FOMC meeting will be between June 12 and 13, during which it will also decide whether or not to cut interest rates. Data from The CME FedWatch Tool shows a 99.4% probability that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged. These interest rates significantly impact the crypto market since lower interest rates will boost investors’ confidence to invest in risk assets like cryptocurrencies. 
Initial projections were that the Fed would cut interest rates by the middle of the year, which presented a bullish outlook for the crypto market. However, that is now unlikely, with the Federal Reserve still looking unsatisfied with the current economic situation. This has also led financial analysts at JPMorgan and Citi to scrap their initial projections and predict that the interest rate cut will come in September or November. 
Some Positives To Hold On To For Crypto
There are still some positives to hold on to even though the US Federal Reserve is unlikely to slash interest rates at the upcoming FOMC meeting or the one in July. For one, the Spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to begin trading later this month or by early July. These funds will likely spark another run for the crypto market just like the Spot Bitcoin ETFs did. 

Additionally, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs are again in the green and are seeing impressive demand for their respective funds. The inflows into the Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Spot Ethereum ETFs could be the catalyst needed for the continuation of the bull run in the crypto market. Meanwhile, the sentiment in the market will undoubtedly become more bullish if the US Federal Reserve eventually cuts interest rates in September or October as predicted.

"EigenLayer was effectively, on a discretionary basis, limiting the amount of steETH that could go into their middleware—rather arbitrarily, in my view," said adcv. "I expect that this type of restriction will become more and more rare in the future, because from the perspective of a restaking provider, you don't want to put any sort of breaks on your ability to raise capital."

It also bolsters the company’s enterprise infrastructure, improving services for institutional clients.This acquisition is the firm’s second largest in the past year, following the acquisition of Metaco, another institutional crypto custody platform, in May last year. Ripple stated:“Both moves underscore the growing breadth and importance of digital assets; from stablecoins and CBDCs to tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate and more.”The company said it will continue leveraging its strong financial position to pursue further acquisitions and strengthen its leadership in the blockchain space.Appoints Vice-president for stablecoinsJack McDonald will continue as CEO of Standard Custody and also serve as its Senior Vice President of Stablecoins.

Warning - Beware of Crypto Romance Scams!


                                FTC Raises Awareness About Crypto Investment Scams in Romance                                Online dating has become the standard in today's fast-moving world, but unfortunately, not everyone you meet on dating apps or social media has pure intentions. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is raising awareness about a troubling new pattern – cryptocurrency romance scams.These scams start innocently enough. You match with someone online who seems perfectly normal. They're charming, attentive, and you quickly develop a connection. As you get to know them better over video chats and messaging, they tell a story of being a successful cryptocurrency investor. Seeing your potential new love interest as knowledgeable and financially smart, you become interested when they suggest exploring crypto investing together.FTC Warns of Romance Scams Involving Crypto Investments"It's a classic case of love being blind," explains by fraud investigator with the FTC. "These scammers are masters of manipulation. They invest a tremendous amount of time and effort into building your trust and making you feel like you've finally met 'the one.' By the time they bring up crypto investments, you're already deeply interested and ready to go along with whatever they suggest."The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) put out a warning for people about dealing with situations where someone they've met online romantically gives investment advice. The alert was written by Colleen Tressler from the Division of Consumer and Business Education, and it talks about how scammers pretend to be romantic partners to trick people into giving them money.Love Interest or Crypto Scammer? Know the SignsThat's when things take a dark turn. Your new love interest will pressure you to invest in the cryptocurrency of their choice, promising unbelievable returns with no risk. They'll insist on walking you through every step, from setting up a digital wallet to transferring funds. Before you know it, you've spent your savings to buy into what you believed was a safe, profitable opportunity recommended by someone you cared about deeply.Except that the ideal companion was a character carefully molded by criminal scammers. And those cryptocurrency investments? Nothing more than a scheme to drain you of every cent you had."Once the money is gone, they disappear into thin air," states with a serious tone. "Victims not only feel extremely sad financially but emotionally betrayed by someone they trusted deeply."Crypto Romance Scams Surge with $185M Lost in 2023The FTC's latest data shows that crypto romance scams or crypto scams have soared in recent years, with reported losses exceeding $185 million in just the first quarter of 2023 alone. Authorities point to a perfect storm of factors, including the rise of online dating, increasing crypto adoption, and people's general lack of understanding about how cryptocurrency works."Let's be honest, cryptocurrency is still a mystery to most people," says one tech analyst. "That knowledge gap creates an open door for scammers to take advantage. They present themselves as crypto experts who can help victims get in on the ground floor of the next big investment opportunity."According to the FTC, these scammers tend to follow a pattern of love-bombing their victims with excessive compliments, communicating consistently, and making impressive promises about their future lives together. They're uncompromising in taking advantage of people's emotional weaknesses for financial gain.So, how can you keep yourself safe from falling for one of these tricky schemes? Experts recommend being cautious whenever an online romantic interest begins talking about crypto investments. Genuine financial advisors don't start relationships on dating sites just to get clients. If something sounds too amazing to be real, it most likely is.Beware – Online Romance and Crypto Don't MixMy advice is simple – love and money don't mix. If you've only known someone a short time online, don't trust them with your life savings, no matter how convincing their story might be. Crypto investments should always be followed through proper, verified channels, not based on the encouragement of a romantic partner you hardly know.By issuing this call to action, the FTC hopes to raise awareness and save more people from the heartbreak and financial damage caused by crypto romance scams. In the end, real love is about trust, respect, and protecting your shared future together – not making someone you've never met rich off your hard-earned money.Also read - Solana's Surgical Strike to Stop Sandwich Attacks

Altcoins Down 70% Against Bitcoin: Here's Why They Just Can't Get Going - Benzinga

Bitcoin‘s BTC/USD recent run-up close to all-time highs has failed to spur an equivalent rally in altcoins—a sign that  the market is far from an altcoin bull run, according to a renowned crypto analyst.What Happened: In a detailed series of tweets, Miles Deutscher highlighted the significant underperformance in altcoins and the apparent contradiction in market sentiment."At first glance, you’d think crypto sentiment would be euphoric right now," he tweeted, pointing out that while Bitcoin is nearing its all-time highs, and meme coins are gaining traction, the reality is different.“Most retail doesn’t hold large amounts of Bitcoin – they’re in alts. And alts have been significantly underperforming thus far this cycle.”Supporting his claim, Deutscher presented data showing that the OTHERS/BTC ratio, which excludes the top 10 coins, is lower than it was eight months ago.Another trader pointed out that since the bankruptcy of FTX, only eight coins have made a new all-time high against Bitcoin. Notably, the list does not feature major altcoins like Solana SOL/USD, Ripple XRP/USD, Cardano ADA/USD, Polkadot DOT/USD or even Ethereum ETH/USDThis underperformance is further evidenced by the fact that crypto YouTube views have significantly lagged behind Bitcoin prices, with views dropping from 4 million per day in 2021 to just 800,000 per day in 2024.Deutscher highlighted that altcoins are still 70% away from their previous highs compared to Bitcoin, pointing out that alts “haven’t had a sustained rally” since Bitcoin’s thrust upwards starting in October 2023.Also Read: Bitcoin Plummets To $67K And ‘This Move Isn’t Over,’ Warns AnalystWhy It Matters: Deutscher attributes the current market dynamics to several factors.
He describes the cycle as Bitcoin-narrative led, driven by the spot ETF narrative and strong inflows.



Specific sectors such as memes, AI, and real-world assets (RWA) have outperformed, while major altcoins lag.



Market dilution is at an all-time high, with nearly 1 million new crypto tokens created in May alone.



Lastly, token unlocks are adding continuous sell pressure, with around $200 million worth of unlocks per day.
Addressing the future of the market, Deutscher speculated on a potential turnaround. He noted that in previous cycles, altcoins peaked 546 days post-halving, suggesting a possible peak in October 2025 for this cycle. However, he also acknowledged the possibility of an earlier peak due to various factors such as cycle acceleration and macroeconomic conditions. "During the 1st half of the cycle it's natural for Bitcoin to take the lead. In fact, this is HEALTHY for market structure," he stated, emphasizing that altcoins typically outperform in the latter stages of the run.Crypto trader Cred also chimed in with an analysis of the uneven distribution of returns this cycle. He pointed out that traditional risk curves and market behaviors have been less profitable, with meme coins on blockchains like Solana taking the lead instead.“The rising tide has not lifted all boats and there are very clear winners vs losers,” Cred noted, highlighting the challenges faced by traders with differing strategies and risk appetites.Eugene Ng Ah Sio, another crypto analyst, summarized the cycle’s progression, noting significant price movements in late 2023, followed by a reset in early 2024, and a large deleveraging event in the second quarter of 2024.He emphasized the mental strain on market participants and suggested a possible interim cycle bottom in June, with a better outlook for the second half of the year.What’s Next: As the crypto community navigates these turbulent times, upcoming events such as Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 19 will be crucial.Industry leaders will gather to discuss market trends, regulatory impacts, and future predictions, offering valuable insights into the evolving landscape of digital assets.Read Next: Crypto Adoption Is Coming ‘Slow And Steady,’ Research Report SaysThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

What Do the EU Election Results Mean for Digital Assets?

ECR, in particular, gained 15 seats last evening. 14 of those came from the party of the Italian Prime Minister, Georgia Meloni. She has been a much milder conservative than her election campaign might have suggested, recognizing the degree of cooperation needed with both Brussels and Washington DC in order to consolidate her power. Even so, formally working with the ECR might be a taboo for the mainstream parties. But collaboration on specific policy issues is now possible for the EPP, even if only used as a threat and a negotiation technique in disagreements with the center-left.

US Democratic Senators Sent a Letter to FED Chairman Jerome Powell! Called for Interest! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Three Democratic senators called on the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate, arguing that the current high interest rate is exacerbating inflation rather than curbing it.
Democratic Senators Urge Federal Reserve to Cut Interest Rate Due to Inflation Concerns
Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, which currently stands at 5.5%, the highest in two decades. He called for an immediate reduction in the federal funds rate.


“We write today to urge the Federal Reserve to lower the federal funds rate from a two-decade high of 5.5 percent.
“This prolonged period of high interest rates has already slowed the economy and failed to address the remaining key drivers of inflation,” senators wrote, according to a document on the HuffPost website.





The letter comes as financial markets, reacting to a surprisingly resilient labor market, have moved expectations for an interest rate cut to September, previously anticipated for July. This change in expectations stopped the rally in Bitcoin (BTC).

Senators argue that the high interest rate environment aimed at controlling inflation has contributed to increased housing, construction and auto insurance costs.


They warn that maintaining such high rates risks pushing the economy into recession and causing job losses for thousands of American workers. Analysts from JPMorgan noted that higher interest rates increase rental costs.
In their letter, the senators suggest that the Fed follow in the footsteps of the European Central Bank (ECB) and move away from its rigid 2% inflation target.





The ECB and the Bank of Canada recently cut interest rates, departing from the Fed's current stance of maintaining higher interest rates for longer.
The letter also highlights concerns that this divergence in policy could lead to a stronger dollar and tighter financial conditions, disrupting the flow of credit through various sectors of the economy and leading to an economic slowdown.

BRETT crypto hits new ATH, then dips - But wait, there's more! - AMBCrypto



BRETT dropped 7.55% from its ATH but sentiment around the token remained bullish.
Indicators revealed that the price might drop to $0.14 before a bounce appears.

On the 9th of June, Brett [BRETT], a memecoin developed on Base, the Coinbase  layer-2  rallied to a new All-Time High (ATH). As of the mentioned date, BRETT’s price was $0.19.
The price increase also ensured that the market cap got close to $2 billion before it fell. At press time, BRETT crypto changed hands at $0.16 with a market cap of $1.61 billion.
The token’s price was a 7.55% decrease in the last 24 hours. This decrease could be linked to profit-taking especially as the memecoin has produced an incredible 375% hike in the last 30 days.
Source: CoinMarketCap
Is the local top in?
Some developers launched the BRETT crypto in February 2024, and got the tag “PEPE’s best friend” on the Base Chain. With a growing community, the development was a response to the dominance of memecoin built on Solana [SOL].
As a result, the token became the most valuable cryptocurrency in terms of market cap on Base.
Despite the drop in price, the sentiment around the token remained bullish. Evidence of this reflected in AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data.
Provided by the on-chain analytic platform, Weighted Sentiment measures the comments online about a project. A positive reading suggests that a broader bullish perception.
On the other hand, a negative value of the metric indicates higher bearish sentiment on social platform. Another metric that AMBCrypto looked at was social dominance as this could influence the BRETT crypto price.
When the price hit its ATH, social dominance skyrocketed to 0.56. This implies that a surge in discussion around the cryptocurrency. For the price, this could be a sign of a local top.
Hence, it was not surprising that the memecoin retraced later. However, the social dominance also fell.
But the drop is not entirely a bad sign as the decrease in conversation could offer a buying opportunity before BRETT begins another rally.

BRETT may go lower before another rally
At the same time, it is possible for the token’s value to go lower. Therefore, $0.16 may not be the bottom.  However, let’s look at BRETT’s potential movement using indicators from the technical perspective.
According to the 4-hour chart, the 0.382 Fibonacci was at $0.12, indicating that this price was a nominal pull back. As such, if selling pressure increase, BRETT could plunge but might find support at this point.
Further, the 0.618 Fib positioned at $0.15 which could be a good entry should bulls defend BRETT crypto price. However, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) reading decreased.
With glaring red histogram bars, the AO showed that the token’s momentum was heading downwards. Reinforcing this position was the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) which also measures momentum.
As of this writing, the MACD reading was negative. The position of the Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) also supported a decline. At press time, the 12 EMA (blue) had crossed below the 26 EMA (orange).
Source: TradingView
This indicated that sellers had outpaced buyers. Assuming it was the other way around, the price action might have been in favor of buyers.

Realistic or not, heres’ BRETT’s market cap in PEPE terms

By the look of thing, BRETT’s price might drop to $0.14 or as low as $0.12. However, this bearish outlook could be invalidated if buying pressure resumes.
Should this be the case, the price could rise higher than $0.20.

																The weekend dump dragged Litecoin’s price below $80 as the cryptocurrency experienced significant sell pressure.
The accumulation over the past couple of weeks failed to drive the price higher, but the latest data suggest two potentially bullish indicators for the altcoin, predicting a recovery.
Litecoin’s Active Addresses Spike
According to the popular crypto analytic platform, Santiment, the number of addresses interacting on the Litecoin network more than doubled starting from June 4th. This increase in active addresses, from an average of around 345k in May to around 704k in the past week, suggests a significant uptick in network activity and adoption, which is generally considered a positive sign.
Santiment’s insights further indicate that Litecoin’s RSI has entered into the “opportunity zone” region, implying that the asset may be oversold and potentially primed for a price rebound. Combined, the surge in active addresses alongside the favorable RSI reading could potentially signify a rally for Litecoin in the near future.
Despite this, concerns about sell pressure still exist. Another related analysis showed that around 432,070 addresses acquired a total of 6.67 million LTC, purchasing with the price range of $81-$83. This significant buying activity indicates a strong interest at this price level.




If Litecoin manages to climb back to this range, it is likely that some of these investors may try to sell their holdings in an attempt to break even. In such a scenario, a potential selling pressure could create a resistance around the $81-$83 range.
Milestones for Litecoin
Litecoin briefly emerged as the most active blockchain in the world, surpassing Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of active addresses, suggesting a surge in usage due to cost and time efficiency last week.
On June 6th, IntoTheBlock data revealed that the number of active Litecoin addresses reached the highest level since January. The total number of Litecoin transactions hit 426k during this period of increased network activity.
While a majority of this transaction uptick involved smaller transactions under $10, there was also noticeable rise across transactions of all sizes on the network as indicated by the blockchain intelligence firm.

DeFi Technologies to stake $100 million in BTC on Core Chain

DeFi Technologies, a publicly listed Canadian fintech firm, is set to stake over $100 million worth of BTC on Core Chain. According to the company’s June 11 announcement, 1,498 BTC will be staked on the network. The company also revealed that it has set up a Core Chain validator node, which allows it to operate as an independent validator on the network.This announcement comes shortly after the firm adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, starting with a purchase of 110 BTC.Bitcoin stakingCore Chain, an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible Layer-1 blockchain powered by Bitcoin, offers BTC miners and stakers the opportunity to earn yield through its consensus mechanism, Satoshi Plus. This innovative system combines Delegated Proof of Work (DPoW) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).Network validators are crucial for transaction validation and block production in this framework. With the launch of its node, DeFi Technologies will process transactions and support the network’s consensus, boosting its performance. The company will also earn rewards for staking Bitcoin.Traditionally, staking rewards are exclusive to proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum and others. Bitcoin, which relies on a proof-of-work mechanism, does not natively support token staking. However, Core Chain’s unique approach enables non-custodial Bitcoin staking. This means any Bitcoin holder can earn yield by staking their tokens without relinquishing custody.Olivier Roussy Newton, CEO of DeFi Technologies, said the initiative was significant as it reflected the company’s commitment to the DeFi ecosystem and its partnership with the Core Foundation. He stated:“By staking 1,498 BTC and participating in network consensus, we are advancing our mission to bridge traditional finance with innovative blockchain technology, specifically leveraging Bitcoin’s potential.”According to Core Chain’s website, DeFi Technologies’ move will substantially increase the staked BTC on the network, which currently stands at 2,813 BTC.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

FTX debtors want to investigate balance sheet holes at FTX US


The FTX debtors in possession have filed a motion to authorize a second phase of investigation into issues surrounding the collapse of the US crypto exchange.
According to the filing, the investigation would be focused on three major issues, including the complete extent of legal firm Sullivan & Cromwell’s representation of Sam Bankman-Fried, potential claims against “former shareholders of Ledger Holdings” that “sold their interests prepetition” to FTX US, and the “frequency and magnitude of the holes” in the balance sheet at FTX US.
The investigations would apparently take roughly 10 weeks and cost approximately $3 million.

This second phase of the investigation would follow the earlier report, which contained allegations about FTX trying to pay off whistleblowers, using customer funds to fill ‘capital issues’ at their bank, and discussing how some executives seemed to be aware of problems well before the collapse.
This previous report also reiterated that the debtors found evidence of FTX US having insufficient assets at the time, with the former controller of FTX US even highlighting that it had included cash in its reconciliations that wasn’t meant to be included.
Former FTX chief exec Bankman-Fried regularly claimed before his conviction that FTX US was solvent, however, the continuing work of the debtors in possession looks to have turned up evidence that this claim, like many others, was never rooted in reality.
Objections to this motion are due by June 24, and the hearing to discuss it is scheduled for July 17.

ICBC's Analysis Highlights Bitcoin's Stability and Ethereum's Growth | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 6 June 2024, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) released an insightful research report titled “Macro Economy In-Depth Analysis: The Division and Integration of Digital Currency” that talked about the cryptocurrency space, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. The report was written by ICBC analysts Cheng Shi, Dorothy Zhou, and Andy Zhang.



ICBC is the largest banks in the world by total assets (approximately 6.3 trillion U.S. dollars as of the end of 2023, according to Statista). 







Founded in 1984 and headquartered in Beijing, ICBC is a state-owned commercial bank that offers a wide range of financial services. These services include retail and corporate banking, investment banking, asset management, insurance, and wealth management.



The bank has an extensive global network, with branches and subsidiaries in numerous countries, providing financial services to millions of personal and corporate clients worldwide. ICBC has built a strong reputation for its technological advancements and efficient customer service. It plays a crucial role in supporting China’s economic development through various financial products and services, including loans, credit cards, and international trade financing.



ICBC is known for its significant contributions to the Chinese economy, particularly in sectors such as infrastructure, manufacturing, and international trade. The bank’s ability to integrate innovative financial technologies and maintain robust risk management practices has helped it achieve a leading position in the global banking industry.



In their research report, ICBC’s analysts emphasize that Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market. ICBC highlights Bitcoin’s scarcity, similar to gold, achieved through mathematical limitations, making it a valuable digital asset. However, ICBC notes that Bitcoin’s current attributes as a currency are diminishing due to its volatility, difficulty to authenticate, and inconvenience in transactions. Despite these challenges, ICBC points out that Bitcoin’s asset characteristics are increasingly solidifying, ensuring its relevance as a store of value.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

ICBC says that Bitcoin’s role in the market is primarily driven by its established position as the first and most recognized cryptocurrency. ICBC underscores that its use as a speculative investment and a hedge against inflation contributes significantly to its demand. The report notes that Bitcoin’s market performance remains influenced by these factors, highlighting the ongoing need for clarity and stability in its regulatory environment.



ICBC gives considerable attention to Ethereum, describing it as the “digital oil” of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. ICBC states that unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum was designed as a versatile platform, enabling developers to build a wide array of decentralized applications (dApps) through its Turing-complete programming language, Solidity, and its virtual machine, EVM. ICBC emphasizes that this flexibility has allowed Ethereum to become a cornerstone in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).



ICBC explains that Ethereum’s ability to execute smart contracts securely, including both offensive and defensive code, significantly reduces vulnerabilities and enhances overall network security. ICBC states this attribute is crucial as it underpins the trust and reliability of the Ethereum network. 



ICBC notes that the complexity of smart contracts requires substantial computational resources, which can limit transaction processing capacity and increase costs. ICBC highlights that the Ethereum network continuously seeks to overcome these limitations by implementing various scaling solutions. ICBC points out that the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which introduced the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, is a significant step towards improving scalability and energy efficiency.



ICBC’s report reflects a strong commitment to sustainability in Ethereum’s evolution. ICBC states that the PoS mechanism reduces energy consumption compared to the traditional Proof of Work (PoW) model. ICBC notes that ongoing developments in Layer 2 solutions, such as state channels and side chains, aim to further enhance the network’s scalability while maintaining a balance between sustainability, security, and efficiency.

Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol reschedule token merger for July 15 - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The ASI Alliance, a new alliance formed by Fetch.ai, SingularityNET (SNET), and Ocean Protocol, has announced a new date for their anticipated token merger. The event, initially set for June 13, is now slated for July 15, according to a press release shared by the team.Earlier in March, Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol entered into a collaborative effort to establish an ethical and decentralized artificial intelligence ecosystem. As part of this initiative, their respective tokens, including FET, AGIX, and OCEAN, will be merged into a single token called the Artificial Superintelligence token (ASI).The merger’s preparation involves complex integrations and coordination with various third-party entities, essential for a smooth transition. The rescheduling is to ensure the seamless handling of technical and logistical requirements involving exchanges, validators, and ecosystem partners, according to the team.“While the finalization of the ASI token merger is now scheduled for July due to necessary adjustments by our partners, the commitment and vision driving this alliance remain stronger than ever,” stated Humayun Sheikh, CEO of Fetch.ai and chairman of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance.
“This temporary delay does not impact the substantial progress we have made towards creating a decentralized superintelligence network. Our teams are actively working with centralized exchanges to finalize the remaining steps. We appreciate the continued support and patience of our community and stakeholders as we work through these final logistical steps,” added he.As noted, FET, AGIX, and OCEAN continue trading independently on exchanges. Once technical integrations with third-party platforms are finalized, the ASI token will launch. At that point, FET, AGIX, and OCEAN will stop trading independently and merge into ASI.Additionally, token holders have been assured that no immediate action is required from their end, and the merger is expected to proceed without further delays, the team noted. More information about token contracts, migration procedures, and audits will be shared this week.Bruce Pon, founder and CEO of Ocean Protocol and board director in the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance Council, expressed gratitude for the community’s patience and anticipation for the unified ASI token.“We appreciate the patience of the community and look forward to a combined $ASI token that is supported by all partners, exchanges and token holders,” said Pon.

These AI Coins Could Explode As SingularityNET, Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol Start ASI Merger


This article was paid for*
AI coins are back in the spotlight as three major players in the sector are undergoing a landmark merger. 
The three-way merger between SingularityNET (AGIX), Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) and Fetch.ai (FET) will start today on June 11th and conclude on June 13th. 
As part of this agreement, the native tokens of the three firms will become one – under the umbrella of Fetch.ai – and will be renamed ASI, which stands for Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. 
Experts believe that the merger could spark a broader AI coins rally. New tokens such as WienerAI – an AI-powered meme coin – are also facing substantial demand, having already raised over $5.3 million in its ICO. 
ASI Merger Brings Spotlight To AI Coins
The crypto bull market so far has been dominated by meme coins. However, experts and retailers are not dismissing the upside potential of AI coins. 
For instance, a poll conducted by market intelligence platform Messari identified AI to be the biggest crypto trend of 2024, beating meme coins, RWA and DePIN. 

The ASI merger now has the potential to reignite interest in the sector, facilitating capital rotation from meme coins to AI cryptocurrencies. 
According to the project’s website, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is set to create the largest open-source, decentralized player in the field of AI research and development. It is a response to the Big Tech’s monopoly over AI development and monetization. 
The existing FET, AGIX and OCEAN tokens will eventually be burned in exchange for ASI. The FET tokens will converted to ASI at a 1:1 ratio. On the other hand, the ASI to OCEAN and ASI to AGIX ratios are set at 1:0.433226 and 1:0.433350, respectively. 
SingularityNET, Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol have been three of the top-performing AI coins during this bull run. FET, in particular, has rallied by over 800% over the past year, while AGIX and OCEAN are up by over 250% in the same period. 

The newly created ASI token is expected to capture the cumulative demand of the three individual cryptocurrencies. 
AI Coins That Could Explode Next
The new ASI token will unsurprisingly be in high demand, now that three erstwhile major players have joined forces. 
Investors are also eyeing the Worldcoin ($WLD) token as one that could explode next. During yesterday’s WWDC event, Apple announced a major partnership with OpenAI to roll out artificial intelligence systems in Mac and iOS devices. Notably, OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman is the founder of OpenAI as well. 
WLD is currently seeing selling pressure and is down over 6% in the daily time frame, largely due to the pre-FOMC derisking in the broader cryptocurrency market. However, if the upcoming CPI data and the Fed’s interest rate decision match the market’s expectations, WLD could display a significant bounce back. 
However, smart money traders are also eyeing new AI coins such as WienerAI as viable alternatives.
Is WienerAI The Best Crypto To Buy Now?
The new AI-powered meme coin WienerAI ($WAI) is in high demand, having already raised over $5 million in its ongoing ICO. 

With WAI in its presale, it remains unaffected by the short-term volatility in the broader market. On the other hand, experts believe that it could deliver outsized returns after its launch, especially once the top AI coins start to surge. 
A few smart-money traders are also hinting at the possibility of WienerAI offering 100x returns. 

VIDEO

WAI sits at the confluence of two of the most in-demand sectors, AI coins and meme tokens. Its memable mascot – a part sausage, part dog hybrid – has already caught the attention of meme coin enthusiasts. 
More importantly, the project is set to launch its own cutting-edge AI trading bot, portraying it as a canine companion for traders. The bot is set to offer seamless swaps, MEV protection and AI-enhanced predictive trading, all at zero additional fees. 
Furthermore, WienerAI has also launched its own staking protocol, which is currently offering an APY of over 200%. 
Interested buyers can head to the WienerAI presale and buy the meme coin using the over-the-counter widget. They are also advised to follow the project’s X and Telegram accounts for the latest updates.

ZKsync to Airdrop 3.6 Billion Tokens to Early Users - The Defiant

Contributors can claim their tokens starting June 24.The ZKsync Association is set to distribute 3.675 billion ZK tokens to its community members beginning next week.Announced on Tuesday, the airdrop, which makes up 17.5% of the total ZK token supply of 21 billion tokens, will run until Jan. 3, 2025. Contributors can claim their tokens starting June 24.Once claimed, ZK tokens can be used for governance within the ZKsync protocol, enabling token holders to vote on protocol upgrades and pay network fees.ZKsync is the third-largest zero-knowledge proof-based Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution, with over $750 million of assets in the network, according to L2Beat.Token AllocationAccording to a blog post by ZKsync, 49.1% of the entire token supply will be allocated to various ecosystem initiatives. Additionally, 17.2% of the tokens are reserved for investors, and 16.1% will go to Matter Labs, the company developing ZKsync. These team tokens will be locked for one year and will gradually unlock from June 2025 to June 2028."Awarding more tokens in the airdrop than to the Matter Labs team and investors is more than a symbolic decision for the community,” the press release stated. “When the ZKsync governance system launches in the coming weeks, the community will have the largest supply of liquid tokens to direct protocol governance upgrades.”Airdrop ExecutionA total of 695,232 wallets are eligible for the airdrop, based on activities recorded on ZKsync Era and ZKsync Lite as of March 24, 2024. The distribution will be divided between users (89%) and contributors (11%).ZKsync has capped the maximum allocation to any single address at 100,000 tokens.ZKsync employs a points system to determine token distribution. Points were awarded for activities like interacting with smart contracts, providing liquidity to DeFi protocols, and trading ERC-20 tokens.Activities on ZKsync Lite, such as donating to Gitcoin rounds, also earned points. Wallets with fewer than 450 ZK tokens will have their allocations recycled back into the pool to ensure a minimum of 917 ZK per wallet.In March, ZKsync’s total value locked (TVL) peaked at $930 million. However, the TVL has since decreased to $750 million, according to data from L2 beat.

Stocks to Watch Today: Apple, Gamestop, and First Solar - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), and First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR) experienced diverse market reactions on Tuesday as investors grappled with the implications of artificial intelligence advancements, meme stock resurgences, and analyst upgrades.



Apple Shares Surge to Record High on AI Announcements



At Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2024, the company unveiled a suite of new AI features, including enhancements to Siri, integration with ChatGPT, writing assistance tools, and customizable emojis. Despite an initial dip in premarket trading, Apple shares surged 5% to a record high of around $203 per share following the announcements. Analysts predict that these AI enhancements, available only on newer Apple devices and emphasizing privacy, will lead to a multi-year product refresh cycle and position Apple as a leader in consumer digital agents. 





GameStop Hoards Cash Amid Meme Stock Resurgence



GameStop, the iconic meme stock, has been leveraging its sudden popularity to raise capital and ensure financial stability amid a challenging business environment. The company raised $933 million by selling 45 million shares and plans to sell another 75 million shares potentially worth $1.9 billion. Despite its increased cash reserves, which now stand at $2 billion, GameStop has not yet made significant investments or acquisitions. The company’s stock price surged following renewed interest driven by social media influence, particularly by Roaring Kitty, but has since declined by half from its peak. GameStop’s operational focus has shifted towards cost-cutting rather than revenue growth, and it has closed several stores and warehouses.



First Solar Gains on Analyst Upgrade and Strong Financials



BMO Capital Markets increased First Solar’s price target from $224.00 to $311.00, maintaining an outperform rating on the stock. The company has also seen various upgrades from other analysts, with target prices ranging from $268.00 to $320.00. First Solar’s stock price was trading up 4.7% at $279.80 following the upgrade. The company reported strong financials, including a $2.20 earnings per share for the quarter, surpassing consensus estimates of $1.90. First Solar has a market cap of $29.95 billion, a P/E ratio of 29.33, and a 1-year high of $286.60.

Crypto Mixers, Privacy Coins, Layer 2s Complicate Tracing for Law-Enforcement Agencies, EU Innovation Hub for Internal Security Says

"Layer 2 solutions such as the Lightning Network might also be abused by criminals," the report said. "This can be used, for example, to make payments to each other without making times and amounts of these payments visible. Similarly, new wallet encryption schemes may also complicate lawful access by law enforcement."

FOMC and CPI Preview: Why the inflation reaction will be short-lived - Blockworks


Cryptocurrencies dipped Tuesday while US equities posted mixed returns midway through Tuesday’s session as investors awaited inflation data and an update from the Federal Reserve. 
Bitcoin and ether were each trading around 4% lower over 24 hours at time of publication, according to Coinbase. Bitcoin hovered around $66,900 after briefly breaching the $70,000 level Monday. 
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes were mostly flat, losing 0.2% and gaining 0.15%, respectively, at time of publication. 
Federal Open Market Committee members gathered Tuesday morning for the first day of their two-day policy setting meeting. Central bankers are expected to release their interest rate decision and projections Wednesday at 2 pm ET. Investors banking on a return in equities this week may be disappointed, analysts say.

“From 1994 to 2011, the S&P 500’s entire return came during FOMC meeting weeks,” Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note Tuesday. “This ‘Fed Drift’ has waned in the 2020s. Over the last 18 months, the S&P’s win-rate from Tuesday – Thursday of a Fed week is only 45%.” 
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics is also slated to release the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report Wednesday morning. Analysts from JPMorgan are calling for May’s month-over-month figure to show around a 0.3% increase in prices, which should have minimal impact on markets. 
UBS analysts are similarly expecting the yearly inflation figure to come in similar to the last read of 3.4% recorded in April, which should be enough to convince investors that prices are in fact trending lower. 
The CPI report is “still one of the most important monthly economic reports because the Fed can’t cut until there’s more progress on falling inflation; its impact will be lessened by the fact the Fed meeting is just a few hours later,” Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said. 
The market will digest CPI figures as it typically does, Essaye predicts, with a lower-than-expected inflation read sending prices higher and a higher inflation print sending prices lower. But, the report’s impact will be short-lived since the Fed will reveal their plans before markets close. 
“That said, it’s still an important medium-term indicator because regardless of the short-term influence tomorrow, the reality is the Fed can’t cut rates in earnest until core CPI is much closer to its 2% target, so any evidence that the decline has resumed will be positive, while still-sticky inflation will be a medium-term negative,” Essaye said.

ENS is not directly categorized as an NFT collection but uses NFT technology. ENS is a decentralized domain name protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to convert Ethereum addresses into human-readable formats.



This means that when you register an ENS domain, you receive a unique NFT that corresponds to your domain name, which can be transferred or sold just like any other NFT.



The second-ranking collection for the day was the $PIZZA BRC-20 NFTs, which recorded sales of US$2.18 million. 



This collection, residing on the Bitcoin blockchain, experienced a decrease in sales after topping the charts on Sunday with US$7.12 million. 



The third spot was claimed by Guild of Guardians Avatars, on the Immutable network, with sales totaling US$1.24 million.



Other notable collections on Monday’s leaderboard include the Blast’s Fantasy Top collection, which ranked fourth with sales of US$987,910, and the Genesis Fanta Field collection on Solana, which launched on Monday to debut in the top 10 with a total sales volume of US$635,539. 



The DMarket collection, on the Mythos network, joining other game-related NFTs in the day’s top 10 like Fantasy Top and Guild of Guardians, came in sixth with US$583,411.



The Bored Ape Yacht Club, Yuga Labs’ flag ship NFT ranked second in all-time sales, came in seventh for the day with US$470,907, while Polygon-based OKX NFT Creation collection followed closely in eighth place with sales of US$414,817. 



Two more Polygon collections, the Matr1x Fire Weapon, and TTAvatars rounded up the top 10 with around US$350,000 in sales each.



The Ethereum blockchain, led by ENS, led all blockchains in daily sales with US$8.45 million on Monday, up from US$4.51 million recorded the previous day. 



Bitcoin blockchain, saw a daily sales volume of US$4.11 million, dropping from the US$11.03 million reported on June 9.



Solana blockchain recorded sales of US$2.68 million, while the Polygon blockchain saw a higher volume of transactions with sales totaling US$2.44 million. 



Immutable reported sales of US$1.56 million, and the Blast blockchain had sales of US$988,646.

TipLink Aims for Crypto Newcomers With Google-Powered Solana (SOL) Wallet

That might irk the most committed of self-custody proponents, the ones for whom "not your keys, not your coins," rings loudest. But Krotinsky isn't worried about catering to that crowd. The app buries its private keys beyond easy reach to limit the possibility of users accidentally handing them to a would-be phisher, he said. Google's security protocols go a long way, especially for users who have two-factor authentication.

Despite the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granting approval for a spot Ethereum ETF, the cryptocurrency world is still awaiting S-1 approval to usher in trading of the asset. Per a source in communication with the SEC, some comments are now anticipated this week. Nate Geraci, an analyst, in a post on X said that at least one of the several prospective issuers that filed an application will receive comments from the regulatory authority this week. Spot ETH ETF regulatory delays and issuer expectationsNotably, since the May 31 deadline passed to submit the first draft of S-1 registrations, spot Ethereum ETF issuers have anticipated that the regulatory body would provide an update on the status of their application. To date, nothing definite has come from the Gary Gensler-led commission.Interestingly, issuers were optimistic that the SEC would provide comments on the drafts as of June 7. However, two of the issuers categorically stated that nothing was communicated from the SEC to them. The only communication from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler at a recent appearance on CNBC was ambiguous.The back and forth of the SEC prior to granting the 19b-4 approval led some issuers to drop out of the race. Notable among those that pulled out was Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest. The asset management firm, despite filing documents with the SEC in partnership with 21Shares to become an Ethereum ETF issuer, later withdrew.Ark Invest, in an official statement, noted that it continues to believe in Ethereum’s “transformative potential and long-term value.” However, Ark will no longer pursue an Ether ETF product.Stakeholders' concerns about spot Ethereum ETFAs issuers anticipate clear communication from the regulatory body, some stakeholders are entertaining doubt as to the potential of the spot Ethereum ETF product. Global banking firm JPMorgan believes that these products could attract a much lower share of inflows than expected.Analysts are, however, optimistic that if the SEC gives the green light, the product is likely to perform well in the crypto space.

The US crypto industry is bouncing back after rough regulatory year - Blockworks


What a difference a single year makes.
This time last year, the vibes were off. Crypto was in a funk — bear market aside — and it was one that stemmed from the larger regulatory picture. 
There’s no doubt that the market is more positive right now than it was a year ago, especially now that the bear market’s given way to a bullish environment.
While projects fled overseas last year, we’re beginning to see some projects move over to the US. A prime example being Circle, which plans to pursue an initial public offering on a US exchange. 
Of course, it would be naive to think this means that the regulatory speculation is over, especially after the Securities and Exchange Commission served Uniswap, Consensys and Robinhood with Wells notices. 
Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz noted on Empire this week that roughly 37% of the speakers for last year’s Permissionless conference dropped out because they didn’t want to risk being on US soil. 
Yanowitz noted that this year’s Permissionless — which takes place in the fall — hasn’t had that issue, which echoes what’s been seen at other conferences such as Consensus. 
But a question remains: How much damage has been done and where does crypto go from here?
Bill Hughes, chief legal officer at Consensys, said that it’s caused the crypto space to mature “more slowly than it would have otherwise.”
Read more from our opinion section: Hey regulators, here’s how to get crypto right
“It has stifled innovation from the little guy, who is more concerned with being targeted by the government due to having only modest means, giving larger incumbent crypto firms a competitive advantage, especially ones that are overseas. The anti-crypto types are the same ones who decry competition problems with Big Tech and undue foreign interests over sectors that are important to the US, yet they try to repeat history with their policy choices,” he continued.
Joshua Riezeman, GCR’s general deputy counsel, agreed that the current stance “hamstrung” the industry in the US. 
“The lack of clear, consistent and supportive regulations has created an atmosphere of uncertainty that stifles innovation and drives many crypto businesses that would otherwise much prefer a US base to more favorable jurisdictions abroad. Without a more constructive regulatory framework the US risks falling behind in this critical new industry,” Riezeman added.
On Empire, Avara CEO Stani Kulechov echoed the above, noting that the US lost “innovation” in the past couple of years.
Read more: SEC’s Hester Peirce gives advice to crypto industry as frustration with agency grows 
But Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski noted on the podcast that the crypto community in the US has managed to become a “powerful election force” despite the hurdles.
This is apparent in the recent bipartisan support for the FIT21 crypto bill, the pre-Biden veto rollback of the SEC’s SAB 121 rulemaking bulletin. But there’s also clearly partisan support, as former President Donald Trump adds crypto donations and allegedly claims he wants to be the “crypto president” (no proposed policies around crypto have been made public though).
Hughes seemingly agrees with Gluchowski, telling me that he’s still bullish on the US as a crypto hub.
“The US is still the best country to lead in this space, in terms of capital, talent and political philosophy. There’s good reason to believe the US will lead notwithstanding the efforts of loud, energetic detractors,” he added.
Kulechov said that DeFi is “just better financial infrastructure” given that the technologies are “valuable” for the users, and ensure that corporations have to play fair when it comes to interacting with the tech. Key note for Kulechov here is that it doesn’t take power from the government itself. 
Now, whether the US understands Kulechov’s point is a separate issue but with the way that crypto continues to innovate — from SocialFi to infrastructure builds — it’s clear that the technology itself addresses questions and concerns that folks have. Such as wanting a social media platform that doesn’t control the data, and instead handing that power to the user.
Hughes summed it up perfectly: “We need a regulatory environment here where the tech can live and die on its own merits around the use cases that the market demands.”
“But beneath it all, the industry just needs to keep building. Attract the best talent and pursue all the ideas worth trying. There will be a high failure rate in a new field such as this, but the ideas that change the world will rise to the surface,” he added.

Europol Drops Bitcoin Bomb: Mining Hotbed For Criminal Activity


								In a recent report, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) has expressed grave concerns about the potential misuse of crypto mining and layer-2 blockchain solutions by criminal elements. The agency warns that these technologies could pose significant challenges for law enforcement investigations, potentially hindering their ability to trace illicit funds and recover stolen assets.

Crypto Mining: A Lucrative Laundering Scheme?
Europol’s report highlights the growing trend of criminals using crypto mining operations to obscure the origins of their ill-gotten gains. By integrating illicit proceeds into mining activities, criminals can effectively launder their money and even generate additional profits in the process.
The agency has detected suspicious activity in mining pools, particularly those exploited by ransomware operators, who use these platforms to further their criminal enterprises.

“Pool mining schemes have also been used by scammers to run their Ponzi schemes,” the report states. “For example, the BitClub Network promised earnings through pool mining, while these pools did not actually exist; defrauded investors lost hundreds of millions of euros.”

Layer-2 Solutions: A Double-Edged Sword
While layer-2 blockchain solutions have been touted as a means to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs, Europol sees them as a potential threat to law enforcement efforts. The agency warns that the increasing use of zero-knowledge proofs and other layer-2 applications could make it significantly harder to trace the flow of funds on the blockchain.”
These technologies might cause additional problems for law enforcement investigations,” the report states, without elaborating on the specific challenges these solutions might introduce.
Europol Report: The SLIP39 Conundrum
Europol also highlights the potential complications posed by the SLIP39 standard, commonly known as Shamir Backup, which is used by many hardware crypto wallets. This standard allows for the creation of multiple recovery shares instead of a single mnemonic phrase, with each share consisting of 20 words.
BTC is now trading at $66,826. Chart: TradingView
A user-defined number of these shares are required to restore a wallet, adding an extra layer of complexity for law enforcement agencies seeking to recover a criminal’s assets. “The task of recovering a criminal’s wallet could be complicated significantly due to the SLIP39 standard,” the report states.
Is Crypto Mining Criminal In Nature?
While Europol’s concerns are valid, it is important to note that crypto mining and layer-2 solutions are not inherently criminal in nature. These technologies have numerous legitimate applications and have the potential to revolutionize the financial industry. However, as with any powerful tool, there is always the risk of misuse by bad actors.
To address these challenges, Europol calls for increased collaboration between law enforcement agencies, regulators, and the crypto industry. By working together to develop robust anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures, while also fostering innovation in the crypto space, it may be possible to strike a balance between security and progress.

The report was produced by the following EU Innovation Hub for Internal Security members: Europol, Eurojust, European Commission’s Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs (DG HOME), European Commission’s Joint Research Center (JRC), European Council’s Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, and the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (EU-LISA).

zkSync airdrop under fire for Sybil attacks and ineligibility cases - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The long-awaited layer-2 blockchain zkSync airdrop checker was revealed today, with 17.5% of the token supply destined for 695,000 wallets. Despite the significant supply allocation, nearly 90% of all addresses that interacted with the blockchain got out of the reward distribution, sparking backlash from part of the crypto community on how Matter Labs fought against Sybil users.The first controversy around the airdrop relates to the reward cap, which was 100,000 tokens. As highlighted by the user who identifies himself as Olimpio on X, 155 wallets surpassed this limit. Mudit Gupta, Chief Information Security Officer at Polygon Labs, said that the zkSync airdrop was probably the “most farmable and farmed airdrop ever,” as it presented “no Sybil filtering” and anyone aware of the eligibility criteria could farm it easily.Sybil is the term used to address users who fake interactions and use multiple wallets to become eligible. Since airdrops are a way to reward early adopters who engage with an ecosystem, they are considered harmful to those campaigns.Adam Cochran, a partner at Synthetix, also stated the zkSync airdrop was not “a well-planned airdrop from a Sybil perspective.
“Those criteria are easy to not hit as a real user, and easy to hit as a farmer, and had no anti-sybil program. Real users could easily use 1-2 dapps or only a handful of tokens on your chain when it’s so new and has so few projects. Projects really need to put more thought into this stuff if they don’t want turbo dumping mercenaries,” said Cochran.
The user identified as “Artemis the Sybil Hunter” shared that Sybil accounts are bagging over 2 million ZK tokens by depositing identical Ethereum (ETH) amounts on the same day, resulting in 15,000 tokens airdropped to each wallet. What’s more, nearly all of them are flagged on the LayerZero Labs Sybil list,” he added. Further research suggests that the token volume allocated to Sybil users could be over 12.7 million.https://twitter.com/artemis_rsch/status/1800463892352782345Additionally, artificial intelligence-focused research firm Kaito AI measured the crypto community sentiment on X through their upcoming feature, finding out that users are not happy about Sybil attacks concerns, ineligibility related to those attacks, and a disparity in rewards.

Tax Solution for Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) Launches


Ledgible, a crypto tax and accounting platform, announced the launch of its tax reporting solution for tokenized real-world assets (RWA). 
This development comes as federal regulations tighten around digital assets. These include mandates like IRS Form 1099-DA, which require detailed reporting on digital asset activities.

Ledgible Unveils Tax Reporting for RWA
Ledgible’s platform aims to help enterprises and institutions navigate complex regulatory requirements. In a statement, Kell Canty, the firm’s CEO, emphasized the platform’s readiness to ensure compliance. 

“As federal regulations around digital assets, like IRS Form 1099-DA, mandate companies begin reporting out on their digital asset activities including tokenized real world assets, the Ledgible platform is uniquely positioned to ensure compliance,” Canty said.

Given the crypto industry’s trajectory towards tokenized real-world assets, the launch is timely. 
Notably, Franklin Templeton, one of the world’s largest investment managers, recently launched the first US-registered fund to use a public blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership. The firm partnered with Ledgible, reflecting the necessity for tax reporting solutions.


“This is an exciting step in our continued journey to make the digital assets ecosystem more accessible to both traditional and blockchain-native investors. We are also building the framework for BENJI tokens to be interoperable with additional tokens in the not-too-distant future,” Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton, said.

NOT, WIF face sharp sell-offs: A look at key market indicators - AMBCrypto



The prices of NOT and WIF have declined in the last week.
This has been due to a surge in profit-taking activity.

Notcoin [NOT] and dogwifhat [WIF] have shed their most recent gains. The two altcoins have witnessed double-digit price declines in the past seven days. 
According to CoinMarketCap, NOT’s value dropped by 35%, while WIF’s price dipped by 21%. At press time, NOT exchanged hands at $0.016, and the memecoin WIF traded at $2.62.
NOT braces for more dip
Following its launch on the Toncoin network on 16th May, NOT’s value climbed to a peak of $0.02 on 2nd June. 
However, as profit-taking activity gained momentum, NOT bulls could not defend that price level, hence the price decline. At its current value, the altcoin’s price has dropped by 20% from its high.
An assessment of key momentum indicators confirmed the surge in NOT sell-offs in the past few days. 
For example, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) trended toward their respective center lines. At press time, the token’s RSI and MFI were 55.31 and 56.56, confirming the decline in buying pressure. 
Further, the value of NOT’s Aroon Up Line (orange) was 35% at the time of writing. This indicator identifies the strength of an asset’s price trends and potential reversal points.
When an asset’s Aroon Up line is close to zero, the uptrend is weak, and the most recent high was reached a long time ago. 
At its current price, NOT traded close to its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), which tracks the token’s average price in the past 20 days. 
When an asset trades close to this key moving average, it signals a decline in buying momentum and an indication that the bears might soon regain market control.
Source: TradingView
WIF sellers take charge 
Regarding WIF, its performance has not been any different, as the bearish bias toward the leading meme coin remains significant. 
For example, its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) rested below the zero line to return a value of -0.09 at press time. 
This indicator measures the flow of money into and out of the WIF market. When its value is negative, it signals liquidity outflow from the market, which is a bearish sign and a precursor to a further price decline.

Realistic or not, here’s NOT’s market cap in SOL terms

Also, readings from WIF’s Directional Movement Index (DMI) showed its positive directional index (green) resting below its negative index (red). 
Source: TradingView
This means that bear strength is more significant than bull strength. It is interpreted as a signal that the sellers have market control.

Everything You Need to Know About Raspberry Pi's (RPI) IPO - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Half into 2024, the US stock market saw 81 initial public offerings (IPOs). If the trend continues, it will align with the 154 IPOs in 2023, far from the all-time record-breaking year of 2021 with 1,035 IPOs.



In the UK’s London Stock Exchange (LSE), these investing vehicles are rare given the economy’s contraction and stagnation. Three of the six IPOs launched in 2024 on the alternative investment market (AIM). However, Raspberry Pi Holdings PLC (LSE: RPI) is one of the main launches in the market.



Having started trading on Tuesday on LSE, Raspberry Pi stock opened at 360 GBX (Pence Sterling), now trading at 385.60 GBX, which translates to $4.91 per RPI share. At press time, the highest RPI price level was 390 GBX. 



However, this is only reserved for select investors via conditional trading. The retail trading of Raspberry Pi stock starts on June 14th (Friday). Here is what investors should know about Raspberry Pi’s entry into the stock market.



Raspberry’s Fusion of Charity with Capital Goals



The initial pricing of Raspberry Pi IPO shares puts the company’s valuation at around £541.6 million ($688.8 million). Based in Cambridge, Raspberry Pi’s leadership hopes to expand operations to build more products to “make computing accessible and affordable for everybody.”



In other words, the company outgrew its charity origins to become more effective. The CEO, Eben Upton, founded the Raspberry Pi Foundation in 2009, coming out of the University of Cambridge’s Computer Laboratory. Ever since the foundation has been building compact and cheap single-board computers.



The first model was priced at around $30, while the latest-gen Raspberry Pi 5 has all the modern computing features. Its price starts at around $64, depending on the wide range of configurations centered around Arm’s chip architecture.



In 2012, the foundation launched its incorporated subsidiary Raspberry Pi Ltd to scale up the marketing and distribution of its computers. Outlined in foundation’s 2025 strategy, Raspberry Pi’s long-term goals revolve around advancing non-formal learning, education and research. 



The goals center the younger demographic (5-25) interfacing with computing at the lowest cost possible. The commercial aspect of Raspberry Pi, now enhanced with a publicly traded company, follows the previous path of donated profits from Raspberry Pi Ltd sales. 





What Kind of Raspberry Pi Sales Volumes Can Investors Expect?



In this dynamic between regular philanthropic donations, government (education) contracts, and Raspberry Pi Ltd sales, the latter accounted for $66 million in gross profit during 2023, from the total revenue of $266 million across 60 million devices sold.



The nature of Raspberry Pi products positions the company within the embedded category, making 72% of its sales in fiscal year 2023. Most of the revenue comes from Europe (38%), but it is relatively evenly distributed across North America (29%) and Asia (26%).  This points to the foundation’s successful alignment with its global education goals.



According to Fortune Business Insights, the embedded systems market will grow at a CAGR of 7.1% from 2023 to 2030, from $100.04 billion to $161.86 billion.



As previously noted, the company relies on a strategic partnership with Arm Holdings (ARM), a British semiconductor architecture designer found in most mobile devices. In April 2023, Raspberry Pi Ltd. received a strategic investment from its other partnership, Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation (“SSS”).




“Our goal is to provide new value to a variety of industries and support them in solving issues using our innovative edge AI sensing technology built around image sensors,”

Owing to its open and modular design philosophy, Raspberry Pi already offers the Hailo-8L accelerator module for the aforementioned Raspberry Pi 5. The platform is also AI-ready for machine learning and computer vision within its Raspberry Pi AI Kit. 



Given the popularity of AI and the need to learn its workings to stay competitive, Raspberry Pi’s stock is likely to gain $5 per share once retail trading is enabled on Friday. For now, the US stock market launch is not on the table.

Cardano About To Witness ‘Most Significant Milestone’ As It Gears Up for Chang Hard Fork: Charles Hoskinson - The Daily Hodl


								Cardano (ADA) co-founder Charles Hoskinson is outlining the timeline for the layer-1 blockchain’s Voltaire phase, the fifth stage of the 11th-largest crypto asset’s roadmap.
Hoskinson says that a new Cardano node which will usher in two Chang upgrades is ready for deployment.










The first Chang upgrade will introduce governance features on Cardano, enabling decentralized voting and various other governance processes. Chang Upgrade 2 is expected to unlock more on-chain governance features such as treasury withdrawals and delegated representative participation.
Says Hoskinson,
“It looks like June will be the month that Cardano Node will reach 9.0. This means that Cardano is Chang fork-ready and waiting for 70% of the Stake Pool Operators to install the new node. Then, a hard fork can occur pushing Cardano into the Age of Voltaire. 
It’s the most significant milestone in the history of Cardano and for the industry as a whole. Cardano will be a decentralized civilization spanning the entire world with millions of residents. We’ll have the most advanced blockchain governance system, annual budgets, a treasury, and the wisdom of our entire community to guide us.”
The Voltaire phase is the final stage of Cardano’s roadmap, which is designed to make the blockchain a self-sufficient network.
“When both a voting and treasury system are in place, Cardano will be truly decentralized and no longer under IOHK’s (Input Output Hong Kong’s) management. Instead, Cardano’s future will be in the hands of the community, who will have everything they need to grow and evolve Cardano from the secure, decentralized basis established by IOHK.”

Polygon unveils 1 billion POL token program to boost developer engagement

Polygon, the Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, has unveiled a Community Treasury initiative funded with 1 billion POL tokens, which will be distributed over the next decade to drive developer engagement on the network.According to the June 11 press release, the tokens will be sourced from 1% of the network’s annual token emissions, as detailed in the POL whitepaper.Polygon grantPolygon has launched the first season of its Community Grant Program (CGP), offering developers an initial 35 million MATIC valued at around $22 million. Future seasons will provide up to 100 million POL tokens as the network transitions from MATIC to POL.Polygon’s CGP aims to support early-stage builders with essential funding. Polygon stated:“Building is hard. The goal of CGP is to support developers while they build. Waiting until a project has finished building and produces results misses a key piece of true innovation: the opportunity to take chances.”Developers can apply for grants from June 11 to Aug. 31. The grants range from 5,000 MATIC to over 50,000 MATIC. The Community Treasury Board will oversee the selection process.Applications are open for the General Grants Track and the Consumer Crypto Track. The General Grants Track includes all projects building on the Polygon protocol, such as protocol infrastructure and developer tooling libraries.On the other hand, the Consumer Crypto Track targets projects focused on driving consumer adoption, including gaming, decentralized social platforms, content creation, and NFT innovations.Crypto community members have welcomed the initiative, pointing out that it would motivate builders to develop innovative projects.Game developer Chris Heatherly said:“Watch as Polygon goes from ‘dead’ to the hottest chain going because they now have rewards.”Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Will Trump Trounce Biden? Polymarket Traders Are Betting on It.

On the other hand, these traders are betting on what will happen, not what they want to happen. So they are highly incentivized to research and make informed decisions, regardless of their political preferences. In theory, at least, these markets should be a more reliable gauge of sentiment than polling, and perhaps a superior forecasting method as well.

What's Going On With Coinbase's Stock? - Coinbase Glb (NASDAQ:COIN) - Benzinga

Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN shares are trading lower Tuesday amid a dip in the price of Bitcoin BTC/USD. What To Know:Bitcoin is trading down by more than 3% over the past 24 hours at $67,171.52, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD announced the acquisition of Bitstamp Ltd., an established, global cryptocurrency exchange, last week. Robinhood's further expansion into cryptocurrency is putting some pressure on established crypto exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, as a new competitor enters the market. Last week, Coinbase introduced its new smart wallet as a solution to the previously cumbersome onboarding process associated with crypto wallets. "These next-generation wallets address the biggest pain points of the crypto experience today," the company stated, in a blog post. "Smart wallets make the transition to onchain smoother than ever."Related News: Yext Stock Falls On Q1 Results, Acquisition Of Hearsay Systems: The DetailsIs COIN A Good Stock To Buy? An investor can make a few decisions when deciding whether a stock is a good buy. In addition to valuation metrics and price action which you can find on Benzinga's quote pages  – like Coinbase Glb‘s page for example – there are factors like whether or not a company pays a dividend or buys a large portion of its stock each quarter.These are known as capital allocation programs. Coinbase Glb COIN does pay a dividend, which yields 0.43% per year as of the closing price on Jun. 11, 2024. Feel free to search Benzinga's dividend calendar for the next company that is due to pay a dividend and determine what kind of yield you can earn for holding a share of the company.For example, if you're looking to earn an annualized return of 13.81%, you'll need to buy a share of Ellington Residential by the Jun. 28, 2024. Once done, you can expect to receive a nominal payout of $0.08 on Jul. 25, 2024.Buyback programs are obviously different and highly variable. A company can approve a buyback program and purchase shares as it sees fit over the course of time in which the buyback was authorized. Looking through the latest news on Coinbase Glb will often yield whether or not the company has approved a buyback program recently. Buyback programs usually serve as a support for share prices, serving as a backstop for demand.COIN Price Action: According to Benzinga Pro, Coinbase shares are down 4.83% at $237.75 at the time of publication Tuesday.Image: Benjamin Nelan from Pixabay

XRP Attracts $1.2 Million Inflow, 40 Trillion SHIB in Spotlight As Bulls and Bears Clash, Cardano Dominating Social Media Discussions: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


U.Today has prepared the top three news stories over the past day.XRP attracts $1.2 million inflow amid altcoin market doldrumsAs recently reported by CoinShares, in the past week, XRP attracted inflows of $1.2 million. This surge is a stark contrast to the subdued activity seen on the broader altcoin market. In comparison to XRP, other altcoins cannot boast such major inflows; Solana, Litecoin and Chainlink experienced inflows of $0.7 million, while Binance received only $0.2 million. Notably, XRP is displaying a weekly trend of growing inflows; the week prior to last, XRP received $0.8 million, up from $0.4 million the week earlier. There could be a number of reasons behind the influx of XRP, including a change in investor interest, but the exact cause for this remains unknown. At the moment of writing, XRP is trading at $0.4819, down 4.17% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap data.40 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) in spotlight as bulls and bears clashBased on Shiba Inu's current price action, the dog-themed meme coin might be approaching a crucial support level of 40 trillion SHIB tokens. Per IntoTheBlock's data, 51,350 addresses are holding 40.08 trillion SHIB in the range between $0.000019 and $0.000023, which is extremely close to the current market price of $0.0000232. The 40 trillion token range has emerged as a critical support for Shiba Inu; if this support holds, it could serve as a foundation for a potential price rebound. On the other hand, should the support fail, SHIB could face further downward pressure, potentially to $0.000014. A high-stakes battle between bulls and bears has put the 40 trillion SHIB support level at the forefront right now, as each is trying to push the price in their favor. The outcome of this battle may determine the short-term price trajectory of SHIB. However, it remains to be seen who will be the winner.Cardano (ADA) dominating social media discussionsData provided by Santiment shows that Cardano is leading the race in terms of social media engagement. Such a boost in activity among social media users is caused by the recent announcement from Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson; as previously reported by U.Today, Hoskinson shared in his X post on June 9 that the network was on the verge of the Chang hard fork. According to the founder, the hard fork is expected to be the most important development for Cardano as well as the industry as a whole. Hoskinson's optimism sparked vivid discussions on social media, with many users supporting his bullish view. However, this buzz has not resulted in any significant advancement for ADA's price. At the moment of writing, ADA is changing hands at $0.419, down 6.42% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.

Ripple's Strategic Moves Could Boost XRP Value, Analyst Says


							

Ripple’s Asia Pacific expansion bolsters XRP’s utility and adoption, setting up long-term growth pending regulatory clarity.



XRP’s integration in healthcare aims to streamline payments, boosting efficiency and market reach, driving demand.



Despite bearish signals, technical indicators show potential entry points; strategic initiatives underpin long-term optimism.




XRP’s current price struggles and potential factors influencing its future trajectory was put to discussion over a recently uploaded Youtube video.



The analyst expressed optimism about XRP’s future, citing Ripple’s expansion in the Asia Pacific region for cross-border payments and its integration into the healthcare sector. These developments could increase XRP’s demand and price once regulatory uncertainty is resolved.



Ripple’s ongoing initiatives in the Asia Pacific region aim to streamline cross-border payments. This expansion is viewed as crucial for increasing XRP’s utility and adoption. Furthermore, Ripple’s strategic moves in this region could provide XRP with a solid foundation for long-term growth. If regulatory concerns surrounding cryptocurrencies ease, demand for XRP may rise significantly.



The integration of Ripple into the healthcare industry is another promising development. By utilizing XRP for healthcare transactions, Ripple aims to streamline payment processes, potentially boosting efficiency and reducing costs. This integration could expand XRP’s market reach and strengthen its position.









The analyst also highlighted several technical indicators suggesting XRP’s current price challenges. Bearish signals are prevalent, indicating potential difficulties in the short term. However, opportunities for dollar-cost averaging and relief rallies exist, providing potential entry points for investors. Key resistance levels, including $0.5715 and various Fibonacci levels, could serve as benchmarks for future price movements.



Despite the ongoing legal disputes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, XRP’s long-term outlook remains positive. Ripple’s strategic initiatives in the healthcare and Asia Pacific sectors are expected to significantly impact future demand. These steps could mitigate the effects of the ongoing price struggles and position XRP for substantial growth if regulatory constraints are lifted.

Warning from the EU for Bitcoin (BTC) and These Altcoins! - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to Decrypt, the latest report published by the EU Homeland Security Innovation Center wrote that the Bitcoin Lightning Network and other second-layer solutions could be used as potential tools in criminal activities.
The EU report Mimblewimble made comparisons with other encryption technologies, such as token mixers and privacy-focused cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Zcash, noting that these technologies, apart from the Bitcoin Lightning Network, can also be used by criminals to hide data.


The report also targeted cryptocurrency mixers like Tornado Cash and privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero, Zcash, Grin and Dash.
The report also touched on Mimblewimble, the cryptographic protocol used by cryptocurrencies such as Grin, Beam, and Litecoin (LTC).






“ Cryptocurrency mixers such as the Bitcoin Lightning Network, Tornado Cash, and privacy-focused cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Zcash can be misused as potential tools in criminal activities.
Apart from these, Mimblewimble, a cryptographic protocol adopted by digital currencies such as Grin, Beam and Litecoin, is also defined as a significant obstacle in monitoring cryptocurrency transactions.
“In this regard, the EU is concerned that these technologies create difficulties for law enforcement by hiding transaction data.”

While the EU report emphasizes the need for regulatory measures to reduce the risks associated with privacy-oriented cryptocurrency technologies, it points out that these regulations may have a deterrent feature for criminals.

Dormant Bitcoin whale awakes, turns $30M into $535M in 5 years


    A 5.5-year dormant Bitcoin (BTC) whale became active on June 11, moving 8,000 BTC to a Binance address. This Bitcoin investor would realize over $500 million in profits if selling these coins at current prices.



Notably, the Bitcoin wallet address ‘1FMbcnYvvccZ6hR324cFRpn1QX9TCkqtAe‘ acquired the 8,000 BTC at a dollar-cost average of $3,810, Lookonchain reported. This would result in a theoretical $30 million investment that the page says occurred on December 6, 2018.



As developed, the dormant Bitcoin whale woke up after 5.5 years and sent the whole balance to Binance. Usually, sending cryptocurrencies to an exchange shows an intention to sell or, in this case, to realize a 5-year profit.







At the prices by the time of Lookonchain‘s post on X, the 8,000 BTC stack was worth $535 million.







Dormant Bitcoin whale acquisition history



Finbold went one step further and looked into the acquisition history of this dormant Bitcoin whale, crossing it with price.



In particular, ‘1FMbcnYvvccZ6hR324cFRpn1QX9TCkqtAe’ first received 6,800 BTC on November 28, 2018, at $3,754 per coin. The whale added 1,000 BTC on December 5 at $3,487 and 200 BTC on March 13, 2019.



1FMbcnYvvccZ6hR324cFRpn1QX9TCkqtAe balance history. Source: Santiment



Moving all the coins now signals a bearish bias from this particular whale, which could affect overall market perception.



Analysts have spotted high volatility signals for this week, ahead of the FOMC meeting and interest rate decision, while Bitcoin’s low network activity measured by on-chain transactions volume and spot trading volume has also suggested a lack of interest in BTC besides the speculative demand through derivatives like futures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



Interestingly, the network saw all-time high fees of $195 per transaction due to UTXO consolidation operations from OKX this weekend. This has raised concerns about the network’s accessibility while macroeconomics imposes a challenge for risk assets, including for the cryptocurrency, stock, and finance markets.



In closing, Bitcoin trades at $66,300 by press time, close to its all-time high of $73,805 and 20 times higher than when the dormant whale acquired its 8,000 BTC.

May Inflation Report Clashes With Fed Meeting: Traders Brace For Volatile Wednesday - SPDR Gold Trust (ARCA:GLD) - Benzinga

For the first time since June 2020, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will be released on the same day as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.This sets up a potentially volatile Wednesday for financial markets.Following three consecutive months of higher-than-expected inflation readings in the first quarter of 2024, April's data showed an easing in price pressures, aligning with forecasts. The new CPI data will thus be crucial in determining if inflationary pressures are continuing to decline, which could support hopes of reaching the Federal Reserve's 2% target.This heightens the significance of the May inflation report, due from the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday.The outcome of the May inflation report will also heavily influence Fed Chair Jerome Powell's stance during his press conference on the same day.A softer inflation reading could bolster the case for interest rate cuts down the road this year, while a higher-than-expected number might necessitate a more aggressive approach, probably reiterating the need to keep rates high for longer. Market participants currently estimate a 50-50 chance of a rate cut in September, with expectations of only one fully priced rate cut by year-end.Read Also: Fed Meeting Preview: Economists Predict Steady Rates In June, Fewer Cuts AheadMay Inflation Report Preview: What Do Economists Expect?
The consensus among economists, as compiled by Econoday, forecasts that the headline annual inflation rate will hold steady at 3.4%. 



On a monthly basis, the overall CPI is expected to advance by 0.1%, down from April’s 0.3% rise.



The core annual inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is projected to remain at 3.6%, , with a monthly advance of 0.3%, unchanged from April. 
Goldman Sachs economist Manuel Abecasis expects a slower pace of inflation in sectors such as consumer electronics and personal care, which should reflect in the May data. He also predicts a continued rise in car insurance prices, albeit at a slower pace, and stable rent and Owner’s Equivalent Rent (OER) inflation rates.“Going forward, we expect monthly core CPI inflation to remain in the 0.2-0.3% range for the next few months before settling around 0.2% by end-2024. We forecast year-over-year core CPI inflation of 3.5% and core PCE inflation of 2.8% in December 2024,” Abecasis stated.Prominent veteran market analyst Ed Yardeni believes the May CPI report will confirm ongoing moderation in inflation. “The Cleveland Fed's Inflation Nowcasting model shows headline and core CPI rose 3.36% and 3.55% year-over-year in May, which would be the lowest annual core inflation reading since April 2021,” he noted. Yardeni also expects a decline in shelter inflation and used car prices, with hopes that other auto-related consumer prices will stabilize.Bank of America’s economist Michael Gapen sees the May report continuing the positive trend from April. “After averaging 0.4% month-over-month from January through March, inflation took a step in the right direction in April. We expect core and headline CPI at 0.3% and 0.1% month-over-month for May, respectively, keeping annual rates unchanged from April at 3.6% and 3.4%,” Gapen commented.Prior Market Reactions To The CPI ReportThe release of April's CPI report on May 15, 2024, triggered rallies across stocks, bonds, gold, and speculative assets.
The S&P 500, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, rose by 1.2% on that day. 



The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, monitored through the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ, rallied 1.6%. 



Long-dated bond yield fell, pushing the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF TLT up by 1.4%. 



Gold, tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust GLD, rose 1.3%. 



Bitcoin BTC/USD skyrocketed 7.4%, marking its strongest day in two months, the third strongest year to date. 



A measure of the dollar, as gauged by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF UUP, fell 0.7%, recording its worst 1-day performance since mid-December 2023.

Ethereum Whale Activity On The Rise Following Spot ETH ETF Approval ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Ethereum (ETH) has been exhibiting signs of weakness, continuing its descent below the $4,000 mark this week. The daily price chart reveals a downward trend, with the cryptocurrency declining by approximately 5.89% over the past seven days. This decline can be attributed to several factors, including a broader market pullback led by Bitcoin.



Nevertheless, amidst this price drop, Ethereum whale activity has surged significantly following the approval of the spot ETH ETF last month. Over the weekend, Ali Martinez, a popular crypto analyst, highlighted this development, noting that Ethereum addresses holding 10,000 or more ETH have increased by 3% in the last three weeks, indicating a significant spike in buying pressure.







Technical analysts also believe ETH is poised for a potential surge. Notably, the cryptocurrency recently broke through its consolidation pattern resistance, spurred by the ETF approval news on May 20th. However, the initial market reaction seemed premature and fueled by rumors, leading to a subsequent consolidation phase.



In a post on TradingView, analyst RLinda noted that ETH is currently forming a consolidation pattern with the potential for an upward breakout.



“The candlestick patterns on W1, D1, and H4 form interesting bullish premises indicating that it is the buyer who is assembling a position with the aim of breaking the $3,830-$3,950 resistance with the aim of rallying and updating ATH.” She wrote.

&nbsp







However, some analysts urge caution. Analyst “Greatest Trader” from CryptoQuant warned that Ethereum’s decline might persist in the short term if market conditions do not improve. Despite ETH’s struggle to surpass the $4,000 mark, he noted that attention is now on the futures market participants’ behavior. He presented a chart showing that the 7-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, which measures the relative aggressiveness of buyers versus sellers, has declined sharply and has not risen above one.



“This trend suggests that the majority of futures traders have been selling Ethereum aggressively, either for speculative purposes or to realize profits. This significant drop in the metric is a bearish signal, suggesting that the current downward retracement could persist if this trend continues.” He stated.







ETH was trading at $3,473 at press time, reflecting a 4.95% drop over the past 24 hours. Notably, the coin’s price experienced a flash crash earlier on Tuesday, partially attributed to a whale dumping roughly 150,000 ETH worth $1.1 billion on Coinbase.

European law authorities raise concerns over privacy coins, Layer-2 networks and crypto mixers

The EU Innovation Hub for Internal Security has released its first comprehensive report on encryption, focusing significantly on crypto-related issues.The report, a collaboration between Europol, Eurojust, and other EU agencies, delves into how cryptocurrencies are impacting law enforcement efforts.It highlights the significant gaps in law enforcement’s ability to track and recover illicit digital assets moved via decentralized methods like privacy coins, layer-2 networks, and crypto mixers.Crypto and Law EnforcementAccording to the report, cryptocurrencies, which rely heavily on public-private key cryptography, pose unique challenges and opportunities for law enforcement.The report outlines how cryptocurrencies are increasingly used for laundering criminal proceeds, complicating efforts to trace illicit funds. The rise of technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and Layer-2 (L2) networks, which enhance privacy, may further obscure the origins and movements of these funds.The report said that currently, law enforcement can only recover funds moved via custodial wallets — where users do not hold their own private keys — by cooperating with exchanges and service providers to seize crypto suspected of criminal activity.This cooperation is crucial, given the stringent user identification measures (know-your-customer, or KYC) mandated by anti-money laundering regulations. However, illicit funds moved via decentralized wallets and addresses remain beyond the reach of law enforcement due to the enhanced privacy offered by these technologies.Technological Advancements and Data ObfuscationThe report highlighted several advancements that complicate tracking crypto transactions. Privacy coins like Monero obscure transaction details, presenting significant tracing challenges despite being less popular than Bitcoin among criminals.Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies such as Dash and Litecoin offer optional encryption features that enhance transaction obfuscation. Mimblewimble, a protocol used by Grin and Beam, hides transaction details and uses aggregate verification techniques.ZKPs, used by currencies like Zcash and mixing services like Tornado Cash, verify transactions without revealing details, posing substantial tracing challenges.Furthermore, L2 solutions like the Lightning Network for Bitcoin create payment channels that do not broadcast all transactions to the blockchain, complicating law enforcement tracking efforts.Future stepsThe report noted the paramount need for law enforcement to keep up with technological developments and emphasized that access to suspects’ private keys is critical for overcoming encryption challenges.The report also urged state agencies to enhance technical capabilities and foster closer collaboration with crypto exchanges and custodial wallet providers, which are essential for effectively tackling the misuse of digital assets for criminal purposes.The report called for continued research into “user-controlled” encryption and its impact on digital forensics and decryption capabilities. It also highlighted quantum computing’s potential to revolutionize cryptographic protocols and said that EU funding schemes are vital for supporting research projects to address these challenges.The report urged policymakers to prioritize funding to enhance law enforcement’s ability to counteract the misuse of cryptocurrencies.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Biggest Bank in the World Says Ethereum Is ‘Digital Oil,’ Bitcoin ‘Digital Gold’: Report - The Daily Hodl


								The world’s biggest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), is reportedly calling Bitcoin (BTC) “digital gold” and Ethereum (ETH) “digital oil.”
In a new report shared by Matthew Siegel, VanEck’s head of digital assets, the ICBC gives praise to the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap.










The report also says that market demand is strong for digital assets, pushing innovation in the sector.
“Market demand drives the continuous iteration of digital currencies.” 
The report draws comparisons between Bitcoin and gold while also saying the crypto king has added benefits.
“Bitcoin retains the scarcity similar to gold through mathematical consensus, while solving its problem of being difficult to divide, difficult to identify authenticity and inconvenient to carry. Its monetary attributes are gradually weakening, while its asset attributes are constantly strengthening.” 
In calling Ethereum “digital oil,” the report praises various characteristics of the top smart contract platform’s ecosystem. While ICBC highlights some of the network’s shortcomings, it also believes technological advances will resolve them over time.
“Ethereum has been continuously upgrading its technology in terms of security, scalability, and sustainability, providing technical power for the digital future… 
Ethereum introduces Turing completeness with its exclusive programming language (Solidity) and virtual machine (EVM), allowing developers to write and arrange for a variety of complex smart contracts and applications, providing a strong platform support for blockchain technology. Its flexibility has been widely recognized in the fields of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT), and is gradually extending to the physical infrastructure network (DePin). 
In essence, Ethereum’s Turing completeness enables it to execute any programming instructions under the premise of correct instructions and sufficient resources, but it also poses several practical problems… 
Looking ahead, Ethereum developers will continue to work on finding the Pareto optimum between sustainability, security and efficiency.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $66,502 at time of writing, down 5% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading for $3,464 at time of writing, down more than 6% on the day.

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $10 billion market cap in the second half of the year


    The cryptocurrency market experienced volatile trading last week, starting on a high note only to reverse course by week’s end. Initially, optimism surged as several analysts predicted Bitcoin (BTC) would reach new highs. 



However, the release of robust U.S. job data on Friday altered the sentiment, resulting in a downturn in the crypto markets.



Despite this, several cryptocurrencies are approaching significant market cap milestones, including the notable $10 billion mark.







Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies likely to surpass this threshold. These predictions hinge not only on market conditions but also on the potential benefits of high supply inflation, which could lead to an increased market cap even if price movements remain minimal.



Polkadot (DOT)



Polkadot (DOT), currently trading at $6.34 with a market cap of $9.14 billion, is on track to hit a $10 billion market cap by year-end.



Despite recent market fluctuations, its ecosystem continues to grow, with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $70,383  and key projects like Energy Web, Xcavate, and Phyken Network showcasing its expanding influence in the blockchain space.

Polkadot’s integration of Real-World Assets (RWAs) and the upcoming release of Polkadot 2.0 are clear indicators of its commitment to innovation and mass adoption.







The increasing adoption of Polkadot’s Software Development Kit (SDK) for asset tokenization and the positive outlook from industry experts like Michaël van de Poppe strengthen its market position. 



These strategic developments, along with Polkadot’s strong framework for asset tokenization, suggest substantial growth potential, making the $10 billion market cap a realistic target.



Chainlink (LINK)



Chainlink (LINK), currently trading at $14.87 with a market cap of $8.73 billion, has strong potential to reach a $10 billion market cap soon. 



Despite a recent 7.39% one-day decrease and trading 23% below its yearly high of $22.85, Chainlink’s innovative developments and growing ecosystem continue to drive investor confidence.



A recent collaboration with The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and major U.S. financial institutions like JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM) and BNY Mellon underscores its potential.

The successful pilot project, Smart NAV, demonstrated the use of Chainlink’s interoperability protocol CCIP to standardize and disseminate net asset value (NAV) data across blockchains. 



This project highlighted Chainlink’s role in enabling on-chain use cases such as tokenized funds and smart contracts. 



With such significant industry support and real-world applications, Chainlink is on track to achieve a $10 billion market cap.



It’s worth noting that despite being supported by several fundamentals, the possibility of the highlighted cryptocurrencies reaching the $10 billion mark will largely depend on market conditions.

Ethereum Buying Pressure Reaches Critical Level Amid Massive Whale Buying


																Institutional investors have been accumulating Ethereum at a rapid pace after the SEC’s recent approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that this accumulation trend has created buying pressure that could be the much-needed catalyst for Ethereum to break above the $4,000 price mark.
According to a social media post by Ali Martinez, the number of Ethereum addresses holding over 10,000 ETH tokens has increased by 3% in the last three weeks, showing a positive trend among large investors. 
Whales Accumulating Pushes Ethereum Buying Pressure
Speculation over ETF approvals and increasing institutional buy-in have helped fuel Ethereum’s price increase earlier this year. The first price surge occurred in February when multiple reports came out of the SEC potentially approving Spot Ethereum ETF applications after the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs.

	Related Reading


 This saw the price of Ethereum surging over 83% throughout the month to reach above $4,000 again for the first time since 2021. Similarly, court rulings in May, which increased the odds of Spot Ethereum ETF approval, pushed the price of ETH above $3,000 again. 
Now that the SEC has finally approved these spot ETF applications, institutional investors are taking the chance to load up their portfolios with Ethereum. According to Glassnode data, this accumulation, which has been going on for the past three weeks, has pushed the number of wallets holding over 10,000 ETH past 975 and steadily approaching 1,000 addresses. Furthermore, data shows that the number of ETH mega-whale addresses has steadily increased in the past 30 days, with the recent metric showing an addition of 15 whale addresses. 

On-chain data also reveals that social sentiment for ETH has stabilized after intense enthusiasm post-Spot Ethereum ETF approval. However, this hasn’t stopped the massive withdrawal from exchanges, leading Ethereum to become scarcer on centralized exchanges. This trend has now seen the Ethereum balance on centralized exchanges dropping below Bitcoin, even as Spot Bitcoin ETF wallets also accumulate Bitcoins. According to Glassnode data, less than 10.56% of Ethereum’s total supply is currently held on major exchanges.  
ETH Price Outlook: What’s Next After Critical Buying Pressure?
With whales doubling down on Ethereum, the buying pressure has reached a critical point. This surge of interest signals a very bullish outlook for Ethereum’s price in the coming months, although there could be short-term volatility. 

	Related Reading


At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,527 and has fallen 3.83% in the past 24 hours. While the increase in buying pressure is a good start, the bulls still have some work to do to push Ethereum’s price higher. The first major resistance wall is around $3,700, where 1.82 million addresses hold 1.8 million ETH.

Is This One of the Reasons for Today's Big Decline in Bitcoin? Here's the 535 Million Dollar Worth Transaction - Bitcoin Sistemi


Data provided by cryptocurrency analysis company Arkham reveals that a wallet that has been dormant for a long time has been carrying a large amount of Bitcoin.
According to data, a cryptocurrency wallet that has been dormant for 5.5 years without any movement moved 8,000 Bitcoins, which corresponds to approximately $ 535 million, at the time of writing.


The data shows that the BTC assets in question were distributed across a number of different cryptocurrency wallets, four of which belonged to Binance deposit addresses. The amount transferred to Binance was recorded as 1,416 BTC.
The giant whale wallet paid approximately $108 in fees for the transfer of the $535 million BTC in question.






The overall cryptocurrency market witnessed an unexpected decline today. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has decreased by approximately 4.57% in the last 24 hours. With the decline, the BTC price fell below $ 67,000 and is trading at $ 66,588 at the time of writing.
The general reason for the decrease is thought to be that both CPI and interest rate decision data will come from the USA tomorrow.

Bitcoin's Value Is ‘Many Multiples’ Above Its Current Price: Billionaire Investor Bill Miller - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsLegendary investor Bill Miller says he’s “still betting on Bitcoin,” which has ample room to rise despite currently trading close to all-time highs.In a Tuesday article, the billionaire argued that Bitcoin’s “intrinsic value” is “many multiples” of its market cap today and that the asset is at the center of a “secular shift around how humans think about capital and its governance.”“The promise of Bitcoin is simple,” Miller wrote. “Namely, that changes in someone’s purchasing power should not be controlled by an authority tied to the circumstances of one’s birth.”Given that its blockchain-based accounting is “far superior” to all fiat alternatives, the investor claimed Bitcoin’s $1.5 trillion market cap is a fraction of a percent of its total addressable market.Miller has been one of Bitcoin’s most vocal high-net-worth proponents for several years. In 2015, Miller Value Partners published “A Value Investor’s Case For Bitcoin,” which claimed Bitcoin “could have enormous upside if it catches on” as a store of value similar to gold, and captured the precious metal’s market cap. At the time, that model would have brought Bitcoin’s price to $314,000 per coin.Miller assigned just a 0.25% probability of this happening back then, but today he doesn’t find it so farfetched—especially in a fiat world fast approaching “a quadrillion dollars” of total capital.“Humans are notoriously bad at contextualizing the relevance and potential of new technologies,” he said.Miller’s track record suggests he has a knack for spotting good investments. During his time at Legg Mason, he’s known for investments that outperformed the stock market for fifteen straight years from 1991 to 2005. He also purchased Amazon (AMZN) stock at its IPO in 1997, which has exploded over 205,000% since.In 2022, Miller revealed that his portfolio was split 50/50 between both Amazon and Bitcoin—and that he was buying the latter asset with leverage.“I believe that continuing to ignore Bitcoin will serve those who do it over the next decade as well as it has over the past one—not well,” he concluded in his latest piece. “It’s still early.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Andrew Tate's $1M Solana Meme Coin Investment Causes Stir Amidst Facing Criminal Charges - Benzinga

Controversial influencer Andrew Tate has stirred up social media with his announcement of a $1 million investment in Solana meme coins, despite facing serious criminal charges.Tate, known for his provocative online presence, announced on Friday his plans to invest heavily in various Solana-based meme coins. This move has sparked a frenzy on social media, with followers promoting their meme coins for his potential investment.Don’t Miss:Tate’s investment claims, however, may be exaggerated. Evidence suggests that he has spent significantly less than the announced $1 million. This is not his first venture into the crypto world, as he previously expressed interest in investing in Bitcoin.Earlier this year, Tate claimed on an X post that he made $85 million on the last DeFi Bull Run on Pancake and prefaced it with telling his followers that as great as meme coins are, there are “genuinely technological useful or innovating blockchain coins”.Despite his ongoing legal troubles, including serious charges in Romania and a pending extradition request from British authorities, Tate’s bold crypto investment announcements have kept the public’s attention on him.His recent announcement to invest in various “junk” tokens is seen by some as a distraction from these legal issues, while also highlighting the unpredictable market influence of such popular figures.While some critics question the legitimacy of his claims, his public statements reflect a broader pattern of controversial actions designed to maintain public attention.Read Next:Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Just Don’t Call It Blockchain: Apple's New AI Privacy Tech Explained - Decrypt

Apple is taking a deep dive into AI with its new Apple Intelligence suite of features across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. While some requests will, with user permission, be routed to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a top exec says Apple's own AI services rely on a “blockchain-ish” model to ensure user privacy.But what does that really mean? Following Apple's keynote presentation, its Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi and SVP of Machine Learning and AI Strategy John Giannandrea took the stage for a press interview about the consumer tech giant’s big AI push, moderated by content creator Justine “iJustine” Ezarik.Asked how Apple would make sure its customer information remained private if it leaves their devices, Federighi explained that user requests sent to Apple servers are anonymized, as their IP addresses are masked and the server itself is prevented from keeping a log of information. On top of that, an image of the server software will be publicly shared so that it can be audited by independent security researchers, and user devices will only interact with servers with auditable software.“It’s a clever kind of blockchain-ish attestation log to make sure the iPhone will only trust the software that’s been publicly put out there,” Federighi said, adding that Apple will soon issue a white paper about its security model. “It’s a really extraordinary step up in terms of the level of trust you can place in server computing.”As the company dives deeper into AI and the personal data it uses to deliver its services, he added, “it’s essential that you can know that no one—not Apple, not anyone else—would have access to any of the information used to process your request.”One of Apple’s most prominent executives indeed said that the firm is using “blockchain-ish” tech—but Federighi did not say specifically that the firm is using an actual blockchain, and certainly didn’t say that the tech juggernaut is building on a decentralized model.Decrypt reached out to Apple to clarify Federighi’s comments, but did not immediately receive a response.What it meansApple shared some details in an extensive security blog post on Monday about Private Cloud Compute (PCC), which Apple designed to handle user requests. As Federighi noted, it anonymizes user requests and then relies on servers that use publicly auditable software to handle those AI needs.Apple calls that last point “Verifiable Transparency.” Sound familiar?In essence, Apple will make its software images public to prove that its system is secure. Then, it will build a check into the system to ensure that devices can only interact with servers that use software that’s been shared publicly for auditing purposes. And that system is built with cryptography.“This promise, too, is an enforceable guarantee: user devices will be willing to send data only to PCC nodes that can cryptographically attest to running publicly listed software,” the post reads, with a bullet point further emphasizing that Apple will be “publishing the measurements of all code running on PCC in an append-only and cryptographically tamper-proof transparency log.”Furthermore, the post adds: “Specifically, the user’s device will wrap its request payload key only to the public keys of those PCC nodes whose attested measurements match a software release in the public transparency log. And the same strict code signing technologies that prevent loading unauthorized software also ensure that all code on the PCC node is included in the attestation.”Public keys? Nodes? A “cryptographically tamper-proof transparency log,” of all things? It’s not difficult to understand why Federighi would call it a “blockchain-ish” approach. It’s also easy to see why crypto-natives are taking shots at Apple on social media for not actually calling it a blockchain when it apparently shares so many commonalities.“Say blockchains without saying blockchains,” tweeted Wei Dai, Research Partner at crypto investment firm 1KX, with a screenshot from the blog post.But while the Private Cloud Compute model is designed to be transparent and invites public scrutiny, Apple is not launching a decentralized network: It’s still ultimately running the show as a centralized player. There’s no decentralized consensus model in play, and users still ultimately have to trust what Apple is saying regarding its privacy mechanisms.“That’s not my read,” tweeted Riccardo “fluffypony” Spagni, founder of privacy coin Monero, in reply to Dai. “I think it’s more like a linked list, or actually more like [Github]. There’s no consensus mechanism here, there’s a central publisher.”“This isn’t a blockchain,” Spagni added in a further reply.However, Apple has been exploring the potential for blockchain tech. In a patent application filed in 2023 and published earlier this year, Apple sought to patent a “Distributed Network Management System“ that explicitly mentions the potential use of blockchain in some implementations. Elsewhere, a recently granted Apple patent describes a “decentralized ledger” used in the process of publishing media assets.Private Cloud Compute isn’t a blockchain, based on what we know so far. But Apple said in its security post that more details are forthcoming, and the firm doesn’t appear to have shut the door on potential use cases for blockchain tech. What’s here is “blockchain-ish,” at least, in the words of Craig Federighi—and that’s an interesting claim from Apple all the same.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

SushiSwap dissolves DAO, repositions as Sushi Labs with new council structure - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Decentralized exchange SushiSwap has rebranded as Sushi Labs, an autonomous company replacing the protocol’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), although the SushiSwap name will still be used for its DEX-focused operations.In a bid to address slowing growth and liquidity issues, SushiSwap has introduced a new business model under the name Sushi Labs. The revamp replaces the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with a “council structure” similar to that of derivatives protocol Synthetix.Sushi Labs will operate under four councils: the Sushi High Kitchen, the Treasury Council, the Grants Council, and the Ambassador Council. The High Kitchen, comprising six to eight members, will serve as the central governing body overseeing a multisig setup for transactions.Jared Grey, now Sushi Labs’ managing director, asserted that the new organizational structure, budget, and leveraging of successful products like Route Processor will help enhance liquidity on the Sushi DEX.
“Many attribute Sushi’s stagnated growth and AMM liquidity issues to LPs migrating to other DEXs and seeking better yield. However, with our newly established organizational structure, sufficient budget, and leveraging successful products like Route Processor, we have the tools to enhance liquidity on the Sushi DEX,” Grey explains.
The transition also involves a shift to a multitoken product suite, which Sushi claims will help distribute product costs and provide more reward opportunities for token holders.While the move has sparked debate and criticism for its centralized nature, with some community members accusing the protocol of a hostile takeover, Sushi maintains that the changes are necessary to address financial challenges and improve liquidity management.The decentralized exchange generated $1.62 million in fees in May 2023, a sharp decline compared to its performance during the previous bull cycle.

Could Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Lose Key Support Due to Selling?


Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price continues to show a drawdown in response to rapidly developing bearish market conditions.
The surge in selling and declining confidence among SHIB holders will potentially catalyze the correction.
Shiba Inu Investors Lose Optimism

Shiba Inu’s price could decline in the coming days as SHIB holders continue to sell their holdings. The total supply on the exchange has noted a sharp uptick, bringing it to a six-month high.
In the last 48 hours, the wallets across all exchanges have risen by more than 4.66 trillion SHIB. This $103 million worth of supply has been sold off by investors looking to secure whatever gains they have accumulated. The selling could also have been the result of investors offsetting their losses.

This sentiment to prevent further losses has also been extended to some of the most secure investors. Long-term holders known for their resilience have been moving their assets.

In the last few days, multiple spikes have been noted in the age-consumed metric. This metric calculates the total days lost by multiplying the total supply moved with the total number of days it has been since the last move.
Spikes in the same hint at large amounts of supplies or very old coins moving, both of which are bearish for the asset.

Thus, Shiba Inu’s price could be observed to be at a drawdown for these reasons.
SHIB Price Prediction: One Last Support

Shiba Inu’s price has already failed the breach of $0.00002584 and fallen out of the consolidation between this level and $0.00002267. The meme coin is now headed towards the critical support at $0.00002093, which has not been broken since April.
There is a chance of a drop below it, potentially sending SHIB to $0.00002000. This would mark a multi-month low for the asset.

But if Shiba Inu’s price bounces back from $0.00002093, it could recover slightly. This would result in SHIB’s continuing consolidation, also invalidating the bearish thesis.

Analysts Remain Optimistic Despite Large Ethereum Sell-Off


							

A massive $1.1 billion Ethereum dump was made by a wallet collecting ETH since November 2018.



Ethereum’s current market behavior is seen as a precursor to a bullish altcoin season.



Market sentiment remains optimistic with predictions of a $10k ETH in the current bull run.




An Ethereum whale transaction has captured the attention of the crypto community. A wallet, which had been accumulating Ethereum since November 11, 2018, executed a massive $1.1 billion sale, split into two transactions of 150,000 ETH each. The identity behind these transactions remains unknown, but the sheer size of the trade has sparked widespread discussion and analysis.







Despite this large-scale sell-off, market sentiment towards Ethereum and altcoins remains notably optimistic. Prominent voices in the crypto community, such as ParabolicPump, argue that Ethereum’s price movements are indicative of broader market trends. 



According to ParabolicPump, Ethereum’s price chart suggests the market is still within a bullish cycle that has yet to peak. The current live price of Ethereum stands at $3,532.80, reflecting a 3.77% decrease over the past 24 hours. However, this short-term dip has not dampened the long-term outlook.









Crypto analysts suggest that the current price action is intended to shake out weaker holders, and as the bull cycle continues, significant gains are anticipated. Ethereum has not yet reached new all-time highs in the current cycle, as highlighted by ParabolicPump, who projects that Ethereum’s price could reach $10,000. Reaching this milestone would likely spark more interest from retail investors, further driving the market.



This optimistic outlook extends beyond Ethereum to the altcoin space. Analysts believe that near the end of the cycle, altcoins will see their biggest price fluctuations. Known as “Altseason,” this period is marked by parabolic increases for numerous altcoins, propelled by the popularity of prominent cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum.







The recent Ethereum sale and the ongoing bullish sentiment present a complex landscape for investors. While large whale movements can signal potential market volatility, the overarching narrative suggests continued growth.

This Is Why Bitcoin Could Rally Post-FOMC Meeting


Bitcoin’s price has consistently exhibited notable volatility around Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. 
Historical data from recent meetings indicates that Bitcoin tends to experience a drop in value before the FOMC’s interest rate decisions, followed by significant gains post-announcement.
Bitcoin Dips Before FOMC, Rallies Post Fed Decision

The Federal Open Market Committee is a branch of the Federal Reserve System responsible for overseeing the nation’s open market operations. The FOMC meetings are crucial events where key decisions on the interest rate at which banks lend to each other and monetary policy are made.
These meetings typically occur eight times a year and involve a thorough discussion of the US economy and the various factors influencing its performance.
On December 13, 2023, the FOMC decided to hold rates steady between 5.25% and 5.50%. Leading up to this meeting, Bitcoin’s price fell by 8.76%. However, after the announcement, Bitcoin surged by 22.07%. This pattern repeated on January 31, 2024, when the FOMC again held rates steady, causing a 4.55% drop in Bitcoin’s value before the meeting and a 26.34% increase afterward.

The trend continued on March 20, 2024, with Bitcoin dropping 11.82% before the FOMC meeting and rising 18.09% post-decision. Similarly, on May 1, 2024, Bitcoin saw a 12.69% decline before the rates were held steady and a 15.95% rise after the announcement.

Looking ahead to the upcoming FOMC meeting on June 12, 2024, Bitcoin has already dropped 8.25%. US Senators Elizabeth Warren, Jacky Rosen, and John Hickenlooper have urged the Federal Reserve to cut rates, citing the adverse effects of current monetary policy on inflation and the economy. 


“The Fed’s monetary policy is not helping to reduce inflation. Indeed, it is driving up housing and auto insurance costs—two of the key drivers of inflation—threatening the health of the economy and risking a recession that could push thousands of American workers out of their jobs,” the senators stated in their letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

Given the historical data, market watchers anticipate a potential rebound in Bitcoin’s price post-announcement. The consistent pattern suggests that regardless of the Fed’s decision, Bitcoin often recovers and even thrives after the initial uncertainty surrounding the FOMC meetings dissipates.
Understanding these trends can help investors make informed decisions, balancing the risks and opportunities presented by Bitcoin’s inherent volatility around major economic announcements.

New Crypto IEO To Watch - eTukTuk ($TUK) Listings Soon


This article was paid for*
One of the hottest crypto presales of 2024 – eTukTuk ($TUK) – is now in its final stages and could end soon. The presale has already raised over $3.4 million, a sign of its strong demand and the growing potential of green cryptocurrencies. 
eTukTuk’s play-to-earn game – inspired by Crazy Taxi – as well as its long-term goal of popularizing eTukTuks in developing nations such as Sri Lanka have caught the attention of smart money traders. 
A few popular YouTube trading experts such as Gain Trading Crypto have tipped eTukTuk as the next 100x cryptocurrency.

Earn Rewards for Playing eTukTuk’s P2E Games
The eTukTuk project identifies renewable energy to be the need of the hour, with climate change and global warming becoming increasingly dire every year. For instance, UK-based NGO Christian Aid reported that extreme weather – caused by anthropogenic climate change – is costing $41 billion globally. 
eTukTuk has come up with a unique solution to combat this issue and raise awareness about the worsening crisis. 
It has launched play-to-earn games – now available on both Android and iOS devices – inspired by the popular Crazy Taxi game. Players can race their eTukTuks through the vibrant streets of Sri Lanka, win and earn free crypto in the form of additional $TUK tokens. 

Players can continue to unlock new cities, upgrade their vehicles and earn bonus rewards, simply by continuing to participate in the thrilling races. Additionally, investors can stake their $TUK holdings and earn passive income, currently at an APY of over 80%. 

However, its play-to-earn games are only a part of the broader eTukTuk solution. 
The project aims to create an EV movement in developing nations such as Sri Lanka by tackling common obstacles. For instance, it is creating charging stations in remote areas, ensuring that the eTukTuks become just as viable as the fossil fuel-based tuk-tuks that are prevalent in these nations. 
Similarly, eTukTuk is looking to launch its own Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs), a more cost-effective and sustainable alternative to the common tuk-tuks. 
eTukTuk Price Prediction From Experts
As previously mentioned, smart money traders are backing eTukTuk as one of the most important new crypto IEOs to watch, owing to its play-to-earn utility as well as its strong performance during the presale. 
In a recent video, popular trader Michael Wrubel – who has over 300k subscribers – claimed to be bullish on eTukTuk.

Similarly, Cilinix Crypto tipped $TUK as an excellent long-term investment.

eTukTuk could also be one of the cryptocurrencies that benefit significantly from Elon Musk and the upcoming US presidential elections. 
For instance, a recent report highlighted that Elon Musk could land an advisory role in the Trump administration. Despite Musk’s recent conservative leanings, he remains an avid supporter of renewable energy, especially EVs, considering his ownership of Tesla. 
Being one of the top green crypto presales, eTukTuk could witness a significant bounce in such a scenario. $TUK could even be one of the rare crypto tokens that could benefit from a Biden victory, considering the Democrat’s pro-renewable energy stance. 
Interested buyers looking to get into eTukTuk early have no time to lose, considering that its presale is now in its final stages. They can head to the eTukTuk website and use the over-the-counter widget to purchase the token.

US gov’t chasing USDT held on Binance after $1M pig-butchering scam


The US has launched a forfeiture complaint against almost $200,000 worth of tether (USDT) held on Binance in connection to pig-butchering scams that stole over $1 million. That’s according to documents filed in the District Court of Columbia.
The court claims that the USDT represents the proceeds of “wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering, and money laundering conspiracy.” 
According to the documents submitted on June 7, an anonymous victim of two pig-butchering scams, reported to the police that they had lost roughly $1.1 million between January 2021 and December 2022. 
The victim first developed a romantic relationship with a scammer known as Eva Markus on Facebook Dating, believing they were an engineer and diamond mine owner. Markus convinced the victim her diamond mine had exploded and that she needed the funds to hire an attorney to return to America. The victim transferred more than $400,000.

The victim then started a second romantic relationship with another woman on Facebook Dating claiming to be called Lisa Warren. Warren claimed to invest in crypto and convinced the victim, who was looking to recoup their losses from Markus, to send her $55,000 in bitcoin as an investment.
The victim was then persuaded to sell their home and hand over the profits as a crypto investment, altogether sending roughly $600,000 in crypto. However, after some digging and recovering only $15,000 in funds, the victim realized they had been scammed and alerted the police. 
Binance froze USDT for FBI 
The bitcoin sent to Warren’s wallet address was used to track down the illicit funds. Authorities discovered funds from the Markus scam had been mostly cashed out but that roughly half of the funds lost to Warren remained intact. 
The FBI traced the crypto transactions to a Binance account held under the name Izuchukwu Henry Okolo. Binance discovered in November 2023 that Okolo had converted their bitcoin to 196,721 USDT. The exchange froze the funds and alerted the FBI who later seized them.
Binance has come under increased scrutiny after US regulators appointed legal firm Sullivan & Cromwell and forensic accounting expert Forensic Risk Alliance to monitor the exchange. The firms will check that Binance is adhering to money-laundering and sanction laws following its $4.3 billion settlement with the US government. 
The documents also disclose that criminals involved in the pig butchering scams may be victims themselves. The US has also found Okolo’s submitted claims about the nature of the seized USDT to be false.
