The Big Day Has Arrived: Crucial Bitcoin-related Data to Be Released on Wednesday - Bitcoin Sistemi


The cryptocurrency community is eagerly awaiting the announcement of investors behind Bitcoin ETFs as May 15th approaches. This important date marks the deadline for investors managing assets over $100 million to file “13-F Filings” with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and reveal their holdings in publicly traded assets.
These applications, which must be made 45 days after the end of a quarter of the year, can give an idea about the investment strategies of large companies in the market. Although they do not cover every investor and represent just a moment in time, the upcoming announcements are expected to bring positive surprises regarding institutional participation in Bitcoin ETFs.


13F filings are defined as documents required quarterly by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in eligible assets. If you're big enough to be in this lane, you have to disclose to the world your U.S.-traded stocks, options, and now Bitcoin ETFs as of the last day of the quarter.
But here's the kicker: not all 13F applications are equal. Not all of them signal true investment confidence.






Take, for example, market makers and high-frequency trading firms such as Citadel Securities, Susquehanna International Group (SIG), Renaissance Technologies, and Virtu Financial. For example, unlike Berkshire Hathaway indicating a bullish outlook on an announced position, Citadels and SIGs often trade swings to profit from small differences between bid and ask prices. Their holdings generally reflect high-volume trading rather than a long-term belief in the assets. Therefore, it pays to be careful when examining 13Fs.

Contextualizing Crypto Volatility: History of Bitcoin Crashes

Cryptocurrency has raised exposure to innovative concepts and opportunities, changed economic paradigms, and become the “new economy.” Although cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly familiar in every corner of the world, crypto volatility is just like nothing before. Currency can play for bigger profits or, on the other hand, greater losses in a very short time. Understanding the nature of Bitcoin and other crypto volatility is important.  
Crypto volatility means the unpredictable price nature of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has a history of great price volatility in bursts with periodic crashes. Market sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic factors cause sudden big drops in its price.
What is Crypto Volatility?
Volatility measures the amount of an asset’s price that has fluctuated over time. In general, the volatility of an asset indicates how risky the investors perceive it to be and how much potential it exhibits for delivering higher returns or bigger losses over time horizons of shorter duration than the relatively less volatile money.
As cryptocurrencies are a relatively new asset class, they are commonly viewed as having potentially huge gains and losses in short periods. The digital assets possess high volatility, as in the case of “penny stocks,” to relatively quieter large-cap corners. On the other hand, bonds show lower volatility, where they normally move less sharply up or down over long periods.
Measurement of Crypto Volatility
When measuring volatility, it commonly refers to “historical volatility,” resulting from the analysis of prices on a given period, usually 30 days back, a year or more. Because the future is impossible to predict with certainty, the science of “implied volatility” — which offers an educated guess about what’s to come – stands as far less exact even as it serves as the foundation for such popular financial tools as the Cboe Volatility Index, often termed the “fear index” because it predicts stock market volatility over the next 30 days.   
There are two methods for quantifying crypto volatility:

One way to do this is to employ beta, The beta measures how volatile a stock is relative to the entire market (usually using the S&P 500 for that gauge).
The standard deviation of an asset, which indicates how much its price has deviated from its historical average, can be calculated.

The Importance of Crypto Volatility
Volatility is among the main elements used to determine a particular investment’s risk. Normally, investors take on quite a bit of risk if the potential gain from an investment is such that there is an equal chance that the investor might lose some of the initial investment. (Everything they’d invested is gone — as in the case of high-risk hedge-fund manager Bill Hwang, whose entire $20bn fund vanished in two days.)

5 Proven Tips to Protect Your Money During a Crypto Crash.

If anything, the retail investor usually has it as a mantra that they should be aware that they should diversify risk by spreading their holdings within an asset class. One typically well-liked way is investing in an index fund or a basket of stocks instead of buying a select few. This may also be coupled with diversification of investments in low volatile assets, such as bonds, at the same time as they have investments in more volatile asset categories, such as stocks, to minimize even further the chances of any investment giving negative returns.
Despite the cryptocurrency asset class being only a bit over a decade old, which has led to numerous very sharp run-ups followed by retrenchments and considered as, on balance, more volatile than stocks the increased trading volumes and greater institutional participation witnessed in Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, appear to be diminishing its volatility over time. When trying emerging crypto assets like DeFi tokens or cryptocurrencies with lower trading volumes, it’s best practice to risk amounts you can afford to lose, as these are usually experiences with higher volatility. 

Crypto volatility arises from positive or negative news coverage and better or worse than estimated quarterly results. Crypto volatility is primarily attributed to irregular spikes, such that the level of trading volume can be exceptionally high. Low volume normally means high crypto volatility, such as dealing with smaller cryptocurrencies or penny stocks not traded on major markets.
Can We Reduce Crypto Volatility?
And while its crypto volatility has been decreasing of late, bitcoin often moves by double-digit percentage amounts in a single week, presenting ample opportunity for tactics such as “buying the dip.” Moreover, its high crypto volatility makes it attractive to some cryptocurrency investors as it gives the potential for big returns.

What Happens to Crypto if Binance Goes Bankrupt?

Dollar-cost averaging can reduce the negative effects of crypto volatility for less risk-tolerant people. Longer-term investors generally do not pay as much need to concern themselves with short-term fluctuations because they have every reason to believe that an investment will eventually rise over time.  Stablecoins, such as USD Coin and Dai, are less volatile cryptocurrencies – their value is set to some reserve asset, such as the US dollar.
An Overview of Bitcoin Crashes in The Past 
In 2022, Bitcoin (BTC) saw one of the worst crashes in history, with the price of BTC falling below $20,000 in June 2022, following a peak of $68,000 in November 2021. Since September 2011, June 2022 has been the worst month for Bitcoin due to monthly losses that have reached 40%.
Additionally, the cryptocurrency reported its worst quarterly losses in eleven years. Nevertheless, bear markets and Bitcoin crashes are not limited to 2022 due to the present market sell-off. In fact, since the genesis block—the first block of Bitcoin—was mined in January 2009, the cryptocurrency has witnessed its fair share of crypto winters. When we pan out the Bitcoin price chart, we can find the following five most significant price drops in its history.
Bitcoin Crashed From 32 USD to 0.01 USD in 2011
In April 2011, the price of Bitcoin broke through its first significant psychological barrier of $1, igniting the first-ever rally that saw it reach $32 on June 8, 2011. Happiness, however, was short-lived as the value of Bitcoin then crashed, bottoming out at just $0.01 over a few days.
The sharp sell-off was mainly instigated by security flaws at the now-defunct Mt. Gox, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange that conducted the majority of Bitcoin trades then. The theft of 850,000 BTC was a security breach in the exchange’s platform, raising serious questions about the safety of Bitcoin that it staked on exchanges.

The flash crash in June 2011 kept that part of the significant Bitcoin history when BTC lost almost 99% of its value through a very short period, measured in a few days. The event started long before Bitcoin bounced its price back to the previous high of $32, and new all-time highs were reached in February 2013.
Trying to follow pre-2013 Bitcoin price charts is akin to comparing them with more recent ones. Established lineament price tracking services or websites such as CoinGecko, for instance, or CoinMarketCap did not track prices of the Bitcoin before April 2013.
Bitcoin Crashed From $1,000 to $200 in 2015
Data on BTC price depicts that Bitcoin peaked in mid-April 2013 at $100. Riding up ever since for the first time in history, it touched $1,000 in November of 2013.

Top 5 Tips For Newbie Bitcoin Investors: Here’s What You Need To Know

Less than a month after crushing the $1,000 barrier for the first time, Bitcoin embarked on one of its most savage bear market runs in history. The decline in value coincided with the crackdown on Bitcoin by the Chinese central bank in late 2013, which prohibited regional financial institutions from processing transactions involving the said cryptocurrency.

Prices of the cryptocurrencies continued to spiral down in the ensuing two years, hitting a low of $170 in January 2015 after first bottoming out at around $360 in April 2014.
December of 2013 ushered in the extended cryptocurrency winter of 2014, linked to the compromised Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange that was refusing Bitcoin withdrawals during the first few days of February 2014 – any trades made with the platform stopped after this point and ultimately ended in bankruptcy between the US and Tokyo.
Several other leading financial authorities around the world also aired concerns regarding Bitcoin. In 2014, late in the year, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission claimed its authority over “Bitcoin price manipulation.”
Before a long-term trend started a reversal in August 2015, the general sentiment concerning Bitcoin was mostly bearish. In January 2017, between a healthy bull market, for the first time since then, the price of Bitcoin reached $1,000 again. In the history of Bitcoin, this was the longest price recovery period from an all-time high.
Bitcoin Falls Below $3,200 After Reaching $20,000 in December 2017
In January 2017, Bitcoin recovered to $1,000, and by the end of the year, it had reached a high of $20,000.

However, similar to the $1,000 high in the history of Bitcoin, its triumph of $20,000 was short-lived as the cryptocurrency plummeted and lost over 60% of its value in just months.
So, the Bitcoin market decided to continue its way down in 2018, and the year with lightning speed soon was christened on exchanges as “crypto winter” – by December 2018, bitcoins fell only to a low of about 3,200 dollars.
Alarm bells for the commencement of the crypto winter were ringing over security concerns at Coincheck, another Japan-based cryptocurrency exchange. Coincheck was hit by a massive hack in January 2018, which resulted in the loss of around $530m NEM (NEM) cryptocurrency.

The bear market worsened when the tech giants Facebook and Google issued bans on ads for initial coin offerings and token sales in March and June 2018, respectively.
One of these initiatives contributing to the bear market was the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision to reject applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.
Bitcoin Drops From $63,000 to $29,000 in 2021
However, until 2020, the cryptocurrency market was mostly bearish, as with the retracing of Bitcoin to $20,000 – and more so in the latter half of 2018 to $3,000 – it started a new massive bull run that outpaced every other run before it and peaked at above $63k in April 2021.

Despite the slight setback, it became one of the crucial years for Bitcoin in which the cryptocurrency crossed the $1 trillion market cap.
After hitting new highs in mid-April, Bitcoin drew back a little but dropped its price to as low as $29,000 in three months.
The 2021 mini-bear market came with a growing media narrative insinuating that there are some environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) problems posed by Bitcoin mining.
The global ESG-related FUD around Bitcoin became even louder when Tesla, Elon Musk’s electric car company, dumped Bitcoin as payment in May on ESG concerns. Just three months later, Musk admitted that about half of Bitcoin mining was powered by renewable energy.
The bear market was short-lived despite a major crackdown on local mining farms that followed China. The bullish trend had returned by the end of July, and eventually, Bitcoin would go up to its still-unbroken all-time high of $68,000 set in November 2021.
Bitcoin Plummets From $68,000 to Below $20,000 in 2022
Bitcoin failed to break through above $70,000 and started declining in late 2021. Since the November season of last year, cryptocurrency has been experiencing a bear market with its largest historical crashers during December 2022.
In June, the cryptocurrency fell below $20,000 for the first time since 2020, fueling market panic.
The crisis of algorithmic stablecoins happens with the TerraUSD Classic (USTC) stablecoin being held to a 1:1 peg against US dollars through blockchain algorithms instead of equivalent cash reserves.

USTC, a major algorithmic stablecoin, lost its dollar peg in May. One of the most violent de-pegging saw USTC end as it skyrocketed to break into the podium of the third-largest stablecoins before it faced its demise.

A cryptocurrency lending crisis fueled huge liquidations and uncertainty caused by the Terra consortium, and the former had a domino effect on the rest of the cryptocurrency market. 

Conclusion
The history of Bitcoin crashes is a crypto volatility story and has elements of resilience, adaptation, and growth. In creating one’s path through the cryptocurrency markets’ bumpy ride, treading with some nuance on how they come about will be critical. Learning from the past, appreciating the impact of human behavior, and vigilantly standing in touch with regulatory and technological shifts can provide investors with more confidence and resilience in navigating the crypto landscape.

WBTC thief returns $71 million worth of stolen funds

$71 million worth of stolen cryptocurrencies from a recent wallet poisoning scam has been returned to the victim in a fortunate but mysterious turn of events.The unknown attacker returned $71 million worth of Ether (ETH) tokens on May 12, after the high-profile phishing incident caught the attention of multiple blockchain investigation firms. On-chain security firm Lookonchain unpacked the details in an X post on May 13:“SlowMist_Team released a report on this incident 3 days ago, tracking multiple attacker’ IPs possibly from Hong Kong (the use of VPNs has not been ruled out). After that, the attacker replied to the whale and returned all the funds.”Source: LookonchainThis comes as a surprising development to the attack from May 3, when an investor sent $71 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) to a bait wallet address, falling victim to a wallet poisoning scam. The scammer created a wallet address with similar alphanumeric characters and made a small transaction to the victim’s account.Related: El Salvador launches $360M Bitcoin treasury monitoring websiteLike most investors, the victim validated the wallet address by matching the first and last few characters and transferred 97% of their assets to it. However, the difference would have been noticeable in the middle characters, often hidden on platforms to improve visual appeal.White hat hacker, good samaritan, or scared thief?Despite returning all the stolen funds, on-chain transactions leading up to the event suggest this was not the exploiter’s initial intention.After receiving the stolen funds, the attacker immediately converted the 1,155 WBTC to approximately 23,000 ETH — a popular move by malicious hackers that can help launder stolen funds via privacy protocols and crypto mixing services such as Tornado Cash.On May 8, the attacker started spreading the funds across over 400 crypto wallets, which ultimately ended up in over 150 separate wallets, before returning the assets.Source: PeckshieldThe return of the funds came shortly after on-chain security firm SlowMist published an analysis on the attacker’s potential Hong Kong-based IPs, suggesting that the thief got scarred by the potential consequences.Source: SlowMistThe $71 million theft is only a small part of the phishing attempts associated with the WBTC tief, according to a May 10 incident report by SlowMist:“Upon investigating this fee address, we observed that from April 19 to May 3, this address initiated over 20,000 small transactions, distributing small amounts of ETH to various addresses for phishing purposes.”The amount of crypto stolen from hacks and scams fell to $25.7 million in April, markings the lowest historical figure since 2021 when on-chain intelligence firm CertiK started tracking the data.Related: Ether turns inflationary for the first time since the Merge

Tether Defends Transparency Amid Ripple Critics


In a striking development, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino publicly challenged Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse following comments about potential SEC scrutiny of USDT. 
This confrontation underscores the regulatory complexities facing stablecoin issuers and the intense competition within the cryptocurrency sector.
Tether CEO Confronts Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse Over FUD
Paolo Ardoino responded to Garlinghouse’s comments by taking to social media. He accused people of spreading “fear, uncertainty, and doubt” (FUD), particularly as Ripple prepares to enter the stablecoin market.
At a pivotal moment, Tether, the issuer of the world’s most utilized stablecoin, USDT, stands. With a user base mainly in emerging markets and developing countries, USDT is a crucial financial resource, offering access to financial services from which many are otherwise excluded. 

Amid these accusations, Brad Garlinghouse aired his concerns on the “World Class” podcast with Chris Vasquez. He discussed the severe implications for the broader crypto market if the U.S. government were to act against Tether, emphasizing Tether’s critical role.

In response to the FUD accusation, Tether reiterated its dedication to compliance and transparency. The company complies with regulatory standards and collaborates with global law enforcement to block and report illicit transactions. These efforts ensure the safety and stability of Tether’s operations. They block over $1.3 billion tied to scams, hacks, and money laundering, as Ardoino highlighted.

“The real facts show how Tether USDt, leveraging the transparency of the blockchain technology and working with global law enforcement is able to comply with requirements,” he said.

Moreover, Tether supports a highly skilled internal investigation team. Ardoino noted that this team uses advanced tools to monitor both primary and secondary market transactions. Their work is enhanced through partnerships with analytics firms like Chainalysis, which supply cutting-edge software to bolster monitoring and compliance.
This dispute not only points to the SEC’s potential actions but also to the competitive dynamics in the cryptocurrency industry, where the launch of new stablecoins by companies like Ripple could alter market dynamics and regulatory focus. As Ripple gears up to introduce its stablecoin, the stakes are considerable, putting Garlinghouse’s actions and words under intense scrutiny.
As the cryptocurrency sector evolves, the interaction among competition, regulatory challenges, and market stability grows increasingly complex. Tether and Ripple must navigate these waters carefully, balancing aggressive business tactics with strict compliance and ethical standards.

                        El Salvador, renowned for its move to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021, has now introduced a cutting-edge online platform for tracking the country’s Bitcoin Treasury.The initiative, spearheaded by The Bitcoin Office, a Salvadoran government agency dedicated to overseeing Bitcoin-related projects, aims to offer public access to data on the country’s BTC investments through a specialized mempool.El Salvador Launches Public Platform for Transparency on Bitcoin HoldingsThe official announcement from the Bitcoin Office stated,“EL SALVADOR NOW HAS ITS @MEMPOOL WHERE ANYONE CAN CHECK OUR BITCOIN TREASURY HOLDINGS.”The introduction of this platform signifies a significant step towards enhancing the financial transparency of government operations in El Salvador. The newly launched website, akin to a mempool, offers public access to data regarding El Salvador’s BTC investments.According to the website, the country holds 5,748.76 BTC, valued at over $352.8 million. The platform also reveals that the Salvadoran government acquired an additional 31 BTC in the past month and 7 BTC in the previous week.El Salvador Bitcoin Balance History Source: Bitcoin.gob.svThe recent addition to its BTC reserves aligns with President Nayib Bukele’s visionary strategy, announced in November 2022, in which El Salvador aims to accumulate “1 bitcoin per day.” By actively increasing its Bitcoin reserves, El Salvador continues to position itself as a leader in Bitcoin and blockchain technology.With the launch of this new website, El Salvador continues to lead the way in embracing Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Some proponents speculate that these strategic initiatives could position El Salvador as one of the wealthiest and most innovative nations globally within the next few decades, fueled by Bitcoin adoption.El Salvador’s Bitcoin Experiment: A Steadfast Journey Amidst Volatility
El Salvador made headlines in September 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The move aimed to foster financial inclusion, streamline remittance payments, and promote financial innovation.President Nayib Bukele’s decision faced criticism, particularly after Bitcoin’s price plunged from its all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021. Despite volatility, El Salvador has remained steadfast in its Bitcoin strategy, dollar-cost-averaging into the cryptocurrency since 2021, with an average buying price of $43,097 per BTC.With Bitcoin currently trading above $62,000, El Salvador’s holdings have yielded an unrealized profit exceeding $57.4 million, per the Nayib Bukele Portfolio Tracker website.In a recent commentary, Bukele, who secured reelection in February, has aimed at mainstream media narratives surrounding the government’s economic policies. He criticized the media’s focus on El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings, highlighting the contrast in coverage between periods of low and high Bitcoin market prices.Bukele emphasized the significant increase in Bitcoin’s market value, suggesting that if El Salvador were to sell its holdings now, it would realize a profit of over 40%. He reiterated the government’s stance of holding onto Bitcoin, emphasizing that “1 BTC = 1 BTC” regardless of market fluctuations. Bukele pointed out the silence of media critics who previously highlighted potential losses during lower Bitcoin prices.Despite the attention garnered by El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin, it stands as a singular example among nation-states in adopting a “Bitcoin standard.” While rumors circulate about other countries potentially following suit, no official announcements have been made.However, there are speculations that if Bitcoin reaches $100,000, El Salvador could pay off its loans to the International Monetary Fund, paving the way for financial independence.

Parity Wallet Hacker Launders $9M After Seven Years Hiatus - DailyCoin


        

Parity Wallet hacker has resurfaced after seven years of inactivity.



The hacker has laundered some of the stolen funds.



The attacker’s primary address still holds hundreds of millions in stolen ETH.




The hacker suspected to have stolen tens of thousands of Ethereum from Parity Multisig Wallet has resurfaced after seven years of inactivity.



In July 2017, the attacker exploited a vulnerability on Parity Multisig Wallet version 1.5+ to drain over 150,000 ETH (valued at $30M) from three high-profile multi-signature contracts used to store funds from past token sales.




While blockchain infrastructure platform OpenZeppelin issued a post-mortem of the attack, detailing how it could have been prevented, the stolen funds were never recovered.



Hacker Launders First Batch of Stolen Loot



On May 13, blockchain security firm Cyvers issued an alert on X, noting that the hacker behind the Parity Multisig wallet theft had leveraged multiple consolidated addresses to initiate the laundering of 3,050 ETH ($9 million) at automatic crypto exchange eXch.



“The hacker behind this theft has demonstrated remarkable patience, marking a significant chapter in crypto history. Today, the hacker has initiated the laundering of 3050K ETH,” Cyvers wrote.



Following the first batch transfer, the hacker still retains control of a staggering 83,017 ETH, valued at approximately $246.6 million, Cyvers said, sharing the attacker’s primary address.



While the funds were still intact at the attacker’s primary address as of press time, an anonymous party had left an odd on-chain message, inviting the hacker to provide liquidity for perp DEXs.




“Hey, I am searching for a liquidity provider. I have some hft strategies for perp dexes and amms and can prove it cryptographically, answer with an email or tg if you are interested. If you do so, I will send a signed message (with this address first) and then we can take it from there,” the message read.



The hacker has yet to respond to the message.

Bitcoin Wallets Dormant For Almost 11 Years Just Reawakened, How Much Have They Made? | Bitcoinist.com


								Two Bitcoin whale addresses that had laid dormant for almost 11 years have suddenly sprung to life, taking the market by surprise. The anonymous whale wallets have initiated large-scale Bitcoin transactions, reaping substantial profits from their early investments in the pioneer cryptocurrency. 
Early Bitcoin Whales Move 1,000 BTC
Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain took to X (formerly Twitter) recently to unveil two Satoshi-era whale wallets which have been inert for 10.7 years suddenly showing signs of activity. The on-chain data analysis tool disclosed that the anonymous whale wallets, identified as “16vRqA” and “1DUJuH” had cumulatively transferred a total of 1,000 BTC valued at $60.9 million in the span of 20 minutes. 

According to Lookonchain, the two previously dormant Bitcoin whale wallets had purchased about 500 BTC each as early as September 13, 2013, just four years after the cryptocurrency’s inception. At the time, the price of BTC was about $124, thousands of dollars less than its current price today. 
Each of the BTC whale wallets had previously held 500 BTC, worth approximately $62,000. Now with the price of Bitcoin slightly above $61,200 at the time of the transfer, these anonymous Bitcoin whales have realized significant profits. Over the past 10 years, Bitcoin has skyrocketed by an astonishing 47,873%, resulting in each wallet’s initial BTC investment of $62,000 now yielding a profit of $30,387,372. 
This substantial profit can be attributed to the Bitcoin whale’s long years of hodling the pioneer cryptocurrency. Back in BTC’S early days, when only a fraction of today’s crypto community recognized its potential, a few smart investors had purchased significant amounts of the cryptocurrency at a low price. They held onto their holdings as BTC evolved, witnessing its gradual price increase over the years. 
Following Bitcoin’s rise to a record high of $69,200 in March, another Satoshi-era Bitcoin whale wallet had executed a large-scale BTC transaction, selling off 1,000 BTC and reaping profits of over $69 million. Following the transfer, the price of BTC had fallen significantly, underscoring the strong influence large-scale BTC transactions have on the present market. 
BTC Price Sees Slight Uptick
Following the 1,000 BTC transferred by the two previously inactive whale wallets, Bitcoin’s price, which was initially trading slightly above $60,000, surged by 2.92% in just 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is presently trading at $62,800, displaying bullish signals as its daily price chart depicts mostly green candles.

Bitcoin’s daily trading volume of about $18.1 billion has also witnessed a significant increase of 41.23%, highlighting the sudden rise in interest and demand from investors. It’s presently uncertain if BTC will keep this bullish momentum, considering that the cryptocurrency was previously experiencing substantial declines following the halving event on April 20. 
Over the past month, CoinMarketCap has reported an 8.45% decrease in Bitcoin and another 4.15% drop in the past seven days. With the market showing new signs of interest in BTC, the cryptocurrency’s price correction may be over, indicating the onset of a potential recovery.

Ethereum sees $12M whale transfer: What about ETH's price? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum’s Netflow got more positive.
ETH was close to entering the $3,000 price zone.

Recent data indicates that one of the early Ethereum [ETH] holders has transferred millions of dollars worth of ETH to an exchange. 
While this movement was relatively small, it could contribute to the positive Netflow trend that ETH has been experiencing recently. 
Early Ethereum holder sells most of their holdings
According to data from Spot on Chain, a significant transfer of 4,153 Ethereum coins to Coinbase occurred in the early hours of the 13th of May. 
This transfer, valued at over $12 million at the current ETH price, caught attention because the originating wallet is among the asset’s early holders. 
Further analysis revealed that since 2021, this wallet had deposited over 9,000 ETH—worth more than $21 million—to exchanges. 
As of press time, the wallet retained 2,566 ETH, valued at over $7 million. This recent transfer has contributed to the increased positive Netflow observed in Ethereum transactions.
Ethereum inflow increases 
The Ethereum Netflow chart analysis indicated a notable increase in positive flow over the last three days. However, it appeared poised to be the highest observed in recent days.

Tim Draper leads $3.5 million raise for Bitcoin liquidity protocol Zest - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Tim Draper’s VC firm Draper Associates led the $3.5 million seed round for Zest Protocol.
Binance Labs, Trust Machines and Bitcoin Frontier Fund among key participants.

Billionaire Tim Draper has led a $3.5 million seed round investment in the on-chain Bitcoin lending platform Zest Protocol.
Other than the billionaire’s venture capital firm Draper Associates, the round also attracted the participation of Binance Labs, Trust Machines and Flow Traders. 
Bitcoin Frontier Fund, Gravity Fund, Primal Capital, Hyperithm, Miton Crypto, Tykhe Block Ventures, Elixir Capital also participated.
Per details published in a blog post on Monday, Zest will use the funds to expand its decentralised, peer-to-peer lending business.
On the platform, users can lend their Bitcoin (BTC) or borrow against it. With this, users have an opportunity to generate yield or passive income without having to sell their Bitcoin.
Growing the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem
To bring the product to the community, Zest Protocol has tapped into Bitcoin layer 2 network Stacks. The project leverages Stacks’ Nakamoto upgrade to allow for asset bridging asset, unlocking access to DeFi on Bitcoin.
Tycho Onnasch, founder of Zest Protocol, commented:
“Unlike on Ethereum, the creation of basic DeFi primitives such as liquidity pools isn’t possible on Bitcoin L1. The Stacks sBTC upgrade is set to be a watershed moment for Bitcoin DeFi, which is what it was designed for from the beginning.”
Users with sBTC can fund their Zest Protocol balances with sBTC to gain access to lending or other yield-generating features.

No, Hong Kong's Crypto ETFs Aren't Available in Mainland China

Adding some fuel to the fire was a piece in the SCMP that said these ETFs would be available to mainland traders who have Hong Kong residency and brokerage accounts. That’s certainly true, but there’s a massive caveat: it's like saying that mainlanders with U.S. residency can open an American brokerage account and trade New York-listed stocks (which they can’t). This doesn't mean that they are available in mainland China, as the trading, by mainlanders with Hong Kong residency, is done in Hong Kong.

Degen Chain Halts Block Production: What's Next for DEGEN Token?


							

Degen Chain’s halt in block production for over 11 hours raises concerns about its operational stability.



Despite the setback, DEGEN token has shown resilience in its market performance, with a 3.69% increase in the past 24 hours.



Technical indicators like RSI and MACD suggest a neutral to bullish sentiment for DEGEN, indicating a potential price recovery.




Wu Blockchain, a crypto news reporter, brought to light that the L3 blockchain Degen Chain has halted block production for more than 11 hours, with the reason behind it still undisclosed. Degen Chain, developed by Syndicate and formerly supported by a16z, operates on Arbitrum Orbit. Degen Chain’s Gas token, DEGEN, serves as the principal currency of Farcaster.







Despite the fallout, the DEGEN token’s market performance remains resilient. DEGEN’s current price is $0.018955, and its 24-hour trading volume exceeds $26 million. This is a 3.69% growth in the last 24 hours. Concurrently, it has fallen 13.61% in the previous seven days. 



Moreover, its market cap stands at $268.77 million, backed by a circulating supply of over 14 billion coins. Investors are closely monitoring the situation, as Degen Chain’s status directly influences DEGEN’s market dynamics.



Analyzing DEGEN’s technical indicators provides insights into its current market sentiment and potential future trends. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour price chart sits at 51.86, signaling a neutral stance among traders.

However, the KST indicator, at 8.1201, indicates that additional investigation is required to determine the stock’s performance trajectory. In addition, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator signals a positive trend reversal, providing traders with optimism in the face of uncertainty.



Delving deeper into the price action, DEGEN experienced a volatile start. Witnessing a sharp decline early in the morning, it bottomed out around 7:30 AM. However, the token staged a remarkable recovery after that, steadily climbing for several hours. 



Around 9:00 AM, the pace of recovery accelerated, propelling DEGEN to surpass its initial price, reaching a peak of $0.019 before 11:00 AM. Following the peak, a minor correction ensued, though the price remained significantly higher than both its starting point and the day’s low.

MakerDAO and Aave’s DeFi conflict reopens over DAI’s perceived risk growth

The once-symbiotic relationship between decentralized stablecoin issuer MakerDAO and lending protocol Aave is fraying. As new innovations are being tested within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, tension has started building up. The perceived risk of these innovations puts the two major protocols at a crossroads. At the center of the controversy is a controversial stablecoin mirroring what’s known as a “basis trade” and Maker’s Direct Deposit Dai Module (D3M), Ethena’s USDe.MakerDAO launched its Dai (DAI) token in 2017 as an overcollateralized decentralized stablecoin backed by Ether (ETH). Users had to mint tokens on the MakerDAO platform by locking up ETH. In November 2019, Maker launched multicollateral DAI, allowing DAI to be backed by multiple cryptocurrencies, including centralized stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC).Aave (formerly known as ETHLend) launched around the same time as a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency lending platform and integrated DAI as collateral on its platform from an early stage. Both platforms collaborated throughout the 2021 DeFi boom. The launch of D3M, in cooperation with Aave, allowed Maker to directly interact with its secondary market by actively enforcing a maximum variable borrow rate.Things took a turn during the 2022 bear market as the collapse of then-major DeFi protocols and major cryptocurrency lending firms, as well as the banking crisis that led to the collapse of Credit Suisse, put unprecedented pressure on these protocols.Alarm bells ring as stablecoins depeg The 2022 bear market was marked by a series of bankruptcies and high-profile collapses, starting with the Terra ecosystem in May. Terra collapsed after its algorithmic stablecoin lost its peg.The collapse saw Terra (LUNA), previously a top 10 cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of over $40 billion, become nearly worthless in days as it entered a “death spiral” that led to the minting of trillions of tokens.The collapse of the Terra ecosystem had cascading effects that ultimately led to the collapse of lending platforms Celsius and BlockFi, among others. As a result, MakerDAO voted to temporarily cut off Aave’s D3M in a bid to protect itself.The bear market later saw the centralized stablecoin USDC briefly lose its peg after the now-defunct Silicon Valley Bank collapsed with $3.3 billion of the stablecoin’s reserves held there. The peg was restored only after regulators stepped in to ensure that depositors were made whole.That depeg rang alarm bells for MakerDAO, which shortly after requested an “urgent executive proposal to mitigate risks to the protocol” to address its then over $3.1 billion exposure to USDC. At the time, Maker also moved to eliminate its exposure to Aave, stating its “overall risk-reward of depositing funds into the D3M are not favorable under current conditions.”Speaking to Cointelegraph, Becky Sarwate, head of communications at cryptocurrency exchange Cex.io, said that the decentralized autonomous organization’s (DAO) next move was then to purchase real-world assets in the form of U.S. Treasurys to “strengthen market confidence in DAI by bringing the network’s value composition into greater harmony.”Recent: Despite Bitcoin price volatility, factors point to BTC’s long-term successIndeed, real-world assets, including U.S. Treasurys and short-term loans, currently represent a large portion of DAI’s backing, making up 20% of all generated stability fees in March.According to Sarwate, the protocol has since moved to extend its credit back into stablecoins. This decision has worried some market participants, especially given its new exposure to what some deem a risky stablecoin mirroring a hedge fund trade.Tensions rise between MakerDAO and AaveMakerDAO and Aave became more direct competitors over time. In early 2023, MakerDAO introduced Spark Protocol, a fork of Aave’s version 3 that allows users to borrow, lend and stake DAI directly. This fork is linked to Maker’s D3M, effectively offering DAI users an Aave competitor.Later that year, Aave launched GHO, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. It described it as a “decentralized, overcollateralized” asset backed by a “multitude” of digital assets, including Ether — effectively making GHO a competitor to DAI.Market data suggests neither platform was successful enough to threaten its competitor. Spark Protocol currently has around $2.4 billion in total value locked, down from a peak of over $4 billion, while Aave has over $10.6 billion locked on its smart contracts across 12 chains.On the other hand, DAI’s circulating supply is over $5 billion, dwarfing GHO’s near $50 million.The tension between these two protocols surged in early April 2024 after AaveDAO debated limiting the amount of MakerDAO’s DAI stablecoin allowed as collateral on its lending platform, potentially completely removing it.While the case was ultimately settled with a loan-to-value reduction of 12%, Aave Chain initiative founder Marc Zeller had proposed to altogether remove DAI as collateral on Aave, which now stands as decentralized finance’s leading lending platform with over $10 billion in total value locked.The smaller-than-expected reduction came after a detailed analysis from Chaos Labs called for a more conservative approach. Cex.io’s Sarwate says:“In many ways, Aave was put in a very difficult position, as on the one hand MakerDAO extended DAI’s line of credit from 100 million to a possible short-term ceiling of 1 billion tokens, which introduces significant risk.”She added that this risk was compounded by the organization’s decision to put some of the newly minted DAI into Ethena’s synthetic dollar USDe. This algorithmic stablecoin has sparked skepticism in the market as it aims to replicate a common hedge fund strategy.Boiling pointMakerDAO’s indirect exposure to USDe, coupled with the extended line of credit, was seemingly a boiling point for the Aave community, with the stablecoin being particularly controversial.Ethena’s USDe essentially takes advantage of price differences between spot and futures markets to generate yield through what’s known as the cash-and-carry trade. It works with a Staked Ether (stETH) position and a corresponding short position on ETH, hedging that exposure to the cryptocurrency.The trade is essentially market neutral and generates yield through the staked ETH and the funding rates perpetual futures contracts charge traders with open positions. This helps align the perpetual futures contract’s price with the underlying cryptocurrency’s spot price.When there’s more buying demand, the funding rate is positive, and those with long positions pay short sellers, while when supply outstrips demand, the opposite happens. Since Ethena’s launch, funding rates have mostly been positive, allowing USDe holders to earn double-digit yields through what has been a “delta neutral” trade.Critics, however, have argued that the stablecoin can become under-collateralized during a cryptocurrency bear market in which the price of perpetual ETH futures contracts drops below the spot price of ETH, which would turn funding rates against USDe holders.The founder of decentralized finance protocol Yearn.finance, Andre Cronje, has suggested on social media that things are now going well and funding rates are positive, but he added that “eventually that turns, funding becomes negative, margin/collateral gets liquidated, and you have an unbacked asset.”Cronje noted other risks, including external risks related to the oracle used to keep stETH pegged to ETH, exchange custody risks and potential spread risks. Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO of cryptocurrency market maker Wintermute, mentioned on social media platform X that key risks were related to execution and custody.Sarwate said, “If USDe were to go into freefall, it could push DAI toward a similar tipping point.” She added: “On the other hand, Aave choosing to remove DAI completely could run the risk of exacerbating such potential underlying conditions. When not approached thoughtfully, delistings can be turbulent and fracture communities that once enjoyed a freer range of motion.”John Lo, a former key contributor at popular decentralized exchange SushiSwap and now head of digital assets at cryptocurrency fund Recharge Capital, told Cointelegraph that Aave’s move to reduce the loan-to-value ratio was prudent but noted that “removing DAI as collateral completely would be extreme.”Lo called for more research on the limits of the D3M module and “its ability to be utilized as a flash loan vector — as rapidly inflating the price on any oracles poses a risk to all lending protocols.” Flash loans are loans taken and repaid within a single transaction.He said the risk of flash loans being used to manipulate oracles to mint more tokens should always be evaluated. The minting of tokens — as mentioned above — was part of Terra’s death spiral.The ghost of stablecoin’s pastOn Aave’s proposal to drop the loan-to-value for DAI, Aave Chan founder Mark Zeller references the Aave protocol’s “previous experience” with the “consequences of reckless minting policies” on a smaller scale, such as that of Angle’s agEUR, a stablecoin pegged to the euro minted into Euler that was hacked within a week.Lo said Ethena’s USDe stablecoin is “centralized, and therefore, there exists a slight security risk in the ability to mint more USDe at will,” a risk that could be “potentially offset by USDe’s reputational constraints.” He added that the most important risk was cascading liquidations and slippage incurred from growing redemptions in a bank run scenario.He explained that runaway redemptions during low or negative funding rates “would force exists from short perpetual future positions,” and slippage could be incurred “at size if ETH and BTC prices are increasing during that time.” On top of that, Lo added that slippage incurred on selling staked ETH over low liquidity should also be considered, as even a 5% decrease in a stablecoin’s net asset value “is enough to trigger a crisis in confidence.”Cex.io’s Sarwate commented that to some in the cryptocurrency space, “USDe’s yield structure raises specters of stablecoin’s past” and pointed out that USDe’s popularity is but one of the factors at play“This is leading some critics to recall the old adage about the downstream effects of burning twice as bright should the network’s delicate balance start to wobble. While high returns can be cause for excitement, negative effects could domino across all vested chains if conditions on the core asset falter,” she added.Lo, on the other hand, revealed he doesn’t believe USDe poses “unique risks to DeFi,” as it is a “size-constrained tokenized delta neutral strategy that has been commonly deployed by funds.”According to Lo, various similar tokenized projects should start appearing in the future, and a larger question to ask is whether USDe itself will continue to be attractive for users once perpetual funding rates fall and potentially turn negative, which could affect USDe’s on-chain liquidity. “Many tokens and stablecoin have low liquidity on-chain, and the risk that arises in that scenario is economic exploits, in particular, oracle price manipulation as a result; however, I don’t believe these would cause systemic risks in the way Luna and its UST mechanism functioned,” he said.Nevertheless, the former SushiSwap contributor saw a silver lining in the rising tensions between both protocols and the controversy surrounding USDe, noting that the discussions and attention on these issues are getting “shows governance at DAI is alive and well and most importantly widely known.”Recent: Blockchain adoption in healthcare faces serious obstacles in GermanyTo him, this activity should be seen as the “number one signal of confidence in a decentralized protocol,” and while mitigations will ultimately be implemented, one can ask how much in governance “is related to security and how much is to prevent competition for established incumbents.”What’s “generally lacking in crypto,” he said, are “consolidated independent reviews of collateral risks and asset risk,” something he believes the ecosystem would greatly benefit from.MakerDAO and Aave’s latest spat was seemingly resolved with Chaos Labs’ analysis of DAI for the Aave DAO, leading to the 12% loan-to-value reduction. On social media, Zeller concluded the matter with a simple “DAI stays in Aave, we move on. Onwards.”Whether Ethena’s USDe will ultimately collapse, fall behind competition or suffer some other fate is unclear, but with the presence of Spark Protocol and Aave’s GHO, what is likely is that these two protocols will eventually bump into each other down the road again.

Bitcoin Up 3%: What Will Inflation Data And Powell Speech Bring This Week? - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD is carefully maintaining the $60,000 support level, navigating a delicate balance between bullish optimism and bearish caution.What Happened: This week, as traditional financial sessions commence, Bitcoin remains anchored in a familiar range, yet poised for potential volatility influenced by impending U.S. macroeconomic data and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.Market analysts are closely monitoring Bitcoin's performance, particularly the stability around the $60,000 mark, which has been sustained since early May. Mark Cullen, a noted analyst, emphasized the significance of this level, stating, “Bitcoin still holding above 60k and the down trend break. That blue OB is going to be the key in the short term, lose it & we revisit the lows & likely much lower. Hold and another leg to take liquidity above the highs at 64-67k is likely.”This precarious balance comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market could be influenced by several macroeconomic triggers. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on May 14 is anticipated to be a critical indicator for Bitcoin's immediate financial trajectory. “If CPI inflation rises again this week, it will mark the third STRAIGHT monthly increase,” noted The Kobeissi Letter in a post, underscoring a bustling week ahead.Further adding to the intrigue, Powell is scheduled to speak on economic issues in Amsterdam, which could provide further cues to the market. Cryptocurrency markets have historically shown heightened sensitivity to Powell’s tone, particularly as it relates to future policy directions.Simultaneously, seasoned Bitcoin holders are demonstrating patterns reminiscent of the 2021 bull market, choosing to increase their holdings amid lower prices, potentially to capitalize on future market highs.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $62,897, up 3% over the past 24 hours.Also Read: How Much Did Donald Trump’s Crypto Portfolio Pump After He Said He’s ‘Fine With It’?Why It Matters: This cyclical behavior underscores a broader trend of growing long-term holder influence over Bitcoin’s available supply, which could have long-term implications for the market’s structure.In the derivatives markets, neutrality prevails with funding rates remaining balanced, suggesting that the market is in a state of watchful waiting.

Digital Asset Investment Products Witness Inflows After 5 Weeks Of Decline - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Digital asset investment products break a five-week streak of outflows, attracting $130 million globally.



Despite the influx, ETP volumes declined to $8 billion, notably in the US, where Grayscale sees its lowest outflows since January.



Bitcoin sees a resurgence with $144 million in inflows, but Ethereum faces uncertainty as US regulators’ lack of action on spot Ethereum ETFs sparks speculation.




In a notable turn of events, digital asset investment products have recorded inflows for the first time in five weeks, amassing a total of $130 million. 





Digital Asset Investment Products Break Outflow Trend



However, despite this positive uptick, Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) volumes continued their descent, with a weekly figure of $8 billion, notably lower than April’s average ofS$17 billion. This decline underscores a waning participation of ETP investors in the crypto ecosystem, constituting only 22% of total volumes on global trusted exchanges, down from 31% the previous month.



The United States emerged as a key player in digital asset investment products, witnessing the lion’s share of inflows at $135 million. Notably, Grayscale, a prominent incumbent, experienced its lowest weekly outflows since January, amounting to $171 million. Meanwhile, Switzerland saw inflows totaling $14 million.



Contrary to previous weeks, Hong Kong experienced a significant drop in inflows, with just $19 million recorded, signaling that the surge in inflows following the launch of Bitcoin ETFs may have been largely driven by seed capital. On the other hand, Canada and Germany continued to grapple with outflows, totaling $20 million and $15 million, respectively, bringing their year-to-date outflows to a combined $660 million.




Bitcoin Resurgence Amid Ethereum Uncertainty



Bitcoin itself saw an encouraging influx of $144 million, reclaiming lost ground from what had been a lackluster month. Conversely, short-Bitcoin ETPs witnessed outflows totaling $5.1 million, continuing a trend of outflows over the past 8 weeks amounting to $18 million.



Moreover, the subdued response from US regulators regarding spot Ethereum ETF applications has fueled speculation about delayed approvals, potentially contributing to Ethereum-related outflows totaling $14 million last week.

El Salvador Bitcoin Tracker Spearheads Govt Transparency - DailyCoin


        El Salvador stunned the world in 2021 by becoming the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender. This decision exposed President Nayib Bukele to criticism from economists, global institutions, and political opponents. Despite the backlash, Bukele continues to double down on making his country a beacon for Bitcoin adoption.
The Central American country has amassed a sovereign Bitcoin reserve of around 6,000 BTC through direct buys, mining revenue, and its residency program. To boost transparency around these holdings, the government recently launched an on-chain tracker documenting the wallet flows.Opting for Bitcoin TransparencyEl Salvador, in conjunction with Mempool, has launched an on-chain tracker showing real-time visibility into the nation’s Bitcoin holdings. The details show El Salvador is currently holding 5,749 BTC, valued at around $362.8 million based on the price at the time of writing.The most recent transactions consist of daily purchases of 1 BTC, in line with Bukele’s pledge to buy one Bitcoin every day from November 18, 2022. According to nayibtracker.com, El Salvador’s dollar cost average buy price is $43,098 per coin, equating to an unrealized profit of $114.8 million.The recent upturn in Bitcoin’s price in the run-up to the approval of US spot Bitcoin ETFs pushed El Salvador’s Bitcoin investment into profitable territory. This was met with an impassioned celebration from Bukele, who clapped back at critics who had slammed his radical approach to government.
Bukele’s unorthodox governing style has been highly polarizing, particularly regarding the country’s crackdown on suspected gang members and what this means for human rights in El Salvador. However, Bukele has also earned plaudits from those who believe other governments worldwide should take cues from his playbook, especially on Bitcoin and publicly tracking holdings.El Salvador Leading the WayIn support of El Salvador’s move to publicly track Bitcoin holdings, the Lightning Network X account stated, “One day residents of every country will demand full financial transparency of their governments.” With billions being sent to Ukraine and Israel, when many are suffering economic hardship at home, the issue of government overspending and the lack of transparency around public spending has become a political hot potato.Commenting on this, Being Libertarian warned that things will not improve domestically until the funding of conflicts stops. Being Libertarian called for an audit of the Fed and for followers to support politicians who “get this.”Meanwhile, in response to the arrest of El Salvdaor’s presidential commissioner for strategic projects over bribery allegations, Bukele declared that his entire executive branch would be investigated for corruption. Bukele stated, “I want to be remembered as the President who didn’t steal and didn’t let anyone else steal either.”On the Flipside
Bitcoin adoption among everyday Salvadorians is low, mainly due to fear of losing value on downside moves.



El Salvador’s unrealized BTC gains can potentially disappear overnight.



The exception stock trading performance of some US politicians has become a meme at this point.
Why This MattersBy voluntarily exposing its Bitcoin holdings to public scrutiny, El Salvador is pioneering a new frontier of financial transparency and accountability that is lacking in governments worldwide. This sets a refreshing precedent in an era marred by widespread financial corruption.El Salvador attempts to lure highly skilled workers with citizenship offer.Bitcoin Pioneer El Salvador Is Offering 5,000 Free PassportsCongressman Emmer supports bills for SEC reform.SEC’s Gensler Under Fire as Emmer Launches Crypto Defense

Japanese Cryptocurrency Company Announces That It Accepts Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Metaplanet, a major crypto investment and advisory firm operating in Tokyo, has made a strategic decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, marking a significant move amid the economic challenges facing Japan.
Japan's Metaplanet Accepts Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Amid Yen Declining Environment
In an announcement on Monday, the company cited Japan's ongoing economic woes, including high government debt levels, prolonged periods of negative real interest rates and the resulting weakness of the Yen, as the primary motivation for Bitcoin adoption.


Japan, which has the highest government debt/GDP ratio among developed countries at 254.6%, is currently grappling with significant economic challenges, as reported by the International Monetary Fund.
Despite the government's efforts to address economic woes, including its decision to raise interest rates in March, the Yen has fallen to its lowest level in 34 years, according to Reuters.






Explaining its rationale, Metaplanet emphasized Bitcoin's role as a “non-sovereign store of value” that is resilient to fiat currencies.
The company emphasized Bitcoin's distinct monetary policy, which is immutable and finite, with its maximum supply capped at 21 million coins, unlike traditional fiat currencies and other cryptocurrencies subject to central control.


“Bitcoin's monetary policy is rigidly set in stone until 2140, distinguishing it from both monetary metals and rival crypto projects operated at the whims of centralized developer teams,” Metaplanet said.
Additionally, the company has taken a strategic approach to asset management, revealing its intention to leverage the “full spectrum” of capital markets instruments to strengthen its Bitcoin reserves.





According to data from Bitcointreasuries.net, as of May 10, Metaplanet reportedly held 117.7 BTC, which is equivalent to approximately $7.2 million.

Solana (SOL) Skyrockets 1,966% in Fund Flows: Is Solana ETF Possibility?


As became known, Solana (SOL) has experienced an unprecedented surge of 1,966% in fund inflows in the past week, firmly establishing itself as a standout leader in alternative cryptocurrency-focused investment products over the past week. According to the latest report from CoinShares, a substantial $5.9 million was directed toward SOL-related products within this short time frame. This surge not only reaffirms SOL's dominance but also marks a nearly twenty-fold increase in inflows into Solana ETPs, totaling an impressive $17 million since the beginning of the year.Contrary to this notable uptrend in SOL, the broader market landscape paints a different picture. While investment products for digital assets witnessed a commendable $130 million inflow, volumes for ETPs experienced a significant decline, dropping from April's $17 billion to $8 billion. Source: CoinSharesThis trend suggests a diminishing involvement of ETP investors in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, now constituting only 22% of the total volume on global reputable exchanges.When Solana ETF?Amid growing interest from traditional investors in SOL, speculation arises regarding the feasibility of a Solana ETF. However, the potential for such an ETF is closely tied to the fate of the Ethereum ETF. With it facing regulatory obstacles, the path to a Solana ETF appears equally challenging. Notably, regulatory ambiguity surrounds Ethereum ETF status, with the SEC's classification of SOL as an unregistered security in last year's case against the Kraken exchange adding to the uncertainty.As investors await clarity on the ETF front, the prospect of a Solana ETF remains speculative, contingent upon regulatory developments and the resolution of Ethereum's ETF dilemma.

Europe's Crypto Rise: Insights from CME Group's Payal Shah | Cryptoglobe


                                
Payal Shah from CME Group highlights the significant role European investors play in the global cryptocurrency landscape. Europe, comprising Central, Northern, and Western regions, now stands as the world’s second-largest crypto economy, trailing only North America. 



Payal Shah is a key figure at CME Group where she serves as the Director of Equity and Cryptocurrency Product Development. She is deeply involved in leading the creation of innovative products across various markets, including crypto, equity, and alternative investments. 



In a recent opinion piece published in The Wall Stree Journal (WSJ), Shah points out that from July 2022 to June 2023, Europe was responsible for 17.6% of the global cryptocurrency transactions as detailed in Chainalysis’s 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report.



Shah suggests that Europe’s enhanced position in the crypto sphere is primarily due to the stringent regulatory climates in Asia and the ongoing regulatory hurdles in the U.S., which have indirectly favored the European markets. She explains that the eurozone’s relatively lenient regulatory environment makes it a conducive hub for crypto-related activities, noting the euro’s status as the second most traded fiat currency in crypto transactions after the U.S. dollar. According to Shah, the shift of trading volumes from Asia, particularly after stringent bans in places like China, has benefited the European markets.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Shah emphasizes that for institutional adoption of assets, ample liquidity is essential, and European markets are well-positioned in this regard. She observes that European institutions have broad access to diverse crypto financial instruments such as ETFs, ETNs, and a variety of derivatives, bolstered by strong support from European exchanges that have expanded through substantial funding and global outreach.



Moreover, Shah points out that decentralized finance (DeFi) has become particularly attractive in Europe, where it represents the majority of the cryptocurrency value received. She describes how, in a low to negative interest rate environment, European institutions are increasingly drawn to DeFi platforms as viable alternatives for securing better yields, leveraging the technological advances that DeFi offers.



Finally, Shah comments on the technological proficiency of European financial institutions, which she believes have historically prioritized IT infrastructure more than their U.S. counterparts. This technological edge, Shah notes, has accelerated the adoption of blockchain and crypto technologies within the European financial sector. She adds that numerous European banks and exchanges are actively exploring both centralized and decentralized blockchain applications, anticipating a blend of traditional and digital asset trading in the near future.



In her closing remarks, Shah underscores that as the eurozone’s economy progresses, the importance of tailored risk management tools, such as CME Group’s euro-denominated futures contracts for Bitcoin and Ether, will grow, highlighting these tools’ roles in managing exposure to cryptocurrencies and strengthening Europe’s stance as a dominant force in the global crypto market.

What is phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) and how to defend against it?

                            Phishing and phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS), explained                                        Phishing is a prevalent hack that aims to trick people into disclosing private information, including credit card numbers, passwords and personal identities. A staggering 300,497 phishing cases were reported to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2022 alone. These attacks resulted in victims losing over $52 million. Usually, it entails sending phony emails that seem authentic, duping recipients into opening harmful links or requesting sensitive information. Phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) is an alarming development in the world of cybercrime. With the use of a subscription-based web service called PhaaS, even non-technical criminals may easily execute complex phishing attacks. These firms offer pre-made phishing kits, editable templates and server infrastructure to create fake web pages.A cybercriminal may, for instance, sign up for a PhaaS platform, create an email template that seems like it comes from a respectable crypto exchange, and distribute it to thousands of possible recipients. A link to a fake login page intended to steal users’ credentials might be included in the email. Cybercriminals may swiftly launch extensive phishing campaigns with PhaaS, posing a greater threat to both individuals and enterprises. The accessibility of PhaaS reduces the entrance barrier for cybercrime, which is a major worry for internet consumers and cybersecurity experts globally.                                                                    How PhaaS works                                        PhaaS makes it easier for fraudsters to start phishing attacks by giving them access to extensive toolkits and infrastructure. It operates as follows:PhaaS kitsPre-packaged phishing kits with all the tools, infrastructure and templates needed to carry out phishing attacks are available from PhaaS suppliers. Email templates, fictitious login pages, domain registration services and hosting infrastructure are all included in these kits.CustomizationThe degree of customization offered by various PhaaS systems varies. Phishing emails, websites and domains may all be altered by con artists to look genuine and trustworthy. Phishing campaigns can be customized to target particular people, businesses or sectors.TargetingPhishing attacks made possible by PhaaS are getting more complex. Cybercriminals have the ability to design highly targeted advertising campaigns that imitate the branding and communication strategies of reputable companies and their offerings. Attackers can create persuasive communications that have a higher chance of tricking recipients by utilizing personal information gleaned from social media, data breaches and other sources.For instance, attackers often pose as support staff from popular wallets, exchanges or projects on social media (Telegram, Discord, Twitter, etc.). They offer help and trick users via false claims of giveaways or airdrops into giving up private keys or seed phrases or establishing connections with compromised wallets to siphon off their funds.                                                                    Dangers of PhaaS                                        PhaaS has dramatically reduced the entry barrier for hackers, which has resulted in a discernible rise in the quantity and sophistication of phishing attempts.Even those with no technical experience can simply launch complex phishing attacks with PhaaS using pre-packaged toolkits, customizable templates and the hosting infrastructure offered by PhaaS providers.The possibility of suffering a large financial loss is the main risk associated with PhaaS. The goal of phishing scams is to obtain users’ private keys, seed phrases or login credentials. These can be used to access their accounts and drain their cryptocurrency wallets for nefarious purposes. For instance, attackers altered BadgerDAO’s front-end in 2021 after fooling users into providing permissions that let their money be drained.PhaaS attacks have the potential to undermine confidence in the crypto community. Scams that are successful can discourage people from using even reputable projects and services, which prevents widespread adoption. These attacks are especially vulnerable to novice cryptocurrency users. They can be more susceptible to falling for social media impersonations or websites that look authentic because they lack experience.Phishing attacks are getting more and more complex; they frequently use social engineering strategies and imitate genuine platforms. This makes it challenging for even experienced users to recognize. PhaaS is not just for large-scale email campaigns. Spear-phishing attacks are directed at well-known people or companies in the cryptocurrency industry. Such attacks use personalized information to trick specific individuals or organizations into giving up sensitive data or taking actions that lead to financial loss or security breaches.                                                                    How to defend against PhaaS                                        An ideal way to protect against PhaaS is to practice constant vigilance: Double-check everything (URLs, sender addresses), never click unsolicited links, and never share your private keys or seed phrases.Multilayered security approach and technical defensesInstall firewalls, network monitoring tools, endpoint security and robust email filtering. These technological safeguards aid in the identification and blocking of risky attachments, phishing emails and questionable network activity.User awareness trainingTeach staff members on a regular basis how to spot and report phishing attempts. Inform them of the typical signs of phishing attempts. This entails instructing people to examine sender addresses closely, determine the urgency of messages, stay away from dubious links, and desist from sending private information over email.Security policiesImplement security measures like best practices for passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA). To avoid unwanted access, encourage the use of strong, unique passwords that are updated on a regular basis.DMARC implementationTo assist in removing spoof emails, make use of email authentication methods such as domain-based message authentication, reporting and conformance (DMARC). By assisting in email authenticity verification, DMARC lowers the success rate of phishing attempts.It gives domain owners insights into email authentication statistics on their domain and lets them set policies to handle unauthenticated emails.Threat intelligenceSign up for threat intelligence services to receive information on the newest phishing attacks and PhaaS techniques. To better defend cryptocurrency platforms against evolving cyberthreats, keep up with new developments in the field of cyberattacks and emerging online risks.

Changpeng Zhao has 'nothing else to do' during jail time so may write a book


Jailed former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao says he may use his upcoming four months of ‘quiet time’ to write a book on his tenure as the leader of the world’s biggest crypto exchange.
Zhao tweeted on Sunday that he’s considering embarking on a literary career after a Binance supporter said they were “Waiting for the CZ book, the book for crypto upcoming leaders.”
“I got some ‘quiet time’ coming up. Will use that to write something,” the disgraced exchange boss replied.

Zhao received a four-month prison sentence last month after pleading guilty in the US to several charges of violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Prosecutors recommended he receive a three-year sentence while Zhao’s defense pushed for zero jail time.  
In response to another user, Zhao said that he’s “Got nothing else to do.” Indeed, it appears that Zhao will need to find something to occupy the entire four months as, due to sentencing laws, he’ll likely be required to serve his entire sentence.
Three Arrows Capital co-founder Su Zhu also received four months in prison after he tried to flee the country, violating a court order. He described his time in jail as an ‘enjoyable experience overall’ and said “I think it’s definitely good for you.“

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also received a relatively small sentence of just six months house arrest after failing to implement anti-money laundering protocols in the operation of his exchange. FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried, on the other hand, received a far heftier 25-year prison sentence for his high-profile crimes.  
During his prison stay, Zhao will also have time to work on his ‘Giggle Academy,’ a recently-announced ‘platform for online education for underprivileged kids.’

CEO Seat Changed in Popular Altcoin, Was the Price Affected? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Antonio Juliano, founder of decentralized cryptocurrency exchange dYdX, announced that he has resigned as CEO of the parent company.
Stating that he has resigned as dYdX CEO in a blog post, Antonio Juliano stated that he will continue to be president of dYdX Trading.



“I will always be the leader of dYdX. I have no idea what will happen next for me.
We have achieved a lot, but we have not yet achieved our goals. There is more to be done and many more years to build it. I look at what we've been building for decades. dYdX is a long-term play and we will not stop.
I too have come a long way on this journey. Since founding dYdX on my own at the age of 24, I feel like I have been gifted a lifetime of adventure and growth. Chris Dixon once told me that “founding is an emotional challenge disguised as an intellectual challenge.” Now I've lived it and I know it's true.
dYdX gave me a rollercoaster of intense experiences ranging from fear to excitement, from joy to loneliness.
But now it's time to step down as CEO. Over time, I realized that I didn't actually need to run my own company. I am the founder of dYdX and always will be. I also became the CEO, as most founders find themselves doing. But I discovered that these are two different roles.”

It was seen that there was no change in the DYDX price after this news.

Tesla, Ford, GM Gain After Reports that US Will Hike Chinese EV Tariffs to 102.5% - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



According to Bloomberg, President Joe Biden will announce a significant increase in tariffs on Chinese goods, focusing on electric vehicles (EVs) and related sectors. The move has drawn criticism from former President Donald Trump and sparked a response in U.S. auto stocks, with Ford (NYSE: F), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and General Motors (NYSE: GM) seeing gains over the trading session today.



US to Increase Tariffs on Chinese EVs to 102.5%: Report



Under the new measures, tariffs on Chinese EVs can rise from 27.5% to 102.5%. Other sectors, including batteries, solar cells, steel, and aluminum, will also see tariff hikes, though specific rates will vary. The Biden administration has framed these actions as a defense of American workers and an effort to protect the U.S. market from subsidized Chinese goods.



During a recent campaign rally, former President Donald Trump criticized Biden’s tariff increases, arguing that such measures should have been implemented years ago. He also pointed out a potential loophole involving Chinese companies building cars in Mexico to bypass U.S. tariffs under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).



“I will put a 200% tax on every car that comes in from those plants, and they’re not going to do that,” Trump said. He reiterated his call for a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, which the Biden administration has avoided, likely due to concerns about fueling inflation.





US Auto Stocks Rise After the News



Following the news, U.S. auto stocks experienced significant gains. Tesla Inc., trading at $173.99, saw a 3.27% increase, although its year-to-date performance remains down by 29.91%. Despite recent challenges, Tesla’s market cap remains substantial at approximately $555.654 billion.



Ford Motor Company’s stock price increased by 3.06% to $12.36, with a year-to-date performance up by 5.54%. In response to changing trade policies, the company has been adjusting its executive team and focusing on expanding its electric vehicle lineup.



General Motors Company experienced a 3.42% increase, with its stock price reaching $45.90. The company’s year-to-date performance is significantly positive, with a 28.15% increase. GM’s strategy includes ending production of specific traditional models like the Chevy Malibu and pivoting more towards electric vehicles, which could benefit from the changing tariff landscape.







Would this move benefit US-based EV firms like Tesla in the long run? Let us know in the comments below.

This Week's Agenda in Bitcoin and Altcoins: US Inflation Data! While Inflation Remains Strong, Famous US CEOs Lost Hope on the FED! - Bitcoin Sistemi

As we enter an important week where critical data for Bitcoin and altcoins will be announced, US CPI and PPI data will be announced this week.
Apart from these data, the statements of FED President Jerome Powell and many FED members will also be followed in crypto money and global markets.


While the predictions in the market are for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to remain strong in April; Inflation remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% annual target in the first half of this year, even as higher interest rates dragged it down.
FED officials generally state that it is too early to reduce interest rates and that inflation is still well above the 2% target.





At this point, while expectations for the FED's interest rate cut have decreased since the beginning of 2024, a leading commentary platform, The Kobeissi Letter, stated in its latest assessment that the general expectation is that the CPI will remain high and said, “If the CPI rises again this week, this will indicate the third consecutive monthly increase.” ” said.
The Kobeissi Letter also included the thoughts of the CEOs of leading US companies about the possibility of a rate cut by the FED.


Stating that according to the April Conference Board CEO Confidence survey, the majority of US CEOs expect the FED to cut interest rates only once this year, Kobeissi said, “31% of the 136 CEOs who participated in the survey said they do not expect any interest rate cuts this year; % “26 of them said they expected only two interest rate cuts,” he said.

“38% of famous CEOs expect only one interest rate cut in 2024, while markets are pricing in only 2 interest rate cuts this year, the first of which will be in September.
“The markets dropped from the expectation of 6 interest rate cuts in 2024 to the expectation of 1 or at most 2 interest rate cuts in just 4 months.”

Finally, according to CME FEDWatch, the probability of the FED reducing interest rates in September is priced at 49.6 percent, while the inflation data to be announced on Tuesday and Wednesday this week is expected to have an impact on asset prices such as BTC.

Bitcoin whales hold steady amid short-term holder sell-off: Bitfinex - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin (BTC) short-term holders are behind the recent pullbacks in price, as the negative economic indicators from the US and cautious Federal Reserve statements make them panic, according to the “Bitfinex Alpha” report latest edition. Short-term Bitcoin holders are investors who have held their positions for less than 155 days.Despite the sell-off by short-term holders, on-chain data reveals that long-term holders are not following suit. The “Long-Term Holder Spending Binary Indicator” indicates that these investors have maintained their positions, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics and a possible resolution to the upside for Bitcoin’s price range.Image: Bitfinex/CryptoQuantAmidst this trading behavior, the Bitcoin network has surpassed one billion transactions, highlighting its foundational strength and potential for future value appreciation.The decrease in mining difficulty presents an opportunity for miners to stabilize the network’s hash power and reduce the need to sell mined Bitcoin for operational costs. This is further supported by the commitment of long-term holders, who are demonstrating confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value.Bitcoin’s network fundamentals remain robust, with over 625,000 on-chain transactions recorded on May 6th alone. The network’s ability to handle a high volume of transactions showcases its scalability and security. As the network continues to grow, the challenge will be to scale efficiently to accommodate a larger user base.Image: Bitfinex/BitinfochartsThe recent 6% reduction in mining difficulty is one of the most significant developments, offering relief to miners post-halving. This adjustment allows remaining miners to earn more Bitcoin with the same computational effort.Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced significant volatility, reflecting mixed investor sentiment towards the asset. Last week, Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows, while Ethereum ETFs experienced net outflows, with the BTC price reflecting some of this sentiment.

Crypto investment products see first inflows in over a month - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Digital assets investment products saw $130 million in inflows, the first after four weeks of outflows.
Bitcoin remains above $62k and saw inflows of $144 million this past week.

As Bitcoin shows fresh resilience above $62,000, latest market data reveals that digital asset investment products recorded inflows for the first time in over a month last week.
On Monday, digital assets manager CoinShares published its weekly report on crypto investment products. 
The details showed the industry saw $130 million in inflows for the week ending May 10. It’s the first time the metric reads positive since the first week of April – a run of four weeks of outflows.

Notably, Bitcoin saw inflows of $144 million, while short-Bitcoin ETPs recorded outflows of $5.1 million.
The majority of the inflows were seen in the US, with $135 million. Hong Kong saw $19 million in inflows. Elsewhere, Canada and Germany recorded outflows of $20 million and $15 million respectively.
ETP volumes remain low
While the week saw inflows overall, CoinShares’s head of research James Butterfill wrote in the company blog that ETP volumes have continued to decline.
For instance, the market saw ETP volumes of $8 billion last week, while it averaged $17 billion in April.
“These volumes highlight ETP investors are participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present, representing 22% of total volumes on global trusted exchanges relative to 31% last month,” Butterfill noted.

Brad Garlinghouse Sees SEC Losing Against Crypto in the Long Run, Calls Enforcement Actions ‘Speed Bumps’ - The Daily Hodl


								The chief executive of Ripple Labs says that he sees the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) losing its battle against crypto in the long term.
In a new interview on the World Class podcast, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says that in the grand scheme of things, the SEC’s anti-crypto stances and enforcement actions don’t mean much.










“They’re going to lose in the long run. If you look at the continued growth of crypto as a multi-decade arc of time, this is nothing. It’s a speed bump because I’m so optimistic about what the future of crypto looks like. We’ll look back in 20 years and be like ‘God, that sucked. But you know what, little bump.’
 In my opinion, the market will be measured in many, many, many, many trillions, it will change the way many, many transactions work because it’s a way to reduce friction, reduce cost, [and] make things more efficient. It’s going to win in the long run, the best technology usually wins in the long run.”
Garlinghouse goes on to say that the crypto industry thriving is set in stone because even one of the best-managed fiat currencies – the US dollar – is losing its purchasing power over time.
“It’s inevitable. Right now, we’re talking about a $2.5 trillion [crypto market cap]. Look do I think this is an easy 10x over the next five to 10 years? Yeah, no problem…that feels safe.”

Mysterious Trader Breaks His Three-Year Silence, His Post Increases the Prices of Two Altcoins at Once! One Lucky Investor Made 32X Profit! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Keith Gill, the stock trader and analyst known on social media as “The Roaring Kitty” and who largely fueled the GameStop frenzy in late 2020, has signaled his return to the markets after three years of silence.
While the financial analyst nicknamed “The Roaring Kitty” shared from his X account after a long break, a Solana-based meme token experienced a significant rise after this post.


Although there is no clear statement about Keith Gill's return, his post increased speculation about Gill's return. At this point, the price of Roaring Kitty (KITTY), a Solana-based meme token, has increased by more than 6000%.
This increase in KITTY allowed one lucky investor to make a 32x profit. According to Lookonchain's post, before Keith Gill's post, this investor spent 21.1 SOL (worth 3 thousand dollars) to buy 17.4 million KITTY.

Paolo Ardoino flexes 'top-tier custodians' in Tether v. Ripple stablecoin beef


Ripple chief exec Brad Garlinghouse recently expressed his view via the World Class podcast that the “US Government is going after Tether” before emphasizing how important it is to the ecosystem.
This comment received a response from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino on X (formerly Twitter), who attributed the comments from Garlinghouse to “An uniformed [sic] CEO, leading a company being investigated by the SEC, launching a competitive stablecoin (cui prodest).” 
Ripple announced last month that it intended to launch a US dollar-pegged stablecoin.
In his lengthy tweet, Ardoino also emphasized that Tether has “proved over time to have… top-tier custodians and profound compliance.”

For context re these ‘top-tier custodians,’ Tether once gave nearly a billion dollars of commingled client and corporate funds to an unlicensed money transmitter accused of money laundering for the cartels without even signing a contract.
Additionally, when considering Tether’s profound compliance, it’s important to note that it has previously settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over allegations that it failed to maintain advertised reserves, issued tethers against funds it hadn’t received, and used bank accounts of Tether associates to send and receive funds related to Tether.
Ardoino additionally emphasized that Tether had “onboarded the FBI and USSS for reissuances” and has worked “with 124 law enforcement agencies” over “198 requests from law enforcement to block wallets.” 
He also drew further comparisons between his firm and other stablecoins, pointing out that Tether “cooperates directly with law enforcement agencies, while other stablecoins, although they claim to be ‘more compliant’ they require a judge order, allowing hackers, scammers, and criminals a long time to move funds around.”
Ripple isn’t the only stablecoin issuer who has implied that Tether is among the targets of law enforcement. Indeed, Dante Disparte of Circle accused Tether of “counterfeiting the US dollar.”

This whale action has drawn attention, as depositing large amounts of cryptocurrency is usually deemed a bearish sign due to the high chance of a sell-off.While the aforementioned big player accumulated those SHIB tokens in a matter of weeks for an approximate price of $0.00002408, the trader would make $2.35 million for the same amount, incurring a loss of under $50K. The current SHIB price is slightly below the buying range at $0.00002343. 
Upon further investigation by DailyCoin, it was found that the sender’s cryptocurrency address held no other assets except ‘dust’ amounts of Ethereum (ETH).Here’s Why SHIB Bounced Back Despite 100B DumpAmid the hefty whale action, Shiba Inu’s Derivatives markets have rapidly increased 146% over the latest 24-hour period. Totaling $156.44 million in Derivatives trade volume, the Open Interest (OI) rating has also picked up 10.33% gains, indicating that Futures traders have a renewed interest in the popular meme coin.Meanwhile, the 1,000 times multiplied 1000SHIB contract has also seen similar revitalization with a 161% hike in trading volume, topping $331.31 million over the past 24 hours. While Derivatives traders have placed more short SHIB positions than longs in the last 24 hours, OKX users are the most bullish on SHIB with a 2.65 long versus short ratio. Judging by liquidations, SHIB’s long position holders had a hard time with $1.1 million in long SHIB liquidations over the past 24 hours. Short sellers incurred a $635K combined deficit in SHIB and 1000SHIB smart contracts on the Crypto Derivatives markets.On the Flipside
Despite SHIB’s rejuvenation in Derivatives markets, the newly piqued interest in the token has yet to transform into Shiba Inu’s Spot markets.



According to CoinPaprika, the #12 ranked Shiba Inu plunged by 10% in trading volume, while SHIB sales outweighed the bids by over $11 million.
Why This MattersShiba Inu is a long-term TOP 10 contender with a rapidly growing community and yearly return of 164.5%, based on the latest 365-day timeframe.

XRP Ledger Attracts The Next Asian Institutional Validator


								Infinite Block, a Korean virtual asset service provider (VASP), has joined the XRP Ledger as a validator, according to a statement released by the company on May 13. The Seoul-based firm, led by CEO Jung Gu-tae, aims to foster the stable expansion of the ledger within Korea’s stringent regulatory framework.
XRP Ledger Gets Another Institutional Validator From Asia
Infinite Block, established by a group of Korea’s foremost regulatory and financial experts, notably secured a VASP license after being the sole qualifier among approximately 50 applicants in 2023. This credential underscores its compliance with Korea’s robust virtual asset regulations, including the international Travel Rule and anti-money laundering standards.

The XRPL, a decentralized open-source protocol active since 2012, has processed over 2.5 billion transactions. Among the prominent contributors to the ecosystem are Ripple, the XRPL Foundation, and XRPL Labs. XRP, the native token of the ledger, is currently ranked seventh globally in terms of market capitalization among virtual assets.
The entry of Infinite Block as a validator is seen as a significant step in both bolstering the domestic blockchain environment and enhancing Korea’s position on the international stage. The company plans to engage in stable governance, expand the ecosystem, and offer services to corporations, all while adhering to domestic and international compliance standards.
CEO Jung Gu-tae emphasized the strategic importance of this move. “As a fully regulated custodial business operator, we will provide blockchain regulatory support infrastructure suitable for the institutional characteristics of the Korean virtual asset industry,” he said. “We will contribute not only to user protection but also to enhancing the reliability based on thorough regulatory compliance, both domestically and internationally.”

Emi Yoshikawa, Ripple’s Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, welcomed the development. “Hot off the press from Korea. Infinite Block, a VASP licensed custody company in South Korea, is now running a validator on the XRP Ledger. Great to see more and more institution-grade validators are participating in the ecosystem from Asia!” Yoshikawa stated via social media platform X.
The announcement by Infinite Block coincides with other institutional engagements, noted lawyer Bill Morgan, who speculated on the timing relative to similar news from SBI Holdings. “Can’t be a coincidence so soon after the SBI entity became an validator,” Morgan commented, hinting at a possibly coordinated expansion of institutional support within the ecosystem in Asia.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.5045.

Bitcoin Regains $63K as Japan Public Firm Migrates to BTC-only Reserve


							

Metaplanet adopts Bitcoin as its main treasury asset in response to Japan’s economic challenges.



The company boasts a Bitcoin portfolio of 117.7 BTC worth $32.71 million.



Bitcoin value reclaimed $63K amid Metaplanet’s new BTC-only reserver policy.




Metaplanet, a Japanese public company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has unveiled a white paper detailing its decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. This strategic pivot comes as a response to Japan’s persistent economic challenges, which include high levels of government debt, enduring negative real interest rates, and a weakening yen.



Metaplanet’s white paper outlines a “Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only” approach, departing from traditional treasury management strategies. The company strongly believes in Bitcoin’s fundamental advantages over traditional currencies, other stores of value, and different crypto-assets. 



Furthermore, Metaplanet hails Bitcoin as an “absolutely scarce digital synthetic monetary commodity” with a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. According to the paper, this feature sets Bitcoin apart from other monetary systems and commodities.



Contrary to widespread criticism, Metaplanet champions Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism as a critical advantage. The white paper highlights the mining difficulty adjustment, which ensures that the cost of producing new bitcoins increases over time, as a unique attribute that distinguishes Bitcoin from traditional commodities.









Looking ahead, Metaplanet plans to leverage various capital market instruments to grow its Bitcoin reserves. This strategy seeks to protect the company’s balance sheet from the yen’s devaluation and establish Metaplanet as a forward-thinking investment vehicle on the global stage. 



By capitalizing on Japan’s unique position with low global capital costs, the company aims to enhance its competitive edge internationally. According to public records, Metaplanet holds 117.7 BTC, valued at $32.71 million. The news of Metaplanet migrating to a Bitcoin-only reserve has had a notable impact on the value of BTC. At press time, Bitcoin has increased by over 3% to reclaim the $63K threshold following the news.

Bitcoin miner Bitfarms CEO to depart immediately in response to lawsuit

Geoffrey Morphy, the now former President and CEO of cryptocurrency mining firm Bitfarms, will be stepping down immediately after filing a lawsuit against the company in Canada.In a May 13 notice, Bitfarms said it had terminated Morphy as CEO and president ahead of a previously announced plan to have him continue leading the company until a replacement could be found. According to the mining firm, Morphy filed a $27 million lawsuit against Bitfarms on May 10 in the Superior Court of Ontario, claiming “breach of contract, wrongful dismissal and aggravated and punitive damages.”“The Company believes the claims are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously,” said Bitfarms. “Nicolas Bonta, Chairman and Co-Founder of the Company, has been appointed interim President and Chief Executive Officer, and will lead the Company until the executive search is completed and [Morphy’s] successor is appointed.”Bitfarms announced in March that it planned to seek a replacement for Morphy, who had been with the company since 2020. According to the mining firm, it will appoint a new CEO “in the next several weeks.” Cointelegraph reached out to Morphy for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Related: Bitcoin miner Bitfarms purchases additional 51,908 ASICs amid bull marketFounded in 2017, Bitfarms has 11 Bitcoin (BTC) mining facilities in the United States, Canada, Paraguay and Argentina. The firm announced in April that it planned to invest roughly $240 million to upgrade its mining equipment following the BTC halving event, potentially increasing its hash rate capacity to 21 exahashes per second. The company reported earning 269 BTC in mining rewards and transaction fees in April and is expected to announce its earnings for the first quarter of 2024 on May 15. At the time of publication, Bitfarms’ stock (BITF) on the Nasdaq was trading at $1.61, having fallen roughly 29% since March 25.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

                        MoonPay confirmed to Cryptonews on Monday that it has donated $1 million to the digital advocacy group Stand With Crypto ahead of the 2024 elections.“Today, two things are abundantly clear: this year’s election will define the future of our industry in the United States, and it is our responsibility to step up and stand alongside those organizations that want to positively advance crypto innovation for everyone,” the crypto payment service said in a statement.MoonPay Makes Big Stand With Crypto Donation
Founded by Ivan Soto-Wright and Victor Faramond in 2019, MoonPay donated because of “mounting regulatory pressure” on the blockchain industry.The digital asset company’s announcement comes just days after news broke that Stand With Crypto launched its own political action committee (PAC) slated to fund pro-crypto politicians running for office across the U.S.“In solidarity with Stand With Crypto, we are supporting elected officials to create a clear regulatory framework for crypto that fosters innovation while protecting consumers,” MoonPay’s statement continued.Crypto Heats Up Amidst 2024 Elections
Stand With Crypto has backed several political candidates so far this year,  including Congressional candidates Eddy Morales (D-OR), Shomari Figures (D-AL), and Troy Downing (R-MT), as well as Senatorial hopefuls Jim Justice (R-WV) and Jim Banks (R-IN).“The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates of Stand With Crypto throughout November,” Nick Carr, Chief Strategist for Stand With Crypto, told Reuters last week.But Monday’s donation is far from the first time MoonPay has been tied to the U.S. political scene.Last year, Soto-Wright made headlines for a $500,000 donation to Bitcoin-friendly Miami Mayor Frances Suarez made via an LLC owned and controlled by the MoonPay founder, prompting a complaint to be filed with the Federal Election Commission.Critics argue that his mayoral donation may have violated straw donor laws since the funds were provided by the MoonPay founder instead of the money his LLC generated. Soto-Wright has since denied any wrongdoing.The digital asset payment services provider’s Stand With Crypto donation comes as tensions rise over the 2024 U.S. presidential election, with recent polls showing Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden nearly tied.Trump has long been known for his positive stance toward digital assets and announced just last week that his campaign will be taking donations in cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, Biden has advocated for increased regulation within the sector, recently announcing he would veto any attempts to overturn the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s SAB 121.

Ripple CEO Clarifies Tether Comments After A Critical Tweet From Garlinghouse



	

Key Points:




Ripple CEO highlighted U.S. actions towards Tether.



Tether CEO stated $1.3 billion in illicit transactions were blocked.



Garlinghouse defended Tether, hinting at U.S. desire for control.




Ripple CEO clarifies Tether Comments, acknowledging its importance in the crypto ecosystem amidst US government actions. He defended Tether, suggesting the US wants more control over stablecoin issuers.



Ripple CEO Clarifies Tether Comments After A Critical Tweet From Garlinghouse


On May 13, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse shed light on the U.S. government’s actions towards Tether (USDT issuer). 



Garlinghouse’s Perspectives on U.S. Actions Towards Tether



Although acknowledging Tether’s importance in the ecosystem, Garlinghouse couldn’t predict the impact of these actions on the broader crypto industry. 



His comments were made amidst revelations of USDT being used by sanctioned countries and terrorist organizations to evade U.S. financial restrictions.




U.S. Treasury Deputy Secretary, Adewale Adeyemo, highlighted Russia’s increased use of Tether to circumvent economic sanctions.

Reactions and Responses from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino



In response, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino criticized Garlinghouse’s comments as fear-mongering on Twitter, reminding that Ripple was undergoing an SEC investigation itself. Ardoino’s tweet accused Garlinghouse of spreading fear about USDT.



According to Paolo Ardoino, Tether has blocked over $1.3 billion in illicit transactions over the past three years, including around $1.6 million related to terrorist financing. 





Tether has cooperated with law enforcement, blocking wallets upon 339 requests, 158 from the U.S., and has blocked over $639 million in collaboration with U.S. law enforcement.



Ripple CEO Clarifies Tether Comments



Garlinghouse later defended Tether on Twitter, reiterating its importance in the ecosystem and his belief that the U.S. government’s actions stem from a desire for more control over dollar-backed stablecoin issuers. 




My point was that the US govt has clearly indicated they want more control over USD-backed stablecoin issuers, and thus, Tether, as the largest player, is in their line of sight.
Garlinghouse wrote

Has XRP Survived Its Worst Drawdown?

The broader crypto ecosystem is in recovery mode, a trend that is currently being led by Bitcoin (BTC). At the moment, the combined crypto market cap has soared by 1.44% in 24 hours with the valuation coming in at $2.29 trillion. Of this reboot, the XRP price is subtly in the spotlight as it has joined the rally to flip its most important resistance in the short term.At the time of writing, the coin is changing hands for $0.5047 atop a 0.2% surge in 24 hours. While XRP is still down by 5.09% for the week, market watchers believe the current flipping of the $0.5 resistance point's support might suggest the worst of the drawdown is over.After soaring as high as $0.72 this year, XRP backtracked and fell as low as $0.48. The coin has been struggling from this low price level and the $0.57 point since at least mid-April. Breaking the $0.5 level now serves as a litmus test for XRP as analysts anticipate what the next moves will be.Overall, XRP has maintained relatively poorer-than-expected volatility; however, with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) now pegged at 43.15, the overselling may soon be in reverse mode. There has been a lot of network development around the XRP Ledger protocol that might impact the outlook of XRP in the long term. With new validators being onboarded, XRPL now stands as one of the L1 protocols with a massive enterprise backer, including SBI and Infinite Block.The outcome of the Ripple v. SEC lawsuit may also shape the future growth prospects of XRP in the long term. Should Ripple Labs be charged a minimal deterrent fee for violating securities laws as concerns sales of XRP to institutional investors, there may be a boom in the price of the coin overall.

Antonio Juliano steps down as CEO of dYdX

The founder of the decentralized exchange dYdX is stepping down as CEO after seven years of heading the crypto derivatives platform.In a May 13 blog post, Antonio Juliano announced his decision to move from the exchange's daily operations to the position of chairman and president. "I’m stepping down as CEO of dYdX Trading In., transitioning to Chairman & President," wrote Juliano. The company is now led by Ivo Crnkovic-Rubsamen, dYdX’s former chief strategy officer. According to his LinkedIn profile, Crnkovic-Rubsamen is a former trader who has worked at the decentralized exchange since 2022.“As I realized I did not need to be CEO, I worked to shepherd other leaders at the company on their own leadership journeys, until one of them was ready to run the company himself,” said Juliano in reference to Crnkovic-Rubsamen. Juliano did not mention his future professional goals but suggested a “next step” for his career: “I have no plans for what comes next for me, and no idea what I’ll do.” Prior to founding dYdX, Juliano was a software engineer at companies such as Coinbase, Uber and MongoDB.According to data from DefiLlama, dYdX has seen a surge in activity in recent months as the crypto markets rebounded. The DEX has a market capitalization of more than $1.1 billion at the time of writing, and $463 million in total value locked. The DEX's annualized revenue is at $35.4 million. In total, derivatives activity generated over $1.31 trillion of trading volume since 2021. Derivatives volume at dYdX. Source: DefiLlama.Much of the recent trading activity could be linked to ongoing developments surrounding the protocol, such as the launch of dYdX's own layer-1 blockchain in October 2023. Based on the native DYDX token for network transactions, the network enables returning gas fees back to validators and stakers as rewards. In addition, dYdX rolled out its v4 upgrade in January, moving the DEX from Ethereum to the Cosmos network. Magazine: 1 in 6 new Base meme coins are scams, 91% have vulnerabilities

Amid Biotech Pitfalls, this Stock Has Outperformed NVDA in the Last 3 Months - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Biotech stocks, especially of smaller companies, are notoriously risky investment exposures. Because their bread and butter is drug development, its complexity cannot be easily accounted for. 



Although the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 86% of new molecular entities (NMEs) in 2022, they must pass multiple clinical phase trials. According to a study from Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) Industry Analysis and BioMedTracker (BMT), the FDA, on average, approved nearly 9% of Phase I in the early 2000s. 



Additionally, the probability of success (PoS) shifts depending on the use of biomarkers in patient selection, according to the 2019 Biostatistics study. During those trying times, biotech companies must carefully balance their limited budgets until a drug pipeline hits the jackpot, as recently happened with Legend Biotech’s (NASDAQ: LEGN) CARVYKTI for bone marrow cancer.



The added complexity of biotech investing is financial. By the time Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) paid $43 billion for oncology firm Seagen (SGEN) in December 2023, the stock had gained 70% value on a yearly basis, from $124 to $212 per share. This indicates that behind-the-scenes dealings can cut short potential upside for retail investors.



Given these factors, what is ImmunityBio (NASDAQ: IBRX) ‘s status as a prospective biostock candidate?



ImmunityBio’s Claim to Fame



Founded in 2014 in San Diego, California, ImmunityBio is a clinical-stage biotech firm. As its name suggests, it specializes in immunity-enhancing therapies and vaccines. In particular, the FDA approved ImmunityBio’s Anktiva this April. The drug is designated an FDA Breakthrough Therapy, as it activates the body’s T-cell immune system to attack tumor cells.



In combination with ImmunityBio’s Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, Anktiva (N-803) is set to treat non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) from mid-May. For investors, bladder cancer is fairly common, at an average rate of 18.2 per 100,000, with 75-80% of newly diagnosed cases classified as NMBIC.



In 2024, Anktiva’s addressable market in the US is 83,190, as estimated new cases by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program under the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Of course, this doesn’t account for cases in which life expectancy varies according to stage. For example, stage 0 has a 98% five-year survival rate, while stage III bladder cancer has a 46% five-year survival rate.



The new drug’s recommended dosage is once per week for six weeks, with a potential follow-up after three months. Anktiva’s pricing strategy is set at around $35,800 per dose, potentially generating around $1.1 million in revenue, including course and maintenance. 





ImmunityBio’s Financials



On May 9th, ImmunityBio delivered its Q1 2024 earnings. Typical of smaller biotech startups, the firm reported a $134.1 million net loss, substantially higher than the $116.6 million net loss in the year-ago quarter. In share terms, this was a $0.20 net loss per common share (basic and diluted).



However, operating expense losses decreased from $111.9 million to $95.2 million during the period. ImmunityBio left the quarter with $133.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash ($334k). 



The company’s liabilities remained flat at $1.091 billion from the year-ago quarter. This puts the debt-to-equity ratio at a high negative 1.161, confirming that the company has more debt than assets. However, this is not that surprising for the capital-intensive biotech sector.



Against the industry average of 24.83, ImmunityBio’s price-to-earnings (PE) ratio was -8.2 in 2023 and estimated -10.83 for 2024, per Nasdaq data. With the rollout of Anktiva and BCG, the P/E growth forecast in 2024 is 24.75. The latter PEG value is determined by dividing the P/E ratio by the expected future earnings growth rate.



ImmunityBio’s Price Moves and Forecast



Over a one-year period, IBRX stock is up 165%, or 62.8% year-to-date, firmly leaving the penny stock territory in March. From the 52-week low of $1.25, IBRX shares are now 550% up at $8.12 per share.



However, this is still 23% lower than the 52-week high of $10.53, suggesting some room for growth ahead of the Anktiva launch. Nasdaq’s aggregated forecast data suggests an average price target twelve months ahead of $6 per share. WSJ’s average price target is more optimistic at $7.50 per share.

OKX surpasses 50% of Bitcoin Runes market share

Crypto exchange OKX now accounts for 51.08% of Bitcoin Runes' daily trading volume through its Web3 marketplace. According to data from Ordinals analytic platform GeniiData, Runes' trading activity on other platforms, such as UniSat and MagicEden, has steadily declined since April, holding a combined 48.83% market share. Almost all Bitcoin Runes' trading activity is conducted through the three aforementioned firms and their platforms. Bitcoin Runes' trading activity by exchange. Source: GeniiDataRunes is a new protocol for issuing fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network that launched on April 20, the day of the Bitcoin halving. Less than one month after its inception, the protocol has generated a staggering 2,287 BTC ($143.6 million) in transaction fees and now forms the basis of the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem along with Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which were invented last year. It's not just Bitcoin Runes that are gaining traction within the ecosystem. Since its launch in April, Omnichain yield-generating protocol SolvBTC, which allows users to earn yields on their Bitcoin through minted derivatives on Arbitrum, Merlin, and BNB Smart Chain, has accumulated $920.62 million in total value locked. The protocol currently has over 12,000 BTC staked among 30,000 participants and generates annual returns of 5% to 10% on users’ BTC deposits. On April 30, the firm announced it would introduce re-staking yields for its users’ Bitcoin through a partnership with Babylon. The Babylon protocol allows users to self-custody their idle BTC and earn rewards from using the underlying BTC to verify transactions on proof-of-stake networks. Fisher Yu, co-founder of Babylon, said that he hopes that Bitcoin can become more than a store of value but also a “source of dynamic, secure yield” for DeFi. Babylon explaining the mechanism of its BTC staking protocol.

Under the proposal, 65% of its native SPACE token would be distributed to builds according to their respective contribution. The project currently has a diluted market cap of $166 million.On May 6, the Bitcoin blockchain surpassed 1 billion in transactions. During its 5,603-day existence, Bitcoin has had an average of 178,475 daily transactions. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s biggest rival, Ethereum, has processed well over two billion transactions since it launched in July 2015. Related: El Salvador launches $360M Bitcoin treasury monitoring website

__________Meme Coin News: Market Highlights
The meme market capitalization increased by 1.8% over the last 24 hours. It currently stands at $52.2 billion.Dogecoin (DOGE) is at the top per market cap, with 20.76 billion.In second place is Shiba Inu (SHIB), having seen a market cap of $13.84 billion.Pepe Coin (PEPE)’s cap is significantly smaller, standing in third place with $3.7 billion.DOGE also holds tight to the first place per 24-hour market volume, with $52.6 billion.Dogwifhat (WIF) is in the second place, recording $889 million.This is a significant difference between the two first positions.Source: cryptonews.com/coins/meme-coins/Looking at the prices over the past 24 hours, three out of the top 10 meme coins per market cap are down today.These are WIF, COQ, and MEME, each down between 0.5% and 2%.SHIB is the best performer in this category, as its price appreciated 4% to $0.00002.BONE follows it, increasing by 2.6% and trading at $0.57782.The remaining coins are up between 0.5% (BABYDOGE) and 2% (DOGE).All of these coins’ prices have dropped over the past seven days.WIF sank 19%, DOGE decreased by 14.5%, FLOKI is down 12.8%, SHIB declined by 8.1%, and PEPE fell 3%, among others.Base Chain Rising as Home for Meme Coins
Base has been receiving increasingly more attention since its launch – and may be on its way to surpassing Solana. This would be very beneficial for the coins it houses.There are several reasons why this may occur. Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 blockchain is expecting significant ecosystem developments, but also on-chain metrics are nothing to ignore.Important developments include Base Chain Smart Wallet and a smart contract called ‘Magic Spend.’As for on-chain metrics, looking at Base’s 24-hour trading volume, we find it at $125.47 million today, according to DeFiLlama.At the beginning of this year, that number was just 21.63 million.Furthermore, its total value locked (TVL) stands at $1.508 billion, nearing its $1.65 all-time high.Again, at the beginning of the year, TVL stood at $437 million. This is a massive 245% increase over four months.Source: defillama.comAs for Solana, it has $4.02 billion in TVL, compared to $1.4 billion at the beginning of the year.  This is a 187% increase.Its current 24-hour volume is $598.93 million, compared to $545.88 on January 1.Besides the discussions about Base potentially surpassing Solana, there are also debates over which chain is faster.BRETT at the Top Among Base-Based Meme Coins
Speaking of the Base chain, this is a good opportunity to check out its top 10 meme coins.The Base meme coins’ market capitalization today is $877 million.Brett (BRETT) is at the very top per market cap with $289.4 million.DEGEN is next with $235.1 million.These two coins alone account for $524.5 million out of the $877 million.TOSHI is the only other coin with a market cap of over $100 million.Source: coingecko.comOver the last 24 hours, only three coins – NORMIE, HIGHER, and BRETT – are down. While the first two fell around 10% each, the third is down 4%.As for the green coins, BOOMER is the best performer by far. It’s up nearly 40% to $0.03265.DOGINME is in the distant second place with a rise of 12% to $0.0002355.The rest are up between 0.5% and 5%.However, the 7-day picture is entirely red.HIGHER and NORMIE saw the largest drop, each over 30%.Meanwhile, DEGEN recorded the highest 24-hour volume of $26.6 million.Mfercoin (MFER) is in the second place with $9.3 million.BONK Enables Email Login, Launches E-cards
Meme coin BONK announced several developments this week.On Wednesday, the project’s teams revealed that it joined hands with TipLink, a lightweight wallet designed to make transferring digital assets as easy as sending a link.BONK said its users can now use only email login on BONKrewards and lock their coins.There are currently over 3.28 trillion BONK locked there.Per TipLink’s documentation, a crypto user can create a TipLink and send that link to anyone over any platform, be it a text, discord, email, or something else.“The amazing thing is, the link is the wallet,” it said.TopLinks can hold SOL, SPL tokens (tokens that operate on the Solana blockchain), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and semi-fungible tokens (SFTs).Therefore, TipLink offers decentralization and self-custody without seed phrases, key management, apps, and browser extensions, the project stated.Then, on Saturday, BONK announced that it launched BONKmark E-cards ahead of Mother’s Day.Thanks to the collaboration with TipLink, it allows users to send BONK anywhere with email only, and “have moms all over the world use their BONK.”BONK said it would show the recipients how to send the BONK to a CEX, change it to fiat, or deposit it to BONKrewards.E-cards include several designs for Mother’s Day, celebrations, and milestones.

Arthur Hayes: 'Major Economies To Print Even More Money' In The Next 24 Months - Benzinga

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, on Monday laid out a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency market, fueled by factors including the upcoming US presidential election and continued expansion of the monetary base.What Happened: Hayes believes the election will lead to looser monetary policies as the Biden administration seeks re-election, a scenario historically correlated with crypto rallies.Discussing the potential catalysts for Bitcoin‘s BTC/USD price movement, Hayes stated, “You can look at the previous halvings and anywhere between 4 to 18 months later you get a new all-time high. More important thing is that the major economies around the world are going to print even more money between now and, say, the next 18 to 24 months.”He pinpointed the U.S. presidential election as a pivotal event, explaining, “It’s the global empire, its financial policy influences with the Chinese, the Japanese, the Europeans all do.”Hayes elaborated on the strategies likely to be employed by current U.S. leaders to secure an election win, suggesting significant monetary easing could be on the horizon. “Janet Yellen, the U.S. Treasury secretary, and Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, are doing everything they can to make sure that Joe Biden gets reelected. And that basically means how do I reduce the cost of government borrowing so that him and his Democratic Party can hand out more goodies to the electorate and get reelected?”Also Read: ‘Republicans Smell Blood In The Water:’ Uniswap CEO Warns Democrats Of ‘Swing States Level Miscalculation’ On CryptoWith the election approaching, Hayes predicts both parties will promise financial incentives to voters, funded by increased national borrowing and monetary expansion. “Regardless of who wins, whoever wins there are campaigning on. I’m going to give you something that you don’t have to pay for, and I’m going to pay for it by borrowing my money. I’m going to pay for it by using the central bank to print money.”Hayes also touched on the M2 money supply indicator, noting its significant correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements. “The problem with M2 is that it doesn’t capture all the things that are used as credit money in the economy. And every time there’s a new problem, the elites in charge come up with a new way to confuse people about how they’re going to print money.”What’s Next: The implications of the U.S. presidential election on the global financial landscape, including cryptocurrencies, will be a significant theme at Benzinga's upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.The event is set to explore how geopolitical and economic policies might shape the future of digital currencies and assets.Read Next: Bitcoin Up 3%: What Will Inflation Data And Powell Speech Bring This Week?Image: Shutterstock

MoonPay Backs ‘Stand With Crypto’ Group with a Donation - DailyCoin


        

MoonPay has donated to a crypto advocacy group.



The company said the donation was on behalf of everyone on its team.



The donation comes a few days after the advocacy group created a new political committee.




Web3 infrastructure firm MoonPay announced on Monday that it has donated to the Coinbase-led digital assets advocacy group Stand With Crypto.



MoonPay’s donation comes after the advocacy group formed a new Political Action Committee (PAC) on May 10. The PAC aims to raise money from over 400,000 members to support crypto-friendly candidates in U.S. elections.



“In Solidarity with Stand With Crypto”



On March 13, MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright shared a note with his team members, informing them that the company had “made a donation on behalf of everyone” to Stand With Crypto.




The CEO emphasized the importance of the upcoming U.S. elections to the crypto industry, noting that MoonPay is supporting like-minded elected officials in creating a clear regulatory framework that fosters crypto innovation and consumer protection.



“Today, two things are abundantly clear: this year's election will define the future of our industry in the United States; and, it is our responsibility to step up and stand alongside those organizations that genuinely wish to positively advance this innovation for everyone,” Ivan wrote.



While MoonPay CEO’s note to employees did not specify how much was donated, Fox Business Journalist Eleanor Terret claimed that the donation amounted to $1 million.



In the meantime, the Coinbase-led initiative has recruited 479,975 advocates and 165,330 policymaker contacts to fight to keep crypto in the U.S. According to the group’s website, Stand With Crypto advocates have donated over $86 million so far.

DVT 101: All You Need to Know on ETH Staking with Decentralized Validator Technology


																By Adam Efrima
The crypto space is full of buzzwords and abbreviations, and today, I’ll be discussing one that’s not quite so widespread yet: Decentralized Validator Technology, or DVT. It promises to fix a major worry about how traditional validator setups operate on Ethereum by significantly decentralizing and securing the process.
Validators are the entities that build blocks in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, similar to miners in Bitcoin (and other Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols). Ever since Ethereum moved entirely to PoS in September 2022 with The Merge, the blockchain has been supported by a set of approximately 900,000 validators, which theoretically makes it the most decentralized PoS network currently live.
However, not all that glitter is gold in this space. Multiple issues have been raised regarding how PoS is currently implemented in Ethereum, all of which contribute to making it a bit less decentralized than it would seem. But first, we need to dive into the weeds of what a validator in Ethereum really is.
Ethereum Validators Aren’t Like the Rest
A big difference between Ethereum and other PoS networks is that the validator nodes need to have a stake of 32 ETH — no more, no less. This limit was chosen so that it’d offer a reasonable entry point for average Joes to stake while still not creating too many validators for no reason. Right now, 32 ETH is worth about $95,000, but back when staking was first introduced (first as a separate chain) in 2020, it was closer to $30,000.
If you hold more than 32 ETH though, you’ll need to split your stake between multiple “validators,” which explains the very large number of active validators today. In practice, there are likely 10,000-20,000 independent entities (including companies and indie stakers) who are contributing to Ethereum security.
On a technical level, validators are a special entity controlled by their own private keys, which are activated when a prospective staker bridges 32 ETH to the Beacon chain. This chain manages the consensus process, assigning a portion of validators to propose blocks while others “attest” that these blocks are correct. Behaving improperly, for example, by signing invalid blocks or by being offline, leads to stake slashing (though it’s usually quite soft) or penalties incurred on the ETH principal.
Many PoS systems (a.k.a Delegated-PoS or DPoS) enable stake delegation, where users can natively assign their coins to a particular validator, who they trust to do a good job validating the chain and earning staking yield (a centralizing force). On Ethereum, there are no native mechanisms to do this, meaning that people must either run their own validator (self-custody of keys) or trust a service to do so — that is, until DVT came along.
The Pressing Need to Decentralize Staking
The premise of Proof-of-Stake is that no single entity can control more than a certain percentage of the total stake that is currently engaged in validating a protocol. In that case, they can dictate what is the “majority” chain and start behaving incorrectly without penalties, jeopardizing the functioning of the network.
In Ethereum, currently, the vast majority of the staking power is held by Lido, a decentralized finance protocol that offers a convenient “wrapper” or liquid staking token (LST) of a user’s staked position called stETH. The benefit of this system is that you can just stake on the protocol or even buy the token and start staking to earn yield without doing anything else — the underlying system does everything for you.
Lido as a whole currently controls a bit more than 31% of the ETH staked, which is dangerously close to the 33% threshold needed to prevent Ethereum blocks from being finalized (if Lido wished to do so). This sounds worse than it really is: Lido is a decentralized protocol that spreads its stake over many independent node operators, so it can’t really coordinate easily to perform this attack.
Also, as a decentralized business whose entire model relies on being trusted by the Ethereum community, it has no incentive to do so. Finally, a 33% attack is not the end of the world for Ethereum, as it’d just result in blocks not being finalized — they’d still be correct, and the attacker wouldn’t be able to really exploit this issue.
But despite some caveats, some in the community are uneasy about Lido’s dominance, as ultimately, the node operators it chooses have custody over the staked ETH and control part of the validation process. Lido has, however, started implementing technologies to decentralize its node operations by integrating the Simple DVT module.
These advancements promote increased participation and collaboration, facilitating smaller operators to align with larger counterparts thereby fostering a more diverse and robust network. This inclusive approach sets the stage for a trustless future, allowing even at-home validators to integrate with Lido seamlessly.
Decentralized Validator Technology to the Rescue
If the issue is that validators are custodial and somewhat centralized, the logical solution is to turn this process into a decentralized and trustless mechanism. This is, in a nutshell, what DVT offers today.
DVT works by splitting an Ethereum validator’s private key into multiple shares via various cryptographic techniques. The shares are encrypted and distributed to node operators, who then simultaneously run the validator to contribute to Ethereum’s security. Because the actual validator key is never seen or controlled by the operators, the process becomes non-custodial, trustless, secure, and much more fault-tolerant.
DVT is only starting out, but it could be a significant part of Ethereum’s future roadmap. As the network pushes for more scalability, there are serious discussions of increasing the 32 ETH limit to make the total validator numbers more manageable. To counteract the increase in centralization, DVT is being proposed as one of the ways to enable fully decentralized staking pools for smaller users.

Liminal Expands into Asia with Abu Dhabi Approval - Coin Edition


							

Liminal, a Singapore-based custody service provider, expands to Abu Dhabi after regulatory approval.



Recent regulatory wins in Dubai and India signify Liminal’s broader regional presence.



Strategic vision involves extending regulatory footprint beyond current markets to serve institutional clients globally.




Liminal, a Singapore-based custody service provider, has expanded beyond its shores by attaining regulatory approval in Abu Dhabi. As reported by the company’s spokesperson, Liminal’s subsidiary, First Answer Middle East, has been granted Financial Services Permission (FSP) by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). 



In light of this, Liminal can provide custody services in UAE’s second-most populous city, following in-principal approval received last year.



Moreover, the company has witnessed several regulatory advancements over the past week. It has received the green light in the Asian Pacific (APAC), Middle East, and North Africa (MENA) regions. On another positive note, Liminal’s Dubai arm, First Answer Custody FZE, recently secured initial approval from the emirate’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA). 



Speaking on the development, Liminal’s Senior Vice President of Strategy and Business Operations, Manan Vora, noted, “We initiated a strategic drive two years ago to secure regulatory licenses in key markets across APAC and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), strategically positioning ourselves to cater to institutional clients.”



Vora added that Liminal aims to move beyond its technology presence in Europe and Taiwan to get regulatory approval in these regions. The VP also mentioned Liminal’s involvement as a technology provider for Indonesia’s “sovereign digital asset exchange.”









Meanwhile, India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) disclosed that Liminal’s Indian subsidiary has been registered as a reporting entity, making it the first digital asset custodian to achieve this recognition. This follows Liminal’s appointment by India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to manage seized digital assets in November.



Furthermore, Liminal has been busy on its home front, offering custody solutions in Singapore before the country introduced new licensing requirements in April. As such, it was grandfathered into the new guidelines, an agreement set for six months. Nonetheless, the company has notified the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) of its intention to apply for a license.

Uniswap Founder Slams Biden's Administration for Not Supporting Crypto | Coinspeaker



Adams said that despite the Republicans’ efforts, Biden can still turn the tables around if he can reverse his stance on crypto and rein in the SEC and Senator Warren’s anti-crypto efforts.

The Biden administration has been under fire, especially after former US President Donald Trump leveraged Joe Biden’s perceived anti-crypto stance as a campaign tactic to sway voters ahead of the November elections.
Last Wednesday, the Democratic government publicly announced its lack of interest in the emerging economy, revealing their plans to overhaul any existing legislation allowing banks to custody cryptocurrencies in the country if re-elected in the upcoming presidential election.




The government’s apparent aversion to the crypto sector has drawn criticism from industry figures like Uniswap founder Hayden Adams. In a lengthy post on X, he condemned Biden’s approach to crypto regulation, likening it to a significant “political misstep”.
Underestimation of Crypto’s Electoral Impact
Adams compared Biden’s approach to crypto regulation to Hillary Clinton’s focus on campaigning in traditionally Republican states (red states) rather than swing states during her presidential campaign.
He argued that the Biden administration underestimates the role crypto will play in the 2024 election, hence their lack of urgency in addressing regulatory concerns.
The Uniswap founder disclosed that while the Democrats are hesitant to embrace crypto, the Republicans are capitalizing on the opportunity to grow their supporters by intensifying their support for the emerging economy. In his words, the “Republicans smell blood in the water and are turning hard towards crypto”.
He further noted that Trump and his Republican party are taking advantage of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Senator Elizabeth Warren’s hardline stance against crypto to garner more support from members of the crypto community.
Call for Immediate Action
Adams said that despite the Republicans’ efforts, Biden can still turn the tables around if he can reverse his stance on crypto and rein in the SEC and Senator Warren’s anti-crypto efforts.
He called on those close to the US president and within the Democratic leadership to recognize the seriousness of the issue and advocate for an immediate reversal of Biden’s crypto stance to survive the upcoming election.
“Not much time for Biden to save it. Any one close to him or their leadership should be expressing how serious this is and pushing for immediate reversal on his approach to crypto (public support/plan and reigning in sec + warren),” he wrote on X.
Election Forecast: Trump Leads Biden in Key States
Meanwhile, recent polling data suggests that if the 2024 presidential election were held today, Trump would secure victory over Biden to reclaim the White House.
A report from the New York Times on Monday revealed that the former US president emerged victorious in five out of six crucial US states polled by the news media between April 28 and May 9, 2024.
The polling data, which included registered voters from diverse racial backgrounds, showed Trump winning support from both White and Black Americans in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. In contrast, Biden only managed to secure victory in one battleground state Wisconsin.

XRP 7-Year Long Accumulation Draws To An End, What This Means For The Price | Bitcoinist.com


								Expectations for the XRP price have fluctuated greatly in the last year, mostly due to the uncertainty that continues to cloud the Ripple legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, bullishness has prevailed despite the altcoin’s disappointing performance in 2024, with one analyst pretending an end to what has been a drawn-out accumulation trend.
XRP Price To Breakout As Accumulation Trend Ends
Crypto analyst U-Copy took to X (formerly Twitter) to share their prediction for the XRP price. The chart attached with the post puts the altcoin in a 7-year accumulation trend, which is set to end soon and trigger an upward rally for the price.
Related Reading: Important Shiba Inu Event Sparks Excitement Among Community Members – What’s It About?
The crypto analyst pointed out that the cryptocurrency is currently forming a triangle along the accumulation trend, which has happened once before in history. The first time was between 2013 and 2017, when the XRP Price saw a long, drawn-out accumulation. However, at the end of this accumulation was the icing on the cake as the price rallied from around $0.005 to $2.5 in the space of one year. This translated to an almost 500,000% increase in price.
Given how the price reacted when the altcoin completed its accumulation in 2017, the crypto analyst is expecting a similar reaction. This time around, the accumulation began in 2018 and has preserved through to 2024. It is almost twice as long as the last time this trend appeared and this could see a blowout rally at the end.
U-Copy explains that this accumulation trend will end in the year 2024 and the rally could begin from here. This is interesting given that expectations around the Ripple vs. SEC battle ending this year are high and investors expect the price to response positively to this development.
Where Is The Price Headed?
While the crypto analyst didn’t give a price target for where XRP could end up, going by the 2017-2018 rally, the altcoin is expected to reach a new all-time high. This would mean rising to around $3 at least, which would be a 600% rally from its current price of $0.5.
Related Reading: Here’s What Volatility Says About Where Dogecoin Price Is Headed
The crypto analyst did give investors a timeframe to watch out for as the market recovers. From May 15 through to August, which is a three-month timeframe, was marked as important by the analyst, for when this rally could begin. “Don’t know target price but Shit could blow up big in this Bull Cycle up to December,” the crypto analyst stated.

Hacker Returns Nearly All of $68,000,000 Worth of Crypto Stolen From Whale Wallet: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								A hacker who managed to steal nearly $70 million in crypto from a whale has returned almost everything, according to on-chain data.
Earlier this month, a hacker successfully phished a whale using what’s known as an “address poisoning” scheme.










The scheme involves sending someone a small amount of crypto with an address that looks similar to the victim’s wallet. The tactic is designed to trick the victim into copying the bad actor’s address from their transaction history and having the crypto sent to that wallet instead.
Blockchain security firm CertiK notes that the scammer mimicked a transfer of 0.05 Ethereum (ETH), which tricked the victim into sending 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) worth $69.3 million to the wrong address. The hacker subsequently swapped the WBTC stack into 23,000 ETH.
However, after an exchange of words over Etherscan’s messaging service, the hacker appears to have been compelled to send the crypto assets back to the whale.
According to blockchain tracking firm Arkham, the hacker has returned nearly all the stolen funds in a flurry of transactions over the past several days. Arkham’s data shows that the whale has been made whole and is now holding 22,960 ETH worth $66.33 million
The hacker never made an attempt to obfuscate the stolen funds through crypto mixers or further trading.
At time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,881, down 1.43% in the last 24 hours.

Billion-Dollar Bank Sued After Revealing Massive Data Breach Affecting Thousands of Customers, Exposing Account Details, Social Security Numbers and Medical Information: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A US lender is facing separate class action lawsuits over a security incident that exposed thousands of customers’ personal identifiable information (PII).
Plaintiffs for the lawsuits say Centennial Bank suffered a data breach in April 2023 – but they allege the lender only notified affected customers that their PII was stolen a full year later, reports consumer lawsuit-focused news site Top Class Actions.










According to Centennial Bank’s website, the data security incident happened between April 6th-7th of last year, and the lender completed its review on March 29th.
Although the bank has not released the exact number of customers affected, a mandatory data breach notification in Washington State shows 3,044 people were hit in that state alone.
The incident compromised customers’ sensitive information including full names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers, bank account numbers and health insurance details.
One lawsuit says that Centennial Bank failed to establish a robust security system to protect its customers.
“Defendant failed to adequately protect plaintiffs and class members PII – and failed to even encrypt or redact this highly sensitive information.
This unencrypted, unredacted PII was compromised due to Defendant’s intentional, reckless, negligent and/or careless acts and omissions and its utter failure to protect customers’ sensitive data.”
Local news site 104.9 The Fox reports that Centennial Bank suffered a massive system-wide shutdown amid the April 2023 incident. Customers were not able to access online banking services or use their cards to withdraw cash or pay for goods and services. At the same time, branches of the billion-dollar lender could not complete withdrawals or take in cash deposits, while auto-deducted bills were rejected. Direct deposit checks for payrolls also witnessed delays.
Centennial Bank has $22 billion in total assets with 222 physical locations across Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Texas and New York City.

                        Roaring Kitty, the pseudonym of the trader who gained fame for his role in the GameStop short squeeze of 2021, is back, and so is the rise in GME’s stock price.As if revisiting the start of 2021, markets have turned bullish with the return of this retail investor icon.Responding swiftly to the market excitement, Solana meme coin developers have capitalized on the momentum by launching and promoting various new coins, with KITTY emerging as the standout performer at the time of writing.This article will analyze KITTY’s current price trends and look to see whether an innovative new meme coin, Dogeverse, represents a more promising investment opportunity.Legendary Leader of the Wall Street Bets campaign for GameStop (GME), Roaring Kitty has returned to X (Twitter), and Solana meme markets are witnessing a major surge for name-linked tokens like GME, STONKS and, in this instance, KITTY.KITTY Price Analysis: Can Solana Meme Coin Rally Sustain After Roaring Kitty Return Hype?
As price action continues to hammer to the upside, the Roaring Kitty token is currently trading at a market price of $0.0.0366 (representing a 24-hour change of +21,247%).This comes after KITTY price roared out of capitulative price levels in a dramatic surge, triggered by Roaring Kitty’s first return to X post at around 1AM on May 13.The hours since have seen strong buy pressure (currently representing 54% of transactions) has fuelled major gains, with few signs of slowing down after a well-established support zone emerged between $0.01 and $0.02.Now in a second rally leg, KITTY is targeting a further upside move, as bulls hold strong at a shocking $27M market cap.These heights induce risk.However, a strong upside move from here could see KITTY surge to $100M superstar status – offering as much as a 4x return for investors here.Yet, with late-stage entries all that’s left, many are shifting their attention to presale tokens poised to explode in similar fashion over the weeks to come.Discover the Next Solana Meme Coin to Pump in May 2024: DOGEVERSE
While SOL offers a market leader opportunity, the biggest gains can be accrued through presale opportunities, which position investors as early birds able to capture the lion’s share of project growth—just imagine investing in KITTY before it hit the market and skyrocketed 22,000%.One such opportunity in the SOL ecosystem is the DOGEVERSE presale – which has unlocked viral success over the last two weeks to hit $15M raised in the ongoing presale.Aiming to be the first multi-chain incarnation of DOGE, DOGEVERSE is positioned to grow rapidly as market participants race to grab a piece of the pie.DOGEVERSE is still raising funds at the presale stage and will start preparing for exchange listings very soon.Buy DOGEVERSE Here

Rain exchange suffered $14.1M in suspicious outflows 2 weeks ago - ZachXBT

The Rain cryptocurrency exchange was “likely exploited” on April 29 when $14.1 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP was transferred to a new wallet under suspicious circumstances, according to a May 13 report from on-chain sleuth ZachXBT. The report comes two weeks after the reportedly suspicious transactions took place.Rain is a centralized crypto exchange headquartered in Bahrain. It specializes in serving customers from Southwest Asia and the Middle East. According to regional news site The National, Rain has recorded over $1 billion in trading volume since its inception.ZachXBT’s official Telegram channel reported that the transferred funds “were quickly transferred to instant exchanges and swapped for BTC and ETH” before being deposited to two destination addresses on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. The Ethereum address, which ends in 6c28, is currently holding approximately 1,881 ETH, worth $5.5 million at the current price. The Bitcoin address, which ends in prp2, is holding ‎137.9 BTC, worth $8.6 million at the current price.Report on suspected Rain exploit.

The d609 address, in turn, received the funds from several Bitgo multisignature wallets. Arkham has not explicitly labeled these wallets as belonging to Rain.On April 29, these Bitgo wallets posted 26 separate transactions, sending ETH and a variety of tokens to the address ending in d609. More than 590 ETH ($1.7 million at the current price) was sent, as well as approximately 20 billion Shiba Inu ($481,000),12,500 Chainlink ($169,000), $240,000 Tether (USDT), and $500,000 USD Coin (USDC).BitGo wallets suspicious outflows.

New Hampshire representative proposes Bitcoin ETF investment to address state financial liabilities

New Hampshire State Representative Keith Ammon discussed the potential benefits of the state diversifying its financial reserves into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a May 12 social media post.The SEC approved trading spot Bitcoin ETFs on US exchanges in January. Since then, the products have generated huge interest, with major financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, trading firm Susquehanna International Group, and others revealing substantial holdings in these ETFs.6200% ROIAmmon highlighted a hypothetical scenario where if the state had invested 5% of its rainy day fund into Bitcoin in 2016, the initial $4.65 million investment could have grown to approximately $473 million, marking a remarkable 10,000% profit.Nevertheless, the state missed this significant ROI opportunity because it failed to invest in the top digital asset.However, Ammon noted that the state could right that wrong and gain a remarkable 6,200% return on investment by allocating just 5% of its $290 million rainy day fund to a Bitcoin ETF now and holding it until 2030.His projection stems from insights by influential figures in the crypto space, such as Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, who anticipates a significant upsurge in Bitcoin’s value. Wood proposes that if institutions dedicate 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, its price could skyrocket to $3.8 million by 2030.Moreover, Ammon references Manuel Nordeste, Fidelity’s Vice President of Digital Assets, who recently highlighted the increasing inclination of major pension funds and prominent banks toward incorporating Bitcoin ETFs into their portfolios.Ammon also points out that a substantial portion of pension managers—25% to be precise—revealed personal ownership of digital assets during a recent panel. He noted:“If just 1% of state pension AUM ($5.5T) flowed into BTC, it would dwarf mining revenue, leading to a supply shortage relative to demand and a price increase for Bitcoin.”Considering these insights, Ammon posits that Bitcoin exposure could alleviate New Hampshire’s financial burdens. He said:“The State of New Hampshire has outstanding liabilities to the state pension system of $1.25 billion and for bonds of around $200 million. How could we climb out of that hole? The answer may be staring us in the face, and it’s worthy of further investigation.”Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Bitcoin bottomed at $56K? BTC price chart hints at breakout within days

A popular Bitcoin chart formation suggests that Bitcoin's (BTC) price could break out from its current range. However, this week's macroeconomic news could also significantly impact the price. Can Bitcoin break out to the upside?Is a Bitcoin breakout imminent?On the four-hour chart, Bitcoin price printed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a formation used by technical analysts to predict the reversal of a previous downtrend.Based on the technical formation, Bitcoin could rally to the upside if a break above the trendline occurs, according to a May 13 X post from crypto investor Quinten Francois, who wrote: “Inverse head and shoulders pattern spotted on the $BTC chart. Not the most beautiful iH&S I've ever seen, but I'll take it. Different ways to draw the neckline too, but this way makes the most sense to me. Break the neckline for further price recovery!”Source: Quinten FrancoisBitcoin has nearly reset some key technical indicators, including the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), an indicator used to gauge changes in the strength and direction of an asset. This could mean more upward momentum according to pseudonymous crypto analyst Jelle, who wrote in a May 13 X post:“Bitcoin has nearly completed a full reset. Back to the 100-day EMA, a bullish MACD cross (below the zero line) -- and the first higher low in a long time. It's looking good.”Source: JelleOver on the daily chart, Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) stood at 49, up from 33 on May 1, suggesting that BTC price is currently at fair value. The RSI is a popular momentum indicator used to measure whether an asset is oversold or overbought based on the magnitude of recent price changes.BTC/USDT, 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewIn line with the previous prediction, pseudonymous crypto trader Mags also expects a price breakout, based on key technical indicators, according to a chart shared in a May 13 X post with his 74,200 followers:Source: MagsDespite the bullish chart formation, the sentiment around Bitcoin is still in a precarious situation. Particularly, this week's macroeconomic developments, especially the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on May 14, could significantly impact its short-term price trajectory, according to Matt Bell, the CEO of Turbofish. Bell told Cointelegraph:"While the 4-hour chart hints at a potential trend reversal with the Inverse Head and Shoulders formation, it’s crucial to note that Bitcoin’s price action is tightly bound within a narrow trading range... Factors like United States macro data and insights from Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, could introduce a new wave of volatility to the crypto market."Related: Did XRP price just bottom against Bitcoin?Bitcoin at $56K marked local bottom: analystBitcoin’s retrace to $56,000 has likely marked the local price bottom, according to popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital, who wrote in a May 13 X post:“If $56,000 was not the bottom then this current pullback will have officially equaled the longest retrace in this cycle at 63 days. History however suggests that this current pullback ended at $56,000 and 47 days.”Source: Rekt CapitalWhat's more, Bitcoin’s distribution danger zone ended on May 6, as Bitcoin rose above the $65,000 mark.However, Bitcoin faces significant resistance around the $63,500 and $63,700.

Founder and chairman of MicroStrategy Michael Saylor has sent an important Bitcoin message to the crypto community, citing the legendary Terminator dilogy.Saylor was the one who initiated the current Bitcoin course taken by MicroStrategy when it started buying BTC on a regular basis in the August of 2020. A few years ago, he stepped down from his CEO position to focus on the Bitcoin strategy for the company.Several times a day, Saylor publishes Bitcoin-related posts on the X platform with a short message to the BTC community and an AI-generated image. This time, his message was related to the original Terminator movies directed by James Cameron and their Sarah Connor character in particular."Terminator" Bitcoin call to communitySaylor published a picture of a young woman who looks like Sarah Connor – generated by an AI app. She has a Bitcoin mascot on her tank top and the famous phrase “No fate” that Kyle Reese passed to her from John Connor from 2029 in the first Terminator movie.

The US dollar is bound to crash, the writer and investor believes. Therefore, he recommends his followers on X to buy Bitcoin, gold and silver to protect themselves from that USD crash.Kiyosaki is famous for his predictions, expecting the US economy and the dollar to collapse soon.

GameStop Tribute Meme Coin on Solana Surges 1,900% as GME Fever Returns - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIs the meme stock craze back? GameStop’s share price doubled from Friday’s close to Monday’s open, with trading of GME paused nine times already due to volatility. And a GameStop-themed meme coin on Solana is reaping the rewards, too.The “GameStop” token on Solana, which also uses the GME ticker, has seen a 1,900% price jump over the past 24 hours, per data from DexScreener, to a current price of approximately $0.01. That gives GME a current market cap of $68 million.GME on Solana, which is an unofficial meme coin created as a tribute to the company, was launched in January shortly after the gaming retailer announced that it would withdraw from the crypto world, shutting down its NFT marketplace that launched back in 2022.Like most meme coins, GME had a short and extremely volatile moment in the spotlight. Meme coins are often created based on internet memes and pop culture trends, but they’re also often created by anonymous developers—and may be “rug pulled,” or have the liquidity drained, leaving buyers with a near-worthless token.The GME token rose to a high price of $0.0135 in early February, and swung up and down for weeks before eventually losing steam and sinking lower and lower. GME had barely budged in price for weeks, and was trading for about $0.0005 just before the latest surge.The unofficial GameStop token still remains about 26% down from its all-time high price, but is closer to that mark than it’s been in three months. And the 24-hour jump of about 1,900% is vastly higher than that of the actual GameStop stock price.Stock trader Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty and DeepFuckingValue, helped drive an enormous surge in the price of GameStop’s shares in early 2021 via Reddit posts and livestreams, encouraging traders to purchase and hold the diminished shares of the retail giant. The trend then spread to other nostalgic, beleaguered brands, like movie theater chain AMC.The original craze eventually died down, but a revival appears to be in the offing following a Twitter (aka X) post from Gill on Sunday—the first in nearly three years. GME more than doubled from its close price on Friday, while AMC jumped 37%. Adjacent stocks like Reddit (up 9%) and Robinhood (up 6%) are also rising alongside them.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests a potential bullish surge for Shiba Inu (SHIB), the meme-inspired cryptocurrency, predicting a 20% upswing if it manages to breach the upper boundary of a descending parallel channel at $0.00002444. Martinez's analysis, depicted in a chart attached to the post, indicates SHIB's trajectory aiming at surpassing this crucial resistance level.Today's cryptocurrency market saw a notable uptick, particularly for meme-based digital assets. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the meme cryptocurrency sector experienced a significant 5.56% surge in capitalization, amounting to a staggering $52.94 billion. Trading volumes for the meme-inspired tokens surged by over 118%, underscoring the heightened interest and activity within this niche.Source: Ali MartinezLeading the charge alongside SHIB are other meme coins like Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE). This surge in meme coin activity coincides with the resurgence of interest in the crypto space, possibly fueled by the return of Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill to the limelight. "Roaring Kitty" is backGill, notable for his involvement in the GameStop (GME) stock short-squeeze saga in 2021, has once again become a prominent figure in financial discussions.  A former financial advisor and investor, Gill became widely known for his bullish stance toward GameStop. His enthusiastic and persuasive posts attracted a large following in the online trading community, influencing many retail investors to buy shares of GameStop, creating a sort of cult.While SHIB stands out among its meme coin counterparts, Martinez's forecast injects a renewed sense of optimism into its trajectory. The potential 20% upswing, contingent upon breaching the resistance level, could herald a significant bullish trend for the SHIB community.

Dogecoin Gets 62% Boost on Derivatives as Bulls Regain Control - DailyCoin


        
Dogecoin approaches $0.15, tacking on a high price correlation with Bitcoin.



DOGE’s daily volume on Derivatives nears $2 billion amid reiterated interest.



The top dog meme coin faces stiff competition from PEPE coin on Derivatives.
Dogecoin (DOGE) embarked on a micro rally to start the week, clinging 3%  to briefly approach $0.15 resistance. However, these gains have yet to provide the strength needed for DOGE to soar above $0.15.Can Bulls Spurt DOGE Back to $0.20?This particular price barrier is crucial for DOGE to clear on the way up, as 11.35B DOGE coins are held in 261.78K cryptocurrency addresses at an average price of $0.142. If Dogecoin surges past this support cluster, the next barrier between $0.149 and $0.181 consists of 13.31B Dogecoins split between 340.45K crypto addresses.Judging from the volume held at the aforementioned price barriers, Dogecoin’s $0.20 price target could come into play if it continues to highly correlate with Bitcoin (BTC) and no extra sell pressure arrives. At the current Dogecoin price levels, the DOGE combined order book is favorable for crypto bulls, with $82 million in DOGE bids over the past 24 hours compared to $76 million in completed DOGE 24-hour sales.DOGE Banks on the Rapid Hike in DerivativesAlongside the high price correlation of 0.9 with BTC, another upside for Dogecoin is the 62% upswing in Derivatives trade volume. As depicted in the graph below, Dogecoin’s Derivatives market trading volume is nearing $2 billion, as both long and short DOGE traders partook in position placements that boosted the Open Interest (OI) rate by 4.86% over the past 24 hours.While the general long versus short DOGE position ratio is slightly on the short-selling side, it shall be noted that OKX customers are the most bullish on DOGE, on a 3.61 ratio between long and short positions. Secondly, long Dogecoin Derivatives traders on Binance outsource the short-sells more than twice, at a 2.0452 ratio based on DOGE positions.While Dogecoin couldn’t gain the same popularity on Spot markets this Monday, the overall DOGE trading volume on Spot still exceeded $1 billion. DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) dwells around 50, which means that DOGE is neither in an oversold nor an overbought condition. Finally, a positive Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) index above 0.10 shows a renewed interest in trading the token on Spot markets.On the Flipside
While Dogecoin is the clear leader by global market cap in the meme coin department, Pepe Coin (PEPE) challenges its popularity in derivatives.



According to the real-time on-chain data by CoinGlass, PEPE’s trading volume on Derivatives has breached $2B with a positive long versus short ratio at 1.0259.
Why This MattersDogecoin’s status as the second largest Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain aside from Bitcoin (BTC) puts the original memecoin at the top of the list of the most talked-about alternative currencies.

Will the Law to Determine the Fate of Cryptocurrencies in the US Pass? Is It Favorable for the Sector? - Bitcoin Sistemi

TD Cowen, one of the leading investment banks in the USA, recently shed light on the future of the Financial Innovation and Technology Act for the 21st Century (FIT21), a comprehensive crypto market structure bill. Although the bill has a slim chance of becoming law in the current Congress, it is seen as a critical cornerstone for future legislative efforts.
The Republican-led FIT21 bill will be voted on in the House of Representatives at the end of the month. The bill proposes a comprehensive approach to regulating the emerging crypto market and aims to impose greater regulatory responsibility on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC is described as a softer regulator for cryptocurrencies.


But TD Cowen's Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg, warns against getting caught up in the details of this legislation. “There is no chance of it becoming law in this Congress,” they wrote in a memo. The group cites the Senate Banking's lack of preparatory work and Democrats' focus on investor protections as the main reasons for this.
Despite these obstacles, TD Cowen sees FIT21 as a critical cornerstone for Congress when a new effort to enact crypto market structure legislation is expected in 2025/2026. The bill brings together members of the House of Representatives and shifts the focus to the Senate, allowing it to introduce its own bill.





The FIT21 vote could also shed light on how Democrats and Republicans view critical issues like anti-money laundering and investor protections. TD Cowen expects FIT21 to pass the full House.
FIT21, which passed the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee last summer, faces a tougher challenge than a bill regulating stablecoins. Announcing the vote on FIT21, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry called the bill a bipartisan effort “to finally provide clarity.”



Former President Donald Trump recently expressed his support for crypto. However, it is unclear whether he will maintain this pro-crypto stance if he wins the presidential election later this year.
TD Cowen notes that Trump could be a “problem” in the future. They believe Trump risks further polarizing crypto oversight, which could make it harder to find bipartisan consensus. “We will monitor this closely,” the investment bank concluded.

Is Bitcoin A 90% Surge Incoming? Analyst Sees Bottom As Inflation Data In Focus


								Bitcoin prices are moving sideways when writing and are generally firm. Even though there are marks of strength, the world’s most valuable coin is still swimming against ferocious downstream currents and could risk plunging below $60,000 and May 2024 lows. 
Is The Bitcoin Bear Run Over? Prices Retest The 100-Day Moving Average
Though there are risks, one analyst on X is upbeat. In a post, the trader noted that prices have retested the 100-day moving average. Historically, whenever Bitcoin has dipped to or slightly below this level, it has marked a local bottom, followed by a significant upward rally.

Looking at the daily chart, the analyst notes that the most recent instance occurred in January, where a price test of the 100-day moving average preceded a 90% surge. 
Now that prices have once more retested this level, if history guides, it is likely that Bitcoin has found a local bottom, and a bullish outcome, last seen in January 2024, could be on the offing.  

Though traders are hopeful, there is no guarantee that prices will surge as expected. As mentioned earlier, the coin remains under immense liquidation pressure, and sellers have been soaking in attempts for higher highs.

The daily chart shows local resistance and support are at $66,000 and $56,500, respectively. As prices move sideways, the trend direction established will largely depend on the breakout direction. 
A conclusive close above $66,000, buoyed by rising participation, might surge BTC prices. However, whether it will spike by 90% or higher like in the past remains to be seen.
Inflation Data: A Catalyst For Bitcoin Growth?
With traders upbeat, this week promises to be pivotal, with inflation data taking center stage. On May 14, the United States Producer Price Index (PPI) will be released. A day later, on May 15, the public will know where the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading stands. 

While economists anticipate a slight decrease in inflation compared to previous readings, volatility is expected. If inflation slows down in the United States, the greenback could weaken. Subsequently, Bitcoin may edge higher as investors seek alternatives to store value.
Inflation data versus Oil prices | Source: Analyst on X
In a post, one analyst believes falling oil prices and a robust labor market point towards an overall softening of inflation in the United States. If this trend guides, it aligns well with the expectation of lower PPI and CPI readings this week; a net bullish for BTC.

What's a BFG Token? | 100% Project’s Revenue for BFG Support



                    

Countless tokens appear in the crypto world nowadays. However, only some cryptocurrencies effectively combine earning opportunities and strategic vision for strengthening a token from the inside. Such projects build long-term prospects for token utilities and have a loyal community of holders. 



The BFG token can be classified as one of these tokens. It has taken on these qualities and shown clear tokenomics, aligning with the idea of sharing revenue with users in both the project and the token.




This article will reveal the primary BFG utilities, exclusive benefits for its holders, and token price prediction. We will also share how the BetFury project allocates 100% of its revenue to sustain the BFG token.



What is a BFG Token?



BFG is a native token of the BetFury ecosystem, launched on a BSC Chain (BEP-20) in June 2021. It has over 67,000 holders who use BFG for trading, gaming, sports betting, getting passive income from staking, etc. More about BFG: https://betfury.com/about-bfg. 



BFG has become integral to the BetFury project, constantly moving towards new achievements. It plays a vital role in the ecosystem and rises in market value due to the robust deflationary strategy. One of the fundamental points of this strategy is the direction of GGR (Gross Gaming Revenue) to the BFG Staking pool, the main crypto utility.Do you know other projects that spend 100% of the team’s revenue to support the native token? Moreover, BetFury seasons it with permanent BFG buybacks that positively affect the BFG price. Therefore, having stable revenue, the platform spends it on token development and its long-term perspective.




History Behind BFG Growth



The BFG token was launched to distribute the platform revenue and passive income to its owners. Gradually, as the project scaled, the number of collaborations increased, providing additional utilities for the BFG token, including exchange options and additional income opportunities for users.Tokens were mined by playing in a one-to-one ratio for the user and team. After the end of BFG mining in June 2023, the total supply amounted to 5 billion tokens. Simultaneously with the mining process, the primary utility of the BFG token was launched – revenue share. Users who became BFG holders began to participate in this distribution mechanism. After listing on top exchanges like PancakeSwap, BFG increased its liquidity and market circulation, taking a well-deserved place among the most popular tokens in the crypto-iGaming niche.



Strategic BFG Deflationary Mechanism



After the end of BFG mining, BetFury took on the most critical mission – escalating the value of BFG. Stable and healthy tokenomics allowed the team to create a new deflationary strategy to accomplish this task. The new deflationary mechanism involves repurchasing tokens from the market using the BetFury team’s revenue. 



BFG Buyback & Burn Mechanism



The team uses funds from the platform’s revenue streams to buy back BFG tokens from the market and conduct a monthly BFG token burn, reducing the circulating supply. These revenue streams include:




crypto staking penalty fee;



crypto swap fee;



borrowing liquidation and fee;



Futures fee



staked BFG by the BetFury team;




BFG Buyback & Lock



Each month, BetFury’s team buys back tokens from the circulating supply using funds generated from the mentioned revenue streams and stores them in a dedicated wallet known as the Treasury. Periodically, these repurchased BFG tokens will be distributed as incentives to stBFG/BFG holders and active platform users. 




This transparent and innovative deflationary strategy demonstrates that the BetFury team will focus all its efforts on boosting the token and supporting BFG holders.



How to Earn with BFG?



BFG has many utilities that reveal the token’s full range of usefulness.



Staking BFG



It’s the primary tool for passive earning. BetFury offers BFG Staking with an opportunity to double rewards by converting BFG to stBFG (a special native token) with zero fees. It provides up to 70% APY and daily payouts in BTC, ETH, BNB, USDT, and TRX.According to the mechanism for replenishing the BFG Staking pool, the part of GGR is distributed among BFG and stBFG holders in the BFG Staking pool. This way, the BetFury team can consistently support the pool’s profitability for users by providing a high APY. Additionally, the BetFury team has locked 1 billion BFG tokens for three years, opting not to benefit from the x2 APY but to earn from a regular APY in the BFG Staking pool. Such a lock ensures the team’s serious commitment to token development and its deflationary model.



Trading BFG



Everyone can trade assets on BetFury using Crypto Swap. It’s an internal exchange that provides fast transactions and low fees. Besides, you can trade BFG on top exchanges like Pancake Swap, Biswap, etc.



Holding BFG tokens



By holding a BFG token, you also gain benefits: 




High passive income from BFG staking;



Access to exclusive features and bonuses on BetFury;



Potential to get the high-value token thanks to strategic deflation mechanism and smart tokenomics (link);



Additional huge rewards for all holders are available in different formats.




Playing BFG



BetFury has over 8,000 slots and 20 Original games. Therefore, players can easily place bets and multiply their BFG assets.



Betting BFG in Sports



The platform offers over 80 sports betting options in BFG. Users also can get beneficial bonuses by placing BFG bets.



BFG Bonuses & Events



BetFury has a profitable Welcome Pack with up to a $10,500 Deposit bonus and 225 Free Spins. Moreover, each user can receive pleasant bonuses for activity and participate in various large-scale events with huge rewards:




Rise your Rank on BetFury to receive up to 25% Cashback in BFG;



Loot fantastic Rakeback and Weekly & Monthly Bonuses from Rank 1;



Get the BFG tokens during Coindrop, Rain, etc;



Choose great Bonus Packs in your Bonus Cabinet;



Join regular battles, events, and tournaments to multiply BFG;



Gather Weekly and Monthly Bonuses in BFG based on your wager and lost deposit funds between accrual periods;



Be an active VIP user to earn BFG regularly;



Receive a boosted TG Monthly Bonus in BFG after connecting the BetFury Telegram Bot to your account.




The different uses of the BFG token help it stay strong in changing markets, and its strategy of reducing supply makes it more valuable over time.



Is the BFG token secure?



BFG got a CertiK certification on September 17, 2021. This report showed the token’s reliability and security. Moreover, BetFury also received a Curacao gaming license. As a result, the platform gained users’ trust and assured all BFG holders.



BFG Token Price Prediction



According to Coincodex forecasts, the BFG price may increase by 228% and reach $0.0567 by June 6, 2024. Based on historical cycles, the platform also determined the minimum and maximum value of the token for 2025: $0.017284 and $0.081670. The upgraded tokenomics and deflationary strategy can support these positive dynamics. Therefore, such predictions have a good chance of coming true. In any case, remember that the crypto market is very volatile. Experienced traders should keep their finger on the pulse and always conduct their own research.



Conclusion



Ecosystem upgrades are essential for any crypto platform competing for a leading position in the industry. That is why BetFury has updated its tokenomics and introduced a new transparent deflationary model to empower its BFG token. The platform has directed 100% of iGaming revenue to support BFG tokens in the BFG Staking pool, thus granting users favorable conditions and stable APY rewards. The other part of the non-iGaming income will be used for BFG buybacks to fill the Burning and Treasury funds. As an outcome, the BetFury team is committed to fostering a healthy token economy and facilitating the continuous growth of the ecosystem.

Big Brother surveillance dystopia is now reality at Binance


When Binance agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), it agreed to allow two government agencies to appoint compliance monitors within the company.
As a result, Binance agreed to let the DoJ monitor its operations for three years and FinCEN for five.
After a lengthy bidding process, the DoJ picked Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA) to operate its monitorship while, according to Bloomberg, law firm Sullivan & Cromwell will likely fulfill FinCEN’s.
Never before in the history of Binance has such an expansive surveillance apparatus existed. Indeed, as the world’s largest crypto exchange and hub for tens of millions of crypto traders around the world, these DoJ and FinCEN monitorships are arguably the most powerful and comprehensive government surveillance operations in the history of crypto.
US crypto surveillance backend for almost all crypto trades
For the first time in crypto’s 15-year history, the US government has workers installed within the world’s largest operating crypto exchange. It’s a leap in surveillance by orders of magnitude. The increased power above its prior data sources — such as one-off historical subpoenas, widely neglected suspicious activity reports, or Chainalysis blockchain analytics — cannot be overstated.
According to Binance’s sworn settlement, it must provide FRA, as DoJ’s authorized contractor, access to “all information, documents, records, facilities, and employees, as reasonably requested,” including “direct observation of selected systems and procedures of the company, including those related to know-your-customer, customer due diligence, US sanctions screening, real-time transaction monitoring, law enforcement notifications, internal accounting controls, record-keeping, and internal audit procedures.”
Monitorships probably explain CZ’s prison getaway
Given the immeasurable quantities of data to which the US government now has access — including tens of millions of people and untold criminal acts by Binance users for the next five years — it’s somewhat unsurprising that its CEO Changpeng Zhao was able to get off with such a short prison sentence.
Like Binance the company, Zhao, its founder and CEO, also pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws. However, he received only a relatively short, four-month prison sentence.
Many observers attribute the judge’s leniency in Zhao’s prison sentence to the expansive, dual monitorships to which he agreed. For the first time, the US government has guaranteed, court-enforced oversight of Binance’s global operations. According to Dennis Kelleher speaking to Law360 reporters, the monitorship plea agreement made it “preordained that he was not going to get a very serious sentence.”

All other crypto surveillance tools in distant second place
Binance is by far the world’s largest crypto exchange and for years, it has facilitated multiples of the transactions of any of its closest competitors. Therefore, from a crime-fighting perspective, these years of surveillance will prove invaluable for US law enforcement efforts against crypto-using criminals.
According to a commentator, “It means bad actors going forward need to be really careful with their operational security practices to make sure they don’t pull in funds from an address which was incidentally doxxed because of an interaction with Binance.”
Binance has not settled the SEC’s multi-billion dollar lawsuit — that litigation regarding unregistered securities continues — and the crypto giant also faces continued law enforcement abroad.

Former CEO Turned Author? Binance's CZ Teases What’s Next - DailyCoin


        

Binance Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has hinted at an upcoming adventure.



The former Binance CEO was recently sentenced to a four-month prison term.



Changpeng Zhao vowed to focus on new projects in the future.




The legal tussle involving Binance and the United States Department of Justice has recently concluded, culminating with the long-awaited sentencing of founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao. However, contrasting the broader expectation of a lengthy stay behind bars, CZ bagged a mere four-month jail time. 



With ample free time now at his disposal, the former Binance CEO may now be exploring new ventures.



Binance CZ Taps Into Author Era?



Joining in a books-themed thread initiated by Binance co-founder Yi He on May 12, Changpeng Zhao hinted at the possibility of authoring a book in the upcoming months. 




Zhao, who has been spending more time on social media since his sentencing, cheekily responded to X user Omobola Oduntan’s tweet, which expressed anticipation of the former Binance CEO’s book. “I got some “quiet time” coming up. Will use that to write something,” he stated.







The former Binance CEO’s words follow his post-sentencing vow to focus on more educative ventures following his legal challenges, including establishing a learning platform for young underprivileged students to access free basic education.



While CZ’s statements were lighthearted, Yi He co-signed his message, hinting at the details the potential book will cover.



Changpeng Zhao’s Memoir-y Lane?



Despite CZ’s recent history being marked by rocky regulatory challenges, he undoubtedly remains an influential figure in the crypto industry.




From humble beginnings in Jiangsu Province to founding Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Zhao’s journey to success is an inspiring tale that solidifies his status as one of the crypto industry’s heroes.



If he does write a book, Zhao could offer insights into his journey to becoming one of the most influential figures in crypto, valued at approximately $33 billion. Additionally, CZ’s book may provide valuable guidance to aspiring industry leaders on navigating regulatory challenges by drawing insights from real-life experiences.



Zhao is arguably the third most influential person in crypto after Satoshi and Vitalik, and a memoir or autobiography will likely receive a warm reception from most of the industry.



On the Flipside




While most of Zhao’s follower base has offered a warm reception, others are fixated on his regulatory woes.



CZ recently shared the launch of a non-crypto education-driven platform, Giggle Academy. 



Following the six-month tussle with the DoJ, Binance‘s global market share dropped to 55%.




Why This Matters



Changpeng Zhao’s little to no time behind bars allows him ample time to try out new ventures. If successful, writing could become his next passion, particularly in the absence of an executive role at Binance.



CZ’s exchange Binance is still embroiled in regulatory challenges in other regions.

U.S. Senators Question Justice Department's Pursuit of Crypto Mixers Such as Tornado Cash

The DOJ also argued in a court filing that FinCEN's guidance addressing crypto mixers didn't address the idea of "control," a stance that the senators' letter took issue with. In its filing from last month, the DOJ said anything that facilitates the transfer of funds would meet the legal definition of a "money transmitter," likening the wallet to a USB cable that transfers data or a frying pan that transfers heat.

Macro Events and Interest Rate Updates Impacting Crypto Market



This week’s significant macro events include notable Consumer Price Index (CPI) news. Bowman recently stated that there are no expectations for a rate cut this year, making this week’s remarks worth noting. 



Rate cuts appear to be distant, with some economies considering further interest rate hikes. The situation will continue to maintain the tight market funding status quo. 





Despite no significant crypto events impacting the market, the FTX claim and numerous hearings are worth tracking. The cryptocurrency market, especially Ethereum and other altcoins, has been weak recently.

The vision of Infinex to revolutionize DeFi

In an era where decentralized finance (DeFi) is transforming the traditional financial world, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick has launched a new platform called Infinex. 
The new project aims to further revolutionize the DeFi sector by eliminating some of its most significant barriers: wallet configuration, asset bridging, and gas fees. With this innovative initiative, Warwick intends to simplify access to and use of decentralized finance, making it more accessible to a wider audience.

Infinex’s vision to revolutionize DeFi
Infinex was born out of the need to make DeFi more inclusive and less intimidating for novice users. Currently, one of the biggest obstacles users face is the complexity of managing digital wallets and inter-chain transactions, often accompanied by high transaction fees, known as “gas fees”. 
These elements can discourage many potential users who find the existing system too complex or too expensive.
Warwick’s vision for Infinex is clear: to eliminate these complexities and create a DeFi ecosystem that is as simple as it is effective. “We want to break down the barriers that prevent many people from entering the world of decentralized finance,” Warwick stated. 
Infinex introduces various innovative features to reduce the complexity of DeFi. First and foremost, the platform promises a simplified wallet setup that can be completed with just a few clicks, eliminating the need for complicated security procedures or private key management, often seen as intimidating by new users.
Furthermore, Infinex aims to facilitate the bridging of assets between different blockchains. Traditionally, transferring assets from one network to another is a process that can be both costly and subject to delays, due to the different speeds and capacities of blockchain networks. Infinex uses proprietary technology that allows for fast and low-cost transfers, making interoperability between different blockchains a more seamless and accessible reality.
Another significant innovation of Infinex is the elimination of gas fees, which are often a major deterrent for frequent transactions or for users operating on limited budgets. Infinex has developed a mechanism that allows to manage these fees more efficiently, potentially subsidizing or completely eliminating the cost for end users.
Expected Impact on the DeFi Sector
The introduction of Infinex could have a significant impact on the DeFi sector, especially in terms of accessibility and mass adoption. By reducing the complexities and costs associated with DeFi operations, Infinex not only attracts a new segment of users but also promotes greater financial inclusion. This expanded accessibility could result in increased liquidity and transaction volume within the DeFi ecosystem, further enhancing its growth and stability.
Despite the optimism, the road to success for Infinex is not without challenges. Security remains a predominant concern, especially when simplifying processes that traditionally require rigorous security measures. Additionally, the platform will need to demonstrate its reliability and scalability in an environment that is constantly under siege from new and sophisticated cyber attacks.
In conclusion, with the launch of Infinex, Kain Warwick not only continues to consolidate his position as a leader in the field of DeFi but also paves the way for potential transformations in the way users interact with decentralized financial technologies. If Infinex manages to overcome its initial challenges, it could very well become a fundamental pillar in the increasingly inclusive and accessible architecture of decentralized finance.

More crypto AI alliances emerge following $7.5B token merger

On May 13, blockchain AI platform ChainGPT will hold the initial dex offering (IDO) of its launchpad project, Wisdomise AI, in conjunction with KuCoin and Gate.io. Wisedomise is an AI-powered crypto adviser and investment assistant that helps users learn, predict, and execute digital asset trades. Ilan Rakhmanov, CEO and Founder of ChainGPT, said that the tool allows users to use "advanced AI algorithms" for engaging in digital asset marketplaces. Wisedomise is currently targeting an IDO with a fully diluted valuation of $20 million. Meanwhile, ChainGPT uses language learning models (LLM) to build AI-powered chatbots and news aggregators and is currently valued at $236 million, based on its native token. Similarly, on May 3, web3 base layer KIP Protocol said it would partner with GPU cloud infrastructure provider Aethir to accelerate AI development on both networks. Through the collaboration, KIP would deploy its KnowledgeFi monetization system and decentralized retrieval augmented generation (dRAG) framework, used by AI models to dynamically gather information after user prompts, to Aethir. Likewise, Aethir will allow KIP Protocol to access its fleet of 40,000 GPUs and 3,000 NVIDIA H100s for generating AI prompts. Julian Peh, co-founder and CEO of KIP Protocol, stated that the two protocols are in alignment over the firm's use of Aethir's computing resources for powering its AI asset deployment and monetization tools. Last month, the three biggest players in the crypto AI industry, SingularityNet, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol, approved a $7.5 billion token merger, creating the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) project. The ASI is currently examining three distinct product pipelines: deployment of AI agents in commercial settings, neural symbolic language learning models (LLMs), and AI data sharing and utilization. “In the near term, we anticipate generating revenue as we launch the agentic network for deployment,” Humayun Sheikh, chairman of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance and CEO of Fetch.ai, told Cointelegraph in a statement. “In the short term, we’ll focus on deploying numerous commercial products that breathe life into AI applications.”Despite the hype, scammers have also begun taking advantage of unsuspecting users drawn by the crypto AI frenzy. On May 5, blockchain security firm CertiK reported that the Genius Crypto Token GNUS.ai was exploited for $1.27 million. After exploiting the developers' private wallet on Discord, an attacker allegedly created a fake GNU token on Fantom blockchain and copied the code from GNUS.ai's Ethereum Chain, thereby converting the fake GNU tokens to genuine GNUS.ai tokens on Fantom. Afterward, the attacker bridged 500,000 worth of illicitly minted GNUS.ai tokens from Fantom to Ethereum and sold them for $1.27 million. Related: OKX Ventures invests in Web3 ‘play ARPG to train AI’ game Blade of God X

On May 13, Adams warned of the potential consequences that the administration could face at the November polls.Adams expressed concerns about President Biden and other Democrats’ perceived anti-crypto position, which could reduce the incumbent US president’s likelihood of re-election.Uniswap Founder Tags US SEC as Catalyst for Biden’s Potential Loss
He advised that anyone close to President Biden or within his leadership circle “should be expressing how serious this is and pushing for immediate reversal on his approach to crypto.”This is not the first time experts will predict how Biden’s stringent crypto policies could undermine his re-election chances.Shark Tank billionaire and crypto evangelist Mark Cuban joined the long list of critics that have blasted Biden’s crypto stance as a potential election killer. He pointed to SEC chair Gary Gensler’s aggressive crackdown and lawsuits against major crypto firms as a liability to the president’s bid.Cuban believes the 2024 US presidential election will take a new turn as crypto voters will influence the outcome, limiting Biden’s chances of a second term.Since becoming president, Biden has taken a hardline stance against the crypto sector. An Executive Order was signed in 2022, which referenced Terra’s $50-billion crash and “the wave of insolvencies” as reasons to “harness” crypto potential responsibly.Ever since, influential figures such as Senator Elizabeth Warren have advocated for stringent crypto industry regulations, as she claimed in March 2024 that crypto threatens US security and helps terrorists.Additionally, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has classified nearly all cryptocurrencies as securities, further complicating regulatory clarity regarding the crypto industry amid the recent probe of Uniswap.Meanwhile, the Republican candidate in the November 2024 election has been wooing crypto community members.In a recent speech, former US President and Republican Presidential candidate in the November 2024 election, Donald Trump, expressed support for crypto, criticizing Biden for his skeptical views and accusing him of being uninformed about crypto.Uniswap Founder Asserts that 40% of US Adults Own Crypto
Hayden Adams had previously highlighted the ongoing shift in the financial sector due to the increased adoption of cryptocurrencies. He noted that 40% of adults in the US already own crypto, which could potentially threaten Biden’s election prospects given the growing influence of cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, the political tides seem to be shifting in favor of Trump. David Bailey, the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, revealed a month-long collaboration with Trump on a “comprehensive executive order.”Bailey also mentioned that other players in the crypto space are seeking to raise about $100 million to aid Trump’s campaign to ensure his return to the White House.

New Development in the Tether-XRP Conflict: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Steps Back - Bitcoin Sistemi


Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, the company behind XRP, claimed in his recent statement that the US government was going after Tether (USDT).
On the other hand, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino published a long response and said that an 'uninformed' CEO was spreading fear about USDT, referring to Garlinghouse. He also reminded that Ripple is under investigation by the SEC and intends to launch a USDT rival stablecoin.


However, Garlinghouse also said in the podcast program in which he made his controversial remarks that he saw Tether as very important for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. He added that he did not know how to predict what impact potential US regulatory action against Tether would have on the crypto ecosystem.
Garlinghouse published a response and took a step back after Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino lashed out at him.





Ripple CEO said that his intention was not to attack Tether. In addition, he also reminded that his next words in the podcast were that Tether was very important for the ecosystem.

Garlinghouse said that his statement was intended to remind that the US government demands more control over dollar-based stablecoin companies and that Tether, the largest company in this field, is also in its targets.

Bernstein Argues Bitcoin's 'Flattish' Price Action is Great for Public Miners - Benzinga

Analysts at research and brokerage firm Bernstein aren't worried about the "flattish" price action of Bitcoin BTC/USD, arguing that it can be great for miners — when economics are driven by competitive hash-rate wars. "Bitcoin price action has been flattish, but we don't fear any major drawdown here" Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote in a note to clients on Monday. "We expect Bitcoin to remain range bound (high 50Ks to low 60Ks) and break out on the upside to continue its upward adoption trajectory, as Bitcoin ETFs see allocation from RIAs, wealth platforms and other institutional funds." Bitcoin is currently trading for around $62,800, according to The Block's price page.Read the full story at The Block.Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Strong start, slowing demand: The first 4 months of US spot bitcoin ETFs - Blockworks


The financial world prefers quarterly reviews. But US spot bitcoin ETFs have been alive for one-third of a year, and now seems as good a time as any for a look back.  
The sample size captures bitcoin hitting a new all-time high and seeing some corrections since the Jan. 11 ETF launches.
Oh yeah, and adding a fourth month captures the demand (or lack thereof) for bitcoin ETFs after per-block rewards for mining the asset were cut in half last month.
One headline number: US spot bitcoin ETFs have notched net inflows of about $11.7 billion.
Another noteworthy stat: Those inflows occurred despite the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) enduring net outflows of $17.6 billion.
Profit-taking by ETF investors, as well as the Federal Reserve’s likely higher-rates-for-longer posturing, have resulted in a demand drop-off for BTC in recent weeks, according to analysts. Bitcoin’s price (BTC) — at roughly $63,000 Monday at 12 pm ET — is down about 6% from a month ago.
Industry watchers had said it would be hard to sustain the pace of some of the most successful ETF launches of all time.
Read more: Macro headwinds could spur a ‘boring’ bitcoin summer — or something worse
The category’s inflow total once stood above $12.5 billion before a month-plus of outflows brought the category back down to Earth.
Net money exiting the funds over the last five weeks (since April 8) stands at $931 million, according to Farside Investors data. Last week’s positive flows of $117 million broke a four-week bleeding streak. 
Crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) volumes — the majority of which come from US spot bitcoin ETFs — have continued to slide, CoinShares research head James Butterfill wrote in a Monday report.The offerings saw volumes of roughly $8 billion last week, compared to the $17 billion average in April.“These volumes highlight ETP investors are participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present, representing 22% of total volumes on global trusted exchanges, relative to 31% last month,” Butterfill added.
Even BlackRock, Fidelity see demand slow 
Perhaps as expected, products by BlackRock and Fidelity were able to capitalize on their renowned brands and deep client networks out of the gate to attract the most investor assets.
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) so far have net inflows amounting to $15.5 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively.
Both offerings enjoyed unprecedented inflow gains for new ETFs.
FBTC saw net inflows during its first 63 days before the streak ended on April 12. The takeaway: It saw about $8 billion of net money enter the fund in those first 63 days, and just $94 million in the 21 trading days since. 
IBIT’s run lasted 71 days, before the fund notched a zero in that category on April 24.   
So, the fund’s net inflows were nearly $15.5 billion in the first 71 trading days. They are $24 million in the last 13 trading days.
BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF looked poised to pass GBTC in assets under management weeks ago. But the recent demand slowdown has kept Grayscale’s fund in the lead — at about $17.6 billion to $16.6 billion, as of market close on Friday.
IBIT’s trading volumes were roughly $3.6 billion last week, a Blockworks analysis of Yahoo Finance data shows. That gave it a daily average of $720 million, down from a nearly $1.1 billion daily volume average the week before.  
GBTC saw its lowest weekly outflow since January from May 6 to May 10, at $171 million. The fund saw its first daily net inflow, gaining $63 million on May 3. 
Read more: Bitcoin ETF snapshot: GBTC surprise helps end sector’s seven-day outflow run 
Still, like IBIT, the Grayscale fund’s daily volumes average dipped to $338 million last week, according to Yahoo Finance data — down from a daily mark of $446 million from April 29 to May 3.
Financial advisers are expected to contribute massively to future inflows, with some revealing in recent filings that they already hold millions of dollars worth of positions in various BTC funds.

Christopher Jensen, crypto research director at bitcoin ETF issuer Franklin Templeton, told Blockworks in an April interview that more institutional investors are considering including bitcoin within long-term investment portfolios.
“There are lots of platforms, there are lots of institutions that are interested and are doing work,” Jensen said at the time. “So we don’t think the flows for the ETPs are done even though they’ve cooled off in recent weeks.”

Why Bitcoin holders may need to wait a bit longer for $70K - AMBCrypto



Buying momentum on Coinbase decreased, suggesting a further decline for Bitcoin.
The negative Sharpe Ratio indicated that BTC might not produce good gains in the short term.

Bitcoin [BTC] might experience another downturn, according to signals from the Coinbase Premium Index.
This index shows the level of buying pressure among investors in the U.S.— especially as the nation has a high number of Bitcoin holders.
High premium values indicate an increase in buying pressure. On the other hand, a low reading of the Coinbase Premium Index suggests a surge in sell-offs.
The big players are letting go
According to AMBCrypto’s analysis using CryptoQuant, the index was -0.050 at press time. This was a sign that many U.S. Bitcoin holders were selling instead of accumulating.
Source: CryptoQuant
Signal Quant, a wallet profiler and author on CryptoQuant commented on the trend.
According to the handle, the state of this leading indicator means that Bitcoin’s price might experience another correction before a significant bounce.
“The current Coinbase Premium trend is currently positive, close to zero. So if the historical pattern repeats itself, we may have a better chance of success if we wait a bit longer and invest in the rebound after the trend turns negative.”
At press time, the price of BTC was $62,785 — a 2.94% increase in the last 24 hours. Coming from the analysis above, this price increase might not last long.
But if users in the U.S. start to buy in large numbers, this bearish outlook might be invalidated. However, AMBCrypto considered other metrics to confirm it a rise beyond Bitcoin’s current peak could take more time.
Risky season is here
To do this, we looked at the Sharpe Ratio. In simple terms, this metric tells you whether to take a risk with an investment or not.
If the Sharpe Ratio is positive, it means that the potential Return On Investment (ROI) might be great compared to the risk involved.
Furthermore, a negative Sharpe Ratio indicates that the possible reward might not be worth the risk. This was the case with Bitcoin, as blockchain analytics tool Messari showed that the reading was -2.22.
Source: Messari
However, returns for BTC might start to rise once the metric rises to the zero midpoint. In the meantime, Bitcoin’s total supply in profits was 87.03%.
For a significant bounce to occur, the percentage might need to decrease. And a reasonable point for it to drop to could be 78.20%. This was the same profit supply Bitcoin had before it rallied back in March.
If the supply declines to a similar level, BTC might begin a run that could take it above $75,000.

In addition, the one-day circulation was down to 17,600, indicating that the number of coins engaged in transactions has decreased.
Should the circulation increase, Bitcoin might begin another trip down the charts.

Hyperinflation Warning: US Bizman, Author Tells Businesses To Stack Bitcoin


								Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the bestselling personal finance book “Rich Dad, Poor Dad,” has fired another financial warning shot, this time targeting the US dollar and a potential challenger – a gold-backed stablecoin from the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).

Kiyosaki, a longtime advocate for “real money” like gold, silver, and Bitcoin, fears the BRICScoin could trigger hyperinflation in the US, causing the dollar to lose its global dominance and ultimately collapse.
Hyperinflation Or Hyperbole?
While Kiyosaki paints a stark picture of a dollar deluge flooding the US economy, experts remain divided on the BRICScoin’s true impact. The very existence of the stablecoin is still under discussion within the BRICS alliance.
If it does materialize, its primary purpose would likely be to facilitate internal trade between member countries, potentially reducing their dependence on the US dollar for international transactions.


This shift could undoubtedly chip away at the dollar’s global hegemony, but financial experts are more cautious than Kiyosaki when it comes to predicting hyperinflation. The US economy, despite its challenges, still holds significant weight. A complete dollar collapse seems unlikely in the immediate future.
On Hyperinflation And Stablecoins
So, what exactly is a BRICScoin, and why does Kiyosaki fear it so much? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to a real-world asset, like gold, to prevent the wild price fluctuations often associated with traditional cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $62.584. Chart: TradingView
A gold-backed BRICScoin would theoretically offer stability and potentially challenge the dominance of the US dollar in international trade, particularly for commodities like oil currently priced in dollars.
Kiyosaki: A Prophet Or Provocateur?
Kiyosaki is no stranger to bold financial predictions. While his “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” series has sold millions of copies, some of his past forecasts haven’t materialized.
His dire warnings about the US dollar and hyperinflation should be taken with a grain of salt, especially considering his vested interest in promoting alternative assets like gold and Bitcoin.
Beyond The Hype: Building A Resilient Portfolio

The BRICS stablecoin, if it materializes, is unlikely to be an overnight revolution. But it could signal a shift in the global financial landscape. The US, facing a potential erosion of its dollar dominance, might have to focus on strengthening its own economic fundamentals.

Uniswap CEO warns US President to reverse course on crypto policies

Hayden Adams, the founder and CEO of decentralized exchange Uniswap, called on United States President Joe Biden to consider how voters think about crypto when they enter ballot boxes in November.In a May 12 X post, Adams claimed there was “not much time” for President Biden to change the perception many crypto-focused voters had of his administration’s policies on digital assets. According to the Uniswap CEO, the U.S. President was making a “miscalculation” of assuming crypto would be irrelevant in the 2024 elections and allowing Senator Elizabeth Warren and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to “wage total war” on the technology.“Republicans smell blood in the water and are turning hard towards crypto,” said Adams. “Not much time for Biden to save it. Anyone close to him or [Democratic] leadership should be expressing how serious this is and pushing for immediate reversal on his approach to crypto (public support/plan and reigning in sec + warren).”Source: Hayden AdamsIn November, U.S. voters will choose whether to elect President Biden to a second term. Since taking office in 2021, he signed one of the first executive orders to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets and nominated Gary Gensler as the SEC Chair. Under Gensler, the SEC has ramped up enforcement actions against crypto firms offering services or products to U.S. residents, resulting in many criticizing the commission for a seemingly inconsistent approach to digital assets. The regulator has civil cases pending against Kraken, Coinbase, Ripple and Binance. Related: Neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump are crypto championsOn May 8, a majority of members of the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of a resolution that would overturn an SEC rule placing restrictions on banks holding customers’ crypto. Before the vote, President Biden said he intended to veto the resolution, letting the SEC’s Special Accounting Bulletin 121 stay in place.With fewer than six months until U.S. Election Day, many in and out of the crypto space have called out the Biden administration for its policies on digital assets — some as a warning like Adams, others as a criticism. Members of Congress are also moving forward with legislation to clarify the roles the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) would play in regulating crypto.Magazine: Opinion: GOP crypto maxis almost as bad as Dems’ ‘anti-crypto army’

Bitcoin price shows strength as investors anticipate return of money printing

Bitcoin (BTC) rose by 2% in the last 24-hours, recovering after two days of difficulty in surpassing the $61,500 resistance. By sustaining price levels above $62,500, the current upside movement demonstrates that Bitcoin can still experience positive price fluctuations regardless of the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows, which saw $100 million in net outflows over four days.U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF daily flows, USD million. Source: Farside InvestorsSeveral factors have improved sentiment toward cryptocurrencies, beginning with China's announcement of issuing $138 million in long-term bonds to boost the economy. Although this was expected since the announcement in March, it reaffirmed that governments are acknowledging increased risks of recession. This was in response to data indicating that China's aggregate credit decreased in April for the first time in seven years.Zou Wang, an investment director at Shanghai Anfang Private Fund Management, told Reuters that the market now anticipates further liquidity injections from China's central bank, possibly including cuts to interest rates. Such actions would exacerbate issues stemming from recent expansive measures by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), which led to an increase in the U.S. monetary supply in March for the first time in two years.U.S. M1 monetary base, USD. Source: Fed Saint LouisAt first glance, injecting more money into the economy seems beneficial, but it can lead to higher inflation over time, especially as companies and individuals might delay spending and investment. As fixed-income investors begin to recognize that their returns are barely keeping pace with rising inflation, scarce assets like Bitcoin could become more attractive.Ultimately, investors are likely preparing for a continuous trend where governments will need to keep providing liquidity to forestall economic crises. While some might argue that the stock market would primarily benefit from this added liquidity, high interest rates adversely affect companies by raising their capital costs. Any debt issued in the past 16 years will encounter significantly higher rates upon refinancing.Last week, Fed officials hinted that interest rates might stay elevated for an extended period, according to Yahoo Finance. Minneapolis Fed Chair Neel Kashkari notably stated, "I think it’s much more likely we would just sit here for longer than we expect,” and Chicago Fed Chair Austan Goolsbee remarked, "I think now we wait." This strategy, while seemingly contradicting the push for increased liquidity, is carefully designed to delay inflationary pressures.In essence, the U.S. central bank's actions are intended to encourage more borrowing by companies and individuals to support employment and consumer markets. However, what the Fed cannot foresee is how much of this borrowed money will be spent on scarce assets to hedge against inflation, rather than stimulating the economy. It appears too early to fully evaluate such risks, but Bitcoin investors are skeptical about the Fed’s chances of achieving a soft landing.Related: Japanese listed firm adds Bitcoin as reserve asset with 117 BTCAdditionally, Bitcoin's value was influenced on May 13 by an unexpected factor: the return of social media influencer "Roaring Kitty," a former marketer who played a pivotal role in the GameStop (GME) stock rally in 2021. Having been inactive on the X social network for nearly three years, the Bitcoin community appears hopeful for some form of remarkable influence from this personality.Cryptocurrency investors anticipate a positive shift in sentiment toward digital assets, fueled by a growing distrust in banks and traditional finance, especially in light of recent government bailouts, including the rescue of Philadelphia-based Republic First Bank. These investors believe that these developments may drive more participants toward cryptocurrencies.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Crypto ETPs See First Institutional Inflows in Five Weeks, With $130,000,000 Hitting Markets: CoinShares - The Daily Hodl


								Digital assets manager CoinShares says institutions resumed investing in crypto products last week after a five-week break.
In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, CoinShares finds that digital asset investment products brought in $130 million in inflows last week after four weeks of outflows.










“Digital asset investment products saw inflows for the first time in five weeks totaling $130 million. ETP (exchange-traded product) volumes continue to subside, though, with $8 billion for the week compared to $17 billion average in April. These volumes highlight ETP investors are participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present, representing 22% of total volumes on global trusted exchanges relative to 31% last month.”
Source: CoinShares
Regionally, the US led inflows with $135 million. While Switzerland and Hong Kong also saw crypto ETP inflows of $14 million and $19 million, Canada and Germany saw outflows of $20 million and $15 million.
“Hong Kong, after a prior week of record inflows, saw just US $19 million inflows, suggesting the majority of the first-week post-Bitcoin ETF launches were seed capital.”
Bitcoin (BTC) ETPs, per usual, led crypto products with $144 million in inflows. Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), XRP and Litecoin (LTC) also enjoyed inflows of $5.9 million, $1.2 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively, Ethereum (ETH) products suffered $14.4 million in outflows.
“Low interaction by the US regulators with ETF (exchange-traded fund) issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF have increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent, this has been reflected in outflows which totaled $14 million last week.”

Tether CEO Dismisses SEC Probe Rumors as Malicious FUD - DailyCoin


        
Brad Garlinghouse warned of impending enforcement action against Tether.



Tether’s CEO wrote off the claim as fear-mongering.



Ripple is planning to launch a competing stablecoin product.
Tether has carved out a dominant position as the world’s leading stablecoin provider, with USDT boasting the highest trading volume and largest market capitalization. However, the company has faced persistent doubts over the years, particularly on the matter of its reserves being sufficient to cover all of the tokens it has issued.Playing on these doubts, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently warned that Tether is currently under investigation by US authorities. However, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has since pushed back, dismissing Garlinghouse’s claim as intentional fear-mongering and malicious misinformation from a rival.Tether is Number 1 For a Reason: ArdoinoArdoino fired back at Garlinghouse by deriding his comments as baseless fear-mongering from an “uninformed CEO,” whose own company is currently engaged in a high-profile legal battle with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).
Doubling down, the Tether chief asserted that USDT has rightly earned its status as the leading stablecoin thanks to its proven track record, solid backing from top-tier custodians, and robust compliance measures, which included respecting OFAC sanctions lists, training investigators monitoring blockchain activity, and working hand-in-hand with law enforcement agencies globally to stamp out criminality.Ardoino also emphasized USDT’s vital role in underbanked emerging markets, where millions rely on the stablecoin for spending and saving. Turning the tables, the Tether boss alleged that Garlinghouse’s alarming statements were likely motivated by Ripple launching a competing stablecoin product, with the comments being an attempt to undermine Tether’s reputation. Industry-Wide RiskGarlinghouse’s alarming statements about Tether came from a recent interview in which he expressed concerns about the impact of a US authorities’ Tether probe. The Ripple boss stated that the crypto industry has demonstrated a high degree of resilience following the imprisonment of Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao.
However, Garlinghouse warned that another “black swan” type event is inevitable, with US investigations into Tether’s operations a foreseeable event that worries him the most."The US govt is going after Tether. That is clear to me," claimed Garlinghouse. Given that Tether is deeply rooted across the crypto ecosystem, Garlinghouse expressed apprehension about the potential industry-wide impact of any major regulatory actions against the stablecoin.On the Flipside
Garlinghouse did not provide a source for his claim that the US government is coming for Tether.



The SEC has objected to Ripple‘s plans to launch a stablecoin.



Tether offers near real-time data on its circulating tokens and quarterly audited reports on its reserves.
Why This MattersTether’s persistent challenges have highlighted the stablecoin industry’s struggles to establish credibility and build public trust amid increased scrutiny. Although an SEC probe into Tether remains unconfirmed, such an investigation may be disastrous given USDT’s roots across the market.Tether set to launch smartphone to rival Google’s Android dominance.Tether’s “Pear Phone” to Battle Google as Tech Giant StrugglesEl Salvador takes government transparency to another level with new Bitcoin tracker.El Salvador Bitcoin Tracker Spearheads Govt Transparency

Tether CEO Claps Back At 'Uninformed' Ripple CEO's Criticism - Benzinga

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino on Monday targeted Ripple XRP/USD CEO Brad Garlinghouse, labeling him “an uninformed CEO” and criticizing his commentary on its stablecoin, USDT/USD, during ongoing SEC investigations and Ripple’s own stablecoin launch.What Happened: Ardoino’s tweet vehemently defended USDT’s credibility and emphasized its crucial role in global finance, especially in developing regions where traditional banking services often fail to reach the unbanked population.Ardoino used the platform to underline the stability and reliability of USDT, describing it as key for communities in unbanked regions.He pointed out that USDT serves as both a transactional and a savings medium, providing essential financial services where conventional banks have not.“USDT has consistently demonstrated strong price stability, ample liquid reserves, and adherence to high compliance standards with premier custodians,” Ardoino tweeted, countering the negative portrayal of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies often seen in mainstream media. He argued that such biased reports protect traditional financial interests while overshadowing the substantial benefits that cryptocurrencies like USDT offer to global finance.Further delving into Tether’s operational practices, Ardoino highlighted the company's rigorous compliance measures, including adherence to OFAC/SDN lists and a robust internal investigation framework that utilizes advanced tools for monitoring market activities.Also Read: Arthur Hayes: ‘Major Economies To Print Even More Money’ In The Next 24 MonthsTether's proactive approach is evidenced by its collaboration with 124 law enforcement agencies globally and the use of sophisticated software from partnerships with companies like Chainalysis, he said.Ardoino noted Tether’s aggressive stance against illegal activities, having blocked over $1.3 billion related to scams and hacks, and approximately $1.6 million linked to terrorist financing. “Tether has responded to 198 law enforcement requests in the past year alone, significantly collaborating with U.S. law enforcement to block harmful transactions totaling over $639 million,” Ardoino shared, emphasizing Tether's commitment to safety and regulatory compliance.The CEO also highlighted Tether’s international cooperation, citing strong relationships with entities like Israel's NBCTF and Ukraine law enforcement. Unlike other stablecoins that often require judicial orders to act, Tether's policy allows for immediate responsive measures to threats and illegal activities.What’s Next: As discussions about cryptocurrency’s role in global finance continue to evolve, these themes will likely be explored further at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.The event will delve into the impact of regulatory actions, the role of stablecoins, and the technological advancements shaping the financial landscape, providing a platform for critical dialogue on these pressing issues.Read Next: ‘Republicans Smell Blood In The Water:’ Uniswap CEO Warns Democrats Of ‘Swing States Level Miscalculation’ On CryptoImage: Shutterstock

OpenAI Shows Off Voice Chatbot, Touts New GPT-4o AI Model - Decrypt

ChatGPT developer OpenAI today announced its latest AI model, GPT-4o—the “O” stands for “omnimodel”—during a spring product update live stream, along with a slew of product updates, including a voice chatbot.OpenAI updated its mobile apps immediately following its announcements and also launched a desktop app for ChatGPT. The company emphasized improvements to its user experience, which it says allows people to better focus on the conversations they have with ChatGPT.“For the past couple of years, we’ve been very focused on improving the intelligence of these models, and they’ve gotten pretty good,” OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati said. “But this is the first time that we are really making a huge step forward when it comes to ease of use.”The livestream emphasized a simplified and more holistic approach to generative AI. An “omnimodel”—or natively multimodal—system does everything within its core application instead of coordinating among GPT for text, GPT Vision for images, and so on.“We think it's very, very important that people have an intuitive feel for what the technology can do, so we really want to pair it with this broader understanding,” Murati said.She noted that GPT-4o will be available to both paid and free ChatGPT users, as well as users of ChatGPT’s API. Paid ChatGPT subscribers, Murati added, will continue to have access to up to five times the system capacity of free users. Everyone, she said, should be able to access OpenAI tools.”We're always finding ways to reduce that friction, and recently, we made ChatGPT available without the signup flow,” she noted. In April, OpenAI allowed users to access ChatGPT 3.5 without signing up for an account. OpenAI then showcased ChatGPT’s ability to hold a real-time casual conversation with users, demonstrating a variety of tones and emotions. The demo included ChatGPT singing, laughing, and joking with the OpenAI engineers. The company also claimed that ChatGPT can now determine a user’s emotional state using the mobile phone’s front-facing camera.A new blog post outlined the major developments announced today, leading with “much more natural human-computer interaction.”“It accepts as input any combination of text, audio, and image and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs,” the company wrote. “It can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in a conversation.”Even before today's announcements, AI and tech enthusiasts suggested a voice chatbot powered by a next-generation AI model would make the personal companions depicted in the sci-fi movie “Her” a reality—including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, in a cryptic, one-word Twitter post.Using the ChatGPT desktop application, the OpenAI engineers showed that software code could be copied into ChatGPT, allowing the engineer to chat with ChatGPT about it. In the demo, OpenAI also showcased ChatGPT’s ability to perform real-time language translations. ChatGPT was additionally shown explaining a math problem after a photo of the equation was submitted to the app.OpenAI and the broader generative AI industry have publicly committed to fight the use of their technology in the creation of AI-generated deepfakes. OpenAI acknowledged today that GPT-4o presents new safety challenges given its real-time audio and vision capabilities.“Our team has been hard at work figuring out how to build mitigations against misuse,” Murati said. “We continue to work with different stakeholders out there—from government, media, entertainment, red teamers, and civil society—to figure out how to best bring these technologies into the world.”Rumors had been circulating since the beginning of the month about OpenAI’s big announcement, ranging from the release of GPT-5, ChatGPT powering Apple’s new version of Siri, and AI-powered search ahead of Google’s anticipated announcement on May 14. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI and Apple closed a deal that would bring OpenAI’s technology to the iPhone.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to Twitter to calm the waters on Friday, tweeting, “Not GPT-5, not a search engine, but we’ve been hard at work on some new stuff we think people will love! Feels like magic to me.”Launched in 2015 by Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba, OpenAI and its wildly popular ChatGPT released in November 2022 have dominated the conversation surrounding generative AI. With close ties and investments from Microsoft, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Dall-E 3 have been integrated into Microsoft's suite of Office 365 tools and the new Copilot AI assistant.In March, Musk sued OpenAI and Altman, claiming that the AI developer had prioritized Microsoft’s commercial interests over the public good.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Andrew Tate seems confused as he dumps bitcoin to buy GameStop


Andrew Tate claims he’s cashed in a portion of his bitcoin holdings and invested the funds into GameStop following a new wave of hype around the controversial stock. However, he can’t seem to decide on a figure. 
Tate initially said he made a $50,000 investment into GameStop before changing this to half a million. He then upped the ante even more, claiming that he’d actually allotted $6 million worth of his crypto to destroy hedge funds.
The hype around GameStop was fuelled by the return of investment-focused social media personality Roaring Kitty, who helped inspire the initial GameStop rally in 2021.

When Kitty posted on X (formerly Twitter) for the first time in three years today, GameStop’s price reportedly doubled. In response, Nasdaq has halted the trading of the stock 18 times today, likely due to the sudden price swings. 
However, these swings apparently haven’t deterred Tate, who claims he’ll hold onto the stock regardless as “PERMA DONATIONS TO THE CAUSE AGAINST THE SYSTEM.” 
The controversial influencer then described the investment as a ‘spiritual battle’ and claimed that it’s about “pissing off some dork somewhere on wall street with a fucking vaccine and a tiny Johnson.”

Tate still faces legal troubles in a number of court cases, including four women in the UK suing him over alleged rape and assault and the continuation of his human trafficking case in Romania.

                        Chinese workers are showing a lack of enthusiasm towards the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC). A report on May 13 revealed that some workers who received their salaries in digital yuan (e-CNY) converted the asset into fiat currency immediately after they were paid, indicating a clear preference for physical cash over the digital alternative.Despite the Chinese government’s efforts to promote the adoption of the digital yuan, a report from the local media outlet South China Morning Post indicates that many workers are hesitant to use it in their daily transactions.Chinese Workers CBDC Concerns Leans on Lack of UtilityThe report surveyed responses from local workers and detailed the reason behind China’s slow uptake of the digital yuan.Ye Dongyan, a researcher at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, highlighted the need to balance privacy and security, which has slowed the progress of promoting the digital yuan.“Paper currency is used anonymously, but the digital yuan is different,” he said. “The boundaries between information tracking and information security protection need more deliberation.”Workers in the Chinese civil service also expressed their thoughts on the use of the CBDC.Andrew Wang, a civil servant, said he wasn’t too worried by the idea of digital cash as it was only a small part of his salary being paid in digital yuan. His wife, who receives her full salary in digital yuan, however, withdraws the full amount as regular cash the moment she’s paid due to a lack of utility with the digital currency.He explained that she couldn’t deposit the funds or buy financial products with the e-CNY wallet, which limits the use cases and makes cash a better alternative.It could be recalled that China started trials of the digital yuan in selected cities in 2019, looking for a nationwide rollout amidst fierce global competition to establish a state-backed digital currency. While no specific timeline has been announced for the national launch, the country has actively promoted the currency since the trials began.China’s Digital Yuan Recorded $250B in Processed Transactions
Yi Gang, the former governor of the People’s Bank of China, told the South China Morning Post that over $250 billion in transactions were processed using the digital yuan as of mid-2023.He highlighted that privacy was still a major issue despite the substantial volumes, however.Unlike traditional cash, which allows for anonymous transactions, digital yuan is traceable, giving the government a high level of visibility into individuals’ financial activities. The lack of privacy raises concerns about surveillance and the potential abuse of personal financial data.While Gang’s concern borders on privacy, a top Chinese law firm analyzed the anti-money laundering (AML) challenges posed by the digital yuan. It highlighted the cross-border nature of digital currency transactions, which can complicate traditional AML monitoring methods.Regardless, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world’s largest bank by total assets, revealed in its annual report that over 15 million e-CNY wallets were newly created by individuals in 2023, with an additional creation of 1.3 million wallets by business entities, while over 2.7 million businesses joined the list of those accepting the digital currency.Crypto News reported in February that over 29.16 million digital yuan wallets have been opened in Suzhou, China, as individuals and firms transacted over $416,811,390,000 worth of CBDC in 2023.The digital yuan is now utilized in various public services, including tax and social security payments, which are in addition to personal expenditures.

Bitfarms Sees Stock Dip Following CEO Termination


Bitfarms announced the termination of Geoffrey Morphy as its interim President and CEO. 
This decision came shortly after Morphy filed a lawsuit against the company, seeking $27 million in damages for claims including breach of contract and wrongful dismissal. 
Bitfarms Shares Fall Over 6%
The company has dismissed Morphy’s claims as baseless and has vowed to defend itself vigorously in the Superior Court of Ontario.
Morphy’s termination marks a tumultuous period for Bitfarms, which is currently navigating various challenges in the crypto-mining sector. The industry suffers from rising energy costs and intense competition, compounded by the recent Bitcoin halving that has significantly cut revenue from mining operations. 

As Bitfarms continues its search for a CEO, Nicolas Bonta, co-founder and chairman, has stepped in as the interim leader. The company expressed confidence that the executive search is nearing completion, with an appointment expected in the coming weeks.

“The CEO executive search is nearing completion and that the Company will be appointing a new CEO in the next several weeks,” the company wrote.

The market reacted negatively to Morphy’s firing, with Bitfarms’ shares falling over 6% on the announcement day. Such price action reflects concerns over the company’s stability and future direction, according to Javier Bastardo, Bitcoin Ambassador at Bitfinex.

“Companies in this sector must have a solid structure and know how to navigate different market conditions. However, disputes like this reduce their competitiveness, so beyond the negligible influence I believe this news will have on the industry, it raises questions about the company’s business and leadership,” Bastardo told BeInCrypto. 

Last year, Bitfarms CEO Emiliano Grodzki resigned and was replaced by Geoffrey Morphy, who was fired this year. This comes amid a disastrous year for Bitcoin miners, which caused some large companies to declare bankruptcy.

Stand With Crypto PAC launches as industry interest in campaign funding ramps up - Blockworks


There’s a new crypto Political Action Committee (PAC) on the scene. 
Coinbase-initiated nonprofit Stand With Crypto announced it is launching a new PAC Friday. 
The associated PAC, which means only individual Stand With Crypto members can contribute up to $5,000 each, plans to back “candidates who support the crypto community,” the nonprofit said on X Friday. 
Stand With Crypto, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, launched last summer as an effort to give crypto fans more access to information about policy makers and candidates, leaders said. 
“This is a grassroots, organic bottom-up effort,” Kara Calvert, Coinbase’s head of US policy, said in August 2023 when announcing the new initiative. 
“It can provide a lot of tools to people, they can learn about the members of Congress, they can access a scorecard, they can access a legislative action portal…it will really give them the tools that they need to engage with their members of Congress,” Calvert added. 
Read more from our opinion section: Only a fool would vote on crypto alone
While federal law makes contributions to the PAC tricky, companies and individuals are free to make donations to the nonprofit itself. Crypto payments operation Moonpay on Monday announced a $1 million pledge, an effort the company said was inspired by upcoming elections. 
“Today, two things are abundantly clear: This year’s election will define the future of our industry in the United States, and it is our responsibility to step up and stand alongside those organizations that want to positively advance crypto innovation for everyone,” Ivan Soto-Wright, Moonpay CEO, said in a statement Monday. 
Stand With Crypto’s PAC comes on the scene as crypto-focused Super PAC trio Defend American Jobs, Fairshake and Protect Progress continue to dish out cash. The three groups have collectively deployed $31,752,033.81 so far this calendar year, according to Federal Election Commission filings.

The PACs made a big financial push during the March Congressional primary cycle, doling out more than $10.1 million to fund advertisements against Rep. Katie Porter, the incumbent Democrat from California who ultimately lost her bid for the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s seat. 
The trio is also backing Alabama Democrat Shomari Figures, who is vying for a US House seat in November. Protect Progress donated close to $2 million during his primary campaign in March and April, filings show. 
Stand With Crypto has not yet filed contribution and disbursement forms with the FEC, but has revealed its first five endorsements: Figures; Jim Banks, a Republican running for Senate in Indiana; Jim Justice, a Republican running for Senate in West Virginia; Eddy Morales, a Democrat running to represent Oregon’s Third District; and Troy Downing, a Republican running to represent Montana’s Second District.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Pumped And Retraced After The Last Inflation Data Release - What To Expect This Month? - Benzinga

With key inflation data scheduled for release this week, Benzinga takes a look at what cryptocurrency traders predict its impact to be.What Happened: CrypNuevo predicts an aggressive market move in response to impending inflation data. He states, "I have the feeling that we’ll just push towards one direction in an aggressive way," acknowledging the possibility of being wrong in his assessment.Considering Bitcoin‘s BTC/USD recent price action, he notes the fact that range lows are acting as support after a deviation, which he considers a good sign.Another, crypto trader Kevin shares his thoughts on the current market sentiment, the impact of macroeconomic factors and potential scenarios for Bitcoin and altcoins. He sees the current Bitcoin price action as "okay" but "not great and not bad." Kevin attributes this ambiguity to the influence of macroeconomic policy and data, which could potentially sway the market in either direction. "It’s a toss-up on which way it breaks due to Macro policy and data," he notes.While the altcoins chart looks "hideous" on the daily timeframe, the weekly and higher timeframes for Total 2-3-Others still lean more bullish than bearish.He cautions, "If CPI comes in bad this week, I think Altcoins are in for a very bad time and I believe BTC will break down and we could see 50K. If it comes in better than expected I see the opposite occurring."Also Read: Bitcoin Up 3%: What Will Inflation Data And Powell Speech Bring This Week?Why It Matters: The crypto traders’ comments highlight the significant influence that macroeconomic factors, such as PPI, and CPI data, can have on the cryptocurrency market.As investors eagerly await the CPI and PPI data, the market remains in a state of uncertainty, with the potential for a sharp move in either direction. While the last three consecutive releases of inflation rates surpassed expectations, traders are awaiting the CPI report on May 15, which is forecasted (3.4%) to come in below the prior month (3.5%). The CPI index is predicted to decelerate from 0.4% to a 0.3% monthly pace.Goldman Sachs economists Manuel Abecasis and Spencer Hill predict a 1.6% rise in car insurance prices, while health insurance costs are expected to stabilize. Rent inflation has slowed to 0.37% while owner's Equivalent Rent (OER) inflation is expected to remain strong at 0.45%  Following the last inflation data (CPI) in mid-April, which saw a marginal increase in CPI data while PPI data saw a significant increase, Bitcoin traded 2.4% higher one day after the meeting, while Ethereum ETH/USD and Dogecoin DOGE/USD gained 0.71% and 0.91%, respectively. However, after the PPI data on the next day, there was a drop across the crypto board.At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $62,800, up 1.9% on the day. Ethereum and Dogecoin are up 0.1% and 6%, respectively.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class are topics expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Pumped After The Last FOMC Meeting—Will History Repeat On Wednesday?Image: Shutterstock

Ripple, XRPL Labs Eye Mass Adoption With DeRec Partnership - DailyCoin


        

Ripple and XRPL Labs have joined the DeRec Alliance.



Ripple has tipped the move to help bolster XRP and broader crypto adoption.



Ripple and XRPL Labs are joining over ten projects to standardize the crypto asset recovery system.




The crypto industry is always harping on mass adoption; however, the technology remains niche amid its complexity.



As part of efforts to make the technology more user-friendly, on January 11, 2024, the Algorand Foundation and Swirlds Labs introduced Decentralized Recovery (DeRec), a solution to simplify crypto asset recovery and interoperability backed by the DeRec Alliance, which includes several leading crypto firms working to standardize the solution across the industry. 




This Alliance has now received a significant boost from Ripple and XRPL Labs as they tip the effort to drive mass adoption for XRP and crypto.



Ripple XRPL Labs Join DeRec Alliance as Founding Members 



On May 9, Ripple and XRPL Labs announced they were joining Swirlds Labs and the Algorand Foundation as founding members of the DeRec Alliance, touting it as a step toward greater adoption of the XRP Ledger and crypto.



"The DeRec Alliance addresses one of the biggest challenges facing mainstream crypto adoption—secure and user-friendly management of private keys. Together, we can revolutionize how users manage their private keys, representing a major step forward for user security and adoption – not just for XRP Ledger users, but for everyone in crypto," RippleX Senior Vice President Markus Infanger noted.



For the uninitiated, DeRec is a system for storing and recovering sensitive information like crypto wallet private keys by breaking it into multiple pieces that are shared with a group of trusted “helpers,” such as friends or organizations. Users gather half of the shared pieces from helpers to recover the information. The DeRec Alliance, formed by multiple crypto projects, helps to standardize the process across various blockchains.



Alliance members nominate and vote for members of a Technical Oversight Committee (TOC), participate in quarterly meetings, and provide input on policy to be voted on by the elected TOC.




Per a press statement shared with DailyCoin, Ripple and XRPL Labs will serve two years on the TOC as founding members of the DeRec Alliance. On the TOC, they will provide input on the organization’s governance structure and core policies.



DeRec Another Step Closer to Industry-Wide Impact



Commenting on the importance of the Ripple and XRPL Labs membership, Algorand CTO John Woods enthused that DeRec inched closer to having an industry-wide impact with each notable partnership.



"I'm thrilled with the addition of these new members to the DeRec Alliance. As more and more influential projects join the Alliance, we reach the critical mass required for DeRec to yield its hugely positive impact on the industry," Woods noted.



The DeRec Alliance already boasts over ten members working across sectors like health and finance. These members include The HBAR Foundation, Casper Association, Acoer, BankSocial, and The Building Blocks.



On the Flipside 




The Ethereum network achieves some of the benefits DeRec does with EIP-4337.




Why This Matters



Crypto technology’s complexity continues to pose a hurdle to its mass adoption. DeRec promises to address a vital part of this problem by standardizing and simplifying the storage and recovery of crypto assets across blockchains. The recent entry of Ripple and XRPL Labs into the DeRec Alliance provides a significant boost to the project.

Crypto Price Predictions For 2024: Dogecoin To $2 And XRP To $3 | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst Kyle Chasse has given his price predictions for different crypto tokens. His price targets for Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP were eye-catching, considering the heights he expects these coins to reach. 
Dogecoin To $2 And XRP To $3
Chasse mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin will climb to $2 and XRP to $3. His prediction for Dogecoin stands out given that other crypto analysts like Altcoin Sherpa have predicted that $1 is the highest level the crypto token can attain in this bull run. As such, Chasse’s prediction undoubtedly increases expectations for the meme coin in this cycle. 

Interestingly, Chasse’s prediction for Dogecoin still feels conservative, considering that crypto analyst Kevin (formerly Yomi OG) predicted that the meme coin could rally above $3 in this bull run based on its price action in previous bull markets. Unlike Chasse and Kevin, some are still skeptical of Dogecoin even rising to just $1. 
One of them is Pav Hundal, lead analyst for Australian exchange Swyftx, who explained why Dogecoin might not reach $1, stating that some bought the meme coin at the peak of the last bull and would want to take profits as soon as Dogecoin hits a new all-time high (ATH). He believes this category of investors can add significant selling pressure, affecting Dogecoin’s journey to $1. 
Meanwhile, Chasse’s prediction of XRP rising to $2 looks more conservative than ambitious, given other price predictions for the crypto token made so far. For instance, crypto analyst Ash Crypto predicts that XRP will reach as high as $5 in the next 12 to 16 months, while crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto claims that XRP can rise as high as $20. 
Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto is the most bullish of these analysts. He predicts that XRP can climb to $27 in this bull run. Egrag noted that the price target is feasible given XRP’s parabolic run in 2017, when it saw a 61,000% gain in 280 days. 
Price Predictions For Other Crypto Tokens
Chasse also outlined his price targets for other major crypto tokens, including Bitcoin. He expects the flagship crypto to reach $150,000 at the peak of this bull run. Chasse shares a sentiment similar to that of Tom Lee, co-founder of research firm Fundstrat, who predicts that Bitcoin will surge to $150,000 by year-end. 

Meanwhile, Chasse predicts that Ethereum will climb to $9500, another conservative prediction since crypto analysts like Mikybull Crypto predict that the second-largest crypto will climb to $20,000 in this bull run. Cardano also made Chasse’s list, with the crypto analyst predicting it would rise to $7. Chasse joins a growing list of crypto analysts who have made bullish predictions for Cardano despite its unimpressive price action.

Trader Who Called May 2021 Collapse Updates Bitcoin Outlook, Says Bottom Likely In for BTC - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								A trader who accurately called the beginning of the 2021 bear market meltdown says that the low for Bitcoin (BTC) is likely already in, based on historical patterns.
Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 190,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s monthly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator has slightly contracted, which traditionally signals that a bullish trend has at least temporarily lost steam.










The MACD is a momentum indicator that traders use to spot potential points of trend reversals.
But Dave the Wave says he doesn’t think the signal suggests that BTC’s price is headed much lower, as the MACD has not ascended anywhere near the same levels as previous bull runs.
“Yes, there is a contraction on the BTC monthly histogram, with momentum slowing, but I don’t count this definitive for price going significantly lower given:
1] the MACD had not reached the height of the line
2] a maturing market
It wouldn’t at all surprise me to see something different develop, pattern-wise, over the longer time frame.”
Source: Dave the Wave/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that the monthly MACD of BTC has yet to come close to the diagonal resistance, indicating that the bull market is likely far from over.
On the weekly timeframe, the trader says that Bitcoin’s current MACD structure is reminiscent of July 2016, which was also right after the halving and just before a massive bull run.
“If I had to make a comparison of the current BTC weekly MACD to previous, I’d put it here.
Note that on the MACD cross highlighted, the price low was already in.”
Source: Dave the Wave/X
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $61,448.

Bitcoin Has Officially Left the ‘Danger Zone’ As BTC Starts Week in the Green, According to Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst believes Bitcoin (BTC) is entering into a bullish reversal phase after a post-halving correction.
The pseudonymous analyst known as Rekt Capital tells his 466,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin seems to be following a 2016 cycle pattern when Bitcoin dipped after the halving event – during the so-called ‘danger zone’ – and then soared to new all-time highs (ATHs).










He says Bitcoin now appears to have exited the historic correction period on the weekly chart after April’s halving event when miners’ rewards were cut in half.
“The post-halving Bitcoin ‘danger zone’ (purple) is officially over. And Bitcoin is celebrating with a good bounce from the re-accumulation range low support.”

The analyst believes that Bitcoin has likely already reached its cycle post-halving bottom when it touched the $56,000 mark.
 “If $56,000 was not the bottom then this current pullback will have officially equaled the longest retrace in this cycle at 63 days. History, however, suggests that this current pullback ended at $56,000 and 47 days.”

According to the analyst, key support for Bitcoin is holding around $60,000 as momentum builds to the upside, which could send BTC to $68,000 again.
“Bitcoin is showing early-stage signs of slowing down in its sell-side momentum, slowly developing a curl against the ~$60000 support. ~$60000 needs to continue to hold as it has been holding thus far for this curl to progress and eventually lift up.”

Bitcoin is trading for $62,971 at time of writing, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

CertiK discovered $5M security flaw in Wormhole bridge on Aptos

A security flaw in the Wormhole bridge on Aptos network could have resulted in $5 million worth of losses had it not been discovered, according to a social media post from blockchain security platform CertiK. The platform claimed to have discovered the bug and reported it to the Wormhole team before it could be expl. The flaw has been patched, and the bridge is no longer vulnerable.Source: CertiK.Aptos is a blockchain network that uses the MOVE programming language, which was originally developed by Facebook for the Libra project. Supporters of MOVE claim that it is a safer language to write smart contracts when compared to Ethereum’s Solidity or other alternatives.The CertiK report was posted in the form of a video. It claimed the flaw “arose from an incorrect implementation of the ‘public(friend)’ and ‘entry’ modifiers in the MOVE programming language.” The ‘public(friend)’ modifier allows a function to be called by other functions within the same module or by external accounts specified on a “friends list,” but not by other callers. On the other hand, the ‘entry’ modifier specifies that a function can be called by any external account.The bridge contained a function called ‘publish_event,” which was used to announce events such as token transfers. It was only supposed to be callable by other functions within the same module or by certain “specified external entities.” However, in the version of the bridge that CertiK studied, the function was modified by both ‘public(friend)’ and ‘entry.’ This made it possible for anyone to call ‘publish_event,” even if they were not an approved caller.Because of this flaw, an attacker could have created fake transactions that appeared to move tokens from one account to another, even though no actual tokens were being moved. These “events” could have caused the Ethereum version of the bridge to mint or unlock tokens without having any real deposits backing them on the Aptos side. As a result, the attacker could have drained up to $5 million worth of funds from the bridge, CertiK stated.CertiK informed members of the Wormhole team about the flaw on Dec 5, 2023. After investigating the report, the team developed and tested a patch to close the security loophole and informed the protocol’s Guardians of the issue. Via a multisignature vote, the Guardians approved the patch to be implemented, and the protocol’s Aptos contract was upgraded to implement the new code. Once the flaw was reported, the process of fixing it took approximately three hours, and the new version of the bridge is no longer vulnerable to this exploit.Wormhole Aptos exploit timeline. Source: CertiK.In addition to removing the ‘entry’ keyword from the publish_event function, the new patch also restricted the value of the “governor rate limits” on Aptos from $5 million to $1 million, effectively preventing withdrawals from Aptos of greater than $1 million per day. This was done to limit losses in case of a future exploit. Current usage is below $1 million per day, CertiK claimed, implying that the rate limit shouldn’t affect most users.Wormhole also performed a “retrospective analysis” to determine whether any user funds had been affected by the issue. They concluded that no funds had been illicitly transferred and that users’ balances were safe.Wormhole hasn’t always managed to catch security flaws before they are exploited. In 2022, it lost more than $321 million when a bug in the Solana part of the bridge allowed an attacker to mint unbacked tokens. However, the team later patched the bug and compensated users. In January, Wormhole reclaimed $1 billion in total value locked for the first time since the incident, showing that some users feel its security practices have improved.Related: Bugs in Gains Network fork let traders profit 900% on every trade: Report

Another New Memecoin Trend Emerged Today - A Whale Got FOMO - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to Onchain data, a trader made significant purchases and sales on the Solana network in the company's memecoin imitation, which is on the agenda today.
This token is a memecoin that has the same name as GameStop shares traded in the United States, but has no connection to the company.


Today, GameStop shares in the USA showed an incredible rise. The reason for the rise was that Keith Gill, nicknamed Roaring Kitty, one of the architects of the short squeeze on GameStop shares in 2021, returned to Twitter.
As GameStop shares rose, the memecoin called GME also recorded significant increases. GME price has climbed 1365% in the last 24 hours.





During this rise, a trader bought GME with SOL coin for $ 65 thousand after Roaring Kitty's Twitter account became active. Then, 14 hours later, he sold them for 336 thousand dollars. So this trader earned $271 thousand in just 14 hours.

On the other hand, a second whale wallet was caught by the FOMO effect of the increase in the GME token 3 months ago and bought a large amount of GME tokens by paying 408 thousand dollars. Even though the price of GME has fallen more than 90% since then, this whale never sold his assets. Today, thanks to the re-emergence of Roaring Kitty, it has compensated for its losses and has an unrealized profit of 282 thousand dollars at the time of writing this article.


However, many new memecoins emerged after their rise in GameStop. Another altcoin named GME has appeared on the Ethereum network this time. Cryptocurrency analysis platform Lookonchain, in its statement about this altcoin, found that someone who was previously aware of the project bought 34% of the total supply of the token with 17.7 thousand dollars. Analysts have warned that this whale has current assets of $1.96 million and could make a dump.

Bitcoin's bullish trend reinforced as 'danger zone' signals fade | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin is seeing a strong upward push, shaking off earlier fears of a downturn. This comes as technical signals strengthen and key indicators reset, suggesting a bright road ahead for Bitcoin’s price.Bitcoin Market Indicators and Breakout SignalsBitcoin’s price chart is showing an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a strong indicator that often predicts a reversal of a previous downward trend. Crypto investor Quinten Francois pointed out this pattern, saying, “Inverse head and shoulders pattern spotted on the $BTC chart. Not the most beautiful I’ve ever seen, but I’ll take it.” He suggests that breaking the neckline of this pattern could pave the way for further price recovery.The moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), a tool used to spot changes in the strength and direction of Bitcoin’s price, is also showing positive signs. According to crypto analyst Jelle, “Bitcoin has nearly completed a full reset. Back to the 100-day EMA, a bullish MACD cross below the zero line—and the first higher low in a long time. It’s looking good.”Current Trends and Potential MovementsAs of the latest updates, Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures whether it is overbought or oversold, stands at 49—up from 33 on May 1. This suggests that Bitcoin is currently valued fairly according to market conditions.Crypto trader Mags, following the bullish sentiment, expects a breakout based on these technical indicators. However, the broader market sentiment remains cautious. The upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report and comments from Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, might bring additional volatility, impacting Bitcoin’s short-term movements.Source: MagsRising Through ResistanceBitcoin’s trajectory faced resistance around the $63,500 and $63,700 marks. If Bitcoin pushes above $63,700, it could potentially liquidate over $516 million in cumulative leveraged short positions, providing a substantial boost to its market position.Source: TradingViewAt the same time, Bitcoin’s price has rebounded from a recent low of $56,000, which many analysts believe was the local bottom for this cycle. Rekt Capital, a well-known analyst, suggests, “If $56,000 was not the bottom then this current pullback will have officially equaled the longest retrace in this cycle at 63 days. However, history suggests that this pullback ended at $56,000 and 47 days.”Moreover, with a morning star pattern forming at the $60,000 support zone, there is a high potential for a short-term rally. The technical setup, coupled with increasing buyer interest, points to a possible bull run challenging the overhead trend line.With Bitcoin currently trading at $63,010 and seeing an intraday rise of 2.52%, the momentum is building. There’s a growing consensus among analysts that a mix of technical strength and renewed investor interest could push Bitcoin toward a new resistance level at $68,283. Conversely, should the momentum falter, we could see a drop to around $58,451, marking the lower bound of the current trading range.

Solana Overtakes Ethereum DEX Volume: Is Ethereum Slipping? - DailyCoin


        
Solana’s DEX trading volume hits $1.3 billion, briefly outpacing Ethereum.



Ethereum quickly reclaims its lead in DEX volume.



Memecoin trades spur Solana’s temporary volume boost.
Thanks to its early start and network effects, Ethereum has long been the frontrunner in decentralized finance (DeFi). However, recently, Solana has experienced its own growth in that area, fuelled by its low fees and developer-friendly environment.
Last week, Solana once again exceeded Ethereum’s volume on decentralized exchanges (DEX), leading investors to ask questions about Ethereum’s long-term outlook. Solana’s DEX Lead Over EthereumOn Friday, May 10, Solana briefly surpassed Ethereum in DEX trading volume, recording $1.3 billion compared to Ethereum’s $1.29 billion. The flipping was primarily due to increased trading activity on Solana, thanks to a renewed interest in memecoins.
https://twitter.com/degeneratenews/status/1788746606197498093
In recent months, Solana has attracted a significant community of memecoin enthusiasts. Tokens like Bonk and DogWifHat have seen increases of upwards of 1000% since their launch. As noted in a recent analysis by Franklin Templeton, memecoin airdrops have received huge attention among the community. They also generated significant wealth effects, further contributing to interest. However, despite Solana’s temporary lead in DEX volume, Ethereum quickly regained its top position by the end of the day, closing the day at $1.39 billion in volume. Conversely, Solana’s trading volume dropped to $943 million. Solana’s DEX Volume Is Not What It SeemsThis was not the first time Solana flipped Ethereum in DEX volume. The last time this happened was on April 21, when Solana’s DEX volume was $1.4 billion, compared to Ethereum’s $1.16 billion. Before that, on March 16, Solana’s DEX volume was even higher, at $3.4 billion, against Ethereum’s $2.4 billion. 
It is important to note that high network volume does not mean the same thing for Ethereum and Solana. Due to its low fees, Solana attracts a significant number of high-frequency trades, which boost its overall volume. On the other hand, Ethereum’s higher gas fees mean that its users will only trade when it is advantageous. While their DEX volume is comparable, Ethereum still holds significant dominance regarding the network’s total value locked (TVL). Currently, Ethereum has a TVL of $52 billion, dwarfing Tron’s $8 billion and BSC’s $6 billion. Solana is only in fourth place in this metric, at a TVL of $4 billion. Even if Solana were to take the first spot in either DEX or network volume for good, it would still need to come a long way before it can grow to the size of the On the Flipside
Solana has faced significant network issues in the past. Most recently, the chain has experienced network congestion, leading to a high transaction failure rate. 



The reliance on memecoins and speculative trading may not be sustainable in the long term.
Why This Matters Even if Solana is still far behind, its rise challenges Ethereum to continue improving, particularly around scalability and transaction costs, two critical areas for user experience. Read more about Solana’s prospects to take third place among blockchain networks:Here’s How Solana Can Outpace BNB and USDT: Franklin TempletonRead more about SBF’s life in prison and his legal defense: Sam Bankman-Fried Still Claims He’s Innocent From Prison

Tokenized funds could chip away at stablecoin market, Polygon exec says - Blockworks


The growth of tokenized financial products likely represents the tip of the iceberg, as the world’s biggest financial players continue to investigate the potential of blockchain technology.
This interest could lead to the proliferation of on-chain funds that might challenge the dominance of stablecoins, according to Colin Butler, Polygon Labs’ head of institutional capital.
Franklin Templeton launched its OnChain US Government Money Fund in 2021. It uses the Polygon and Stellar blockchains to process transactions and record share ownership.
BlackRock debuted its own tokenized offering — the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund — on the Ethereum Network in March. The world’s largest asset manager then led a funding round by Securitize, a firm focused on bringing physical and traditional financial assets onto the blockchain.
The BlackRock and Franklin Templeton funds had amassed $375 million and $368 million in assets under management, respectively, as of April 30.
Their future asset growth will depend on how investors use them, Butler noted.
Franklin Templeton got regulatory approval to allow institutional investors to transfer shares of its on-chain fund to other shareholders.
“What you could do is have a venture capital firm on one side sending yield-bearing digital assets to one of their crypto-native portfolio companies that don’t have banking relationships,” he said. “That’s one idea; I don’t know what sort of adoption that receives.”
Read more: A stablecoin with yield? Tokenized fund perhaps just the start for fund giant
The stablecoin market is currently sized at about $160 billion. But unlike the Franklin Templeton fund, for example, stablecoins don’t offer users a yield. 
“To the extent you can make them more permissionless and fit certain use cases, I can see these products chipping away at that existing [total addressable market], let alone the future TAM,” Butler said.
Keep reading for more excerpts from Blockworks’ interview with Butler. 

Blockworks: What sorts of conversations are financial institutions having with blockchains as they mull their presence in the tokenization space? 
Butler: Trust and credibility are the most important factors for any Wall Street transaction. The entity looking to collaborate really needs to understand that the chain doesn’t go down. 
Virtually 100% reliability is what they’re looking for, because you can’t have a transaction just kind of disappear and fall through the cracks.
When you’re a big player thinking of coming on-chain, you also have to think about future-proofing your solution. Because if you spin something up that’s kind of a sandbox or walled garden, and there’s no future connectivity, then you have a product that’s limited in scope and you’re going to have to re-engineer everything at some point.
Read more from our opinion section: The future of tokenization? Permissioned blockchains
Blockworks: How might BlackRock’s entrance into the tokenized fund space affect how others move ahead here?
Butler: They are a thought leader, a technology leader and an innovation leader, and so when they make an action there tends to be a lot of replication.
You should just assume that almost everybody in the top 20 globally [in assets under management] has a plan for blockchain adoption. I can’t tell you when those plans will be realized, but there’s only — from my personal knowledge — one or two of the top 20 that aren’t really materially invested…without a team or a roadmap.
When BlackRock comes, it accelerates the plans for all of these other players because now they know they have air cover to do it.
And each one has a different angle on it. It’s not just BlackRock did this and now everybody replicates. Everybody’s looking to do something slightly different or build on what’s been done before, because nobody wants to be the third fund to do the exact same thing.
But broadly speaking, fund tokenization on blockchain is a huge conversation at most of the large players.
Blockworks: Private markets investment firm Hamilton Lane and hedge fund manager Brevan Howard have tokenized funds on Polygon. Do you expect more where that came from?
Butler: Longer term the vision is for everybody from banks to large RIAs, and everyone in between, to distribute these tokenized assets. 
Why it’s interesting is that these assets are not available in any other format. So they’re going to go with both hands after that, because it enables a growth trajectory that they currently don’t have. 
There’s deep financial incentives for the providers of financial products and the distributors, such as banks, to participate in this new ecosystem. That’s why people are so motivated to participate and come on-chain.
Blockworks: What do you make of the latest effort by Visa, Mastercard, JPMorgan, Citigroup and others aimed at using a shared ledger technology to settle tokenized assets? 
Butler: Many of the players listed in that announcement have been working on this for so long. I would say mentally they’ve been very serious about it for the last two years, and to me, it takes about two years to get to the point of approval for production use cases at major financial institutions.
That’s why I think that while you may have seen announcements similar to this maybe two years ago, qualitatively it’s very different because of the stage that a lot of the global financial institutions are at internally.

Sens. Lummis, Wyden oppose Justice Dept. stance on Tornado Cash charges

United States Senators Cynthia Lummis and Ron Wyden have sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland voicing their concern over the Justice Department’s (DOJ’) interpretation of money transmission licensing. As the bipartisan authors indicate in a footnote, this interpretation is being applied in the case against Roman Storm, co-founder of crypto mixer Tornado Cash, who has been charged with operating an unlicensed money transmission operation and other serious crimes.Sens. Lummis and Wyden's letter to the attorney general. Source: Senator Cynthia Lummis on XThe Bank Secrecy Act and the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) clearly define money transmission as the acceptance and transmission of currency and other forms of value. Non-custodial crypto service providers do not meet the established definition of money transmitters, and the DOJ is thus acting contrary to the Treasury, muddying policy enforcement, the senators said. In their words:“Bitcoins have a clear unilateral owner at all times. At no point in the [transfer] transaction process is there uncertainty over where ownership resides. […] Custody and control are, therefore, the logical touchstone of where ‘acceptance and transmission’ occurs on Bitcoin and other crypto networks.” FinCen is the “primary interpretive authority” of money transmission registration requirements. The standard suggested by the DOJ could be applied to a broad range of services, from internet service providers that process bank transfers to the post office, the senators wrote. Crypto advocacy groups filed a joint amicus brief in April with the Southern New York District Court making a similar argument. Source: Senator Cynthia LummisLawyers for Storm filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him in March, saying Tornado Cash did not meet the definition of a money transmission business and Storm was unable to prevent sanctioned groups from using the service because it was “immutable.”Related: DOJ’s Tornado Cash arguments show ‘obvious disdain for privacy’ — LawyerProsecutors countered that Storm was accountable for operating the service and claimed he designed software to aid criminality. They said Tornado Cash was “involved the transportation and transmission of funds known to the defendant to have been derived from a criminal offense.” Storm was arrested in August on charges of sanctions violations and facilitating money laundering in addition to unlicensed money transmission. He could be punished by up to 45 years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is free on $2 million bail with travel restrictions.Magazine: Tornado Cash 2.0: The race to build safe and legal coin mixers

Andrew Tate Says He’s Cashed $500K in Bitcoin to Go ‘All In’ on GameStop - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFormer professional kickboxer turned social media provocateur Andrew Tate claims that he has cashed out $500,000 in Bitcoin to invest in GameStop and  meme coins to spite hedge funds.“There’s a hedge fund manager who, when he wakes up tomorrow morning—if GameStop opens at the current price—he’s gonna lose $13 billion dollars,” Tate said in a Twitter video. “His entire hedge fund!”His Reddit-inspired hypothesis is similar to the 2021 theory surrounding the same stock. With the return of Roaring Kitty—the internet figure who spearheaded the movement—it seems meme stock mania is in full swing.“I’m cashing half a million dollars of Bitcoin right now and I’m going all-in, maximum leverage, all-in on all these stocks,” Tate claimed. “We’re losing all the money, we are taking down Wall Street, we’re going to take them down ourselves.“I’m taking Wall Street down, watch me,” he continued. ”Fuck ‘em. Fuck ‘em all.”Tate says he doesn’t care if he loses it all—his motivation is the downfall of the unnamed hedge fund manager.The flurry of activity surrounding GME stock has more than doubled its value in the last 24 hours—prompting exchanges to halt trading at least six times on Monday—meanwhile triggering $1.4 billion in liqudiations for investors who had bet against its rise, according to Bloomberg. GME is trading for $32.50 as of writing, compared to $10 a month ago.An unofficial Solana meme coin named in honor of Game Stop has posted even more astronomical gains.Tate has since gone further, shouting out the Occupy Wall Street movement, which initially sparked the first wave of interest in meme stocks. Some investors blame hedge funds and other financial institutions for the 2008 financial crisis. Investing in stocks that will trigger hedge fund losses is one way of exacting revenge. Tate has gone on a Twitter tirade, touting GameStop stock and invoking the WallStreetBets vow that he’ll never sell his stocks, no matter the price.“This is about pissing off some dork somewhere in Wall Street with a vaccine and a tiny johnson,” Tate exclaimed in another video.This all comes amid the influencer’s trial for alleged human trafficking and rape. A couple of weeks ago, a court in Romania said that his trial can officially go ahead 10 months after Tate and his brother were charged. A few days ago, the same court extended restrictions that prevent Tate from leaving Romania for another 60 days. A trial date is yet to be set.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Unexpected Development in Cryptocurrency Regulation in Turkey: Leveraged Trading is Expected to be Banned - Bitcoin Sistemi


The bill prepared on the legal regulations and definitions of crypto assets is ready to be presented to the Parliament with its final touches. The proposal, which is expected to be presented to the Parliament this week, will ban short selling and leveraged transactions regarding crypto assets.
Crypto assets will be defined as “intangible assets” for the first time, and thus transactions can be carried out in a more transparent and reliable manner. The bill to be presented to the Parliament will harmonize the broad definition of crypto assets with the definitions of international organizations.


The authority to determine the issuance principles will be given to the Capital Markets Board (CMB). The licensing and auditing processes of trading platforms will also be managed by the CMB. Minimum operating requirements similar to financial institutions will be introduced for service providers.

All transfer transactions made on the platforms will be recorded and compliance with the regulations determined by the Financial Crimes Investigation Board (MASAK) will be ensured. Since sudden and large fluctuations may occur in the prices of crypto assets, margin transactions, short sales and leveraged transactions that increase risk will be prohibited.





It is stated that similar prohibitions and restrictions have been introduced in practices abroad. Secondary regulations will be made on investment consultancy and portfolio management and the CMB will be authorized in this regard.
Due to the risky nature of crypto asset investments, no insurance mechanism will be created for trading transactions. These transactions will be exempt from investor compensation. In the draft law, the crime of “unauthorized crypto asset service provider” is defined and penalties are foreseen for those who operate without permission from the CMB.

Bitcoin ETF Weekly Investments Grow For First Time In Over a Month - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFresh cash has started hitting Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) again after five weeks of outflows. A Monday report from European asset manager CoinShares shows $130 million entering the funds last week. CoinShares tracks all crypto funds from the U.S. to Europe and Australia. Most of last week's movements entered American funds, particularly the new spot ETFs that give traditional stock investors exposure to Bitcoin.The report added that European investors pulled $14 million out of Ethereum-related funds due to bearish sentiment surrounding the approval of an Ethereum ETF.A number of high-profile investment firms are hoping to get approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an Ethereum ETF, but experts think the regulator will drag its heels in giving such products the green light—if they're approved at all.“Low interaction by the U.S. regulators with ETF issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF have increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent,” CoinShares wrote. “This has been reflected in outflows which totalled $14 million last week.”Perhaps the best news for investors who are long on Bitcoin is that the amount of money leaving Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) last week was the lowest it has been since its conversion to an ETF in January. Since shifting from a closed-end fund model to an ETF, investors have aggressively redeemed shares to cash out of the product—either to look for a cheaper ETF or take home gains.

House overturns SEC’s anti-crypto guidance, Biden to veto: Law Decoded

The United States House of Representatives has voted to pass a bill overturning controversial Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance preventing banks from owning crypto. The House voted to pass a bipartisan bill titled H.J. Res 109, overturning the SEC’s Special Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) requiring banks to hold their customers’ crypto assets on their balance sheets, which is not the case for traditional assets such as securities.Republican Party Representative Mike Flood — who introduced the resolution — said SAB 121 was unfair for banks looking to custody crypto, as custodial assets are “always considered off-balance sheet.”However, before the vote, U.S. President Joe Biden’s office issued a statement informing lawmakers and the public that his administration plans to veto a joint resolution affecting crypto policy at the SEC if it comes to his desk.The White House said it “strongly opposes” members of the House of Representatives seeking to pass a joint resolution it claims would disrupt the SEC’s efforts “to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.” Australian Tax Office seeks data from 1.2 million crypto usersThe Australian Taxation Office (ATO) seeks personal data and transaction details from up to 1.2 million cryptocurrency exchange users for a potential crackdown on crypto tax obligations. The tax officials believe the data will help identify traders who may have failed to pay their taxes on their crypto trades. The ATO will seek personal data, including users’ date of birth, social media accounts, phone numbers, transaction-related details like wallet addresses, type of coin trades and bank account details.For Australian regulators, cryptocurrencies are taxable assets, unlike other foreign currencies. This requires traders to pay a capital gains tax on the profit from selling crypto assets.Continue readingSouth Korea’s ruling party will press for Bitcoin ETF tradingThe Democratic Party of Korea will request that the Financial Services Commission (FSC) reconsider its interpretation of the legal status of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). An unnamed official of the Democratic Party policy committee told the local paper that the party would make the request after the opening of the National Assembly in June. The opposition party was swept into power in the April elections in South Korea and holds 175 of 300 seats in the legislative body.Previously, after the approval of spot BTC ETFs in the U.S., the FSC issued a statement saying Korean securities firms could violate the Capital Markets Act by listing foreign spot ETFs.

Bitcoin ETFs Break 4-Week Outflow Sorrow with $117M Inflows - DailyCoin


        

Bitcoin ETFs have overturned their weeks-long trend of outflows.



The crypto market recorded a similar wave of inflows in signs of recovery.



The ongoing rebound suggests reignited interest in crypto funds.




The crypto market has witnessed mixed sentiment over the past weeks, marked by rollercoaster performances across assets and fluctuating interest among market participants. Negatively impacted, Bitcoin ETFs took a downward spiral of outflows, shedding over half a billion on May 2, 2024.



Now, in a reversal of fortunes, the market is displaying signs of recovery.



Bitcoin ETFs Signal Recovery



According to Farside Investors data on May 11, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. recorded a total of $116.8 million in the recently concluded week.




Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge with a dominant $111.3 million, surpassing Ark Invest’s ARKB, which saw a total of $82.8 million in inflows. FBTC and ARKB surpassed the once best-performing BlackRock’s IBIT, which continued its trend of underperformance with only $48.1 million in inflows.







In contrast, Grayscale’s GBTC reverted to its infamous lackluster performance. Despite commencing the week with a promising $67 million inflow, Grayscale ended the week on a sour note with a total of $175 million outflows.



Bitcoin ETFs such as VanEck’s HODL and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, among others, recorded minimal inflows, contributing to a total record for the week of $11.7 million. The recovery witnessed across the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market mirrors the uptick observed across global crypto investment products.



Crypto Funds Reverse Negative Trend



According to CoinShares data on Monday, May 13, the crypto market recorded $130 million in inflows in the past week. This marked the funds’ first set of recovery inflows, following an unimpressive performance that saw the market consecutively bleed for nearly five weeks




Being the primary focus, Bitcoin (BTC) pulled $144 million, followed distantly by Solana (SOL), which saw a total of $5.9 million in inpour. Litecoin, XRP, Polkadot, and other assets also closed the week with an uptick, registering a cumulative $3.2 million.



Source: CoinShares



However, the optimism didn’t extend to others, which bucked the trend with outflows. One notable loser was Ethereum (ETH), which led the negative train of approximately $23.3 million.



This brought the inflows to $130 million, marking an approximate 430% increase from the previous week’s $435 million outflow record.

Uniswap CEO: Biden's Crypto Stance Echoes Hillary's Past Errors - DailyCoin


        

Uniswap Labs CEO Hayden Adams has asserted President Joe Biden is making a deadly mistake with his handling of crypto as elections near.



According to the Uniswap founder, Republicans are already taking advantage.



Adams’ sentiments add to a chorus of opposition to the Biden administration within crypto circles.




Despite being widely seen as the home of technological innovation, the U.S. has proven rugged terrain for the crypto industry.



Amid uncertain regulations and a flurry of enforcement actions from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), several industry leaders have espoused the view that the President Joe Biden-led administration is out to stifle crypto. With the November 2024 elections approaching, the president’s recent vow to veto any legislative attempt to overturn a perceived anti-crypto accounting rule from the SEC has only strengthened these views.




According to Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, Biden’s continued alienation of the crypto industry could cause his campaign to face the same fate as Hillary Clinton’s in 2016.



“Republicans Smell Blood in the Water”



On Monday, May 13, Adams asserted that the Biden administration was underestimating the influence of crypto “both in terms of voters and money” in the coming elections. He likened it to Hillary Clinton’s failure to campaign in swing states when she ran for office in 2016.



"Hillary campaigning in red states states [sic] instead of swing states level miscalculation from Biden camp thinking crypto will be irrelevant in 2024 election and letting SEC + Warren wage total war - both in terms of voters and money," he wrote.



According to the Uniswap Labs chief, whose protocol faces the threat of enforcement from the SEC, while the Biden administration and Democratic party fumbled the ball on crypto, the Republicans were catching on.



"Republicans smell blood in the water and are turning hard towards crypto."



This sentiment comes as former President Donald Trump has increasingly pandered to the crypto community in recent weeks, noting that his campaign is now open to receiving crypto donations.




Adams noted that the Biden administration had to act fast to stand any chance of changing the tide.



"Not much time for Biden to save it. Any one [sic] close to him or dem leadership should be expressing how serious this is and pushing for immediate reversal on his approach to crypto (public support/plan and reigning in sec + warren)."



While Adams’ sentiments suggest that there may be room for redemption, several other leaders appear to have lost all hope.



Crypto Industry Leaders Rally Against Biden



In an X post on May 8, Messari Crypto founder Ryan Selkis argued that several aspects of the crypto industry will suffer if Biden is re-elected. Recently, Selkis has become an active part of the Trump campaign. On May 9, he shared the stage with the leading Republican candidate during a 60-minute Q&A at Mar-a-Lago.







Echoing Selkis’ sentiments, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson asserted that “a vote for Biden is a vote against cryptocurrencies” in a message to followers on May 8. Unlike Selkis, however, the Cardano founder has pitched his tent in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s camp.



Meanwhile, on May 10, the Coinbase-led Stand With Crypto advocacy group formed a Political Action Committee (PAC) to raise funds for crypto-friendly candidates.



On the Flipside 




Uniswap faces the threat of an enforcement action from the U.S. SEC.



An April 2023 Pew Research survey found that only 17% of Americans say they have ever invested in crypto.



Crypto industry participants should also consider the policy stances of candidates beyond crypto.




Why This Matters 



Uniswap’s Hayden Adams statements highlight crypto’s hot-button topic status in the U.S. presidential election.

Going for Gold on Blast Jackpot | Bankless


Blast has done a pretty stellar job of courting attention as a place for degens to earn big. The main way the network has accomplished this is through its native yield, as ETH and stablecoin holders can annually earn 4% and 5% respectively on Blast. The L2 also aims to make good on its reputation thanks to its ongoing Blast Points and Blast Gold program. Half of Blast’s upcoming airdrop is going to Points holders, and half to Gold holders. Note that initially, only ETH and USDB holders earned Points, and only Blast app users earned Gold. Yet with the early makings of memecoin and NFT scenes starting to rise on Blast, the L2’s team decided to offer passive token and NFT holders a way to rack up Gold rewards, too.Here, cue in Blast Jackpot. The Blast Jackpot is a recently launched game that periodically rewards token and NFT holders on Blast. Every block mined on the network has a basic chance to trigger a jackpot, and when this happens, a random token or NFT is selected as the winner. Everyone who entered the winning asset will receive a cut of the latest Gold prize pool. The odds of selection favor tokens over NFTs, but all assets on the platform, except for WETH and USDB, are eligible.The initiative gets Blast users to diversify their holding on the network for a chance at the jackpot.If you’re interested in trying it out, entering is straightforward, but you will need to onboard to the Blast Airdrop dashboard first if you haven’t already. If you need an invite code, dozens of users have dropped theirs as comments in the Blast “Referral Link” quest in our Airdrop Hunter hub!Once you’re set up on Blast, transfer some ETH in through the native bridge or a fast 3rd-party bridge like Relay, and then you’ll be ready to start acquiring assets so you can enter into Blast Jackpot. For example, I recently joined by acquiring some of the $PAC memecoin on Thruster, a decentralized exchange, and some Skellies NFTs on the NFT orderbook platform Mintify. Once you have whichever assets you want ready in your wallet, just head to the Blast Jackpot page, scroll down and select the “Add Token or NFT to your Deck” option, and then select your desired asset. You can enter as many as eight different assets in the available deck slots like this!At this point, it’s just a waiting game—you can check back on this Jackpot page to manage your entries over time and track if any of your assets are winners going forward. If you’re lucky, you’ll win at least one nice chunk of Blast Gold before the official Blast airdrop, and if you’re really lucky you may win multiple—they’re are only so many assets on the young L2 right now, after all.

Nibiru COO highlights grants as a magnet for TradFi talent in crypto - Crypto Briefing




The presence of crypto among institutional investors is on the rise, especially after the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. Companies such as JPMorgan, UBS, and Wells Fargo declared Bitcoin ETF holdings in their recent 13F filings.This rise in institutional interest can also be seen in the professional area. Executives with backgrounds in traditional finance (TradFi) are rotating to crypto as the market matures. Former Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Jonathan Chang, is one of these executives, now in the role of COO at layer-1 blockchain Nibiru.He shared insights with Crypto Briefing on valuable TradFi skills that can be used in crypto, how grants are a powerful tool to attract more of the traditional market, and how those professionals can help solve crypto issues.Crypto Briefing – What was your biggest challenge when pivoting from traditional finance to crypto? What set of skills learned from TradFi were most valuable when joining this new market?Jonathan Chang – Crypto is known for its unique complexities. Traditional Finance (TradFi) offers a more relatable framework for understanding decentralized finance due to its familiar concepts. However, there is still a learning curve, particularly with the specialized terminology used in crypto.For instance, while the principles of lending, including borrowers, underwriting, credit assessment, and lenders are well-established in TradFi, the application of these concepts in crypto—built on smart contract platforms and enhanced with tokenomics—introduces a new layer of complexity.In fintech, the ledger is fundamental for recording bank transactions. This concept closely parallels the blockchain ledger used in crypto, which also records transactions but does so in a decentralized way.I’ve noticed that fintech and crypto startups often share similar goals, particularly in speeding up payments and financial services. The main difference lies in the technology stacks each uses to achieve these goals.Now that I’m more involved in crypto, my background in traditional finance is proving beneficial. My experience in equity research enhanced my analytical and writing skills, and deepened my understanding of how markets moved.In investment banking, I refined my abilities in structuring transactions, managing teams, and general soft skills. Venture capital and growth equity offered opportunities to meet diverse founders, understand market mapping, and appreciate business differentiation. These skills were invaluable, aiding in process management, quality control, and leveraging a broad network in new environments.Often, creative problem-solving is essential, and having a variety of experiences from high-pressure situations has become increasingly valuable. These reference points from my past work are helpful tools in navigating and innovating within crypto.Crypto Briefing – Are grants a valuable way to attract talent to crypto? Do you think of grants as just a money incentive, or do you think of a proper introduction to the market and its technologies?Jonathan Chang – Grants play a crucial role in drawing talent to the crypto and DeFi sectors, providing much more than just financial incentives. In a time when funding is limited and developers and entrepreneurs urgently need resources to bring their ideas to life, grants offer vital early support.Equally important, however, is the comprehensive ecosystem support that a well-designed grant program provides. This includes access to mentorship, technical resources, and a network of like-minded innovators, fostering an environment ripe for learning, experimentation, and growth.At Nibiru, our grant program is crafted to achieve these goals. We offer financial assistance and leverage our extensive network and expertise to enhance our grantees’ success. This support includes connecting them with VC partners, offering mentorship opportunities, and providing access to our advanced developer suite. Our objective is to give a complete introduction to the market and the tools needed to succeed.The Nibiru ecosystem is dedicated to empowering developers, helping them become catalysts for positive Web3 transformation. Our grants initiative not only supports through partnerships and mentorship but also boosts the visibility of projects within our ecosystem with targeted marketing support.Our grants are structured with Total Value Locked (TVL) milestones in mind, aiming to find partners committed to long-term growth within the chain. During our diligence process, the chemistry between the founder and our team is a key factor in ensuring aligned goals and collaborative potential.Crypto Briefing – Despite being better, crypto UX is still a threshold to capture more users and talent. Do you believe that non-native crypto talent’s point of view is an important piece to solve this problem?Jonathan Chang – Absolutely. A major challenge in the crypto industry today is the complexity of the user experience. Despite significant innovation, many blockchain applications remain too complex for the average user.This is where non-native crypto talent becomes crucial. These individuals may not possess deep technical knowledge of blockchain but offer fresh perspectives and a strong focus on user-centric design.They are key to bridging the gap between sophisticated technology and the seamless, user-friendly experiences that people expect. At Nibiru, we see this in action. Our team, drawn from a mix of backgrounds, including traditional finance, technology, and consumer industries, brings diverse viewpoints that are critical in developing relatable products.They challenge us to simplify and humanize our offerings, urging us to prioritize the user journey over technical details. As a result, they help us create not just functional but genuinely enjoyable experiences. So, to directly answer your question—yes, I firmly believe that non-native crypto talent is essential in addressing the UX challenges in crypto.

Bracebridge Capital Becomes Largest Bitcoin ETF Holder, Investing $380 Million In All-In Bet | Bitcoinist.com


								Last week, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market experienced a notable shift in investor sentiment. Positive inflows were reported, breaking a streak of outflows that had persisted for almost a month. The week concluded with a significant $116 million positive inflows, indicative of growing interest in the newly approved index funds.
Notably, a new player entered the market and made substantial investments, quickly becoming one of the largest holders of Bitcoin ETFs.
Bracebridge Capital Nets Major ETF Holdings
Bracebridge Capital, a Boston-based hedge fund, reported owning $262 million worth of Ark Invest’s ARKB ETF. Additionally, they emerged as the largest owner of Blackrock’s IBIT with an investment of $81 million. 

Bracebridge Capital also holds $20 million of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which experienced negative outflows of $103 million during the same period. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas described Bracebridge Capital’s investment as a “wild” move, noting the firm’s significant acquisitions.

It is also worth mentioning the growing number of holders for each ETF, with IBIT boasting 250 holders in the first quarter alone, which is notable for a recently launched product.
Bitcoin ETF Outflows In Hong Kong Persist
In contrast, the Bitcoin ETF market in Hong Kong has been experiencing slower but consistent outflows. On Friday, May 10, 2024, there was an outflow of $6.3 million, followed by an $18.5 million outflow on Monday, May 13, 2024. However, it should be noted that Bosera and Harvest are yet to report for Monday, according to Farside data. 
These outflows come amidst rumors that Bitcoin ETFs listed in Hong Kong could soon become accessible to investors from mainland China.
As previously reported, Richard Byworth, Managing Partner at SyzCapital, sparked speculation about integrating Hong Kong-listed Bitcoin ETFs into the Stock Connect system, potentially allowing mainland Chinese investors to access these funds. 
Byworth’s remarks on social media highlighted ongoing discussions surrounding this potential integration, which could lead to a significant influx of capital from mainland China into the Bitcoin ETF market. 
The initial performance of the ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF, which gathered $121 million on its first trading day, has fueled optimism about the future of Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong. 

Samson Mow, a prominent figure in the industry, expressed bullish sentiments. At the same time, Brian HoonJong Paik, Co-founder & COO at SmashFi, emphasized the potential socio-economic benefits of mainland Chinese interest in Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs. 
Paik highlighted the vast amount of Chinese wealth in real estate, suggesting that alternative investment opportunities could help stabilize the socio-economic landscape and mitigate social unrest.
As discussions continue, market participants are closely monitoring its potential impact on capital flows and the overall adoption of digital asset funds in the region.

Shiba Inu Adoption: People Can Now Book Airbnb or Buy Nike Clothes via SHIB


																TL;DR

CoinGate, a blockchain payment processor, has added Shiba Inu as a payment method, integrating it with Polygon and Binance Smart Chain.
SHIB’s price experienced an uptick lately, while its market capitalization neared $14 billion.


Enabling SHIB Payments
CoinGate – a blockchain payment processor headquartered in Lithuania – became the latest entity to embrace the popular meme coin – Shiba Inu – as a payment method. To do so, it integrated SHIB with Polygon and Binance Smart Chain. 

The payment gateway enables businesses to buy, sell, manage, and accept cryptocurrencies. It acts as a bridge between crypto and traditional finance, facilitating transactions for goods and services. 
Popular companies that collaborate with the payment processor in some way include Airbnb, Nike, Spotify, Walmart, IKEA, Uber, and many more.

Memestock Mania Returns | Bankless


Memestock Pop-Off. GameStop Corporation (GME) shares soared as much as 126% off their Friday close, the stock’s largest single-day spike since the height of the memestock frenzy in January 2021! Why has GME surged in such dramatic fashion, and could this development be a harbinger of good tidings for your crypto bags?While wild swings in GME triggered circuit breakers to halt trading numerous times this morning, highlighting the immense amount of realized volatility from this move, GME had been displaying unexpectedly high volatility throughout May after a short squeeze at the start of this month already sent the stock rallying by 40%.Monthly options on US-listed stocks are set to expire this Friday and market participants were heavily long in-the-money GME call positions for this expiration, forcing the dealers who sold these calls to repurchase stock as the price rose to hedge their exposure, a textbook example of a short squeeze.
This explosion in GME has also been marked by the return of Roaring Kitty (aka Keith Gill) to Twitter, an investor who championed short squeezes throughout 2021 only to vanish from the internet shortly after GME’s third pump in July of that year.His account tweeted out a picture of an individual leaning forward in a chair as if to indicate that it's time to pay attention on Sunday, following up the initial post with a series of inspirational clips from popular movies.Popular American movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, another primary beneficiary of the 2021 memestonk craze, has not experienced triple-digit daily returns like GME, but still managed to pop over 50% on the day.The last memestock short squeeze catalyzed by a historic GME run-up was followed by a near 12-month uninterrupted streak of gains for broader equity markets before the Federal Reserve’s interest rate raises sucked liquidity out of the market.Although market participants are uncertain about the timing of future rate cuts, their eventual occurrence has been accepted with near certainty given the steadily deteriorating global economic condition, eliminating rate increases as a future risk factor for bulls.With year-over-year growth in the monetary supply as measured by M2 turning positive for the first time since 2022 and animal spirits seemingly taking control of TradFi, it is certainly feels possible that prices of crypto assets prices could continue to run, drawing an increased amount of investors and their capital into the space as they seek return.

Why, for Some, Crypto Is the Defining Political Issue of Our Times

I understand that, ideally, voters should care more about things like abortion, environmental and immigration policy than crypto. (Most probably do.) I understand Zuckerman and Albus’ distaste for Trump, his sexual assault charges, alleged fraud and election denialism. I understand why, optically, crypto casting itself as conservative is a dubious proposition, an expedient way to get 40+% of the population to turn their minds against it, as Laura Shin astutely pointed out.

Annoying News from Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs: Seen for the First Time Since Launch - Bitcoin Sistemi

There were significant outflows in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs listed in Hong Kong today, after Bitcoin fell below $61,000 on Friday.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs from issuers ChinaAMC, Harvest Global, Bosera and Hashkey saw an outflow of $32.7 million on Monday, according to data from Farside Investors. This figure is significantly more than previous debuts, which generally hovered around $6 million.


Today was a first in the history of these funds. All six cryptocurrency ETFs, including both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), reported negative flows for the first time since their launches on May 2. Notably, Harvest Global has never seen an outflow for its spot Bitcoin fund.
Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw significant outflows, with $6.6 million outflows from the funds. This figure is also significantly higher than past figures.





After eight days of trading, investors had withdrawn nearly $13 million from six ETFs. This result was disappointing for Asia-based ETFs, especially when compared to the exciting initial period for their US-listed counterparts.

Many industry enthusiasts point out that the Hong Kong-based ETF market is relatively small, with around $50 billion in assets. In stark contrast, the ETF market in the US is estimated to have approximately $9 trillion in assets under management.


Rumors had spread that mainland Chinese investors were gaining access to funds through Stock Connect, which would open the doors to a much larger investor base. However, the Hong Kong stock exchange denied these rumors early on Monday, stating that they were false.

                        Iconic retail stock trader/investor “Roaring Kitty,” who rose to fame during the 2021 meme stock surge, just posted on X for the first time since 2021, igniting a surge in the excitement that a new meme stock/meme coin trading season could be inbound, and with traders feverishly hunting for meme coins that could be the next GME stock.GameStop icon Roading Kitty—Keith Gill in real life—posted a meme about “locking in.” The implication could be that Roaring Kitty is about to refocus on his trading.GameStop was last up 70% on Monday, with GME reaching around $30 as per Yahoo Finance. Roaring Kitty was a major champion of beaten-down stock GameStop prior to its stunning 2021 pump.Roaring Kitty’s GameStop position is thought to have surged to as much as $50 million in 2021 at its peak.Other popular stocks during the 2021 meme stock craze also picked up. AMC Holdings (AMC) was up 45% on Monday.The return of Roaring Kitty hasn’t just sparked excitement in meme stock markets. Indeed, there has been a surge in risk-taking activity in across the crypto meme coin space.Scores of meme coins related to Roaring Kitty, Gamestop, and the 2021 meme stock craze are pumping.Roaring Kitty (KITTY) was up 21,000% in 24 hours, as per DEXTools. Wall Street Bets (WSB) was up 4,500%. And GamgeStop (GME) was up 2,200%.None of these meme coins have any official connection to the original persons/communities/companies. They are purely just borrowing the name.Additionally, none of these meme coins, beyond their 2021 meme stock craze links names, have any real utility or prospect of long-term growth.Traders looking for the next GME stock should check out these meme coins instead.Are These 5 Meme Coins the Next GME Stock?Dogecoin (DOGE)Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 9% on Monday as traders grew excited that it could be the next GME stock.Dogecoin is the largest and oldest meme coin by market capitalization and was last near $0.1550.The meme coin’s market cap is a whopping $22.2 billion.But many think DOGE will one day reach $1, which would see its market cap swell to over $140 billion.Investors willing to ride the DOGE rollercoaster could be looking at 6.5x gains if $1 is reached.That might not be as impressive as GME’s 2021 gains. But Dogecoin remains one of the best meme coin bets.Shiba Inu (SHIB)The second largest meme coin in crypto, Shiba Inu (SHIB), is another good bet for the next GME stock.SHIB was last up 7.5%, eyeing an upside break from a pennant structure.That could reignite a quick surge back to March highs above $0.000045.Shiba Inu could be the next GME stock if it can break this pattern. Source: TradingViewThat would be a near 100% rally from current levels near $0.000024.Like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has a dedicated, massive community with over 3.8 million followers.As a result, it is likely to stay a major player in the meme coin space in the long term.Slothana (SLOTH)Since its recent launch, an exciting new Solana meme coin called Slothana (SLOTH) has seen an amazing start to life.The Sloth-themed meme coin has grown 550% since its May 1 launch and has a market cap near $100 million.Slothana seeks to replace its Sloth-themed meme coin predecessor Slerf (SLERF), which at one point had a market cap of nearly $500 million.But Slerf has since dropped back to $145 million. Slothana could soon take the crown as the biggest Sloth meme coin.As meme coin risk appetite returns, it could become a multi-billion-dollar coin. Slothana is a good bet for the next GME stock.Dogeverse (DV)Another exciting meme coin with novel cross-chain capabilities called Dogeverse (DV) is available in presale.Dogeverse is a multi-chain spin on Dogecoin, launching on the six most used blockchains, excluding Bitcoin, with multi-chain bridge capabilities.There are a host of chains out there vying to be the go-to destination for meme coin launches – Dogeverse plans to fit the bill by being present on all chains that matter.The multi-chain meme coin has raised more than $15 million so far.Potential investors don’t have long to buy before launch.

Uniswap founder says Biden's indifference toward crypto could cost him elections

Uniswap founder Hayden Adams criticized President Joe Biden’s approach to crypto regulation and said his administration’s perceived indifference to crypto could be a significant miscalculation in the 2024 election.Adams warned in a May 13 post on social media that the administration is ignoring a key issue for many Americans and compared the decision to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign strategy. He said:“Hillary campaigning in red states instead of swing states level miscalculation from Biden camp thinking crypto will be irrelevant in 2024 election and letting SEC + Warren wage total war — both in terms of voters and money.”The Uniswap founder’s comments reflect growing frustration within the crypto community over what they see as aggressive regulatory actions led by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and vocal critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).Adams suggested the Biden administration’s current stance could alienate a crucial voter base and financial backers. He pointed out that Republicans are increasingly embracing crypto, seeing an opportunity to attract disillusioned voters and donors from the crypto sector. He wrote:“Republicans smell blood in the water and are turning hard towards crypto.”This shift, he argued, could have significant implications for the 2024 election, potentially swaying votes and financial support away from Democrats.Adams urged those close to Biden and the Democratic leadership to recognize the seriousness of the situation and advocate for a more favorable stance toward digital assets.Key voter issueAmerican voters’ views toward crypto are evolving rapidly, with a recent Harris Poll revealing that nearly 60% of Americans have some familiarity with digital assets, and about 20% have invested in crypto.Younger voters, particularly those in the 18-34 age bracket, show a higher propensity for crypto investment and support for pro-crypto policies. The demographic’s growing influence could be pivotal in upcoming elections.Moreover, the poll highlighted a partisan divide in attitudes toward crypto. Republicans are generally more supportive of crypto adoption and innovation, viewing it as a symbol of free market principles and technological advancement.In contrast, many Democrats advocate for more robust regulatory oversight to prevent fraud and protect consumers, reflecting broader concerns about financial stability and systemic risk.The Biden administration’s approach to crypto has been a contentious issue, with proponents arguing that tighter regulations are necessary to protect consumers and the financial system. At the same time, critics contend that excessive regulation stifles innovation and economic growth.As the 2024 election approaches, the debate over crypto regulation will likely intensify, with both parties vying for the support of a rapidly growing and increasingly influential industry.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Bitcoin Deja Vu: Metric Mirrors Pattern That Led To 2021 Top


								On-chain data suggests a Bitcoin indicator is currently mirroring the same trend that led to the top of the bull run in 2021.
Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Distribution Appears To Be Ending
As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the BTC long-term holders are currently showcasing a trend that’s reminiscent of 2021.
The “long-term holders” (LTHs) are Bitcoin investors who have been keeping their coins dormant (that is, not transferring or selling them from their wallet) for more than 155 days.

Generally, the longer a holder keeps their coins still, the less likely they are to move them at any point. As such, the LTHs, with their long holding times, are considered the market’s resolute hands.
These investors usually don’t react to events in the wider market, like a rally or crash, but this year’s price surge towards the new all-time high (ATH) has forced even these HODLers into selling.
The chart below shows the trend in the total Bitcoin supply held by the addresses belonging to the LTH cohort over the last few years:

Looks like the value of the metric has observed a drawdown in recent months | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
As the graph shows, Bitcoin LTHs were accumulating between the May 2021 crash and this year’s rally. With this rise towards the new ATH, though, the supply of these HOLDers has started observing a downtrend instead.
Something to keep in mind is that the indicator has a 155-day delay when it comes to buying, as only mature supplies can count under it.
Thus, when the metric goes up, it doesn’t mean that there is accumulation in the present but rather that some buying occurred 155 days ago, and these coins have just now aged enough to count under the LTHs.
For selling, though, no such delay is attached, as coins exit the group as soon as they are transferred on the network. As such, the latest decline would correspond to a selloff that has been happening in the present.
Recently, as the Bitcoin price has fallen prey to stagnation, the LTHs have slowed down their selling, with the supply more or less moving sideways. As Maartunn has highlighted in the chart, this trend is similar to what was observed in 2021.
The LTHs ending their distribution then meant a top for the cryptocurrency. A similar pattern was also witnessed during the 2017 bull run. Therefore, going by these historical precedents, the latest flat movement in the LTH supply could also suggest a potential peak for the latest bull run.

This is only if, of course, the LTH distribution has truly ended. The chart shows that in each of the last two bull markets, the initial sharp selling from the LTHs was followed up by a phase of slower-paced distribution.
This slowed-down decline continued for months before the metric reached the consolidation phase and the asset’s top occurred. It now remains to be seen if the latest trend shift in the Bitcoin LTH supply corresponds to the former or the latter phase.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around the $62,700 level, down almost 2% over the past week.

Mark Cuban Urges CFTC Regulation of Crypto and Suggests Impact on 2024 Election



                    

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban recently voiced strong opinions about the need for clearer regulatory frameworks within the cryptocurrency industry in the United States, urging the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to oversee all crypto-related activities. 



In a post directed to his 8.8 million followers on X on May 10, Cuban emphasized the urgency of legislative action prior to the 2024 presidential election, suggesting that it could influence the re-election of President Joe Biden.




Cuban stated, “You could solve this problem for Biden by passing legislation that defines registration that is specific to the crypto industry just as other industries have registration that is defined for them.” 



His comments reflect a broader concern within the crypto community about the need for tailored regulatory measures that can foster both innovation and consumer protection.



Highlighting the potential political repercussions of regulatory decisions, Cuban pointedly mentioned Gary Gensler, the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), known for his stringent stance on cryptocurrencies. 




Cuban argued that Gensler’s approach could alienate crypto voters, implying that this could be a decisive factor in the upcoming election. 



“If Joe Biden loses, there is a good chance you will be able to thank Gary Gensler and the New York SEC,” Cuban said, suggesting that a more crypto-friendly regulatory approach could be more advantageous.



He proposed a more effective alternative, advocating for the CFTC to take charge of all crypto regulations.



This idea aligns with the growing consensus among younger and independent voters who perceive crypto as a significant part of their financial interaction and are critical of the SEC’s handling under Gensler’s leadership.

Cuban harshly criticized Gensler’s record, saying, “Crypto is a mainstay with younger and independent voters. Gensler HAS NOT PROTECTED A SINGLE INVESTOR AGAINST FRAUD.”



Data from litigation consulting firm Cornerstone Research indicates that the SEC undertook 46 enforcement actions against crypto firms in 2023 alone, underscoring the aggressive regulatory landscape. 



Meanwhile, Rostin Behnam, Chair of the CFTC, anticipates another wave of enforcement within the next six to 18 months, hinting at ongoing challenges for the sector.



The discourse around cryptocurrency regulation is poised to be a significant issue in the 2024 U.S. election. 



A recent poll reported by Cointelegraph on May 7, conducted among 1,201 registered voters, found that over two-thirds resonate with the sentiment that “crypto is for people like them, and more equitable than the financial system.”



This unfolding narrative captures the complex interplay between politics, regulatory actions, and the vibrant dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, reflecting a critical juncture in the regulatory oversight of digital assets in the U.S.

Solana Price Prediction as SOL Trading Volume Soars to $2.5 Billion – Are Whales Buying the Dip? / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Solana (SOL) price has jumped back up to test $150 from earlier session lows under $140 amid a surge in trading volumes, as traders await a barrage of upcoming US economic data releases later in the week.As per Yahoo Finance, trading volumes on major exchanges surpassed $2.5 billion on Monday. That was the highest since last Tuesday.The impressive price rise still leaves the Solana price lodged well within its $120-$160 range over the past month.Wednesday’s US CPI and Retail Sales could shake things up, as traders assess the interest rate outlook.But ahead of then, the focus is on meme coins (and meme stocks) following Roaring Kitty’s sudden return.His return comes with gas fees very low across major blockchains like Ethereum.Solana has marked itself out in 2024 as the number one meme coin blockchain.If Roaring Kitty’s return coupled with low gas fees can start a new meme coin season, Solana could be a key beneficiary.Solana Price Prediction – Are Whales Buying the Dip?
Bitcoin (BTC), last at $63,000, also remains stuck within multi-month ranges and isn’t likely to see a major breakout soon.The macro backdrop remains uncertain, with traders unsure how soon and fast Fed rate cuts are coming.Spot Bitcoin ETF flows have crawled to a halt. The April halving proved to be a sell-the-news event, with post-halving rallies typically not coming in for 4-6 months.And we are heading into summer, typically a subdued/bearish time for Bitcoin.So Bitcoin could easily remain stuck within recent ranges for the foreseeable future. And that suggests that Solana might also be stuck within recent ranges.But say meme coin season returns and Solana meme coins take center stage.A break above $160 would open the door to a swift move back to $200.If it can break above $160 resistance, the Solana price is in with a shot of quickly rallying back to $200. Source: TradingViewHowever, should meme season fail, and the market’s broader malaise turn into a sell-off, Solana could break lower.$120 is key long-term support. Should this level break a quick test of $100 or lower would be on the cards.Alternatively, the Solana price would likely dip under $100 if it breaks below $120 support. Source: TradingViewSuch a sell-off would likely see short-term holders with a low tolerance for riding a drawdown, often referred to as “crypto tourists”, panic sell into the hands of higher conviction dip-buyers and whales.Such capitulation isn’t yet obvious. But you can bet that under $100 the Solana whales will come piling in to scoop up more.And this would be a great sign of a near-term bottom.Solana Alternative to Consider – Slothana (SLOTH)
An exciting new Solana meme coin called Slothana (SLOTH) has seen an amazing start to life since its recent launch.The Sloth-themed meme coin is up 550% since its May 1 launch, with a market cap now near $100 million.Slothana aims to supplant its Sloth-themed meme coin predecessor Slerf (SLERF), which at one point had a market cap of close to $500 million.But Slerf has since dropped back to $145 million. Slothana could soon take the crown as the biggest Sloth meme coin.As meme coin risk appetite returns, it could become a multi-billion-dollar coin.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe return of Keith Gill, a man closely linked to GameStop’s stock rally in 2021, has unleashed a massive flood of Solana-based meme coins through the pump.fun protocol. GME Stonks, GameOver, and KiethGillWifHat are just a few examples of tokens launched through pump.fun in the last 24 hours after Gill—a financial analyst and investor also known as Roaring Kitty—posted a meme on Twitter, resurfacing for the first time in years.Allowing anyone to launch a meme coin for only 0.02 SOL ($3), pump.fun notched its busiest day of deployments on Sunday after Gill posted an image of a man hunched forward in a chair with a video game controller in hand. In all, 14,500 different meme coins were launched via pump.fun that day, setting a new record, according to a Dune dashboard.Appearing to match Sunday’s pace of new Solana tokens, over 7,400 were also created through pump.fun on Monday, as of this writing. On Twitter, the pump.fun account appeared to reference Gill’s cat-themed moniker and an influx of associated tokens when it said, “Today is a good day for cats, that's for sure.”Pump.fun also acknowledged the not-so-good side of meme coins as well, such as how the value of the volatile assets can plummet due to “rug pulls.” The pump.fun team asked Gill on Twitter if he was “interested in grifting [on his] followers with a coin launch,” effectively inviting him to join in.Whether anonymous developers simply added an image of a hat to Gill or employed a popular misspelling of words, Monday’s Gill- and GameStop-themed coins added to the growing list of 512,000 tokens deployed using the Solana protocol. Since pump.fun’s January release, those launches have resulted in around 127,000 SOL or $19 million in revenue for the protocol in the form of gas fees.Some Solana-based tokens drew inspiration from videos Gill posted Monday after his initial reappearance. For example, playing off of the inclusion of the Marvel superhero Wolverine in one, a token named Roaring Wolverine was launched—and appears to have already crashed. Once known for making frequent, top-rated posts on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets, Gill is credited with corralling thousands of traders in 2020 to bet against Wall Street through one of its most shorted stocks. Following a historic short squeeze that sent GameStop share price skyrocketing to $483, however, the figure of modern financial folklore largely faded from the public’s view.As GameStop’s stock surged on Wall Street Monday following Gill’s reemergence, trading was halted several times. Meanwhile, a Solana-based token that borrowed GameStop’s ticker name increased nearly 1,700% along with others inspired by the meme stock craze.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Hard to Believe Statement from Fund Manager: "Solana Price Could Rise to $400, Here's Why" - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to Ryan McMillin, Chief Investment Officer of cryptocurrency fund manager Merkle Tree Capital, Solana is predicted to rise to $400 during the US elections in November, riding on the wave of election-themed memecoins.
Two Solana-based altcoins, Jeo Boden and Donald Tremp, named after mashed-up versions of the last two US presidents, were instrumental in this prediction. These memecoins helped Solana surpass Ethereum in trading volume this Thursday.


“Memecoins will move deeper into the bull market,” said McMillin, suggesting that these two altcoins will be actively traded in the coming months. The rise of these memecoins coincided with former US President Donald Trump's strongest-ever support for crypto and current President Joe Biden's threat last week to veto a pro-crypto bill, thus making cryptocurrencies an election issue.
According to the analyst, the volatility experienced in Solana due to this news is expected to restore investors' confidence in the blockchain, which has been marred by outages over the years. “While Memecoins are a ridiculous and short-term speculative tool, they pave the way for other, more sustainable use cases, such as the tokenization of real-world assets,” McMillin added.






Currently, Solana is trading around $136, which is still far from the all-time high of $260 set in November 2021. But according to McMillin, the increased transaction volume served as a real stress test for the Solana network.
Additionally, the analyst suggested that Solana's price will be supported by more liquidity entering the market as the US Treasury takes steps to strengthen the economy.

Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe make the shortlist for best crypto to buy now. Image by cryptonews.com
                        As cryptocurrency markets rebound ahead of a week packed with important US economic data releases, various meme coins are leading the pack and might be the best crypto to buy now.Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading in the upper $62,000s, up 2% on the day but still stuck within recent ranges.US CPI and Retail Sales data out on Wednesday could shock the market out of its recent ranges.As traders await macro catalysts, an unexpected theme has jumped into focus on Monday.Legendary GameStop (GME) meme stock investor Roaring Kitty resurfaced on X for the first time since 2021.The icon of the 2021 meme stock surge’s return has resulted in a surge in meme coin risk-taking activity.Meme coins are dominating the top performer charts today. Here are some that might be the best crypto to buy now.
Best Crypto to Buy NowDogecoin (DOGE)Dogecoin’s Potential for GrowthMonday saw a 5% surge in Dogecoin (DOGE) price as traders speculated on the potential arrival of a new meme coin season. As the largest and oldest meme coin by market capitalization, Dogecoin currently sits just under $0.15, boasting a substantial market cap of $22.2 billion.Despite its current price, many enthusiasts believe DOGE could reach the coveted $1 mark, propelling its market cap to over $140 billion.This potential for exponential growth, representing a 6.5x increase from its current value, positions Dogecoin as one of the best cryptos to buy today for investors willing to embrace the volatility inherent in the meme coin market.Shiba Inu (SHIB)
Shiba Inu (SHIB), currently the second-largest meme coin by market cap, also presents itself as a compelling investment opportunity.The recent 4% price increase, coupled with a potential upside break from its pennant structure, suggests a possible surge toward its March highs above $0.000045.Shiba Inu could be the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewSuch a rally would represent a near 100% increase from its current price, hovering around $0.000024.With a market cap exceeding $14 billion, Shiba Inu mirrors Dogecoin’s strength in its dedicated and vast community of over 3.8 million followers. This strong community support suggests that Shiba Inu is well-positioned to be the best crypto to buy today.Pepe Coin (PEPE)
Pepe Coin (PEPE) pumped to new record highs on Monday above $0.000011 per token.While it has since retraced lower to $0.000010, PEPE is still up 13% in 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.If it retraces to $0.000009, this could be a great support zone to buy at.Pepe could be the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewA still modest market cap of $4.2 billion suggests Pepe has some more room to run.PEPE could easily become a $20 billion meme coin in the years ahead. Potential 5x gains make it among the best cryptos to buy now.
Exciting Meme Coin Presale to Consider – Dogeverse (DV)
The above-noted meme coins could all post solid 3-5x gains.But if meme coin investors want to lock in 50-100x gains, they need to target newer/lesser-known coins.Analysts at Cryptonews are excited about a new meme coin, Dogeverse (DV), which is available in presale and has novel cross-chain capabilities.Dogeverse distinguishes itself from other meme coins through its multi-chain approach, launching on six of the most widely used blockchains (excluding Bitcoin) and incorporating multi-chain bridge capabilities. The strategic decision could position Dogeverse as a frontrunner in the competitive meme coin market, capitalizing on the diverse blockchain ecosystem.The project has already attracted considerable attention, raising over $15 million in presale funding. Its multi-chain accessibility and ambitious vision suggest Dogeverse possesses the ingredients for viral success, attracting investors eager to participate in its presale phase.Visit Dogeverse Here

The U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) print is expected on Tuesday, May 14, followed by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading on May 15. According to the CME’s FedWatch tool, market analysts forecast a 72% chance of rates remaining the same at July’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with the possibility of rate cuts pushed later in the year, at 48.6% at September’s meeting.

CFTC announces $1.8M settlement against brokerage firm FalconX

The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that it had both filed and settled charges against cryptocurrency brokerage firm Falcon Labs for roughly $1.8 million in disgorgement and penalties.In a May 13 notice, the CFTC said Falcon Labs, owned by FalconX, had failed to register as a futures commission merchant, “inappropriately facilitat[ing] access to digital asset exchanges.” The settlement required FalconX to cease offering services to U.S. residents and pay roughly $1.2 million in disgorgement and $600,000 in civil monetary penalties.“The CFTC’s enforcement program has made clear it will not tolerate digital asset exchanges that fail to register with the CFTC or comply with the agency’s rules that maintain integrity in the derivatives markets,” said Enforcement Director Ian McGinley. “And now the CFTC is taking the fight one step further by, for the first time, charging an intermediary that inappropriately facilitated access to those exchanges.”The settlement alleged that FalconX facilitated orders for digital asset derivatives for U.S. users from October 2021 to March 2023 through its ‘Edge’ product. According to the CFTC, the brokerage firm voluntarily improved its practices after its lawsuit with Binance and former CEO Changpeng Zhao. In that case, the CFTC and other U.S. authorities settled for $4.3 billion in November 203.Related: Mark Cuban advocates for CFTC to regulate ‘all crypto’ ahead of US election dayThe regulator said that FalconX had provided “substantial cooperation and remediation,” resulting in the firm receiving a lower penalty. The CFTC order included that the firm was not “admitting or denying” any of the regulator’s findings or conclusions. Cointelegraph reached out to FalconX but did not receive a response at the time of publication.On May 6, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said crypto firms operating in the U.S. could expect “another cycle of enforcement actions” within two years.

OpenAI introduces GPT-4o model, promising real-time conversation

OpenAI announced a new model, GPT-4o, which will soon allow real-time conversation with an AI assistant.In a May 13 demo, OpenAI members showed that the model can provide breathing feedback, tell a story, and help solve a math problem, among other applications.Head of Frontiers Research Mark Chen noted that, although users could previously access Voice Mode, the new model allows interruptions, no longer has a multi-second delay, and can recognize and communicate in various emotional styles.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the update in a separate blog post, calling it the “best computer interface I’ve ever used,” adding that it “feels like AI from the movies.”He said:“Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change.”In addition to improved text, video, and visual capabilities, GPT-4o is faster and offers the same level of intelligence as GPT-4.Full availability pendingInitially, GPT-4o will have limited features, but the model can already understand and discuss images “much better than any existing model.” In one example, OpenAI suggested that the model can examine a menu and provide translations, context, and recommendations.Each of the company’s subscription models includes different access limits. Starting today, ChatGPT Free users can access the feature with usage limits. GPT-4o to ChatGPT Plus and Team users can also access GPT-4o with five times greater usage limits.The company also plans to extend the feature to Enterprise users later with “even higher limits.”OpenAI will introduce the updated “Voice Mode” in the near future. It plans to release an alpha in the coming weeks, with early access for Plus users.Competitive AI sectorOpenAI’s updates follow other upgrades from competing companies.In March, Anthropic released an upgrade to Claude that it called superior to OpenAI’s GPT-4. Meta, meanwhile, announced Llama 3 with an improved parameter count in April.Other industry developments are yet to occur. Google is set to host its I/O conference on May 14, featuring AI within several keynotes. Apple is expected to announce iOS 18 in June, which is expected to include various new AI features.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Led by Bitcoin, why is the crypto market up today? - AMBCrypto



Crypto markets are in the green once again, thanks to factors like CME, U.S. economy and long-term holders.
Bitcoin bulls are facing the stress of pulling prices back to the immediate support level of $68,000.

The global cryptocurrency market cap has seen an increase of 1.8% in the past twenty-four hours, coming up on what can be seen as a modest recovery from the start of the weekend. 
By this time yesterday, Bitcoin [BTC] was barely hanging onto $60,000. At press time, it was worth $63,111, up by 4% on the daily chart. But is there any special reason for this minute surge? And will it hold firm?
Why Bitcoin is up
Examining data from Coinglass, Bitcoin is the most liquidated asset over the past day. It has seen over $36 million gone, mostly from Binance [BNB]. 
Overall, the data suggests that traders are actively responding to price changes with corresponding changes in their market positions, indicating a market highly sensitive to both external influences and internal sentiment changes.
Source: Coinglass
Still. Bitcoin is in the green and going up. Looking at reasons for the abrupt resilience, Coinglass data also tells us that Bitcoin’s CME open interest has increased by over 3% in twenty-four hours.
 Moreover, spot netflow has seen nearly $140 million over the same timeframe.
Source: Coinglass
 
Another reason why Bitcoin is holding firm is the U.S. economic data getting released on the 14th of May. 
Going by the negative pattern Jerome Powell has established this year, interest rate decisions have proven to be bullish for Bitcoin, seeing as rate cuts aren’t coming anytime soon.
Meanwhile, experienced Bitcoin holders are echoing the 2021 bull market vibe, as suggested by some on-chain data. 
Currently, long-term holders (LTHs) are increasing their BTC holdings after having sold off early this year.
The data suggests that, similar to mid-2021, these long-term holders are trying to acquire a larger share of the BTC supply. 
They view the low Bitcoin prices as a chance to buy more coins at a bargain, to then sell them when market excitement picks up. 
A pattern can be traced from 2018 and 2021, showing a recurring cycle where long-term holders purchase during market lows and sell during highs. 
Despite these cycles, there’s a noticeable, persistent trend where an increasingly majority portion of Bitcoin is being held by long-term holders.
Bitcoin’s current stand
AMBCrypto’s dissection of TradingView data for the BTC/USDt pair reveals a strong resistance level around the $68,000 mark, which BTC has tested multiple times over the past month without a sustained breakthrough. 
Conversely, a clear support level is evident near the $60,000 level, below which, if Bitcoin falls, further corrections to $55k and beyond could be witnessed.
The frequent and relatively large price swings within short periods (as seen from the candlestick sizes) highlight the ongoing volatility in the Bitcoin market. 
This pattern suggests a trader’s market, where short-term gains can be captured based on swift movements.

As of the latest data point, the price is experiencing another pullback towards the upward support level. 
This could be indicative of another potential buying opportunity if the pattern holds as previous instances suggest. All in all, the bears are very much in control.

Crypto Analyst Predicts 3,000% Surge For Shiba Inu - Here’s The Timeline | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst Davie Satoshi has dropped a bullish prediction for Shiba Inu as part of what might be the future outlook for major meme coins. According to the analyst, SHIB is one of the meme coins with the potential to go on a 1,000% to 3,000% price surge amidst a flurry of cryptocurrencies in the meme coin niche. SHIB, on the other hand, is currently struggling with bearish price action as the bulls find themselves outnumbered by the bears.  
Surge Potential For Shiba Inu
The crypto market is full of different meme coins, each with its own community. Particularly, meme coin demand has shot up this year, with many new meme coins shooting up in value. However, investing in meme coins has its own demerits. This is because the value of these cryptocurrencies is driven by hype and sentiment, as most of them do not have a real-world utility to back up their value. As a result, some of them can tank quickly and go back to zero as easily as they shot up.

Despite this risk, some of these meme cryptocurrencies have established themselves as major industry players over the years. According to Davie Satoshi, SHIB is one of the few cryptocurrencies that fall in this safe category and can “never go to zero.” 
From his viewpoint, SHIB can go on a 10x to 30x journey in the current market cycle. This translates to a 1,000% to 3,000% surge to a price range of $0.0002250 to $0.0006750. Interestingly, this prediction is way above the current SHIB all-time high, which is at $0.00008616.
How Feasible Is This Price Target For SHIB?
SHIB is no stranger to price rises of epic proportions. After the last halving, SHIB went on an 800,000% price surge and turned many of its early holders into crypto millionaires overnight. However, the crypto landscape has evolved since then and SHIB would need to gain a better mainstream adoption and develop utility before a similar price surge can occur. 
SHIB has grown over the years from its early days as a meme cryptocurrency and now stands behind only DOGE in terms of meme coin market cap. The Shiba Inu ecosystem is now home to its own community projects including a layer-2 scaling solution (Shibarium), other tokens like BONK and LEASH, and many others. 

Shiba Inu’s team members are actively working to transform the cryptocurrency into a utility-based cryptocurrency. According to a similar prediction from crypto analyst Xanrox, Shiba Inu will definitely go higher later this year. Per his analysis, the best price to get in and catch the bounce to the upside is $0.00002249. 
At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002181 and is down by 3.45% in the past 24 hours. Davie Satoshi also mentioned DOGE, PEPE, WIF, and COQ as meme cryptocurrencies with the potential to grow by 10x to 30x.

50,000% Return? Bitcoin Whale Starts Moving Decade-Old BTC Investment | Cryptoglobe


                                
A long-dormant Bitcoin whale has seemingly resurfaced after nearly 11 years and has now moved 1,000 BTC worth nearly $61 million to new cryptocurrency wallets, at a time in which the price of the cryptocurrency started recovering.



According on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the whale made two transactions after being inactive for 10.7 years, moving funds from two wallets that received 500 BTC each back in September 2013, when Bitcoin was trading at just $124 per coin.



In total, the whale received $124,000 worth of the flagship cryptocurrency and remained dormant since then, allowing the price of BTC to appreciate around 50,000% to now trade at $63,000 per coin, which the whale moved to two new addresses.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The whale’s movements come at a time in which the price of the flagship cryptocurrency has been seemingly stuck in a range between the $59,000 and the $67,000 marks over the past month, after dropping from an all-time high of over $73,000 earlier this year over the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US.



As CryptoGlobe reported, Wall Street behemoth Susquehanna International Group, known for its vast trading volume across global financial products, has significantly increased its exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin, amassing a $1.2 billion position on it in Q1 2024.



According to a recent 13-HR filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Susquehanna International now holds a massive17,271,326 shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), valued at roughly $1.09 billion as of March 31, as well as 1,349,414 shares of Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), valued at approximately $83.74 million.

                        Rain cryptocurrency exchange experienced a potential exploit on April 29, which transferred approximately $14.1 million worth of various cryptocurrencies to a new wallet under suspicious circumstances, according to a May 13 report from on-chain analyst ZachXBT.ZachXBT shared the information via their Telegram channel, noting that the exploit occurred on April 29. It entailed suspicious outflows from Rain’s Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP wallets. Funds from these wallets were swiftly transferred to instant exchanges, exchanged for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and then transferred to two addresses on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.

Meanwhile, the Bitcoin address ending in “prp2” holds 137.9 BTC, valued at $8.6 million.Arkham Intelligence data reveals that the Ethereum destination address received its funds from an address ending in “d609,” which, in turn, received the funds from various Bitgo multi-signature wallets. Arkham has not explicitly attributed these wallets to Rain, however.BitGo MultiSig wallets are allegedly related to suspicious outflows in Rain. Source: Arkham Intelligence.Although these wallets have not been explicitly identified as belonging to Rain, they were involved in sending over 590 ETH ($1.7 million), approximately 20 billion Shiba Inu ($481,000), 12,500 Chainlink ($169,000), $240,000 Tether (USDT), and $500,000 USD Coin (USDC). These tokens were promptly swapped for ETH on Uniswap. Additionally, the Uniswap account received funds from a Binance hot wallet.Rain, a centralized crypto exchange based in Bahrain, primarily serves customers in Southwest Asia and the Middle East. Since its establishment, Rain has facilitated trading volumes exceeding $1 billion, according to regional news outlet The National.The exchange’s “pro” version has been intermittently down since May 5, according to Rain’s website, however.In 2023, Rain obtained approval from Abu Dhabi‘s financial regulator to operate as a virtual asset brokerage and custody service provider.
ZachXBT Alleges Lazarus Group’s Crypto Laundering
In recent posts, ZachXBT has made other substantial claims, including allegations that North Korea’s Lazarus Group laundered $200 million worth of cryptocurrency into fiat currency over a four-year period.According to ZachXBT’s analysis, at least $44 million worth of stolen crypto has been laundered through Paxful and Noones, utilizing two usernames, “EasyGoatfish351” and “FairJunco470,” which exhibited deposits and trading volumes corresponding to the stolen funds.The stolen funds were reportedly converted into Tether (USDT) stablecoin before being exchanged for cash and withdrawn. The Lazarus Group has historically relied on China-based over-the-counter traders for crypto-to-fiat conversions.Additionally, ZachXBT reported that a holder of Bored Ape Yacht Club tokens fell victim to a phishing attack, losing three rare NFTs – BAYC #7531, BAYC #6736, and BAYC #2100.Crypto investors lost $2 billion to hacks and exploits in the crypto industry last year, and an additional $333 million was stolen in the first quarter of this year.

Aptos Posts Triple-Digit Gains In Key Metrics, Yet APT Price Struggles At $8.40


																According to a report by Messari, Layer 1 (L1) blockchain Aptos experienced substantial gains in key metrics during the first quarter (Q1) of the year. The growth was driven by the surge in Bitcoin prices to new record highs and increased capital inflow in the market. 
However, Aptos’ native token, APT, has struggled with price performance, recording modest gains compared to other top cryptocurrencies.
Aptos Network Activity Surges
The report highlighted that Aptos’ circulating market cap increased 127% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to $6.6 billion.
This growth outpaced other projects with similar market caps, improving market cap rank from 33 to 22. Despite this growth, APT’s price experienced a more modest increase of 76% QoQ. 
Aptos’ market cap increase was recorded during Q1. Source: Messari
Aptos revenue, which encompasses all fees collected by the protocol, grew by 37% to $475,000. However, when denominated in APT, the revenue decreased by 10%. All revenue generated by Aptos is burned, but these burned tokens have not significantly reduced inflation.

APT inflation started at a 7% annualized rate and is set to decrease by 1.5% each year until it reaches 3.5%. By mid-October, the inflation rate had reduced to just under 6.9%. Additionally, there was inflationary pressure from the genesis supply unlocks, with almost 31% of the genesis supply distributed by the end of Q1.
Looking at network activity, Aptos witnessed a significant increase in transactions and active addresses in Q1. Average daily transactions and addresses saw 66% and 97% QoQ growth rates, respectively. 
Despite the increased transaction activity, the average transaction fee decreased by 45% QoQ to 0.0006 APT ($0.007). Furthermore, average daily new addresses grew by 91% QoQ to 44,000, and the weighted average one-month retention rate increased by 82% QoQ to 14%.
APT Staked Tokens Decrease 5%
Regarding staking, APT staked decreased by 5% to 861 million tokens. However, when denominated in USD, the staked market cap grew by 68% QoQ, surpassing $14 billion. 
Aptos’ DeFi TVL growth during Q1. Source: Messari
As seen in the chart above, Aptos also experienced growth in its decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL), which increased by 376% QoQ to $573 million. 
According to Messari, this increase was not solely due to APT price appreciation; TVL also grew by 170% QoQ in APT terms. Additionally, Aptos’s stablecoin market cap nearly doubled QoQ, reaching $97 million.
APT Struggles To Break $8.80 Resistance
Despite these positive developments, APT’s price performance has faced challenges. The native token has declined over 16% in the past month, resulting in a modest 2.7% surge year-to-date. This contrasts with the double or triple-digit gains seen by other top cryptocurrencies.

Currently trading at $8.46, APT has struggled to surpass its nearest resistance wall at $8.80, leading to a consolidation phase between $8.20 and $8.70 over the past month.

Keith Gill, Known as Roaring Kitty, Sparks Meme Stocks Rally


GameStop’s shares have seen a rally of more than 70%, reminiscent of a few years ago. This time, it was due to the return of trader and investor Keith Gill, better known as “Roaring Kitty.”
The stock market was set ablaze on Monday as Keith Gill, famously known as “Roaring Kitty,” suddenly returned to social media, reigniting the meme stock frenzy that captivated the world in 2021. 
Speculation Mounts Around Meme Stocks
Gill’s post on X, depicting a video gamer intently leaning forward — a stance known to signal serious gameplay — was enough to send GameStop and AMC Entertainment’s stocks through the roof, with increases of 77.5% and 77.9%, respectively.
This dramatic market reaction marks the first time Gill has been publicly active since his last appearance roughly three years ago. The mysterious post quickly attracted over 12 million views, with Gill adding a cryptic video clip hours later, further fueling speculation and excitement among traders.


GameStop saw its shares momentarily peak at a staggering 110% increase before stabilizing. The trading frenzy was so intense that it triggered multiple daily trading halts. Similarly, AMC shares also saw a significant uptick, with prices doubling at one point during the trading session.
The resurgence of these stocks can be traced back to Gill’s influence in the early days of the pandemic. His advocacy for GameStop, a struggling video game retailer at the time, drew in a horde of retail investors who opposed hedge funds shorting the stock. 

This collective action forced massive buy-ins from short sellers, skyrocketing the stock’s price and causing significant disruptions in the market.

Gill’s recent activity has spurred buying in GameStop and AMC and spilled over to other meme stocks like BlackBerry and Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., which experienced their own respective rallies. Still, some industry analysts remain skeptical. 

“I don’t think they have the numbers to keep this up, nor do I think the shorts have the resolve shown by Gabe Plotkin three years ago, so likely this fizzles as the fundamentals continue to deteriorate,” Wedbush’s Michael Pachter said.

Edward Snowden warns that Bitcoin developers must prioritize privacy at the protocol level to protect users as the U.S. government intensifies its scrutiny of crypto mixers.
                        Two crypto-supportive senators have urged the Justice Department (DOJ) to reconsider its recent enforcement action against a popular Bitcoin privacy service.Protecting Bitcoin Privacy Tools
On Monday, Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) publicly shared a letter arguing that the DOJ’s “unprecedented interpretation” of what constitutes an unlicensed “money services business” (MSB) contradicts both Treasury Department guidance and the intent of Congress.“This interpretation threatens to criminalize Americans offering non-custodial crypto asset software services,” read the letter, co-authored by Lummis and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR).Late last month, the DOJ arrested the founders of Bitcoin mixer Samourai Wallet for allegedly operating an unregistered MSB, allowing criminals to use their service for money laundering.Specifically, Samourai used CoinJoin transactions to enhance user privacy, which involves multiple parties combining the inputs and outputs of their transactions into one transaction, making the flow of funds difficult to trace on the blockchain.While Samourai’s wallet did require a centralized server to coordinate CoinJoin transactions, the service never involved taking control of users’ actual funds.That makes Samourai’s case a tricky legal topic, since the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) defines “money transmission” as “the acceptance of currency…and the transmission of currency…to another location or person by any means.”What Counts As Money Transmission?
The senators argued in their letter that such definitions were clear, and required so that other groups like internet service providers and postal code carriers weren’t caught up in the definition of an MSB. By the same logic, the definition would fail to capture that of crypto wallets where users maintain control of their private keys.“Subjecting developers of non-custodial crypto asset software to potential criminal liability… will only serve to stifle innovation and shake confidence in the DOJ’s respect for the rule of law,” the letter concluded.By contrast, the DOJ’s interpretation of the money-transmitting business statute posits that a money transmitter need not have actual control of the funds that it transfers. It likened money transmission to a USB cable transferring data between devices, or a frying pan transmitting heat from a stove the the pan’s contents.The DOJ has since issued a warning to crypto users that they could lose funds in wallets provided by non-regulated entities, which could face future prosecution by the department.

As 'Roaring Kitty' Returns, Here Are 3 ETFs To Leverage The 2024 Meme Stock Wave - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), AMC Enter Hldgs (NYSE:AMC) - Benzinga

Meme stocks have once again captured the spotlight in the financial market following the return of Keith Gill — known widely as “Roaring Kitty”— to social media after a three-year hiatus. For those unfamiliar, Gill is a pivotal figure in the meme stock phenomenon that took the financial world by storm in early 2021. As an individual investor and financial analyst, he became famous for his role in the explosive rise of GameStop Inc. GME’s stock price.The struggling video game retailer saw its shares soar from under $20 to nearly $500 at their peak in January 2021, largely driven by a short squeeze on investors who had bet against the stock amid weak fundamentals. Unlike traditional stocks, which are influenced by fundamental analysis and corporate performance, meme stocks are often subject to rapid price changes driven by hype and mass trading actions.Gill chronicled his investment journey across various platforms, including YouTube and Reddit, notably under the username u/DeepF******Value on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets. His philosophy is emblematic of a broader narrative about meme stocks and the democratization of investing, illustrating how individual investors can unite to disrupt the financial status quo of seasoned and large investors.Gill’s resurgence on  X (formerly known as Twitter) on May 13, sparked a viral reaction. A posted image of a man intensely focused on a video game, adopting a serious gaming stance, served as a metaphor for Gill’s impactful return to the public eye.The post has attracted considerable attention, amassing over 10K retweets, 24K quote tweets, 94K likes, and over 19 million views, highlighting its widespread appeal and significance.As a result, GameStop’s share price soared by 74% on Monday, representing the fourth-largest one-day gain since the company’s IPO in 2002. This surge trails only behind the spikes of 104% on Feb. 21, 2021, 135% on Jan. 27, 2021, and 93% on Jan. 26, 2021.Similarly, other meme-related stocks experienced significant increases. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC saw its shares climb nearly 80%, marking its most substantial single-day rise since June 2021, the third strongest in its history.

Price analysis 5/13: SPX, DXY, BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, TON, DOGE, ADA

Traders prefer a trending market rather than a range-bound one. Sometimes, when there is uncertainty about the next directional move, traders step to the sidelines, and that seems to be the case with Bitcoin (BTC). According to research firm Santiment, “fear and indecision” could be the factors that have led to a drop in Bitcoin’s on-chain activity toward historic lows. The firm clarified that it does not necessarily mean that Bitcoin will fall more.Bitcoin’s consolidation is giving opportunities to investors to load up on Bitcoin. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet said it had made a “strategic shift” in its treasury management strategy to follow a Bitcoin-only approach in response to a sustained decline in the Japanese yen. Metaplanet announced a purchase of 117.7 Bitcoin at an average price of $65,000.Daily cryptocurrency market performance.

However, even after repeated attempts, if the overhead resistance is not crossed, traders may dump their positions, starting a sharp pullback.Will bulls defend the essential support levels in Bitcoin and select altcoins?

If the 5,265 level is taken out, the index may travel toward 5,500.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will attempt to stall the up move at 5,265. If the price turns down from this level, the index may stay range-bound between 5,265 and 4,950 for a while.U.S. Dollar Index price analysisThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) broke below the 20-day EMA (105) on May 9, indicating aggressive selling by the bears on every minor rally.DXY daily chart.

If that happens, the index could rally to 106.50.Alternatively, if the price continues lower and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that the bears are in charge.

This level may act as a stiff resistance, but if the bulls surpass it, the pair may climb to $73,777.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 50-day SMA, it will indicate that bears are active at higher levels.

The pair may reach the stiff resistance at $162.Instead, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below $137, it will signal that bears are trying to take charge. The SOL/USDT pair could descend to $126, which is when the bulls are expected to start buying.XRP price analysisXRP (XRP) has been trading below the 20-day EMA ($0.52), but the bears have failed to sink the price to the essential support at $0.46.XRP/USDT daily chart.

Big Week: US CPI, Ethereum ETF, SEC vs Ripple, and More News


This week is key for the crypto market, as several pieces of news will show the industry players’ direction. 
From inflation data to legislation would affect the crypto industry, and even updates on spot Ethereum ETFs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple.
Wednesday’s US Consumer Price Index
This week, the market will witness the release of the US Consumer Price Index data, which could be busy defining the direction of the crypto market. Analysts expect the underlying CPI to rise 0.3%, up from 0.4% in March. 

“Investors need to have some level of reassurance that inflation is not going to go back up, and potentially down, to give the Fed cover for at least one or maybe two cuts before the end of the year,” Thomas Hayes, president of Great Hill Capital LLC, said.

The SEC’s Position on Spot Ethereum ETFs
Forecasts that rule out the SEC’s upcoming approval of spot Ethereum ETFs are growing. The regulator recently delayed the review of Galaxy Invesco’s proposed Ethereum ETF for 60 days until July 5. Meanwhile, ARK Invest and 21Shares removed staking from their SEC filing due to a regulatory crackdown on crypto staking. 
Analysts already predict Ethereum will fall to $2,500 if the ETF is denied. However, if approved, ETH could surpass $4,000.

In the coming weeks, the SEC will file a decision on several Ethereum ETF proposals. These include BlackRock, Grayscale, Ark Invest and 21Shares, Fidelity, VanEck, Hashdex, Franklin Templeton, Invesco Galaxy Digital, and Bitwise. 
Crypto Regulations in the US Congress
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry said the US Congress could vote on the “Financial Innovation and Technology Act of the 21st Century” (FIT21) before the end of May. FIT21 would impose jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies in investment contracts. 
Representatives believe the legislation would cement US leadership in the international financial system for decades. 


“With the floor vote announced today, Congress will take a historic step toward providing a clear regulatory framework for digital asset markets,” McHenry said.

SEC vs. Ripple Update Expected
Finally, one of the most emblematic legal cases in the crypto market, SEC v Ripple, is expected to make news headlines. The latest development around this is that both parties involved filed omnibus letter motions to seal proceedings.

These pieces of evidence represent one of the last steps before judges rule on the case. The goal is to conclude whether Ripple must pay a hefty fine for its XRP sales.

OpenAI’s latest upgrade essentially lets users livestream with ChatGPT

ChatGPT creator OpenAI has announced its latest AI model, GPT-4o, a chattier, more humanlike AI chatbot, which can interpret a user’s audio and video and respond in real time.A series of demos released by the firm shows GPT-4 Omni helping potential users with things like interview preparation — by making sure they look presentable for the interview — as well as calling a customer service agent to get a replacement iPhone.Other demos show it can share dad jokes, translate a bilingual conversation in real time, be the judge of a rock-paper-scissors match between two users, and respond with sarcasm when asked. One demo even shows how ChatGPT reacts to being introduced to the user’s puppy for the first time.  "Well hello, Bowser! Aren't you just the most adorable little thing?" the chatbot exclaimed.


“It feels like AI from the movies; and it’s still a bit surprising to me that it’s real,” said the firm’s CEO, Sam Altman, in a May 13 blog post.“Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change.”A text and image-only input version was launched on May 13, with the full version set to roll out in the coming weeks, OpenAI said in a recent X post. GPT-4o will be available to both paid and free ChatGPT users and will be accessible from ChatGPT’s API.OpenAI said the “o” in GPT-4o stands for “omni” — which seeks to mark a step toward more natural human-computer interactions. 


GPT-4o’s ability to process any input of text, audio and image at the same time is a considerable advancement compared with OpenAI’s earlier AI tools, such as ChatGPT-4, which often “loses a lot of information” when forced to multi-task.Related: Apple finalizing deal with OpenAI for ChatGPT iPhone integration: ReportOpenAI said “GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models,” which even includes picking up on a user’s emotions and breathing patterns.It is also “much faster” and “50% cheaper” than GPT-4 Turbo in OpenAI’s API.The new AI tool can respond to audio inputs in as little as 2.3 seconds, with an average time of 3.2 seconds, OpenAI claims, which it says is similar to human response times in an ordinary conversation.Magazine: ​​How to stop the artificial intelligence apocalypse: David Brin, Uplift author

Buy Or Sell Bitcoin? Quant Reveals What Leading Metric Says


																A quant has explained what a potential leading Bitcoin indicator could say about what’s next for the cryptocurrency’s price.
Bitcoin Coinbase Premium May Hold The Answer To Where BTC Goes Next
In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the trend currently taking place in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium. “We can use the trend of Coinbase Premium as a leading indicator of the future direction of BTC price,” notes the quant.
The “Coinbase Premium” is a metric that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).

	Related Reading



When the value of this indicator is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is higher than on Binance right now. Such a trend suggests the buying pressure is higher (or the selling pressure is lower) on the former platform than on the latter.
On the other hand, the negative premium implies Coinbase might be observing a higher amount of selling than Binance, as the asset is currently trading at a lower price there.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium over the last couple of years:

The 30-day MA value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant
As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Coinbase Premium has been positive recently, suggesting that Coinbase users have supported the asset through the rally.
Coinbase is popularly known as the preferred platform of the US-based institutional entities, while Binance has a more global user base. As such, the premium’s value can provide hints about how the behavior of the American whales differs from that of the rest of the world.
From the chart, it’s visible that the buying pressure from these institutional traders peaked alongside the price top but has since been declining. The metric continues to be positive overall, although it’s now quite close to the neutral zero mark.
In the graph, the quant has highlighted an interesting pattern that the cryptocurrency has followed regarding the Coinbase Premium during the last two years. It would appear that whenever the indicator has hit bottom in negative territory and reversed back to an uptrend, the coin’s price has observed a rebound.

	Related Reading



An example of this trend also played out just earlier in the year, when a reversal in the indicator led to Bitcoin observing a rally in which the asset would eventually break its all-time high.
The Coinbase Premium is currently riding a downtrend, but it’s yet to dip into negative territory. The analyst explains that BTC is in a “wait and see” phase, where a rebound might be a bit longer out. The metric has to first decline more and reach a reversal point, at least if the historical pattern has to repeat.
BTC Price
Bitcoin had slipped under $61,000 earlier, but the asset has found a slight rebound in the past day, returning above $62,700.

Crypto Fear and Greed Index signals greed: Bitcoin, altcoins to rally? - AMBCrypto



The crypto Fear and Greed Index indicated that the market could get greedy, going forward.
Ethereum and Solana could gain from the rise in greed as well.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] price hasn’t budged significantly over the past few days, suggesting a neutral market sentiment.
However, despite the inactivity of BTC’s price, the crypto Fear and Greed Index told a different story.
Holders get greedy
The Fear and Greed Index gave a reading of 57 at the time of writing, which suggested that most of the market was willing to buy BTC and was mostly bullish.
This could mean that BTC’s price may surge significantly going forward and may even reach the $65,000 level.
The long positions taken in favor of BTC had also grown materially from 48% to 51.23% over the past few days as well, according to Coinglass’ data.
Source: coinglass
At press time, BTC was trading at $62,581.09 and its price had grown by 2.21% in the last 24 hours.
Despite the recent uptick in price, the MVRV ratio for BTC had declined significantly, implying that most holders were still unprofitable and there wasn’t much selling pressure on the king coin.
Source: Santiment
However, it won’t just be BTC that will be affected by the rising greed in the markets. As BTC is highly correlated with other altcoins in the industry, they are expected to see growth as well.
Across the board
For instance, Ethereum witnessed an uptick of 1.27% as well in the last 24 hours.
AMBCrypto’s examination of Santiment’s data revealed that the velocity of ETH had also grown significantly, implying that the frequency of transactions occurring on the Ethereum network had surged materially.
This could mean a positive turn of events could unfold for ETH holders in the future.
Even though the price of ETH was growing, it was observed that the network growth for ETH had declined. This indicated that new addresses were losing interest in ETH as a token.
The falling network growth of ETH can hinder the ability of ETH’s price to climb in the future.

Other altcoins such as SOL could also benefit from a greedy market. At press time, SOL was trading at $145.66 and its price had grown by 0.44% in the last 24 hours.
Coupled with that, the social volume for SOL had also surged, indicating a rise in popularity for the SOL token.

Trader Says Two Ethereum Rivals Could Outperform Crypto Market, Predicts Rally for Low-Cap Altcoin - The Daily Hodl


								A popular crypto strategist is naming two Ethereum (ETH) challengers that he thinks will rise faster than the rest of the market once conditions improve.
Pseudonymous analyst The Crypto Dog tells his 776,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s long-term bullish on Near (NEAR).










According to the trader, NEAR has been one of the faster horses this cycle and he believes it will burst right out of the gate once the crypto market catches a bid.
“Still believe taking a multi-month NEAR position today is a good move. Lock it in and don’t trade it.
NEAR keeps showing relative strength along with coins [latching] AI (artificial intelligence) trend. When the market turns, it will outperform.”
At time of writing, NEAR is worth $6.95.
Next up, the analyst is also keeping a close watch on fellow layer-1 altcoin AIOZ (AIOZ). The Crypto Dog says he’s also willing to hold AIOZ over a multi-month period.
“Been ranging for the last couple of months, should pick up again and outperform when the market swings back. I’m trading lees, taking bigger, longer-time positions.”
At time of writing, AIOZ is trading at $0.778, down nearly 4% in the past day.
The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the gaming-focused crypto project Xai (XAI). According to the analyst, XAI could skyrocket by nearly 60% from current levels in the coming weeks.
“I’d think XAI can send back to $1 by June, seems like a good price at the moment. (I am a heavy bagholder).”

At time of writing, XAI is worth $0.635.

China Takes Down $295M Crypto Underground Bank: Beginning Of A Bigger Crackdown?


								Chinese law enforcement has disrupted a covert banking network that leveraged cryptocurrencies to execute unauthorized foreign exchange transactions totaling around 2.14 billion yuan ($295.8 million).
This illicit operation mainly converted the Chinese yuan into the South Korean won, evading the established legal frameworks for currency exchange.

Uncovering The Shadow Crypto Banking Network 
In Jilin province, police apprehended six people connected to this operation, underscoring the growing role of digital currencies in bypassing standard financial regulations.
According to official statements, this clandestine banking entity utilized cryptocurrencies’ inherent “anonymity and decentralization” to carry out these unlawful transactions.
It was reported that the accused managed domestic bank accounts to receive and channel funds and conduct over-the-counter cryptocurrency trades.
These activities primarily served several business types, including South Korean purchasing agents, cross-border e-commerce entities, and firms engaged in import-export trade. This setup enabled the illegal exchange of currencies between the yuan and the won, violating regulatory norms.
Notably, the busting of this underground bank is part of a broader crackdown by Chinese authorities on crypto-related activities. Despite banning cryptocurrencies and related operations like Bitcoin mining, China remains active in policing the sector.
This action follows the recent investigation of Yao Qian, a former pro-blockchain official, under suspicions of “serious violations of discipline and law.” However, details of the allegations against Qian remain unclear, with authorities only citing vague violations. The report noted:
Yao Qian, Director of the Science and Technology Supervision Department and Director of the Information Center of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, is suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and is currently under investigation by the Central Committee.
Challenges Facing China’s Digital Currency Initiatives
While China combats illegal crypto operations, it faces challenges in promoting its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-CNY, or digital yuan.
Despite government efforts to pilot the e-CNY in various cities and reports of billions in transactions, public reception remains tepid.
For instance, state employees in some regions are paid partly in digital yuan. Due to the lack of incentives and limited merchant adoption, they frequently convert their holdings back to cash.
The digital yuan struggles to compete with well-established digital payment platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay, which dominate online and offline transactions.

Sammy Lin, an account manager at a Chinese state bank, noted the absence of benefits in holding the digital yuan, stating, “There’s no interest if I leave it there, and there aren’t many places where I can use it.”
This sentiment reflects broader concerns about the e-CNY’s practicality and the need for more compelling use cases to ensure widespread adoption.

King Mark Cuban (KINGCUBA) to Surge 16,000% Ahead of ByBit Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and King Mark Cuban (KINGCUBA) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



King Mark Cuban (KINGCUBA), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 16,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KINGCUBA will be listed on ByBit, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy King Mark Cuban.



Currently, King Mark Cuban can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KINGCUBA on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for King Mark Cuban by entering its contract address – B8V4DqTWPUjY3TkPtUp14MUvcdNToT65JDpMtUDGL8Vz – in the receiving field.




KINGCUBA currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Here Are The Bitcoin Layer 2s To Watch Out For, According To Grayscale


																Crypto asset management giant Grayscale says there’s a “renaissance” in Bitcoin development, with several new Layer 2s (L2s) worthy of keeping an eye on.
In a new investor report, Grayscale analyst Michael Zhao argued how these technologies may both bring new use cases to Bitcoin and foster more market demand for BTC.
Rollups On Bitcoin
Zhao first named Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BitVM) among Bitcoin’s “most anticipated” next generation of applications.
Published by Robin Linus in October, BitVM is a new computing model for verifying computations on Bitcoin, opening the network to smart contract functionality more familiar to Ethereum.
One of the leading applications of BitVM in development is optimistic Bitcoin rollups, letting users batch fast, cheap transactions together in off-chain environments before settling them back to Bitcoin in one piece.




“While still in its early stages, projects like Build on Bitcoin aim to incorporate BitVM for future settlement,” the report stated. Late last month, developers at BitcoinOS published a whitepaper explaining a practical Bitcoin rollup system that would let users bridge BTC back and forth between rollups in a decentralized manner.
Another technology highlighted by Grayscale was Spiderchains, developed by Botanix Labs. Spiderchains are layer 2 chains secured by staked Bitcoin (BTC) within decentralized multi-signature wallets.
Users’ pegged Bitcoin assets are secured by a rotating subset of 100 ”orchestrators” that manage the layer 2 chain, which can feature any functionality seen on other blockchains, like Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Staking With Babylon
Babylon is also expanding the Bitcoin “staking” world through its BTC re-staking technology. This would allow BTC holders to stake their coins and earn yield on them by using them to secure other blockchain networks, like Solana or Ethereum, if the latter networks were upgraded to allow for it.
Finally, projects like Taproot Assets seek to bring tokenization – specifically stablecoins – to one of Bitcoin’s most popular current L2s: the lightning network.
“With numerous projects vying for attention and liquidity simultaneously, the Pareto principle suggests that only a select few will emerge as successful projects in the coming years, similar to patterns observed on other smart contract platforms,” Grayscale wrote.
Given Bitcoin’s underdeveloped smart contract ecosystem, Grayscale believes it could be a massive untapped market. For example, while roughly 17% of Ethereum’s total market cap ($360 billion) is currently used in applications, the value locked in Bitcoin dapps is still just 0.2% of its total market cap ($1.2 trillion).
“If the latest wave of development results in more adoption for these use cases, it would imply a larger addressable market and potentially a higher market value over time,” Grayscale concluded.

Pepe hits all-time high, memecoins soar after famous GameStop stock trader ‘returns’

Pepe (PEPE) price topped the $0.000010 level for the first time since March 15. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, and TradingView shows that PEPE rallied 34% over the past 24 hours to set a new record high of $0.00001119 on Binance.PEPE/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewPEPE’s trading volume has jumped 245% over the last 24 hours to $1.56 billion and its market capitalization has also jumped to $4.31 billion, surpassing that of Ethereum Classic (ETC) to become the 23rd largest cryptocurrency by market value.PEPE’s performance follows the return of “Roaring Kitty” – Keith Gill’s account on the social media platform X – which has been dormant since June 2021. On the night of May 12, the account posted an image of a man holding a controller and moving to sit forward in his chair as if to focus. Users on X and Reddit interpreted it as Gill saying it was a period of “locking in,” a colloquial term for a period of intense focus or concentration.Source: TheRoaringKittyGill was at the center of the 2021 meme stock frenzy when shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment, among others, surged more than 1,000% by the end of the year.

The latest rally has seen PEPE rise above a critical resistance level, which has underpinned the price since March.

Who Is Roaring Kitty, and What Does His Return Mean for Crypto? - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFinancial analyst turned stock and meme influencer Roaring Kitty has roared back onto social media. His return to Twitter on Sunday didn’t even directly mention GameStop—the stock whose rollercoaster ride sparked global headlines and a documentary film—but nonetheless prompted the price of GME to double briefly and preceded a 1,900% surge in a Solana-based tribute coin also named GME.What’s the connection between Roaring Kitty—whose real name is Keith Gill—the failed video game retailer, and meme coins?Gill is no fringe character. He was the subject of the 2023 film “Dumb Money,” which told the story of the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, after his stock analysis and campaign to promote GameStop stock largely started the fire that engulfed Wall Street in 2021—and led him to testify on Capitol Hill.He announced his return with a single tweet on Sunday with an image of a man sitting up in his seat, holding a video game controller with a look of keen interest on his face.It was his first tweet in over 150 weeks. And it was enough to fuel another maelstrom in both crypto and traditional investing circles.Who is Roaring Kitty?Before he took the financial sector by storm as Roaring Kitty (or DeepFuckingValue on Reddit), Gill dreamed of being a track and field star and even appeared in an edition of Sports Illustrated, according to the Wall Street Journal. Gill’s first foray into creating content on YouTube was posting a 4:33 mile run, where he lost a bet to beat 4:30.While his dreams of racing stardom failed to pan out after an injury, Gill shifted his focus to the stock market. In 2019, Gill became a director of financial wellness at life insurance company MassMutual. That same year, he joined Reddit and began posting on the WallStreetsBets subreddit.Gill gained widespread fame for his role in the GameStop short squeeze that occurred on January 27, 2021. Under his "DeepFuckingValue" account on Reddit, he earned a following for his investment in GameStop’s stock, his advocacy for the asset on social media, and his Roaring Kitty YouTube channel.“FYI these positions are up in March,” Gill wrote in a Reddit post in 2020. “GME has been crushing the market on a relative basis.”The stage was set.GameStopAt the time, the gaming retailer had been struggling financially, and many institutional investors and hedge funds believed its GME stock was overvalued, taking short positions on the GameStop stock. Short positions are an investment move where investors borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference.At the time, a share of GME stock was worth about $5.16. Before the GameStop surge started, its share price was way down from its prior all-time high.Users on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, including Gill, noticed the rising number of short positions being placed on GME, sensing an opportunity to trigger a short squeeze. A “short squeeze” is when the price of an asset rises sharply, prompting traders who had bet on its price falling or “shorting” to liquidate or sell their positions.While not single-handedly behind the GameStop short squeeze, Gill was a prominent figure in the conversation, having previously gone against the grain and deeming GameStop undervalued.“People talk up the demise of GameStop, yet here they are about to generate over $2 billion in [revenue] in a single quarter at the tail end of a console cycle,” Gill, writing as DeepFuckingValue, wrote on Reddit. “The ‘shift to digital’ thesis is way overblown. This business model has legs, and the new consoles will be a major tailwind.”As the price of GME rose, several firms that had bet against GameStop were forced to close their positions, including Melvin Capital, which lost nearly $3 billion for its GameStop shorting. SkyBridge Capital CEO Anthony Scaramucci compared the GameStop short squeeze to the French Revolution.On January 28, the day after the GameStop short squeeze took place, Robinhood—the platform of choice for the legion of retail investors—was hit with two lawsuits after the trading platform blocked customers from purchasing more GameStop stock during its historic one-day run.At the time Robinhood blocked the purchase of GameStop, the stock had already reached $492—but soon fell to $193.The AftermathOn February 18, 2021, Gill was called to testify before the U.S. Congress House Committee on Financial Services. Joining him at the hearing were the CEOs of Robinhood and multinational hedge fund Citadel.“It is true that my investment in that company multiplied in value many times. For that, I feel enormously fortunate.” Gill said during the virtual hearing. “I also believe the current price of the shares demonstrates that I've been right about the company.”Dispelling any notion that he was a cat, Gill also told the members of Congress that he is also not an institutional investor or a hedge fund.“I do not have clients, and I do not provide personalized investment advice for fees or commissions,” he said. “I'm just an individual whose investment in GameStop, and posts on social media are based upon my own research and analysis.”Gill called the idea that he could use social media to promote GameStop stock and influence the market preposterous.“My post did not cause the movement of billions of dollars into Gamestop shares,” Gill said. “It is tragic that some people lost money and my heart goes out to them. But what happened in January just demonstrates again that investing in public securities is extremely risky.”Gill’s last Reddit post is dated April 16, 2021. He quietly left social media on June 18, 2021, after posting a video of sleeping cats on Twitter.It would be another 151 weeks before Roaring Kitty returned.After the frenzy around the GameStop short squeeze fizzled out, the stock's price returned to earth. Currently, it is trading at $36.90.GameStop did try to capitalize on the renewed interest in its business, even going so far as to make a push into cryptocurrency and NFTs. But the company’s crypto aspirations were short-lived as the firm shut down its NFT wallet in August 2023 citing regulatory uncertainty, and its NFT marketplace in January of this year.The GameStop short squeeze and Roaring Kitty’s part in the chaos were the focus of both a documentary and a feature film. In September 2022, Netflix launched the streaming mini-series “Eat the Rich: The GameStop Saga,” which was followed in 2023 by the feature-length film “Dumb Money” starring Paul Dano as Roaring Kitty and Pete Davidson as Gill’s brother Kevin.The ReturnNews of Roaring Kitty’s return inspired social media influencers like Andrew Tate dumping Bitcoin to invest their money in GameStop stock and meme coins. For his part, Tate said he would sell $500,000 in Bitcoin to invest in the latest GameStop short squeeze.“I’m taking Wall Street down, watch me,” Tate said. "Fuck ‘em. Fuck ‘em all.”“Hey bro, what we buying?” Crypto Influencer Ansem asked in response to a Roaring Kitty tweet.Even Barstool Sports founder David Portnoy was also ready to jump in.“You wanna get nuts [Roaring Kitty] let's get nuts!” Portnoy wrote on Twitter. “Every time I think I'm out they pull me back in!” he said, quoting a line from the Godfather Part III.It's unclear why Gill chose Sunday to return to Twitter—his Reddit and YouTube account are still fallow as of this writing—and whether he will resume tweeting after posting a dozen times until 8 p.m. ET on Monday. He did not respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.But his reemergence has stirred the meme coin market, which rose 5.4% for the day, with several meme coins, including Dogecoin, Shibu Inu, and Pepe, up 5.7%, 5.0%, and 15.4%, respectively.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Binance Receives Approval to Operate in India, Joins KuCoin as Second Offshore Crypto Exchange Cleared by FIU



                    

Binance, the global cryptocurrency exchange, has recently received approval from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in India, allowing it to offer services in the country. 



This development positions Binance as the second offshore crypto exchange to receive such regulatory approval, following KuCoin.




In a CoinDesk report, FIU head Vivek Agarwal stated, “Binance is now a registered entity.” 



The approval comes after Binance, along with KuCoin and other major exchanges like Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfinex, were issued non-compliance notices by Indian authorities in December 2023. 



The Indian Finance Ministry had subsequently directed its IT department to block access to these platforms in mid-January 2024.




These regulatory challenges prompted several exchanges to seek compliance with FIU requirements to continue operating in India.



While KuCoin and Binance successfully navigated the regulatory landscape to reinstate their services, others such as OKX and BitStamp opted to cease operations within the country.

In response to India’s stringent tax laws on cryptocurrency—comprising a 30% tax on gains and a 1% tax deduction at source on each transaction—many Indian investors turned to foreign exchanges like Binance. At its height, Binance handled 90% of crypto trading volume from India. 




The Indian market’s heavy tax burden led to a significant migration of crypto traders and businesses to more favorable regulatory environments abroad. 



Consequently, the remaining crypto exchanges in India faced difficulties in building trust with investors, further hampered by the absence of robust banking solutions.



Despite these challenges, India remains a key market for major cryptocurrency exchanges. 



However, the regulatory uncertainty and stringent tax measures have cooled its appeal on the global crypto stage. 



As of the latest updates, Cointelegraph has reached out to both Binance and FIU for comments but has not received any response yet.

Tether CEO Responds To Brad Garlinghouse’s Comments


								In a recent podcast interview, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that Tether, the largest Stablecoin issuer by market share, is next on the US government’s target list. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, refuted Garlinghouse’s comments and accused him of spreading fear.

Is Tether Next In Line?
Ripple’s CEO joined Quantum’s founder, Chris Vasquez, for his World Class podcast on May 10. During the interview, he discussed his outlook for the future of crypto and his thoughts on the US government’s crackdown on the industry.


Regarding unforeseen circumstances, Garlinghouse believes the crypto market has shown remarkable resilience despite the adversities. The CEO used the downfall of FTX and the immense regulatory scrutiny that Binance has faced over the last couple of years to back his point.
Two years ago, FTX and Binance were two of the most influential companies in the industry. Similarly, their founders and CEOs, Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, were some of the most important players in crypto, as Garlinghouse highlighted.
Since then, SBF has been sentenced to 20 years in prison, while CZ has stepped down as Binance’s CEO and was recently sentenced to a four-month incarceration. To Ripple’s CEO, these events would have been impossible to predict, adding that black swans are “hard to know” as unpredictability is part of the event’s nature.
Despite this, he considers what the community and industry have endured over the years shows a positive side, as the “freaking resilience of this industry and market (…) should give us immense optimism about what’s coming.”
Garlinghouse believes there will be another Black Swan.  He also stated that it would be “an interesting one to watch,” despite not being sure what it could be.
To him, it’s clear that the “US government is going after Tether.” Ultimately, he added that a crackdown on the company could have a big impact due to its “important part of the crypto ecosystem.”
Tether’s CEO Responds
On Monday, Paolo Ardoino took X to respond to the comments. The CEO called Garlinghouse “an uninformed CEO,” and suggested that he was spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) about USDT.
Ardoino seemingly took the comments as an attack from someone “leading a company being investigated by the SEC, launching a competitive stablecoin.”  As a result, he decided to update the community on the safety of Tether’s ecosystem.


The CEO highlighted USDT’s status as “the most used stablecoin in the world, with hundreds of millions of users across primarily emerging markets and developing countries.”  Moreover, he added that most mainstream media reporters refuse to report data regarding Tether’s global compliance work.
Ardoino’s post listed various factors that affect Tether’s compliance. These included Tether’s collaboration with 124 law enforcement agencies across 40+ countries, its respect for the OFAC / SDN lists, and its blockage of over $1.3 billion related to scams, hacks, money laundering, and terrorist financing.
To the CEO, the refusal to share Tether’s statistics sets a “sensationalistic” narrative against the usage of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies worldwide, likely to protect the old guard of the financial establishment.
Garlinghouse responded to the post, clarifying his intentions behind the comments. He explained that he wasn’t attacking the stablecoin issuer. Instead, he pointed out that the US government had “clearly indicated they want more control over USD-backed stablecoin issuers.”
Thus, Tether’s status as the largest player in the sector made it “first in line” for a regulatory crackdown.

Dogecoin Investors Shift to New GambleFi ICO, Chasing Potential 895% Returns / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Dogecoin bulls were in charge on Monday amid a surge in meme coin risk-taking in wake of Roaring Kitty’s return to social media, but investors are nonetheless shifting funds to a new GambleFi ICO called Mega Dice as they hunt for 10x or 895% gains.Dogecoin gained 5% on Monday and was last trading just under $0.15, 10% up from earlier session lows.Legendary GameStop investor Roaring Kitty, who was a key leader of the meme stock movement of 2021, triggered a spike in meme coin and meme stock sentiment when he made his first post on X since 2021.His return triggered a chorus of calls that a new meme coin season might now be here.But the Dogecoin chart gives little reason for that kind of optimism right now.The Dogecoin price remains stuck near its 21DMA and substantially down versus its 50DMA.And the price is arguably also in the process of forming a bearish descending triangle from its late-March highs.A break below $0.12 support would open the door to a quick drop back towards $0.10.With Dogecoin potentially headed back under $0.10 soon, investors are turning to new GambleFi ICO Mega Dice as they hunt upside. Source: TradingViewCan Dogecoin Reach $1?
However, given it remains the undisputed king of meme coins, Dogecoin is a strong bet this bull market.Dogecoin could feasibly 6.5x from current levels to hit $1, fulfilling a long-term prophecy of many of its community members.At $1, Dogecoin’s market cap would be over $140 billion.That’s a lot for a token that doesn’t have much utility beyond as a collector’s item and independent blockchain.Few would expect Dogecoin to 10x or more. Investors looking to turn bigger profits, of 20-50x for example, should check out an often overlooked investment strategy – presale investing.Web3 projects frequently sell their tokens at a big discount to early investors as they raise funds for development.If presale investors can find a good projects that end up gaining decent traction in the market, they can book huge profits.One presale project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is new GambleFi ICO Mega Dice Casino.
Dogecoin Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice (DICE)
Mega Dice is an already well-established crypto casino that recently launched a presale of its utility token, DICE.With over 10,000 active monthly players and over $50 million wagered monthly, Mega Dice’s big user base ensures demand for DICE will be strong.That’s evident in the huge success of the project’s presale, which is closing in on raising $1 million.Investors need to move quickly, as when the $1 million mark is hit, the DICE price will rise from $0.069.At $0.069 per token, DICE is valued at a very modest $29 million market cap. That’s very low considering the amount of real-world adoption Mega Dice’s platform is already garnering.With Mega Dice already a market leader in GambleFi, its coin could one day be worth over billions of dollars. This could easily be a 50-100x coin.In terms of what DICE holders can expect to get – big cashback benefits on their wagers and an impressive passive income via staking.The new GambleFi ICO is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors. Mega Dice is also running a referral scheme.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presalehttps://twitter.com/megadice/status/1787530056979341365

Historical cycle data suggests Bitcoin has left the ‘danger zone’ - Analyst

Bitcoin (BTC) may have escaped the post-halving “danger zone” — and is now headed for reaccumulation, according to a crypto analyst citing historical data. On May 13, crypto market analyst “Rekt Capital” posted an update to his Bitcoin market cycle chart on X declaring that the “danger zone” when the asset corrects after the halving event is now over. Bitcoin is celebrating with a “good bounce from the re-accumulation range low support,” he added. The periods of pre and post-halving “danger zones” have occurred in previous market cycles when the asset retreats on either side of a halving event.In this cycle, BTC fell 23% from its peak price in mid-March to $56,800 on May 1 marking the potential bottom of the post-halving danger zone period. The analyst added that if $56,000 was not the bottom, “then this current pullback will have officially equaled the longest retrace in this cycle at 63 days.” However, history suggests that this current pullback ended at $56,000 and 47 days, he opined. Source: Rekt CapitalBTC has now recovered to trade back above $63,000 at the time of writing, supporting the return to the re-accumulation zone analysis. However, historical cycle movements aren’t always indicative of future ones, and further pullbacks during the period of sideways chop that often follows the halving could still be on the cards. The analyst, however, was confident that current support levels would hold. “Bitcoin is showing early-stage signs of slowing down in its sell-side momentum, slowly developing a curl against the ~$60,000 support,” This level needs to hold as it has been doing so far for it to eventually lift up again which could result in a move back to $68,000, he added. Related: Bitcoin ‘as strong as ever’ with record high 200-day moving averageMeanwhile, in a May 13 post to X, Global Macro Investor founder Raoul Pal said “Macro Summer and Fall are driven by the global liquidity cycle,” with crypto performing particularly well in what he termed a “banana zone” in the latter half of the year when prices of these high risk assets surge. Source: Raoul PalEarlier this month, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes concurred that a period of sideways trading and accumulation is likely to occur before markets start moving again later this year.He also cited an injection of liquidity from Federal Reserve monetary policy which could make its way into riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Is The Crypto Winter Thawing? US Bitcoin ETFs Record First Inflows In Weeks - Coinshares


																After experiencing outflows for four consecutive weeks, US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have marked a notable shift in momentum, witnessing net inflows once again.
According to recent data from CoinShares, digital asset investment products have seen inflows totaling $130 million for the first time in five weeks.
This change suggests renewed investor interest in crypto-focused investment products, particularly in the United States, where most of these inflows, totaling over $130 million, occurred.

A Mixed Bag Of Global Investment Flows
Grayscale, a major player in the digital asset space, reported a significant decrease in weekly outflows, recording its lowest since January at $171 million. This trend indicates a potential stabilization in the market after a period of volatility and declining interest.
Meanwhile, interaction between US regulators and spot ETF issuers has remained minimal, particularly for spot Ethereum ETF applications.
This lack of engagement has fuelled speculation that approval for these ETFs might not be approaching, as reflected by the amount of outflows from Ethereum-based products. James Butterfill, Head of Research at Coinshares, particularly noted:
Low interaction by the US regulators with ETF issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF have increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent, this has been reflected in outflows which totalled US$14m last week.
On a global scale, the investment landscape showed mixed signals. After a week of record inflows likely driven by “seed capital” post-Bitcoin ETF launches, as highlighted by Butterfill, Hong Kong saw a significant drop to $19 million in inflows.
Conversely, Switzerland experienced inflows amounting to $14 million. Canada and Germany continued to see outflows, with their year-to-date figures reaching a combined $660 million, indicating sustained bearish sentiment in these markets.
Bitcoin has rebounded with $144 million in inflows, counteracting a generally “weak month.” In contrast, short-Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded outflows totaling $5.1 million, up to $18 million over the last eight weeks.
These figures highlight the volatile dynamics within the crypto market, with Bitcoin currently showing stronger performance than Ethereum.
Bitcoin And Ethereum Market Performance
Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin surged nearly 3%, while Ethereum increased by only 1.2%. Despite these gains, both assets are down by 2.3% and 6% over the past week.

Amidst these market movements, crypto analyst Ali provided insights into Bitcoin’s potential paths. According to Ali, Bitcoin could climb to $76,000 if it reclaims $64,290 as a support level.

                        South Koreans who received airdrop tokens and prizes from the Bithumb crypto exchange from 2018 to 2021 could face unexpected tax bills.Per Hanguk Kyunjae, Bithumb said on May 10 that it would foot the bill for customers who have been ordered to pay taxes on the giveaways.However, the exchange wants to challenge the National Tax Service (NTS)’s decision to retrospectively tax its customers.Bithumb Airdrop Events Hit Hitch?
Bithumb customers have been told to pay a combined total of around $30 million in taxes as a result of winning airdrop prizes and taking part in cashback-type promotions.The NTS thinks that Bithumb gave away almost $61 million worth of assets to South Korean residents in the period 2018-2021.The tax bills have come as a shock to many, particularly as South Korea does not currently tax crypto-related profits.However, the NTS does require the winners of “lotteries and similar events” to declare and pay taxes on their winnings.The NTS classifies these as a form of “other income.” For prizes exceeding around $37, residents must pay 22% of their winnings.Bithumb says that 10,700 of its users were told to pay a total of $15 million in taxes last year alone. This is the first time the NTS has taxed South Korean airdrop recipients.Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko)Free Gifts or Prizes? Exchange to Dispute NTS Decision
Bithumb said that it would “immediately” compensate its customers for anything they had to pay the NTS as a result of receiving its airdrops.However, the exchange announced that it was “filing a tax appeal” against the national tax body.Bithumb argued that “virtual assets and commission cashback distributed via events are a type of free gift or sales benefit.” As such, the exchange said, these are “exempt from taxation.”The media outlet quoted South Korean tax experts as stating that the appeal’s success would hinge on “the nature of the event giveaways.”While the NTS appears to view the tokens as “a prize,” Bithumb insists these are “free gifts.”Legal Process ‘Could Take Years to Resolve’
The exchange may argue, experts noted, that it is following the example of securities providers, who often give out stocks to new account holders.In more conventional cases, shopping outlets that give high-spending customers gift certificates also avoid legal issues. In neither case do recipients pay taxes, experts added.Again, this is because the NTS does not see such handouts as competition “prizes,” but as “free gifts.”The media outlet warned that appeals to the NTS are often time-consuming, concluding that “it may take up to several years for a ruling to emerge.”Bithumb is currently aiming to become the first South Korean crypto exchange to float on the nation’s stock exchange.

Stablecoin Exchange Inflows See Major Drop: Bad For Bitcoin?


								On-chain data shows that stablecoin exchange inflows have seen a sharp drop recently. This could be bearish for the Bitcoin price.
Ethereum-Based Stablecoins Have Seen Low Exchange Deposits Recently
As CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr. pointed out in a post on X, the exchange inflows of Ethereum-based stablecoins have recently dropped below the 90-day average.
The “exchange inflow” here refers to an on-chain indicator that tracks the total amount of any given cryptocurrency being transferred to the wallets associated with centralized exchanges.

When the value of this metric is high, investors are now depositing large amounts of the asset into these platforms. Generally, holders send their coins to the exchanges for trading purposes, so this trend can show high demand for exchanging away the cryptocurrency.
Exchange inflows’ implications for the wider market, though, depend on the type of asset in question. For volatile assets like Bitcoin, inflows may have a direct bearish effect on their prices, as they imply selling is happening.
BTC, in particular, is a major doorway for capital to move in and out of the digital asset sector, so selling it can have cascading effects on the prices of the altcoins.
Selling stablecoins doesn’t affect their prices as they are, by nature, “stable” in value at the $1 mark. Exchange inflows of them are still consequential for the market, however, as they suggest the stable holders are looking to make a swap.
If investors are making the inflows to withdraw into fiat, then the market as a whole would see a bearish effect as it implies a net amount of capital is exiting the sector.
In the scenario that the deposits are being made to purchase Bitcoin and other volatile coins with them, the prices of these assets would register a bullish effect.
The latter may be more likely anytime large stablecoin exchange inflows take place as, generally, investors interested in the sector store their capital in the safety of these fiat-tied tokens, waiting for the right opportunity to buy into the volatile side.
Now, here is a chart that shows what the trend in the exchange inflow has looked like for the Ethereum-based stablecoins as a whole:

The value of the metric appears to have been sharply going down in recent days | Source: @AxelAdlerJr on X
As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day moving average (MA) of the stablecoins exchange inflow has recently sharply declined and fallen below the 90-day MA.

This suggests that stablecoin users have significantly less demand for buying into Bitcoin and others now than during the rally that led to BTC’s new all-time high. “The drop in volume below the quarterly figure is a negative signal,” notes the analyst.
BTC Price
Bitcoin has been attempting another recovery push during the past day, and its price has now returned above the $63,000 mark.

Ethereum: What does ETH's future hold as investors continue to leave? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum’s price fell by nearly 10% in a week.
Technical analysis suggested a possible short-term recovery, with key metrics indicating reduced investor interest.

Ethereum’s [ETH] price has seen a significant downturn, with a nearly 10% drop in the past week and 1% decline in the past day, bringing it to a 24-hour low of $2,868. 
This decline is more pronounced compared to Bitcoin [BTC], which has managed to breach notable price marks despite the current market conditions. 
The downturn in Ethereum’s market performance is attributed to several factors, including massive whale activities that have introduced substantial volatility and selling pressure into the market.
Indicators of declining investor interest in Ethereum
Further compounding Ethereum’s market woes are the declining metrics of network activity. 
According to AMBCrypto’s look at Glassnode’s data, Ethereum’s active addresses have decreased from a peak of 564,868 in late April to 468,548 as of press time. 
Source: Glassnode
This decline in active addresses is paralleled by a drop in the number of new addresses—from 196,629 earlier in the month to below 85,000 on the 11th of May. 
These metrics highlight a waning investor interest in Ethereum during this period.
Source: Glassnode
From a technical analysis perspective, Ethereum has broken significant support structures on the daily chart, indicating bearish pressure. 
The 4-hour chart revealed that, at press time, there was liquidity near the $3,200 region that needed to be taken before any major downward continuation. 
This suggested that Ethereum could experience a short-term rise above the $3,000 mark before potentially dropping to around the $2,800 level, setting the stage for a potential rally thereafter.

Black Donald Trump Surges 600% Before Consolidating, As Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP), a Solana memecoin that was launched yesterday, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Black Donald Trump presents a similar opportunity.



BLATRUMP rallied over 600% in the first few hours after its launch, before consolidating as some early buyers cashed out their profits.



However, most investors are still holding their tokens, as they are waiting for BLATRUMP to be listed on ByBit later this week, as this listing will cause the coin’s price to skyrocket.




Its current price presents a great opportunity for new investors to buy the dip before the next rally. 



BLATRUMP has a market cap below $30,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of around $500,000-$1,000,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-3,000% in a matter of days or hours. 



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally another 12,000% in the coming two days, and Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, BLATRUMP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for BLATRUMP by entering its contract address – 29BiHVTBEo7RnbtwqwTmV3Hy6nDTadcCgopM6HUyjGRK –  in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BLATRUMP.

Polygon (MATIC) Labs Head of DeFi Jumps Ship, Joins Berachain - DailyCoin


        

Last week, Polygon (MATIC) Labs Head of DeFi Jack Melnick disclosed that he was leaving the firm.



Melnick has now disclosed a new role at the Cosmos-based Berachain.



Despite the move, Melnick has asserted that he maintains a positive outlook on Polygon.




Another Polygon (MATIC), Labs executive has jumped ship. 



In recent months, the project has weathered an onslaught of key executive exits to competing projects, from its president in November 2023 to its head of business development in January 2024. Now, the firm’s former head of DeFi, Jack Melnick, has followed suit after announcing that he was leaving last week.



Melnick Announces New Role



In an X post on Monday, May 13, Melnick disclosed that he was starting his first day as head of DeFi at Berachain: a Cosmos-based EVM compatible project that tries to address liquidity concerns that can arise from the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model through a novel consensus model dubbed Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL). 




Explaining the rationale behind his decision, Melnick suggested that the move to Berachain was a long time coming.



“I’ve been in the trenches of the Berachain community for almost three years, and as [Berachain co-founder] @SmokeyTheBera used to say: ‘it’s when, not if’ I came on full time.



Grateful to have found the ulitmate [sic] culture & work fit – getting to do the job I love, with friends I’ve built alongside and respected for years,” he enthused.




Melnick first announced that he was stepping down from his role at Polygon (MATIC) Labs on Thursday, May 9, stating that he remained “excited about the things getting built on Polygon.”

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Struggles with Investor Outflows Despite May Influx



                    

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), experienced a brief resurgence in investment inflows in early May, following a substantial period of financial hemorrhaging since its inception. 



Despite this, the fund quickly reverted to outflows within just a few days, reflecting its ongoing struggles in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.




GBTC debuted on January 11 and suffered consistent outflows for 78 consecutive days, resulting in a total loss of over $17.5 billion. 



A temporary reversal occurred in early May, with inflows recorded on May 3 and May 6, totaling $63 million and $3.9 million respectively. 



This influx of investment briefly suggested a potential stabilization or renewed investor interest in the fund.




However, this trend did not sustain. By May 7 and May 9, GBTC reported outflows of $28.6 million and $43.4 million respectively, effectively negating the gains made in the previous days. 



This pattern of rapid reversal is indicative of the challenges faced by GBTC, marking it as the only spot Bitcoin ETF issuer to report outflows during that period while other funds under the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) saw positive or neutral investment flows.



In contrast, other Bitcoin ETFs have fared significantly better. 



For instance, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust attracted substantial investment, totaling nearly $15.5 billion.

Other notable funds include Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, and Cathie Wood’s ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, which reported net inflows of $8.1 billion, $1.7 billion, and $2.2 billion respectively.



Despite these fluctuations, the average daily loss for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust since its launch stands at a stark $211 million. 



Nonetheless, the overall Bitcoin ETF market in the U.S. has maintained a positive net balance of $11.7 billion due to robust inflows into other funds.



Adding insight into the investor demographics, Jan VanEck, CEO of VanEck, commented during the Paris Blockchain Week in April that “You’ve had some Bitcoin whales and some other institutions move some assets in, but they were already exposed to BITCOIN.” 



He further noted the predominant retail investor contribution, which accounts for 90% of Bitcoin ETF inflows. 



Despite this, there is an anticipation for significant institutional investments from banks and traditional firms as projected around May.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Edge Higher On Spot ETF Holdings Disclosure And 'Roaring Kitty' Frenzy: Analyst Says $66,250 Next Hurdle For Bitcoin Before A New All-Time High - Benzinga

Top cryptocurrencies of the market lifted upward Monday, spurred by top banks' disclosure of investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs, and a social media post by retail trader "Roaring Kitty" that sent meme coins flying.CryptocurrencyGains +/-Price (Recorded 8:30 p.m. EDT)Bitcoin BTC/USD+2.19%$63,021.64Ethereum ETH/USD+0.48%$2,952.36Dogecoin DOGE/USD+4.72%$0.1488What Happened: Bitcoin, the most valuable digital asset on the planet, rose above $63,000 after a subdued weekend. The disclosure of spot ETF holdings by banking titans such as Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase last week likely acted as the major trigger. About $56 million in positions was wiped out in the last 24 hours, with nearly equal amounts of longs and shorts liquidated.The uptick in spot prices drove investments in the derivatives market, as Bitcoin's Open Interest went to upwards of $30 billion, following a 2.94% increase over the last 24 hours.The world's largest meme coin, Dogecoin, bounced 4.73% in the last 24 hours as popular retail trader Roaring Kitty posted a meme on social media after a nearly three-year absence.The level of "Greed" in the market surged, according to Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index, an indication that buying pressure might improve in the days ahead.Top Gainer (24 Hour)CryptocurrencyGains +/-Price (Recorded 8:30 p.m. EDT)Ethena (ENA)+4.10%$0.8947Lido DAO (LDO)+3.11%$1.97UNUS SED LEO (LEO)+2.61%$5.93The global cryptocurrency market cap stands at $2.3 trillion, increasing by 1.42% in the past 24 hours.Major stock indices closed lower on Monday.

Investors Bet on Solana as SOL Investment Products Lead Altcoin Inflows, Data Shows | Cryptoglobe


                                
Cryptocurrency investment products saw inflows of $130 million over the past week, with Solana ($SOL) leading institutional investment among the altcoins it’s possible to get exposure to via these products.



According to CoinShares’ latest Digital Asset Fund Flows weekly, investment products offering exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin saw inflows of $144 million, while products offering exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization Ethereum (ETH) saw outflows of $14.4 million as ETH keeps underperforming when compared to BTC itself.



Meanwhile products offering exposure to multiple digital assets saw $3.4 million of outflows, and were followed by those offering exposure to Binance’s BNB, which saw $400,000 of outflows. Products shorting BTC also saw $5.1 million of outflows.



Altcoins saw significant inflows with Solana-focused investment products seeing $5.9 million of inflows, bringing their total year-to-date flows to $17 million. Polkadot (DOT), XRP and Litecoin (LTC) investment products followed suit, with $1.2 million, $600,000 and $100,000 inflows respectively.



CoinShares noted in its report that exchange-traded product trading volumes were of just $8 billion, compared to the $17 billion average seen during April. Per the firm, these volumes show ETP investors are “participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present.”







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The firm added that Ethereum-based investment products likely saw outflows as low interaction by Us regulators with spot ETF issuer applications for Ethereum funds has “increased speculation” that the approval of these ETFs isn’t imminent.



Investors are seemingly more optimistic about Solana, based on a survey of 64 investors with a total of $600 billion in assets under management. It’s worth noting that Solana’s price is up over 470% over the past year as it saw a major surge, but it has lost around 33% of its value over the last 30 days.



As CryptoGlobe reported, a popular cryptocurrency analyst known in the space for accurately predicting the cryptocurrency market bottom during the 2018 bear market, has recently said the price of Solana is “gearing up for a violent breakout.”



Notably, earlier this month Solana whales started buying up memecoins amid a recent cryptocurrency market downturn that has seen the prices of these assets plunge.

Bitcoin dominance tops 50% amidst market volatility: What's next? - AMBCrypto



BTC remained the most dominant asset despite recent declines.
BTC rose above the $61,000 price range.

Bitcoin [BTC] prices have been fluctuating, moving in and out of the red zone, highlighting the lackluster trend it has been experiencing. 
Despite these fluctuations, Bitcoin dominance has managed to stay above 50%, albeit with marginal changes.
 This sustained dominance above the 50% mark has also influenced the overall trend of the cryptocurrency market capitalization.
Bitcoin dominance remains at over 50%
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Bitcoin’s dominance data from CoinMarketCap indicated that towards the end of the previous year, BTC dominance dropped below 50%, signaling a decrease in BTC’s market cap. 
However, at the onset of 2024, the market cap regained the 50% threshold and continued to rise. As of the last recorded data on 11th May, BTC dominance stood at over 53%.
Source: CoinMarketCap
It’s worth noting that CoinMarketCap calculates data weekly. As for the 24-hour data from Crypto Rank on 12th May 12th, BTC dominance had fallen to around 50%. 
However, within the last 24 hours, BTC dominance has increased by approximately 0.4%, bringing it back to over 51% at this time. 
This translates to around 51% of the total crypto market capitalization.
Bitcoin market cap maintains a $1 trillion threshold
Analysis of the crypto market capitalization trend on CoinMarketCap revealed that it stood at around $2.3 trillion at press time. 
Recent data indicated a reduction in market cap over the past few weeks, with a decrease of over 2% in the last 24 hours. Declines in the prices of various crypto assets primarily drive the decrease. 
Also, following a period in 2022 where the market capitalization fell below the $2 trillion mark, it re-entered this range around March and has since remained there, albeit with fluctuations. 
Further examination of the data highlights that out of the total $2.3 trillion market capitalization, Bitcoin accounts for over $1.2 trillion. 
Also, despite market fluctuations, the price of Bitcoin has managed to hover around $60,000. 
This ensured that its market capitalization remained above the $1 trillion mark for an extended period, allowing Bitcoin dominance to remain above 50%.
BTC makes push above $62,000
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the Bitcoin daily timeframe price trend indicated that it has surged above the $62,000 price zone. It was trading at around $62,500 at the time of writing, with an increase of over 1%.
 This marked the first return to this price range in the last three days.

Should this momentum persist, BTC may test its short-term resistance level at around $64,000. 
However, it’s worth noting that it remained in a bear trend according to its Relative Strength Index (RSI) at press time.

Crypto Firm Falcon Labs Settles ‘Unregistered Activities’ Case With CFTC For $1.7M | Bitcoinist.com


								The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has taken action against crypto brokerage firm Falcon Labs, a company based in the Seychelles, for failing to register as a futures commission merchant (FCM) in the US. 
Interestingly, this marks the CFTC’s first enforcement action against an unregistered futures commission merchant involved in providing “unauthorized access” to crypto exchanges.
Falcon Labs Faces CFTC Crypto Crackdown
Under the CFTC order, Falcon Labs is required to immediately cease acting as an unregistered FCM, specifically by facilitating US individuals’ access to digital asset derivatives trading platforms. 
In addition, Falcon Labs was ordered to pay a disgorgement of $1.7 million and a civil penalty of $589,000, the latter in recognition of the company’s cooperation with the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, as described in the order.

Ian McGinley, the Director of Enforcement at the CFTC, emphasized the agency’s commitment to maintaining integrity in the derivatives markets and ensuring compliance with registration requirements. He stated: 
The CFTC’s enforcement program has made clear it will not tolerate digital asset exchanges that fail to register with the CFTC or comply with the agency’s rules that maintain integrity in the derivatives markets,” said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. And now the CFTC is taking the fight one step further by, for the first time, charging an intermediary that inappropriately facilitated access to those exchanges. Today’s action highlights that the CFTC will not hesitate to charge any entities—exchanges or intermediaries—who are providing customers access to digital asset products and services that require registration but have failed to appropriately register. 
‘Unregistered Activities’ In Crypto Derivatives Market
The CFTC’s order reveals that from around October 2021 through at least March 27, 2023, Falcon Labs solicited and accepted orders for digital asset derivatives from US-based customers. 
Acting as an intermediary, Falcon Labs facilitated customer trading on various digital asset exchanges, including institutional customers in the United States.
According to the CFTC, Falcon Labs provided direct exchange access by creating a main account in its name and associated sub-accounts. Notably, the sub-account holders’ customer-identifying information was generally not required by the exchanges, nor provided by Falcon Labs.
During the period in question, Falcon Labs collected net fees totaling approximately $1.1M from customers engaging in crypto-derivative transactions facilitated by the company. 

Following the CFTC’s complaint against Changpeng Zhao, Binance Holdings Limited, Binance Holdings (IE) Limited, Binance (Services) Holdings Limited, and Samuel Lim in 2023, Falcon Labs reportedly increased its controls for identifying customer locations.

New daily Runes etched on Bitcoin falls 99% from post-halving peak

The number of new Runes etched on Bitcoin daily has fallen below 250 for the last six days, with 157 Runes etched on Monday marking a 99% fall from its peak in late April. The fall comes after a highly successful streak that came a week after launch, which saw an average of 14,700 new Runes etched each day between April 26-30, including a record 23,061 etched on April 26, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard created by RUNES.IS.New daily Runes etched on Bitcoin since April 20. Source: Dune AnalyticsRunes is a new token standard that launched at the fourth Bitcoin halving block on April 20. The protocol allows memecoin and nonfungible token enthusiasts to inscribe and etch their favorite artwork, images, audio and videos onto the Bitcoin network.It initially provided a much-needed revenue boost for Bitcoin miners looking to mitigate the impact of the recent halving, which saw the block subsidy halve to 3.125 Bitcoin (BTC) — worth $196,800 at current prices.However, the 157 Runes etched on May 13 only contributed $3,835 in transaction fees to Bitcoin miners, far less than the hundreds of thousands of dollars that miners were receiving every day in late April. A total of $4.5 million in transaction fees have been paid to Bitcoin miners since Runes launched on April 20 — coming out at about $189,00 each day.A little over 91,200 Runes have been etched on Bitcoin so far.Runes still make up the bulk of transactionsDespite the fall in the number of Runes etched, Runes transactions continue to make up the majority of transactions in May, which were largely taking place on marketplaces such as Magic Eden, OKX, Ordinals Wallet, and UniSat.Key statistics from the Runes protocol from May 13.

GameStop sparked the 2021 memecoin bull run - will history repeat itself?

The sudden and unexpected return of Keith Gill — the man widely credited with kicking off the 2021 GameStop short squeeze — has speculators asking one question: Are we in for GameStop 2.0?Many are hopeful, but at least one analyst has his doubts.Gill was at the center of the GameStop saga during the pandemic, which saw Reddit traders flip the table on hedge funds that had been making money shorting what they believed to be a failing brick-and-mortar game store — which ended up sending the price of GME soaring over 1,000% in under a month. Some also believe the GameStop short squeeze laid the groundwork for a massive surge in the price of memecoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) after retail turned its attention elsewhere.Gill went dark on social media on June 19, 2021, but returned after a nearly three-year hiatus on May 13, posting a typically cryptic meme of a gamer sitting up in their chair to announce his comeback. In the 24 hours following Gil’s return to X, shares of GameStop rallied as much as 111%, while DOGE and SHIB gained 6.2% and 5.4% respectively in the same time frame. Comparative price action of GME, DOGE, and SHIB since May 5. Source: TradingViewNow, crypto enthusiasts are pinning their hopes that Gill’s return will spark a similar breed of retail mania.One analyst isn't so bullishHowever, eToro market analyst Josh Gilbert told Cointelegraph that it probably won’t be that easy this time around. “I think it will certainly ignite some short-term moves from these assets, but it's hard to see any longevity,” he said. Additionally, Gilbert noted that the outstanding shorts on assets like GameStop were much smaller compared to 2021 meaning that the “size of the move to the upside” would likely be smaller as well. “The environment is just not comparable to 2021, when interest rates were at rock bottom, governments were providing fiscal stimulus globally, and major economies had little to no inflation.”“We have 5.5% interest rates in the US and there is a global cost of living crisis going on. Simply, consumers are unlikely to be in the same position as they were in 2021 and that has a huge impact on financial decisions,” Gilbert added. Crypto enthusiasts offered a more simple thesis for their bullishness. Pointing to a recent integration between Robinhood and decentralized exchange UniSwap, pseudonymous trader Travis said it was reasonable to expect a new wave of GameStop degens to start buying memecoins and other cryptocurrencies by way of the app.“Just a reminder you can trade memes on Robinhood now. You think the Roaring Kitty army isn't going to buy these things?”However, Gilbert said among many other factors, most investors are now clued into how speculative rallies end up and are more likely to exercise a much higher degree of caution.Source: Trader Travis“I think we’re in a completely different position from where we were in 2021, which makes me think a similar rally would be unlikely,” he said. “That said, the 14.5 million users on WallStreetBets have shown in the last few years that anything is possible.”Several GameStop-related memecoins including a coin named GameStop (GME) — which bears no official affiliation with the company — spiked massively amid the unfolding drama. The GME memecoin soared more than 3,650% in a single day, per Birdeye data. A GameStop-themed meme oin spiked massively on the news.

                        The UK government’s Insolvency Service has shut down a London-based crypto advisory firm that claimed to offer investment advice in cryptocurrencies.In a London High Court ruling on April 30, Amey Finance Academy Ltd was ordered to close. The company’s sole owner and leader, Desmond Amey (42), who presented himself as a wealth creation specialist, had previously assured customers that their cryptocurrency investments were safe.Despite Amey’s assurances, customers allegedly lost money in their investments, according to a statement on Monday. This lack of positive returns raised red flags.

Established in Dec. 2018, Amey Finance Academy advertised itself on social media as “an established and successful independent consultancy providing a plethora of financial services.” The company also claimed to operate a leading education academy within the industry, the Insolvency Service said.However, Amey made false assurances, guaranteeing one customer who later lost all their invested funds that their investment would not fall below 90%.In WhatsApp messages investigators reviewed, Amey assured another customer that the investments were “100 certy” and urged them to “trust me bro.” Additionally, Amey Finance Academy promoted crypto schemes conducted by other firms such as HyperFund, which raised over $1.7b from investors globally.Chief Investigator Exposes Founder’s Deceptive Crypto Schemes
Further, Amey posted a video on YouTube in Oct. 2023, suggesting that the office still maintained a presence at 1 Canada Square in Canary Wharf, London. However, he had actually been evicted earlier that year in January due to rent non-payment.“Desmond Amey used Amey Finance Academy to recklessly persuade individuals to invest in cryptocurrency schemes and mislead them about the risks of doing so,” said Mark George, the Insolvency Service’s chief investigator.He also mentioned that the service couldn’t determine the company’s full activities, assets, liabilities. Nor could it ascertain the handling of £5m ($6.2m) from Oct. 2019 to March 2022 due to insufficient accounting records and lack of transparency.“The public deserve protection from companies trading in an opaque and objectionable manner which is why we applied to have Amey Finance Academy shut down,” George said.Earlier this year, the UK’s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) took down 43 websites suspected of crypto phishing scams. The NFIB’s investigation uncovered a fake email address designed to trick Blockchain.com customers. This spoofed address aimed to exploit security weaknesses and steal cryptocurrency.

                        The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has reached a settlement with Falcon Labs, Ltd., a Seychelles-based entity, for operating as an unregistered futures commission merchant (FCM) and facilitating access to digital asset exchanges without proper registration.CFTC Settlement Terms and Fines Against FalconUnder the settlement terms, Falcon Labs must cease acting as an unregistered FCM, particularly in providing US individuals access to digital asset derivatives trading platforms. Additionally, Falcon Labs has been ordered to pay $1,179,008 in disgorgement and a civil monetary penalty of $589,504.The reduced penalty reflects Falcon Labs’ extensive cooperation with the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement throughout the investigative process.Ian McGinley, the CFTC’s Director of Enforcement, emphasized the agency’s unwavering commitment to upholding integrity in derivatives markets, particularly in the digital asset space. He said,“The CFTC’s enforcement program has made clear it will not tolerate digital asset exchanges that fail to register with the CFTC or comply with the agency’s rules that maintain integrity in the derivatives markets.”McGinley highlighted the CFTC’s determination to hold accountable any entities, whether exchanges or intermediaries, that provide access to digital asset products and services without appropriate registration.As an intermediary, Falcon Labs facilitated customer trading on various digital asset exchanges, including institutional customers within the US. The company provided direct access to exchanges by creating main accounts in its name and establishing associated sub-accounts, often without requiring or providing customer-identifying information.Throughout this period, Falcon Labs amassed net fees totaling approximately $1,179,008 from customers engaging in digital asset derivative transactions intermediated by the company.Notably, Falcon Labs took voluntary steps to enhance its customer identification controls following the CFTC’s complaint against entities associated with Binance, which shed light on similar practices involving sub-accounts for U.S.-located customers trading digital asset derivatives.CFTC is Mostly Having Its Way
In last year’s precedent-setting decision, a US district judge ruled in favour of the US CFTC in its litigation against Ooki DAO, ordering the organization to pay a civil penalty of $643,542 and cease operations in the US. The court’s ruling establishes that DAOs can be held liable for violating the law, challenging the notion that their decentralized structure insulates them from legal consequences.The background of DAOs reveals them as organizations operating based on blockchain rules and smart contracts, enabling decentralized decision-making without a central authority. The case of Ooki DAO last year has echoed broader regulatory trends, as evidenced by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s subpoena of Sushi DAO, another decentralized organization behind a crypto exchange.With this recent landmark settlement, the CFTC seeks to encourage other digital asset intermediaries operating unlawfully to come forward and report their activities as required. Director Ian McGinley said,“In recognizing Falcon Labs’ substantial cooperation and remediation in this order in the form of a lower penalty, the CFTC hopes to encourage other digital asset intermediaries operating illegally to come forward and report their activities to the agency.”

USDt-TON hits $200 million circulation in record time, signaling high demand.



Tether and TON Foundation partnership enables USD₮ and XAU₮ integration on the Ton blockchain.



TON network surpasses $200 million TVL, with initiatives like The Open League driving engagement and adoption.




USDt-TON has hit an adoption milestone, hitting a circulation of $200 million within a month of issuance. This growth sets a new record for the fastest token circulation in Tether’s USDt’s history and highlights the growing demand for USDT within the TON ecosystem.



TON announced this achievement via Twitter, stating, “$USDt – $TON reaches $200M in circulation in less than a month after launch, setting a new record as the fastest growing launch in the history of Tether.”



The Tether and TON Foundation partnership was disclosed during the Token2049 crypto conference in Dubai on April 19, signaling an advancement in stablecoin integration. 



“Tether Tokens USD₮ and XAU₮ are now live on the Ton blockchain & available in the 



@telegram wallet.” Tether posted via X. 



The partnership aimed to allow the use of USDT and XAUT for peer-to-peer payments on the TON blockchain, targeting Telegram’s 900 user base. To assure users, the TON blockchain emphasized the simplicity and speed of cross-border payments on its network, likening it to sending a text message on Telegram. 









Meanwhile, the TON network recently made another headline in the crypto arena. Data from DefiLlama revealed that the network surpassed the $200 million mark in Total Value Locked (TVL) over the past week. This figure bettered March’s TVL value of $22.9 million by 900%, demonstrating substantial growth and adoption within its ecosystem.



Not long ago, TON moved to launch its protocol integrations and unveil The Open League, a move that attracted significant attention in the blockchain arena. This initiative offers prizes totaling over $150 million in TON tokens to the community and projects operating within the TON ecosystem.



Following this launch, the Open League has sparked improved user engagement with the TON blockchain. For context, the league has triggered a 264% increase in TON’s monthly active users (MSUs) to 1.5 million users. According to data from Coinmarketcap, TON trades at $7.05 during press time, representing a 4.15% intraday increase.

Mark Cuban Says SEC Didn't Learn A Thing After Mt. Gox, Applauds Japan's Response: 'They Are Still So Stupid' - Benzinga

Mark Cuban, the billionaire investor and television personality, criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its inaction following the Mt. Gox debacle. Cuban also lauded Japan’s regulatory response to the incident.What Happened: Cuban took to social media platform X, to express his views on the SEC’s handling of the Mt. Gox situation. He contrasted this with Japan’s approach, which he commended for protecting its stakeholders.“The SEC didn't learn sh*t. Not a damn thing when MT Gox happened. They are still so stupid they think the mere process of registration protects investors. The only actions they take are after the fact. See Madoff. See FTX. See Chinese Stocks,” Cuban wrote.See Also: If You Bought Your Mom $100 In Bitcoin, Dogecoin And Ethereum Last Mother’s Day, Here’s How Much She’d Have TodayHe also criticized the SEC’s approach to innovation, stating that it is “completely the opposite of our technology history in the USA.” He further questioned the SEC’s ability to protect investors from scams, suggesting that the regulatory body is “really really bad” at it.Cuban responded to a post by Mike Kelly, which questioned the potential of 65 tokens in Japan to be breakthrough applications. Cuban pointed out that even the “scammiest of the scammiest tokens” haven’t caused as much loss as other investments.Why It Matters: Cuban’s criticism of the SEC’s regulatory approach comes amid a broader debate on the regulation of cryptocurrencies. In a recent exchange with James Love, Director of an NGO Knowledge Ecology International, Cuban highlighted the various benefits of digital assets, including minimal transaction fees, easily accessible credit, and insulation against theft.Meanwhile, the Mt. Gox incident has been a long-standing issue in the cryptocurrency space. The exchange, once the world’s leading Bitcoin BTC/USD exchange, suffered a devastating hack in 2011 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in 2014. However, there is now a glimmer of hope for creditors, with some reportedly receiving updates on their claims.At the same time, the SEC’s regulatory approach has been a source of frustration for many in the crypto space. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev recently expressed his disappointment with the SEC’s response to the company’s efforts to engage with the regulatory body.Read Next: Bitcoin Clinging On To $60K, Ethereum, Dogecoin Bleed: ‘Bitcoin’s Final Move Will Be The Most Aggressive,’ Predicts TraderImage Via Shutterstock Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh BagalkoteThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

Joe Biden Blocks Chinese-Owned Crypto Mining Firm - MineOne


On May 13, The President of the United States, Joe Biden, issued a directive prohibiting MineOne from acquiring real estate near a strategic missile base. The US government found that MineOne, mainly owned by Chinese nationals, aimed to use the property for crypto mining.
This decision stems from national security concerns due to the site’s proximity to Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. The base hosts Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles.
National Security Concerns Prompt Presidential Action
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) saw risks in the foreign-owned, specialized equipment at the site.

“The proximity of the foreign-owned Real Estate to a strategic missile base and key element of America’s nuclear triad, and the presence of specialized and foreign-sourced equipment potentially capable of facilitating surveillance and espionage activities, presents a national security risk to the United States,” the President’s order reads.

As a result of these findings, the transaction has been prohibited. MineOne and its affiliates must sell or transfer all ownership interests in the property within 120 days. Additionally, they must remove all equipment and improvements from the site within 90 days and certify the completion of these actions.

MineOne and its affiliates are restricted from accessing the property throughout this period and must ensure compliance with the order. They must also provide weekly updates to CFIUS until all conditions are met.
The Department of Treasury issued an official statement following the President’s order. In the statement, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen emphasized that this order shows President Biden’s commitment to protecting national security.

“It also highlights the critical gatekeeper role that CFIUS serves to ensure that foreign investment does not undermine our national security, particularly as it relates to transactions that present risk to sensitive US military installations as well as those involving specialized equipment and technologies,” Secretary Yellen added.

Furthermore, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Investment Security Paul Rosen reiterated that CFIUS expects complete, accurate, and timely information from involved parties. He also stressed that failure to address national security risks would prompt decisive actions, including Presidential interventions.
This order follows the Department of the Treasury’s proposed 30% tax on electricity consumption by crypto mining firms as part of the Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue Proposals. This proposal aims to mitigate the environmental impact of the crypto mining industry’s rising energy demand.
Under this scheme, crypto mining firms must report the quantity and cost of electricity consumed, including off-grid power production. The tax will be introduced gradually, starting at 10% and reaching 30% by the third year, effective January 1, 2025.
Biden’s Crypto Policies Stir Controversy and Industry Reaction

The Biden administration’s tougher stance towards the crypto industry is further evidenced by its position on H.J. Res 109, a resolution to nullify the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. This bulletin requires financial institutions to include customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets, which the crypto community sees as burdensome.
The White House has clarified that rejecting this rule would weaken the SEC’s investor and financial system protections. President Biden is ready to veto the resolution.
In response to the current regulatory environment, industry players are rallying to support pro-crypto political candidates. Coinbase has created a new political action committee (PAC) named “Stand With Crypto” to support crypto-friendly candidates financially.
Coinbase’s PAC has garnered support from various parties, including Moonpay, a fintech platform that supports crypto transactions. Moonpay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright emphasized the importance of advancing crypto innovation.


“This year’s election will define the future of our industry in the United States, and it is our responsibility to step up and stand alongside those organizations that want to positively advance crypto innovation for everyone,” Soto-Wright stated.

Also, prominent crypto community figures, such as Mark Cuban and Hayden Adams, have warned that Biden’s current stance could impact the upcoming elections. The warning aligns with a recent report from the Blockchain Association. The report indicates that one in five US voters considers crypto a key issue, with many distrusting candidates who interfere with crypto.

Crypto exchange OKX launches local regulated entity in Australia

Crypto exchange OKX is moving its Australian-focused services under a locally regulated entity as part of its expansion efforts through the Asia-Pacific region.Oscar Piastri of McLaren Racing — one of OKX's main sponsors —officially announced the news at a media event in Sydney on May 14.“Australian crypto users deserve a platform that is secure, easy-to-use and response to their needs, which include seamless access to banking rails as well as AUD pairs for the most popular cryptocurrencies,” OKX Australia general manager Jamie Kennedy said in a statement shared with Cointelegraph.170 crypto trading pairs will be available to Australian users, OKX noted.Options trading would also be available in addition to spot trading, Kennedy noted.Source: OKXOKX president Hong Fang says Australia offers a “dynamic customer base” for the firm, including both sophisticated traders and others that are interested in crypto but haven't taken the first step yet.OKX told Cointelegraph it was opening an Australian office in March last year, explaining there was a “huge appetite” for crypto and it saw the country as “a key growth market.”The exchange’s Australian-focused services since March 20 moved from a Seychelles-based firm to the on-shore entities OKX Australia Pty Ltd which handles the crypto exchange and fiat services side, and OKX Australia Financial Pty Ltd which handles its derivatives and margin products.However, Australian laws dictate that local users must pass a suitability assessment and meet the definition of a wholesale client — a legal requirement under the Corporations Act 2001.Despite the regulatory hurdles, Fang praised Australian regulators for engaging with them in an open and transparent manner.Related: Australia’s top exchange may approve spot Bitcoin ETFs this year: ReportOKX has also had to stop offering its copy trading, yield-bearing products and trading of some tokens to comply with local laws.

New Filing Reveals What Ripple Wants To Hide From The Public


								In a court filing on May 13, 2024, Ripple Labs has formally requested the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to seal various documents that were submitted in connection with the SEC’s Motion for Judgment and Remedies. These documents, collectively referred to as the “Remedies Materials,” contain sensitive financial data, including audited financial statements, revenue, expenses, and other confidential business information.
Breaking Down Ripple’s Request To Seal
Ripple’s legal counsel, Andrew J. Ceresney of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, articulated in the letter to Judge Analisa Torres the rationale behind the request. Ceresney’s argument focuses on the potential damage to the company’s competitive position, noting, “Public disclosure of this information would be highly detrimental because it would reveal detailed information about Ripple’s financial condition, long-term business plans, revenue streams, and expense structures to the marketplace, including competitors, customers, and future business partners and customers.”
A core objective of Ripple is to seal the discounts offered to institutional buyers of XRP. The motion lays out three main reasons to justify their request for sealing.
Protection of Highly Confidential Financial Information: Ripple emphasizes the critical nature of the documents it seeks to seal, particularly its audited financial statements and related materials.

According to Ceresney, “The documents and information are non-public and their disclosure would cause significant harm to Ripple’s business interests and competitive standing.” He argues that these documents contain sensitive financial metrics that are vital to maintaining the company’s proprietary strategies and competitive position in the marketplace.
Preservation of Negotiating Power: Another significant aspect of the request is to protect the details of its financial terms negotiated with third-party business partners. The company asserts that revealing the XRP sale terms could compromise its competitive position and adversely affect its negotiating capabilities in future deals.
The motion details the potential repercussions, noting, “Revelation of the financial terms of its contracts with counterparties and customers […] could result in serious damage to Ripple’s negotiating position with future counterparties, and would cause competitors to adjust their sales plans and pricing policies to compete with Ripple in the marketplace.”

This section underscores the concern that such disclosures could not only harm its individual bargaining power but also provide competitors with unjust insights into the company’s strategic operations.
Ensuring Privacy of Non-Parties: Ripple also seeks to redact the identities of non-party entities like XRP investors, customers, and business partners, asserting that their privacy should be protected as their identities and contact information are irrelevant to the legal issues at hand and could be misused if disclosed.
The motion articulates, “The identities of these non-parties have no bearing at all on the Court’s resolution of the Remedies Motion and therefore their privacy interests outweigh the presumption of public access.” Ripple stresses that such disclosure poses unnecessary risks to the individuals and entities involved and does not contribute to the resolution of the case.
Ripple’s legal team also points out that the SEC has not opposed several of the sealing requests, which might play in favor of their motion. Citing previous cases where the court granted similar requests for sealing and redaction, the motion suggests that there is a strong precedent supporting their request.
Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan commented, “a company has every right to seek to protect commercially sensitive information. In this situation, the need for Ripple to even apply to seal information on discounts arises from the SEC putting this in evidence and its weak argument that pecuniary harm is suffered by a sophisticated institutional investor […].”
At press time, XRP traded at $0.507.

                        Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, is grappling with a “system-wide outage” that has rendered its services inaccessible to users on both desktop and mobile platforms.The exchange officially announced the outage on its status page, alerting users to a “major outage” that began at 4:15 am UTC on May 14.As a result, attempting to visit the Coinbase website currently displays a “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” error message.“Coinbase experiencing a system wide outage. We are investigating this issue. Your funds are safe,” the message on its status page reads.Coinbase Might be Experiencing an Overload
According to a developer guide from Mozilla, this error message commonly indicates that the servers are either undergoing maintenance or experiencing overload.Coinbase Support took to social media to acknowledge the issue and assure users that they were actively investigating and working towards a solution.They reiterated that users’ funds remained safe despite the disruption.This is not the first time Coinbase has faced temporary outages.On February 28, along with several other exchanges, Coinbase experienced service disruptions due to a surge in crypto trading activity.While such outages are undoubtedly frustrating for users, some individuals in the cryptocurrency community leverage these incidents to fuel a bullish narrative, suggesting that the heightened activity causing the downtime ultimately benefits the market price.Although the outage duration and the underlying cause have not been specified by Coinbase, the company is expected to provide updates as they work to resolve the issue and restore full functionality to its platform.KBW Increases Coinbase Price Target to $230
Last month, investment banking firm KBW hailed Coinbase for offering investors a unique opportunity to tap into the long-term growth potential of the crypto economy and increased its price target for COIN to $230.In a research analysis, KBW raised its Coinbase price target from $160 to $230 while maintaining its market performance rating. Meanwhile, Coinbase has also faced its fair share of regulatory trouble.Last month, Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the US District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase can proceed.The Judge’s decision came after Coinbase filed a motion to dismiss the SEC case, which borders on allegations the exchange operates as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.In her ruling, Judge Failla declared that the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase held “plausible” ground. “The Court finds the SEC has sufficiently pleaded that Coinbase operates as an exchange, as a broker, and as a clearing agency under the federal securities laws, and through its Staking Program engages in the unregistered offer and sale of securities,” the court document read.As reported, Kathryn Haun, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney and partner at Andreesen-Horowitz, has stepped down from Coinbase’s board.

                        OKX, a world-leading digital asset exchange, has officially launched its operations in Australia, a year after it established an office in Sydney in May 2023.Announced Tuesday, the launch would enable spot trading for all users and derivatives trading for verified wholesale clients in Australia.The move arrives months after the exchange’s subsidiary received in-principle approval for a payments license to operate in Singapore. The exchange also launched its operations in Turkey, this February.Adding on to its expansion spree, OKX’s Australian launch aims to provide trusted, compliant, and transparent gateway to crypto trading and decentralized finance (DeFi).“As part of our long-term commitment to the Australian market, we look forward to continuing to improve our offering to better serve the local crypto community,” the exchange wrote on X.With the launch, OKX claims to be the largest global crypto exchange offering direct AUD deposits and withdrawals to Australians.As of now, spot trading users have access to 170 crypto spot pairs and a total of 85 tokens including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and Tether, the release added. The OKX’s Australian arm plans to add more tokens in the coming months.“Australian crypto users deserve a platform that is secure, easy-to-use and responsive to their needs, which include seamless access to banking rails as well as AUD pairs for the most popular cryptocurrencies,” Jamie Kennedy, general manager at OKX Australia, noted.Australia’s Growing Crypto-Hungry Population
One of the key reasons for crypto exchanges to choose this smallest continent is due to its crypto-hungry population. According to a survey from Koinly reported that as many as 31.6% of Australians held or had held crypto as of July 2023.Additionally, crypto ownership in Australia has consistently increased since 2019, in a way that 1 in 4 adults own some type of cryptocurrency.On the other hand, Australia had intensified scrutiny on crypto exchanges lately, demanding data from 1.2 million accounts. A move to crackdown on users failing to pay their taxes amid a rising interest in crypto tokens.Further, ASX, the country’s market operator, is eying to approve the first-ever Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the end of 2024. As a result, this would trigger a surge in Bitcoin investment options among Australian users.

                        VanEck’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) experienced significant growth in the first quarter of 2024.According to VanEck Bitcoin Trust’s recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the HODL Bitcoin ETF saw an increase of $109 million in net asset for the first fiscal quarter of 2024, which concluded on March 31.Bitcoin ETF’s Gains and Ethereum ETF’s Anticipated Rejection
The filing also indicated that HODL held 8,711 BTC, costing $515 million and valued at $619 million. The ETF also reported liabilities of $20 million and a net realized gain of $6 million. Additionally, the fund had 8.2 million shares outstanding as of April 30, 2024.The SEC approved VanEck and 10 other Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, 2024, marking a historical milestone for the cryptocurrency industry.VanEck CEO Jan van Eck expressed skepticism about the SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs during a CNBC interview on April 9. He indicated that he expected his firm’s application to likely be rejected.VanEck and Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest were early to file for Ethereum ETFs in the United States. They are both awaiting a final decision, due on May 23 and May 24 respectively.Advisor Expresses Concerns and Criticism
Previously on March 27, VanEck advisor Gabor Gurbacs criticized current crypto regulations for stifling innovation.Gurbacs’s concerns were sparked by the instability in the crypto industry, which he attributed to inadequate regulatory frameworks, especially following the SEC’s delay in potentially approving the Ethereum ETF applications.“I am personally unhappy with how regulators in developed markets managed the first decade of digital asset regulation,” said Gurbacs. “They manage to simultaneously enable scammers, hamper actual innovation and protect incumbents on the expense of those building better systems.”“It’s not excusable or tolerable to prioritize personal/political interests and senseless bureaucracy over national interests and capital formation. Not ever but particularly not in the economic condition where the world is now,” stated Gurbacs.

'Roaring Kitty' Comeback Makes Cat-Themed Coins Explode: ROAR Shoots Up Over 500% - Benzinga

The "Roaring Kitty" mania rippled across the meme coin market, causing coins themed on kitty avatars to soar to unprecedented heights. What Happened: Coins, which had nothing to do with either Roaring Kitty — the social media nickname of retail trader Keith Gill — or Gamestop, the company at the center of the well-known short squeeze in January 2021, began climbing solely due to the buzz surrounding the word “Kitty.”CryptocurrencyGains +/-Price (Recorded at 12:30 a.m. EST)Roaring Kitty ROAR/USD+545%$0.001459Kitty Coin Solana KITTY/USD+126%$$0.0009446Kitty AI DOGE/USD+10.6%$0.0002691Ethereum-based Raoaring Kitty was the largest gainer in the memecoin space, exploding 545% over the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Similarly, Solana-based Kitty Coin Solana was up 126% in the said timeframe, ranking as the third-best-performing coin in the space.Amid these astronomical gains, on-chain tracking site Lookonchain revealed how a trader purchased a large amount of KITTY moments before the tweet from Roaring Kitty–the event that sparked the euphoria. The "lucky" trader then sold a significant portion of his stash when prices pumped, leading to a massive 32x jump in profits.Why It Matters:  The phenomenon reaffirmed the volatile and speculative nature of meme coins, requiring just a social media post to swing wildly.While they appear enticing to a lay investor during periods of hype, questions remain regarding the sustainability of the surge. It would be interesting to observe how long these new kitty-themed tokens can keep their upward trend.Image Courtesy: PixabayIt was observed that the more established meme coins seem to show greater resilience during weak markets.Read Next: GameStop Stock Pumps, But What About The GameStop Meme Coin?Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Daily Bitcoin Rune Etchings Plummet by 99% Since April Peak

                        The number of new Runes etched on Bitcoin daily has experienced a drastic decline, falling below 250 for the past six days.The drop is particularly notable, with only 157 Runes etched on Monday, marking a staggering 99% decrease from the peak witnessed in late April, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard created by RUNES.IS.The decline follows a highly successful period that occurred a week after the launch, during which an average of 14,700 new Runes were etched each day between April 26 and 30.This impressive streak included a record-setting 23,061 Runes etched on April 26.Rune Etchings Decline After Halving Peak
Runes, a new token standard, was introduced at the fourth Bitcoin halving block on April 20.The protocol enables memecoin and non-fungible token enthusiasts to inscribe and etch their favorite artwork, images, audio, and videos onto the Bitcoin network.Initially, it provided a much-needed revenue boost for Bitcoin miners seeking to offset the impact of the recent halving.The block subsidy was halved to 3.125 Bitcoin (BTC), equivalent to $196,800 at current prices.However, the decline in Rune etchings is evident, with the 157 Runes etched on May 13 contributing a mere $3,835 in transaction fees to Bitcoin miners.This is a significant drop compared to the hundreds of thousands of dollars miners were receiving daily in late April.Since its launch on April 20, a total of $4.5 million in transaction fees have been paid to Bitcoin miners, averaging approximately $189,000 per day.The current count stands at over 91,200 Runes etched on Bitcoin.Despite the decrease in Rune etchings, Runes transactions continue to dominate the majority of transactions in May.These transactions primarily take place on popular marketplaces such as Magic Eden, OKX, Ordinals Wallet, and UniSat.Runes, introduced by Ordinals inventor Casey Rodarmor, aims to utilize blockspace more efficiently than its main competitor, BRC-20s, as outlined by Binance Research.Unlike BRC-20s, Runes are compatible with Bitcoin’s unspent transaction output (UTXO) model, allowing UTXOs to hold balances of arbitrary fungible tokens like Runes.Developers Hit Back at Runes
Last month, Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr criticized the Runes protocol, suggesting it exploits a fundamental design flaw within the Bitcoin blockchain network.In his post, Dashjr highlighted the contrasting nature of Ordinal Inscriptions and the Runes protocol in their interactions with the network.He explained that while Ordinals exploit vulnerabilities within Bitcoin Core, the Runes protocol operates within the existing framework of the network’s design flaws.In response to his opposition to Runes, Dashjr suggested methods for filtering out transactions related to the protocol.He recommended adjusting the “datacarriersize” setting in the bitcoin.conf file to zero, which would effectively block Runes’ spam.However, early indications suggest that miners are not following this advice.The popularity of the Runes protocol led to Bitcoin transaction fees reaching an all-time high average of $128 on April 20, coinciding with the fourth Bitcoin halving.

The platform identified PEPE as one of several coins to keep an eye on, with substantial volatility likely in the coming days. Large PEPE transactions worth more than 100,000 jumped more than 5x in the last 24 hours, while the daily active addresses more than doubled, according to IntoTheBlock.Price Action: At the time of writing, PEPE was exchanging hands at $0.000009989, following a 15% bump in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Edge Higher On Spot ETF Holdings Disclosure And ‘Roaring Kitty’ Frenzy: Analyst Says $66,250 Next Hurdle For Bitcoin Before A New All-Time High

                        Security firm CertiK said it has detected and prevented a flaw in the cross-chain bridge Wormhole which could have resulted in $5 million worth of losses.In a social media post, CertiK said its research team found a critical bug in Wormhole — an incorrect application of the public and entry modifiers exposing the blockchain to potential multimillion-dollar exploits.In a short video explainer, CertiK runs through how it detected the flaw in the network.  CertiK said this case study not only underscores the critical role of proactive security practices but also celebrates the power of open-source software in raising security and transparency standards across the Web3 world.Wormhole supports the transfer of tokens and data across different blockchain networks. The crypto project was spun off by Jump Trading Group and is one of the most popular bridges linking the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.Wormhole Experienced the Largest DeFi Attack in 2022
In 2022, Wormhole lost about $321 million in an exploit. Hackers compromised Wormhole Bridge leading to 120,000 wETH loss from the platform, equivalent to $321 million. It was the largest DeFi attack of 2022 and the hacker swapped wETH tokens with Ethereum, SOL, USDC, APE, SX, etc.An investigation conducted by pseudonymous researcher Pland, detailed in an X post on April 4th, revealed that the Wormhole team overlooked excluding several wallet addresses associated with the exploit that drained $321 million in crypto from the cross-chain bridge.Chainalysis said to understand why the 2022 attack was more serious than the average hack, it is important to know how cross-chain bridges work.“Users interact with cross-chain bridges by sending funds in one asset to the bridge protocol, where those funds are then locked into the contract.

Can Ethereum Price Repeat Pattern and Start Fresh Surge To $3,200?


																Ethereum price is attempting a recovery wave from the $2,865 support. ETH might start a fresh surge if it clears the $2,960 resistance zone.

Ethereum remained stable and attempted a recovery wave above $2,900.
The price is trading below $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $2,930 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).
The pair could start a major increase if there is a close above the $2,990 and $3,000 resistance levels.

Ethereum Price Holds Support
Ethereum price traded as low as $2,864 and recently started an upside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH was able to rise above the $2,900 and $2,920 resistance levels. Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $2,930 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.
The price even spiked above $2,980 and tested $3,000. A high was formed at $2,992 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a minor move below the $2,960 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $2,864 swing low to the $2,992 high.
Ethereum is now trading below $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $2,950 level and another connecting bearish trend line on the same chart. If the bulls push the price and repeat the recent breakout, the price might start another increase.
The first major resistance is near the $3,000 level. The next key resistance sits at $3,050, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,120 level.

Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com
If there is a clear move above the $3,150 level, the price might rise and test the $3,220 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,250 resistance zone.
Another Failure In ETH?
If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,950 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,2930 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $2,864 swing low to the $2,992 high.
The first major support is near the $2,900 zone. The next support is near the $2,865 level. A clear move below the $2,865 support might push the price toward $2,740. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,650 level in the near term.
Technical Indicators
Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.
Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.
Major Support Level – $2,865
Major Resistance Level – $2,950

Bracebridge Bets Big in Bitcoin ETFs, Now Largest ARKB Holder


A recent SEC filing revealed that Bracebridge Capital has invested $363 million in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This Boston-based hedge fund has hefty stakes in the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).
This move highlights the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency.
Institutional Investments in Bitcoin ETFs Surge Amid Heavy Outflows
Bloomberg Intelligence data reveals Bracebridge Capital holds $262 million in ARKB, $81 million in IBIT, and $20 million in GBTC. The data further shows that Bracebridge Capital is the biggest holder of ARKB.
This is particularly noteworthy given that Bracebridge manages funds for endowments for Yale University and Princeton University. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, commented on Bracebridge Capital’s significant investment.


“The new high water mark (authorized participants/market maker) for Bitcoin ETF holdings has arrived. […] They went wild. If you manage money for the Ivys, you are as pro as it gets,” Balchunas wrote.

A few days before this revelation from Bracebridge, another SEC filing unveiled that traditional banks are also jumping on the spot Bitcoin ETFs bandwagon. The Switzerland-based investment bank, UBS Group AG, invested $145,692 in IBIT (3,600 shares) through its subsidiaries and institutional investment managers. Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) S.A., the family-owned banking giant, also owns $4.2 million in IBIT shares and $82,121 in GBTC shares.
Bracebridge Capital, UBS, and Rothschild’s moves align with a trend among institutional investors. BeInCrypto recently reported that the Susquehanna International Group had invested over $1.1 billion in various Bitcoin ETFs.

New York-based asset manager Hightower has also ramped up investments in Bitcoin ETFs. Hightower’s investments totaled $68.35 million across spot Bitcoin ETFs.
However, James Seyffart, another ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, cautioned the crypto community to be careful about identifying recent Bitcoin ETF ownership trends.

“Just FYI, everyone. JPM, Susquehanna (which also owns these ETFs and was all over this site last week), and others are just market makers and/or [authorized participants] APs. Their ownership isn’t necessarily indicative of anything other than this is how many shares they had on March 31, 2024,” Seyffart explained.


Despite the interest from institutional investors, US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs’ performance could have been more impressive in May. According to SoSo Value data, these ETFs recorded only three positive flows throughout May.
On May 3, the daily total net inflow was $378.24 million. Meanwhile, on May 6 and May 8, it was $217.06 million and $11.54 million, respectively. The ETFs saw outflows for the rest of May, with the biggest outflow of $563.77 million on May 1.

Nonetheless, the significant investments by institutions like Bracebridge Capital highlight the growing integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream financial portfolios. While the performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs fluctuates, the increased institutional backing signals long-term confidence in the potential of digital assets.

Biden orders removal of Chinese-owned crypto miner near missile base

United States President Joe Biden has signed an order preventing a China-linked crypto mining firm from continuing to use land near a Wyoming nuclear missile base.The order, released by the White House on May 13, forces MineOne Cloud Computing Investment and its partners to divest property operated as a crypto mining facility near the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming.Biden cited national security concerns for the order to rescind the firm’s property rights. “There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that MineOne Partners Limited, a British Virgin Islands company ultimately majority owned by Chinese nationals [...] might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.”MineOne acquired the property in June 2022 and then made improvements to use it for crypto mining close to the Air Force base. The military installation is a strategic missile base and home to intercontinental ballistic missiles, the order read. The firm and its affiliates are also required to remove all equipment on the site installed after the improvements. The order also prohibits Chinese-linked entities from any further access to the site, which is less than a mile away from the base.The company has 120 days from the date of the order to sell the property and is not permitted to transfer it to third parties. Map showing proximity of MinerOne site, Francis E. Warren AFB, and Microsoft data center. Source: Google MapsRed flags regarding this particular site have been raised in the past by tech giant Microsoft which has a data center nearby. The location could allow the Chinese to “pursue full-spectrum intelligence collection operations,” the Microsoft team wrote in an August 2022 report to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), according to a 2023 New York Times investigation. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who also serves as the chairperson of the committee, said the order to force MineOne to sell the land “highlights the critical gatekeeper role that CFIUS serves to ensure that foreign investment does not undermine our national security.” MineOne raised more than $20 million for its first fund within a month in 2021. Since it launched the fund in October 2021, it was n "actively subscribed" by U.S. institutional investors and high-net worth individuals, according to the announcement at the time.Cointelegraph reached out to MineOne for comments but did not receive an immediate response. Related: China has a Trojan Horse in US Bitcoin mining infrastructureThe Biden Administration has previously ordered a crackdown on the U.S. Bitcoin mining industry citing China as an example to follow as part of its ongoing war on crypto.Crypto mining was heavily curtailed by the ruling regime in China in 2021, initiating an exodus of mining operations, many of which ended up across the pond in the U.S. The latest White House order comes just a day before the Biden administration is set to sharply increase tariffs on several Chinese imports, including electric vehicles.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Economist Henrik Zeberg Says Extreme Rally Ahead for Crypto and Stocks - But There’s a Big Catch - The Daily Hodl


								Closely followed economist Henrik Zeberg is revealing his outlook for stocks and crypto for the coming months.
The macro strategist tells his 139,600 followers on the social media platform X that he believes stocks and crypto are gearing up for big rallies that may endure until the end of the year.










Zeberg points to two narratives that he says bulls will latch on to justify the ascent.
“1. Blow off top is not over and done – yet! Extreme rally ahead in certain indices and crypto.
2. Sentiment will become extremely BULLISH.
3. I will be called ‘Perma Bear’ as I call US market top. Market top very close in outside US.
4. Bulls will point to AI (artificial intelligence) and Fed liquidity to explain why markets can only go UP.”
But while Zeberg believes that more rallies are in sight for risk-on assets, he predicts that both stocks and crypto will implode once the top is in.
“Top in US markets will be in Q3/Q4 2024. 
Recession sets in Q4 2024. 
Fast decline in markets will begin.”
The economist also says market participants will be exuberant as the S&P 500 ascends to greater heights.
“People will become overly BULLISH – right as we approach the top. This bullish sentiment will grow bigger as the S&P 500 heads towards 6,150 [points]. And talk of AI and liquidity – as the reasons why markets only can go UP – will dominate…”
At time of writing, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,221 points.

Is Cardano a 'must-buy' right now? Key points about ADA's 2024 fortunes - AMBCrypto



Social media engagement and user activity have been falling in the past six weeks.
The NVT and mean coin age metrics posed a dilemma to investors.

Cardano [ADA] was unable to shake off its bearish bias. Technical analysis revealed that further losses remained likely for the token.
A lack of demand was a major reason, and bullish sentiment has also been negligible.
Bitcoin [BTC] was unable to break out of the $60.8k-$63.3k region, and Cardano was also stuck within the $0.43-$0.47 area. Do on-chain metrics hint at a bullish breakout, or reinforce the bearish expectations?
Development activity was high but the good news stops there

A high development activity shows that the project is continually fixing issues or otherwise preparing to ship new features.
Overall, it is a good sign for long-term investors, and Cardano did not slouch in this department.
Yet, the other metrics like daily active addresses and social volume have been in a decline since mid-March.
It indicated fewer users were utilizing the network for transactions and that social media engagements had fallen off. Moreover, the Weighted Sentiment has been negative for a good chunk of the past six weeks.
The online engagement has been negative or bearish, which does not bode well for the short-term price prospects. However, these factors alone do not indicate a drop is inbound.
The contradicting signs — is ADA undervalued or not?

The 30-day MVRV ratio has been negative since mid-March, showing an extremely undervalued asset in the short-term.
However, despite this development, the price trend has been bearish. During this time, the mean coin age has trended rapidly higher, showing accumulation in place.
It presented a good opportunity for swing traders to buy, as ADA was also at the range low. Yet, the NVT revealed something else.
The Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio calculated using the daily circulation has also trended higher since mid-March.
This indicated that the network was likely overvalued, or expensive, compared to its low ability to transact tokens. This has bearish implication for the network usage, and in turn, the future demand.

Read Cardano’s [ADA] Price Prediction 2024-25

Therefore, putting these clues together with the technical analysis, it appeared that Cardano is likely headed for more losses.
A Bitcoin breakout might halt or reverse the downtrend, but the evidence at hand was not bullish.

Chainlink's (LINK) Outlook Grows Bleak: Signals of Bearish Continuation Surface


																Chainlink’s LINK price is struggling to surpass the $13.80 resistance. The price could continue to move down if it breaks the $13.00 support.

Chainlink price is showing bearish signs below the $14.00 resistance against the US dollar.
The price is trading below the $13.60 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $13.50 on the 4-hour chart of the LINK/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The price could start a decent increase if it clears the $13.80 resistance zone.

Chainlink (LINK) Price Turns Red
In the past few days, Chainlink saw a steady decline from well above the $13.80 level. LINK price declined below the $13.50 support level to enter a short-term bearish zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

However, the bears were active below the $13.80 resistance and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $14.30 swing high to the $13.07 low. LINK price is still trading below the $13.80 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
Immediate resistance is near the $13.50 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $13.50 on the 4-hour chart of the LINK/USD pair.

More Losses?
If Chainlink’s price fails to climb above the $13.50 resistance level, there could be a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $13.10 level.
The next major support is near the $12.80 level, below which the price might test the $12.20 level. Any more losses could lead LINK toward the $11.50 level in the near term.

US Senators Slam DOJ's Stance on Non-Custodial Crypto Services


Senators Ron Wyden and Cynthia Lummis have raised serious concerns regarding current crypto regulations in the United States. They target the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) recent stance on non-custodial crypto asset software services.
In a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, they argue that the DOJ’s interpretation of federal laws threatens to criminalize Americans offering these services.
Senators Criticize DOJ’s Stance on Non-Custodial Crypto Services
The senators assert that the DOJ’s unprecedented interpretation of the prohibition on operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business contradicts Congressional intent. They also note that it conflicts with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) established guidelines.
They warn this interpretation could stifle innovation in the crypto industry. It could also undermine trust in the rule of law.

Both senators explain that non-custodial crypto services allow users to retain sole possession and control of their crypto assets. This means service providers do not “accept” or control them. Transactions happen on the user’s device without third-party access.
Read more: What Is a Non-Custodial Wallet?
Aligning with the senators’ explanation, FinCEN has held that non-custodial services are not subject to money transmitter registration requirements. This is because they do not involve direct receipt and control of assets.

“Non-custodial crypto service providers cannot be classified as money transmitter businesses because users of such services retain sole possession and control of their crypto assets. At no point when operating or providing non-custodial services do such service providers ‘accept’ crypto assets from their users. Users retain exclusive custody and control over the private keys to their crypto assets. All transactions are signed and processed on the user’s local device without third-party access,” the letter reads.

Furthermore, the letter urges the DOJ “to discard this flawed interpretation of Section 1960” to support the rule of law and foster the development of transformative technologies. In addition to her letter, Senator Lummis shared her thoughts on her X (Twitter) account.


“President Biden’s DOJ steamrolling the longstanding interpretation of FinCEN is legally wrong and threatens to criminalize Bitcoin software development in America,” Senator Lummis wrote.

Although the letter did not name any specific crypto services, many interpret it as referring to the recent case with Samourai Wallet. This platform is a Bitcoin wallet that provides financial anonymity for its users.
BeInCrypto reported that the DOJ charged Samourai Wallet’s co-founders with several financial crimes. These charges include operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business.
Following the charge, US officials arrested Samourai Wallet’s co-founders. They also seized the platform’s operational infrastructure and removed its app from Google’s Play Store in the US.

The DOJ previously charged Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based decentralized crypto mixer, with a similar allegation. In August 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the crypto mixer service. At that time, OFAC claimed that Tornado Cash had been involved in laundering funds worth $7 billion.

Following OFAC’s sanction, the Netherlands Crime Agency (FIOD) arrested Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev in Amsterdam in the same month. FIOD alleged that Pertsev sponsored illicit financial flows, money laundering, and the mixing of cryptocurrencies through the service.
According to the schedule, Pertsev will hear his verdict today. The crypto community keenly awaits the outcome of Tornado Cash’s case. They fear that the outcome may threaten developers of privacy-focused software within the ecosystem.

SEC v. Ripple: Defendant Files Motion to Seal Documents


San Francisco-based blockchain company Ripple has filed to seal or narrowly redact some of its documents in connection with the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s motion for judgment and remedies. Ripple claims that the disclosure of these non-public documents would cause “significant harm” to its business interests. The company wants to seal or redact highly confidential information concerning its earnings, revenues, expenses and so on.In addition, Ripple wants to keep its contractual agreements with thirty-party business partners under wraps. While the Ripple admits that the fact that it offered discounts to institutional XRP buyers is relevant, it it not willing to disclose the specific financial and pricing terms. Ripple has stressed that the redactions are “narrowly drawn” and “warranted” due to their “sensitive” nature. Moreover, Ripple is also seeking to protect the identities of certain non-party financial institutions, customers as well as employees. The disclosure of these identities would be “detrimental” to their “legitimate privacy interests,” according to the filing. This could potentially damage Ripple’s partnerships.As reported by U.Today, the SEC is requesting more than $2 billion worth of fines and penalties from Ripple. However, the defendant insists that the civil penalty should not exceed $10 million. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief lawyer, recently said that the lawsuit was “closer than ever” to its resolution.

Tether Freezes 5.2M USDT On 12 ETH Addresses


							

Tether froze 5.2 million USDT tokens as per a May 14 post from MistTrack.



The tokens were associated with 12 Ethereum addresses.



The addresses might be connected to laundering addresses for phishing groups.




Tether, the firm associated with the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, froze 5.2 million USDT on May 14 as per the data from MistTrack, a crypto tracking and compliance platform. 



In a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), MistTrack stated that the stablecoin firm froze 5.2 million USDT on 12 Ethereum addresses tagged as “USDT Banned Address” by the crypto tracking platform. 



Notably, these 12 addresses may be money laundering addresses for phishing groups. It is a common practice for attackers to withdraw their funds to another platform and use crypto mixers to launder their money. 









Back in November 2023, the stablecoin issuer announced the “largest-ever freeze of USDT in history” while teaming up with digital asset trading platform OKX. Over 225 million USDT tokens associated with 37 wallets were frozen, and the funds were tied to a human trafficking group on Monday.



Further, the stablecoin issuer also froze 41 wallets controlled by those on the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List in December 2023.It is important to note that crypto firms have been actively freezing addresses associated with scammers and hackers. As per earlier reports, Binance and Huobi froze $1.4 million worth of crypto assets that were associated with Lazarus Group’s Harmony Bridge heist in June 2022.

Bitcoin Price Drops Toward $61K as Coinbase Reports System-Wide Outage


																The largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange informed its customers minutes ago that it is experiencing a system-wide outage but also reassured them that all funds are safe.
While it may not be entirely related, the price of bitcoin reacted with an immediate price drop that drove it south by almost a grand.
The Coinbase status page highlighted the issue just a few hours ago, adding that the team has begun investigating it. Minutes ago, there was another update saying they continue to look into the problem.
These “system-outage” warnings came just minutes after more issues, described as “degraded transactions,” in which users reported failures when sending crypto or withdrawing fiat currencies.
After both problems, though, Coinbase wrote that “all funds are safe.”




At the same time these issues came to light, BTC’s price headed south and dropped by more than a grand in minutes. Although these events might not be related, it’s safe to assume that issues with the largest US crypto exchange can impact bitcoin’s price movements.
The asset dropped from $62,700 to $61,450 in minutes. Moreover, BTC is down by two grand from yesterday’s peak at $63,400.

‘Starting To Look Scary Bullish for Bitcoin’, Says Veteran Macro Investor Dan Tapiero | Cryptoglobe


                                
Dan Tapiero’s insights carry significant weight in the financial and digital asset communities. He is the Founder, CEO, CIO, and Managing Partner of 1RoundTable Partners and 10T Holdings, firms that manage over $1.2 billion in investments across 26 private companies within the digital asset ecosystem​​​​. Tapiero’s career spans several decades, beginning as a macro-focused portfolio manager and analyst at prominent investment firms like Tiger Management, Duquesne Capital Management, Steinhardt Management Co., and SAC Capital Advisors​​. His entrepreneurial ventures include co-founding Gold Bullion International (GBI), a precious metals platform that expanded into cryptocurrencies, and the Agricultural Company of America (AGCoA), one of the largest farmland REITs in the U.S. until its sale in 2013​​.



On 14 May 2024, renowned macro investor and digital asset enthusiast Dan Tapiero took to social media platform X to share an optimistic forecast for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. In his post, Tapiero expressed strong confidence in Bitcoin’s potential to surge, indicating that once Bitcoin breaks the $65,000 mark, it could quickly escalate to $90,000 and beyond. He observed a technical pattern known as “sideways overlapping flag type consolidation,” suggesting that Bitcoin’s consolidation phase is nearing its end and preparing for a significant price breakout. Tapiero also remarked on the unpredictability of market catalysts, stressing that the exact trigger for the anticipated surge is unclear but ultimately irrelevant. He concluded with a motivational reminder inspired by fellow investor Raoul Pal, urging followers to seize the opportunity.

Bitcoin Backers Return: Weekly Crypto Investments Bounce Back With $130 Million


								After five weeks of fleeing the digital asset market, investors are cautiously dipping their toes back in, with Bitcoin (BTC) emerging as the clear favorite. A recent report by CoinShares reveals a net inflow of $130 million into crypto investment products, marking a potential turning point after a period of sustained outflows.

US Investors Lead The Charge
The United States emerged as the primary driver of this shift, contributing the lion’s share of the inflows. This trend can be attributed, at least partially, to a slowdown in selling pressure from Grayscale, the world’s largest digital currency asset manager. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) witnessed its lowest weekly withdrawals in five months, further bolstering investor confidence.

Hong Kong Joins The Inflow Party
While the US spearheaded the net inflow movement, Hong Kong also displayed a newfound interest in Bitcoin. Hong Kong-based Bitcoin ETFs attracted nearly $20 million, showcasing a growing regional appetite for the flagship cryptocurrency. However, these inflows paled in comparison to the dominance of Wall Street offerings, which raked in more than $130 million across various Bitcoin-focused products.

ETP Trading Volume Hints At Investor Caution
Despite the positive news surrounding net inflows, the report also highlights a concerning trend – a significant decline in overall trading volume within Exchange Traded Products (ETPs).
Compared to last month’s $17 billion weekly average, the current volume of $8 billion suggests a more cautious approach from investors. Analysts interpret this as a sign that while some are dipping their toes back in, a large portion of investors remain on the sidelines, waiting for a clearer market picture.
Bitcoin Sentiment Rebounds, Ethereum Outflows Persist
The recent price fluctuations within the crypto market appear to have had a contrasting impact on investor sentiment towards Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). Bitcoin, which witnessed a downward spiral of outflows earlier in May due to plummeting prices, seems to be regaining investor favor with the recent inflows.
BTCUSD trading at $61,880 on the weekly chart: TradingView.com
However, the story is quite different for Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency continues to experience outflows, amounting to $14 million last week.
Regulatory Uncertainty Clouds Ethereum’s Future
Analysts point towards the ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum ETFs in the US as a major factor contributing to the outflows. The SEC’s delay in approving spot Ethereum ETFs has fueled skepticism among investors, leading many to believe that regulatory approval may not materialize.
This sentiment has been further solidified by recent enforcement actions taken against Ethereum-related entities like Consensys, Uniswap, and even crypto trading platforms like Robinhood.

Light At The End Of The Regulatory Tunnel?
While the SEC’s current stance remains ambiguous, there’s a potential ray of hope on the horizon. Proposed bills and initiatives in Congress might bring much-needed clarity regarding the regulatory body that will oversee the crypto industry. A definitive framework could significantly impact future market trends and investor confidence.

Stolen Poloniex Ether worth $53M never made it back to the exchange

Over half of the $100 million worth of Ether (ETH) linked to the infamous Poloniex hack from November 2023 has been siphoned via the privacy protocol Tornado Cash.On Nov. 10, 2023, wallets belonging to crypto exchange Poloniex recorded massive unauthorized outflows. Investigations later confirmed that over $100 million worth of ETH was lost to a hack.Despite Poloniex claiming to have identified the hacker weeks later and offering a $10 million bounty, the stolen funds never made it back to the exchange. According to the blockchain security firm CertiK, the incident was likely a “private key compromise.”In response to the suspicious outflows, the exchange had temporarily disabled the compromised wallet.On-chain message from Poloniex to the hacker.

PEPE is at All-Time High: Are Meme Coins Back? | Cryptopolitan

The entire crypto market bounced back, renewing hopes of an altcoin rally. The first and biggest movers this time were meme tokens. Riding on pure memetic energy, Pepe (PEPE) is among the big recoveries in the past day, with a nearly 20% bounce. PEPE reached record valuations, but it will probably stop there. Instead, the community sees the opportunity to enter another price discovery period with no endpoint.PEPE added another 22.95% in a single day and 25% week-on-week. The meme token traded at $0.00001036, an all-time high after recovering a 50% loss. Price moves like this are not impossible at the extremely low price range. But PEPE is more than a pumping token; it is an indicator of energy returning to the crypto market. PEPE is fully launched, with 100% of the supply in circulation. It is also one of the most traded tokens, turning over nearly half its supply in a 24-hour period. The token also finds support from its community, which is dedicated to holding, hence the ability to bounce from lows. Decentralized trading is limited for PEPE, with only less than 1% of all volume happening on Uniswap. Despite this, some PEPE has found its way into smaller DeFi protocols, bridges and lending platforms. PEPE holders may not wish to immediately sell for profit, but instead hold the token as instrumental for future growth, with an even more influential brand.Can PEPE Eat Another Zero?The recent PEPE rally showed no signs of stopping in the past day. The question remains whether PEPE is ready to eat another zero if the altcoin and meme coin boom continues. One of the big boosters for PEPE is that its community expects much more than a short-term pump. The goal is a memetic supercycle, where PEPE becomes even more prominent. In the “frogs vs dogs” war, PEPE aims to become a top 10 token, displacing ShibaInu (SHIB) and even Dogecoin (DOGE).Holders are the key to “eating a zero”, and since PEPE is accessible, it’s easy to add it to hundreds of portfolios daily. Where Does PEPE Get Its Support?PEPE seems to be running on “we are so back” energy. However, the token is supported by several factors. For one, more than 44% of all PEPE trades are concentrated in a single trading pair on Binance, which allows for a quick inflow of liquidity and significant price moves. Almost all big exchanges carry PEPE, except Coinbase spot listing. The asset is now waiting for a new pairing, which may boost volumes and exposure. However, since April 23, Coinbase has carried PEPE perpetual futures, adding to the token’s activity.PEPE has 219,625 holder wallets, of which the top stashes belong to exchanges. For now, PEPE is trading mostly on centralized markets, and is yet to expand into decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. This differentiates PEPE from newer meme tokens, which have no choice but to rely on decentralized pairs. PEPE has been added to Revolut and Crypto.com, boosting exposure even more. This led PEPE to become the third-biggest meme asset after DOGE and SHIB. After the latest rally, the token achieved the biggest 12-month returns of the top 3 meme assets. All-Time High Arrives After Roaring Kitty ReawakensThe meme token boom coincided with a Level 8 social media flareup – the return of Roaring Kitty, the legendary stock picker behind the GameStop short squeeze. While Roaring Kitty is not affiliated to any crypto coin or token, the pure enthusiasm boosted the overall market mood. Let’s not forget that PEPE remains a politically-charged token, even if it seems to ride on pure market speculation. Allegedly, the anonymous @degenharambe is the creative force behind Pepe, which emerged from the swamp of 4Chan memes. The profile may be flagged for sensitive content, which spills over into the meme coin discussion.
https://twitter.com/degenharambe/status/1653605896310734849The token’s price action may thus be completely tied to obscure memes, while carrying a strong anti-corporate ethos.

What Chainlink's rising development activity means for LINK - AMBCrypto



Development activity on Chainlink increased materially in the last few days.
Price of LINK continued to fall as network growth declined.

Chainlink [LINK] has been one of the most prominent infrastructure protocols in the crypto space for quite some time.
One reason for the same would be the rising development activity on the Chainlink network.
A spike in activity
Recent data revealed that Chainlink is at the forefront of GitHub activity in the Real World Assets (RWA) sector, underscoring its dedication to pioneering blockchain solutions for real-world assets.
The surge in development activity for Chainlink could help the protocol improve upon its products and offerings. This, in turn, could improve sentiment towards the network and attract more users.
Source: X
However, overall activity on the network had declined significantly.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Token Terminal’s data revealed that the number of active daily users on the network fell by 66% over the past month.
Coupled with that, the revenue generated by Chainlink dimished by a whopping 90%.
Source: Token Terminal
The price of LINK wasn’t doing that well either. Since the 26th of March, the price of LINK began to see its downfall.
It plummeted from the $20.737 price and began to indicate lower lows and lower highs, which are signs of a bearish trend.
There was no sign of significant positive price action in all of April or May, as LINK’s price failed to push past the $16.041 mark.
LINK would need to test this level multiple times and weaken the resistance before it could possibly aim at a price reversal in the future.
The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) showcased a negative picture as well, as it had declined to -0.13. A falling CMF indicated that the money flowing into LINK had declined materially in the last few days.
Moreover, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) for LINK had also fallen to 42.06 implying that the bullish momentum around the LINK token had waned.

Chainlink’s Network Growth had also declined materially over the last few days, implying that new addresses were losing interest in the token. This could further increase selling pressure.
However, the velocity around LINK continued to surge, which meant that the frequency of LINK trades had grown significantly high over the last few days.

No Ties To OpenAI: Worldcoin Drops 9% As Top Trader Warns


																Worldcoin (WLD) has seen its value plummet by nearly 9% in just 24 hours, with the price settling at around $5.20. This decline aligns with a critical analysis issued by DeFi^2 (@DefiSquared), the current top trader on the crypt exchange Bybit, who has raised concerns about the potential for substantial inflationary pressures and misleading marketing associated with Worldcoin.
Notably, the WLD plunge comes just after OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, announced on Monday its plans to unveil a cutting-edge AI model named GPT-4o. This advanced model boasts the ability to engage in lifelike voice conversations and seamlessly interact across text and images. Worldcoin is usually a beneficiary of OpenAI announcements, but this time WLD price plunged.
Why Worldcoin Is Plummeting
In his analysis shared on X, DeFi^2 expounded on the mechanics behind the rapid devaluation of Worldcoin, emphasizing that the token is suffering from significant daily depreciation due to both emissions and strategic sales maneuvers by the Worldcoin Foundation.
Specifically, the token’s value is deteriorating at a rate of 0.6% each day, driven by the emissions related to grant and operator claims. These tokens, as per DeFi^2’s observation of on-chain analytics, are predominantly sold off almost immediately upon issuance, adding to the downward pressure on Worldcoin’s price.

	Related Reading



Adding to the supply concerns, the Worldcoin Foundation recently declared its intention to offload $200 million worth of Worldcoin to trading firms. This move will effectively increase the circulating supply by an additional 18%. DeFi^2 criticized this decision, pointing out that the tokens, misleadingly attributed to a “Community” allocation, are being sold at a discount to entities that may not prioritize the broader community’s interests, potentially diluting the value for existing holders.
The most critical issue highlighted by DeFi^2, however, pertains to the near future, when unlocks for venture capital and team-related tokens are set to begin. He forecasts that in just 70 days, the supply of Worldcoin will start to inflate at an alarming rate of 4% per day due to these unlocks combined with ongoing emissions. This scenario could unleash nearly $50 million worth of sell pressure daily, profoundly impacting the token’s market price and stability.
DeFi^2’s analysis did not shy away from addressing the perceived misconceptions surrounding Worldcoin’s affiliation with notable tech personalities and organizations. He clarified that Sam Altman, known for his role with OpenAI, has no active involvement with Worldcoin, which operates as a completely separate entity. This point addresses a common misconception that potentially misled investors about the nature and backing of the token.

	Related Reading



Moreover, DeFi^2 drew parallels between Worldcoin’s tokenomics and what he describes as “predatory” economic models that are engineered to disproportionately benefit early investors and insiders at the expense of general retail investors. He noted that similar strategies had been used in the past in the crypto industry, where the manipulation of token supply and market conditions facilitated significant gains for insiders while leaving regular investors exposed to heightened risks and losses.
“Worldcoin realistically might become the greatest transfer of wealth of this entire cycle. Unfortunately, this wealth transfer isn’t in the form of universal basic income as their mission suggests, but instead to the pockets of the team and insiders,” DeFi^2 stated. He added that “the manipulative low float / high FDV design is straight out of the SBF playbook, and directly enriches insiders as they hedge their locked allocations at high valuations pre-unlock via perps / OTC; yet retail somehow sadly still think they’re beating the system trying to push the price up.”
As the crypto community digests DeFi^2’s stark warnings, the immediate reaction has been a surge in trading activity to $666 million (up 104% in the last 24 hours), with investors and speculators likely reassessing their positions in Worldcoin in light of these revelations. At press time, WLD traded at $5.24.

< p >The Hedge Fund Bracebridge Capital invests in Bitcoin ETFs< /p >

Bracebridge Capital, a renowned hedge fund, has made a significant entry into the cryptocurrency market, as revealed by its latest investment documents: it has declared to own $262 million of ARK’s Bitcoin spot ETFs and another $81 million of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs. 
This strategic move underlines the growing acceptance of digital assets among traditional financial institutions and highlights the evolving landscape of investment strategies.

The hedge fund Bracebridge Capital and the investment in Bitcoin ETFs
Bracebridge Capital, known for its conservative approach to investments and focus on fixed income strategies, has surprised many with its substantial investments in Bitcoin ETFs. 
The decision of the hedge fund to allocate a significant portion of its portfolio to Bitcoin ETFs represents a change in its investment philosophy, reflecting the broader trend towards institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.
ARK Invest, led by influential investor Cathie Wood, has been a vocal supporter of disruptive technologies, including cryptocurrencies. 
The ARK Bitcoin spot ETF aims to provide investors with direct exposure to Bitcoin, bypassing the complexities of managing the underlying assets. 
The $262 million investment by Bracebridge Capital in ARK’s Bitcoin ETF signifies a strong confidence in ARK’s ability to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market and offer substantial returns.
Cathie Wood’s reputation for identifying high-growth investment opportunities likely played a crucial role in Bracebridge’s decision. 
ARK Invest has a successful track record with innovative technologies and disruptive industries, which likely reassured Bracebridge Capital about the potential of Bitcoin and the robustness of ARK’s ETF management.

From BlackRock to Ark: implications for the crypto market
In addition to the substantial investment in ARK’s Bitcoin ETF, Bracebridge Capital has also declared an $81 million stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF.
 BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has a significant influence on global financial markets. Its entry into the Bitcoin ETF sector adds credibility and legitimacy to cryptocurrency investments.
The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is designed to offer institutional investors a safe and regulated opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin. The support of a giant like BlackRock provides a sense of security and stability, making it an attractive option for institutional investors like Bracebridge Capital. 
The $81 million investment indicates Bracebridge’s strategy to diversify its holdings in cryptocurrencies by leveraging the strengths of various ETF providers.
The substantial investments by Bracebridge Capital in ARK and BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs reflect a broader trend towards institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. This move is indicative of the growing confidence among traditional financial institutions in the long-term potential of digital assets. 
With more hedge funds and asset managers allocating resources to cryptocurrencies, the market is likely to experience increased liquidity and reduced volatility, making it more attractive to a wider range of investors.
Furthermore, the involvement of reputable companies such as ARK Invest and BlackRock provides a layer of legitimacy to the cryptocurrency market, potentially encouraging regulatory authorities to create more favorable frameworks for cryptocurrency investments. 
This could lead to a more robust and secure investment environment, fostering further growth and innovation in the sector.
Risks, Opportunities and conclusions
While Bracebridge Capital’s substantial investments highlight opportunities in the cryptocurrency market, they also underscore the inherent risks. Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility, and the regulatory landscape remains uncertain in many jurisdictions. 
However, the strategic decision of a conservative hedge fund like Bracebridge to heavily invest in Bitcoin ETFs suggests that the potential gains are considered higher than the risks.
Investors should note that Bracebridge Capital’s move could inspire other institutional players to do the same, potentially increasing demand for Bitcoin ETFs and cryptocurrencies in general. 
This could lead to a virtuous cycle, where increased investments drive up prices, attracting more investors and further fueling the market.
The $343 million investment by Bracebridge Capital in ARK and BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs marks a significant milestone in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. 
This bold move not only highlights the evolving investment strategies of traditional financial institutions, but also underscores the growing legitimacy and potential of digital assets. 
With more hedge funds and asset managers recognizing the value of cryptocurrencies, the market is poised for substantial growth and maturation, paving the way for a new era of financial innovation.

Canada: The Bank of Montreal announces the purchase of Bitcoin ETFs

In a significant development for the cryptocurrency market in Canada, the Bank of Montreal, the country’s fourth largest bank by assets, has disclosed its holdings in a Bitcoin spot ETF. 
This move marks a crucial moment for the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial services in Canada and highlights the growing acceptance of digital assets among traditional financial institutions.

The Bank of Montreal’s ETF holdings in Bitcoin spot in Canada
The Bank of Montreal, known for its conservative approach in the banking and investment sector, has historically maintained a cautious position on the volatile cryptocurrency sector.
However, the recent revelation indicates a strategic change, recognizing the potential and demand for cryptocurrency-related products among its customers. 
Embracing a Bitcoin spot ETF, Bank of Montreal offers its investors a regulated and potentially safer opportunity to invest in Bitcoin, directly influencing the perception and valuation of digital assets.
An ETF Bitcoin spot differs from other financial products related to Bitcoin in that it involves the actual purchase of Bitcoin, rather than derivatives or futures. 
This means that the ETF directly holds Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to the real-time price of Bitcoin without the complexities and risks of managing and storing digital currencies.
For traditional investors, this is a key attraction as it mitigates the risks associated with security of digital wallets, attacks on exchanges, and other operational risks involved in cryptocurrency trading.
The decision of the Bank of Montreal to list its holdings in this ETF could be seen as a response to the growing interest of investors and the increasing legitimization of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. 
In recent years, institutional interest in cryptocurrencies has increased, with numerous global banks, hedge funds, and financial institutions exploring or already investing in this sector. 
The move by the Bank of Montreal is therefore significant not only for the bank itself, but also for the broader financial landscape, signaling a possible trend towards a wider adoption of cryptocurrencies by major financial players.
The regulatory discussions of the issue 
The announcement has also sparked discussions on regulatory frameworks and the future of investments in cryptocurrencies.
In Canada, regulatory bodies have adopted a relatively progressive approach towards cryptocurrencies, facilitating a supportive environment for innovations such as the Bitcoin spot ETF.
This regulatory framework is crucial, as it provides a level of security and trust for institutions and their clients, promoting a more inclusive approach to integrating cryptocurrencies into traditional financial portfolios.
Furthermore, the disclosure of holdings in a Bitcoin spot ETF by the Bank of Montreal could encourage other institutions to follow suit. 
As more banks and financial institutions begin to incorporate cryptocurrencies into their offerings, we may see an increase in the development of similar products, further improving liquidity and stability in the cryptocurrency markets. 
This, in turn, could lead to more robust investment strategies, diversified portfolios, and a wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies in various sectors of the economy.
Investors’ reactions to Bank of Montreal’s move have been largely positive, with many seeing it as a prudent step towards diversification and innovation in banking services. 
While some remain skeptical about the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, the controlled and regulated environment of an ETF provides a more familiar and secure framework for traditional investors to explore this new asset class.
Conclusions 
In conclusion, the decision of the Bank of Montreal to disclose its holdings in a Bitcoin spot ETF represents a significant development in the cryptocurrency landscape in Canada. 
It demonstrates not only the adaptive strategies of the bank in the face of evolving financial technologies, but also signals a broader shift in the acceptance and integration of digital assets in the traditional financial sector. 
As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the role of traditional banks like the Bank of Montreal will be crucial in shaping the future of investments in digital assets, potentially leading to greater stability and wider adoption of cryptocurrencies in general.

OKX Crypto Exchange Unveils Plans for Expansion In Austra...


                                OKX Stepping Towards Launch Of Local Regulated Entity In Australia                                What’s the NewsOKX, a Crypto exchange is moving to Australia to expand its business through the Asia-Pacific region and focus on services under a locally regulated entity. This OKX Australian expansion comes after the company announced its intention regarding growth. Finally, after a while, the company has decided to expand its firm in Australia.On 14 May 2024, the main sponsor of OKX, Oscar Piastri of McLaren Racing officially announced the news in the media in Sydney.  Jamie Kennedy, an OKX Australia general manager has delivered a statement regarding the platform. He pointed out a secure, easy-to-use, and responsive platform that includes limitless access to banking facilities along with AUD pairs with popular cryptocurrencies for the crypto users. OKX also dropped the number of trading pairs for the Australian crypto users which is 170 trading pairs.

Some are already familiar with the cryptocurrency while others are newly entered the market and unknown to the subjects. Hence, there are varieties in Australia to offer customers diversified services.Last year's Discussion regarding the expansionOKX desires to open the office in March 2023 because they believe that a lot of people in Australia are interestingly fascinated about crypto and hence they saw growth prospective in the Australian market. Since March 20,  the cryptocurrency exchange OKX turned its attention to Australia.

The support for the unsupported tokens was only removed on March 20. With a daily volume of $2.8 billion, OKX is still the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world by volume, behind Bybit.ConclusionCoin Gabbar extracted from the expansion of OKX in Australia that it will initiate a new chapter in its cryptocurrency journey with its commitment to complying with the regulator's norms and customer satisfaction.

Coinbase Reports Widespread Outage, Confirms Ongoing Investigation


							

Coinbase is experiencing a widespread system outage.



The Coinbase team is investigating the issue and working on a solution.



The crypto exchange assured users that their funds were safe.




Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., is experiencing a widespread system outage. A post from Coinbase Support on X in the early hours of Tuesday stated that the crypto exchange is investigating the issue and working on a solution. The team further assured users that their funds were safe while they worked to resolve the problem. 







The outage interrupted trading activities on both the Coinbase website and app. As of the time of writing, attempting to access the crypto exchange’s website returned a 503 error message, showing the problem persisted. 



Meanwhile, Coinbase users have expressed frustration over the issue, with some taking to the social media platform X to communicate their inability to carry out operations. A user responding to Coinbase’s post shared a screenshot of a message he received trying to access the Coinbase app. The message on the shared screenshot read – “Planned maintenance in progress.”









Apart from the initial message from the Coinbase Support team, the crypto exchange had yet to state the reason for the outage as of the time of filing this report. The crypto exchange’s position remained the same as its original message of investigating the situation.



Coinbase experienced a similar outage in March this year. However, the firm later found the reason behind the March incident was heavy trading activities on the platform.

El Salvador news: the strategy of buying "one bitcoin a day"

Among the latest news on El Salvador, the new reality visible to the world stands out: the website where you can track the Country’s Bitcoin Treasury. In fact, by doing so, the strategy implemented by the President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, to “buy a bitcoin a day” is now in front of everyone’s eyes. 

El Salvador news: Nayib Bukele’s strategy of “buying one bitcoin a day” is visible to everyone
Yesterday, the new online platform of El Salvador was announced, providing public access to data on the country’s BTC investments through a custom mempool.
Basically, through the website, anyone can track the Bitcoin Treasury of El Salvador.
On this subject, it is possible to verify the famous strategy implemented by President Nayib Bukele already in November 2022: “buying one bitcoin a day until BTC becomes inaccessible with fiat currencies”.
And so, while yesterday the total capital owned by El Salvador was 5,748.76 BTC, today, the total on the website is instead 5,749.76 BTC. The daily Bitcoin was therefore purchased by the country and verified on its portal.
Nayib Bukele also shared the news on his X profile, currently followed by 6.1 million followers

“El Salvador bought another #Bitcoin today. President Bukele said they will buy 1 #BTC every day ‘until Bitcoin becomes inaccessible with fiat currencies’.”
El Salvador news: the first Bitcoin-based capital raise airing on Bitfinex
Another novelty for the country that made Bitcoin legal tender in 2014, shared by Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether and CTO of Bitfinex. 

“The next phase of El Salvador’s Bitcoin economy development is coming tomorrow. Disintermediating traditional finance and making capital and investments available to everyone. Watch @bfxsecurities”
Tomorrow marks the beginning of a new era in capital markets based on bitcoin. El Salvador’s first capital raise on @Liquid_BTC will be broadcast on @BFXSecurities
Basically, on Bitfinex Securities, a government company of the iFinex group, the first capital raise of El Salvador will soon be available, with the issuance of new tokens powered by Liquid Network, the Bitcoin sidechain. 
The project refers to the new debt tokens in “Volcano Bond” style, which will be used to raise the capital needed to build a large hotel complex near the international airport of the South American country.
The structure is called Hampton by Hilton and covers 4,484 square meters on five levels. The new debt token is called HILSV, and aims to raise 6.25 million dollars with a 10% premium and a duration of 5 years with a minimum investment of $1000. 
The construction of the hotel financed with HILSV will seek to ensure a significant flow of tourists to El Salvador, as well as the creation of about 6000 jobs. At the same time, the formula behind HILSV will allow small investors to be part of this investment, breaking down barriers to microcredit. 
The price of BTC
Meanwhile, the price of BTC continues to fluctuate around $62,000. In the last week, in fact, BTC has reached price lows of $60,300 and highs of $64,200. 
In the last 24 hours, the trading volume of the queen of crypto has increased by 60%. 
While its market cap remains at $1.220 billion, slightly higher than a week ago.

Ripple Chief Executive Defends Statement on Tether


							

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino called Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse an “uninformed CEO.”



Ripple’s CEO recently said that the US authorities are coming after USDT.



Garlinghouse noted that he wasn’t attacking Tether.




Tether chief executive Paolo Ardoino recently took to social media platform X to highlight the statement on USDT given by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in an interview, calling him an “uninformed CEO.”



As reported earlier, Garlinghouse said in an interview that the US authorities are targeting USDT and seeking to crackdown on the stablecoin, while adding that he cannot predict the impact that this would have on the digital asset sector. 









Ardoino stated in a post on X that Garlinghouse is “spreading fear” about USDT and emphasizing that his firm seeks to roll out a competitive stablecoin. He also noted that USDT has “proved overtime to have strong price stability, highly liquid reserves, top tier custodians and profound compliance.”



Garlinghouse replied to the post by Ardoino, clarifying his statement, stating that Tether is indeed a very important part of the digital asset ecosystem, and noting:




“I wasn’t attacking Tether…the next words out of my mouth during the podcast were that I view Tether as a hugely important part of the ecosystem”




The Ripple executive claimed that his “point was that the US govt has clearly indicated they want more control over USD-backed stablecoin issuers, and thus, Tether, as the largest player, is in their line of sight.”



On the other hand, Tether has been planning expansion beyond the stablecoin business, recently announcing four new divisions.

Official: the Swiss bank UBS has bought Bitcoin ETFs

Yesterday, the Swiss bank UBS presented an updated form 13F-HR to the US SEC. 
Inside the document all the assets owned by UBS Group AG at the end of the first quarter of the year (March 31, 2024) are listed, and among these is also the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). 
IBIT is the BlackRock’s ETF on Bitcoin spot, and iShares is the subsidiary of BlackRock that issues and manages the ETFs. 

Swiss bank UBS and the purchase of Bitcoin spot ETF
UBS is the largest Swiss banking institution and the largest private bank in the world. 
The UBS brand was born in 1912 as “Union Bank of Switzerland”, but the two banks that merged to create UBS already existed in 1862-1863. 
It is therefore a decidedly old banking group, although not extremely ancient. 
In 1997 UBS merged with SBS (Swiss Bank Corporation), and since at the time they were respectively the second and third largest banks in Switzerland, they gave rise to the largest banking group in Switzerland, UBS AG. Since then, UBS no longer stands for Union Bank of Switzerland. 
With that merger, the “New UBS” became the second largest combined bank in the world, behind only the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. 
In the early 2000s, the process of internationalization began, leading UBS to become a global banking group, no longer just Swiss. The headquarters are still in Zurich, but now it operates worldwide. 
Last year UBS agreed to acquire Credit Suisse, one of its main competitors, due to the risk of the latter’s bankruptcy. 
Overall, the UBS group has more than 115,000 employees worldwide, and manages a total wealth of over $5.7 trillion. 
It is a publicly traded company without a single majority shareholder, and among the largest shareholders are GIC Private Limited with 7.07%, BlackRock Inc with 4.98%, Norges Bank with 3.30%, MFS Investment Management with 3.05%, and Capital Group Companies with 3.01% of the total share capital. 
The purchase of Bitcoin ETF shares by the Swiss bank UBS
In light of this, it is not surprising that UBS has chosen BlackRock’s ETF to take a position on the price of Bitcoin. 
Note that he declares that as of March 31st he owned 3,600 shares of IBIT, with a total value of only $146,000, purchased at around $40.5 per share. 
As of today, the price of IBIT shares has dropped to $36, so the purchase was made by UBS when the price of Bitcoin was above $68,000. 
His 3,600 IBIT shares are currently worth less than $130,000, so for now UBS is at a loss of almost $16,000 with this investment. 
However, it cannot be ruled out that since March 31st the Swiss bank may have decided to make other similar purchases, also because the $146,000 invested correspond to less than 0.001% of the total value of the assets it has declared to own in the 13F-HR form submitted to the SEC. 
BlackRock’s ETF
The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) currently owns just under 275,000 BTC, more than those owned by MicroStrategy, but less than those still owned by the Grayscale ETF. 
Altogether, it has issued 482 million shares, whose price during the first months of the year has risen from the initial $30 to a maximum of almost $42 in mid-March. 
So UBS bought them when they were near their highs, even though the purchase was extremely small for a Swiss bank. 
Subsequently the price has dropped, and now since the end of April it has been moving sideways within a range between $33 and $36. 
UBS Stocks
UBS Group AG is listed on the stock exchange in New York. 
Yesterday, upon the news of his investment in Bitcoin, the price did not move significantly, also because the exposure to IBIT is really minimal. 
The closing price of yesterday’s session, $29.7, is practically the same as Friday’s closing price. 
During 2024, the price of UBS shares first rose to $32, then in April it dropped to $26 on May 1st, and then it recovered. 
It should be remembered that during 2023 it had risen significantly, even after the acquisition of the almost failed Credit Suisse. 
Indeed, after starting the year at $19, it closed at almost $31, with an increase of 63%. 
Actually, the maximum price of UBS stocks on the stock market since the 2008 crisis was reached earlier this year in mid-March, when they exceeded $32 for the first time in almost twenty years. 
Instead, the all-time high remains at $66 in April 2007, before the subprime mortgage crisis broke out. 
UBS and Bitcoin
It is worth noting that at the end of January, UBS published on its official website an article explicitly discussing the new ETFs on Bitcoin spot. 
So his interest in these products started a few weeks before the moment they decided to purchase them. 
In that article, written by the UBS editorial team, they stated that the Bitcoin spot ETFs had “finally” arrived, already indicating a clear interest in them. 
After all, for financial institutions of this importance it could be counterproductive to buy BTC on crypto exchanges, because then they would be forced to make it public. The risk is that they end up damaging their image. 
Instead, buying shares of an ETF issued by BlackRock does not risk compromising the image of such a financial institution at all, especially if the exposure is extremely limited. 
At this point, given that the market reaction has not seemed negative at all, it is possible that they decide to continue down this path and maybe buy more IBIT shares, especially now that their price has dropped.

                        The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is warning against “money mule” scams targeting remote job seekers.On Monday, the regulator said people seeking work-from-home opportunities should be on the lookout for these deceptive schemes.According to Melanie Devoe, director at the Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO), summer job seekers, drawn to part-time online work, could be especially vulnerable to scams. However, they end up risking jail time as unwitting money mules for criminals, she said.Work-From-Home Scam Turns into Money Laundering Nightmare
Criminal organizations are actively recruiting networks of people to launder money, according to the CFTC. They move illegal funds between bank accounts, converting currencies, and using blockchains to avoid law enforcement detection.The criminals often target unsuspecting people who might not realize they’re involved in a crime. These victims may believe they’re helping a friend, a romantic interest, or simply fulfilling work duties. However, both willing and unwitting participants face the same consequences, which can include criminal charges.The CFTC cracked down on money mule activity in two recent cases. In one instance, the CFTC accused Debiex of using well-known romance scam tactics to steal $2.3m in customer funds meant for digital asset trading.Another enforcement action involved a California man and his company. They were charged with running a complex romance scam, also known as a “pig butchering scheme” that defrauded dozens of investors for over $1m.Protect Yourself from Crypto Money Laundering with These Red Flags
The CFTC warned potential victims to be wary of two main red flags: “off-ramping” and “on-ramping” crypto-assets. With off-ramping, criminals might send you crypto and ask you to convert it to dollars, moving the cash through your bank account to another, essentially laundering their money.On the other hand, on-ramping could involve criminals giving you cash to buy crypto (like at a bitcoin kiosk) and then forwarding it to another walle, again, using you to get their money into the crypto system. A third tactic, “smurfing,” involves receiving a large amount of crypto yourself, which could raise suspicion.

Twitter: Roaring Kitty wakes up GameStop (GME) stocks

Roaring Kitty, the man who led the ‘meme stock mania’ of 2021, is back after 3 years with a post on X (formerly Twitter). On the same day, GameStop’s shares increased by over 74.4%, shaking the market. 

Roaring Kitty: his return on Twitter after 3 years makes GameStop shares soar by +70%
Back on everyone’s lips, it’s the great return of Roaring Kitty, the man of the ‘meme stock mania of 2021’, who with a new post on X (formerly Twitter), has once again shaken the market. 
First of all, GameStop’s shares recorded an increase of +74.4% after a surge of 110%. 
His first post is an image on X of a video gamer leaning forward on the chair, as if to indicate that he is taking the game seriously. The tweet marked Roaring Kitty’s first post on the platform, but also on Reddit, since 2021. The post has gathered 63,000 likes in 13 hours.

Below I tweet, they are all preview videos of some popular movies, up to the most recent one, where Roaring Kitty blatantly asked the audience if they got his attention. 

Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, is a former marketer at Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. Also known as DeepF——Value on Reddit, Gill has attracted an army of day traders who have encouraged each other and invested in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer’s stock and call options of GameStop between 2020 and 2021.
Roaring Kitty: the return on Twitter of the man behind the meme stock mania of 2021 and GameStop’s actions
The new post by Roaring Kitty claims his return, shaking up the market and investors. 
Not only that, on X there are several videos that even recall Gill’s testimony in 2021, in the face of a class action lawsuit against him. Here, in the video below, Roaring Kitty pretended to be a novice trader despite being a licensed professional.

“GameStop’s shares explode as ‘Roaring Kitty’ returns on X in his first post since June 18, 2021. Short sellers have suffered a mark-to-market loss of ~1 billion dollars, while today GME is up over 70%. (CNBC). ‘Roaring Kitty’ went viral in 2021 for sparking the ‘meme stock frenzy’ by waging war against institutional investors betting against GameStop. Last night he posted a photo on X with a man leaning forward in his gaming chair, bringing attention back to the meme stock. The video below shows Roaring Kitty’s testimony on GameStop in 2021.”
Not only that, also a Robinhood user had filed a class action lawsuit in 2021 against Roaring Kitty, after the decision of the application to limit GameStop trading on its platform. 
According to the market research platform Quiver Quantitative, on Monday GameStop was the most discussed stock on WallStreetBets on Reddit, with over 600 mentions in the last 24 hours, surpassing the popular chipmaker Nvidia.
Are meme stocks back? The case described by Georgetown University
The case of GameStop and its stocks that, in 2021 had turned finance into a meme, had become a case study at Georgetown University.
Specifically, GameStop had shocked the world of stock markets, as a company in deep crisis, unable to react to technological innovation, saw its investors turn it into a “meme stock”. 
Basically, on one side some hedge funds were ready to short sell GME stocks, a group of retail investors who had noticed this intention, found themselves on a Reddit forum, WallStreetBets, discussing and making mass decisions. 
And indeed, it was precisely in mass that retail investors bought GameStop shares, triggering the short squeeze. Consequently, the price grew disproportionately and hedge funds accumulated losses of billions of dollars in just a few hours, as they were selling shares that were increasing in value. 
Georgetown University has defined this game on GameStop’s actions as a “gigantic joke”, a meme that makes the web laugh, a behavior imitated by big investors. 
The problem is that big investors were the ones ending up under the meme stock’s attack.

Bitcoin exits post-halving dip, signals accumulation phase, suggests analyst - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin (BTC) may have exited the post-halving “danger zone” and entered the accumulation phase, according to data shared by technical analyst Rekt Capital. He suggests that the selling pressure behind Bitcoin’s price is weakening.Following the halving event, Bitcoin typically experiences a “danger zone” characterized by heightened volatility. In the 2016 cycle, Bitcoin’s value dropped nearly 18% in the three weeks that followed.This specific downturn came back in this halving cycle, albeit with a mild 6.5% decline over the same period. However, this was briefly followed by a 15% surge, suggesting a strong exit from the “danger zone”.At the time of reporting, Bitcoin is trading at nearly $62,600, marking a 3% increase in the last 24 hours. Rekt Capital notes that the $60,000 support level is crucial for the continuation of this upward trend, potentially leading to a return to the $68,000 mark.“History suggests it means that Bitcoin will no longer produce downside volatility below its current Re-Accumulation Range,” Rekt Capital explained in his recent blog post. “The Bitcoin correction should be over and price should be able to maintain itself above $60,000 going forward.”While historical trends do not guarantee future results, the current support level’s resilience is a positive sign for Bitcoin’s trajectory.What to expect next?A major focus this week will be the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), which will be released on Wednesday. Forecasts for the CPI and core CPI are 3.4% and 3.6%, respectively.The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) target is 2% and current data shows inflation remains stubborn. Rates might stay high for a longer period unless inflation improves.According to BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes, rising government debt and adjustments by the Fed and US Treasury are making alternative investments like Bitcoin more appealing. He predicts that Bitcoin’s price will exceed $60,000 and move to a period of relative stability between $60,000 and $70,000 by August.The upcoming US presidential election could also influence Bitcoin’s value, according to Standard Chartered. The bank believes a potential win for Donald Trump could benefit Bitcoin’s value. Additionally, the US’s fiscal and monetary policy shift is seen as potentially favorable for Bitcoin.Standard Chartered expects BTC’s price to reach $150,000 by year’s end and $200,000 by 2025.

Toncoin Outshines Bitcoin With Price Surge And Social Buzz


																The native token of the Telegram-connected Open Network, Toncoin (TON), has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) despite the recent market turbulence. Bitcoin fell by 3% over the last week, while TON increased by nearly 20%. Within the cryptocurrency world, this unexpected outperformance has set off a wild speculating frenzy. Will TON’s rapid ascent continue, or is this merely a passing blip?

	Related Reading



Social Buzz Fuels The Toncoin Engine
One key factor behind TON’s recent success appears to be a surge in social media activity. Social volume, a metric that tracks discussions and mentions on platforms like Twitter and Telegram, has skyrocketed by over 20% compared to the previous week. This suggests a growing interest in TON, potentially attracting new investors and driving up the price.

Investor Sentiment: A Mixed Bag For TON
However, a closer look reveals a potential wrinkle in this optimistic outlook. While the overall sentiment surrounding TON has been positive, it has recently dipped into negative territory. This could be a sign of growing investor apprehension, as some may be worried about the sustainability of the current price rally.
Bitcoin is now trading at $62.009. Chart: TradingView
Accumulation Signals: Are Investors Betting Big On Toncoin?
On the other hand, some metrics point towards potential long-term bullishness. The mean dollar invested age, an indicator of how long tokens have been held, has been gradually increasing. This suggests that investors are holding onto their TON, potentially with an eye on future gains.
Additionally, the dormant circulation, representing tokens that haven’t been moved in a while, has remained low. While a previous spike coincided with a price peak, the current stability could indicate a more strategic accumulation by investors.

Technical Analysis: Eyes On The Prize For Toncoin
Technical analysts, who study price charts and historical data to predict future movements, are also cautiously optimistic about TON. Fibonacci retracement levels, a popular technical tool, suggest the recent downtrend may be nearing its end. This could pave the way for TON to climb towards targets near $10, with potential profit-taking opportunities for investors.

A Marathon, Not A Sprint
While the recent surge in price and social media buzz paints a promising picture for TON, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile.
The current uptrend for TON could be the beginning of a long-term ascent, fueled by growing adoption and a thriving ecosystem within the Telegram network. However, it’s also possible that this is just a short-lived rally, followed by a correction.

How GameStop helped Dogecoin, WIF rise 10% as memecoins surge 170% - AMBCrypto



The value of the meme coin market has skyrocketed in the past 24 hours. 
DOGE and WIF have logged double-digit price rallies during that period. 

The meme market has witnessed significant growth in trading activity in the past 24 hours after GameStop stock trader Keith Gill posted on his Roaring Kitty X account for the first time since 2021. 


The image of a man holding a controller and sitting focused on a chair caused GameStop’s stock to surge by more than 100% in the 24 hours that followed. 
By noon on the 13th of May, trading of the stock had been halted several times to curb market volatility. 
The rally in GameStop’s stock led to increased activity in the meme coin market. 
According to CoinMarketCap’s data, in the last 24 hours, trading volume in that market totaled $8 billion, having grown by over 170%. 
The sector’s market capitalization also increased by 10% during the same period. 
DOGE and WIF head in different directions
In the last 24 hours, the values of leading meme assets Dogecoin [DOGE] and dogwifhat [WIF] have grown by double digits. While DOGE has seen a 10% price rally, WIF’s value has climbed by 11%.
As of this writing, DOGE traded at $0.15. Its double-digit rally in the past 24 hours caused its price to bounce off support at $0.14 as the bulls attempt to reclaim the resistance price level of $0.16. 
However, for this to happen, demand for the meme coin has to be sustained. 
Readings from the coin’s key momentum indicators observed on a one-day chart showed that DOGE’s market was yet to be flush with demand.
At press time, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 49.84, below the 50-neutral spot. Likewise, its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures the flow of money into and out of the asset, was at its zero line. 
The values of these indicators showed that despite the price hike in the past 24 hours, market participants’ demand for DOGE had yet to exceed its distribution.

On the other hand, WIF fared considerably better. As of this writing, its key momentum indicators rested above their respective center lines. 
Its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 66.61, while its RSI was in an uptrend at 52.68. These values signaled that the meme coin’s accumulation was beginning to gain momentum. 
Further, WIF’s 11% gains in the past 24 hours have pushed its price above the 20-day simple moving average (SMA).

When an asset’s price rallies above this moving average, it signals the beginning of a bullish trend in the short to medium term.
 It often means that buyers have regained control, and the asset’s price is trending upwards.

This DeFi Platform Announced Season 1 of Airdrop Campaign


The decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Okto has announced the launch of Season 1 of its Okto Wallet points program, along with a strategic airdrop of its native OKTO tokens. 
This initiative promises to reward users for their on-chain activities.
Okto Airdrops 7% of Its Tokens to Users
In an exclusive interview with BeInCrypto, Neeraj Khandelwal, the co-founder of Okto, said that all existing self-custody wallets equipped with the Okto Wallet application have received bonus Okto points. The company has set an initial drop of 20 million points for all the eligible on-chain traders.
This points program extends to all on-chain activities on the Okto Wallet app. Activities include depositing crypto, buying and selling tokens, placing futures trades, and participating in various airdrop quests. 
This initiative incentivizes users to engage more deeply with the platform’s offerings.

Users transferring their assets from other centralized exchanges to Okto Wallet can earn bonus points. The platform has planned a reward of 1.5x bonus points for high-volume traders on their first $1 million in futures volume.

Through the points program, the airdrop campaign allocates 7% of the OKTO tokens to early users. According to the whitepaper, the OKTO token would power the OKTO chain and play a crucial role in network operations. However, the team has not yet released the total supply and complete allocation details.


“Details about total supply and allocation of the remaining 93% will be detailed in next version of our whitepaper,” Khandelwal told BeInCrypto.

Recently, the crypto community has scrutinized the fairness of token distributions. EigenLayer airdrop faced backlash for its changing eligibility criteria and regional restrictions. Large allocation to the project’s investors was also a concern. 
In response to such concerns, Khandelwal reassured that Okto is committed to ensuring a level playing field. Furthermore, the platform says that it has implemented strong sybil checks and partnered with leading anti-sybil establishments to prevent fraudulent activities.
In addition, Okto is also advancing its technological infrastructure by developing a fully expressive orchestration layer.

“The Okto infra does the heavy lifting of abstracting Web3 complexities and orchestrating end-to-end delegated and secure transactions,” Khandelwal explained.

These Meme Coins Explode Daily as Bitcoin Faces Enhanced Volatility (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price soared by over two grand yesterday but was pushed back down today amid system issues coming from the largest US crypto exchange, Coinbase.
At the same time, several altcoins have taken the main stage with impressive gains, but none more notable than Pepe.
BTC’s Pump and Dump
It was just over a week ago – last Monday – when bitcoin jumped to a multi-week peak of $65,500 but the bears quickly intercepted the move and drove it south. The correction culminated on Friday with a price drop that pushed BTC all the way down to $60,200.
As most were preparing for another leg down that can see the cryptocurrency losing the coveted $60,000 level, the asset actually reversed its trajectory and reclaimed some value during the weekend to around $61,000.
This Monday began on a more positive note as BTC jumped from $60,800 to $63,500 in just a few hours. However, it failed to maintain its run and retraced to just under $63,000.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


The landscape worsened earlier this morning when Coinbase reported some issues with its network. Bitcoin reacted with an immediate price drop that drove it to $61,400.
Despite recovering some ground since then, BTC is still below $62,000. Its market cap has declined to $1.220 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 51.1%.

PEPE Leads the Way
Meme coins have become the main talking point once again in the cryptocurrency industry, with numerous impressive price pumps over the past day. PEPE is the leader of the larger-cap meme tokens, having gained over 20% in the past day. Moreover, the asset charted a new all-time high earlier today.
Floki (10%), Dogecoin (4%), and WIF (3%) follow suit from this cohort of crypto assets. In contrast, most other alts are in the red, with ETF solidifying its place below $3,000 after a 2% drop and BNB down beneath $590.
The total crypto market cap has slumped beneath $2.4 trillion after losing $40 billion in a day.

Will GameStop Pump Trigger Crypto Market Rally Similar to 2021? Is Meme Coin Mania Back? | Coinspeaker



The GameStop rally triggered a massive surge in the meme coin market with DOGE and SHIB gaining 10%, and other meme coins jumping by 34%.

Three years after GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) stock stormed Wall Street, the stock is back in action once again. On Monday, May 13, GameStop stock rallied by a staggering 75% in a single day closing the day at $30.45. Interestingly, the GME stock has rallied by an additional 21% in the aftermarket hours trading.
This surge on Wall Street led to an even stronger rally in the Solana-based meme coin GameStop ($GME). In the last 36 hours, the GameStop meme coin price has surged by a staggering 1800%, leading to a strong rally across the meme coin sector.




These developments have led everyone to think about whether we are going to see a GameStop 2.0 rally soon. Keith Gill, often lauded as the catalyst behind the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, vanished from social media on June 19, 2021.
However, after an almost three-year absence, he resurfaced on May 13, sharing a cryptic meme featuring a gamer sitting up in their chair to signify his return. Within 24 hours of Gill’s reappearance on X, GameStop shares surged by up to 111%. Roaring Kitty ($ROAR), the cryptocurrency devised after Keith Gill, also saw a 4,100% rally in the last 24 hours.
This massive rally in the GameStop stock on Monday led to over $1 billion in losses for short sellers, as per data from S3 Partners. They further noted that the 74% rally in the GME stock led to a mark-to-market loss of $838 million for the short-selling hedge funds. Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3 managing director of predictive analytics, told CNBC:

“Expect short covering in this stock as it already had a 100/100 squeeze score prior to today’s trading.”

Meme Coin Party KickStarts
Several market analysts believe that GameStop short squeeze served as a catalyst for a massive surge across the entire meme coin sector. The top two meme coins – Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) – rallied by 10% in the last 24 hours. Other meme coins have delivered even higher gains.
The GameStop surge by 74% on Monday spurred a significant uptick in meme coin activity, attracting attention from crypto traders. Memecoins experienced a notable start to the week, witnessing breakouts and decouplings across the board over the past 24 hours.
Trading volumes for the top 50 assets in this category surged by more than 34%. Coins such as $PEPE, $MAGA, $MOG, $BITCOIN, $PONKE, $PEPE2.0, $SPX, and $ANALOS are worth monitoring for potential volatility opportunities, reports Santiment.
However, some market analysts note that we’re still not near the 2021-like frenzy in GameStop. eToro market analyst Josh Gilbert said that the current outstanding shorts in GameStop are much smaller in comparison to that seen during 2021. Thus, the move to the upside would also be smaller.
“The environment is just not comparable to 2021, when interest rates were at rock bottom, governments were providing fiscal stimulus globally, and major economies had little to no inflation,” he said.

According to Analysis Firm Kaiko, Bitcoin Miners Are in a Difficult Situation After the Halving! Here's Why - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to information provided by researcher Kaiko, Bitcoin miners are facing increasing pressure as they struggle with low token rewards, which has significant impacts on market liquidity and trading activity.
A significant portion of Bitcoin mining revenue has been experiencing a significant decline recently following the halving at the end of April.


This event, known as the halving, occurs approximately every four years and reduces mining rewards by half.
The latest halving, the fourth since 2012, reduced daily production from 900 tokens to 450, resulting in a loss of annual revenue of approximately $10 billion based on then-current prices.





In response to this revenue decline, Bitcoin miners have attempted to offset their losses by taking advantage of transaction fees, an alternative revenue stream beyond the mining subsidy.
However, due in part to the introduction of memecoins on the Bitcoin network, the post-halving surge in transaction fees has since subsided, contributing to further revenue problems for miners.


Kaiko's analysis suggests that potential selling pressure from miners, especially those with significant Bitcoin reserves, could have a negative impact on cryptocurrency markets.

This scenario is further complicated by the seasonal slowdown in trading activity and liquidity, which is usually observed during the summer months.





Despite the recent revenue decline, Bitcoin miners have tended to hold on to their reserves, unlike the sell-offs observed during the 2022 crypto market downturn.
Over the past two years, major Bitcoin mining companies such as Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain have increased their holdings, demonstrating renewed confidence in the digital asset market.
According to Kaiko's data, Marathon reportedly owns 17,631 Bitcoins worth over $1.1 billion, while Riot owns 8,872 Bitcoins worth over $500 million.

Solana's Recovery: The Role of Institutions in Reviving SOL


The Solana (SOL) price is awaiting solid bullish cues to break out of the consolidation it is currently in.
This might come with the support of the institutional investors whose interest is reigniting.
Solana Sees Large Inflows
While 2023 was a good year for Solana’s price, it was also a good year for the asset in terms of investment, particularly from large wallet investors who made SOL their favorite asset. However, since the beginning of the year, this changed.
SOL noted fewer inflows than other altcoins such as Litecoin, Polkadot, and XRP. This is now changing, as Solana’s institutional inflows have risen considerably in the past two weeks.

For the week ending May 10, SOL emerged as the altcoin with the highest inflows, amounting to nearly $6 million. This bumped the net flows year to date, bringing it up from $11.1 million to $17 million.
Solana Institutional Inflows. Source: CoinShares
Although other assets have noted much larger year-to-date flows, Solana’s price could likely catch up if this interest does not fade.
At the same time, a shift from bearish to bullish is close to being confirmed as well, looking at the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI measures the speed and change of price movements. It’s used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. 
Read More: How to Buy Solana (SOL) and Everything You Need To Know

Solana RSI. Source: TradingView
The presence of the indicator above the neutral line at 50.0 can be observed, and testing this level as support would confirm the bullishness. This would aid SOL in observing and continuing any recovery that initiates in the coming days.
SOL Price Prediction: Key Level to Watch

Solana’s price, trading at $147, has been between $126 and $156 for nearly a month now. Three attempts at breaching the upper limit have failed, but with the help of institutions, the fourth attempt could succeed. 
This would enable SOL to cross $160 and head towards $169, which is a key support level based on historical price action.
Read More: Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030

However, another failed breach could lead to a drawdown with Solana’s price testing the local support at $137. Falling through this would result in a dip to $126, invalidating the bullish thesis.

GameStop Surges 110% as 'Roaring Kitty' Returns: What's Next?


							

Keith Gill’s return to social media coincides with GameStop’s over 110% stock surge, signaling renewed market interest.



GameStop’s rapid climb, propelled by Gill’s return, signifies a resurgence in meme stock trading driven by online communities.



The stock’s rise triggers a 5% increase in Crypto Memecoins, suggesting a connection between meme stocks and cryptocurrency markets.




Wu Blockchain, a cryptocurrency and blockchain news source, reported a resurgence in GameStop stock alongside the return of Keith Gill, famously known as “Roaring Kitty,” after a three-year social media hiatus. Gill’s online presence coincided with GameStop’s stock soaring over 110%, triggering multiple circuit breakers. This surge also influenced a 5% increase in the broader Crypto Memecoin sector.







GameStop, a video game retailer, experienced a rapid rise in its shares, climbing over 70% in Monday’s morning trade to surpass $30, marking its highest level since 2022. This surge follows Gill’s reappearance, known for his role in the January 2021 rally that defied Wall Street predictions. Despite a slight price retreat, the stock’s recent performance reflects renewed investor interest.



Following his social media disappearance, Gill returned on Sunday with a cryptic post featuring a drawing of a man seemingly preparing for action. Subsequent posts on Monday further hinted at his re-engagement in the market.







The rise and fall of GameStop shares earlier this year were emblematic of meme stock trading, a trend driven by independent online traders sharing investment tips. Gill, among the most prominent figures in this movement, denied allegations of manipulating investors, attributing his social media activity to personal enjoyment. 









The meme stock phenomenon is part of a larger pattern of growing retail investor trading. Analysts believe that the first spike in meme stocks during the epidemic was caused by greater savings and free time. This year, when markets improved, retail investor activity surged on trading platforms such as Charles Schwab and Robinhood.



As of the latest update, the GameStop price surged to $0.012947 with a 24-hour trading volume of $167,602,349, representing a 429.35% increase in the past 24 hours. GameStop’s market cap stands at $89,140,304, with a circulating supply of 6,885,214,218 GME coins.

$BTC: 10x Research CEO Predicts a Volatile Week for Bitcoin Ahead Amid U.S. Inflation Data Releases | Cryptoglobe


                                
Markus Thielen is a prominent figure in the digital asset investment community, known for his analytical and strategic expertise. He is currently the CEO of 10x Research, a firm that provides detailed research and insights into digital assets, aimed primarily at institutional investors. Additionally, Thielen serves as the Head of Research and Strategy at Matrixport, a leading firm in the digital asset investment space.



Earlier today, Thielen shared his insights on LinkedIn regarding the implications of this week’s inflation data for Bitcoin. Thielen began by highlighting traders’ expectations for a significant move in Bitcoin’s price by the end of the week. According to Thielen, this anticipated volatility is influenced by the upcoming release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) data tonight and the more crucial Consumer Price Index (CPI) data tomorrow. These metrics are key indicators of inflation, with the PPI measuring the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output and the CPI tracking the average change in prices paid by consumers for goods and services.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Thielen pointed out that traders are expecting a +/-6% move for Bitcoin, driven by these inflation reports. However, he noted that the implied volatility, currently priced at 52.8% compared to 50.8% for other maturities, does not suggest that the market is fully anticipating a major move. Implied volatility, a metric derived from the price of an asset’s options, indicates the market’s expectations for future volatility. Despite the slightly higher implied volatility, Thielen observed that it is not considered expensive since the realized volatility, which measures the actual historical volatility of Bitcoin, traded slightly below 50%.



In his analysis, Thielen emphasized that Bitcoin is currently testing the support level between $60,800 and $61,400. A support level is a price point where an asset tends to find buying interest, preventing it from falling further. Thielen warned that if Bitcoin breaks below this support range, it could lead to lower prices. He highlighted that the average entry price for spot Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) holdings is around $57,000, suggesting that a drop below $60,000 would likely cause significant concern among these investors. The spot Bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without owning the actual asset, and its inflows have reportedly slowed since Bitcoin’s recent rally attempts failed.



At the time of writing (8:30 a.m. UTC on May 14), Bitcoin is trading at around $61,857, down 1.5% in the past 24-hour period.

Machine learning algorithm predicts SHIB price on May 31, 2024


Although many assets in the cryptocurrency market have turned red, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is moving in the opposite direction, recording significant gains on its daily chart, and machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms predict further (albeit modest) price increases in the following weeks.
Indeed, Shiba Inu has made a surprising twist that has seen it advance over 7% in a matter of hours without any significant announcement or development during the weekend, other than the popular token becoming one of the payment methods on CoinGate last week.
SHIB price prediction
As it happens, Shiba Inu might continue to advance during May, possibly hitting the price of $0.000024 by May 31, 2024, according to the latest forecast by the advanced machine learning algorithm over at the crypto analytics platform PricePredictions obtained on May 14.

In other words, provided that the algorithm, which uses technical analysis (TA) indicators like average true range (ATR), relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), and others, is correct, the price of SHIB would increase 1.61% by the end of this month.

Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is trading at the price of $0.00002362, which indicates a 7.18% gain in the last 24 hours, an increase of 0.11% across the previous seven days, as well as an advance of 4.18% in the last month, in addition to growing 130.04% since the year’s turn.

It is also worth noting that the sentiment on SHIB’s 1-month technical gauges is bullish and suggests a ‘buy,’ as recorded by oscillators in the ‘buy’ zone at 2 and moving averages (MA) pointing at a ‘strong buy’ at 7, as per the most recent TradingView information.

At the same time, renowned crypto trading expert Ali Martinez has pointed out that SHIB has broken the upper boundary of a descending parallel channel at $0.00002444, which means that the popular dog meme token could see an “upswing to $0.00002954,” according to his X post on May 13.

SHIB bullish factors
So, why is Shiba Inu going up today? Notably, SHIB’s recent surprising price movements occurred several days after CoinGate, a blockchain payment processor, added Shiba Inu as a payment method, integrating it with Polygon (MATIC) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) on May 10.

Other than that, there have been no major news or announcements over the weekend related to the Shiba Inu ecosystem that may have assisted in moving the needle in SHIB’s favor, which points to a more meaningful role of technical factors as the main trigger for its sudden rise.
Ultimately, the AI algorithm might be correct in its prognosis, especially considering the token’s recent price action, but it is still just that – a prognosis – which may or may not come true as things in the crypto market can change, so doing one’s own research and keeping up with any SHIB news is important.

Rain Loses $14.8M in April 29 Exploit; Exchange Recovers Funds


							

ZachXBT points out an exploit on Rain exchange that stole $14.8 million in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP.



The exploit possibly happened on April 29 and the stolen funds were immediately transferred into 2 wallets.



Rain updates that the issues were solved and the customer fund is safe.




According to a recent revelation by crypto sleuth ZachXBT, the prominent Middle Eastern cryptocurrency exchange, Rain, was “likely exploited” on April 29 for $14.8 million. The sleuth reported that a suspicious flow of cryptocurrecies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP into two wallets has been identified.



In ZachXBT’s Telegram page, the researcher shared insights on the stolen funds from Rain, which were reportedly transferred into two wallets holding 137.9 BTC and 1,881 ETH. Both wallets remained inactive since they received the stolen funds. ZachXBT’s statement read,




“It appears the crypto exchange Rain was likely exploited for $14.8M on April 29, 2024 after their BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP wallets saw suspicious outflows. Funds were quickly transferred to instant exchanges and swapped for BTC and ETH.”




However, Rain shared an official blog post in response to ZachXBT’s report on the platform’s security breach. The platform assured that the situation was resolved and the customer funds were safe. Rain added, “This means that all your fiat currency and crypto assets are held with the highest standards of security and regulatory compliance.”









Further, Rain narrated its efforts to tackle the situation and strengthen the platform’s security measures. The crypto exchange wrote,




“As soon as we became aware of the incident, we isolated the issue and put additional controls to strengthen our security…All customer and operational activity including crypto buy, sell, send, receive, along with fiat deposit, and withdrawals, remain operational and uninterrupted across all our platforms.”




Blockchain security firm CertiK’s report in April pointed out that the crypto market has witnessed a loss of $502,522,934 in a total of 223 onchain security incidents. The report also highlighted that the losses incurred in crypto attacks in 2024 Q1 are significantly higher than the losses in last year’s first quarter.

CoinShares Sets New Benchmark with Exceptional Q1 2024 Financial Performance | Coinspeaker



The first quarter of this year was the strongest quarter ever as the company’s revenue, gain, and other income rose to £43.9 million, which is 216% higher than the same period last year.

CoinShares International Limited, an asset management company specializing in digital assets, has set a new standard in its financial performance after it released its Q1 financial results for 2024. During this period, the company experienced an exceptional level of expansion and success.
CoinShares in Q1 2024
In a document released, the asset management CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti revealed that the first quarter of this year was the strongest quarter ever as the company’s revenue, gain, and other income rose to £43.9 million, which is 216% higher than the same period last year. Also, the total income for the first quarter reached £34.1 million, compared to just £ 2.9 million in the first quarter of 2023. He said:




“Q1 2024 is our strongest quarter ever, with combined revenues, gains, and income of £43.9 million (+216% YoY) for an adjusted EBITDA of £34.2 million (78% margin).”
Mognetti further mentioned that this achievement is not only about financial performance but also reflects CoinShares’ commitment to expanding its presence worldwide, as recently demonstrated in its acquisition of Valkyrie’s ETF business in March 2024. The acquisition of Valkyrie ETF and the approval of ETFs in the United States are opportunities for CoinShares to further establish itself as the worldwide leader in the asset management industry.
Success Contributors
The asset manager had a lot of inflow from CoinShares Physical, which was essentially part of the improvement in financial performance. This division achieved its highest-ever quarterly performance in management fees, which is about £3.3 million, a considerable increase compared to the same period in 2023, which was £0.6 million. Moreover, the introduction of staking CS physical Ethereum also boosted the performance of CoinShare, which ultimately led to a 64% increase in Asset Under Management (AUM) – £567.2 million to 932.1 million.
Aside from the CoinShare Physical, XBT Provider also contributed to the overall financial performance, earning £15.7 million in fees for the first quarter compared to £8.3 million in the same quarter the previous year. This was made despite experiencing a net outflow of approximately US$238.3 million (£188.6 million) during the quarter (compared to US$27.4 million (£21.7 million) in Q1 2023), but the company still achieved huge fee income.
Hence, the AUM increased by 54% during the quarter, rising from US$2.38 billion (£1.87 billion) to a closing AUM of US$3.65 billion (£2.89 billion).  The Capital Market & Hedge Fund Solutions also delivered top-tier performance bolstered by vibrant market activity and gains from staking and trading.
The company’s board of directors has approved a new dividend policy for the fiscal year 2023, committing to an annual dividend of 20% to 40% of the group’s total comprehensive income. The initial payment was disbursed on May 3rd, and three more are scheduled throughout the year.

Bitcoin, Solana lead the way as crypto inflows rise after 5 weeks - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin contributed $144 million to the investment, while Solana had $5.9 million.
Ethereum’s struggles with regulatory uncertainty triggered outflows from its products.

Bitcoin [BTC] investment products have finally broken the five-week streak of outflows and attracted $144 million in weekly inflows, according to a recent report by CoinShares.
Every week, the digital asset management firm released a detailed about investments in crypto products. For the last five weeks, all of them have ended in massive outflows, despite the initial strong start to the year.
Volume falls, capital rises
But last week, the products were able to amass inflows totaling $130 million. The report linked the hike to the growing interest in crypto products in Hong Kong.
Also, ETFs in the U.S. registered low outflows. However, Bitcoin was not the only cryptocurrency that ensured the record ended in a net positive value.
According to CoinShares, Solana [SOL] also had a hand in it as it registered $5.9 million in inflows.  Despite the improvement, the ETP volume dropped when compared to the average weekly volume in April.
Source: CoinShares
ETP stands for Exchange Traded Products. In April, the average volume was $17 billion. But the metric was not able to match that last week, as it only hit $8 billion.
The decrease indicated a declining interest in interacting with crypto products, with the report noting that,
 “These volumes highlight ETP investors are participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present, representing 22% of total volumes on global trusted exchanges relative to 31% last month.”
At press time, Bitcoin’s price was $62,579. This was a 2.72% increase in the last 24 hours. Solana, on the other hand, changed hands at $148.22— a 7.44% increase within the same period.
BTC and SOL are leaving ETH behind
With this price performance, it could be possible that committing capital to Bitcoin and Solana-related products was a wise choice.
Furthermore, it seemed that the market was getting more and more confident about BTC and SOL. This was evident from the state of their Weighted Sentiment.
Using Santiment’s on-chain data, AMBCrypto noticed that Bitcoin’s Weighted Sentiment was 0.201. This reading implied that comments about the coins have been largely positive.
For SOL, it was -0.429. However, this was a notable improvement from what the metric was on the 12th of May. As such, this was confirmation that the bearish bias around Solana was waning.
Source: Santiment
Meanwhile, Ethereum [ETH] was also on the radar. But this time, it was on the losing end, considering that AMBCrypto reported how the altcoin got more inflows in the previous week.

Realistic or not, here’s SOL’s market cap in BTC terms

Based on the latest data, Ethereum products had outflows worth $14.4 million.
The fading optimism about the approval of the Ethereum ETF application was the major reason for the decline, with CoinShares explaining that,
“Low interaction by the US regulators with ETF issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF has increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent, this has been reflected in outflows which totaled US$14m last week.”

Bitcoin hash rate dips as miners turn off unprofitable ASICs post-halving

Bitcoin hash rate saw a decline as Bitcoin mining firms have started turning off unprofitable mining rigs after the fourth Bitcoin halving.The Bitcoin network’s hash rate fell to an over two-month low of 575 exahash per second (EH/s) on May 10 before making a small recovery to the current 586 EH/s, according to data from blockchain.com.The hash rate drop can be attributed to the fact that “miners are beginning to turn off unprofitable rigs,” according to a May 13 X post by James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares. Source: blockchain.comThe temporary drop was predicted by an April 19 report by CoinShares, which expects hash rate to surge during the next year. According to the report:“Our model forecasts the hash rate rising to 700 exahash by 2025, although after the halving, it could fall by up to 10% as miners turn off unprofitable ASICs.”The temporary reduction is attributed to the increased costs of Bitcoin (BTC) mining due to the halving, along with rising electricity costs, according to the report:“Key mitigation strategies include optimizing energy costs, increasing mining efficiency, and securing favorable hardware procurement terms.”Infrastructure and energy costs remain key for BTC mining profitabilityYet, according to Nazar Khan, the co-founder and COO of TeraWulf, only smaller mining operations with less energy-efficient equipment will be endangered after the 2024 halving. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Khan said:“If you are a firm that just owns a bunch of machines and you are not profitable, you will be challenged. If you are a company that owns quality infrastructure that can deliver low-cost power, that's a real asset and if anything the underlying value of that asset [BTC] has increased…”TeraWulf is the world’s eighth largest Bitcoin mining company, worth over $670 million, according to Companiesmarketcap, planning to further expand its mining operations this year, despite the halving of block rewards.Related: 10 days until halving: Bitcoin mining profitability won’t necessarily fallHowever, the profitability of mining operations largely depends on the cost of electricity the companies are paying. The S19 XP and M50S++, two of the older ASIC models, operate at a loss with electricity costs above $0.09/kWh (Kilowatt-hour), according to a May 2 X post by Hashrate index.“S19 XP & M50S++ will operate at a loss if the hash cost rises >$0.09/kWh. >$0.08/kWh k Pros & M50S+ will be unprofitable. And at $0.06-$0.07/kWh the S19j Pro+, j Pros, and M30S++ will struggle.”Source: Hashrate indexRelated: Runes are offering a significant lifeline for Bitcoin miners — TeraWulf COO

Frontline Bybit Trader Accuses Worldcoin Team of System Manipulation - Coin Edition


							

According to DeFi^2 Worldcoin might become the greatest transfer of wealth in the upcoming bull cycle.



The top trader accused the Worldcoin team of plans to manipulate its system and extort the public.



According to the trader, the Worldcoin team designed WLD to have predatory tokenomics.




According to DeFi^2, a ranked trader on Bybit, Worldcoin might become the most significant transfer of wealth in the upcoming bull cycle. In a post on X, the famous trader alleged that the indicated wealth transfer would be from the public to the pockets of the Worldcoin team and insiders, citing the project’s upcoming WLD unlock and vesting program.







In his opening statement, DeFi^2 accused Worldcoin of being a deceptive project with no link to OpenAI as popularly assumed. He accused the Worldcoin team of planning to sell off the project’s native coin, WLD, as unlocks ramp up in the coming months, which would lead to hyperinflation.



According to the trader, WLD is undergoing a 0.6% daily devaluation from grant emissions and operator claims. He noted that the Worldcoin Foundation has announced it will sell $200 million more WLD tokens to trading firms, marking an additional 18% of the circulating supply to sell at a discount.









Meanwhile, the Bybit top trader highlighted that in just 70 days, when VC and team unlocks begin vesting, WLD supply will begin inflating at 4% PER DAY from unlocks and emissions. From his calculations, he disclosed that the process would lead to $50 million a day of nonstop sell pressure on a coin insiders are hoping to cash out at a $60 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV).



Warning his followers, DeFi^2 highlighted that people design coins like WLD to have predatory tokenomics that benefit the team and early investors. He noted that the Foundation intentionally ended the market maker contract, which prevented the price from squeezing higher on a low float in December. He accused the  Worldcoin team of engaging in actions similar to Sam Bankman-Fried’s routine by manipulating the system to enrich insiders.

Crypto Trader Accuses Worldcoin of Predatory Tokenomics


Crypto trader DeFiSquared shared a comprehensive analysis of the Worldcoin project and its native token—WLD. Their analysis delves into concerns about the project that Sam Altman of OpenAI co-founded, focusing on tokenomics design.
DeFiSquared explained that Worldcoin “realistically” might be the biggest wealth transfer of this cycle. Yet, this may not come as universal basic income as the project’s mission suggests.
DeFiSquared Accused Worldcoin (WLD) of Having “Predatory Tokenomics”
DeFiSquared shared some calculations regarding the WLD token’s hyperinflation. Currently, at a $60 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV), the token is being devalued by 0.6% daily due to emissions from grants and operator claims, mostly sold immediately.
DeFiSquared thinks many investors must be aware of the expected aggressive WLD sell-off. The Worldcoin Foundation announced it will sell $200 million more WLD tokens to trading firms. This transaction will add 18% of the entire circulating supply sold at a discount to counterparties.


“These $200 million of tokens come from the deceptively named ‘Community’ allocation of WLD token supply, yet are being sold to adversarial parties to benefit the foundation,” DeFiSquared noted.

The most important thing, according to DeFiSquared, is that in just 70 days, when the token allocation to venture capital (VC) and teams starts to open, the supply of WLD will increase by 4% per day. That’s nearly $50 million per day of “non-stop selling pressure” on WLD tokens that insiders hope to cash out at an FDV of US$60 billion.
Moreover, DeFiSquared alleged that crypto tokens like Worldcoin were designed to have “predatory tokenomics” since the beginning. DeFiSquared highlighted an event in December 2023 as the prime example of Worldcoin’s predatory tokenomics. At that time, they said that the Worldcoin Foundation intentionally terminated the market maker contract that prevented WLD prices from squeezing higher on low float.

They noticed that the low float, high FDV design is a similar tactic used by Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange FTX. This design also directly enriches insiders as they hedge their locked allocations at high valuations pre-unlock via perpetual or over-the-counter (OTC).

“Yet retail somehow sadly still thinks they’re beating the system trying to push the price up,” they suggested.

DeFiSquared also reminds investors to be alert to some strategically timed announcements between now and the token unlock period for WLD insiders in July. They see that the unlock will most likely create profitable exit liquidity for WLD insiders.
Exit liquidity is a common tactic in the crypto industry. Insiders use hype and announcements to increase the price of select crypto assets. After seeing the price rise, they will sell their holdings, leaving retail investors at potential losses.

Despite public assumptions, DeFiSquared thinks the project has no real connections to the popular artificial intelligence (AI) project—OpenAI. Therefore, they called it “a deceptive project.”
They also flagged that most retail buyers probably need to realize that Sam Altman has no active involvement in Worldcoin. DeFiSquared emphasized that the project is under a completely separate entity from OpenAI.
Historically, OpenAI’s development often influenced WLD’s price performance. BeInCrypto reported last week that WLD surged 30% amid rumors of a new OpenAI search engine product. Additionally, when OpenAI announced Sam Altman’s departure as the company’s CEO, WLD dropped over 13%.

However, OpenAI’s introduction of GPT-4o on Monday has not pushed WLD’s price. At the time of writing, WLD is trading at $5.22. This figure marks a decrease of 11.66% for the last 24 hours.

USA Bans Chinese Cryptocurrency Company! - Bitcoin Sistemi

With the US presidential elections just around the corner, cryptocurrencies have become frequently discussed during the election process.
At this point, presidential candidate Donald Trump, who was previously known for his anti-Bitcoin (BTC) and anti-cryptocurrency views, is now declaring his support for crypto, while the current president and presidential candidate Joe Biden continues his anti-crypto approach.


According to Coindesk, US President Joe Biden ordered the shutdown of the MineOne operation of a cryptocurrency mining company controlled by Chinese investors, located near Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, citing national security risks.
In the statement made by the White House, it was stated that a crypto mining company, mostly owned by Chinese citizens, set up shop within one mile of a US nuclear missile base without the necessary permission.





It was also stated that the company used foreign technology that created national security concerns.
The White House also said that the land where the mining operations were located was acquired in 2022, but the company that owns the land was accused of purchasing the land and starting work there without applying to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and an investigation was launched regarding this.


Biden's stop order also requests the sale of the land in question.
US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in her statement:






“The decision underscores the critical watchdog role that CFIUS serves to ensure that foreign investment does not harm our national security, especially as it relates to transactions involving sensitive U.S. military facilities as well as specialized equipment and technologies.”

                         TRLab’s Audrey Ou’s exploration into the future of digital art, NFTs, and technologyAudrey Ou, CEO and co-founder of TRLab is a frequent speaker on fine art NFTs and an Ivy League graduate of Princeton University and Columbia University. She is steering the TRLab platform towards thinking about the future of fine art as it evolves with the development of technology.NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital tokens. Each token has a specific identity and value. Because of that, Ou immediately identified the potential of blockchain technology in the art world. Her parents founded the Rockbund Art Museum in Shanghai when she was a child. She grew up in the art world before moving on to the tech world.Blockchain technology is perfect for fine art. Blockchain tech ensures the authenticity and ownership of digital art through secure, transparent records that can’t be altered. Artists can create and sell unique digital artworks as NFTs that can be tracked and verified across and beyond their lifetime. Compare this to traditional art collecting: provenance and authenticity can raise concerns even for the strictest museums and auction houses. Art is notorious for forgery, as seen in countless TV shows, and as many documentaries have pointed out, verifying the rightful owner of a piece is tricky, especially when art is lost during times of war.Since their introduction, NFTs have had a passionate following. Audrey and TRLab aim to expand this following by creating a community around fine art NFTs and the artists who create them. TRLab has collaborated with many celebrated artists, but it’s the up-and-coming artists that will shape the future of digital art with the help of Audrey and TRLab.In partnership with Chen Qiufan and Kai-Fu Lee’s book AI 2041: Ten Visions For Our Future, authors and artists came together to represent two promising emerging technologies: AI and blockchain. This partnership highlights the innovation that has made TRLab so successful among investors and collectors.The project invited 7 artists to bring their interpretation of the stories and predictions in Qiufan and Lee’s book. The art, seen worldwide, connects viewers to the book’s message of how AI will come to make our lives easier in expected and sometimes unexpected ways. The NFTs, created by artists who were inspired by the literature, share visions of the future of AI as they are themselves evidence of how digital art is transforming and evolving.Audrey Ou and TRLab have empowered established and emerging artists alike providing a platform that connects them with a global audience and supports their creative freedom. The work that Audrey Ou works on at TRLab encourages digital art to further evolve. At the same time, the artists retain control and rights over their creations, fostering a dynamic and sustainable art ecosystem. About the AuthorDarla Wall is a freelance writer from Trenton, NJ, where she lives with her husband.

Two Bitcoin wallets that have been inactive for over a decade suddenly moved 1,000 BTC, valued at approximately $60.9 million, within the past 20 minutes. These transactions have caught the attention of market analysts and traders alike, sparking curiosity and speculation about potential market impacts.The wallets, identified as “16vRqA” and “1DUJuH,” each received 500 BTC in September 2013, when Bitcoin was priced at $124 per coin. This activity, reported by Lookonchain, raises questions about the motives behind the transfers and whether these movements could signal a significant shift in market dynamics.The sudden reactivation of these long-dormant wallets may indicate upcoming volatility or strategic moves by influential holders, making it crucial for investors to stay informed and vigilant.Bitcoin Price Prediction

Chainlink's Response to Bitcoin's Influence in a Bearish Market


In today’s analysis, we will delve into the recent price action of Chainlink (LINK) and its on-chain activity to understand the underlying trends and potential future movements.
Even though Bitcoin’s price surged from $60,700 to $63,000 within hours. Chainlink’s price failed to surpass the significant mid-term resistance level of $13.7. Curious about the reason? Let’s zoom In for a closer examination.
Chainlink Price Action Remains Bearish
The current price of LINK is trading below a significant yellow range, which is critical to observe over the next few days. This range could act as a resistance level. The fact that the price remains below this range signals a bearish sentiment in the market.

Interestingly, even as Bitcoin recovered to $63,000 yesterday, LINK did not exhibit comparable price appreciation, which aligns with bearish trends observed in similar tokens like PYTH. In addition, a decreasing trading volume has contributed to a deep price correction.

Key Observations:
– Resistance Watch: The yellow range is crucial; breaking above could suggest a bullish reversal, whereas continued resistance confirms bearish pressures.– Comparative Underperformance: Unlike Bitcoin, LINK’s lack of recovery is a point of concern, reflecting broader market uncertainty or specific challenges within the Chainlink ecosystem.– Volume Trends: The decrease in trading volume, coupled with reduced exchange activity, indicates a lack of trader confidence, which could further decline the price.

A closer look at the on-chain metrics reveals that exchange deposits and LINK withdrawals have decreased significantly, leading to very low trading volumes. This drop in active trading volume is a bearish indicator and suggests that the price may continue to face downward pressure, potentially reaching the major mid-term resistance level of $11.9.

Additionally there has been a noticeable decline in the number of new addresses created on the Chainlink network, as depicted in the provided chart. 
This downturn in active address creation correlates closely with the decline in LINK’s price, underscoring a reduced demand from new market investors.

Chainlink is currently exhibiting several bearish signs. The key to its short-term price movement will be its ability to break above the noted resistance range. Investors should monitor trading volumes and exchange activity as indicators of potential shifts in market sentiment.

As always, it’s essential to approach trading cautiously, considering the volatile nature of crypto markets.
LINK Price Projection: How BTC Can Influence Price

Bearish to Neutral Outlook: Chainlink’s price struggles below key resistance, with declining trading volumes and low exchange activity. This indicates strong bearish signals amidst a lack of new investor interest
Bitcoin’s Influence: If Bitcoin continues its upward momentum towards $65,000, it could positively impact Chainlink.
Conditional Resistance: Should Bitcoin fall below $60,800, LINK might experience a notable mid-term price decline, possibly extending its bearish trend.
Price Projections: In the bearish scenario, LINK’s price could potentially fall to $11.9. 
Our recommendations for traders: If Bitcoin hits $60,800, expect LINK to drop 12%. A $65,000 BTC price could boost LINK to $15. Traders should consider waiting to buy LINK at a lower price, around $12 – $12.5. Setting a stop loss at $11.5 and aiming for a sell price of $15 might be a smarter move.

Bitcoin Enters Accumulation Phase, Exiting Post-Halving "Danger Zone," Claims Analyst


                        
                            Bitcoin Enters Accumulation Phase, Exiting Post-Halving “Danger Zone,” Claims Analyst

                        Technical analyst Rekt Capital suggests that Bitcoin has emerged from the post-halving “danger zone” and entered an accumulation phase, as indicated by weakening selling pressure.After previous halving events, Bitcoin typically experienced increased volatility, which came to be known as the “danger zone.”In the current cycle, Bitcoin’s price dropped by a mild 6.5% over three weeks, followed by a 15% surge, signaling a strong exit from the danger zone.“The Post-Halving Bitcoin “Danger Zone” (purple) is officially over,” popular crypto trader Rekt Capital wrote. “And Bitcoin is celebrating with a good bounce from the Re-Accumulation Range Low support.”As of now, Bitcoin is trading at nearly $62,600, reflecting a 3% increase in the past 24 hours.Bitcoin Price to Hold Above $60,000 Support
In a recent blog post, Rekt Capital emphasized the importance of the $60,000 support level for the continuation of the upward trend, with a potential return to the $68,000 mark.“The Bitcoin correction should be over, and price should be able to maintain itself above $60,000 going forward.”While past trends do not guarantee future outcomes, the resilience of the current support level is a positive indicator for Bitcoin’s trajectory.Investors will closely monitor the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on Wednesday, which is forecasted to be 3.4% for CPI and 3.6% for core CPI.Inflation remains a concern, as it exceeds the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. Unless inflation improves, interest rates may remain high for an extended period.Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, believes that rising government debt and adjustments by the Fed and US Treasury make alternative investments like Bitcoin more appealing.Hayes predicts that Bitcoin’s price will surpass $60,000 and stabilize between $60,000 and $70,000 by August.The outcome of the upcoming US presidential election could also impact Bitcoin’s value, according to Standard Chartered.The bank suggests that a potential win for Donald Trump might be beneficial for Bitcoin, considering potential shifts in fiscal and monetary policies.Standard Chartered expects Bitcoin’s price to reach $150,000 by the end of the year and $200,000 by 2025.Pantera Capital Bullish on Bitcoin
As reported, crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital has reiterated its bullish stance on Bitcoin. It predicts a potential surge in price to $114,000 by August 2025.The forecast comes as the industry grapples with challenges such as inflation concerns, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and the escalating Middle East crisis.Utilizing a stock-to-flow model, Pantera assessed the supply of Bitcoin in relation to the rate of new production, which is designed to decrease by 50% every four years during halving events.Historical data shows that Bitcoin’s price has experienced significant increases, sometimes up to 93-fold, in response to these events.By studying both pre-halving and post-halving rallies, Pantera Capital determined that, on average, prices tend to reach their peak approximately 2.6 years after halving events.Based on this analysis, the projected timeframe for Bitcoin’s potential surge aligns with August next year.

Ripple v. SEC case update as of May 14, 2024


As the cryptocurrency community continues to sit tight for the final outcome of the long-running courtroom battle between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the blockchain company has asked the court to seal certain documents.
Specifically, Ripple has filed a motion to seal specific documents filed in connection with the SEC’s motion for judgment and remedies, according to a document shared by a defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, James K. Filan, in an X post on May 14.

Ripple v. SEC: Confidential financial data
Among other things, the court document addressed to Judge Analisa Torres seeks sealing or redacting confidential information, including the company’s “negotiated financial terms of its contractual agreements with certain third-party business partners.” 



“Ripple’s proposed redactions are narrow and target only the specific financial and pricing terms that Ripple and certain of its past or existing counterparties negotiated, and the Court granted Ripple’s identical or similar proposed redactions in connection with the Summary Judgment and Daubert motions.”

On top of that, Ripple’s chief financial officer, Jonathan Bilich, has filed a declaration in support of the firm’s motion to seal, arguing that “Ripple is a private company” that “undertakes significant efforts to protect the confidentiality of its sensitive and proprietary business information.”

“Its disclosure to the public would be detrimental to Ripple’s business relationships with customers and other counterparties and harm Ripple’s competitive standing in the marketplace.”

Discounts to institutional buyers
According to a lawyer and popular commentator on the case, Bill Morgan, this means that Ripple’s legal team is purportedly seeking to seal certain discounts offered to institutional XRP buyers, further explaining that a “company has every right to seek and protect commercially sensitive information.”

As a reminder, the securities regulator has earlier filed its remedies reply brief and supporting exhibits, in which the SEC is trying to justify the need for injunctions, arguing that Ripple’s claims refuting the accusations of acting recklessly were “contrary to evidence,” as Finbold reported on May 10.
In fact, the SEC has accused Ripple of planning “to issue a new unregistered crypto asset,” referring to the company’s announcement on April 4, 2024, of the planned dollar-pegged stablecoin release as evidence of its continuous violations.
Meanwhile, XRP, the token at the center of the protracted legal standoff, was at press time changing hands at the price of $0.51, which indicates an increase of 0.5% on the day, a loss of 6.64% across the past week, and a 2.28% gain in the last month, as per data on May 14.

Coinbase Suffers Critical Outage: Were Your Funds Safe? - DailyCoin


        

Coinbase suffered a system-wide outage on Tuesday.



The exchange has issued several alerts since the issue began.



Users contemplated whether funds were safe following the glitch.   




The largest crypto exchange in the U.S., Coinbase, suffered a critical “system-wide outage” on May 14, rendering the platform inaccessible via mobile phone or desktop for hours.



On Tuesday at around 4:15 AM UTC, Coinbase notified its users of the outage, noting that its team was investigating the issue and working on a solution. At the time, the exchange’s website displayed a “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” error when accessed.




As the investigation was underway, users contemplated whether their funds were safe. Even more intriguing, the exchange warned users about possible transaction failures after it claimed the issue was resolved.



Coinbase ‘Resolves ‘System Outage



Hours after the glitch, Coinbase reported that the “system-wide” outage had been resolved.



“Coinbase is now fully recovered. We appreciate your patience and apologize for the inconvenience,” the exchange wrote on X.



However, while the alert was a relief to some confused users who hadn’t been issued with a detailed explanation of what transpired as of press time, it didn’t inspire confidence among some X users.



Specifically, a user by the name “rocket” responded to Coinbase’s alert, terming the tweet “false.”




“@X can we get community notes here. This tweet is false as millions of people are still unable to withdraw or transfer their assets.” The user wrote.



Tens of other users claimed that they couldn’t send or withdraw their funds, so Coinbase issued another alert.



Were Funds Safe During the Outage?



While all the alerts issued by Coinbase since the start of the outage and after the supposed recovery reiterated that user funds were safe, the exchange acknowledged that users might experience issues when sending crypto or withdrawing fiat from its platform.



“Some users may still experience failures when sending crypto or withdrawing fiat. We are continuing to investigate this issue and will provide an update shortly. Rest assured, your funds are safe,” Coinbase stated.



At last check, the exchange had issued another alert, claiming “the issue has been identified and a fix is being implemented.” In the meantime, it seems users will believe that funds are safe if they can conduct normal transfers without glitches.

Coinbase claims full recovery after system-wide outage - Crypto Briefing




US crypto exchange Coinbase has been grappling with a “system-wide outage” since 12:15 am ET earlier today, rendering its services inaccessible to users attempting to access the platform via desktop or mobile.The exchange has been regularly updating its official status page and social media channels, assuring users that their funds remain secure. In its latest post on X, the exchange says that it has “fully recovered” from the incident.Despite this, users are still reporting access issues to Coinbase’ platform, with some requesting X for community notes on the matter. Community notes on X is a user-driven feature where contributors are allowed to provide context, fact-checks, and helpful information under posts, images, or videos with the aim of countering disinformation by allowing users from different perspectives to collaboratively contribute notes.Due to the outage, users attempting to visit the Coinbase website have been met with a “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” error message, indicating that the servers are either down for maintenance or overloaded.The status page has shown progress through the various stages of addressing the outage, from investigating to identifying the problem and monitoring the effectiveness of the implemented fix. Despite the challenges, Coinbase has maintained transparency about its troubleshooting process and has reiterated that all user funds are safe.By 4:16 AM ET, the status page stated that a fix has been implemented and results after the fix are being monitored. Some 42 minutes later, the page stated that the Coinbase team is still “currently” investigating the issue, implying that the implemented fix did not work out as planned.This is not the first time Coinbase has experienced an outage. On February 28, the exchange, along with several others, suffered temporary outages due to a rapid uptick in crypto trading activity during a Bitcoin (BTC) flash crash that saw the asset price fall nearly 10% before spiking back up. This happened again as Bitcoin reached the $67K level during the first week of March 2024.While outages can be frustrating for users, some in the crypto community view surges in traffic that cause extended periods of downtime as a bullish sign, indicating increased interest and activity in the cryptocurrency market.

Wallets Dormant Since 2013 Abruptly Move Over $60,000,000 in Bitcoin (BTC) - Here’s Where the Crypto’s Headed - The Daily Hodl


								Two wallets that held a combined 1,000 Bitcoin (BTC) for more than 10 years have suddenly awoken from their slumber, according to on-chain data.
The crypto tracker Lookonchain notes that the first wallet received 500 BTC worth $62,000 on Sept 12th, 2013, when the price of Bitcoin was $124. 










The second wallet received the same amount at the same price the following day.
After more than 10 years of dormancy, both wallets transferred out all of their holdings in a 20-minute span over the weekend. The Bitcoin troves were worth a combined $60.9 million, a staggering increase of 49,012.9%.
Data from the digital asset de-anonymizing platform Arkham indicates the crypto was sent to two newly created wallets. One of the addresses still holds 500 BTC, while the other one sent the Bitcoin through a series of other fresh wallets.
In April, Ki Young Ju, the chief executive of blockchain intelligence platform CryptoQuant, noted that newer crypto whales – or investors that his firm defines as holding at least 1,000 Bitcoin with an average coin age of less than 155 days – had accumulated nearly twice as much BTC as their long-term holder counterparts.
BTC is trading at $62,568 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 2% in the past 24 hours.
